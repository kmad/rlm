RIN 0584–AE94 
Special Supplemental Nutrition 
Program for Women, Infants, and 
Children (WIC): Implementation of the 
Access to Baby Formula Act of 2022 
and Related Provisions; Correcting 
Amendments 
AGENCY: Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), USDA. 
ACTION: Correcting amendments. SUMMARY: On December 14, 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food 
and Nutrition Service (FNS) published a 
final rule that went into effect on 
February 12, 2024. The rule amended 
the Special Supplemental Nutrition 
Program for Women, Infants, and 
Children (WIC) regulations to 
implement the provisions of the Access 
to Baby Formula Act of 2022 (ABFA) 
and make related amendments. In 
reviewing the resulting changes to the 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), FNS 
found that the final rule inadvertently 
omitted provisions from the CFR and 
contained several non-substantive 
errors. This document corrects those 
errors in the WIC regulations. 
DATES: Effective on December 17, 2025. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Allison Post, Chief, WIC 
Administration, Benefits, and 
Certification Branch, Policy Division,

Programs, Food and Nutrition Service,

Allison.Post@usda.gov. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FNS published a final rule with request for 
comments in the Federal Register on 
December 14, 2023 (88 FR 86545), titled 
Special Supplemental Nutrition 
Program for Women, Infants, and 
Children (WIC): Implementation of the 
Access to Baby Formula Act of 2022 and 
Related Provisions. The rule, which 
went into effect on February 12, 2024, 
revised the Special Supplemental 
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, 
and Children (WIC) regulations at 7 CFR 
part 246 to incorporate Access to Baby 
Formula Act of 2022 (ABFA; Pub. L. 
117–129) provisions and to make related 
amendments. The rule included changes 
to the introductory text of 
§ 246.16a(c)(5) to clarify terminology 
describing bidders for infant formula 
cost containment contracts. In making 
this change, subparagraphs (i) through 
(iii) of § 246.16a(c)(5) were 
inadvertently removed, leaving only the 
introductory text of § 246.16a(c)(5). This 
action reintroduces the inadvertently 
omitted provisions. Additionally, the 
rule introduced several non-substantive 
errors into the WIC regulations. This 
action corrects those errors by: 
DEditing definitions at § 246.2 to spell out the acronym ‘‘FDA’’ in the 
definition of ‘‘recall’’ and to clarify 
phrasing in the definition of ‘‘supply 
chain disruption.’’ 
DStandardizing a repeated list of program disruptions used throughout 
§ 246.4(a)(30) and adding missing semi- 
colons to § 246.4(a)(30)(i)(B) and (C). 
DAdding the word ‘‘transaction’’ to § 246.4(a)(30)(i)(F) to correct 
terminology. The word ‘‘redemption’’ is 
currently used incorrectly to refer to 
both participant transactions and 
vendor redemptions. 
DCorrecting capitalization in § 246.16a(n)(2) and § 246.29(a).

a. Add paragraphs (c)(5)(i) through 
(iii); and

The addition and revision read as 
follows: 
§ 246.16a Infant formula and authorized 
foods cost containment. 
* * * * * 
(c) * * * 
(5) * * * 
(i) Calculating the standardized number of units of infant formula. The 
State agency must specify a 
standardized number of units (e.g., cans) of infant formula by physical form (e.g., 
concentrated liquid, powdered, and 
ready-to-feed) to be bid upon. The 
standardized number of units must 
contain the equivalent of the total 
number of ounces by physical form 
needed to give the maximum allowance 
to the average monthly number of 
infants using each form. The number of 
infants does not include infant 
participants who are exclusively 
breastfed and those who are issued 
exempt infant formula. The average 
monthly number of infants using each 
physical form must be based on at least 
6 months of the most recent 
participation and issuance data. In order 
to calculate the standardized number of 
units of infant formula by form to be bid 
upon, the average monthly number of 
infants using each physical form is 
multiplied by the maximum monthly 
allowable number of ounces for each 
form (as allowed under table 1 to 
§ 246.10(e)(9)), and divided by the 
corresponding unit size (i.e., number of ounces per unit being bid). In order to 
compare bids, total cost is calculated by 
multiplying this standardized number of 
units by the net price for each physical 
form. Alternative calculations that 
arrive at a mathematically equivalent 
result are acceptable. 
(ii) Determining the lowest total monthly net price or highest rebate. To 
determine the lowest total monthly net 
price a State agency must multiply the 
net price per unit by the established 
standardized amount of infant formula 
to be bid upon as calculated in 
paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section. If the 
bid evaluation is based on highest rebate 
offered, the State agency must multiply 
the rebate offered by the established 
amount of infant formula to be bid upon 
as calculated in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of 
this section. 
(iii) Highest rebate limitation. Before issuing the bid solicitation, a State 
agency that elects to evaluate bids by 
highest rebate must demonstrate to 
FNS’s satisfaction that the weighted 
average retail prices for different brands 
of infant formula in the State vary by 5 
percent or less. The weighted average 
retail price must take into account the 
prices charged for each type and 
physical form of infant formula by 
authorized vendors or, if a State agency 
elects, it may include stores that do not 
participate in the WIC program in the 
State. The State agency must also base 
calculations on the proportion of each 
type and physical form of infant formula 
the State agency issues based on the 
data provided to bidders pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(5) of this section. 
* * * * * 
(n) * * * 
(2) Allow the issuance of non-contract 
brand infant formulas without medical 
documentation, with the exception of 
participants receiving Food Package III 
as defined in § 246.10(e)(3); and 
* * * * * 
5. In § 246.29: 
a. Revise the last sentence of the 
introductory text of paragraph (a); and 
b. Revise the introductory text of 
paragraph (c). 
The revisions read as follows: 
§ 246.29 Waivers of program 
requirements. 
(a) * * * To be considered, a waiver 
or modification issued under this 
section must meet the following 
requirements:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
In FR Doc. 2025–14780 of August 5, 
2025, the FY 2026 IRF final rule (90 FR 
37678), there were typographical and 
technical errors that are identified and 
corrected in this correcting document. 
II. Summary of Errors 
A. Summary of Errors in the Preamble 
On pages 37678, 37681, 37698, 37699, 
37718, 37719, 37720, 37721, and 37724, 
due to a technical error in the 
calculation of the final FY 2026 IRF PPS 
payment rates, we inadvertently 
excluded a provider from the FY 2026 
payment rate analysis and impacts, 
which required recalculation of the 
payment rates and impact analysis. 
On page 37681, we included an 
incorrect section reference. 
B. Summary of Errors and Corrections 
Posted on the CMS Website for the IRF 
Wage Index 
After the FY 2026 IRF PPS final rule 
was published, we identified CMS 
Certification Numbers (CCNs) with more 
than 6 characters in the provider- 
specific file indicating there are 
providers with multiple records that 
have different provider characteristics. 
In the FY 2026 IRF PPS final rule, we 
inadvertently only included records 
with 6 character CCNs in our rate setting 
analysis resulting in one IRF provider 
being excluded from the rate setting 
data. Therefore, in this document we 
include that provider record with more 
than 6 characters with the most recent 
effective date. The inclusion of the 236 
claims from this provider resulted in a 
change to the outlier threshold (section 
VI. of the FY 2026 IRF PPS final rule) 
and changes to the estimated payment 
impacts (section VII. of the FY 2026 IRF 
PPS final rule). 
III. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 
and Delay in Effective Date 
Section 1871(b)(1) of the Social 
Security Act (the Act) requires the 
Secretary to provide for notice of a 
proposed rule in the Federal Register 
and provide a period of not less than 60 
days for public comment. In addition, 
section 1871(e)(1)(B)(i) of the Act 
mandates a 30-day delay in effective 
date after issuance or publication of a 
rule. Section 1871(b)(2)(C) of the Act 
provides an exception from the notice 
and 60-day comment period and delay 
in effective date requirements of the 
Act, under the good cause standard set 
forth in 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). Section 
1871(e)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act provides an 
exception from the delay in effective 
date requirements of the Act as well. 
Section 553(b)(B) authorizes an agency 
to dispense with normal notice and 
comment rulemaking procedures for 
good cause if the agency makes a 
finding that the notice and comment 
process is impracticable, unnecessary, 
or contrary to the public interest, and 
includes a statement of the finding and 
the reasons for it in the rule. In addition, 
section 1871(e)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act 
allows the agency to avoid the 30-day 
delay in effective date where the waiver 
is necessary to comply with statutory 
requirements or such delay is contrary 
to the public interest and the agency 
includes in the rule a statement of the 
finding and the reasons for it. In our 
view, this correcting document does not 
constitute a rulemaking that would be 
subject to these requirements. 
This document merely corrects 
typographical and technical errors in 
the FY 2026 IRF final rule. The 
corrections contained in this document 
are consistent with, and do not make 
substantive changes to, the policies and 
payment methodologies that were 
proposed, subject to notice and

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES58510 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations comment procedures, and adopted in 
the FY 2026 IRF final rule. As a result, 
the corrections made through this 
correcting document are intended to 
resolve inadvertent errors so that the 
rule accurately reflects the policies 
adopted in the final rule. Even if this 
were a rulemaking to which the notice 
and comment and delayed effective date 
requirements applied, we find that there 
is good cause to waive such 
requirements. Undertaking further 
notice and comment procedures to 
incorporate the corrections in this 
document into the FY 2026 IRF final 
rule or delaying the effective date of the 
corrections would be contrary to the 
public interest because it is in the 
public interest to ensure that the rule 
accurately reflects our policies as of the 
date they take effect. Further, such 
procedures would be unnecessary 
because we are not making any 
substantive revisions to the final rule, 
but rather, we are simply correcting the 
Federal Register document to reflect the 
policies that we previously proposed, 
received public comment on, and 
subsequently finalized in the final rule. 
For these reasons, we believe there is 
good cause to waive the requirements 
for notice and comment and delay in 
effective date.

Identifier MCAI–2024–00399–R] 
RIN 2120–AA64 
Airworthiness Directives; Airbus 
Helicopters 
AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 
SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 
2023–01–04, which applies to all Airbus 
Helicopters Model AS350B, AS350BA, 
AS350B1, AS350B2, AS350B3, AS350D, 
AS355E, AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, 
AS355N, and AS355NP helicopters. AD 
2023–01–04 requires, for helicopters 
with certain part-numbered tail rotor 
head (TRH) spider pitch change units 
installed, inspecting the spider pitch 
change nut (nut) for correct installation; 
marking a 2 to 5 mm wide black paint 
index mark and repetitively inspecting 
the alignment of the marking; and 
performing additional inspections and 
corrective actions if necessary. Since the 
FAA issued AD 2023–01–04, new or 
more restrictive airworthiness 
limitations were issued, which 
terminated the requirement for the 
repetitive inspections of the black paint 
index marking. This proposed AD 
would require the same actions of AD 
2023–01–04, except for the repetitive 
black paint index marking inspection 
and would prohibit installing certain 
parts unless certain requirements are 
met. The FAA is proposing this AD to 
address the unsafe condition on these 
products. 
DATES: The FAA must receive comments on this NPRM by February 2, 2026.

Background 
The FAA issued AD 2023–01–04, 
Amendment 39–22298 (88 FR 6618, 
February 1, 2023) (AD 2023–01–04), for 
Airbus Helicopters Model AS350B, 
AS350BA, AS350B1, AS350B2, 
AS350B3, AS350D, AS355E, AS355F, 
AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, and 
AS355NP helicopters. AD 2023–01–04 
was prompted by an MCAI originated by 
the European Union Aviation Safety 
Agency (EASA), which is the Technical 
Agent for the Member States of the 
European Union. EASA issued AD 
2021–0282, dated December 17, 2021 
(EASA AD 2021–0282), to address loss 
of the TRH pitch change control.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS58513 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Proposed Rules AD 2023–01–04 requires, for 
helicopters with certain part-numbered 
TRH pitch change units installed, 
inspecting for correct installation of the 
nut; marking a 2 to 5 mm wide black 
paint index mark to identify the 
position of certain parts; and after the 
initial marking, repetitively inspecting 
the alignment of the marking; and 
additional inspections and corrective 
actions if necessary. Additionally, AD 
2023–01–04 prohibits installing an 
affected part on a helicopter unless 
certain requirements are met. The FAA 
issued AD 2023–01–04 to detect 
improper installation of the nut and 
improper alignment of a black index 
marking. 
Actions Since AD 2023–01–04 Was 
Issued 
Since the FAA issued AD 2023–01– 
04, EASA superseded AD 2021–0282 
and issued EASA AD 2021–0282R1, 
Revision 1, dated July 10, 2024 (EASA 
AD 2021–0282R1) (also referred to as 
the MCAI), to address an unsafe 
condition on all Airbus Helicopters 
Model AS 350 B, AS 350 BA, AS 350 
BB, AS 350 B1, AS 350 B2, AS 350 B3, 
AS 350 D, AS 355 E, AS 355 F, AS 355 
F1, AS 355 F2, AS 355 N, and AS 355 
NP helicopters. The MCAI states the 
manufacturer revised the Airworthiness 
Limitations Section (ALS), as 
applicable, which now includes the 
repetitive black index marking checks 
(inspections). 
Additionally, for this NPRM, the FAA 
is updating the name of the TRH spider 
pitch change unit to TRH pitch change 
unit as defined in the required material. 
The FAA is issuing this proposed AD to 
detect improper installation of the nut 
and improper alignment of a black 
index marking. The unsafe condition, if 
not addressed, could result in loss of the 
TRH pitch change control and 
consequent loss of control of the 
helicopter. 
You may examine the MCAI in the 
AD docket at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA–2025–5387. 
Relationship Between This Proposed 
AD and Other Relevant Rulemaking 
EASA AD 2021–0282R1 specifies that 
the manufacturer revised the ALS, for 
Airbus Helicopters Model AS350 and 
AS355 helicopters as applicable. The 
revised ALS for each model now 
incorporates the periodic black index 
marking inspections. The FAA is 
evaluating this issue and may take 
further rulemaking action to 
accommodate these ALS amendments. 
Material Incorporated by Reference 
Under 1 CFR Part 51 
The FAA reviewed Airbus Helicopters 
Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 
AS350–05.01.03, and Airbus 
Helicopters ASB No. AS355–05.00.86, 
both Revision 0 and dated July 8, 2024, 
which include Figure 1 that identifies 
the position of the TRH pitch change 
unit and of the bearing spacer to be 
marked with a 2 to 5 mm wide black 
paint index mark. This material also 
specifies procedures for inspecting the 
condition and installation of the nut; 
and inspecting the application and 
alignment of the black index mark on 
the TRH pitch change unit and the 
bearing spacer. 
This material is reasonably available 
because the interested parties have 
access to it through their normal course 
of business or by the means identified 
in the 
ADDRESSESsection. 
FAA’s Determination 
These products have been approved 
by the civil aviation authority of another 
country and are approved for operation 
in the United States. Pursuant to the 
FAA’s bilateral agreement with this 
State of Design Authority, it has notified 
the FAA of the unsafe condition 
described in the MCAI and material 
referenced above. The FAA is issuing 
this NPRM after determining that the 
unsafe condition described previously is 
likely to exist or develop on other 
products of the same type design. 
Proposed AD Requirements in This 
NPRM 
This proposed AD would require the 
same actions as AD 2023–01–04 except 
it would only require the initial black 
paint index marking inspection, not the 
repetitive inspections. Additionally, this 
proposed AD would prohibit installing 
an affected part on a helicopter unless 
certain requirements are met. 
Differences Between This Proposed AD 
and the MCAI 
The MCAI applies to Airbus 
Helicopters Model AS350BB, whereas 
this proposed AD does not because that 
model does not have an FAA type 
certificate. 
Costs of Compliance 
The FAA estimates that this AD, if 
adopted as proposed, would affect 972 
helicopters of U.S. registry. 
The FAA estimates the following 
costs to comply with this proposed AD.

no way of determining the number of 
helicopters that might need these 
repairs or replacements.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS58514 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Proposed Rules Authority for This Rulemaking 
Title 49 of the United States Code 
specifies the FAA’s authority to issue 
rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, 
section 106, describes the authority of 
the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, 
Aviation Programs, describes in more 
detail the scope of the Agency’s 
authority. 
The FAA is issuing this rulemaking 
under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 
44701: General requirements. Under 
that section, Congress charges the FAA 
with promoting safe flight of civil 
aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
regulations for practices, methods, and 
procedures the Administrator finds 
necessary for safety in air commerce. 
This regulation is within the scope of 
that authority because it addresses an 
unsafe condition that is likely to exist or 
develop on products identified in this 
rulemaking action. 
Regulatory Findings 
The FAA determined that this 
proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 
13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the 
States, on the relationship between the 
national Government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
For the reasons discussed above, I 
certify that the proposed regulation: 
(1) Is not a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ under Executive Order 12866, 
(2) Would not affect intrastate 
aviation in Alaska, and 
(3) Would not have a significant 
economic impact, positive or negative, 
on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. 
List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 
Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation 
safety, Incorporation by reference, 
Safety. 
The Proposed Amendment 
Accordingly, under the authority 
delegated to me by the Administrator, 
the FAA proposes to amend 14 CFR part 
39 as follows: 
PART 39—AIRWORTHINESS 
DIRECTIVES 
1. The authority citation for part 39 
continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701. § 39.13 [Amended] 
2. The FAA amends § 39.13 by: 
a. Removing Airworthiness Directive 
2023–01–04, Amendment 39–22298 (88 
FR 6618, February 1, 2023); and 
b. Adding the following new 
airworthiness directive: 
Airbus Helicopters: Docket No. FAA–2025– 
5387; Project Identifier MCAI–2024– 
00399–R. 
(a) Comments Due Date 
The FAA must receive comments on this 
airworthiness directive (AD) by February 2, 
2026. 
(b) Affected ADs 
This AD replaces AD 2023–01–04, 
Amendment 39–22298 (88 FR 6618, February 
1, 2023). 
(c) Applicability 
This AD applies to Airbus Helicopters 
Model AS350B, AS350BA, AS350B1, 
AS350B2, AS350B3, AS350D, AS355E, 
AS355F, AS355F1, AS355F2, AS355N, and 
AS355NP helicopters, certificated in any 
category.

AS350B3e designation are Model AS350B3 
helicopters. 
(d) Subject 
Joint Aircraft System Component (JASC) 
Code 6420, Tail rotor head. 
(e) Unsafe Condition 
This AD was prompted by an occurrence 
reported where, during an inspection of a tail 
rotor head (TRH) pitch change unit, excessive 
play and excessive wear were detected, due 
to an unwanted rotating motion and updated 
airworthiness limitations and maintenance 
tasks. The FAA is issuing this AD to detect 
improper installation of the pitch change 
spider nut (nut) and improper alignment of 
a black index marking. The unsafe condition, 
if not addressed, could result in loss of the 
TRH pitch change control and consequent 
loss of control of the helicopter. 
(f) Compliance 
Comply with this AD within the 
compliance times specified, unless already 
done. 
(g) Required Actions 
(1) For helicopters with TRH pitch change 
unit, part number (P/N) 350A33–2030–00, 
350A33–2167–00, or 350A33–2167–01 
installed, within 50 hours time-in-service 
(TIS) after the effective date of this AD, 
inspect the nut for correct installation. If the 
nut is missing or loose, before further flight, 
remove the bearing from the TRH pitch 
change unit and do the following: 
(i) Inspect the TRH pitch change unit for 
corrosion. If there is any corrosion, before 
further flight, remove the affected part from 
service and replace with an airworthy part. 
Note 2 to paragraph (g)(1)(i): Airbus 
Helicopters Mechanical Repair Manual

Airworthiness Directives; Airbus 
Helicopters 
AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 
SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 
2020–09–15, which applies to certain 
Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, 
AS332C1, AS332L, and AS332L1 
helicopters. AD 2020–09–15 requires 
removing the removable parts of the 
dual hoist installation or removing the 
de-icing system and allows, for certain 
helicopters, revising the rotorcraft flight 
manual (RFM) for the helicopter and 
installing a placard as an optional 
method of compliance. Since the FAA 
issued AD 2020–09–15, analysis 
revealed that additional vibration level 
measurements are necessary. This 
proposed AD would retain all the 
requirements of AD 2020–09–15 and 
would require for certain helicopters 
repetitively measuring vibration levels 
in-flight, and depending on the results, 
performing corrective actions. The FAA 
is proposing this AD to address the 
unsafe condition on these products. 
DATES: The FAA must receive comments on this NPRM by February 2, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: You may send comments, using the procedures found in 14 CFR 
11.43 and 11.45, by any of the following

Background 
The FAA issued AD 2020–09–15, 
Amendment 39–19911 (85 FR 30589, 
May 20, 2020) (AD 2020–09–15), for 
Airbus Helicopters Model AS332C, 
AS332C1, AS332L, and AS332L1 
helicopters equipped with a dual hoist 
installation and de-icing system, except 
those that have Airbus Helicopters 
modification 0722907 installed in 
production. AD 2020–09–15 was 
prompted by an MCAI originated by the 
European Union Aviation Safety Agency 
(EASA), which is the Technical Agent 
for the Member States of the European 
Union. EASA issued AD 2018–0142R1, 
dated December 9, 2019 (EASA AD 
2018–0142R1) to address vibrations 
around the 12Hz frequency. EASA AD 
2018–0142R1 states that during the first 
flight of an Airbus Helicopters Model 
AS332L helicopter after a retrofit that 
re-installed the deicing system, 
vibrations around the 12Hz frequency 
were observed. Subsequent flight tests 
and analysis determined that this 
vibration is due to the specific 
helicopter configuration. Factors that 
contributed to the vibration included 
simultaneous installation of riveted 
main frames X3855 and X5295 (pre- 
Airbus Helicopter modification 
0722907), additional weight created by 
parts of the rotor de-icing system on the 
main rotor head (the distributor and de- 
icing harnesses), and removable parts 
(hoist arm and hoists) of the dual hoist 
installation. 
AD 2020–09–15 requires removing the 
removable parts of the dual hoist 
installation or removing the de-icing 
system, and allows, for certain 
helicopters, revising the RFM for the 
helicopter and installing a placard as an 
optional method of compliance. The 
FAA issued AD 2020–09–15 to address 
vibrations around the 12Hz frequency. 
The unsafe condition, if not addressed, 
could generate divergent aeromechanic 
coupling between the helicopter 
structure and the rotor, possibly 
resulting in mechanical failure of 
structural parts and loss of control of the 
helicopter. 
Actions Since AD 2020–09–15 Was 
Issued 
Since the FAA issued AD 2020–09– 
15, EASA issued EASA AD 2024–0100, 
dated May 10, 2024 (EASA AD 2024– 
0100), which superseded EASA AD 
2018–0142R1. EASA AD 2024–0100 
stated that the same occurrence of the 
12Hz vibratory condition was reported 
on a helicopter with Airbus Helicopters 
modification 0722907 embodied and 
that it was necessary for all helicopters 
with this modification to measure 
vibrations in-flight, interpret the results, 
and depending on the results, send the 
vibration levels to Airbus Helicopters or 
modify the helicopter configuration. 
After EASA issued EASA AD 2024– 
0100, EASA superseded EASA AD 
2024–0100 and issued EASA AD 2024– 
0233, dated December 5, 2024 (EASA 
AD 2024–0233) (also referred to as the 
MCAI). The MCAI states that since 
EASA AD 2024–0100 was issued, it was 
determined that further vibration level 
measurements were necessary after 
performing certain maintenance tasks. 
The MCAI further states that EASA AD 
2024–0233 is considered to be an 
interim action. 
This condition, if not addressed, 
could generate divergent aeromechanic 
coupling between the helicopter 
structure and the rotor, possibly 
resulting in mechanical failure of 
structural parts and loss of control of the 
helicopter. 
You may examine the MCAI in the 
AD docket at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA–2025–5389. 
Material Incorporated by Reference 
Under 1 CFR Part 51 
The FAA reviewed Airbus Helicopters 
Alert Service Bulletin AS332–04–00– 
0001 Issue 002, dated December 4, 2024 
(ASB AS332–04–00–0001), which 
specifies procedures for installing the 
accelerometer in the cockpit of the 
helicopter, repetitively inspecting the 
vibration level at 12 Hz each time a 
specific maintenance task is completed, 
and interpreting the results. Depending 
on the results of this inspection, ASB 
AS332–04–00–0001 specifies 
procedures for corrective actions, which 
include changing the configuration by 
either removing the dual hoist system or 
removing the de-icing harness and 
contacting Airbus Helicopters for 
further instructions. 
This proposed AD would also require 
Airbus Helicopters Emergency Alert 
Service Bulletin (EASB) No. 01.00.91 
Revision 1 (EASB 01.00.91 Rev 1) for 
Model AS332C, and AS332C1 
helicopters, and EASB No. 01.00.96 
Revision 0 (EASB 01.00.96) for Model 
AS332L and AS332L1 helicopters, both 
dated December 4, 2019. EASB 01.00.91 
Rev 1 specifies procedures for removing 
parts of the dual hoist installation or 
removing the de-icing system. EASB 
01.00.96 describes procedures for 
amending the RFM of Airbus 
Helicopters Model AS332L and 
AS332L1 helicopters to limit the flight 
envelope and the Vne and installing a 
placard. EASB 01.00.96 also describes 
procedures for removing parts of the 
dual hoist installation or removing the 
de-icing system. The Director of the 
Federal Register approved EASB 
01.00.91 Rev 1 and EASB 01.00.96 for 
incorporation by reference as of May 20, 
2020 (85 FR 30589, May 20, 2020). 
This material is reasonably available 
because the interested parties have 
access to it through their normal course 
of business or by the means identified 
in the 
ADDRESSESsection. 
FAA’s Determination 
These products have been approved 
by the aviation authority of another 
country and are approved for operation 
in the United States. Pursuant to the 
FAA’s bilateral agreement with this 
State of Design Authority, it has notified 
the FAA of the unsafe condition 
described in the MCAI referenced 
above. The FAA is issuing this NPRM 
after determining that the unsafe 
condition described previously is likely 
to exist or develop on other products of 
the same type design. 
Proposed AD Requirements in This 
NPRM 
This proposed AD would retain all 
the requirements of AD 2020–09–15 and 
would require repetitively measuring 
the vibration level, interpreting the 
results, and depending on the results, 
removing certain parts and further 
inspections. This proposed AD would 
also allow an alternative to removing 
parts by placing a placard and revising 
the RFM for the helicopter. 
Measuring the vibration levels in- 
flight and revising the existing RFM for 
the helicopter may be performed by the 
owner/operator (pilot) holding at least a 
private pilot certificate and must be 
entered into the aircraft records showing 
compliance with this action in 
accordance with 14 CFR 43.9(a) and 
91.417(a)(2)(v). The pilot may perform 
these actions because they only involve 
recording data in-flight and revising the 
existing RFM by inserting pages, which 
are not considered maintenance actions. 
This proposed AD would also prohibit 
installing the de-icing system and the

are accomplished. 
Interim Action 
The FAA considers that this proposed 
AD would be an interim action. If final 
action is later identified, the FAA might 
consider further rulemaking. 
Costs of Compliance 
The FAA estimates that this AD, if 
adopted as proposed, would affect five 
helicopters of U.S. registry. 
The FAA estimates the following 
costs to comply with this proposed AD. 
ESTIMATEDCOSTS

Title 49 of the United States Code 
specifies the FAA’s authority to issue 
rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, 
section 106, describes the authority of 
the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, 
Aviation Programs, describes in more 
detail the scope of the Agency’s 
authority. 
The FAA is issuing this rulemaking 
under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 
44701: General requirements. Under 
that section, Congress charges the FAA 
with promoting safe flight of civil 
aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
regulations for practices, methods, and 
procedures the Administrator finds 
necessary for safety in air commerce. 
This regulation is within the scope of 
that authority because it addresses an 
unsafe condition that is likely to exist or 
develop on products identified in this 
rulemaking action. 
Regulatory Findings 
The FAA determined that this 
proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 
13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the 
States, on the relationship between the 
national Government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
For the reasons discussed above, I 
certify that the proposed regulation: 
(1) Is not a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ under Executive Order 12866, 
(2) Would not affect intrastate 
aviation in Alaska, and 
(3) Would not have a significant 
economic impact, positive or negative, 
on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. 
List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 
Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation 
safety, Incorporation by reference, 
Safety. 
The Proposed Amendment 
Accordingly, under the authority 
delegated to me by the Administrator, 
the FAA proposes to amend 14 CFR part 
39 as follows: 
PART 39—AIRWORTHINESS 
DIRECTIVES 
1. The authority citation for part 39 
continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701. § 39.13 [Amended] 
2. The FAA amends § 39.13 by: 
a. Removing Airworthiness Directive 
2020–09–15, Amendment 39–19911 (85 
FR 30589, May 20, 2020); and 
b. Adding the following new 
airworthiness directive: 
Airbus Helicopters: Docket No. FAA–2025– 
5389; Project Identifier MCAI–2024– 
00716–R. 
(a) Comments Due Date 
The FAA must receive comments on this 
airworthiness directive (AD) by February 2, 
2026. 
(b) Affected ADs 
This AD replaces AD 2020–09–15, 
Amendment 39–19911 (85 FR 30589, May 20, 
2020). 
(c) Applicability 
This AD applies to Airbus Helicopters 
Model AS332C, AS332C1, AS332L, and 
AS332L1 helicopters, certificated in any 
category, equipped with a dual hoist 
installation and de-icing system. 
(d) Subject 
Joint Aircraft System Component (JASC) 
Code 1810, Helicopter vibration analysis. 
(e) Unsafe Condition 
This AD was prompted by a report of 
vibrations around the 12 Hz frequency due to 
the specific helicopter configuration and 
determination that additional vibration level 
measurements are necessary. The FAA is 
issuing this AD to prevent divergent 
aeromechanic coupling between the 
helicopter structure and rotor. The unsafe 
condition, if not addressed, could result in 
mechanical failure of structural parts and 
consequent loss of control of the helicopter. 
(f) Compliance 
Comply with this AD within the 
compliance times specified, unless already 
done.

Airworthiness Directives; Airbus 
Helicopters 
AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 
SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all 
Airbus Helicopters Model AS355E, AS 
355–F, AS 355–F1, AS355F2, AS355N, 
and AS355NP helicopters. This 
proposed AD was prompted by a report 
of a structural crack in the vertical 
attachment spar of the tail fin. This 
proposed AD would require repetitive 
inspections of certain vertical upper fin 
spars and, depending on the results, 
corrective action. This proposed AD 
would also prohibit installing certain 
upper fin assemblies. The FAA is 
proposing this AD to address the unsafe 
condition on these products. 
DATES: The FAA must receive comments on this NPRM by February 2, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: You may send comments, using the procedures found in 14 CFR 
11.43 and 11.45, by any of the following

Background 
EASA, which is the Technical Agent 
for the Member States of the European 
Union, has issued a series of ADs, the 
most recent being EASA AD 2023– 
0154R1, dated July 19, 2024 (EASA AD 
2023–0154R1) (also referred to as ‘‘the 
MCAI’’), to correct an unsafe condition 
on all Airbus Helicopters Model AS 355 
E, AS 355 F, AS 355 F1, AS355 F2, 
AS355 N, and AS 355 NP helicopters. 
The MCAI advises of a report of a 
structural crack (not a complete failure) 
in the vertical attachment spar of the tail 
fin. 
The MCAI states that the unsafe 
condition, if not addressed, may lead to 
in-flight separation of the upper part of 
the vertical fin, which could result in 
loss of control of the helicopter. The 
FAA is proposing this AD to address the 
unsafe condition on these products. 
EASA has issued related EASA AD 
2024–0139, dated July 12, 2024 (EASA 
AD 2024–0139), for these same model 
helicopters as well as certain Model 
AS350B3 helicopters, to address 
cracking in a different area of the upper 
fin spar as well as the fin’s front 
attachment screws. The FAA issued AD 
2025–24–04, Amendment 39–23199 (90 
FR 56679, December 8, 2025) (AD 2025– 
24–04), to address EASA AD 2024– 
0139. This proposed AD includes 
actions that would be contingent on 
some of the required actions in AD 
2025–24–04. 
You may examine the MCAI in the 
AD docket at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA–2025–5039. 
Material Incorporated by Reference 
Under 1 CFR Part 51 
FAA reviewed EASA AD 2023– 
0154R1, which specifies procedures for 
removing the tail gear box (TGB) fairing 
and the rear fairing from the tail boom, 
cleaning, and inspecting the right-hand 
external side around the two top screws 
of certain upper fin spars for a crack. 
EASA AD 2023–0154R1 also specifies 
procedures for conducting repetitive 
borescope inspections of that upper fin 
spar area for a crack or repeating the 
initial inspection as an alternative. 
Additionally, EASA AD 2023–0154R1 
specifies accomplishing the inspections 
prior to and after maintenance flights 
that exceed the reduced V
NE
(Velocity 
Never Exceed) required by EASA AD 
2024–0139 and after each other flight 
that exceeds the reduced V
NE
required

the results of an inspection, EASA AD 
2023–0154R1 specifies procedures for 
marking the two top right-hand screw 
ends or replacing the upper fin. EASA 
AD 2023–0154R1 further specifies that 
installing an upper fin assembly part 
number (P/N) 355A14–0522–1751 
constitutes terminating action for its 
repetitive inspection requirements and 
prohibits installing certain upper fin 
assemblies on any helicopter. This 
material is reasonably available because 
the interested parties have access to it 
through their normal course of business 
or by the means identified in the 
ADDRESSESsection. 
FAA’s Determination 
These products have been approved 
by the aviation authority of another 
country and are approved for operation 
in the United States. Pursuant to the 
FAA’s bilateral agreement with this 
State of Design Authority, it has notified 
the FAA of the unsafe condition 
described in the MCAI referenced 
above. The FAA is proposing this AD 
after evaluating all known relevant 
information and determining that the 
unsafe condition described previously is 
likely to exist or develop on other 
products of the same type design. 
Proposed AD Requirements in This 
NPRM 
This proposed AD would require 
accomplishing the actions specified in 
EASA AD 2023–0154R1, described 
previously, as incorporated by 
reference, except for any differences 
identified as exceptions in the 
regulatory text of this proposed AD. See 
‘‘Differences Between this AD and the 
MCAI’’ for a discussion of these 
differences. 
Differences Between This Proposed AD 
and the MCAI 
Where the MCAI defines an affected 
part as those listed in any revision of the 
manufacturer’s service information, this 
proposed AD would define an affected 
part as those listed in specific versions 
of the manufacturer’s service 
information and would include upper 
fin assemblies for which the P/N cannot 
be determined. 
Explanation of Required Compliance 
Information 
In the FAA’s ongoing efforts to 
improve the efficiency of the AD 
process, the FAA developed a process to 
use some civil aviation authority (CAA) 
ADs as the primary source of 
information for compliance with 
requirements for corresponding FAA 
ADs. The FAA has been coordinating 
this process with manufacturers and 
CAAs. As a result, the FAA proposes to 
incorporate EASA AD 2023–0154R1 by 
reference in the FAA final rule. This 
proposed AD would, therefore, require 
compliance with EASA AD 2023– 
0154R1 in its entirety through that 
incorporation, except for any differences 
identified as exceptions in the 
regulatory text of this proposed AD. 
Using common terms that are the same 
as the heading of a particular section in 
EASA AD 2023–0154R1 does not mean 
that operators need comply only with 
that section. For example, where the AD 
requirement refers to ‘‘all required 
actions and compliance times,’’ 
compliance with this AD requirement is 
not limited to the section titled 
‘‘Required Action(s) and Compliance 
Time(s)’’ in EASA AD 2023–0154R1. 
Material referenced in EASA AD 2023– 
0154R1 for compliance will be available 
at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA–2025–5039 after the FAA final 
rule is published. 
Costs of Compliance 
The FAA estimates that this AD, if 
adopted as proposed, would affect 177 
helicopters of U.S. registry. Labor rates 
are estimated at $85 per hour. Based on 
these numbers, the FAA estimates the 
following costs to comply with this 
proposed AD. 
Initial cleaning and inspection of the 
vertical fin spar and, if necessary, 
application of a paint mark on the top 
two right-hand screw ends would take 
2.5 work-hours for an estimated cost of 
$213 per helicopter and $37,701 for the 
U.S. fleet. 
Repetitive borescope inspection of the 
upper fin spar would take 0.5 work-hour 
for an estimated cost of $43 per 
helicopter and up to $7,611 for the U.S. 
fleet, per inspection cycle. 
Alternatively, repeating the initial 
inspection would take 2.5 work-hours 
for an estimated cost of $213 per 
helicopter and up to $37,701 for the 
U.S. fleet, per inspection cycle. 
If required, removing the upper fin 
from service and installing upper fin 
assembly P/N 355A14–0522–1751 to 
modify the upper fin would take 40 
work-hours and parts would cost 
$25,360 for an estimated cost of $28,760 
per helicopter. 
The FAA has included all known 
costs in its cost estimate. According to 
the manufacturer, however, some of the 
costs of this proposed AD may be 
covered under warranty, thereby 
reducing the cost impact on affected 
operators. 
Authority for This Rulemaking 
Title 49 of the United States Code 
specifies the FAA’s authority to issue 
rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, 
section 106, describes the authority of 
the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: 
Aviation Programs, describes in more 
detail the scope of the Agency’s 
authority. 
The FAA is issuing this rulemaking 
under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 
44701: General requirements. Under 
that section, Congress charges the FAA 
with promoting safe flight of civil 
aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
regulations for practices, methods, and 
procedures the Administrator finds 
necessary for safety in air commerce. 
This regulation is within the scope of 
that authority because it addresses an 
unsafe condition that is likely to exist or 
develop on products identified in this 
rulemaking action. 
Regulatory Findings 
The FAA determined that this 
proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 
13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the 
States, on the relationship between the 
national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
For the reasons discussed above, I 
certify this proposed regulation: 
(1) Is not a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ under Executive Order 12866, 
(2) Would not affect intrastate 
aviation in Alaska, and 
(3) Would not have a significant 
economic impact, positive or negative, 
on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Authority for This Rulemaking 
The FAA’s authority to issue rules 
regarding aviation safety is found in 
Title 49 of the United States Code. 
Subtitle I, Section 106 describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. 
Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the 
agency’s authority. This rulemaking is 
promulgated under the authority 
described in Subtitle VII, Part A, 
Subpart I, section 40103. Under that 
section, the FAA is charged with 
prescribing regulations to assign the use 
of the airspace necessary to ensure the 
safety of aircraft and the efficient use of 
airspace. This regulation is within the 
scope of that authority as it amends 
restricted area airspace at Fort Drum, 
NY, to enhance aviation safety and 
accommodate essential United States 
(U.S.) Army training activities. 
Comments Invited 
The FAA invites interested persons to 
participate in this rulemaking by 
submitting written comments, data, or 
views. Comments are specifically 
invited on the overall regulatory, 
aeronautical, economic, environmental, 
and energy-related aspects of the 
proposal. The most helpful comments 
reference a specific portion of the 
proposal, explain the reason for any 
recommended change, and include 
supporting data. To ensure the docket 
does not contain duplicate comments, 
commenters should submit only one 
time if comments are filed 
electronically, or commenters should 
send only one copy of written 
comments if comments are filed in 
writing. 
The FAA will file in the docket all 
comments it receives, as well as a report 
summarizing each substantive public 
contact with FAA personnel concerning 
this proposed rulemaking. Before acting 
on this proposal, the FAA will consider 
all comments it receives on or before the 
closing date for comments. The FAA 
will consider comments filed after the 
comment period has closed if it is 
possible to do so without incurring 
expense or delay. The FAA may change 
this proposal in light of the comments 
it receives. 
Privacy: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(c), DOT solicits comments from the 
public to better inform its rulemaking 
process. DOT posts these comments, 
without edit, including any personal 
information the commenter provides, to 
www.regulations.gov, as described in the system of records notice (DOT/ALL– 
14 FDMS), which can be reviewed at 
www.dot.gov/privacy. 
Availability of Rulemaking Documents 
An electronic copy of this document 
may be downloaded through the 
internet at www.regulations.gov. 
Recently published rulemaking 
documents can also be accessed through 
the FAA’s web page at www.faa.gov/air_

You may review the public docket 
containing the proposal, any comments 
received and any final disposition in 
person in the Dockets Office (see 
ADDRESSESsection for address and 
phone number) between 9:00 a.m. and

except Federal holidays. An informal 
docket may also be examined during 
normal business hours at the office of 
the Eastern Service Center, Federal 
Aviation Administration, Room 210, 
1701 Columbia Avenue, College Park, 
GA 30337. 
Background 
The Department of the Army, Fort 
Drum, NY submitted a proposal, in 
concurrence with Boston Air Route 
Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), to the 
FAA to modify the time of designation 
for restricted area R–5201, Fort Drum, 
NY. Restricted area R–5201 has a time 
of designation of ‘‘Continuous April 1 
through September 30 and 0600 through 
1800 hours local time, October 1 
through March 31; other times by 
NOTAM 48 hours in advance.’’ Actual 
usage of restricted area R–5201 over the 
past two years shows near continuous 
activation year-round via issuance of a 
NOTAM. Restricted area R–5201 was 
utilized 356 days in fiscal year (FY) 
2023, and 355 days in FY 2024. This 
action proposes to modify the time of 
designation of restricted area R–5201 to 
‘‘continuous’’ which would alleviate 
any confusion due to constantly issuing 
NOTAMS to activate the restricted area 
airspace and align with actual usage. 
These changes do not represent any 
changes in lateral or vertical boundaries, 
operations, or new equipment being 
utilized in the airspace; nor does it 
reflect any increase in the number of 
operations that would be conducted. 
The Proposal 
The FAA is proposing an amendment 
to 14 CFR part 73 by amending the time 
of designation for restricted area R– 
5201, Fort Drum, NY, to ‘‘continuous’’ 
to align with actual usage and support 
Army training requirements. 
The FAA proposes to update the 
using agency for restricted area R–5201

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS58523 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Proposed Rules from ‘‘Commanding Officer, Fort Drum, 
NY’’ to ‘‘U.S. Army, Commanding 
Officer, Fort Drum, NY.’’ This change 
follows the FAA’s current airspace 
description format guidance. 
Additionally, the FAA proposes to 
make a minor technical amendment by 
adding two geographic coordinates to 
the description of restricted area R– 
5201. Adding these coordinates to the 
description of restricted area R–5201 
does not change the boundaries of the 
restricted area, but rather ensures 
coincident boundary alignment with the 
adjacent restricted areas R–5202A and 
R–5202B. The geographic coordinates 
‘‘lat. 44°0934 N, long. 75°4000 W’’ and ‘‘lat. 44°0600 N , long. 75°2849 W’’ are added to the description of 
restricted area R–5201. 
The full description of the above 
restricted area is set forth below in the 
proposed amendments to part 73. 
Regulatory Notices and Analyses 
The FAA has determined that this 
proposed regulation only involves an 
established body of technical 
regulations for which frequent and 
routine amendments are necessary to 
keep them operationally current. It, 
therefore: (1) is not a ‘‘significant 
regulatory action’’ under Executive 
Order 12866; (2) is not a ‘‘significant 
rule’’ under DOT Regulatory Policies 
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 
26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant 
preparation of a regulatory evaluation as 
the anticipated impact is so minimal. 
Since this is a routine matter that will 
only affect air traffic procedures and air 
navigation, it is certified that this 
proposed rule, when promulgated, will 
not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. 
Environmental Review 
This proposal will be subject to an 
environmental analysis in accordance 
with FAA Order 1050.1G, ‘‘FAA 
National Environmental Policy Act 
Implementing Procedures’’ prior to any 
FAA final regulatory action.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS58524 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Proposed Rules SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) 
part 141 (Pilot Schools) prescribes the 
requirements for issuing pilot school air 
agency certificates, provisional pilot 
school air agency certificates, and 
associated ratings, and the general 
operating rules applicable to a holder of 
a certificate or rating issued under part 
141. Through a part 141 pilot school, a 
student may obtain equivalent levels of 
aeronautical experience in fewer hours 
than required by 14 CFR part 61 
(Certification: Pilots, Flight Instructors, 
and Ground Instructors). Part 141 
schools are required to have FAA 
certification and supplementary 
oversight. Specifically, part 141 
includes curricula standards for training 
and procedures to ensure a training 
course used by a school is adequate, 
appropriate, and administered by 
qualified personnel. 
The process of licensing or 
certification of pilot schools in the 
United States is approaching 100 years 
of existence. Although the FAA has 
revised certain regulatory requirements 
pertaining to pilot schools during this 
time, part 141 still has many 
foundational ties to Civil Air 
Regulations (CAR) part 50, which was 
implemented in the 1940s. Regulations 
for pilot schools are typically 
promulgated to improve safety, reduce 
aircraft accidents, and embrace changes 
such as advances in technology and the 
need for data collection and analysis. 
Modernizing part 141 is essential for 
addressing challenges pertaining to 
certification, certification management, 
examining authority, and evolving 
technology and learning methods. The 
objective of modernizing part 141 is to 
increase safety and create a foundation 
for a more structured and robust 
training environment to aid in the 
reduction of general aviation fatal 
accidents. 
Therefore, part 141 must be analyzed 
to determine how it can evolve with the 
changing aviation industry. Over the 
course of the project, the FAA is seeking 
engagement from the flight training 
industry through participation in public 
meetings. Collaboration is encouraged to 
stimulate the innovation of a modern 
part 141 that will serve the needs of 
current and future pilot schools, as well 
as provide a robust and safe training 
environment that instills the necessary 
knowledge, skills, critical thinking, and 
aeronautical decision making in its 
pilots to create a safer national airspace 
system. 
Public Meetings 
Information concerning the public 
meetings, including topics and meeting 
times will be posted at the following 
website: https://www.faa.gov/about/ office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/ offices/afx/afs/afs800/afs810/

certification and supplementary 
oversight. Specifically, part 141 
includes curricula standards for training 
and procedures to ensure a training 
course used by a school is adequate, 
appropriate, and administered by 
qualified personnel. 
The process of licensing or 
certification of pilot schools in the 
United States is approaching 100 years 
of existence. Although the FAA has 
revised certain regulatory requirements 
pertaining to pilot schools during this 
time, part 141 still has many 
foundational ties to Civil Air 
Regulations (CAR) part 50, which was 
implemented in the 1940s. Regulations 
for pilot schools are typically 
promulgated to improve safety, reduce 
aircraft accidents, and embrace changes 
such as advances in technology and the 
need for data collection and analysis. 
Modernizing part 141 is essential for 
addressing challenges pertaining to 
certification, certification management, 
examining authority, and evolving 
technology and learning methods. The 
objective of modernizing part 141 is to 
increase safety and create a foundation 
for a more structured and robust 
training environment to aid in the 
reduction of general aviation fatal 
accidents. 
Therefore, part 141 must be analyzed 
to determine how it can evolve with the 
changing aviation industry. Over the 
course of the project, the FAA is seeking 
engagement from the flight training 
industry through participation in public 
meetings. Collaboration is encouraged to 
stimulate the innovation of a modern 
part 141 that will serve the needs of 
current and future pilot schools, as well 
as provide a robust and safe training 
environment that instills the necessary 
knowledge, skills, critical thinking, and 
aeronautical decision making in its 
pilots to create a safer national airspace 
system.

I. Introduction 
A. The Petition 
CME and FICC (‘‘Petitioners’’) have 
petitioned the Commission to grant an 
exemptive order pursuant to section 4(c) 
of the CEA. The exemptive order would 
provide relief necessary for Petitioners 
to make their existing cross-margining 
arrangement available to certain 
customers, as described below.
2
 
The Commission is proposing to issue 
an order granting Petitioners the relief 
sought, subject to certain conditions 
discussed below (the ‘‘Proposed 
Order’’). 
B. Background 
On January 16, 2024, the SEC 
promulgated a rule that, when effective, 
will mandate the central clearing of 
most U.S. Treasury cash and repurchase 
transactions (‘‘Treasury Clearing 
Requirement’’).
3
The Treasury Clearing 
Requirement is designed to reduce risk 
and increase operational efficiency by 
requiring clearing of specified U.S. 
Treasury security transactions through a 
central counterparty. Centralized 
clearing reduces the risk of default by 
imposing a central counterparty 
between buyers and sellers. A central 
counterparty can lower the potential for 
a single market participant’s failure to 
destabilize other market participants or 
the financial system more broadly by 
substituting its own creditworthiness 
and liquidity for the creditworthiness 
and liquidity of the initial 
counterparties.
4
 
Currently, only one central 
counterparty, FICC, provides centralized 
clearing services for cash market 
transactions in U.S. Treasury securities, 
and for repurchase and reverse purchase 
transactions involving U.S. Treasury 
securities. FICC is registered as a 
clearing agency with the SEC under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Exchange Act’’)
5
and is subject to 
regulation under section 17A of the 
Exchange Act, SEC Rule 17ad–22 (as a 
‘‘covered clearing agency’’),
6
and other 
SEC rules. FICC is designated by the 
Financial Stability Oversight Council 
(‘‘FSOC’’) as a systemically important 
financial market utility (‘‘SIFMU’’).
7
 
Increasing clearing efficiency will 
decrease the cost to market participants 
of the Treasury Clearing Requirement. 
One way to increase clearing efficiency 
is through cross-margining 
arrangements that allow for cross- 
margining of U.S. Treasury security 
positions with positions in related 
products with correlated price risks 
held at another clearing organization. 
Cross-margining arrangements allow 
joint members or affiliated members of 
two clearing organizations to have their 
initial margin requirements reduced by 
accounting for risk offsets between 
positions held at each of the clearing 
organizations.

Section 4(c) of the CEA provides that the 
Commission may provide an exemption ‘‘on its own 
initiative or on application of any person,’’ so 
parties receiving exemptive relief are not limited to 
those who directly petition the Commission. 7 
U.S.C. 6(c). 
Petitioners have an existing cross- 
margining arrangement.
9
CME clears a 
variety of U.S. Treasury futures 
contracts and other interest rate futures 
contracts that have price risks that are 
correlated with U.S. Treasury security 
products cleared at FICC. CME is 
registered as a derivatives clearing 
organization (‘‘DCO’’) with the 
Commission and is subject to regulation 
under the Commodity Exchange Act 
(‘‘CEA’’)
10
and Commission regulations. 
As a DCO, CME clears transactions in 
futures contracts and options on futures 
contracts listed for trading on the CME 
Group exchanges (and transactions in 
other types of derivatives). CME is also 
designated by the FSOC as a SIFMU. 
The current cross-margining 
arrangement between the Petitioners is 
offered to their joint clearing members 
and pairs of affiliated clearing members 
for proprietary (non-customer) 
positions. The cross-margining 
arrangement permits a participating 
joint clearing member or pair of 
affiliated clearing members to have 
initial margin requirements at FICC and 
CME reduced in response to risk offsets 
across positions in futures on U.S. 
Treasury securities and other interest 
rate futures cleared at CME and eligible 
Treasury market transactions cleared at 
FICC. The arrangement has been 
approved by the Commission and the 
SEC.
11
Under the cross-margining 
arrangement, eligible positions of a 
participating clearing member are 
identified and treated as a combined 
portfolio for margin calculation 
purposes. Both FICC and CME use their 
own margin models to calculate initial 
margin requirements for the combined 
portfolio, then use the more 
conservative result to determine the 
margin savings percentage to be applied 
to the portfolio. Each of FICC and CME 
then requires the participating clearing 
member to post initial margin in an 
amount calculated using its 
independent margin model reduced by 
that margin savings percentage. 
This current cross-margining 
arrangement is only available for the 
proprietary positions of clearing 
members, and not for the positions of 
customers who clear through an 
intermediary. Excluding customer 
positions may increase the costs of 
central clearing for customers clearing 
both Treasury securities transactions 
and certain Treasury and interest rate 
futures, by setting margin requirements 
that do not account for the risk offsets 
of their combined portfolio and are thus 
higher than those of clearing members 
who have access to cross-margining. 
Industry experts have called for 
expanded access to cross-margining. 
The CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory 
Committee (‘‘GMAC’’) recommended 
that the Commission allow CME and 
FICC to make the benefits of cross- 
margining available to a broad range of 
customers, including customers subject 
to the new Treasury Clearing 
Requirement. The GMAC’s 
recommendation covered specific topics 
such as structure, customer protection, 
and implementation.
12
The Group of 
Thirty Working Group on Treasury 
Market Liquidity also highlighted the 
need for expansion of cross-margining 
to the customer level. In their report 
related to Treasury market resilience, 
they suggested a review be conducted to 
‘‘examine impediments to the use of the 
cross-margining service that FICC and 
[CME] have had in place since 2004’’ 
and further opined that ‘‘[w]ider use of 
cross-margining would reduce the risk 
that increases in initial margin 
requirements on the futures leg of cash- 
futures basis trades result in forced sales 
of Treasury securities ....’’
13
 
Accordingly, CME and FICC seek to 
expand their existing cross-margining 
program to make it available to certain 
customers. Specifically, the cross- 
margining program would be available 
to customers of joint clearing members 
of FICC and CME that are BD–FCMs. 
The cross-margined positions and 
associated margin would be carried in a 
futures customer account on the books 
and records of an eligible BD–FCM and 
generally subject to the regulations and 
protections of the CEA and Commission 
regulations, including CEA section 4d 
and the Commission’s regulations for 
segregation and protection of futures 
customer funds. 
This cross-margining expansion to 
customers, however, would conflict 
with applicable legal requirements. 
Section 4d of the CEA requires that 
futures customer funds be segregated 
and prohibits the commingling of 
futures customer funds and futures 
customer positions with any other 
positions and funds. However, section 
4d further provides that, ‘‘in accordance 
with such terms and conditions as the 
Commission may prescribe by rule, 
regulation, or order,’’ futures customer 
funds may be commingled with other 
customer funds.
14
The contemplated 
cross-margining arrangement would 
require that BD–FCMs hold securities 
positions and associated funds in their 
futures customer accounts. 
In addition, section 4d requires that 
futures customer funds be held with a 
bank or trust company, and section 
5b(c)(2)(F) of the CEA requires, in part, 
that a DCO hold member and 
participant funds in a manner by which 
to minimize the risk of loss or of delay 
in the access by the DCO to the assets 
and funds. Commission Regulations 
1.20 and 1.49(d) implement these 
statutory requirements in part by 
limiting the depositories that may hold 
futures customer funds to a bank or trust 
company, an FCM, or a DCO. In the 
contemplated cross-margining 
arrangement, futures customer funds 
would be held by FICC, a clearing 
organization that is not a DCO, and is 
not a permitted depository for futures 
customer funds. 
Petitioners have consequently 
petitioned the Commission to grant an 
exemptive order pursuant to section 4(c) 
of the CEA to provide relief necessary 
for them to make their customer cross- 
margining arrangement available to 
certain customers. Specifically, 
Petitioners seek exemptive relief to: 
€Permit BD–FCMs15
to deposit at 
FICC, and permit FICC to hold, 
customer funds and margin associated 
with futures positions, notwithstanding 
that FICC is not a permitted depository 
under section 4d of the CEA and 
Commission Regulations 1.20 and 
1.49(d), and to permit CME to treat FICC 
as a permissible location to hold 
customer funds and margin even though 
FICC is not a permitted depository

Commission Regulation 1.3, of the BD– 
FCM, securities positions and associated 
funds together with the futures 
customer positions and funds held by 
the BD–FCM. 
II. Section 4(c) of the CEA 
Section 4(c)(1) of the CEA empowers 
the Commission to ‘‘promote 
responsible economic or financial 
innovation and fair competition’’ by 
exempting any transaction or class of 
transactions (including any person or 
class of persons offering, entering into, 
rendering advice or rendering other 
services with respect to, the agreement, 
contract, or transaction), from any of the 
provisions of the CEA, subject to 
exceptions not relevant here.
16
In 
enacting section 4(c), Congress noted 
that its goal ‘‘is to give the Commission 
a means of providing certainty and 
stability to existing and emerging 
markets so that financial innovation and 
market development can proceed in an 
effective and competitive manner.’’
17
 
The Commission may grant such an 
exemption by rule, regulation, or order, 
after notice and opportunity for hearing, 
and may do so on application of any 
person or on its own initiative. 
Section 4(c)(2) of the CEA provides 
that the Commission may grant 
exemptions to section 4(a) under section 
4(c)(1) only when it determines that the 
requirements for which an exemption is 
being provided should not be applied to 
the agreements, contracts, or 
transactions at issue; that the exemption 
is consistent with the public interest 
and the purposes of the CEA; that the 
agreements, contracts, or transactions 
will be entered into solely between 
appropriate persons; and that the 
exemption will not have a material 
adverse effect on the ability of the 
Commission or any contract market or 
derivatives transaction execution 
facility to discharge its regulatory or 
self-regulatory responsibilities under the 
CEA.
18
 
The Commission preliminarily 
believes that issuing the Proposed Order 
which grants the exemption sought by 
Petitioners is in the public interest and 
would promote responsible economic 
and financial innovation and fair 
competition. While not concluding 
section 4(c)(2) applies to the proposed 
order, the Commission also 
preliminarily believes that the proposed 
order would meet the standards in 
section 4(c)(2) of the CEA. The 
discussion below describes why the 
Commission has reached this 
preliminary conclusion. 
III. Segregation of Customer Funds 
The protection of customers—and the 
safeguarding of money, securities, or 
other property deposited by 
customers—is a fundamental 
component of the regulatory and 
oversight framework of the futures and 
swaps markets. Section 4d(a)(2) of the 
CEA requires an FCM to segregate from 
its own assets all money, securities, and 
other property deposited by futures or 
cleared swaps customers to margin, 
secure, or guarantee their futures, 
options on futures, or cleared swaps 
positions. Section 4d(a)(2) further 
requires an FCM to treat customer funds 
as belonging to the customer and 
prohibits an FCM from using the funds 
deposited by a customer to margin or 
extend credit to any person other than 
the customer that deposited the funds. 
Similarly, section 4d(b) of the CEA 
prohibits a DCO and any depository that 
has received such funds from holding, 
disposing of, or using such funds as 
belonging to the depositing FCM or any 
person other than the customers of such 
FCM. Customer segregation is an 
essential protection to ensure funds are 
held exclusively as the property of 
customers, even during an FCM 
insolvency. 
CEA section 4d(a)(2) prohibits 
commingling futures customer positions 
executed on a contract market, and 
futures customer funds supporting such 
positions, with any property not 
required to be so segregated. 
Commingling of futures customer funds 
with other funds may take place only in 
accordance with such terms as the 
Commission may provide by rule, 
regulation, or order. Further, 
Commission Regulation 1.20 requires 
FCMs and DCOs to separately account 
for all futures customer funds and 
segregate such funds as belonging to 
futures customers, and it requires FCMs 
and DCOs to deposit futures customer 
funds in a manner that identifies them 
as futures customer funds. 
A. Commingling 
The customer cross-margining 
arrangement under the Proposed Order 
would allow a BD–FCM to commingle 
cross-margined securities positions and 
associated margin with cross-margined 
futures positions and associated margin. 
Permitting this commingling would 
allow for provision of risk offsets for 
customer positions in futures and 
securities cleared at CME and FICC 
through BD–FCMs. 
CME and FICC detail in their petition 
the structure of the arrangement they 
would implement under the Proposed 
Order and the way it is designed to 
protect customer funds. At a high level, 
a customer wishing to cross-margin its 
futures positions cleared at CME with 
its securities positions cleared at FICC 
would elect to have its FICC-cleared 
U.S. Treasury securities positions and 
associated funds held in a commingled 
futures account at the BD–FCM, to 
facilitate margining all of the positions 
as a portfolio. The BD–FCM would post 
funds to support cross-margined futures 
positions with CME and funds to 
support cross-margined securities 
positions with FICC. FICC would record 
cross-margined securities positions and 
associated funds (‘‘XM Securities 
Customer Property’’) in accounts on 
FICC’s books and records, the margin 
being recorded on FICC’s books and 
records in margin accounts in the name 
of the BD–FCM for the benefit of its 
cross-margining customers (‘‘FICC XM 
Customer Margin Accounts’’). FICC 
would hold the margin in either a 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
(‘‘FRBNY’’) account (the ‘‘FICC FRBNY 
Segregated Account’’) or at a 
commercial bank that is insured by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(a ‘‘FICC Segregated Bank Account’’). 
More specifically, the Proposed Order 
would permit, subject to relevant terms 
and conditions, the following structure: 
1. The BD–FCM would be required to 
carry all of a cross-margining customer’s 
positions and associated margin, 
including XM Securities Customer 
Property held at FICC, in a futures 
account as defined in Commission 
Regulation 1.3, subject to CEA section 
4d(a) and related Commission 
regulations as modified by the Proposed 
Order. This would apply to both 
required collateral and any excess 
collateral. 
2. The cross-margining customer 
would be required to: (a) agree to have 
its XM Securities Customer Property 
carried in a futures account; and (b) 
enter into a subordination agreement 
pursuant to which it would agree that 
its claim for the return of XM Securities 
Customer Property will not receive 
customer treatment under the Exchange 
Act or the Securities Investor Protection 
Act of 1970 (‘‘SIPA’’)
19
and that such 
property will not be treated as 
‘‘customer property’’ as defined in 
section 741, subchapter III (stock broker 
liquidation) of chapter 7 of the U.S.

The CFTC has recognized important benefits to 
a clearing organization of using Federal Reserve 
bank accounts. See 81 FR 53467, 53468 (noting the lower credit and liquidity risks with a deposit at a 
Federal Reserve Bank than a deposit at a 
commercial bank). As a SIFMU, FICC is permitted 
to have an account at a Federal Reserve Bank, 
subject to requirements of the Federal Reserve, 
particularly 12 CFR 234.5. FICC has an existing 
FRBNY bank account currently used to maintain 
securities customer collateral that is not associated 
with cross-margining (‘‘Treasury Securities 
Segregated Margin’’). 
FICC represents it is unable to obtain another 
separate Federal Reserve account to hold cross- 
margining customer collateral. In order to hold 
cross-margining customer collateral in an account at 
a Federal Reserve Bank, FICC will need to, if 
permitted to do so, co-locate securities customer 
collateral and cross-margining customer collateral 
in the same FRBNY bank account to deposit both 
types of collateral in a Federal Reserve Bank. As 
discussed further below in section III.C, because 
FICC is not a registered DCO, and thus a FICC 
bankruptcy would not be governed by subchapter 
IV of chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 
761 et. seq., the implications of such co-location of customer collateral are different than if FICC were 
a registered DCO. 
In connection with the customer cross-margining 
framework under the Proposed Order, FICC would 
(if permitted by the Federal Reserve to hold cash 
cross-margining customer collateral in the FRBNY 
Segregated Account) amend its rules to provide that 
the FICC FRBNY Segregated Account may hold 
cash cross-margining customer margin in addition 
to (SEC regulated) segregated customer margin (but 
no other assets) and the FRBNY account notice 
would be amended to specify that the cash in the 
FICC FRBNY Segregated Account is also held 
pursuant to the Proposed Order and the 
corresponding related SEC order. Otherwise, FICC 
will hold such cash cross-margining customer 
collateral in a Segregated Bank Account that would 
only hold cross-margining customer collateral and 
would be at a commercial bank. 
21
Funds held in the FICC FRBNY Segregated 
Account will be held subject to the exception for 
FICC Treasury Securities Segregated Margin 
discussed in footnote 14 above. 
22
Pursuant to section 19(b) of the Securities 
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78s(b), a self-regulatory 
organization such as FICC must submit any 
proposed change in its rules to the SEC for 
approval. The Proposed Order requires FICC to, 
consistent with section 19(b), amend its rulebook as 
necessary to implement the undertakings set forth 
in the petition. Thus, the relief set forth in the 
Proposed Order can only become effective if FICC 
proposes, and the SEC approves, such amendments 
to the FICC rulebook. 
23
All quoted terms in this paragraph refer to such 
terms as defined in Article 8 of the New York 
Uniform Commercial Code (‘‘NYUCC’’). 
24
As a technical matter, an insolvency of a 
broker-dealer (including a BD–FCM) that has 
customers that are neither insiders nor a broker- 
dealer or bank that is not trading on behalf of 
customers that are themselves neither a broker- 
dealer or a bank, would proceed under the 
Securities Investors Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. 78aaa 
et. seq. (‘‘SIPA’’). See id. sections 5(a)(3), 9(a), 15 U.S.C. 78eee(a)(3), 78fff–3(a). However, a trustee 
under SIPA is subject to the same duties as a trustee 
under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, including 
(in the case of a BD–FCM), subchapter IV of chapter 
7, the commodity broker liquidation provisions. 
SIPA section 7(b), 15 U.S.C. 78fff–1(b). Accordingly, 
such a proceeding is referred to herein as a ‘‘BD– 
FCM bankruptcy.’’ 
25
Commission Regulation 190.09(a)(1)(i)(A). 
Bankruptcy Code in a liquidation of the 
BD–FCM. 
3. FICC would record a cross- 
margining customer’s cross-margined 
securities positions in an account on its 
books and records for recording a BD– 
FCM’s cross-margining customers’ 
transactions (‘‘FICC XM Customer 
Position Account’’). 
4. FICC would credit margin it 
collects from a BD–FCM for the BD– 
FCM’s cross-margining customers to an 
account on its books and records in the 
name of the BD–FCM for the benefit of 
its customers (‘‘FICC XM Customer 
Margin Account’’). FICC would hold all 
funds credited to the FICC XM 
Customer Margin Accounts either in: (a) 
the FICC FRBNY Segregated Account; 
20
 
or (b) a FICC Segregated Bank Account, 
each of which would be opened in the 
name of FICC and clearly labeled, and 
for accounts at a commercial bank, 
acknowledged as held for the benefit of 
cross-margining customers. 
5. FICC’s accounts referred to in A.4 
above would be separate accounts from 
the accounts holding (a) FICC’s own 
assets, (b) margin for the BD–FCM’s 
proprietary positions, and (c) except as 
discussed in footnote 19 above, margin 
for positions of the BD–FCM’s 
customers that do not participate in 
cross-margining. Although FICC itself is 
not a registered DCO and is not a 
permitted depository under Commission 
Regulation 1.49(d), as discussed in more 
detail below, FICC would hold cross- 
margining customer margin (‘‘XM 
Customer Margin’’) consistently with all 
requirements under Commission 
Regulations 1.20 and 1.49 as applicable 
to DCOs
21
as well as with the 
requirements of Commission 
Regulations 39.15(b)(1) and (c) and 
39.36(g). 
6. FICC would amend its rules
22
so 
that: (a) all assets credited to the FICC 
XM Customer Margin Accounts will be 
treated as ‘‘financial assets’’
23
credited 
to a ‘‘securities account;’’ (b) FICC will 
be a ‘‘securities intermediary’’ for that 
margin account and each BD–FCM, 
acting on behalf of its customers, will be 
an ‘‘entitlement holder’’ and have a 
‘‘security entitlement’’ with respect to 
assets it deposits in such margin 
account; (c) the FICC XM Customer 
Margin Accounts and the account(s) 
holding Treasury Securities Segregated 
Margin discussed in footnote 19 above 
will be the only types of securities 
accounts, as that term is defined in 
section 8–501(a) of the NYUCC, that 
FICC maintains, and FICC will not 
establish any additional such securities 
accounts without obtaining the 
permission of both the CFTC and the 
SEC. 
7. CME would continue to hold 
margin posted to CME as required by 
CEA section 4d and Commission 
Regulations 1.20, 1.49, 39.15(b)(1) and 
(c), and 39.36(g) in the same manner as 
it treats all other futures customer 
margin. 
B. Protection for the Margin of Cross- 
Margining Participants in the Event of a 
BD–FCM Bankruptcy
24
 
The cross-margining framework under 
the Proposed Order would seek to 
protect cross-margined customer funds 
in the event of the bankruptcy of a 
participating BD–FCM. Participating 
customers’ funds would be protected by 
ensuring that claims for cross-margined 
positions and related collateral are 
treated as customer claims under 
subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code and Part 190 of the 
Commission’s regulations (‘‘Part 190’’) 
regarding bankruptcy. For the reasons 
discussed below, the Commission 
preliminarily concludes that the cross- 
margining customers would thus have 
the same priority right to receive 
distribution on their allowed claims 
against the customer property as other 
customers of the insolvent BD–FCM in 
the futures account class. 
Futures customers of each 
participating BD–FCM are protected as 
a group by ensuring, consistent with the 
Proposed Order, that commingled 
customer funds, including those held by 
FICC, are treated as ‘‘customer 
property’’ held by the BD–FCM in its 
capacity as an FCM, thus supporting the 
goal that all claims for customer 
property are paid in full. 
1. FICC-Held Customer Property as 
Futures Customer Property Under Part 
190 
Three points support the treatment of 
FICC-held customer property as futures 
customer property under part 190. First, 
part 190 includes within the scope of 
customer property any property held by 
or for the account of the debtor, from or 
for the account of a customer, including 
property received, acquired, or held to 
margin, guarantee, secure, purchase or 
sell a commodity contract.
25
As 
discussed above, and required by the 
Proposed Order, FICC will credit margin 
it collects in connection with a cross- 
margining customer’s positions to a 
FICC XM Customer Margin Account in 
the name of the BD–FCM for the benefit 
of its cross-margining customers, which 
are futures customers. Similarly, FICC 
would record a cross-margining 
customer’s positions in a FICC XM 
Customer Position Account, which 
would be an account of the BD–FCM 
that is established for the purpose of 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:12 Dec 16, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\17DEP1.SGM 17DEP1

Also, as required by the Proposed Order, a BD– 
FCM would be required to pledge its interest in the 
XM Securities Customer Property to CME to secure 
the obligations of the BD–FCM with respect to the 
customer’s futures positions cleared by CME. The 
BD–FCM would likewise require each cross- 
margining customer to pledge XM Securities 
Customer Property to the BD–FCM to collateralize 
the cross-margining customer’s obligations arising 
under its CME-cleared customer positions. 
Accordingly, this provides further basis for the XM 
Securities Customer Property to constitute customer 
property on account of being ‘‘property received, 
acquired, or held to margin, guarantee, secure, 
purchase or sell a commodity contract.’’

recording the transactions of cross- 
margining customers. The BD–FCM will 
also record on its books and records the 
XM Securities Customer Property as 
being held in the BD–FCM’s futures 
customer account, and such property 
will be intended to serve as collateral 
for futures positions. 
Moreover, pursuant to section 7 of the 
FICC–CME XM Agreement 
(‘‘Agreement’’), if the BD–FCM defaults, 
and its cross-margined customer 
positions at both CME and FICC are 
liquidated, under circumstances where 
CME is ‘‘worse-off’’ (as such term is 
defined in the Agreement) than FICC, 
some or all of the margin at FICC will 
be payable to CME. Thus, the collateral 
in a FICC XM Customer Margin Account 
in fact is held by or for the account of 
the BD–FCM, from or for the account of 
the BD–FCM’s cross-margining 
customers as property received, 
acquired, or held to margin, guarantee, 
secure, purchase or sell the commodity 
contracts in the BD–FCM’s cross- 
margining customer accounts at CME.
26
 
For these reasons, the Commission 
preliminarily concludes that, because of 
this structure, the XM Securities 
Customer Property would be 
appropriately viewed as customer 
property pursuant to Commission 
Regulation 190.09(a)(1)(i)(A). 
Second, pursuant to paragraph (2)(ii) 
of part 190’s definition of ‘‘account 
class,’’ the securities positions and 
associated collateral held in a BD– 
FCM’s futures account pursuant to this 
(presumptively Commission-approved) 
cross-margining program will be treated 
as being held in the futures account 
class.
27
Moreover, the XM Securities 
Customer Property would also 
constitute ‘‘customer property’’ under 
part 190 to the extent it consists of 
securities held in a portfolio margining 
account carried as a futures account.
28
 
Third, XM Securities Customer 
Property held at FICC would also 
qualify as ‘‘customer property’’ under 
part 190 by virtue of being cash, 
securities, or other property that would 
be segregated for customers on the filing 
date.
29
As described above, FICC would 
credit margin posted for cross-margining 
customers’ positions to a FICC XM 
Customer Margin Account on its books 
and records. This account would hold 
exclusively margin for cross-margining 
customers, and (as noted above) would 
also serve as collateral for associated 
futures positions at CME. XM Customer 
Margin would also be segregated in 
terms of its custody. Lastly, the BD– 
FCM would be required, consistent with 
Commission Regulation 1.20, to 
separately account for all cross- 
margining customers’ margin and 
positions. As a result of this consistent 
segregation, the Commission 
preliminarily concludes that XM 
Securities Customer Property would be 
appropriately considered segregated for 
customers on the filing date and 
therefore ‘‘customer property’’ under 
part 190. 
2. Customer Claims for the FICC-Held 
Customer Positions and Margin at FICC 
as Allowable Claims Under Part 190 
Property is allocated in bankruptcy to 
the customers of a bankrupt FCM based 
on account and customer class and 
based on net equity claims.
30
For the 
reasons discussed below, the 
Commission preliminarily concludes 
that a cross-margining customer’s claims 
for XM Securities Customer Property 
would be allowable claims under part 
190 against customer property in the 
futures account class because they 
would be within the scope of the ‘‘net 
equity’’ definition of the Bankruptcy 
Code, and also because they would be 
incorporated into step 1 of the ‘‘net 
equity’’ calculation set out in 
Commission Regulation 190.08(b). 
A customer’s ‘‘net equity’’ is defined 
in the Bankruptcy Code to include the 
balance remaining in such customer’s 
accounts immediately after the transfer, 
liquidation, or identification for 
delivery of the customer’s positions and 
offset of the customer’s obligations.
31
 
Under the cross-margining framework 
permitted by the Proposed Order, the 
BD–FCM would be required to credit 
XM Securities Customer Property to a 
futures customer account within the 
meaning of Commission Regulation 1.3. 
Accordingly, the Commission 
preliminarily concludes that 
independent of part 190 of the 
Commission’s regulations, such 
amounts would give rise to cross- 
margining customer net equity claims 
under section 761(17) of the Bankruptcy 
Code, since such amounts would 
constitute part of the balance remaining 
in such customers’ accounts. 
In addition, the definition of ‘‘net 
equity’’ in section 761(17) of the 
Bankruptcy Code states that it is subject 
to such rules and regulations as the 
Commission promulgates under the 
CEA. Moreover, section 20(a)(5) of the 
CEA
32
provides that, notwithstanding 
the Bankruptcy Code, the Commission 
may provide, with respect to a 
commodity broker that is a debtor under 
chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, by 
rule or regulation, how the net equity of 
a customer is to be determined. 
Commission Regulation 190.08 
prescribes a five-step process for 
calculating a customer’s net equity 
based on the customer property, 
including any commodity contracts, 
held by the debtor for or on behalf of 
such customer less any indebtedness of 
the customer to the debtor. The first step 
of that process, set out in Commission 
Regulation 190.08(b)(1), requires 
consideration of the sum of: the ledger 
balance; the open trade balance; and the 
realizable market value, determined as 
of the close of the market on the last 
preceding market day, of any securities 
or other property held by or for the 
debtor from or for such account, plus 
accrued interest, if any. 
The ‘‘ledger balance’’ is calculated by 
(A) adding, among other things, (1) cash 
deposited to purchase, margin, 
guarantee, secure, or settle a commodity 
contract, (2) cash proceeds of 
liquidations of any securities or other 
property held by or for the debtor from 
or for the futures account plus accrued 
interest, and (3) gains realized on trades; 
and (B) subtracting, among other things, 
losses realized on trades.
33
The ‘‘open 
trade balance’’ is calculated by 
subtracting the unrealized loss in value 
of the open commodity contracts held 
by or for the customer’s futures account 
from the unrealized gain in value of the 
open commodity contracts held by or 
for such account.
34
 
For purposes of these calculations, 
securities positions and associated 
collateral held in a futures account 
pursuant to a Commission-approved 
cross-margining program are treated as 
customer property held in a futures 
account class.
35
Accordingly, under part 
190, cross-margining customers’ claims 
with respect to cash margin held at FICC 
would form part of the ledger balance 
because they are for cash deposited to 
margin and secure commodity

15 U.S.C. 78s(b). 
45
FICC Rule 4, section 1a, currently provides in 
relevant part that ‘‘[a]ll assets credited to each 
Segregated Customer Margin Custody Account shall 
be treated as ‘financial assets’ within the meaning 
of Article 8 of the NYUCC.’’ The Commission 
preliminarily concludes that this would include 
both securities and cash—while securities are 
included within the term ‘‘financial assets’’ by 
statute, NYUCC 8–102(9)(a)(i), that term also 
includes any property that is held by a securities 
intermediary for another person in a securities 
account ‘‘if the securities intermediary has 
expressly agreed with the other person that the 
property is to be treated as a financial asset under 
this Article.’’ 
46
The Commission preliminarily concludes that 
treatment of the FICC XM Customer Margin 
Account as a ‘‘securities account’’ under the 
NYUCC does not depend on, nor affect, the 
treatment of such account as a futures account for 
purposes of the proposed customer cross-margining 
framework. See NYUCC 8–101, legislative intent (‘‘Except as otherwise expressly provided in this 
act, the provisions of this act are not intended to 
change or to control the definitions of the terms 
‘security’ and ‘commodity’ contained in any other 
laws[.]’’); 8–501, cmt 1 (‘‘A securities account is a 
consensual arrangement in which the intermediary 
undertakes to treat the customer as entitled to 
exercise the rights that comprise the financial asset’’ 
and ‘‘[t]he effect of concluding that an arrangement 
is a securities account is that the rules of [the 
NYUCC] apply.’’). 
47
See NYUCC 8–501(b)(1) and (2). contracts,
36
while the securities margin 
and in-the-money securities positions 
would be property held by the insolvent 
BD–FCM for the cross-margining 
customers’ futures account. The cross- 
margining customers’ securities 
positions could also be viewed as part 
of the open trade balance because they 
would be securities positions held in a 
futures account pursuant to a 
Commission-approved cross-margining 
program. To the extent open securities 
transactions were liquidated or 
otherwise resulted in realized gains, 
those amounts would form part of the 
ledger balance. Therefore, under both 
section 761 of the Bankruptcy Code and 
Part 190, cross-margining customers 
would have allowable net equity claims 
for XM Securities Customer Property 
and the Commission preliminarily 
concludes that they would receive 
adequate protection in bankruptcy. 
3. FICC Would Make Customer 
Positions Portable 
Commission Regulation 190.07(a) 
provides, inter alia, that a DCO may not have rules that interfere with the 
acceptance by its clearing members of 
transfers of commodity contracts, and 
the property margining or securing such 
contracts, from an FCM that is a debtor, 
if such transfers have been approved by 
the Commission, subject to certain 
provisos. FICC intends to amend its 
current rules to expressly allow the 
porting of cleared positions and 
associated margin at FICC in the event 
a clearing member becomes insolvent.
37
 
Pursuant to section (e)(viii) of the 
Proposed Order, FICC would be 
required to amend its rules to provide 
that, as required under Commission 
Regulation 190.07(a), FICC would not 
interfere with transfers of XM Securities 
Customer Property that are approved by 
the Commission pursuant to part 190 
(subject to FICC’s right to liquidate 
positions and manage risk). 
C. Protection for the Collateral Posted by 
Cross-Margining Customers in the Event 
of a FICC Bankruptcy or a Proceeding 
Under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act 
FCM customer funds that are held at 
a registered DCO, such as CME, would 
be protected in the unlikely event of the 
bankruptcy of that DCO under 
subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code, pertaining to 
commodity brokers.
38
The term 
‘‘commodity broker’’ includes both 
FCMs and DCOs.
39
Subchapter IV, and 
the Commission’s part 190 regulations 
implementing those statutory 
provisions, provide a reticulated and 
comprehensive set of protections for 
customer funds in the context of futures 
accounts, cleared swaps accounts, and 
foreign futures accounts, each of which 
falls under an account class. However, 
FICC is not a DCO, and so customer 
funds held at FICC would not be 
protected under subchapter IV in the 
event of FICC’s bankruptcy. Nor are 
funds held at FICC protected under the 
Securities Investor Protection Act
40
or 
subchapter III of chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code,
41
both of which apply 
only to broker-dealers, and not to 
securities clearing agencies. 
For the reasons discussed below, the 
Commission preliminarily concludes 
that cross-margining customers’ margin 
held at FICC would nonetheless be 
protected and not available to creditors 
in the unlikely event of a FICC 
bankruptcy, except for margining or 
settling eligible customer positions, and 
would not form part of FICC’s estate. 
This protection would be 
implemented using NYUCC
42
Article 8, 
as applied to FICC’s rulebook as it 
would be amended. Specifically, the 
Proposed Order would require FICC to 
take steps that the Commission 
preliminarily concludes would ensure 
that participating BD–FCMs, on behalf 
of their customers, would be 
‘‘entitlement holders’’ within the 
meaning of Article 8, with respect to all 
components of the cross-margining 
margin. Moreover, the only other 
entitlement holders would be BD–FCM 
members of FICC with respect to (non- 
cross-margined) segregated customer 
margin deposited by a BD–FCM (on 
behalf of securities customers). As 
explained further below, entitlement 
holders with respect to a particular type 
(e.g., issue) of financial asset have priority claims with respect to all 
interests in that financial asset held by 
FICC. 
As an SEC-registered clearing agency, 
FICC is a ‘‘clearing corporation,’’ and 
thus falls within the definition of a 
‘‘securities intermediary’’ in the 
NYUCC.
43
 
Under the NYUCC, a ‘‘securities 
account’’ means an account to which a 
financial asset is or may be credited in 
accordance with an agreement under 
which the person maintaining the 
account undertakes to treat the person 
for whom the account is maintained as 
entitled to exercise the rights that 
comprise the financial asset. Section 
(e)(v) of the Proposed Order requires 
that FICC shall, consistent with section 
19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act,
44
 
amend FICC’s rules to provide that any 
assets credited to a FICC XM Customer 
Margin Account will be used 
exclusively to settle and margin the 
customer positions and for no other 
purpose. Further, section (e)(iv) requires 
FICC to amend FICC’s rules to provide 
that all assets credited to a FICC XM 
Customer Margin Account would be 
treated as ‘‘financial assets’’
45
credited 
to a ‘‘securities account.’’
46
 
Under the NYUCC, with exceptions 
not relevant here, a person acquires a 
security entitlement if a securities 
intermediary either (1) indicates by 
book entry that a financial asset has 
been credited to the person’s securities 
account, or (2) receives a financial asset 
from the person and accepts it for credit 
to the person’s securities account.
47
A 
person who is either identified in the 
records of a securities intermediary as 
having a security entitlement against the 
securities intermediary, or acquires a 
securities entitlement by virtue of 
section 8–501(b)(2), is an entitlement 
holder. The Commission preliminarily

See NYUCC 8–102. The Bankruptcy Code points to otherwise applicable non-bankruptcy law 
(such as the NYUCC) to determine whether the 
debtor has an interest in an asset such that the asset 
forms part of the debtor’s estate. See, e.g., Butner 
v. U.S., 440 U.S. 48, 54–55 (1979), Collier on Bankruptcy § 541.03. Under Title II of the Dodd- 
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act of 2010, the FDIC as receiver of a covered 
financial company is bound to respect security 
entitlements in a number of relevant ways. See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. 5390 (a)(1)(D) (FDIC resolution subject to 
legally enforceable securities entitlements), (b)(5) 
(‘‘This section shall not affect secured claims or 
security entitlements in respect of assets or property 
held by the covered financial company, except to 
the extent that the security is insufficient to satisfy 
the claim, and then only with regard to the 
difference between the claim and the amount 
realized from the security’’), (c)(12)(B) (security 
entitlements not avoidable). 
As a result, the Commission preliminarily 
concludes that NYUCC 8–503 would ensure that 
margin posted to FICC by BD–FCMs to secure cross- 
margining customer positions would not form part 
of FICC’s estate in a bankruptcy, and the rights of 
the BD–FCM on behalf of its cross-margining 
customers with respect to such margin would not 
be disturbed in a resolution under Title II of Dodd- 
Frank. Petitioners note that Article 8 of the NYUCC 
is also the basis on which the Depository Trust 
Company, banks that hold securities for customers, 
and numerous other custodians depend to ensure 
that securities and other assets they hold for their 
clients will not form part of their respective estates. 
49
The rights of entitlement holders under Article 
8 work differently than the rights of customers of 
an FCM or DCO under subchapter IV. In the latter 
case, the customers have a pro rata interest in 
customer property considered on an omnibus basis. 
By contrast, an entitlement holder’s property 
interest under NYUCC 8–503 is an interest with 
respect to a specific issue of securities or financial 
assets. NYUCC 8–503 comment 1. The Commission 
is preliminarily of the view that, in light of the 
overall structure of the program, this distinction 
does not entail a materially increased degree of risk 
to futures customers. 
50
‘‘Netting Member’’ is used herein as defined in 
FICC’s Government Securities Division Rulebook. A 
Netting Member is a FICC member that is a member 
of FICC’s Comparison System and Netting System. 
51
Petition at 14. 
52
See NYUCC 8–503(b) (‘‘An entitlement holder’s property interest with respect to a particular 
financial asset under subsection (a) is a pro rata 
property interest in all interests in that financial 
asset held by the securities intermediary, without 
regard to the time the entitlement holder acquired 
the security entitlement or the time the securities 
intermediary acquired the interest in that financial 
asset.’’). 
concludes that, in each case, both 
prongs would apply and the BD–FCM, 
acting on behalf of its customers, would 
be the entitlement holder and would 
have a security entitlement with respect 
to the assets credited to the FICC XM 
Customer Margin Account. 
Among the entitlement holder’s rights 
is the right to have financial assets held 
by the securities intermediary returned 
and not be subject to the claims of 
general creditors. Per NYUCC section 8– 
503(a), to the extent necessary for a 
securities intermediary to satisfy all 
security entitlements with respect to a 
particular financial asset, all interests in 
that financial asset held by the 
securities intermediary are held by the 
securities intermediary for the 
entitlement holders, are not property of 
the securities intermediary, and are not 
subject to claims of creditors of the 
securities intermediary, except as 
otherwise provided in section 8–511. 
The relevant exception under NYUCC 
section 8–511(c) for ‘‘a creditor of the 
clearing corporation who has a security 
interest in that financial asset’’ would 
not be inconsistent with this approach, 
since FICC would be required by section 
(e)(vi) of the Proposed Order to amend 
its rules to provide that FICC shall not 
grant a security interest in either XM 
Customer Margin (except with respect to 
CME’s security interest discussed 
below) or FICC Treasury securities 
customer margin. Thus, the Commission 
preliminarily concludes that, under the 
NYUCC, the assets credited to the FICC 
XM Customer Margin Account would 
not form part of FICC’s estate but would 
instead be reserved for BD–FCMs for the 
benefit of their futures customers, 
subject to CME’s security interest as 
discussed in more detail below.
48
 
Because FICC would not use XM 
Customer Margin or Treasury Securities 
Segregated Margin other than for 
purposes of securing or settling cross- 
margining customer cross-margined 
positions or the positions of customers 
that posted segregated customer margin, 
respectively, it is less likely there would 
ever be a shortfall in the particular 
financial assets (here, individual issues 
of Treasury securities or cash) needed to 
satisfy the security entitlements related 
to either type of margin.
49
Moreover, 
FICC has represented that the FICC XM 
Customer Margin Accounts and the 
account(s) holding FICC Treasury 
Securities Segregated Margin will be the 
only types of securities accounts that 
FICC maintains and, as a result, the only 
entitlement holders that FICC would 
have would be Netting Members
50
 
acting on behalf of customers who 
posted XM Customer Margin in relation 
to the FICC XM Customer Margin 
Accounts or Treasury Securities 
Segregated Margin in relation to the 
account(s) holding Treasury Securities 
Segregated Margin.
51
Section (i)(1) of 
the Proposed Order provides that FICC 
shall not establish any additional 
securities accounts without obtaining 
the consent of the Commission and the 
SEC. The Commission preliminarily 
concludes that, under NYUCC section 
8–501, only a person with a securities 
account at a securities intermediary can 
have a security entitlement with respect 
to that intermediary. 
Because the rights of entitlement 
holders are tied to particular issues of 
securities (e.g., CUSIPs) or financial assets (here, pursuant to FICC rules, 
including cash) rather than particular 
accounts, it would appear that if there 
were a shortfall in respect of a particular 
security or cash in either the FICC XM 
Customer Margin Accounts or the 
account(s) holding Treasury Securities 
Segregated Margin, the rights of 
customers who posted XM Customer 
Margin or Treasury Securities 
Segregated Margin would apply to any 
of those particular securities (or cash) 
held by FICC.
52
This would include 
those particular securities (or cash) 
which might otherwise be traceable to 
FICC members that are not entitlement 
holders. This further reduces the 
likelihood of any deficit. 
If, despite the foregoing, any such 
deficit were to arise with respect to a 
particular financial asset, NYUCC 
section 8–503(b) provides for all 
entitlement holders of a securities 
intermediary with respect to that 
particular financial asset to share such 
deficit on a pro rata basis. 
D. Protection for Customers Not 
Participating in Cross-Margining 
The Commission preliminarily 
believes that the cross-margining 
arrangement permitted by the Proposed 
Order does not present unacceptable 
risk to customers not participating in 
cross-margining. The Commission 
preliminarily believes that a variety of 
protections, described by Petitioners 
and detailed below, would mitigate the 
risk of a shortfall of available assets for 
distribution resulting from customers’ 
participation in cross-margining. 
The first protection is Petitioners’ 
cross-margining margin calculation 
methodology. Under the cross- 
margining arrangement permitted by the 
Proposed Order, eligible positions of a 
participating customer would be 
identified and considered as a combined 
portfolio. Each of CME and FICC would 
use its own margin model to determine 
the amount of margin savings 
percentage resulting from combining the 
portfolio and then would jointly apply 
the more conservative result. Thus, 
under the framework, both CME and 
FICC would use, as part of calculating 
the margin requirement, the same 
methodology developed by CME under 
the supervision of the Commission for 
non-cross-margined positions, unless 
the margin methodology developed by 
FICC under the supervision of the SEC 
provides a more conservative result. The 
margin the BD–FCM would collect after 
cross-margining would at no time be 
less than what would be required by 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:12 Dec 16, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\17DEP1.SGM 17DEP1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS58533 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Proposed Rules 53
See Commission Regulation 190.07(d)(2) (‘‘if all eligible commodity contract accounts held by a 
debtor cannot be transferred under this section, a 
partial transfer may nonetheless be made.’’). 
54
This is consistent with the approach set forth 
in the GMAC Recommendation, III.2, at p. 3. 
55
Under that framework, if the percentage 
shortfall for cross-margining customers, considered 
alone, would be greater than that for non-cross- 
margining customers, considered alone, then the 
cross-margining customers would be treated 
separately from non-cross-margining customers, 
thus protecting the non-cross-margining customers. 
If, instead, the percentage shortfall for non-cross- 
margining customers is equal to or greater than the 
percentage shortfall for cross-margining customers, 
then the cross-margining customers and the non- 
cross-margining customers will be paid pro rata 
over the same pool, to the disadvantage of the cross- 
margining customers. 
56
See Section 3(a)(23)(A) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(23)(A); SEC Rule 17Ab2–1. 
57
Compare, e.g., 17 CFR 39.33(a)(1) and 
240.17ad–22(e)(4)(ii); 17 CFR 39.11(e), 39.33(c), and 
240.17ad–22(e)(7)(i) and (ii). 
58
See section III.A., supra, Commingling. CME’s margin methodology, because the 
margin requirement applied would be 
the more conservative of the 
requirement calculated by either FICC 
or CME’s margin model. Thus, the risk 
that the BD–FCM would hold 
inadequate margin for cross-margining 
positions is no different in kind, and no 
greater, than the risk that the BD–FCM 
would hold inadequate margin for other 
types of positions. 
Second, the Commission 
preliminarily believes that futures 
customers of each participating BD– 
FCM would be protected from a loss 
during a BD–FCM bankruptcy because, 
as discussed above, all customer funds, 
including cross-margining customer 
funds held by FICC, would be treated as 
‘‘customer property’’ for purposes of 
applying subchapter IV of chapter 7 of 
the Bankruptcy Code and part 190 of the 
Commission’s regulations regarding 
bankruptcy. This ensures that during a 
BD–FCM bankruptcy, all commingled 
customer funds in the futures account 
would receive similar protections, and 
non-participating customers would not 
experience a shortfall of the 
commingled customer funds caused by 
different treatment of cross-margining 
futures customer funds in bankruptcy. 
Third, as described above, the risk 
that in the event of FICC’s bankruptcy 
there would be any shortfall in the 
funds needed to satisfy the entitlements 
of cross-margining customers is low, 
given the protections provided under 
NYUCC Article 8 and the rule changes 
that FICC has undertaken to make, in 
particular, the fact that only the 
segregated accounts (for cross-margining 
customers and securities customers) 
would be entitlement holders. In 
addition, in order to allow the 
Commission to confirm that FICC would 
be at all times holding sufficient funds 
in its segregated accounts to satisfy all 
security entitlements, FICC would 
provide the Commission and the SEC 
each business day with reporting on the 
cash and, by CUSIP, securities (a) owed 
to BD–FCMs on behalf of their cross- 
margining customers or securities 
customers and (b) maintained in such 
accounts. This constitutes an additional 
protection that would minimize the risk 
FICC would pose to customers not 
participating in cross-margining. 
Fourth, CME would have a security 
interest in the FICC customer property, 
and CME and FICC cross-guaranty to 
pay the other amounts owing by a 
defaulted clearing member in 
accordance with an agreed calculation 
methodology. In the event that CME 
faces a deficit based on amounts owed 
to CME by a defaulted BD–FCM with 
respect to its cross-margining customers’ 
positions cleared at CME, FICC would 
guarantee those obligations up to the 
value of the relevant customers’ FICC 
customer property. Petitioners designed 
these features to allow CME to look to 
the FICC customer property to satisfy 
deficits owing to CME by the cross- 
margining customers, reducing the risk 
of a shortfall that could adversely 
impact non-participating customers. 
Finally, the Commission preliminarily 
believes that the availability of 
customer-level cross-margining under 
the customer cross-margining 
framework should not adversely affect 
the portability of non-participating 
futures customers. The part 190 
regulations permit a bankruptcy or SIPA 
trustee of a failed BD–FCM to transfer 
the margin and positions of a non- 
participant customer even if it cannot 
similarly transfer a cross-margining 
customer’s positions and margin.
53
 
The Commission preliminarily 
accepts that, given the protections 
described above, CME and FICC should 
not be required to subordinate the 
claims of cross-margining customers 
relative to other futures customers 
pursuant to the special distribution 
framework in framework 1 of appendix 
B to the Commission’s part 190 
regulations.
54
That framework would 
effectively subordinate the claims of 
cross-margining customers relative to 
other customers.
55
In light of the 
foregoing, the Commission preliminarily 
concludes that the risks posed to the 
BD–FCM futures customer account from 
the proposed cross-margining program 
are not materially greater in degree or 
kind than the risks posed by other 
futures positions and portfolio 
margining. Accordingly, under the 
Proposed Order, the special distribution 
framework would not be applied to the 
cross-margining framework thereunder, 
and BD–FCMs would be permitted to 
hold cross-margining customers’ assets 
commingled with non-cross-margining 
futures customers’ assets. 
IV. Customer Protection—Permitted 
Depository 
The CEA and Commission regulations 
also protect futures customer funds by 
requiring that the funds be held only at 
a permitted depository. Pursuant to 
Commission Regulation 1.20(b), FCMs 
are only permitted to hold futures 
customer funds with a bank or trust 
company, a DCO, or another FCM. 
Similarly, under Commission 
Regulation 1.20(g), DCOs are only 
permitted to hold futures customer 
funds with a bank or trust company, 
which may include a Federal Reserve 
Bank with respect to deposits by DCOs 
that have been designated as SIFMUs by 
the FSOC. Moreover, pursuant to 
Commission Regulation 1.49(d), a 
depository in the United States holding 
customer funds required to be 
segregated pursuant to the CEA and 
Commission regulations must: (A) be a 
bank or trust company, a DCO, or an 
FCM; and (B) provide appropriate 
written acknowledgment as required 
under Commission Regulations 1.20 and 
1.26. Because FICC is not a bank, trust 
company, DCO, or FCM, it is not a 
permitted depository under Commission 
Regulations 1.20 and 1.49. 
As discussed above, the customer 
cross-margining framework under the 
Proposed Order would require BD– 
FCMs to post to FICC, and FICC to hold, 
XM Customer Margin. The Commission 
preliminarily agrees with Petitioners 
that it is consistent with the public 
interest to permit FICC to hold XM 
Customer Margin subject to the terms 
and conditions of the Proposed Order. 
As a designated SIFMU and an SEC 
covered clearing agency,
56
FICC is 
subject to requirements and safeguards, 
including in relation to capital 
requirements and risk management, 
pursuant to SEC regulations, that are 
broadly similar to those that apply 
under the CFTC’s regulations to a 
systemically important DCO.
57
 
Furthermore, the Commission 
preliminarily agrees with Petitioners 
that FICC would hold XM Customer 
Margin in a manner that is consistent 
with how DCOs are required to hold 
futures customer funds under CEA 
section 4d(b).
58
Further, as required by 
section (e)(vii) of the Proposed Order, 
FICC would deposit cross-margining 
customer funds in accounts at the

FRBNY, or at a commercial bank, with

Moreover, the Commission 
preliminarily believes that the design 
and safeguards of the customer cross- 
margining framework under the 
Proposed Order is intended, as 
described above,
59
will leverage both 
part 190 and commercial law, and in 
particular the NYUCC, effectively to 
ensure that XM Customer Margin held 
at FICC is available either to CME to 
satisfy shortfalls in its futures customer 
account and/or returned to customers 
regardless of the solvency of FICC. 
Thus, the Commission preliminarily 
concludes that FICC as a depository 
offers similar safeguards and financial 
security as a DCO registered with the 
Commission, which is a permitted 
depository under Commission 
Regulations 1.20 and 1.49. Accordingly, 
the Commission is preliminarily 
persuaded that allowing BD–FCMs to 
deposit customer funds with FICC, and 
FICC to hold such funds in the manner 
described herein, is consistent with the 
objectives of the CEA and Commission 
regulations promulgated thereunder. 
V. Proposed Partial and Conditional 
Exemption From Section 4d of the CEA 
and Commission Regulations 1.20 and 
1.49 
In light of the foregoing, the 
Commission proposes to exempt CME, 
FICC, and BD–FCM members of CME 
and FICC from section 4d of the CEA 
and Commission Regulations 1.20 and 
1.49, subject to the conditions detailed 
above, to the extent necessary to permit 
the customer cross-margining 
framework described herein. The 
Commission proposes to allow the 
commingling of futures customer funds 
and futures customer positions with 
cross-margined securities assets held at 
BD–FCMs, for the purpose of customer 
cross-margining between positions held 
at CME and FICC. Further, the 
Commission proposes to permit CME 
and the BD–FCM members to deposit 
with FICC, and FICC to receive and 
hold, such futures customer funds even 
though FICC is not a permitted 
depository under Commission 
regulations. 
The Commission has in the past 
permitted FCMs to commingle customer 
futures or swap positions with cleared 
positions in other products for the 
purposes of achieving risk offsets and 
portfolio margining, subject to specific 
terms and conditions designed to 
protect both participating and non- 
participating customers.
60
As discussed 
above, the Commission preliminarily 
believes that CME and FICC would hold 
the commingled customer funds in a 
manner consistent with the customer 
protections intended by the CEA and 
Commission regulations. Customer 
assets would be segregated from other 
assets, and other customer protections 
in Commission regulations, such as the 
written acknowledgement from a 
depository regarding its obligations with 
regard to customer funds, would apply. 
The Commission preliminarily 
believes the Proposed Order contains 
the terms necessary to ensure adequate 
protection for futures customer funds. 
The Proposed Order provides for the 
safe treatment of cross-margining 
customer funds through terms requiring 
FICC and CME to carry cross-margining 
customer assets separately and treat 
them as belonging to the customers of 
the BD–FCM.
61
The Proposed Order 
also contains terms supporting the 
bankruptcy treatment for cross- 
margining customer funds described 
above, including a term requiring BD– 
FCMs to enter into agreements with 
participating customers acknowledging 
their assets’ bankruptcy treatment; terms 
on FICC holding customer margin 
segregated in a ‘‘securities account’’ at 
appropriate depositories and agreeing to 
treat such margin as ‘‘financial assets,’’ 
as such terms are defined under NYUCC 
Article 8; and a term requiring FICC to 
permit the porting of customer 
property.
62
The Proposed Order further 
requires Petitioners to have the rules 
and agreements necessary to ensure 
customer cross-margining functions as 
described above, by having rules on 
customer and position eligibility and on 
the granting of security interests in 
cross-margining customer property.
63
 
The Proposed Order also contains terms 
to ensure adequate margin is collected 
under the customer cross-margining 
program and to ensure adequate 
regulatory oversight.
64
 
The Commission preliminarily 
believes that the cross-margining 
framework under the Proposed Order 
would make it likely that customer 
funds will receive adequate protection 
during a BD–FCM bankruptcy. As 
described above, the customer funds 
held by FICC would constitute 
‘‘customer property’’ held by the BD– 
FCM in its capacity as an FCM for the 
purposes of distribution in bankruptcy 
and would be available to customers. 
This is designed to ensure that cross- 
margining customers would have the 
same priority right to receive 
distribution on their allowed claims 
against the customer property as other 
customers of the insolvent BD–FCM in 
the futures account class. In addition, 
FICC and CME would provide for the 
porting of the commingled cross- 
margined positions in the event of a 
clearing member default. 
As described in section III.B above, 
the risks to cross-margining customers 
posed by a FICC bankruptcy would be 
addressed. FICC would, consistent with 
the Proposed Order, take steps to ensure 
any assets credited to a FICC XM 
Customer Margin Account would be 
available for distribution to customers 
in a FICC bankruptcy or a proceeding 
under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
For the reasons discussed in section 
III.C above, under applicable law, 
customer property would not be used to 
satisfy the claims of FICC’s creditors, 
except for margining or settling 
customer positions, and would not form 
part of FICC’s estate. Accordingly, the 
Commission preliminarily believes 
cross-margining customer funds would 
be adequately protected in a FICC 
bankruptcy or Title II proceeding. 
For the reasons discussed in section 
III.D above, the Commission also 
preliminarily believes customers who 
do not participate in cross-margining are 
unlikely to be impacted by the cross- 
margining arrangement. As described 
above, the more conservative cross- 
margining margin methodology of either 
CME or FICC would be applied. Also, 
customer funds are likely to be 
effectively protected in the unlikely 
event of a FICC bankruptcy, making it 
unlikely non-participating customers 
would experience losses in that case. 
Further, portability for non-participating 
customers is not adversely affected by 
other customers participating in cross- 
margining. The Commission 
preliminarily does not believe the risks 
posed to the BD–FCM futures customer 
account from the cross-margining 
program under the Proposed Order are 
materially greater in degree or kind than 
the risks posed by other futures 
positions and portfolio margining. Thus, 
the Commission does not propose to 
impose via its order the special 
distribution framework in framework 1 
of appendix B to the Commission’s part 
190 regulations. 
The Commission also preliminarily 
believes, for the reasons discussed in

section IV above, that customers would 
not be harmed by allowing FICC to act 
as a depository for customer funds. As 
discussed above, FICC would offer 
similar safeguards and financial security 
as a DCO registered with the 
Commission, because it is a designated 
SIFMU and an SEC covered clearing 
agency. BD–FCMs depositing customer 
funds with FICC, and FICC holding such 
funds, is consistent with safety and 
security purposes of the Commission 
regulations requiring that only certain 
depositories hold customer funds. 
The Commission preliminarily 
believes the participants will be 
appropriate persons. The definition of 
‘‘appropriate person’’ under section 
4(c)(3) of the CEA includes specified 
categories of persons as well as ‘‘other 
persons that the Commission 
determines to be appropriate in light of 
their financial or other qualifications, or 
the applicability of appropriate 
regulatory protections’’ (emphasis 
added). 
Each of FICC, CME, and the eligible 
BD–FCMs is an appropriate person 
under prong (F), (I), or (J) of the 
definition. 
The Commission determines cross- 
margining customers should be treated 
as appropriate persons for purposes of 
section 4(c)(3) of the CEA in light of the 
existing and appropriate regulatory 
protections for eligible customers under 
the CEA and Commission regulations as 
well as the safeguards under the 
proposed customer cross-margining 
framework. Specifically, the 
Commissioner preliminarily accepts 
Petitioners’ assertion that each eligible 
customer would be a person that is 
permitted to transact through a BD– 
FCM. In other words, such customers 
are already persons that Congress and 
regulators have determined to be 
appropriate to engage in such 
transactions. Allowing eligible 
customers to opt into cross-margining 
under the proposed customer cross- 
margining framework would not unduly 
expose such customers to additional 
risk. Additionally, the customer cross- 
margining framework under the 
Proposed Order and the Proposed Order 
itself include the customer protection 
and risk management safeguards 
discussed above to ensure that the 
requested relief would not cause any 
material adverse effect on the 
Commission’s or CME’s ability to fulfill 
its regulatory or self-regulatory duties. 
Finally, the Commission preliminarily 
concludes that, in light of the risk 
mitigants and customer protections 
discussed above, customer cross- 
margining under the Proposed Order 
would support the stability of the 
broader financial system. Cross- 
margining would lower the cost of 
central clearing for Treasury securities 
transactions and certain Treasury and 
interest rate futures, by decreasing 
customers’ initial margin requirements 
to reflect the risk of a combined 
portfolio. Lowering clearing costs would 
support the implementation, and lower 
the financial burden, of the Treasury 
Clearing Requirement, which itself 
supports financial stability by 
increasing central clearing. In light of 
the foregoing, the Commission 
preliminarily believes the Proposed 
Order would promote responsible 
economic and financial innovation and 
fair competition, and would be 
consistent with the public interest, as 
that term is used in section 4(c) of the 
CEA. 
VI. Related Matters 
A. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(‘‘RFA’’)
65
requires that agencies 
consider whether the proposed 
exemption will have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities and, if so, 
provide a regulatory flexibility analysis 
respecting the impact. The Commission 
believes that the proposed exemption 
will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. 
The Proposed Order will directly 
impact three categories of entities: CME 
(a DCO), FICC (a clearing agency 
registered with the SEC) and BD–FCM 
members of both CME and FICC. The 
Commission has previously established 
certain definitions of ‘‘small entities’’ to 
be used by the Commission in 
evaluating the impact of its actions on 
small entities in accordance with the 
RFA.
66
The Commission has previously 
determined that DCOs, are not small 
entities for purposes of the RFA.
67
 
Further, the Commission has previously 
determined that registered FCMs are not 
small entities for the purpose of the 
RFA,
68
and BD–FCMs are, by definition, 
FCMs. 
With respect to FICC, the SEC has 
established threshold definitions in its 
regulations governing when clearing 
agencies registered with the SEC qualify 
as small entities. Specifically, the SEC’s 
regulations provide that, when used 
with reference to a clearing agency, the 
terms ‘‘small business’’ or ‘‘small 
organization’’ shall include a clearing 
agency that: (i) compared, cleared, and 
settled less than $500 million in 
securities transactions during the 
preceding fiscal year; (ii) had less than 
$200 million of funds and securities in 
its custody or control at all times during 
the preceding fiscal year (or at any time 
that it has been in business, if shorter); 
and (iii) is not affiliated with any person 
(other than a natural person) that is not 
a small business or small organization.
69
 
The Commission notes that FICC 
processed $11.8 trillion on a single day, 
June 30, 2025,
70
and, as of December 31, 
2024, held in excess of $76 billion in 
post-haircut clearing fund contributions 
from its participants.
71
 
The Commission also believes the 
exemption will not have a substantial 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entity customers. Participation in cross- 
margining is voluntary. Further, the 
exemption proposed by the Commission 
will lower costs for customers with 
positions at both CME and FICC, 
reducing the cost of clearing to reflect 
that of the total portfolio. As discussed 
above, the Commission expects that 
under the proposed cross-margining 
framework, participating cross- 
margining customers’ funds will still 
receive the level of protection mandated 
by the CEA and Commission 
regulations. Finally, as discussed above, 
non-participating customers will not be 
meaningfully impacted by the other 
customers participating in cross- 
margining. 
Accordingly, the Commission does 
not expect the proposed exemption to 
have a significant impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
Therefore, the Acting Chairman, on 
behalf of the Commission, hereby 
certifies, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), 
that the proposed exemption would not 
have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities. 
The Commission invites the public to 
comment on whether there is a 
significant impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. 
B. Paperwork Reduction Act 
The purposes of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 (‘‘PRA’’)
72
are, 
among other things, to minimize the 
paperwork burden to the private sector, 
ensure that any collection of 
information by a government agency is 
put to the greatest possible uses, and 
minimize duplicative information

collections across the government. The 
PRA applies to all information, 
‘‘regardless of form or format,’’ 
whenever the government is ‘‘obtaining, 
causing to be obtained [or] soliciting’’ 
information, and requires ‘‘disclosure to 
third parties or the public, of facts or 
opinions,’’ when the information 
collection calls for ‘‘answers to identical 
questions posed to, or identical 
reporting or recordkeeping requirements 
imposed on, ten or more persons.’’ The 
PRA would not apply in this case given 
that the exemption would not impose 
any new recordkeeping or information 
collection requirements, or other 
collections of information, on ten or 
more persons that require approval of 
the Office of Management and Budget. 
C. Cost and Benefit Considerations 
The Commission recognizes that the 
proposed order may impose costs. The 
Commission has endeavored to assess 
the expected costs and benefits of the 
proposed order in quantitative terms, 
where possible. In situations where the 
Commission is unable to quantify the 
costs and benefits, the Commission 
identifies and considers the costs and 
benefits of the applicable proposed 
amendments in qualitative terms. 
The Commission generally requests 
comment on all aspects of its cost- 
benefit considerations, including the 
identification and assessment of any 
costs and benefits not discussed herein; 
data and any other information to assist 
or otherwise inform the Commission’s 
ability to quantify or qualitatively 
describe the costs and benefits of the 
proposed order; and substantiating data, 
statistics, and any other information to 
support positions posited by 
commenters with respect to the 
Commission’s discussion. 
1. Baseline 
The Commission identifies and 
considers the benefits and costs of the 
proposed order relative to a baseline 
standard of those generated by the 
current statutory and regulatory 
framework applicable to futures 
contracts, i.e., the status quo. This framework includes the provisions in 
section 4d of the CEA and current 
Commission Regulations 1.20 and 
1.49(d). The specific elements of the 
baseline that would be impacted by the 
proposed amendments are discussed in 
more detail below. 
2. Costs 
The proposed exemption would 
conditionally exempt CME and FICC 
from limited aspects of sections 4d of 
the CEA and from the permitted 
depository requirements in Commission 
Regulations 1.20 and 1.49. While 
complying with the Commission’s order 
would entail compliance costs for CME, 
FICC, and eligible BD–FCMs, the order 
would not mandate participation in 
cross-margining and the assumption of 
these costs. To the extent CME, eligible 
BD–FCMs, and futures customers elect 
to participate in cross-margining, they 
are electing to assume any associated 
costs. Moreover, the conditions to the 
order are consistent with the design of 
the cross-margining program proposed 
by the Petitioners and are necessary to 
achieve the risk mitigants and customer 
protections that are the basis of that 
program. 
The cross-margining program that 
would be permitted under the Proposed 
Order is an instance of a portfolio 
margining system. Portfolio margining is 
widely used throughout the futures 
industry, both within individual DCOs 
and in cross-margining programs 
between clearing organizations (such as 
the existing proprietary cross-margining 
program between the Petitioners). 
Portfolio margining establishes 
margin levels by assessing the market 
risk of a ‘‘portfolio’’ of positions in 
securities or commodities. Under a 
portfolio margining system, the amount 
of required margin is determined by 
analyzing the risk of each component 
position in a customer account (e.g., a class of option with the same expiration 
date) and by recognizing any risk offsets 
in an overall portfolio of positions (e.g., 
across options and futures on the same 
underlying instrument). So that 
adequate margin is deposited to cover 
extraordinary market events, one or 
more additional adjustments may be 
applied in calculating a customer’s 
required margin.
73
 
The calculation of the risk offsets that 
are recognized in a portfolio margining 
system is based on a combination of 
statistical analysis of the correlation 
between the components of the portfolio 
and judgment, and is subject to rigorous 
risk management, including through 
back-testing. 
Nonetheless, inherent in any portfolio 
margining system is the possibility that, 
during a particular stressed market 
movement, the losses experienced on 
the combined position will exceed the 
margin requirement remaining after 
including those risk offsets, leading to a 
margin deficiency that is greater than 
would have been the case had the risk 
offset not been recognized. 
If such an event were to occur within 
the context of the cross-margining 
program that is the subject of the 
Proposed Order, and the margin 
deficiency within the futures or 
securities customer accounts of a 
participating BD–FCM were to exceed 
the capital and other resources available 
to that BD–FCM, leading to bankruptcy, 
then customers might suffer losses in 
the bankruptcy of that BD–FCM that 
would be larger than if that cross- 
margining program were not enabled. 
This possibility is a cost of granting the 
Proposed Order. 
However, the likelihood of such 
losses is low if the risks are well 
managed as required in the proposed 
customer cross-margining framework. 
Given the highly regulated and resilient 
natures of CME as a DCO and FICC as 
a securities clearing agency, the 
experience the two clearing 
organizations have in implementing 
portfolio margining and in particular 
cross-margining programs, the risk 
management requirements described in 
section III.D, and the protections 
included in the proposed customer 
cross-margining framework, the 
Commission estimates that the 
circumstances that may give rise to such 
costs would be very remote. The costs 
associated with these risks are difficult 
to quantify because they depend on 
unknown and unlikely future events to 
materialize, but the Commission 
acknowledges some residual risk 
remains that could impose costs on 
Petitioners, clearing members and 
customers. 
3. Benefits 
The proposed exemption would 
benefit market participants by reducing 
the costs of clearing Treasury securities 
transactions in a manner that aligns the 
margin required for a portfolio of risk- 
related positions, involving positions 
cleared at CME and positions cleared at 
FICC, with the risk of the portfolio 
considered as a whole. Individual 
market participants participating in 
cross-margining will benefit from the 
reduced margin costs for their overall 
portfolio. BD–FCMs will also benefit 
from more efficient clearing, as they, 
and in turn FICC and CME, will reduce 
their risk exposure to the cross- 
margining customer. 
The proposed exemption will also 
benefit the broader financial system. By 
making Treasury security clearing less 
costly, the proposed exemption is 
expected to incentivize clearing of 
Treasury security transactions. As 
discussed above, centralized clearing 
reduces the risk of default by imposing 
a central counterparty between buyers 
and sellers, and can lower the potential 
for a single market participant’s failure 
to destabilize other market participants

7 U.S.C. 19(a). 
or the financial system more broadly. 
The Commission considers central 
clearing through a highly regulated 
clearing organization to be highly 
supportive of financial stability. Thus, 
the proposed customer cross-margining 
framework benefits the public interest 
because it will support the stability of 
the broader financial system. 
D. Section 15(a) Factors 
Section 15(a) of the CEA requires the 
Commission to consider the costs and 
benefits of its action before issuing an 
order under the CEA.
74
Section 15(a) 
requires the Commission to consider the 
costs and benefits of its action in light 
of five broad areas of market and public 
concern: (1) protection of market 
participants and the public; (2) 
efficiency, competitiveness, and 
financial integrity of futures markets; (3) 
price discovery; (4) sound risk 
management practices; and (5) other 
public interest considerations. The 
Commission considers the costs and 
benefits resulting from its discretionary 
determinations with respect to the 
section 15(a) factors. The Commission 
may in its discretion give greater weight 
to any one of the five enumerated areas 
and could in its discretion determine 
that, notwithstanding its costs, a 
particular order is necessary or 
appropriate to protect the public interest 
or to effectuate any of the provisions or 
to accomplish any of the purposes of the 
CEA. 
1. Protection of Market Participants and 
the Public 
The Commission believes the 
proposed exemption will benefit the 
public and market participants while 
not adversely affecting protections. The 
proposed exemption would serve the 
public by encouraging the clearing of 
Treasury securities transactions, thus 
increasing financial stability, which 
serves the public’s interest generally. 
Market participants’ individual 
financial interests are also served by 
making clearing less expensive and 
more efficient. 
The Commission does not believe that 
the exemption would adversely impact 
the security of market participants’ 
assets. As discussed above, the 
conditions to the proposed order that 
would permit the proposed cross- 
margining framework implement 
safeguards to protect futures customer 
funds. The cross-margined funds will be 
segregated from any proprietary funds 
and will still receive the protections 
found in the CEA and Commission 
regulations. The futures customer funds 
will be subject to the CEA’s protections 
in a potential bankruptcy of a 
participating BD–FCM (or CME) and 
will be protected under NYUCC Article 
8 in a potential bankruptcy of FICC. In 
addition, the Commission believes the 
risks to non-participating customers, 
such as clearing in an account class in 
which other participants have margin 
set through portfolio margining 
incorporating Treasury securities, are 
similar to the risks posed by customers 
clearing in a class where others hold 
futures positions and have their 
positions portfolio margined. Finally, 
FICC, as a depository regulated as a 
covered clearing agency and a SIFMU 
by the SEC, is comparable as a matter 
of safety to other permitted depositories, 
so no material additional risk is added 
for market participants by the 
Commission permitting FICC as a 
depository. 
2. Efficiency, Competitiveness, and 
Financial Integrity 
The Commission believes that the 
proposed exemption will benefit the 
efficiency, competitiveness, and 
financial integrity of the derivatives 
markets. The proposed exemption will 
make clearing more efficient by 
permitting cross-margining of Treasury 
futures with Treasury securities. Cross- 
margining enables CME and FICC to 
lower margin requirements to reflect the 
risk of the total portfolio instead of the 
separate futures and securities 
positions, increasing the 
competitiveness of their offering. 
The proposed exemption also benefits 
financial integrity. The proposed 
exemption will support the 
implementation of the Treasury Clearing 
Requirement, a mandate implemented 
to increase the financial integrity of the 
Treasury securities market through 
expanded use of central clearing. A 
more stable Treasury securities market 
also benefits the financial integrity of 
the financial system (including the 
derivatives markets) more broadly. 
3. Price Discovery 
The Commission does not anticipate 
the proposed exemption to have an 
impact on price discovery. 
4. Sound Risk Management Practices 
The Commission believes that the 
proposed exemptive order, in light of 
the conditions included, reflects sound 
risk management practices. Encouraging 
central clearing supports sound risk 
management. As stated above, 
centralized clearing through a highly 
regulated clearing agency decreases the 
risk of default and risk of market 
destabilization. Additionally, cross- 
margining reflects sound risk 
management because margin costs will 
represent the risks for futures 
customers’ overall portfolios. 
The Commission further notes that, 
notwithstanding the proposed 
exemption, cross-margining futures 
customers would receive protections 
comparable to what they would have 
received absent the exemption. Risks to 
customer funds will be managed and 
minimized according to the standards 
set forth in the CEA. 
5. Other Public Interest Considerations 
The Commission believes the relevant 
public interest considerations are 
already discussed in the foregoing. 
VII. Request for Comment 
The Commission requests comment 
on all aspects of the proposed 
exemption, including, without 
limitation, the Commission’s 
determination that the proposed 
exemption is consistent with the public 
interest, and the Commission’s 
consideration of the costs and benefits 
of the proposed exemption. 
VIII. Proposed Order of Exemption 
After considering the above factors, 
the Commission proposes to issue the 
following: 
Proposed Order 
The Commission, pursuant to its 
authority under section 4(c) of the CEA, 
7 U.S.C. 6(c), and subject to the 
conditions below, hereby grants (A) a 
limited exemption to Commission 
Regulations 1.20 and 1.49 to permit 
dually-registered BD–FCMs that are

to hold, customer funds and margin 
associated with customer cross- 
margining, and to permit CME to treat 
FICC as a permissible location to hold 
the foregoing; and (B) a limited 
exemption to section 4d(a)(2) of the CEA 
and Commission regulations thereunder 
to permit eligible BD–FCMs to hold, in 
a futures account, eligible securities 
positions and associated money,

which the cross-margining customer 
shall specifically agree and 
acknowledge that: 
i. Its XM Securities Customer Property

organizations shall amend their 
proprietary cross-margining agreement, 
as may be necessary to effect the 
customer cross-margining framework as 
described in CME and FICC’s petition 
and the terms of this Order. This 
specifically includes addressing the 
following: 
i. Cross-margining is available to 
Eligible Customer Positions only if both 
the eligible customer and its Eligible 
BD–FCM agree to participate; 
ii. Positions of an eligible customer 
shall be eligible for cross-margining if 
and only if such positions are otherwise 
eligible positions under the existing 
proprietary cross-margining 
arrangement;

a security interest in the value of each 
cross-margining customer’s Eligible 
Securities Positions and associated 
margin held in a cross-margining

in connection with Eligible Securities 
Positions to a ‘‘securities account’’ and 
agree in its rules to treat such margin as 
‘‘financial assets,’’ as such terms are 
defined under NYUCC Article 8; 
v. FICC rules will provide that any 
collateral received from a BD–FCM as 
XM Securities Customer Property and 
credited to a FICC cross-margining 
customer margin account will be used

FCM and for no other purpose; 
vi. FICC rules will provide that FICC 
shall not grant a security interest in 
either XM Securities Customer Property 
(subject in this case to the proviso that 
the BD–FCM can grant CME and FICC 
a lien to implement the cross-margining 
program) or FICC Treasury securities 
customer margin; 
vii. FICC rules will provide that it 
shall hold all XM Customer Margin in 
an account of FICC at either a bank that 
is insured by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation or at the FRBNY. 
Such account shall be: 
1. Segregated from any other account 
of FICC and shall be used exclusively to 
hold XM Customer Margin, except that 
the account at the FRBNY may also hold 
Segregated Customer Margin. 
2. In the case of a bank other than the 
FRBNY, subject to a written notice by 
the bank, provided to and retained by 
FICC, that the Segregated Customer 
Margin in the account is being held by 
the bank pursuant to the order of the 
Commission under section 4(c) of the 
Commodity Exchange Act and is being 
kept separate from and not commingled 
with any other accounts maintained by 
FICC or any other person at the bank. 
3. In the case of FRBNY, subject to a 
written notice provided to and retained 
by FICC that the Segregated Customer 
Margin in the account is being held by 
the bank pursuant to SEC Rule 15c3–3 
and the order of the Commission under 
section 4(c) of the Commodity Exchange 
Act and is being kept separate from and 
not commingled with any other 
accounts maintained by FICC or any 
other person at the bank. 
4. Each such account shall also be 
subject to a written contract between 
FICC and the bank or FRBNY which 
provides that the Segregated Customer 
Margin in the account is subject to no 
right, charge, security interest, lien, or

[Docket Number USCG–2025–0936] 
RIN 1625–AA08 
Special Local Regulation; Milwaukee 
River, Milwaukee, WI 
AGENCY: Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is proposing to update special local regulations (SLR) 
for certain navigable waters of the 
Milwaukee River. The SLR update is 
needed to make the regulations more 
accurate and to continue to protect 
personnel, vessels, and the marine 
environment from potential hazards 
created by a boat race. This proposed 
rulemaking would delete an outdated 
SLR for the Milwaukee Open Water 
Swim and update the Milwaukee River 
Challenge to change the date from ‘‘1 
day; the third Saturday of September.’’ 
to ‘‘1 day; on or around early October.’’ 
We invite your comments on this 
proposed rulemaking. 
DATES: Comments and related material must be received by the Coast Guard on 
or before January 16, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: To submit comments and view available documents, go to the 
Federal Docket Management System at 
https://www.regulations.gov and search for USCG–2025–0936.

rule, contact LCDR Lynn Schrayshuen,

§ Section 
U.S.C. United States Code 
II. Background and Authority 
On September 24, 2025, the Coast 
Guard met with the event sponsors for 
the Milwaukee River Challenge and 
confirmed that their event, which is in 
its 24th year, will occur annually on or 
around the beginning of October due to 
reduced conflict with recreational and 
commercial vessels during that 
timeframe. The Captain of the Port 
Sector Lake Michigan (COTP) is 
proposing to update the Special Local 
Regulations in Table 1 to 33 CFR 
100.903 for recurring marine events in 
the COTP Zone to reflect this change 
and to eliminate outdated regulations. 
The COTP is proposing these updates 
under the authority in 46 U.S.C. 70041 
and 33 CFR 1.05–1, as they are needed 
to protect personnel, vessels, and the 
marine environment in the navigable 
waters within the regulated area. The 
regulatory text we are proposing appears 
at the end of this document.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS58540 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Proposed Rules III. Discussion of the Rule 
This proposed rule would update the 
date for an established special regulated 
area in Table 1 to 33 CFR 100.903, the 
Milwaukee River Challenge, from ‘‘1 
day; the third Saturday of September.’’ 
to ‘‘1 day; on or around early October.’’ 
The event title and the location of the 
regulated area would remain the same. 
No vessel or person would be permitted 
to enter the regulated area without 
obtaining permission from the COTP or 
their designated representative. The 
proposed rule also would delete the 
Milwaukee Open Water Swim from the 
regulatory text in Table 1 (currently 
Item 6), as this event no longer occurs. 
The regulatory text we are proposing 
appears at the end of this document. 
IV. Regulatory Analyses 
We developed this proposed rule after 
considering numerous statutes and 
Executive orders related to rulemaking. 
Below we summarize our analyses 
based on a number of these statutes and 
Executive orders. 
A. Impact on Small Entities 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 
1980, 5 U.S.C. 601–612, as amended, 
requires Federal agencies to consider 
the potential impact of regulations on 
small entities during rulemaking. The 
term ‘‘small entities’’ comprises small 
businesses, not-for-profit organizations 
that are independently owned and 
operated and are not dominant in their 
fields, and governmental jurisdictions 
with populations of less than 50,000. 
The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 
605(b) that this proposed rule would not 
have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities 
for the following reasons. 
This regulation would only impact 
the Milwaukee River for less than 8 
hours. The enforcement period would 
be during a time when vessel traffic is 
normally low. In addition, the Coast 
Guard would issue a Broadcast Notice to 
Marines via VHF FM marine channel 
16, which would allow small entities to 
adjust their transit plans, and the rule 
would allow vessels to request 
permission to enter the regulated area 
from the COTP. 
If you think that your business, 
organization, or governmental 
jurisdiction qualifies as a small entity 
and that this proposed rule would have 
a significant economic impact on it, 
please submit a comment (see 
ADDRESSES) explaining why you think it 
qualifies and how and to what degree 
this proposed rule would economically 
affect it. 
Under section 213(a) of the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104–121), 
if this proposed rule will affect your 
small business, organization, or 
governmental jurisdiction and you have 
questions, contact the person listed in 
the 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 
section. Small businesses may send 
comments to the Small Business and 
Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement 
Ombudsman and the Regional Small 
Business Regulatory Fairness Boards by 
calling 1–888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734– 
3247). 
B. Collection of Information 
This proposed rule will not call for a 
new collection of information under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3501–3520). 
C. Federalism and Indian Tribal 
Governments 
We have analyzed this proposed rule 
under Executive Order 13132, 
Federalism, and have determined that it 
is consistent with the fundamental 
federalism principles and preemption 
requirements described in that Order. 
Also, this proposed rule does not have 
tribal implications under Executive 
Order 13175, Consultation and 
Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments, because it does not have 
a substantial direct effect on one or 
more Indian tribes, on the relationship 
between the Federal Government and 
Indian tribes, or on the distribution of 
power and responsibilities between the 
Federal Government and Indian tribes. 
D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
As required by The Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 
1531–1538), the Coast Guard certifies 
that this proposed rule would not result 
in an annual expenditure of 
$100,000,000 or more (adjusted for 
inflation) by a State, local, or tribal 
government, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector. 
E. Environment 
We have analyzed this proposed rule 
under Department of Homeland 
Security Directive 023–01, Rev. 1, 
associated implementing instructions, 
and Environmental Planning 
COMDTINST 5090.1 (series), which 
guide the Coast Guard in complying 
with the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321–4370f), and 
have determined that this action is one 
of a category of actions that do not 
individually or cumulatively have a 
significant effect on the human 
environment. 
This proposed rule is an update to a 
special regulated area. It is categorically 
excluded from further review under 
paragraph L61. 
V. Public Participation and Request for 
Comments 
We view public participation as 
essential to effective rulemaking and 
will consider all comments and material 
received during the comment period. 
Your comment can help shape the 
outcome of this rulemaking. If you 
submit a comment, please include the 
docket number for this rulemaking,

been delegated the authority to exercise 
the functions of the Secretary as 
provided in the Federal Meat Inspection 
Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the 
Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) 
(21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.), and the Egg 
Products Inspection Act (EPIA) (21 
U.S.C. 1031 et seq.). These statutes 
mandate that FSIS protect the public by 
verifying that meat, poultry, and egg 
products are safe, wholesome, and 
properly labeled. 
The Federal Meat Inspection Act 
(FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 620) and the Poultry 
Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 
U.S.C. 466) prohibit the importation of 
meat and poultry products into the 
United States if such products are 
adulterated or misbranded and unless 
they comply with all the inspection and 
other requirements of the Acts and 
regulations as are applied to domestic 
products. The Egg Products Inspection 
Act (EPIA) (21 U.S.C. 1046) prohibits 
the importation of egg products unless 
they were processed under an approved 
continuous inspection system of the 
government of the foreign country of 
origin and comply with the other 
pertinent requirements of the Act and 
regulations as they are applied to 
domestic products. 
Need and Use of the Information: 
FSIS requires foreign governments to 
submit additional information when 
submitting both the foreign 
establishment certificate and the foreign 
inspection certificate to FSIS for foreign 
establishments to be permitted to import 
product to the United States. 
The information that is required with 
the Foreign Establishment Certificate 
includes: the type of operation(s) 
conducted at the establishment (e.g., 
slaughter, processing, storage, exporting 
warehouse); the establishment’s 
eligibility status (e.g., new or relisted (if previously delisted)); and, slaughter and 
processing establishment certifications 
that address the species and type of 
product(s) produced at the

Administration 
The Department of Commerce will 
submit the following information 
collection request to the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) for 
review and clearance in accordance 
with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995, on or after the date of publication 
of this notice. We invite the general 
public and other Federal agencies to 
comment on proposed and continuing 
information collections, which helps us 
assess the impact of our information 
collection requirements and minimize 
the public’s reporting burden. Public 
comments were previously requested 
via the Federal Register on July 14, 
2025, during a 60-day comment period. 
This notice allows for an additional 30 
days for public comments. 
Agency: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 
Commerce. 
Title: Surfclam/Ocean Quahog Individual Transfer Quota (ITQ) 
Administration. 
OMB Control Number: 0648–0240. 
Form Number(s): None. 
Type of Request: Regular submission 
[extension of a current information 
collection]. 
Number of Respondents: 180 unique 
respondents. 
Average Hours per Response: ITQ 
permit application form, review of a 
pre-filled form for renewing entities, 
ITQ transfer form, 5 minutes each; 1 
hour to complete the ITQ ownership 
form for new applicants and 30 minutes 
for the application to shuck Surfclams 
and ocean quahogs at sea. The 
requirements under the paralytic 
shellfish poisoning (PSP) protocol are 
based on the number of vessels that land 
Surfclams or ocean quahogs and the 
number of trips taken into the area. 
Total Annual Burden Hours: 194 
hours. 
Needs and Uses: This request is for an 
extension of a currently approved 
collection associated with the Atlantic 
surfclam and ocean quahog fisheries. 
National Marine Fisheries Service 
(NMFS) Greater Atlantic Region 
manages these fisheries in the Exclusive 
Economic Zone (EEZ) of the 
Northeastern United States through the 
Atlantic Surfclam and Ocean Quahog 
Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The 
Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management 
Council prepared the FMP pursuant to 
the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act 
(Magnuson-Stevens Act). The 
regulations implementing the FMP are 
specified at 50 CFR part 648. 
The recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements at §§ 648.74, 648.75, and 
648.76 form the basis for this collection 
of information. We request information 
from surfclam and ocean quahog 
individual transferable quota (ITQ) 
permit holders to issue ITQ permits and 
to process and track requests from 
permit holders to transfer quota share or 
cage tags. We also request information 
from surfclam and ocean quahog ITQ 
permit holders to track and properly 
account for surfclam and ocean quahog 
harvest shucked at sea. Because there is 
not a standard conversion factor for 
estimating unshucked product from 
shucked product, NMFS requires 
vessels that shuck product at sea to 
carry a NMFS-approved observer on 
board the vessel to certify the amount of 
these clams harvested. This information, 
upon receipt, results in an efficient and 
accurate database for management and 
monitoring of fisheries of the 
Northeastern U.S. EEZ. 
Georges Bank has been closed to the 
harvest of Surfclams and ocean quahogs 
since 1990 due to red tide blooms that 
cause paralytic shellfish poisoning 
(PSP). We reopened a portion of the 
Georges Bank Closed Area starting in 
2012 under certain conditions. We 
request information from surfclam and 
ocean quahog ITQ permit holders who 
fish in the reopened area to ensure 
compliance with the Protocol for 
Onboard Screening and Dockside 
Testing in Molluscan Shellfish. The U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration, the 
commercial fishing industry, and NMFS 
developed the PSP protocol to test and 
verify that clams harvested from 
Georges Bank continue to be safe for 
human consumption. The National 
Shellfish Sanitation Program adopted 
the PSP protocol at the October 2011 
Interstate Shellfish Sanitation 
Conference. 
Affected Public: Individuals and 
Business or other for-profit 
organizations. 
Frequency: Frequency varies from collection to collection (e.g., annual, per trip, as requested by the public). 
Respondent’s Obligation: Mandatory. 
Legal Authority: Magnuson-Stevens 
Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq., Section 
303).

Abstract: Section 487(c) of the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965, as 
amended, requires that the Secretary of 
Education prescribe regulations to 
ensure that any funds postsecondary 
institutions receive under the HEA are 
used solely for the purposes specified in 
and in accordance with the provision of 
the applicable programs. 
Part H, Subpart 3, Section 498 of the 
HEA of 1965, as amended, gives the 
Secretary the responsibility for 
determining qualifications of 
institutions of higher education to 
participate in programs under the HEA. 
To comply with this requirement 
Section 498(b) of the HEA specified that 
the Secretary prepare and prescribe a 
single application form. The Department 
of Education (the Department) 
developed the Application for Approval 
to Participate in the Federal Student 
Financial Aid Programs to comply with 
the statutory requirements of collecting 
necessary information under the HEA. 
An institution must use this Application 
to apply for approval to be determined 
to be eligible and if the institution 
wishes, to participate; to expand its 
eligibility; or to continue to participate 
in the Title IV programs. An institution 
must also use the Application to report 
certain required data as part of its 
recordkeeping requirements contained 
in the regulations under 34 CFR part 
600 (Institutional Eligibility under the 
Higher Education Act of 1965, as 
amended). 
The Department uses the information 
reported on the Application in its 
determination of whether an institution 
meets the statutory and regulatory 
requirements. This request is for a 
revision of the current information 
collection.

Re: Notice of Debarment, File No. EB-IHD-24-00037459 Dear Messrs. Asad and Feder: DA25-1008 
The Enforcement Bureau (Bureau) of the .Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) hereby notifies you that, pursuant to Section 54.8 of the Commission's rules, Issa Asad is 
prohibited from participating in activities associated with or related to the federal Lifeline program (Lifeline program) and any other program funded by federal universal service support mechanisms, commencing on either the date of Mr. Asad's receipt of this Notice of Debarment or of its publication in the Federal Register, whichever comes first (Debarment Date).1 
Furthermore, as a condition of the 
administrative settlement between the FCC and Mr. Asad, Q Link Wireless LLC (Q Link) and Q Link's parent company, Quadrant Holdings Group, LLC (Quadrant), which was entered into on January 17, 2025 (Administrative Settlement),2 Mr. Asad and Q Link ceased participating in any program administered by the FCC (in addition to the universal service programs) and agreed to debarment from participation in all 
such programs in the future. 3

In 2007, the Commission extended the debarment rules to apply to all federal universal service support mechanisms, including the Lifeline program. See Comprehensive Review of the Universal Service Fund Management, Administration, & Oversight, Report and Order, 22 FCC Red 16372, 16410-12 (2007) (Program Management Order) (renumbering §54.521 of the universal service debarment rules as§ 54.8 and amending subsections (a)(l ), (a)(5), (c), (d), (e)(2)(i), (e)(3), (e)(4), and (g)). 2

On November 8, 2024, the Bureau sent Mr. Asad a notice of suspension and initiation of 
debarment proceeding (Notice of Suspension) that was published in the Federal Register on December 12, 2024. 
4 
The Notice of Suspension suspended Mr. Asad from participating in or receiving any benefit 
associated with the Lifeline program as well as any other program funded by federal universal service support mechanisms. 5 
It also described the basis for initiating the debarment proceeding against Mr. Asad, the applicable debarment procedures, and the effect of debarment.
6 
As discussed in the Notice of Suspension, on October 15, 2024, Mr. Asad pleaded guilty to a two count information.7 
Count 1 consisted of Mr. Asad pleading guilty to conspiring to commit offenses against the United States, specifically, a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1343 (wire fraud) and a violation of 18 
U.S.C. 641 (thell of government funds), and conspiring to defraud the United States, all in violation of 18 
U.S.C. 371.8 
Count 2 consisted of Mr. Asad pleading guilty to one count of money laundering, in violation 
of 18 U.S.C. 1957, all in connection with the intentional submission of fraudulent claims for reimbursement from the federal Lifeline program.9 
Specifically, Mr. Asad and Q Link pleaded guilty to "purposely defraud[ing] two critical federal programs helping individuals and businesses suffering financial hardship, unlawfully taking hundreds of millions of dollars for [his] own use and profit, while obstructing the United States' ability to help people who ... needed it."10 
Mr. Asad served as the Chief 
Executive Officer ofQ Link beginning in 2012.
11 
From 2013 to 2021, Mr. Asad personally amassed over $15,000,000 through fraudulent Lifeline schemes.12 
Pursuant to§ 54.8(c) of the Commission's rules, Mr. Asad's conviction of criminal conduct in connection with the Lifeline program forms a key the basis for this debarment. 13 
Furthermore, on January 17, 2025, Mr. Asad entered into the Administrative Settlement, paragraph 
15 of which provides as follows: Q Link and Mr. Asad warrant that consistent with the Suspension Notices and the Commission's suspension rules (47 CFR 54.8), Q Link and Mr. Asad have ceased participation in any program administered by the FCC, and the Companies agree that Q Link and Mr. Asad will not participate in any such programs administered by the Commission in the future. Consistent with this representation, Q Link and Mr. Asad agree not to contest their suspensions and proposed debarments under the Suspension Notices and agree to waive all rights under the Commission's Rules to challenge the suspensions and proposed debarments. The Companies also warrant that upon execution of this Agreement, Quadrant, and all other related companies, affiliates or subsidiaries, and any other company in which Mr. Asad has a controlling ownership interest will

have ceased participating in any program administered by the FCC (including the receipt of any 
benefit associated with any such programs) and will not participate in such any programs administered by the FCC in the future.14 
In accordance with the Commission's debarment rules, Mr. Asad was required to file with the Commission any opposition to the suspension or its scope, or to the proposed debarment or its scope, no later than 30 calendar days from either the date of Mr. Asad's receipt of the Notice of Suspension or of its 
publication 
in the Federal Register, whichever date occurred first.15 
The Commission received no opposition from Mr. Asad and in fact Mr. Asad agreed in the Administrative Settlement not to contest the suspension or dcbarmcnt.16 
For the above reasons, Mr. Asad is debarred from involvement with the Lifoline program and any other program funded by federal universal service support mechanisms, as well as any other program administered by the FCC, as of the Debarment Date.17 
Mr. Asad is excluded from participating in any activities associated with or related to the Lifeline program or any other program administered by the FCC, including the receipt or funds or discounted services through the Lifeline program or any other program administered by the FCC, or consulting with, assisting, or advising applicants or service 
providers regarding any such programs.18 
After review of the record (including the terms of the 
Administrative Settlement) and due to the egregious nature of the fraudulent activities that led to Mr. Asad's criminal conviction, the Commission has determined that this debarment will be permanent. Sincerely yours, Christopher

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS 
COMMISSION 
[FR ID 294179] 
Privacy Act of 1974; Matching Program 
AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. 
ACTION: Notice; request for comments. SUMMARY: In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended 
(‘‘Privacy Act’’), this document 
announces a new computer matching 
program the Federal Communications 
Commission (‘‘FCC’’ or ‘‘Commission’’ 
or ‘‘Agency’’) and the Universal Service 
Administrative Company (USAC) will 
conduct with the Florida Department of 
Children and Families. The purpose of 
this matching program is to verify the 
eligibility of applicants to and 
subscribers of Lifeline, and the 
Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), 
both of which are administered by 
USAC under the direction of the FCC. 
DATES: Written comments are due on or before January 16, 2026. This computer 
matching program will commence on 
January 16, 2026, and will conclude 
after 18 months. 
ADDRESSES: Send comments to Shana Yates, Federal Communications 
Commission, 45 L Street NE, 
Washington, DC 20554, or to Privacy@
fcc.gov. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Shana Yates at (202) 418–0683 or 
Privacy@fcc.gov. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Lifeline program provides support for 
discounted broadband and voice 
services to low-income consumers. 
Lifeline is administered by the 
Universal Service Administrative 
Company (USAC) under FCC direction. 
Consumers qualify for Lifeline through 
proof of income or participation in a 
qualifying program, such as Medicaid, 
the Supplemental Nutritional 
Assistance Program (SNAP), Federal 
Public Housing Assistance, 
Supplemental Security Income (SSI), 
Veterans and Survivors Pension Benefit, 
or various Tribal-specific federal 
assistance programs. 
In the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, 2021, Public Law 116–260, 134 
Stat. 1182, 2129–36 (2020), Congress 
created the Emergency Broadband 
Benefit Program, and directed use of the 
National Verifier to determine eligibility 
based on various criteria, including the 
qualifications for Lifeline (Medicaid, 
SNAP, etc.). EBBP provided $3.2 billion 
in monthly consumer discounts for 
broadband service and one-time 
provider reimbursement for a connected 
device (laptop, desktop computer or 
tablet). In the Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act, Public Law 117–58, 135 
Stat. 429, 1238–44 (2021) (codified at 47 
U.S.C. 1751–52), Congress modified and 
extended EBBP, provided an additional 
$14.2 billion, and renamed it the 
Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). 
A household may qualify for the ACP 
benefit under various criteria, including 
an individual qualifying for the FCC’s 
Lifeline program. 
In a Report and Order adopted on 
March 31, 2016, (81 FR 33026, May 24, 
2016) (2016 Lifeline Modernization 
Order), the Commission ordered USAC 
to create a National Lifeline Eligibility 
Verifier (‘‘National Verifier’’), including 
the National Lifeline Eligibility Database 
(LED), that would match data about 
Lifeline applicants and subscribers with 
other data sources to verify the 
eligibility of an applicant or subscriber. 
The Commission found that the 
National Verifier would reduce 
compliance costs for Lifeline service 
providers, improve service for Lifeline 
subscribers, and reduce waste, fraud, 
and abuse in the program. 
The Consolidated Appropriations Act 
of 2021 directs the FCC to leverage the 
National Verifier to verify applicants’ 
eligibility for ACP. The purpose of this 
matching program is to verify the 
eligibility of Lifeline and ACP 
applicants and subscribers by 
determining whether they receive SNAP 
and Medicaid benefits administered by 
the Florida Department of Children and 
Families. 
Participating Agencies 
Florida Department of Children and 
Families (source agency); Federal 
Communications Commission (recipient 
agency); and Universal Service 
Administrative Company. 
Authority for Conducting the Matching 
Program 
The authority to conduct the 
matching program for the FCC’s ACP is 
47 U.S.C. 1752(a) and (b). The authority 
to conduct the matching program for the 
FCC’s Lifeline program is 47 U.S.C. 
254(a) through (c), (j). 
Purpose(s) 
The purpose of this new matching 
agreement is to verify the eligibility of 
applicants and subscribers to Lifeline, 
as well as to ACP and other Federal 
programs that use qualification for 
Lifeline as an eligibility criterion. This 
new agreement will permit eligibility 
verification for the Lifeline program and 
ACP by checking an applicant’s/ 
subscriber’s participation in SNAP and 
Medicaid in Florida. Under FCC rules, 
consumers receiving these benefits 
qualify for Lifeline discounts and also 
for ACP benefits. 
Categories of Individuals 
The categories of individuals whose 
information is involved in the matching 
program include, but are not limited to, 
those individuals who have applied for 
Lifeline and/or ACP benefits; are 
currently receiving Lifeline and/or ACP 
benefits; are individuals who enable 
another individual in their household to 
qualify for Lifeline and/or ACP benefits; 
are minors whose status qualifies a 
parent or guardian for Lifeline and/or 
ACP benefits; or are individuals who 
have received Lifeline and/or ACP 
benefits. 
Categories of Records 
The categories of records involved in 
the matching program include the last 
four digits of the applicant’s Social 
Security Number, date of birth, first and 
last name. The National Verifier will 
transfer these data elements to the 
Florida Department of Children and 
Families which will respond either 
‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ that the individual is 
enrolled in a qualifying assistance 
program: SNAP and Medicaid 
administered by the Florida Department 
of Children and Families. 
System(s) of Records 
The records shared as part of this 
matching program reside in the Lifeline 
system of records, FCC/WCB–1, 
Lifeline, which was published in the 
Federal Register at 89 FR 28777 (Apr. 
19, 2024). 
The records shared as part of this 
matching program reside in the ACP

Title: Rule Concerning Disclosure of Written Consumer Product Warranty 
Terms and Conditions, 16 CFR part 701. 
OMB Control Number: 3084–0111. 
Type of Review: Extension of a 
currently approved collection. 
Abstract: The Warranty Rule is one of three rules
1
that the FTC implemented 
pursuant to requirements of the 
Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 
U.S.C. 2301 et seq. (Warranty Act or 
Act).
2
The Warranty Rule specifies the 
information that must appear in a 
written warranty on a consumer 
product
3
costing more than $15. The 
Rule tracks Section 102(a) of the 
Warranty Act,
4
specifying information 
that must appear in the written warranty 
and, for certain disclosures, mandates 
the exact language that must be used.
5
 
Neither the Warranty Rule nor the Act 
requires that a manufacturer or retailer 
warrant a consumer product in writing, 
but if they choose to do so, the warranty 
must comply with the Rule. 
Estimated Annual Hours Burden: 
209,048 hours. 
Estimated Annual Labor Cost Burden: 
$28,977,188. 
As required by Section 3506(c)(2)(A) 
of the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A), the 
FTC is providing this opportunity for 
public comment before requesting that 
OMB extend the existing clearance for 
the information collection requirements 
contained in the Warranty Rule. 
Burden Statement 
Total annual hours burden: 209,048 
hours. 
In its 2022 submission to OMB, the 
FTC estimated that the information 
collection burden of including the 
disclosures required by the Warranty 
Rule was 216,752 hours per year. 
Although the Rule’s information 
collection requirements have not 
changed, the current estimate decreases 
the number of manufacturers subject to 
the Rule based on recent Census data.
6
 
Further, because most warrantors likely 
would continue to disclose the 
information required by the Rule, even 
if there were no statute or rule requiring 
them to do so, staff’s estimates likely 
overstate the PRA-related burden 
attributable to the Rule. Moreover, the 
Warranty Rule has been in effect since 
1976, and warrantors have long since 
modified their warranties to include the 
information the Rule requires. 
Based on conversations with various 
warrantors’ representatives over the 
years, staff has concluded that eight 
hours per year is a reasonable estimate 
of warrantors’ PRA-related burden 
attributable to the Warranty Rule. This 
estimate includes the number of hours 
warrantors may need to ensure new 
warranties and any changes to existing 
warranties comply with the Rule. Based 
on recent Census data, staff now 
estimates that there are 26,131

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES58558 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Notices 7
Because some manufacturers likely make 
products that are not priced above $15 or not 
intended for household use—and thus would not be 
subject to the Rule—this figure is likely an 
overstatement. 
8
Staff has derived an hourly wage rate for legal 
professionals based upon industry knowledge. The 
hourly wage rates for legal support workers and for 
clerical support are based on mean hourly wages 
available at https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ 
ocwage.htm (‘‘Occupational Employment and Wages—May 2024,’’ U.S. Department of Labor, 
released April 2, 2025, Table 1 (‘‘National 
employment and wage data from the Occupational 
Employment Statistics survey by occupation, May 
2024’’). 
manufacturers covered by the Rule.
7
 
This results in an annual burden 
estimate of approximately 209,048 
hours (26,131 manufacturers × 8 hours of burden per year). 
Total annual labor costs: $28,977,188. 
Labor costs are derived by applying 
appropriate hourly cost figures to the 
burden hours described above. The 
work required to comply with the 
Warranty Rule—ensuring that new 
warranties and changes to existing 
warranties comply with the Rule— 
requires a mix of legal analysis (50%), 
legal support (paralegals) (25%) and 
clerical help (25%). Staff estimates that 
half of the total burden hours (104,524 
hours) requires legal analysis at an 
average hourly wage of $250 for legal 
professionals,
8
resulting in a labor cost 
of $26,131,000. Assuming that 25% of 
the total burden hours requires legal 
support at the average hourly wage of 
$32.60, and that the remaining 25% 
requires clerical work at an average 
hourly wage of $21.86, the resulting 
labor cost is approximately $2,846,188 
($1,703,741 + $1,142,447). Thus, the 
total annual labor cost is approximately 
$28,977,188 ($26,131,000 for legal 
professionals + $1,703,741 for legal 
support + $1,142,447 for clerical 
workers). 
Total Capital and Start-Up Costs 
The Rule imposes no appreciable 
current capital or start-up costs that 
businesses do not already spend in the 
normal course of business. To comply 
with the Warranty Rule, warrantors 
need only the ordinary office equipment 
to draft new warranties and to change 
the wording of existing warranties to 
include the required disclosures. Thus, 
compliance requires no capital 
equipment or special technology apart 
from what the manufacturer or seller 
would already be using as part of the 
normal course of business, such as 
computer or other word processing 
equipment, and photocopying 
equipment. Similarly, distribution of the 
warranty does not impose any special 
capital costs apart from the packaging 
and printing equipment already in use 
by the business. It is not possible to 
state with any precision what fraction of 
the cost of that equipment could be 
attributed to distributing the warranty. 
Total Operation/Maintenance/Purchase 
of Services Costs 
The only ongoing costs involved with 
compliance are those costs associated 
with maintenance and repair of 
computer word processing and 
photocopying equipment used to 
generate the warranty document that 
contains the required disclosures. These 
are costs that the seller or manufacturer 
already bears in the normal cost of 
business; it is unlikely that Warranty 
Rule compliance would impose 
significant incremental costs. Likewise, 
the cost of distributing warranty 
information involves such things as the 
purchase of supplies (such as paper), 
the maintenance of equipment, or the 
purchase of services to print, package, 
and distribute the warranty. These are 
costs that would be already built into 
the packaging and distribution of the 
product itself and which are already 
assumed as part of the normal course of 
business. 
Request for Comments 
Pursuant to Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of 
the PRA, the FTC invites comments on: 
(1) whether the information collection 
requirements are necessary, including 
whether the information will be 
practically useful; (2) the accuracy of 
our burden estimates, including 
whether the methodology and 
assumptions used are valid; (3) ways to 
enhance the quality, utility, and clarity 
of the information to be collected; and 
(4) ways to minimize the burden of the 
collection of information. 
For the FTC to consider a comment,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
A. Purpose 
This information collection is for GSA 
Federal Supply Schedules (FSS) offerors 
and contractors subject to certain 
pricing disclosures and sales reporting 
requirements (i.e. referred to as CSP/ PRC requirements). CSP/PRC 
requirements are found within the basic 
version of General Services 
Administration Acquisition Regulation 
(GSAR) clause 552.238–80, Industrial 
Funding Fee and Sales Reporting and 
the basic version of GSAR clause 
552.238–81, Price Reductions; GSAR 
section 515.408(b) and (c); GSAR clause 
552.238–83 Examination of Records by 
GSA; GSAR clause 552.238–85, 
Contractor’s Billing Responsibilities; 
and GSAR clause 552.238–120, 
Economic Price Adjustment—Federal 
Supply Schedule Contracts. This 
information collection does not apply to 
GSA FSS offerors and contractors 
subject to Transactional Data Reporting 
(TDR) requirements. The burden 
associated with TDR requirements is 
covered under information collection 
OMB control number 3090–0306, 
Transactional Data Reporting. 
B. Annual Reporting Burden 
The total estimated annual public cost 
burden and total estimated annual 
public burden hours for this information 
collection is estimated to be: 
Year 1  Year 2  Year 3 
$84,629,455 
935,622 
$0 Cost 
0 hours 
$0 Cost 
0 hours 
These estimates are calculated by 
adding up the total estimated annual 
burden cost/hour for each of the GSAR 
clauses covered by this information 
collection. Additionally, these estimates 
take into account the following impacts: 
1. During the renewal period of this 
information collection FSS offerors and 
contractors will no longer be subject to 
the aforementioned CSP/PRC 
requirements and instead will be 
covered by TDR requirements. The 
transition to TDR is based on Class 
Deviation CD–2025–13, Revised 
Transactional Data Reporting (TDR) 
Requirements for the Federal Supply 
Schedule (FSS) Program, which was 
issued on June 26, 2025. The class 
deviation (CD) amends the GSAR to 
remove CSP/PRC and make TDR 
requirements mandatory for the FSS 
program. 
As a result of this CD— 
a. The FSS solicitation will be 
amended to remove CSP/PRC 
requirements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
A. Purpose 
The General Services Administration 
Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) 
552.236–79, Construction-Contractor-as- 
Constructor, requires the contractor to 
submit a proposal to establish the final 
estimated cost of the work, to convert 
the contract to a firm-fixed-price, and to 
determine the final settlement for 
construction-manager-as-constructor 
(CMc) projects. 
The CMc refers to a project 
management and contracting technique 
that is one of three predominant 
methods used for acquiring construction 
services by GSA. The other two methods 
are design-bid-build and design-build. 
The private sector commonly uses a

method, which allows for early industry 
engagement by the construction 
contractor to enable reduced cost 
growth, reduced schedule growth, and 
administrative savings. 
The information is used by 
contracting officers to evaluate 
proposals and negotiate contract 
modifications during contract 
administration. This collection supports 
the Government’s shift toward category 
management by providing a more robust 
playbook framework for efficient 
procurement of construction services. 
B. Annual Reporting Burden 
Total public reporting burden for this 
collection of information is estimated to 
average 400 total hours ($33,300) 
annually, including the time for 
reviewing instructions, searching 
existing data sources, gathering, and 
maintaining the data needed, and 
completing and reviewing the collection 
of information. The estimated burden 
hours to the public for the below clauses 
are as follows: 
GSAR 552.236–79, Construction- 
Contractor-as-Constructor, requires the 
contractor to submit a proposal to 
establish the final estimated cost of the 
work, to convert the contract to a firm- 
fixed-price, and to determine the final 
settlement. 
Respondents: 10. Responses per Respondent: 1. 
Total Annual Responses: 10. 
Hours per Response: 40. 
Total Response Burden Hours: 400. 
Cost per Hour: $83.25. 
Estimated Cost Burden to the Public: 
$33,300. 
GSAR 552.236–80, Accounting 
Records, contains a recordkeeping 
requirement that is subject to the 
Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 
3501, et seq.). The clause requires the contractor to keep all relevant 
documents for a period of three years 
after the final payment. However, the 
clause does not add burden to what is 
already estimated for the existing FAR 
clause at 52.215–2, Audit and Records 
by a previous information collection 
(see OMB Control Number 9000–0034).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
A. Purpose 
This information collection is for GSA 
Federal Supply Schedules (FSS) and 
non-FSS offerors and contractors subject 
to transactional data report (TDR) 
requirements. Transactional data 
encompasses the historical details of the 
products or services delivered by a 
contractor during the performance of 
task or delivery orders issued against a 
contract subject to TDR requirements. 
TDR requirements are found within 
Alternate I of General Services 
Administration Acquisition Regulation 
(GSAR) clause 552.238–80, Industrial 
Funding Fee and Sales Reporting; 
552.216–75, Transactional Data 
Reporting; Alternate I of 552.238–81, 
Price Reductions; 552.238–83 
Examination of Records by GSA; 
552.238–85, Contractor’s Billing 
Responsibilities; and 552.238–120, 
Economic Price Adjustment—Federal 
Supply Schedule Contracts. This 
information collection does not apply to 
GSA FSS offerors and contractors 
subject to pricing disclosures and sales 
reporting requirements. The burden 
associated with pricing disclosures and 
sales reporting requirements is covered 
under information collection OMB 
control number 3090–0235, Federal 
Supply Schedule Pricing Disclosures 
and Sales Reporting. 
B. Annual Reporting Burden 
The total estimated annual public cost 
burden and total estimated annual 
public burden hours for this information 
collection is estimated to be: 
Year 1 Years 2 & 3 $121,766,340 Cost 
1,553,495 hour 
$69,731,624 Cost 
1,044,217 hours 
The reason Year 1 numbers are higher 
than Years 2 & 3 numbers is due to the 
transition of existing FSS non-TDR 
contracts to TDR during Year 1 of this 
renewal period. 
These estimates are calculated by 
adding up the total estimated annual 
burden cost/hour for each of the GSAR 
clauses covered by this information 
collection. Additionally, these estimates 
take into account the following impacts: 
1. During the renewal period of this 
information collection, all FSS offerors 
and contractors will fall under TDR (i.e., 
FSS offerors and contractors will no 
longer be subject to the aforementioned 
pricing disclosures and sales reporting 
requirements). The transition to TDR is 
based on Class Deviation CD–2025–13, 
Revised Transactional Data Reporting 
(TDR) Requirements for the Federal 
Supply Schedule (FSS) Program, which 
was issued on June 26, 2025. The class 
deviation (CD) amends the GSAR to 
remove certain pricing disclosures and 
sales reporting requirements and makes 
TDR requirements mandatory for the 
FSS program. As a result of this CD, 
a. The FSS solicitation will be 
amended to remove pricing disclosures 
and sales reporting requirements. 
b. Existing FSS contractors will need 
to transition to TDR. GSA anticipates 
the transition to be completed by the 
end of Year 1 of this renewal period. 
2. Alternate I of GSAR clause 
552.216–70, Economic Price 
Adjustment—FSS Multiple Award 
Schedule Contract, was replaced by 
GSAR clause 552.238–120, Economic 
Price Adjustment—Federal Supply 
Schedule Contracts. This new clause is 
less burdensome than the prior clause 
and provides more flexibility. 
Burden Cost/Hour Calculation 
The following provides the basis for 
calculating the burden cost/hour for 
GSA clauses 552.216–75, and Alternate

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES58561 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Notices I of GSAR clause 552.238–80. These 
calculations account for the 
aforementioned transition to TDR 
during this renewal period. 
Initial Setup: 
Æ Estimated hourly rate & job position equivalency. The estimated hourly cost 
associated with this task is based on the 
task being accomplished by senior level 
personnel equivalent to a GS–14, Step 5 
employee. A GS–14, Step 5 employee 
hourly rate for 2025 is $92.15 (‘‘Rest of 
U.S.’’ locality using OPM Salary Table 
2025–RUS, Effective January 2025). 
Æ Estimated hours by system for initial set-up. A contractor complying 
with TDR requirements will absorb a 
one-time setup burden for purposes of 
establishing a reporting system (i.e., 
automated reporting system vs. manual 
reporting system). The estimated setup 
time varies between automated and 
manual reporting systems. GSA 
estimates the average one-time initial 
setup burden is 10 hours for a manual 
system and 245 hours for an automated 
system. 
Monthly Reporting: 
Æ Estimated hourly rate & job position equivalency. The estimated hourly cost 
associated with this task is based on the 
task being accomplished by mid-level 
personnel equivalent to a GS–12, Step 5 
employee. A GS–12, Step 5 employee 
hourly rate for 2022 is $65.58 (i.e., using ‘‘Rest of U.S.’’ locality within the OPM 
Salary Table for 2022–RUS, Effective 
January 2025). 
Æ Categorization of contractors by sales revenue. GSA estimates the 
likelihood of contractors with lower to 
no reportable sales will spend relatively 
little time on reporting. In contrast, 
contractors with more reportable sales 
will face a higher reporting burden. To 
account for this difference, GSA is using 
the below sales revenue categories: 
Category 1: No sales activity/revenue 
(i.e., $0.00) Category 2: Sales between $0.01 and 
$25,000.00 
Category 3: Sales between $25,000.01 
and $250,000.00 
Category 4: Sales between $250,000.01 
and $1 million 
Category 5: Sales over $1 million 
Æ Automated system vs. manual reporting system. GSA estimates the 
likelihood of a contractor creating an 
automated reporting system increases 
with a contractor’s sales revenue. In 
contrast, contractors with little to no 
sales revenue are unlikely to expend the 
effort needed to establish an automated 
reporting system. To account for this 
difference, GSA is using the below table. 
The below table shows by sales revenue 
category the estimated percentage of the 
likelihood of a contractor using a 
manual reporting system vs automated 
reporting system:

revenue category. GSA estimates that 
the monthly reporting time varies by 
type of reporting system (i.e., manual or automated) and by respective sales 
revenue category. The below table 
shows GSA’s estimated monthly 
reporting times per sales revenue 
category and system type:

the record keeping requirement 
contained in this clause does not add 
any additional burden to what is already 
captured by Alternate I of GSAR clause 
552.238–80, which is covered by this 
information collection.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Proposed Project 
Online Submission Form for 
Supplemental Evidence and Data for 
Systematic Reviews for the Evidence- 
Based Practice 
AHRQ’s EPC Program develops 
evidence reports on topics relevant to 
clinical and other health care 
organization and delivery issues— 
specifically those that are common, 
expensive, and/or significant for the 
Medicare and Medicaid populations. 
For example, recent reviews have 
focused on clinical conditions, such as 
‘‘Cervical Degenerative Disease 
Treatment: A Systematic Review’’; 
health delivery topics such as 
‘‘Postpartum Care up to 1 Year After 
Pregnancy: A Systematic Review and 
Meta-Analysis’’; and specific 
technologies such as ‘‘Blood-Based 
Tests for Multiple Cancer Screening: A 
Systematic Review.’’ These evidence 
reports include systematic reviews, 
technical briefs, and rapid reviews, and 
provide an essential foundation from 
which to understand what we know 
from existing research and what critical 
research gaps remain. These reports and 
reviews are based on rigorous, 
comprehensive syntheses and analyses 
of the scientific literature on topics. EPC 
reports and assessments emphasize 
explicit and detailed documentation of 
methods, rationale, and assumptions. 
EPC reports are conducted in 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:40 Dec 16, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\17DEN1.SGM 17DEN1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES58563 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Notices accordance with an established policy 
on financial and nonfinancial interests. 
These scientific syntheses may include 
meta-analyses. 
The EPC Program supports AHRQ’s 
mission by synthesizing and 
disseminating the available research as 
a ‘‘science partner’’ with private and 
public organizations in their efforts to 
improve the quality, effectiveness, and 
appropriateness of health care. The EPC 
Program is a trusted source of rigorous, 
comprehensive, and unbiased evidence 
reviews for stakeholders. The resulting 
evidence reports are used by Federal 
and State agencies, private-sector 
professional societies, health delivery 
systems, providers, payers, and others 
committed to evidence-based health 
care. These end-users may use EPC 
Program evidence reports to inform 
policy decisions, clinical practice 
guidelines, and other healthcare 
decisions. 
AHRQ requests that OMB approve the 
renewal, without change, of the ‘‘Online 
Submission Form for Supplemental 
Evidence and Data for Systematic 
Reviews for the Evidence-based 
Practice’’ (OMB No. 0935–0231, last 
approved on November 22, 2022). 
This activity, Online Submission 
Form for Supplemental Evidence and 
Data for Systematic Reviews for the 
Evidence-based Practice Center 
Program, seeks to answer the following 
research question: 
1. Are there research studies or other 
information that can promote the 
comprehensiveness of AHRQ Evidence- 
based Practice Center Program evidence 
reviews? 
This research has the following goals: 
1. Use research methods to gather 
knowledge on the effectiveness and 
harms of certain treatments and 
healthcare delivery processes and 
models for medical conditions, both 
published and unpublished, to evaluate 
the quality of research studies and the 
evidence from these studies. 
2. Promote the use of evidence in 
healthcare decision making to improve 
healthcare and health. 
3. Identify research gaps to inform 
future research investments. 
This study is being conducted by 
AHRQ through its contractor, Portland 
VA Research Foundation, with website 
assistance from another contractor, Riva 
Solutions, pursuant to AHRQ’s statutory 
authority to conduct and support 
research on health care and on systems 
for the delivery of such care, including 
activities with respect to the quality, 
effectiveness, efficiency, 
appropriateness and value of healthcare 
services and with respect to quality 
measurement and improvement [42 
U.S.C 299a(a)(1) and (2)]. 
Method of Collection 
To achieve the goals of this project the 
following data collection will be 
implemented: 
€Online Submission Form. This information is collected for the purposes 
of providing supplemental evidence and 
data for systematic reviews (SEADS). 
The online submission form (OSF) 
collects data from respondents on their 
name, organization name, description of 
the submission, medical condition, 
intervention, and email address. For the 
purposes of meta-analyses, trial 
summary data from missing and 
unidentified studies are sought. For the 
purposes of constructing evidence tables 
and quality ratings (e.g., on public reporting of cost measures or health 
information exchange), data can vary 
(e.g., URLs, study designs, and consumer-mediated exchange forms). 
Information on both completed and 
ongoing studies are requested. 
Submitters may alternatively email their 
submission to the AHRQ EPC mailbox at 
epc@ahrq.hhs.gov. 
The EPC Program currently uses 
broad-based email announcement to 
stakeholders and through AHRQ 
listservs, and in some cases an 
additional Federal Register notice to allow the public to know about each 
topic, and the opportunity to submit 
scientific information. AHRQ plans to 
conduct one SEADS collection per 
topic. Up to twenty-four topics per year 
with SEADS portals are anticipated; 
over the past 3 years the number of 
SEADS portals has ranged from 10–19; 
with an average range of 0–11 potential 
respondents per topic. The EPC Program 
does not anticipate more than 40 topics 
per year with SEADS portals. 
Estimated Annual Respondent Burden 
Exhibit 1 presents estimates of the 
reporting burden hours for the data 
collection efforts. Time estimates are 
based on pilot testing of materials and 
what can reasonably be requested of 
respondents. The number of 
respondents listed in ‘‘Number of 
respondents’’ of Exhibit 1 reflects a 
projected upper range response rate per 
SEADS portal multiplied by the 
anticipated upper limit of number of 
SEADS portals per year, based on 
historical information over the past 3 
years. The total burden is estimated to 
be 50 hours.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Proposed Project 
Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality’s (AHRQ) Child Hospital 
Consumer Assessment of Healthcare 
Providers and Systems (Child HCAHPS) 
Survey Database 
The Child HCAHPS survey assesses 
the experiences of pediatric patients 
(less than 18 years old) and their parents 
or guardians with inpatient care. It 
complements the CAHPS Adult 
Hospital Survey (HCAHPS), which asks 
adult inpatients about their experiences. 
The Child HCAHPS Survey Database is 
a voluntary database available to all 
Child HCAHPS users to support both 
quality improvement and research to 
enhance the patient-centeredness of care 
delivered to pediatric hospital patients. 
AHRQ requests that OMB approve the 
reinstatement, without change, of 
AHRQ’s collection of information for 
the Child HCAHPS Survey Database 
(OMB Control number 0935–0243, last 
approved on October 12, 2022). 
Like the survey instrument itself and 
related toolkit materials to support 
survey implementation, aggregated 
Child HCAHPS Survey Database results 
will be made publicly available on 
AHRQ’s CAHPS website. Technical 
assistance will be provided by AHRQ 
through its contractor at no charge to 
hospitals to facilitate the access and use 
of these materials for quality 
improvement and research. Technical 
assistance is also provided to support 
Child HCAHPS data submission. 
The Child HCAHPS Survey Database 
supports AHRQ’s goals of promoting 
improvements in the quality and 
patient-centeredness of health care in 
pediatric hospital settings. 
This research seeks to answer the 
following research questions: 
1. What are the key drivers of patient 
experience in pediatric settings? 
2. How do pediatric patients 
experience of care vary across the West, 
Midwest, South, and Northeast regions? 
3. What are the highest and lowest 
scoring measures in specific areas of 
care for pediatric hospitals? 
This research has the following goals: 
1. Improve care provided by 
individual hospitals and hospital 
systems. 
2. Offer several products and services, 
including providing survey results 
presented through summary chartbooks, 
custom analyses, private reports and 
data for research purposes. 
3. Provides information to help 
identify strengths and areas with 
potential for improvement in patient 
care. 
Survey data from the Child HCAHPS 
Survey Database will be used to produce 
two types of reporting products: 
€Hospital Feedback Reports. Hospitals that submit data will have 
access to a customized report that 
presents findings for their individual 
submission along with results from the 
database overall. These ‘‘private’’

sortable results for each of the Child 
HCAHPS core composite measures and

forms the composite measure. 
€Child HCAHPS Chartbook. A summary-level Chartbook will be 
compiled to display top box and other 
proportional scores for the Child 
HCAHPS items and composite measures 
broken out by selected hospital 
characteristics (e.g., region, hospital size, ownership and affiliation, etc.). 
This study is being conducted by 
AHRQ through its contractor, Westat, 
pursuant to AHRQ’s statutory authority 
to conduct and support research on 
health care and on systems for the 
delivery of such care, including 
activities with respect to the quality, 
effectiveness, efficiency, 
appropriateness and value of healthcare 
services; to quality measurement and 
improvement; and health surveys and 
database development [42 U.S.C 
299a(a)(1), (2), and (8)]. 
Method of Collection 
To achieve the goals of this project, 
the following data collections will be 
implemented: 
€Registration with the submission website to obtain an account with a 
secure username and password: The 
point-of-contact (POC), often the 
hospital, completes a number of data 
submission steps and forms, beginning 
with the completion of the online 
registration form. The purpose of this 
form is to collect basic contact 
information about the organization and 
initiate the registration process; 
€Submission of signed Data Use Agreements (DUAs) and survey 
questionnaires: The purpose of the data use agreement, completed by the 
participating hospital, is to state how 
data submitted by or on behalf of 
hospitals will be used and provide 
confidentiality assurances; 
€Submission of hospital information form: The purpose of this form, completed by the participating 
organization, is to collect background 
characteristics of the hospital; 
€Submission of survey data files: POCs upload their data file using the 
Hospital data file specifications to 
ensure that users submit standardized 
and consistent data in the way variables 
are named, coded, and formatted. 
Estimated Annual Respondent Burden 
Exhibit 1 shows the estimated burden 
hours for the respondent to participate 
in the database. The 54 POCs in Exhibit 
1 are a combination of an estimated 50 
hospitals that currently administer the 
Child HCAHPS survey and the four 
survey vendors assisting them. 
Each hospital will register online for 
submission. The online Registration 
form will require about five minutes to 
complete. Each submitter will also 
complete a hospital information form. 
The online hospital information form 
takes on average five minutes to 
complete. The DUA will be completed 
by each of the 50 participating hospitals. 
Survey vendors do not sign or submit 
DUAs. The DUAs are submitted by the 
participating hospitals and requires 
about three minutes to sign and upload 
to the online submission system. Each 
submitter, which in most cases will be 
the survey vendor performing the data 
collection, will provide a copy of their 
questionnaire and the survey data file in 
the required file format. Survey data 
files must conform to the data file layout 
specifications provided by the Child 
HCAHPS Survey Database. Since the 
unit of analysis is at the hospital level, 
submitters will upload one data file per 
hospital. Once a data file is uploaded, 
the file will be automatically checked to 
ensure it conforms to the specifications, 
and a data file status report will be 
produced and made available to the 
submitter. Submitters will review each 
report and will be expected to correct 
any errors in their data file and resubmit 
if necessary. It will take about one hour 
to submit the data for each hospital. The 
total burden is estimated to be 61 hours 
annually.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) 
(44 U.S.C. 3501–3520), federal agencies 
must obtain approval from the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) for each 
collection of information they conduct 
or sponsor. The term ‘‘collection of 
information’’ is defined in 44 U.S.C. 
3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) and 
includes agency requests or 
requirements that members of the public 
submit reports, keep records, or provide 
information to a third party. Section 
3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA (44 U.S.C. 
3506(c)(2)(A)) requires federal agencies 
to publish a 30-day notice in the 
Federal Register concerning each 
proposed collection of information, 
including each proposed extension or 
reinstatement of an existing collection 
of information, before submitting the 
collection to OMB for approval. To 
comply with this requirement, CMS is 
publishing this notice that summarizes 
the following proposed collection(s) of 
information for public comment. 
1. Type of Information Collection Request: Revision of a currently approved collection; Title of 
Information Collection: Requirement for 
Electronic Prescribing for Controlled 
Substances (EPCS) for a Covered Part D 
Drug Under a Prescription Drug Plan or 
an MA–PD Plan; Use: Section 2003 of the SUPPORT for Patients and 
Communities Act of 2018 requires that 
prescribing of a Schedule II, III, IV, and 
V controlled substance under Medicare 
Part D be done electronically in 
accordance with an electronic 
prescription drug program beginning 
January 1, 2021, subject to any 
exceptions, which HHS may specify. In 
the calendar year (CY) 2021 and 2022 
Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) final 
rules, CMS finalized the electronic 
prescribing for controlled substances 
(EPCS) requirements and exceptions at 
42 CFR 423.160(a)(5). Compliance for 
prescribers not in long-term care 
facilities begins in CY 2023. Compliance 
for prescribers in long-term care 
facilities begins in CY 2028. 
EPCS requirements do not require 
prescribers or pharmacies to submit 
additional data to CMS; however, CMS 
did finalize one exception that requires 
data collection. The EPCS exception, at 
§ 423.160(a)(5)(iii), requires a prescriber 
to apply for a waiver if the prescriber is 
unable to conduct EPCS due to 
circumstances beyond the prescriber’s 
control. This collection of information is 
necessary to provide adequate and 
timely exception from the EPCS 
requirements if the prescriber is unable 
to conduct EPCS due to circumstances 
beyond the prescriber’s control. Form 
Number: CMS–10834 (OMB control number: 0938–1455); Frequency:

Program Performance Analysis Study 
(PAS)(Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) #: 0970–0536; expiration date 
December 31, 2025). The goal of the 
study is to collect, analyze and report on 
performance measures data for the 
SRAE program. The purpose of the 
request is to continue the ongoing data 
collection and submission of the 
performance measures by SRAE grant 
recipients. Revisions are proposed to the 
current performance measures, for 
implementation in July 2026, to address 
feedback from grant recipients to 
simplify and clarify participant surveys 
and to ensure the measures meet FYSB 
data needs. 
DATES: Comments due January 16, 2026. OMB must decide about the collection 
of information between 30 and 60 days 
after publication of this document in the 
Federal Register. Therefore, a comment 
is best assured of having its full effect 
if OMB receives it within 30 days of 
publication. 
ADDRESSES: The public may view and comment on this information collection 
request at: https://www.reginfo.gov/

Identify all requests by the title of the 
information collection. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Description: The purpose of the SRAE program is to educate youth on how to 
voluntarily refrain from nonmarital 
sexual activity and prevent other youth 
risk behaviors. Data will continue to be 
used to determine if the SRAE grant 
recipients are meeting their programs’ 
mission and priorities. 
The SRAE performance measures are 
collected from SRAE grant recipients, 
program providers, and participants. 
The data include information on 
program structure, cost, and support for 
implementation; program attendance, 
reach, and dosage; the characteristics of 
youth involved in programming; youth 
sexual and other risky behavior prior to 
program participation; and youth sexual 
and other risky behavior intentions at 
program exit. The performance 
measures help the ACF program office 
and grant recipients to monitor and 
report on progress in implementing 
SRAE programs and inform technical 
assistance. 
Some of the performance measures 
data come from youth participants 
through surveys SRAE grant recipients 
administer at program entry and exit. 
There are separate versions of the entry 
and exit surveys for middle school 
youth, which exclude some of the more 
sensitive items that are included in the 
versions for high school and older 
youth. There is also a shorter version of 
the entry survey for programs 
conducting impact studies, to reduce 
the burden on participants in those 
programs who are likely responding to 
other surveys as part of their impact 
study. Although there was a version of 
the exit survey for programs conducting 
impact studies in the past, it was 
removed through the previous OMB 
request, and youth in these programs 
now complete the same version of the 
exit survey as other youth. 
For continuity, ACF proposes to use 
the currently approved materials 
through June 2026, after which revised 
versions of the performance measures 
would be implemented. This phased in 
approach will ease the transition for 
grant recipients by providing them with 
ample time for implementation and will 
allow for data consistency by not 
changing measures in the middle of a 
data collection year. The proposed 
revisions to the current performance 
measures address feedback from grant 
recipients to simplify and clarify 
participant surveys and ensure the 
measures meet FYSB data needs. The 
proposed revisions to the participant 
surveys were cognitively tested with 
program participants for clarity and to 
check burden estimates. The changes 
reduce the burden for completing the 
participant entry survey from 8 minutes 
to 5 minutes per response and the 
participant exit survey from 10 to 7 
minutes. Overall, we expect a 61 
percent reduction in the annual burden 
hours under this request compared to 
the previously approved annual burden. 
Respondents: General Departmental (GDSRAE), State (SSRAE), and 
Competitive (CSRAE) grant recipients, 
their subrecipients, and program 
participants.

Information Collection Request Title: 
Countermeasures Injury Compensation 
Program—OMB No. 0915–0334— 
Revision 
Abstract: This is a request for continued OMB approval of the 
information collection requirements for 
the Countermeasures Injury 
Compensation Program (CICP or 
Program). This request includes 
revisions to improve the efficiency of 
the information collection process and 
the quality of the information collected. 
The revisions streamline questions on 
the information collection documents 
and update CICP contact information. 
HRSA administers CICP in accordance 
with the Public Readiness and 
Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) 
and CICP regulations at 42 CFR part 
110. CICP is requesting continued 
approval for this information collection, 
which includes documents specified in 
CICP’s regulations (42 CFR part 110). 
The PREP Act authorized the 
establishment of the CICP and provides 
liability immunity to covered persons 
for claims of loss caused by, arising out 
of, relating to, or resulting from the 
administration or use of covered 
countermeasures for diseases, threats, 
and conditions identified in PREP Act 
declarations. The immunity extended in 
the PREP Act encourages the 
development, manufacture, testing, 
distribution, and administration/use of 
countermeasures (e.g., vaccine, medication, device) when a disease, 
health condition, or other threat to 
health constitutes a public health 
emergency, or there is a credible risk 
that it may in the future constitute such 
an emergency. 
Need and Proposed Use of the 
Information: CICP provides compensation to eligible individuals 
who suffer serious injuries or death 
directly caused by a covered 
countermeasure administered or used 
pursuant to a PREP Act Declaration or 
to their estates and/or to certain 
survivors. An individual who is an 
injured countermeasure recipient, the 
estate or survivor(s) of a deceased 
injured countermeasure recipient, or 
their representative is responsible for 
submitting the Request for Benefits 
(RFB) package, as well as the injured 
countermeasure recipient’s medical 
records and supporting documentation. 
Individuals can apply at any time, but 
eligibility for compensation is subject to 
meeting applicable filing deadlines and 
other requirements. 
To determine whether a requester is 
eligible for Program benefits 
(compensation) for a countermeasure 
injury, CICP staff must review the RFB 
package, which includes the following: 
(1) RFB Form and Supporting Medical 
Documentation: Submission of this RFB form and supporting medical 
documentation initiate the CICP claims 
review process. CICP assesses the RFB 
form and supporting medical 
documentation to gather required 
information about the requester, 
document the use or administration of 
a countermeasure, and obtain medical 
information about the countermeasure 
recipient. 
(2) Authorization for Use or 
Disclosure of Health Information Form 
(Authorization Form): The requester or 
representative, if applicable, completes 
the Authorization Form and gives 
medical providers permission to 
disclose the countermeasure recipient’s 
health information via medical records 
to CICP for the purpose of determining 
eligibility for CICP benefits.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES58569 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Notices (3) Additional Medical 
Documentation and Certification: 
During the eligibility review, CICP 
provides requesters with the 
opportunity to supplement their RFB 
package with additional medical records 
and supporting documentation before 
the Program makes a final decision. 
CICP may ask requesters and/or 
representatives to complete and sign a 
form indicating whether they intend to 
submit additional required 
documentation before the final 
determination of their case. After CICP 
makes a final decision on a case, there 
are no other opportunities for a 
requester or representative to submit 
additional medical records or 
supporting documents. 
(4) Supporting Benefits 
Documentation: A requester who is an injured countermeasure recipient may 
be eligible to receive benefits for 
unreimbursed medical expenses and/or 
lost employment income. The estate of 
a deceased injured countermeasure 
recipient may also be eligible to receive 
payment for unreimbursed medical 
expenses and/or lost employment 
income accrued before the injured 
countermeasure recipient’s death. 
Requesters seeking such benefits must 
submit documentation of the injured 
countermeasure recipient’s 
unreimbursed medical expenses and 
lost employment income. If the 
administration or use of a covered 
countermeasure directly caused an 
individual’s death, certain of the 
individual’s survivors may be eligible to 
receive a death benefit, but not 
unreimbursed medical expenses or lost 
employment income benefits (42 CFR 
110.33). Survivors or their 
representatives must submit additional 
information, such as a marriage license, 
to prove that they are a survivor of the 
deceased countermeasure recipient. 
The RFB package instructions outline 
the supporting documentation needed 
to determine the type and amount of 
benefits. This documentation is required 
under 42 CFR 110.60–110.63 to enable 
the Program to determine the type and 
amount of benefits the requester may be 
eligible to receive. 
Likely Respondents: Countermeasure 
recipients, their estates, survivors, and/ 
or their representatives, are the most 
likely respondents to this Federal 
Register notice regarding the CICP information collection request because 
CICP reviews and, if eligible, 
compensates countermeasure recipient 
injury claims. 
Burden Statement: Burden in this 
context means the time expended by 
persons to generate, maintain, retain, 
disclose, or provide the information 
requested. This includes the time 
needed to review instructions; to 
develop, acquire, install, and utilize 
technology and systems for the purpose 
of collecting, validating, and verifying 
information, processing and 
maintaining information, and disclosing

Information Collection Request Title: 
Shortage Designation Management 
System OMB No. 0906–0029— 
Extension. 
Abstract: HRSA is committed to improving the health of the Nation’s 
underserved communities and 
vulnerable populations by developing, 
implementing, evaluating, and refining 
programs that strengthen the nation’s 
health workforce. The Department of 
Health and Human Services relies on 
two federal shortage designations to 
identify and dedicate resources to areas 
and populations in greatest need of 
providers: Health Professional Shortage 
Area (HPSA) designations and 
Medically Underserved Area/Medically 
Underserved Population (MUA/P) 
designations. HPSA designations are 
geographic areas, population groups, 
and facilities that are experiencing a 
shortage of health professionals. The 
authorizing statute for the National 
Health Service Corps (NHSC) created 
HPSAs to fulfill the statutory 
requirement that NHSC personnel be 
directed to areas of greatest need. To 
further differentiate areas of greatest 
need, HRSA calculates a score for each 
HPSA. There are three categories of 
HPSAs based on health discipline: 
primary care, dental health, and mental 
health. Scores range from 1 to 25 for 
primary care and mental health and 
from 1 to 26 for dental health, with 
higher scores indicating greater need. 
They are used to prioritize applications 
for NHSC Loan Repayment Program 
award funding and determine service 
sites eligible to receive NHSC 
Scholarship and Students-to-Service 
participants. 
MUA/P designations are geographic 
areas, or population groups within 
geographic areas, that are experiencing 
a shortage of primary care health care 
services based on the Index of Medical 
Underservice. MUAs are designated for 
the entire population of a particular 
geographic area. MUP designations are 
limited to a particular subset of the 
population within a geographic area. 
Both designations were created to aid 
the federal government in identifying 
areas with healthcare workforce 
shortages. 
As part of HRSA’s Bureau of Health 
Workforce’s cooperative agreement with 
the state primary care offices (PCOs), the 
state PCOs conduct needs assessments 
in their states, determine what areas are 
eligible for designations, and submit 
designation applications for HRSA 
review via the Shortage Designation 
Management System (SDMS). Requests 
that come from other sources are 
referred to the PCOs for their review, 
concurrence, and submission via SDMS. 
To obtain a federal shortage designation 
for an area, population, or facility, PCOs 
must submit a shortage designation 
application through SDMS for review 
and approval by HRSA. Both HPSA and 
MUA/P applications request local, state, 
and national data on the population that 
is experiencing a shortage of health 
professionals and the number of health 
professionals relative to the population 
covered by the proposed designation. 
The information collected on the 
applications is used to determine which 
areas, populations, and facilities have 
qualifying shortages. 
In addition, interested parties, 
including the state’s governor, primary 
care association, and professional 
associations are notified of each 
designation request submitted via SDMS 
for their comments and 
recommendations. 
HRSA reviews the HPSA applications 
submitted by the state PCOs, and—if 
they meet the designation eligibility 
criteria for the type of HPSA or MUA/ 
P the application is for—designates the 
HPSA or MUA/P on behalf of the 
Secretary of Health and Human 
Services. HPSAs are statutorily required 
to be annually reviewed and revised as 
necessary after initial designation to 
reflect current data. HPSA scores, 
therefore, may and do change from time 
to time. MUA/Ps do not have a 
statutorily mandated review period. 
The lists of designated HPSAs are 
published annually in the Federal 
Register. In addition, lists of HPSAs are 
updated on the HRSA website (https:// 
data.hrsa.gov/) so that interested parties 
can access the information. 
A 60-day notice was published in the 
Federal Register on May 19, 2025, vol. 
90, No. 95; pp. 21318–19. There were 51 
public comments. Below is a summary 
of key themes raised in the comments 
and HRSA’s response: 
The public comments HRSA received 
largely centered around two key themes: 
(1) the essential role of MUA/P and 
HPSA designations in supporting 
community health centers (CHCs), and 
(2) the administrative burden and data 
integrity challenges involved in shortage 
designation processes. 
€A total of 36 commenters— including CHCs, state associations, and 
national organizations emphasized that 
these designations are critical for 
funding, workforce recruitment 
(especially through the NHSC), 
expansion of services, and addressing 
broader impacts on health outcomes, 
such as food and pharmacy deserts. 
Many stressed that without these 
designations, CHCs would face severe 
operational and financial strain, leading 
to reduced access and worsened 
disparities. HRSA acknowledged these 
concerns, reaffirming the importance of 
these designations, and its recognition 
of their role in improving health 
outcomes and supporting safety-net 
providers. 
€Another 12 commenters, especially from State Primary Care Offices, and 
technical organizations, focused on 
underestimation of administrative 
burden and technical challenges with 
the SDMS system. They highlighted that 
HRSA’s estimated eight-hour workload 
was unrealistically low, pointing 
instead to much higher demands for 
provider updates, data acquisition, and 
reconciliation. Suggestions included 
integrating federal datasets (e.g., 
Medicaid, CDC, NSDUH), improving 
SDMS functionality (geocoding, 
duplicate checks, provider exit 
tracking), and providing clearer federal 
guidance. HRSA acknowledged these 
concerns, agreed that accurate data and 
system performance are critical, and 
committed to reviewing burden 
estimates, pursuing automation and 
integration of federal datasets, and 
exploring system enhancements. 
However, HRSA also noted that certain 
structural changes (e.g., adjusting population thresholds or adopting new 
designation methodologies) would 
require regulatory action through formal 
rulemaking. 
€Finally, 3 commenters offered more targeted recommendations, such as 
adopting the ADA Dental Care 
Geographic Accessibility Dashboard, 
revising population thresholds, or 
grandfathering existing designations. 
HRSA expressed appreciation for these 
suggestions and noted that while it is 
open to considering alternatives, such 
changes would require formal regulatory 
updates before implementation. 
Need and Proposed Use of the 
Information: The information obtained from the SDMS applications is used to 
determine which areas, populations, 
and facilities have critical shortages of 
health professionals per PCO 
application submission. The SDMS 
HPSA and MUA/P applications are used 
for these designation determinations. 
Applicants must have an SDMS 
application submitted to HRSA to 
obtain a federal shortage designation. In 
addition, the application must contain 
detailed information explaining how the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This collection was previously approved 
with changes on October 31, 2024. In 
the previous 60-day FRN ICE 
announced that it amended the Tip Line 
form with additional drop downs to 
make it easier for individuals to fill out 
the form. There was always a separate 
drop down for Law Enforcement 
Officers (LEOs), but it led to a free text 
box to supply the necessary 
information. With more LEOs providing 
information, ICE realized it needed 
more precise information to be able to 
process the tips provided. Therefore, 
ICE has added new fields that enables 
LEOs to provide all of the information 
needed by ICE without having to worry 
about remembering to put all that 
information into a free text field. ICE 
requested emergency approval of these 
changes from OMB on December 5, 
2025, and received a temporary six- 
month approval, which expires June 30, 
2026, during which time the agency can 
conduct the normal notice and comment 
PRA process. This notice is the first step 
in that process. The information is 
collected from members of the public 
and law enforcement partners who 
provide it using a fill-in-the-blank form

organic materials. The site 22QU518 has 
been collected by several different 
individuals and groups over an 
unknown period of years. MDAH has a 
collection from a 1981 survey 
conducted by the institution. A 
collection from Ruth Cheirs was 
donated to MDAH by Dr. Burnham in 
2003. Dr. Burnham also had his own 
personal collection from the site that 
was collected in the late 1970s and early 
1980s that was donated to MDAH. Burt 
Jaegar also collected artifacts from the 
site in the 1980s which were donated to 
MDAH. Other individuals donated their 
collections from this site with most 
lacking provenience information. These 
individual collectors include Tom 
Davis, Ralph Baltzer, June Williams, Jas 
Mims; L.B. Jones, Larson, J.C. Mullins, 
C. Taylor, Robert Stancill, Billy 
Henderson, and Fair Hays Jr. An 
unprovenienced collection from the 
Museum of the Mississippi Delta was 
transferred to MDAH in 2015. Lastly, 
there is also a collection from a surface 
survey conducted by the Mississippi 
Department of Transportation (MDOT) 
personnel in the 1970s or 1980s. This 
collection was transferred from MDOT 
to MDAH in 2025. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
three individuals have been identified 
from 22QU523 (Longstreet). The eight 
lots of associated funerary objects are 
one lot Native American ceramics, one 
lot lithics, one lot matrix, one lot clay, 
one lot faunal remains, one lot shell, 
one lot organic material, and one lot 
ochre. The site 22QU523 was excavated 
twice by MDAH as a survey in 1972 and 
a salvage excavation in 1975. Most of 
the human remains were excavated as 
part of these two excavations. Objects 
were also taken from this site by 
collectors R. Baltzer, Dr. Burnham and 
Robert Stancill at unknown dates. 
MDAH also has a surface collection 
conducted by University of Memphis in 
1972 that was donated to the C.H. Nash 
Museum at Chucalissa and transferred 
to MDAH in 2019 by way of the Desoto 
County Museum. 
In 2021, human remains and AFO 
from 22QU525 (Shady Grove) were 
listed in a Notice of Inventory 
Completion, published in the Federal 
Register on 1/22/2021 (FR 2021–01340). These human remains and associated 
funerary objects were repatriated to the 
Chickasaw Nation. The current notice 
includes additional human remains and 
associated funerary objects not included 
in the previous repatriations by the 
Mississippi Department of Archives and 
History. Human remains representing, at 
least, 16 individuals have been 
identified at 22QU525 (Shady Grove). 
The 11 lots of associated funerary 
objects are one lot Native American 
ceramics, one lot faunal remains, one lot 
lithics, one lot fine screen, one lot shell, 
one lot clay, one lot soil sample, one lot 
organic materials, one lot matrix, one lot 
ochre, and one lot ceramic effigy. Some 
of the objects came from a 1972 surface 
collection. In 1975, MDAH personnel 
excavated test pits and a burial on a 
level mound at 22QU525. The human 
remains from a bundle burial and 
associated funerary objects from this 
excavation were curated at MDAH. 
Between 2007 through 2010, the 
University of Southern Mississippi and 
MDAH personnel returned to 22QU525 
and performed a surface collection and 
excavation and located additional 
burials. The human remains from the 
burial and associated funerary objects 
from this excavation were curated at 
MDAH. A collection was donated by J. 
Buster at an unknown date with an 
unknown history. A surface collection 
by Memphis State University and from 
a private collector H. Osborn was 
transferred to the Desoto County 
Museum in 2013 and 2015 and then to 
MDAH in 2019. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual has been identified from 
22QU568 (Opossum Bend). The six lots 
of associated funerary objects are one lot 
shell, one lot faunal remains, one lot 
clay, one lot lithics, one lot ochre and 
one lot Native American ceramics. 
22QU568 consists of a surface 
collection. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
six individuals have been identified 
from 22QU569 (Drew Smith). The six 
lots of associated funerary objects are 
one lot Native American ceramics, one 
lot lithics, one lot faunal remains, one 
lot shell, one lot bead, and one lot clay. 
The majority of 22QU569 comes from a 
collection with an unknown history. 
Additional unprovenienced collections 
were donated to MDAH by two 
collectors Burt Jaeger in 2009 and Dr. 
Burnham. 
Through Tribal consultation, these 44 
individuals and 83 lots of associated 
funerary objects were identified as 
culturally affiliated with the Chickasaw 
Nation. To our knowledge, no 
potentially hazardous substances were 
used to treat any of the human remains 
or associated funerary objects. 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is clearly identified by the 
information available about the human 
remains and associated funerary objects 
described in this notice. 
Determinations 
The Mississippi Department of 
Archives and History has determined 
that: 
€The human remains described in this notice represent the physical

AGENCY: National Park Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), the 
University of Wisconsin Oshkosh 
(UWO) has completed an inventory of 
human remains and associated funerary 
objects and has determined that there is 
a cultural affiliation between the human 
remains and associated funerary objects 
and Indian Tribes or Native Hawaiian 
organizations in this notice. 
DATES: Repatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects 
in this notice may occur on or after 
January 16, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: Send written requests for repatriation of the human remains and 
associated funerary objects in this notice 
to Adrienne Frie, University of 
Wisconsin Oshkosh, 800 Algoma Blvd., 
Oshkosh, WI 54901, email friea@

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice is published as part of the 
National Park Service’s administrative 
responsibilities under NAGPRA. The 
determinations in this notice are the 
sole responsibility of UWO, and 
additional information on the 
determinations in this notice, including 
the results of consultation, can be found 
in its inventory or related records. The 
National Park Service is not responsible 
for the determinations in this notice. 
Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified. 
The individual was removed from a site 
listed as 47–WN–0086, Winnebago 
County, WI, which consists of a small 
cemetery associated with the Grignon 
trading post farmstead. The cemetery is 
known to contain the remains of 
Lieutenant Robert Grignon, his wife 
Mary, and her son. Robert Grignon was 
buried in this plot in 1861. Historical 
accounts also support that Robert 
Grignon shared this land with the 
Menominee so that they could rebury 
their dead from an endangered 
traditional cemetery. In 1936, Aurther 
Kannenberg, curator of the Oshkosh 
Public Museum, located the Grignon 
family plot and exhumed three burials 
identified as Robert Grignon, wife Mary, 
and Mary’s father. Many of the remains 
appear to have ended up in private 
collections. In 1993, Mary Schneider 
donated the collection of her late 
husband, Dr. Clarence James Schneider, 
to the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh 
(UWO). At UWO, a small box was found 
in his collection with the label, ‘‘From 
the Grave of Robert Grignon.’’ It is likely 
that Schneider was one of the 
individuals who stole remains from 
these burials. While it is not possible to 
confirm the specific identity of these 
remains, it is highly likely they 
belonged to someone in this small 
cemetery.The two associated funerary 
objects are one lot of coffin wood with 
nails and one lot of coffin nails. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
four individuals have been identified. 
The individuals were removed from the 
site of Gruwell (47–WN–0130), 
Winnebago County, WI in the summer 
of 1969. The landowner discovered 
Ancestral remains and gave them to the 
Winneconne Historical Society. The 
landowner notified James D. Volkman, 
an archaeologist associated with UWO, 
and in fall 1969 Volkman visited the site 
and recovered artifacts from the same 
location of the burials. A large portion 
of the artifacts found date to the Late 
Historic Period (post-1760 CE). In 1972, 
a field crew led by UWO Assistant 
Professor Alaric Faulkner also collected 
artifacts from the surface of the site. 
UWO was able to relocate the Ancestors 
removed from the Gruwell site at the 
Winneconne Historical Society and 
following Tribal guidance, transferred 
legal control of the remains to UWO in 
2025 to be repatriated with their 
associated funerary objects. Historical 
records indicate that in the later part of 
the 18th century into the early 19th 
century there was a Menominee village 
and cemetery on the shores of the Wolf 
River, where the modern village of 
Winneconne sits. Euroamerican 
settlement on the east shore of the river 
forced Menominee groups to the west 
shore. By 1850, the west shore consisted 
of a few Euroamerican houses and an 
‘‘Indian’’ cemetery, shortly before the 
village of Winneconne incorporated the 
west bank into the village boundaries. 
The 16 associated funerary objects are 
two lots of lithics; one lot of faunal 
bone; two lots of post contact pottery; 
one lot of bottle glass; one lot of iron 
nails and fastener; two lots of soil; one 
stone pipe; one Kaolin pipe; one lot of 
glass beads; one lot of bronze buttons; 
one bronze thimble; one lot of silver 
brooches; and one copper arm band. 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is clearly identified by the 
information available about the human 
remains and associated funerary objects 
described in this notice. 
Determinations 
UWO has determined that: 
€The human remains described in this notice represent the physical 
remains of five individuals of Native 
American ancestry. 
€The 18 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have 
been placed intentionally with or near 
individual human remains at the time of 
death or later as part of the death rite 
or ceremony. 
€There is a connection between the human remains and associated funerary 
objects described in this notice and the 
Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin. 
Requests for Repatriation 
Written requests for repatriation of the 
human remains and associated funerary 
objects in this notice must be sent to the 
authorized representative identified in 
this notice under 
ADDRESSES. Requests 
for repatriation may be submitted by:

Repatriation of the human remains 
and associated funerary objects 
described in this notice to a requestor 
may occur on or after January 16, 2026.

repatriation of the human remains and 
associated funerary objects are 
considered a single request and not 
competing requests. UWO is responsible 
for sending a copy of this notice to the

AGENCY: National Park Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), the Los 
Rios Community College District 
(LRCCD) intends to repatriate a certain 
cultural item that meets the definition of 
an unassociated funerary object and that 
has a cultural affiliation with the Indian 
Tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations 
in this notice. 
DATES: Repatriation of the cultural item in this notice may occur on or after 
January 16, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: Send additional, written requests for repatriation of the cultural 
items in this notice to Jamey Nye, Los 
Rios Community College District, 1919

responsibilities under NAGPRA. The 
determinations in this notice are the 
sole responsibility of LRCCD, and 
additional information on the 
determinations in this notice, including 
the results of consultation, can be found 
in the summary or related records. The 
National Park Service is not responsible 
for the determinations in this notice. 
Abstract of Information Available 
A total of one cultural item has been 
requested for repatriation. The one 
unassociated funerary object is a 
perforated dog tooth removed from 
Windmiller Mound (CA–SAC–107), 
Sacramento County, CA. The cultural 
item was likely removed during 
excavations at the site by William 
Purves, Jeremiah B. Lillard, and 
Sacramento Junior College in 1936. 
Between 1923 and 1940, Lillard was 
president of the Sacramento Junior 
College, now named Sacramento City 
College, which is one of four campuses 
in LRCCD. In April 2023, the item was 
located on the American River College 
campus, another campus within LRCCD. 
Determinations 
LRCCD has determined that: 
€The one unassociated funerary object described in this notice are 
reasonably believed to have been placed 
intentionally with or near human 
remains, and are connected, either at the 
time of death or later as part of the death 
rite or ceremony of a Native American 
culture according to the Native 
American traditional knowledge of a 
lineal descendant, Indian Tribe, or 
Native Hawaiian organization. The 
unassociated funerary objects have been 
identified by a preponderance of the 
evidence as related to human remains, 
specific individuals, or families, or 
removed from a specific burial site or 
burial area of an individual or 
individuals with cultural affiliation to 
an Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian 
organization. 
€There is a reasonable connection between the cultural item described in 
this notice and the Ione Band of Miwok 
Indians of California and the Wilton 
Rancheria, California. 
Requests for Repatriation 
Additional, written requests for 
repatriation of the cultural item in this 
notice must be sent to the authorized 
representative identified in this notice 
under 
ADDRESSES. Requests for 
repatriation may be submitted by any 
lineal descendant, Indian Tribe, or 
Native Hawaiian organization not 
identified in this notice who shows, by 
a preponderance of the evidence, that 
the requestor is a lineal descendant or 
a culturally affiliated Indian Tribe or 
Native Hawaiian organization. 
Repatriation of the cultural item in 
this notice to a requestor may occur on 
or after January 16, 2026. If competing 
requests for repatriation are received, 
LRCCD must determine the most 
appropriate requestor prior to 
repatriation. Requests for joint 
repatriation of the cultural item are 
considered a single request and not 
competing requests. LRCCD is 
responsible for sending a copy of this 
notice to the Indian Tribes and Native 
Hawaiian organizations identified in

Abstract of Information Available 
A total of four cultural items have 
been requested for repatriation. The four 
objects of cultural patrimony are one 
bow with three arrows made by Jack 
Suehead (Object Numbers 
1986.67.318.1–.4). The objects were 
acquired by the Placer County Museums 
Division by donation in 1986. 
Information about how the donor, 
Bernice Pate, acquired the objects is 
unknown. Pate’s husband, Waldo Pate, 
was a physician who treated local 
Indians. He often received baskets as 
payment for medical services and the 
couple continued collecting through 
purchases and gifts. In the 1960s, 
Bernice Pate served as the executive 
director of the California Indian 
Commission. The four objects of 
cultural patrimony are culturally 
affiliated with the Southern Maidu 
(Nisenan) and originated within their 
aboriginal territory in the vicinity of 
Placer County. The objects have not 
been exposed to any potentially 
hazardous substances while in the 
possession of the Placer County 
Museums Division. There is no visible 
evidence of prior treatment and no 
information indicating prior treatment. 
Determinations 
The Placer County Museums Division 
has determined that: 
€The four objects of cultural patrimony described in this notice have 
ongoing historical, traditional, or 
cultural importance central to the 
Native American group, including any 
constituent sub-group (such as a band, 
clan, lineage, ceremonial society, or 
other subdivision), according to the 
Native American traditional knowledge 
of an Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian 
organization. 
€There is a connection between the cultural items described in this notice 
and the United Auburn Indian 
Community of the Auburn Rancheria of 
California.

Abstract of Information Available 
A total of six cultural items have been 
requested for repatriation. The sacred 
objects are six baskets. The University is 
unaware of any specific treatment of the 
individual sacred objects with 
pesticides, preservatives, or other 
substances that represent a potential 
hazard to the objects or to persons 
handling the objects. However, records 
located in the Anthropology Museum 
indicate that approximately 
1
3of the 
Merriam collection had been treated 
with Berlou, a dry mothproofing 
substance used as an insecticide, in 
1964. It is unknown which baskets were 
treated. 
One of the sacred objects originates 
from Humboldt County—CHM–46 was 
purchased by Frank J. Hittell near 
Dyerville in August 1903 and is 
assumed to have been later gifted to or 
purchased by C. Hart Merriam. Two of 
the sacred objects originate from 
Mendocino County—CHM–97 and 
CHM–98 were purchased by C. Hart 
Merriam from Sally Bell at her home 
near Needle Rock Crossroads in August 
1923. Three sacred objects originate 
from Trinity County—CHM–47, CHM– 
48, and CHM–49 were purchased by C. 
Hart Merriam from ‘‘an old Indian 
Woman,’’ possibly Mrs. Lucy Young 
near Hettenshaw Valley in June 1922.

Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified. No 
associated funerary objects are present. 
In 1968, construction workers 
uncovered a burial site in Ganesha Park, 
Pomona, CA. The Los Angeles County 
coroner determined the remains to be 
Native American. Following this 
inadvertent discovery, two professors, 
Thomas Blackburn of Cal Poly Pomona 
and John S. Belmont of Pitzer College, 
Claremont, excavated the site. Later that 
year, Professor Belmont asked the 
coroner to release the remains to the 
Claremont Colleges Museum ‘‘in order 
that all material from this site be 
brought together in one institution for 
study.’’ The following year, Professor 
Belmont left Pitzer College, and the 
remains were lost until discovered in a 
hidden cabinet in the Professor’s former 
office in June of 2025. 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is reasonably identified by the

Abstract of Information Available 
A total of 30 cultural items in the 
Phoebe A Hearst Museum of 
Anthropology at the University of 
California, Berkeley have been 
requested for repatriation. 
In 1949, Albert Mohr via the 
University of California Archaeological 
Survey removed 15 lots of objects of 
cultural patrimony from the following 
sites in San Bernardino County, 
California: CA–SBR–74, CA–SBR–75, 
CA–SBR–77, CA–SBR–78, CA–SBR–79, 
and CA–SBR–80. The objects of cultural 
patrimony include ground stone and 
worked stone. 
A total of 14 objects of cultural 
patrimony were removed from the Troy 
Lake area, CA–SBR–146, and CA–SBR– 
317 in San Bernardino County, 
California in or around 1965 by Scott 
Ryerson. The objects of cultural 
patrimony include worked stone. 
Harry Godwin removed one object of 
cultural patrimony from the Sheep Hole 
Mountains in San Bernardino County, 
California in 1948. The object of cultural 
patrimony is a seed. 
Collections and collection spaces at 
the Phoebe A Hearst Museum of 
Anthropology were treated with 
substances for preservation and pest 
control, some potentially hazardous. No 
records have been found to date at the 
Museum to indicate whether or not 
chemicals or natural substances were 
used prior to 1960.

State University, Long Beach has 
completed an inventory of human 
remains and associated funerary objects 
and has determined that there is a 
cultural affiliation between the human 
remains and associated funerary objects 
and Indian Tribes or Native Hawaiian 
organizations in this notice. 
DATES: Repatriation of the human remains and associated funerary objects 
in this notice may occur on or after

determinations in this notice are the 
sole responsibility of California State 
University, Long Beach and additional 
information on the determinations in 
this notice, including the results of 
consultation, can be found in its 
inventory or related records. The 
National Park Service is not responsible 
for the determinations in this notice. 
Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing at least 
three individuals have been identified. 
The one associated funerary object is 
one bobcat skull. At an unknown date, 
the remains and associated funerary 
object were disinterred in Bakersfield, 
in Kern County, California by an 
individual who was ‘‘digging in the 
hills’’ and kept them in his possession. 
Upon his death, at an unknown date, his 
family recovered them and released 
them the Southern California Indian 
Center (SCIC). On October 29, 2019, 
SCIC transferred the possession of the 
remains to California State University, 
Long Beach (CSULB) for curation and 
assistance with the NAGPRA process. 
Since 2019, attempts to uncover more 
information had been unsuccessful due, 
in part to the closing of the SCIC. The 
ancestors were held at CSULB with a 
note: ‘‘Southern California Indian 
Center—now defunct.’’ In 2023 the 
remains were confirmed to be Native 
American. In June 2025, due to defunct 
status of the controlling organization, 
CSULB, with the support of the CSU 
Chancellor’s Office, made the decision 
to assume control of the remains in good 
faith to ensure repatriation of the 
ancestors. There is no record of the 
human remains or AFO being treated 
with potentially hazardous substances. 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is reasonably identified by the 
geographical location and acquisition 
history of the human remains and 
associated funerary objects described in 
this notice. 
Determinations 
California State University, Long 
Beach has determined that: 
€The human remains described in this notice represent the physical 
remains of three individuals of Native 
American ancestry. 
€The one object described in this notice are reasonably believed to have 
been placed intentionally with or near 
individual human remains at the time of 
death or later as part of the death rite 
or ceremony. 
€There is a connection between the human remains and associated funerary 
objects described in this notice and the 
Tejon Indian Tribe. 
Requests for Repatriation 
Written requests for repatriation of the 
human remains and associated funerary 
objects in this notice must be sent to the 
authorized representative identified in 
this notice under 
ADDRESSES. Requests 
for repatriation may be submitted by: 
1. Any one or more of the Indian 
Tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations

and associated funerary objects 
described in this notice to a requestor 
may occur on or after January 16, 2026.

Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing at least 
one individual have been identified on 
the campus of Western Kentucky 
University. No associated funerary 
objects are present. 
One Ancestor was identified in the 
summer of 2025 by a faculty member of 
the Department of Society, Culture, 
Crime, and Justice Studies, on the first 
floor of a building on campus. 
While sorting through a filing cabinet, 
one human skull was identified in the 
back of a filing cabinet, tucked behind 
a row of documents. These documents 
were various archaeological essays and 
reports. The remains are described as 
still having a layer of dirt covering the 
surface. 
There is no further provenience 
information for this individual, however 
due to the context information it is more 
than likely that the Ancestor is from the 
area. This is further supported by the 
fact that there was an active 
archaeologist who used to operate out of 
the building, and who excavated nearly 
exclusively within the state of 
Kentucky. 
There is no known exposure to 
hazardous substances.

Abstract of Information Available 
A total of 100 cultural items have 
been requested for repatriation. The 100 
objects of cultural patrimony are 47 
stone and mineral tools and fragments, 
20 bone and antler tools and fragments 
(including bone fishing implements), 16 
lots of animal remains including bones, 
five lots of stone net weights, four stone 
bowl fragments, three lots of vegetal 
remains, three baskets, one lot of bolas, 
and one steatite oil dish. These 
belongings have been identified as 
Wiyot in origin based on archaeological 
provenience or associated 
documentation. Most are from Tuluwat 
Island in Humboldt County, California. 
The Wiyot have lived on the island and 
lands surrounding Humboldt Bay since 
time immemorial. 
The Redding Museum League raised 
funds for the Redding Museum and Art 
Center (RMAC), now Turtle Bay 
Exploration Park, to purchase a steatite 
oil dish and six bolas from the Alice 
Dunaway collection through Fred 
Casebeer in 1971. Dunaway, a renowned 
basket collector from Happy Camp, CA, 
also collected other items, most of 
which reflect her Karuk heritage. These 
items, however, are documented in 
museum records as Wiyot. 
In 1972, the RMAC purchased a 
framed collection of bone fishing 
implements from Troy Crisp excavated 
from Gunther (now Tuluwat) Island in 
1962. Crisp, a Texas-born collector, 
lived briefly in Oregon and Northern 
California. He acquired a large 
collection of Native American and 
Indigenous Mexican Belongings over his 
lifetime through hobby field collecting 
and trading with other collectors. He 
primarily added to his collection 
through his business operating heavy 
equipment to clear brush land. Given 
that he did not move to California until 
1965, it is possible that the fishing 
implements were collected during a 
prior visit. 
In 1974, RMAC purchased a basalt 
maul attributed to the Wiyot from 
Geddes Harper of Eureka, CA. It was 
accessioned the same year. 
Under League President Mary Lou 
Lane, the Redding Museum League 
raised funds for the purchase of an open 
weave fish or sieve type basket of 
unpeeled willow and conifer root. It was 
accessioned in 1976. It is attributed to 
Wiyot, dated c.1930, and in excellent 
condition. 
In 1977, James ‘‘Jim’’ Dotta donated a 
sizable collection of archaeological 
materials to RMAC. In addition, a 
steatite bowl fragment was donated in 
1983 from his estate after his passing. 
Jim Dotta was a local instructor at 
Shasta Community College in Redding, 
CA, a professional archaeologist, and 
heavily involved in the Redding 
Museum and Art Center. He was also an 
avid collector of books, historical 
objects, artworks, and Indigenous 
Belongings. 
His 1977 donation accounts for 
eighty-six (86) of the items in this 
Notice. They include stone and mineral 
tools and fragments, like scrapers, 
projectile points, and net weights, as 
well as bone and antler tools and 
fragments such as awls, wedges, and 
fishing barbs. The animal remains 
include fish scales and bones, bird 
beaks and bones, animal teeth, horns, 
bones, and a baculum. Vegetal remains 
include corn cobs, rinds, and squash 
stems. There are also steatite and 
sandstone stone bowl fragments. 
According to museum records, these 
items were excavated by Dotta on 
Tuluwat Island. While they share a site 
number, there is no archaeological 
report on file at this museum. There is 
no indication these items are from a 
burial context. Mr. Dotta was generally 
careful in noting the presence or 
absence of burials in relation to artifacts. 
In 1982, RMAC purchased two Wiyot 
baskets from the Clarke Museum in 
Eureka, CA which deaccessioned a 
portion of its Native American basketry 
to other nonprofit institutions in 
accordance with its bylaws. These 
include a twined willow spoon basket 
(c.1880) and a twined flour tray (c.1900) 
made of bear grass, pine root, and hazel 
shoots. 
Turtle Bay Exploration Park does not 
treat Indigenous belongings with 
hazardous materials. However, the 
documentation does not reflect whether 
these items received treatment prior to 
the care of the Redding Museum and Art 
Center. 
Determinations 
Turtle Bay Exploration Park has 
determined that: 
€The 100 objects of cultural patrimony described in this notice have 
ongoing historical, traditional, or 
cultural importance central to the 
Native American group, including any 
constituent sub-group (such as a band, 
clan, lineage, ceremonial society, or 
other subdivision), according to the 
Native American traditional knowledge 
of an Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian 
organization. 
€There is a reasonable connection between the cultural items described in 
this notice and the Wiyot Tribe, 
California.

Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified. No 
associated funerary objects are present. 
The individual (MT12–209) may have 
been removed from the Glover Farm, 
also referred to as the Glover Site, in 
Christian County, Kentucky, by 
Raymond C. Vietzen (1907–1995), likely 
between approximately 1941 and the 
mid-1960s. While there is no record 
regarding potentially hazardous 
substances having been used to treat the 
human remains, an unidentified 
adhesive is present. It is unknown when 
the adhesive was applied. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified. No 
associated funerary objects are present. 
The individual (KY–CH–TIN–0004, V– 
MAN–0172) may have been removed 
from stone graves on the Glover Farm, 
also referred to as the Glover Site, in 
Christian County, Kentucky, by 
Raymond C. Vietzen (1907–1995), likely 
between approximately 1941 and the 
mid-1960s. While there is no record 
regarding potentially hazardous 
substances having been used to treat the 
human remains, an unidentified 
adhesive, and an unidentified plaster or 
similar type of substance are present. It 
is unknown when the adhesive and 
substance were applied. The human 
remains may have been treated with an 
unidentified preservative coating, 
consolidant, or sealant. It is unknown 
when this unidentified substance may 
have been applied. 
Vietzen, an avocational archaeologist, 
collector, and author, established the 
Indian Ridge Museum in Elyria, Ohio, 
and the Archaeological Society of Ohio 
(formerly the Ohio Indian Relic 
Collectors Society). The Indian Ridge 
Museum, founded in the 1930s, served 
as Vietzen’s laboratory and repository, 
and it remained in operation until the 
mid-1990s. After Vietzen’s death, the 
facility fell into disrepair, and most of 
the items he had acquired and housed 
at the museum were sold. In 1998, the 
Ohio Historical Society (presently the 
Ohio History Connection) removed 
ancestral human remains and some of 
the remaining items from the facility 
and temporarily housed them at the 
Ohio Historical Society. In October of 
2003, these remains were transferred 
from the Ohio Historical Society to 
Mercyhurst College (presently 
Mercyhurst University). 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is reasonably identified by the 
geographical location or acquisition 
history of the human remains described

Abstract of Information Available 
Based on the information available, 
human remains representing at least 
nine individuals have been reasonably 
identified. No associated funerary 
objects are present. These individuals 
were taken from what is now the Sioux 
City area by Terry Feret and his cousin 
(now deceased) in the 1970s. Feret took 
the human remains back to his 
residence in Fairplay, CO where they 
were stored at his residence and then 
transferred to History Colorado in 
Denver in 2020 when they were 
discovered by individuals cleaning out 
his barn. History Colorado arranged for 
the ancestors’ transfer back to Iowa via 
the UI OSA in January 2025. Based on 
information provided by the Park 
County Coroner and Feret, the original 
burial location was determined and 
designated 13WD261 in the Iowa Site 
File in July 2025. Two adult females, 
two adult males, one adult of unknown 
sex and four juveniles including a

excavated by University of Oregon 
archaeologists in 1960 at the site 
designated as YA–1 in Yamhill County, 
Oregon, approximately five miles 
southwest of the town of McMinnville. 
Additional human remains from the site 
were repatriated to the Confederated

present remains and belongings were 
discovered during a subsequent 
collections move by the Museum. The 
Yamhill County area is in the historic 
territory of Kalapuya peoples.

Abstract of Information Available 
A total of eight cultural items have 
been requested for repatriation. The 
eight objects of cultural patrimony are 
four petroglyphs and four pictographs. 
At an unknown time prior to 1891 Dr.

footprint from its original location in 
either Madison or St. Clair County, 
Illinois. He transferred it to the MHS in 
1891. 
In 1905 George Dickson of Alton 
Illinois removed four pictographs from 
their original location at Levis Bluff. He 
sold the pictographs to the MHS in 1921 
via a deal with Dr. Henry Milton 
Whelpley. 
At an unknown time, an unknown 
person or persons took one carved 
petroglyph of a footprint from an 
unknown site in Ste. Genevieve, Ste. 
Genvieve County, Missouri. This 
petroglyph was found and catalogued 
during a 1966 inventory of cultural 
heritage stewarded by the MHS 
performed by personnel at the 
University of Missouri, Columbia. 
At an unknown time prior to 1915 an 
unknown person or person took one 
carved petroglyph of a footprint from

Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing, at least, 
four individuals have been identified 
from the Calovich Mound site (14WY7) 
in Wyandotte County, KS (UBS 1991– 
72). The seven associated funerary 
objects include a bone bead, shell 
fragments, a rock, and animal bone. This 
Middle Ceramic village and burial site 
among the Missouri River bluffs was 
excavated in 1960 and then later 
assessed by KSHS in the 1970s. Human 
remains and funerary objects were 
removed from backdirt piles left by 
looter pits. Around this time, a nearby 
landowner removed teeth and a bone 
bead from the site and gave them to 
KSHS. To our knowledge, no hazardous 
substances were used to treat the human 
remains or associated funerary objects. 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is reasonably identified by the 
geographical location or acquisition 
history of the human remains and 
associated funerary objects described in 
this notice. 
Determinations 
The KSHS has determined that: 
€The human remains described in this notice represent the physical 
remains of four individuals of Native 
American ancestry. 
€The seven objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have 
been placed intentionally with or near 
individual human remains at the time of 
death or later as part of the death rite 
or ceremony. 
€There is a connection between the human remains and associated funerary 
objects described in this notice and the 
Kaw Nation, Oklahoma and the Pawnee 
Nation of Oklahoma.

Human remains representing at least 
24 individuals have been identified. The 
approximately 496 associated funerary 
objects include faunal bone, shell, 
charcoal, shell and bone mix, shell 
beads, ceramics. These ancestors and 
objects were recovered in excavations 
by Fred Cook in 1971 at 9BN7, Seven 
Mile Bend in Bryan County, Georgia. 
Cook likely brought the collection to the 
University of Georgia, Laboratory of 
Archaeology after the project but the 
date is not known. There is no record 
of any potentially hazardous substances. 
Human remains representing at least 
five individuals have been identified. 
The approximately 183 associated 
funerary objects include faunal bone, 
lithic, and ceramics. These ancestors 
and objects were excavated by Charles 
Pearson and Chester DePratter in 1973

funerary objects include ceramics, clay, 
nail, lithic, shell, faunal bone, and 
charcoal/burnt wood. The ancestor and 
objects were recovered in excavations 
from an unknown location in Chatham 
County, Georgia. Howard and 
DePratter’s names are written on other 
bags in this box (from other sites). So, 
it is probable that this unknown site was 
part of the NSF surface survey they were 
conducting in the 1970s. It is likely the 
collection was brought to the University 
of Georgia, Laboratory of Archaeology 
after the project but the date is not

Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing, at least, 
two individuals have been identified. 
The 172 associated funerary objects are 
potsherds, projectile points, stone tools, 
and blades. The remains of the first 
reasonably culturally identifiable 
individual were found in Milan 
Township, Allen County, Indiana, in 
1936 as part of county-wide 
archaeological survey. There are at 4 
mandible fragments, and other smaller 
fragments likely belong to the same 
mandible, and three human teeth are 
attributed to this one individual. Forty- 
four of the associated funerary objects 
are attributed to the same excavation 
site as the human remains. The remains 
of the second reasonably culturally 
identifiable individual were found in St. 
Joseph Township, Allen County, 
Indiana, in 1936 as part of the same 
county-wide archaeological survey. 
There is one grooved bone fragment that 
is believed to belong to one individual. 
There are 128 associated funerary 
objects that are attributed to the same 
excavation site as the human remains of 
the second individual. The human 
remains of these two individuals and 
the associated funerary objects arrived 
at the Allen County-Fort Wayne 
Historical Society in1972 and were 
originally part of the 1936 
Archaeological Survey of Allen County,

for the determinations in this notice. 
Abstract of Information Available 
A total of 753 cultural items have 
been requested for repatriation. All 753 
cultural items have been identified and 
requested as objects of cultural 
patrimony by the Tribe. 
A total of 371 items identified as 
objects of cultural patrimony by the 
Tribe includes groundstone tools, 
hammerstones, flaked stone tools, 
pottery fragments, fire affected rock 
fragment, unmodified faunal bone 
fragment, soil samples and lithic 
debitage. The items are associated with 
sites CA–LAN–166 and CA–LAN–518. 
The surface collection and test 
excavations that resulted in collection of 
these items occurred in the spring of 
1973 under the direction of Hal 
Eberhardt assisted by Warren Wasson. 
Eberhardt was a professor at Cal State 
LA and brought the collection to 
campus. Analysis was completed and an 
article describing the artifacts was 
published in 1978 in the Pacific Coast 
Archaeological Society Quarterly 
(Volume 14, Issue 2). No known 
hazardous substances were utilized to 
treat the items. 
A total of 37 items identified as 
objects of cultural patrimony by the 
Tribe includes groundstone tools, flaked 
stone tools and lithic debitage. The 
items are associated with site CA–LAN– 
173. These items appear to be from a 
surface collection conducted by Hal 
Eberhardt when he was faculty at Cal 
State LA in the early 1970s. No known 
hazardous substances were utilized to 
treat these items. 
A total of 10 items identified as 
objects of cultural patrimony by the 
Tribe includes groundstone tools, flaked 
stone tools and rock fragments. The 
items are associated with sites CA– 
LAN–75 and CA–LAN–338. It is unclear 
exactly how these items came to 
campus. 
Notsure.An archaeological site record was filled out by Hal 
Eberhardt in 1951 when he was faculty 
at Cal State LA, so it is assumed that 
Eberhardt brought these 10 items to Cal 
State LA sometime during the 1950s– 
1970s. No documentation has been 
found on how these items were 
collected. The small size and type of 
collection (10 items) suggest they were 
surface collected and not from 
excavations. No known hazardous 
substances were utilized to treat the 
items. 
A total of 335 items identified as 
objects of cultural patrimony by the 
Tribe includes groundstone tools, 
hammerstones, cores, flaked stone tools, 
unmodified faunal bone, wood (
14
C 
sample), and lithic debitage. The items 
are associated with site CA–LAN–399. 
Excavations were conducted by Hal 
Eberhardt between April 1966 and June 
1967 on the Glendora property of Mr. 
and Mrs. Sassone. A report for this 
excavation authored by Hal Eberhardt 
and Warren Wasson and titled The 
Sassone Site (Lan–339): A Milling Stone 
Horizon Station in the San Gabriel 
Valley, California Report indicates that 
that items were retained by the 
landowners with ‘‘a small type 
selection’’ being left with the 
Department of Anthropology, Cal State 
LA. This ‘‘type selection’’ are the items 
described here. No known hazardous 
substances were utilized to treat the 
items. 
Determinations 
California State University, Los 
Angeles has determined that: 
€The 753 items identified and characterized by the tribe as objects of 
cultural patrimony described in this 
notice have ongoing historical, 
traditional, or cultural importance 
central to the Native American group, 
including any constituent sub-group 
(such as a band, clan, lineage, 
ceremonial society, or other 
subdivision), according to the Native 
American traditional knowledge of an 
Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian 
organization. 
€There is a connection between the cultural items described in this notice 
and the Yuhaaviatam of San Manuel 
Nation (previously listed as San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, California). 
Requests for Repatriation 
Additional, written requests for 
repatriation of the cultural items in this 
notice must be sent to the authorized 
representative identified in this notice 
under

Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing, at least, 
100 individuals have been identified. 
The four lots of associated funerary 
objects are one lot of ceramic sherds, 
one lot of fauna and shell, one lot of 
lithics, and one lot of objects placed 
with or near human remains. These 
individuals and objects were recovered 
from the Carrigan or Gigen’s Cemetery 
site (40MT33) in Montgomery County, 
TN, by Paul Eden and H.C. ‘‘Buddy’’ 
Brehm with Southeastern Indian 
Antiquities Survey (SIAS) in September 
1974. This site dates to the 
Mississippian Period, 1000–1450 CE. 
These individuals and objects were 
transferred to UTK in 1975 for 
examination and retained. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual has been identified. The 
two lots of associated funerary objects 
are two lots of objects placed with or 
near human remains. This individual 
and objects were recovered from 
Coleman Cave (40MT16) in Montgomery 
County, TN. One individual and one lot 
of objects were discovered at UTK as 
part of the McIlhaney Collection in July 
2024. The circumstances of recovery 
and what brought this individual and 
objects to UTK are currently unknown. 
The second lot of objects were donated 
by an unknown caver to the Cave 
Archaeology Reasearch Team project 
directed by Jan Simek at UTK likely in 
the 1990s. This cave site dates from the 
Archaic to Mississippian periods. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual has been identified. No 
associated funerary objects are present. 
This individual was recovered by the 
Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office 
from an unknown location in 
Montgomery County and sent to the 
UTK Forensic Anthropology Center 
(FAC) in August of 1983 for 
examination. After FAC staff 
determined that the individual was 
Native American, and not of 
medicolegal concern, they were retained 
by the FAC as case 83–18. They 
remained at the FAC until they were 
recently transferred to the UTK Office of 
Repatriation. 
To our knowledge, no potentially 
hazardous substances have been used to 
treat any of the Ancestral remains or 
associated funerary objects. 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is clearly identified by the 
information available about the human 
remains and associated funerary objects 
described in this notice. 
Determinations 
UTK has determined that: 
€The human remains described in this notice represent the physical 
remains of 102 individuals of Native 
American ancestry. 
€The six lots of objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to 
have been placed intentionally with or 
near individual human remains at the 
time of death or later as part of the death 
rite or ceremony. 
€There is a connection between the human remains and associated funerary 
objects described in this notice and the 
Cherokee Nation; Eastern Band of 
Cherokee Indians; The Muscogee 
(Creek) Nation; Thlopthlocco Tribal 
Town; and the United Keetoowah Band 
of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma.

Repatriation of the human remains 
and associated funerary objects 
described in this notice to a requestor 
may occur on or after January 16, 2026.

Notice of Inventory Completion: 
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 
AGENCY: National Park Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and 
Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), the 
University of Michigan has completed 
an inventory of human remains 
(hereinafter referred to as ‘‘Ancestral 
remains’’ or ‘‘Ancestors’’) and has 
determined that there is a cultural 
affiliation between the Ancestral 
remains and Indian Tribes or Native 
Hawaiian organizations in this notice. 
DATES: Repatriation of the Ancestral remains in this notice may occur on or 
after January 16, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: Send written requests for repatriation of the Ancestral remains in 
this notice to Dr. Ben Secunda,

determinations in this notice are the 
sole responsibility of the University of 
Michigan, and additional information 
on the determinations in this notice, 
including the results of consultation, 
can be found in its inventory or related 
records. The National Park Service is 
not responsible for the determinations 
in this notice. 
Abstract of Information Available 
Ancestral remains representing, at 
least, two individuals have been 
identified. On an unknown date prior to 
1951, the Ancestors were removed from 
an unspecified location on the shore of 
Lake Champlain west of Orwell Village 
in Vermont. W.A. Dewey donated the 
Ancestral remains to the U–M Museum 
of Anthropological Archaeology 
(UMMAA). The year of acquisition is 
uncertain, but the sequence of 
UMMAA’s accession records may 
suggest the donation was made in the 
1920s. No time period has been 
determined for the burial. There are no 
associated funerary objects present. 
Although early records indicated the 
presence of animal bone fragments, no 
animal bone fragments have been 
located among the UMMAA’s holdings, 
and it is believed that this may have 
been a mis-notation of Ancestral 
remains. Consultation occurred with 
representatives of the Stockbridge 
Munsee Community, Wisconsin; as well 
as the W8banaki First Nation of Woˆlinak 
and Odanak, Canada. 
The University of Michigan has no 
record of, nor do its officials have any 
knowledge of, any treatment of the 
Ancestors with pesticides, 
preservatives, or other substances that 
represent a potential hazard to the 
collection(s) or to persons handling the 
collection(s). 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is reasonably identified by the 
geographical location or acquisition

Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified. No 
associated funerary objects are present. 
On April 16, 1961, the individual (VM– 
071) was removed from Adairville Cave 
located near the town of Adairville, 
Logan County, Kentucky. The 
individual was removed by Raymond C. 
Vietzen (1907–1995). While there is no 
record regarding potentially hazardous 
substances having been used to treat the 
human remains, an unidentified 
adhesive is present. It is unknown when 
the adhesive was applied. A residue, 
likely from tape, is also present. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified. No 
associated funerary objects are present. 
The individual (KY–LO–TIN–0001) was 
removed from a rockshelter at ‘‘Lost 
City’’ in Lewisburg, Logan County, 
Kentucky, by Raymond C. Vietzen 
(1907–1995). The individual was likely 
removed in the late 1930s or the 1940s. 
While there is no record regarding 
potentially hazardous substances having 
been used to treat the human remains, 
an unidentified adhesive is present. It is 
unknown when the adhesive was 
applied. 
Vietzen, an avocational archaeologist, 
collector, and author, established the 
Indian Ridge Museum in Elyria, Ohio, 
and the Archaeological Society of Ohio 
(formerly the Ohio Indian Relic 
Collectors Society). The Indian Ridge 
Museum, founded in the 1930s, served 
as Vietzen’s laboratory and repository, 
and it remained in operation until the 
mid-1990s. After Vietzen’s death, the 
facility fell into disrepair, and most of 
the items he had acquired and housed 
at the museum were sold. In 1998, the 
Ohio Historical Society (presently the 
Ohio History Connection) removed 
ancestral human remains and some of 
the remaining items from the facility 
and temporarily housed them at the 
Ohio Historical Society. In October of 
2003, these remains were transferred 
from the Ohio Historical Society to 
Mercyhurst College (presently 
Mercyhurst University). 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is reasonably identified by the 
geographical location or acquisition 
history of the human remains described 
in this notice. 
Determinations 
Mercyhurst University has 
determined that: 
€The human remains described in this notice represent the physical 
remains of two individuals of Native

object of cultural patrimony is a woven 
water basket made from willow, 
sapwood stem and inner bark 
(Accession 1965.49). The object was 
collected by F. May Young on an 
unknown date, and was later gifted to 
the University of California, Santa 
Barbara in 1965 by Mrs. Luella D. 
Saxby. The maker and precise source 
location are unknown; however, the 
basket is believed to originate from 
Nevada. It is unknown whether the 
object was treated with preservatives or 
other potentially hazardous substances.

not responsible for the determinations 
in this notice. 
Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified. No 
associated funerary objects are present. 
The individual was removed from 
Buzzard Cave likely located on the 
Glover Farm, also referred to as the 
Glover Site, in Christian County, 
Kentucky. The individual was removed 
by Raymond C. Vietzen (1907–1995), 
likely in 1962. While there is no record 
regarding potentially hazardous 
substances having been used to treat the 
human remains, tape and an 
unidentified adhesive are present. It is 
unknown when the tape and adhesive 
were applied. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
two individuals have been identified. 
The five associated funerary objects are 
modified faunal remains and 
unmodified faunal remains. The 
individuals and associated funerary 
objects were removed from Dry Cave 
located on the Glover Farm, also 
referred to as the Glover Site, in 
Christian County, Kentucky. The 
individuals and associated funerary 
objects were removed by Raymond C. 
Vietzen (1907–1995), likely in the 
1950s, probably 1953 and 1955. While 
there is no record regarding potentially 
hazardous substances having been used 
to treat the human remains and 
associated funerary objects, an 
unidentified adhesive is present. It is 
unknown when the adhesive was 
applied. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
14 individuals have been identified. The 
14 associated funerary objects are a 
lithic, modified faunal remains, possible 
shell, shell, and unmodified faunal 
remains. The individuals and associated 
funerary objects were removed from 
Glover’s Cave located on the Glover 
Farm, also referred to as the Glover Site, 
in Christian County, Kentucky, by 
Raymond C. Vietzen (1907–1995), likely 
between approximately 1941 and the 
mid-1960s. While there is no record 
regarding potentially hazardous 
substances having been used to treat the 
human remains, unidentified adhesives, 
an unidentified plaster or similar type of 
substance, and an unidentified 
preservative coating, consolidant, or 
sealant are present. An unidentified 
adhesive was used to attach a small 
piece of fabric to some of the human 
remains. It is unknown when these 
materials and substances were applied. 
A residue, likely from tape, is present 
on some of the human remains. An 
unidentified adhesive was applied to 
some of the associated funerary objects. 
It is unknown when the adhesive was 
applied. 
Vietzen, an avocational archaeologist, 
collector, and author, established the 
Indian Ridge Museum in Elyria, Ohio, 
and the Archaeological Society of Ohio 
(formerly the Ohio Indian Relic 
Collectors Society). The Indian Ridge 
Museum, founded in the 1930s, served 
as Vietzen’s laboratory and repository, 
and it remained in operation until the 
mid-1990s. After Vietzen’s death, the 
facility fell into disrepair, and most of 
the items he had acquired and housed 
at the museum were sold. In 1998, the 
Ohio Historical Society (presently the 
Ohio History Connection) removed 
ancestral human remains and some of 
the remaining items from the facility 
and temporarily housed them at the 
Ohio Historical Society. In October of 
2003, these remains were transferred 
from the Ohio Historical Society to 
Mercyhurst College (presently 
Mercyhurst University). 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is reasonably identified by the 
geographical location or acquisition 
history of the human remains and 
associated funerary objects described in 
this notice. 
Determinations

determined that: 
€The human remains described in this notice represent the physical 
remains of 17 individuals of Native 
American ancestry. 
€The 19 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have 
been placed intentionally with or near 
individual human remains at the time of 
death or later as part of the death rite 
or ceremony. 
€There is a connection between the human remains and associated funerary 
objects described in this notice and the 
Absentee-Shawnee Tribe of Indians of 
Oklahoma; Cherokee Nation; Eastern 
Band of Cherokee Indians; Eastern 
Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma; Shawnee 
Tribe; The Osage Nation; and the United 
Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in 
Oklahoma. 
Requests for Repatriation 
Written requests for repatriation of the 
human remains and associated funerary 
objects in this notice must be sent to the 
authorized representative identified in 
this notice under 
ADDRESSES. Requests

an Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian 
organization with cultural affiliation. 
Repatriation of the human remains 
and associated funerary objects 
described in this notice to a requestor 
may occur on or after January 16, 2026. 
If competing requests for repatriation 
are received, Mercyhurst University 
must determine the most appropriate 
requestor prior to repatriation. Requests 
for joint repatriation of the human 
remains and associated funerary objects 
are considered a single request and not 
competing requests. Mercyhurst 
University is responsible for sending a 
copy of this notice to the Indian Tribes 
and Native Hawaiian organizations 
identified in this notice and any other 
consulting parties.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 10, 2025, the Employment 
and Training Administration published 
a 60-day Federal Register notice at 90 
FR 43640 for the public to comment on 
proposed revisions to the ICR covered 
under H–2A Temporary Agricultural Labor Certification Program OMB 
Control Number 1205–0466 based on 
changes proposed through the notice of

Workers in Temporary Agricultural 
Employment in the United States.’’ The 
notice of proposed rulemaking proposed 
to rescind provisions of the H–2A final 
rule published by the Department on 
April 29, 2024. Due to the government 
shutdown, the public could not request 
copies of all associated forms and

documents during a significant portion 
of the 60-day comment period, which 
concluded on November 10, 2025. 
This notice ensures the public has the 
opportunity to request the supporting

are necessary to evaluate grants that 
have reached a period of performance 
end date. For additional substantive 
information about this ICR, see the 
related notice published in the Federal 
Register on May 13, 2025 (90 FR 20319). Comments are invited on: (1) whether 
the collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the Department,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
The Department of Labor, as part of 
the continuing effort to reduce 
paperwork and respondent (i.e., 
employer) burden, conducts a 
preclearance consultation program to 
provide the public with an opportunity 
to comment on proposed and 
continuing information collection 
requirements in accordance with the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) 
(44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)). This program 
ensures that information is in the 
desired format, reporting burden (time 
and costs) is minimal, the collection 
instruments are clearly understood, and 
OSHA’s estimate of the information 
collection burden is accurate. The 
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 
1970 (OSH Act) (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) 
authorizes information collection by 
employers as necessary or appropriate 
for enforcement of the OSH Act or for 
developing information regarding the 
causes and prevention of occupational 
injuries, illnesses, and accidents (29 
U.S.C. 657). The OSH Act also requires 
that OSHA obtain such information 
with minimum burden upon employers, 
especially those operating small 
businesses, and to reduce to the 
maximum extent feasible unnecessary 
duplication of effort in obtaining 
information (29 U.S.C. 657). 
The following sections describe who 
uses the information collected under 
each requirement, as well as how they 
use it. The Construction Fall Protection 
Systems Criteria, Practices, and Training 
Requirements Standard requires 
employers to certify safety nets and 
develop fall protection plans, 
respectively, and prepare worker 
training certification records. These 
standards ensure that employers 
provide the required fall protection for 
their workers and provide the required 
training. 
II. Special Issues for Comment 
OSHA has a particular interest in 
comments on the following issues: 
€Whether the proposed information collection requirements are necessary 
for the proper performance of the 
agency’s functions to protect workers, 
including whether the information is 
useful; 
€The accuracy of OSHA’s estimate of the burden (time and costs) of the 
information collection requirements, 
including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used; 
€The quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; and 
€Ways to minimize the burden on employers who must comply; for 
example, by using automated or other 
technological information, and 
transmission techniques. 
III. Proposed Actions 
OSHA is requesting that OMB extend 
the approval of the information 
collection requirements contained in the 
Construction Fall Protection Systems 
Criteria, Practices, and Training 
Requirements Standard. The agency is 
requesting an adjustment increase in 
burden going from 506,903 to 560,607 
hours, a total increase of 53,704 hours. 
The adjustment increase is primarily the 
result of an increase in the number of 
affected establishments going from 
406,714 to 449,782 establishments. 
Also, the total number of responses 
increased going from 6,072,808 to 
6,715,846. 
OSHA will summarize the comments 
submitted in response to this notice and 
will include this summary in the 
request to OMB to extend the approval 
of the information collection 
requirements. 
Type of Review: Extension of a 
currently approved collection.

1926.502), and Training Requirements

Butadiene are above the standard’s 
permissible exposure limits or action 
level, label respirator filter elements to 
indicate the date and time it is first

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
The Department of Labor, as part of a 
continuing effort to reduce paperwork 
and respondent (i.e., employer) burden, conducts a preclearance process to 
provide the public with an opportunity 
to comment on proposed and 
continuing information collection 
requirements in accordance with the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) 
(44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)). This program 
ensures that information is in the 
desired format, the reporting burden 
(time and costs) is minimal, the 
collection instruments are clearly 
understood, and OSHA’s estimate of the 
information collection burden is 
accurate. The Occupational Safety and 
Health Act of 1970 (the OSH Act) (29 
U.S.C. 651 et seq.) authorizes 
information collection by employers as 
necessary or appropriate for 
enforcement of the OSH Act or for 
developing information regarding the 
causes and prevention of occupational 
injuries, illnesses, and accidents (see 29 
U.S.C. 657). The OSH Act also requires 
that OSHA obtain such information 
with a minimum burden upon 
employers, especially those operating 
small businesses, and to reduce to the 
maximum extent feasible unnecessary 
duplication of effort in obtaining 
information (see 29 U.S.C. 657). 
The Respirable Crystalline Silica 
Standards for general industry (29 CFR 
1910.1053), shipyards (29 CFR 
1915.1053) and construction (29 CFR 
1926.1153) contain the following 
information collection requirements: 
conducting worker exposure 
assessments and notifying workers of 
the assessment results and any 
corrective actions being taken; 
establishing, implementing, reviewing, 
evaluating, and updating a written 
exposure control plan and making the 
plan available to workers and 
designated representatives; creating and 
submitting air quality permit 
notifications; establishing a respiratory

records; and providing workers and 
designated representatives with access 
to these records. The records are used 
by workers, employers, and OSHA to 
determine the effectiveness of the 
employer’s compliance efforts. 
II. Special Issues for Comment 
OSHA has a particular interest in 
comments on the following issues: 
€Whether the proposed information collection requirements are necessary 
for the proper performance of the 
agency’s functions, including whether 
the information is useful; 
€The accuracy of OSHA’s estimate of the burden (time and costs) of the 
information collection requirements, 
including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used; 
€The quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; and 
€Ways to minimize the burden on employers who must comply; for 
example, by using automated or other 
technological information collection 
and transmission techniques. 
III. Proposed Actions 
OSHA is requesting that OMB extend 
its approval of the information 
collection requirements contained in the 
Respirable Crystalline Silica Standards 
for General Industry, Shipyards and 
Construction. The agency is requesting 
an adjustment increase of 390,697 in 
burden going from 7,796,128 to 
8,186,825 hours. The increase is largely 
due to an increase in the estimated 
number of construction establishments 
due to an increased business formation 
rate, resulting in increased burden hours 
requirements to develop and implement 
the written access control plan and a 
change to the estimation method for 
determining the number of employees 
undergoing periodic medical 
examinations. Also, the agency is 
requesting an adjustment decrease of 
$40,884,305 for operation and 
maintenance costs going from 
$261,709,625 to $220,825,320. This 
reduction is mainly due to updated unit 
cost estimates for direct medical costs 
(using the 2025 CMS Physician Fee 
schedule) for the medical examinations 
given to employees under the medical 
surveillance provisions. 
OSHA will summarize the comments 
submitted in response to this notice and 
will include this summary in the 
request to OMB to extend the approval 
of the information collection 
requirements.

currently approved collection.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
The Department of Labor, as part of 
the continuing effort to reduce 
paperwork and respondent (i.e., 
employer) burden, conducts a 
preclearance consultation program to 
provide the public with an opportunity 
to comment on proposed and 
continuing information collection 
requirements in accordance with the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) 
(44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)). This program 
ensures that information is in the 
desired format, reporting burden (time 
and costs) is minimal, the collection 
instruments are clearly understood, and 
OSHA’s estimate of the information 
collection burden is accurate. The 
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 
1970 (OSH Act) (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) 
authorizes information collection by 
employers as necessary or appropriate 
for enforcement of the OSH Act or for 
developing information regarding the 
causes and prevention of occupational 
injuries, illnesses, and accidents (29 
U.S.C. 657). The OSH Act also requires 
that OSHA obtain such information 
with minimum burden upon employers, 
especially those operating small 
businesses, and to reduce to the 
maximum extent feasible unnecessary 
duplication of effort in obtaining 
information (29 U.S.C. 657). 
The Standard specifies several 
paperwork requirements. The following 
sections describe who uses the 
information collected under each 
requirement, as well as how they use it. 
The purpose of each of these 
requirements is to prevent workers from 
using unsafe cranes and ropes, thereby 
reducing their risk of death or serious 
injury caused by a crane or rope failure 
during material handling. 
(A) Inspection of and Certification 
Records for Cranes (§ 1910.180(d)(4),(6)) 
Paragraph 1910.180(d) specifies that 
employers must prepare a written 
record to certify that the monthly 
inspection of critical items in use on 
cranes (such as brakes, crane hooks, and 
ropes) has been performed. The 
certification record must include the 
inspection date, the signature of the 
person who conducted the inspection, 
and the serial number (or other 
identifier) of the inspected crane. 
Employers must keep the certificate 
readily available. The certification 
record provides employers, workers, 
and OSHA compliance officers with 
assurance that critical items on cranes 
have been inspected, and that the 
equipment is in good operating 
condition so that the crane and rope 
will not fail during material handling. 
These records also enable OSHA to 
determine that an employer is 
complying with the Standard. 
(B) Rated Load Tests (§ 1910.180(e)(2)) 
This provision requires employers to 
make available written reports of load- 
rating tests showing test procedures and 
confirming the adequacy of repairs or 
alterations, and to make readily 
available any rerating test reports. These 
reports inform the employer, workers, 
and OSHA compliance officers of a 
crane’s lifting limitations, and provide 
information to crane operators to 
prevent them from exceeding these 
limits and thereby causing crane failure. 
(C) Inspection and Certification Records 
for Ropes (§ 1910.180(g)(1), (g)(2)(ii)) 
Paragraph (g)(1) requires employers to 
thoroughly inspect any rope in use at 
least once a month. The authorized 
person conducting the inspection must 
observe any deterioration resulting in 
appreciable loss of original strength and 
determine whether or not the condition 
is hazardous. Before reusing a rope that 
has not been used for at least a month 
because the crane housing the rope is 
shut down or in storage, paragraph 
(g)(2)(ii) specifies that employers must 
have an appointed or authorized person 
inspect the rope for all types of 
deterioration. Employers must prepare a 
certification record for the inspections 
required by paragraphs (g)(1) and 
(g)(2)(ii). These certification records 
must include the inspection date, the 
signature of the person conducting the 
inspection, and the identifier for the 
inspected rope; paragraph (g)(1) states 
that employers must keep the 
certificates ‘‘on file where readily 
available,’’ while paragraph (g)(2)(ii) 
requires that certificates ‘‘be . . . kept 
readily available.’’ The certification 
records assure employers, workers, and 
OSHA that the inspected ropes are in 
good condition. 
II. Special Issues for Comment 
OSHA has a particular interest in 
comments on the following issues: 
€Whether the proposed information collection requirements are necessary 
for the proper performance of the 
agency’s functions to protect workers, 
including whether the information is 
useful; 
€The accuracy of OSHA’s estimate of the burden (time and costs) of the 
information collection requirements, 
including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used; 
€The quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; and 
€Ways to minimize the burden on employers who must comply; for 
example, by using automated or other 
technological information, and 
transmission techniques. 
III. Proposed Actions 
OSHA is requesting that OMB extend 
its approval of the information 
collection requirements contained in the 
Crawler, Locomotive, and Truck Cranes 
Standard. The agency is seeking an 
adjustment decrease in its current 
burden of 2,048 hours, going from 
29,639 to 27,591 hours. This decrease in 
burden is due to the decrease of 
operational cranes used in general 
industry by 2,343, going from 33,986 to 
31,643 cranes. 
OSHA will summarize the comments 
submitted in response to this notice and 
will include this summary in the 
request to OMB to extend the approval 
of the information collection 
requirements.

Occupational Safety and Health Act of 
1970 (OSH Act) (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) 
authorizes information collection by 
employers as necessary or appropriate 
for enforcement of the OSH Act or for 
developing information regarding the 
causes and prevention of occupational 
injuries, illnesses, and accidents (29 
U.S.C. 657). The OSH Act also requires 
that OSHA obtain such information 
with minimum burden upon employers, 
especially those operating small 
businesses, and to reduce to the 
maximum extent feasible unnecessary 
duplication of effort in obtaining 
information (29 U.S.C. 657). 
The Manlifts Standard (29 CFR 
1910.68(e)) specifies two paperwork 
requirements. The following sections 
describe who uses the information 
collected under each requirement, as 
well as how they use it. The purpose of 
these requirements is to reduce workers’ 
risk of death or serious injury by 
ensuring that manlifts are in safe 
operating condition. 
Periodic Inspection and Records 
(Paragraph (e)) 
This provision requires that each 
manlift be inspected at least once every 
30 days and it also requires that limit 
switches shall be checked weekly. The 
manlift inspection is to cover at least the 
following items: steps; step fastenings; 
rails; rail supports and fastenings; 
rollers and slides; belt and belt tension; 
handholds and fastenings; floor 
landings; guardrails; lubrication; limit 
switches; warning signs and lights; 
illumination; drive pulley; bottom (boot) 
pulley and clearance; pulley supports; 
motor; driving mechanism; brake; 
electrical switches; vibration and 
misalignment; and any ‘‘skip’’ on the up 
or down run when mounting a step 
(indicating worn gears). A certification

date of inspection, the signature of the 
person who performed the inspection, 
and the serial number or other identifier 
of the inspected manlift. 
Disclosure of Inspection Certification 
Records 
Employers are to maintain the 
certification record and make it 
available to OSHA compliance officers. 
This record provides assurance to 
employers, workers, and compliance 
officers that manlifts were inspected as 
required by the Standard. The 
inspections are made to keep equipment 
in safe operating condition thereby 
preventing manlift failure while 
carrying workers to elevated worksites. 
These records also provide the most 
efficient means for the compliance 
officers to determine that an employer is 
complying with the Standard.

OSHA has a particular interest in 
comments on the following issues: 
€Whether the proposed information collection requirements are necessary

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
The War Hazards Compensation Act 
(WHCA), 42 U.S.C. 1701 et seq., provides reimbursement to insurance 
carriers and self-insured employers for 
workers’ compensation benefits paid 
under the Defense Base Act (DBA) (an 
extension of the Longshore and Harbor 
Workers’ Compensation Act (LHWCA)) 
due to injuries or death resulting from 
a war risk hazard. 
Currently, OWCP utilizes the CA–278 
form for insurance carriers and self- 
insured employers to request 
reimbursement. The form is used for 
submission of reimbursement requests. 
There is currently no adequate form for 
an Actuarial Attestation under the 
WHCA. The insurance carriers and self- 
insured are required to verify that no 
additional premium was charged for 
war-risk hazard claims. 
Under Section 104 of the WHCA, 
private insurance carriers or self-insured 
employers may seek reimbursement for 
payments made in conjunctions with a 
WHCA-covered injury. 20 CFR 61.100 
states: 
Under 20 CFR 61.100: (a) The Office 
shall reimburse any carrier that pays 
benefits under the Defense Base Act or 
other applicable workers’ compensation 
law due to the injury, disability or death 
of any person specified in Sec. 61.1(a), 
if the injury or death for which the 
benefits are paid arose from a war-risk 
hazard. The amount to be reimbursed 
includes disability and death payments, 
funeral and burial expenses, medical 
expenses, and the reasonable and 
necessary claims expense incurred in 
processing the request.’’ (b) The Office 
shall not provide reimbursement in any 
case in which an additional premium 
for war-risk hazard was charged, or in 
which the carrier has been reimbursed, 
paid, or compensated for the loss for 
which reimbursement is requested.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES58632 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Notices Arenas, Chile). OSEI will be the 
operator of record and will oversee all 
activities undertaken by DAP 
Helico´pteros as part of M/V Ortelius’ 
activities in Antarctica. 
Helicopters will be used for aerial 
sightseeing and landings away from the 
ship. Helicopter landings are planned 
on both land and sea ice. Local 
conditions will in part determine the 
final itinerary. Helicopter activities will 
take place in a way that does not disturb 
wildlife and will not result in harmful 
interference with native animals and 
plants. Trips will be of short duration 
and will be conducted in good to 
acceptable weather conditions and will 
not enter any Antarctic Special 
Protected Areas. 
Location: Antarctic Peninsula region and the Weddell Sea. 
Dates of Permitted Activities: 
December 2025–February 2027. 
Permit Application: 2026–013 
3. Applicant: Zhongwen Zhan, California Institute of Technology, 
1200 East California Blvd., 
Pasadena, CA 91125 
Activity for Which Permit Is 
Requested: Waste Management (45 CFR 671). The applicant seeks an Antarctic 
Conservation Act permit for waste 
management activities associated with 
research on critical processes that 
control glacier dynamics at Union 
Glacier in the vicinity of Constellation 
Inlet. To accomplish the research, the 
project will deploy a number of 
different instruments over the course of 
the permit period. The applicants will 
contract with Antarctic Logistics & 
Expeditions LLC (ALE) for services 
including communications and medical 
evacuation support, flight provisioning, 
field support such as snowmobiles, 
accommodations, guides, fuel and 
equipment. All participants in the 
project will receive environmental and 
safety training prior to deployment as 
well as on-site training at Union Glacier 
Base camp before relocating to the 
Constellation Inlet field camp with a 
total anticipated time in the field of 20 
days. Glacial dynamics will be 
measured in the vicinity of the 
Constellation Inlet. This work requires 
the installation of up to 20 km of thin 
single strand fiberoptic cables weighing 
a total of less than 10 kg to provide a 
backbone for a Distributed Acoustic 
Sensor (DAS) to detect seismic stress. 
The cables will be placed in narrow ice 
trenches, and the trenches will then be 
backfilled and compressed. The 
subsequent sintering will prevent 
removal of the cables at the conclusion 
of the study but also protects them from 
redistribution in the environment. In 
addition, up to 500 accelerometers and 
20 Geophones will be deployed along 
the DAS array and will be removed at 
project completion by ALE employees. 
Stationary and towed ground 
penetrating radar systems will also be 
employed along with a 10 antenna 
Global Navigation Satellite System array 
and removed after use. 
Location: Union Glacier. Dates of Permitted Activities: 5 
January 2025–28 February 2027. 
Permit Application: 2026–015 
4. Applicant: Benjamin Couturier, P.O. Box 2174, Seward, AK 99664 USA 
Activity for Which Permit Is 
Requested: Waste Management (45 CFR 671). The applicant seeks an Antarctic 
Conservation Act permit for waste 
management activities associated with 
operating the motor yacht Kalista and 
using Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems 
(RPAS) in Antarctic waters. Operations 
would include shore excursions by 
dinghy. The yacht would carry up to 
4,226 gallons of diesel fuel in internal 
tanks. In addition, up to 165 gallons of 
gasoline will be stored in external 
storage tanks for use in dinghy 
operation. Transfer of fuel from external 
tanks would be conducted in a 
contained and controlled environment. 
A spill kit and absorbent pads would be 
available during all fueling and fuel 
transfers. Solid waste will be contained 
and stored on the vessel and disposed 
of outside of the Antarctic Treaty area. 
The applicant would operate small, 
battery-operated RPAS consisting, in 
part, of a quadcopter equipped with 
cameras to aid in navigation and to 
collect footage of the Antarctic. The 
RPAS would not be flown over wildlife, 
or over Antarctic Specially Protected 
Areas or Historic Sites and Monuments. 
Several measures would be taken to 
prevent against loss of the RPAS 
including terminating flights with at 
least 40% battery life remaining; having 
an observer on the lookout for wildlife, 
people, and other hazards; maintaining 
flights below 400 ft above ground level 
and ensuring that the separation 
between the operator and quadcopter 
does not exceed visual line of sight. The 
applicant is seeking a Waste Permit to 
cover any accidental releases that may 
result from operating the vessel, 
conducting shore excursions, or 
operating the RPAS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Title of Collection: Program 
Monitoring Data Collections for the 
National Science Foundation (NSF) 
Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Program. 
OMB Number: 3145–0267. 
Type of Request: Intent to renew an 
information collection for post-award 
output and outcome monitoring system. 
Abstract: The National Science Foundation (NSF) Innovation Corps (I- 
Corps) Program was started in 2011 to 
develop and nurture a national 
innovation ecosystem built upon 
fundamental research that guides the 
output of scientific and engineering 
discoveries closer to the development of 
technologies, products, and services that 
benefit society. 
The goal of the I-Corps Program is to 
use experiential education to help 
entrepreneurial researchers reduce the 
time necessary to translate promising 
ideas from the laboratory bench to 
widespread implementation. In addition 
to accelerating technology translation, 
the NSF I-Corps program also seeks to 
reduce the risk associated with 
technology development conducted 
without insight into industry 
requirements and challenges. 
The NSF I-Corps Program is designed 
to support the commercialization of 
‘‘deep technologies,’’ those revolving 
around fundamental discoveries in 
science and engineering. The program 
addresses the skill and knowledge gaps 
associated with the transformation of 
basic research into deep technology 
ventures. The program enables 
entrepreneurial researchers in deep 
technologies to receive support in the 
form of entrepreneurial education, 
industry mentoring, and funding to 
accelerate the translation of knowledge 
derived from fundamental research into 
emerging products and services that 
may attract subsequent third-party 
funding. I-Corps training and 
infrastructure together represent an 
important investment for NSF and the 
Nation, as directed by the American 
Innovation and Competitiveness Act 
(AICA), Public Law 114–329, Section 
601. 
These selected researchers form teams 
and participate in the I-Corps Teams 
Program Curriculum. An I-Corps team 
includes the Entrepreneurial Lead (EL), 
Technical Lead (TL) or the Principal 
Investigator (PI), and the Industrial 
Mentor (IM). During the training 
program, the team is expected to spend 
significant time conducting active 
customer discovery, including 
interviewing potential customers and 
potential partners. The outcomes of I- 
Corps Teams projects will be threefold: 
(1) a decision on a clear path forward 
based on an assessment of the business 
model, (2) substantial first-hand 
evidence for or against product-market 
fit, with the identification of customer 
segments and corresponding value 
propositions, and (3) a narrative of a 
compelling technology demonstration 
for potential partners. 
The NSF I-Corps program requests the 
Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) approval of this clearance that 
will allow the programs to improve the 
rigor of our surveys for evaluations and 
program monitoring, as well as to 
initiate new data collections to monitor 
the immediate, intermediate, and long- 
term outcomes of our investments by 
periodically surveying the I-Corps teams 
and their members. The clearance will 
allow the program to rigorously 
develop, test, and implement survey 
instruments and methodologies. 
The primary objective of this 
clearance is to allow the NSF I-Corps 
program to collect characteristics, 
inputs, outputs, and outcomes 
information from the I-Corps teams 
funded by the program. This collection 
will enable the evaluation of the 
impacts on the four themes as outlined 
in the FY 2021 Biennial Report to 
Congress (https://www.nsf.gov/news/ 
special_reports/i-corps/pdf/NSFI- Corps2021BiennialReport.pdf): 1. Training an Entrepreneurial 
Workforce 
2. Translating Technologies 
3. Nurturing an Innovation Ecosystem 
4. Enabling Economic Impact 
The second, related objective is to 
improve our questionnaires and/or data 
collection procedures through pilot tests 
and other survey methods used in these 
activities. Under this clearance a variety 
of surveys could be pre-tested, 
modified, and used. 
Following standard OMB 
requirements, NSF will submit to OMB 
an individual request for each survey 
project we undertake under this 
clearance. NSF will request OMB 
approval in advance and provide OMB 
with a copy of the questionnaire and 
materials describing the project. 
Data collected will be used for 
planning, management, evaluation, and 
audit purposes. Summaries of output 
and outcome monitoring data are used 
to respond to queries from Congress, the 
public, NSF’s external merit reviewers 
who serve as advisors, including 
Committees of Visitors (COVs), NSF’s 
Office of the Inspector General, and 
other pertinent stakeholders. These data 
are needed for effective administration, 
program monitoring, evaluation, 
outreach/marketing roadmaps, and for 
strategic reviews and measuring 
attainment of NSF’s program and 
strategic goals, as identified by the 
President’s Accountable Government 
Initiative, the Government Performance 
and Results Act Modernization Act of 
2010, Evidence-Based Policymaking Act 
of 2018, and NSF’s Strategic Plan. 
All questions asked in the data 
collection are questions that are NOT 
included in the annual, final or 
outcomes reports, and the intention is to 
ask the grantees even beyond the period 
of performance on voluntary basis in 
order to capture impacts of the research 
that occur during and beyond the life of 
the award. 
Grantees will be invited to submit 
information on a periodic basis to 
support the management of the NSF I- 
Corps investment portfolio. Once the 
survey tool is tested, grantees will be 
invited to submit these indicators to 
NSF via data collection methods that 
include, but are not limited to, online 
surveys, interviews, focus groups, 
phone interviews, etc. These indicators 
are both quantitative and descriptive 
and may include, for example, the 
characteristics of project personnel, 
sources of funding and support, 
knowledge transfer and technology 
translation activities, patents, licenses, 
publications, descriptions of significant 
advances, and other outcomes of the 
funded efforts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Introduction 
The NRC is considering the approval 
of the initial and updated DFPs 
submitted by the STP 1 and 2 ISFSI 
licensee, and the NRC staff has prepared 
a final EA and FONSI determination for 
the initial and updated STP 1 and 2 
ISFSI DFPs in accordance with the NRC 
regulations in part 51 of title 10 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), 
‘‘Environmental Protection Regulations 
for Domestic Licensing and Related 
Regulatory Functions,’’ which 
implement the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 
U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). 
The NRC requires its licensees to plan 
for the eventual decommissioning of 
their licensed facilities prior to license 
termination. On June 17, 2011, the NRC 
published a final rule in the Federal 
Register amending its decommissioning planning regulations (76 FR 35512). The 
final rule amended the NRC regulation, 
10 CFR 72.30, ‘‘Financial assurance and 
recordkeeping for decommissioning,’’ 
which concerns financial assurance and 
decommissioning for ISFSIs. This 
regulation requires each holder of, or 
applicant for, a license under 10 CFR 
part 72 to submit a DFP for the NRC’s 
review and approval. The purpose of the 
DFP is to demonstrate the licensee’s 
financial assurance, i.e., that funds will be available to decommission the ISFSI. 
The NRC staff will later publish its 
financial analyses of the DFP submittals 
which will be available for public 
inspection in ADAMS. 
II. Discussion 
The table in this notice includes the 
plant name, docket number, licensee, 
and ADAMS accession number for the 
final EA and FONSI determination for 
the STP 1 and 2 ISFSI. The table also 
includes the ADAMS accession 
numbers for other relevant documents, 
including the initial and updated DFP 
submittals. For further details with 
respect to these actions, see the NRC 
staff’s final EA and FONSI 
determinations which are available for 
public inspection in ADAMS and at

Action.
The NRC staff has determined that the proposed action, the review and approval of STPNOC’s initial and 
updated DFPs, submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 72.30(b) and (c), will not authorize changes to li-
censed operations or maintenance activities, or result in changes in the types, characteristics, or quan-
tities of radiological or non-radiological effluents released into the environment from the independent 
spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI), or result in the creation of solid waste. Moreover, the approval of 
the initial and updated DFPs will not authorize any construction activity, facility modification, or other 
land-disturbing activity. The NRC staff has concluded that the proposed action is a procedural and ad-
ministrative action that will not have a significant impact on the environment. 
Finding of No Significant Impact ..... The proposed action does not require changes to the ISFSI’s licensed routine operations, maintenance ac-
tivities, or monitoring programs, nor does it require new construction or land-disturbing activities. The 
scope of the proposed action concerns only the NRC’s review and approval of STPNOC’s initial and up-
dated DFPs. The scope of the proposed action does not include, and will not result in, the review and 
approval of decontamination or decommissioning activities or license termination for the ISFSI or for 
other parts of STP 1 and 2. Therefore, the NRC staff determined that approval of the initial and updated 
DFPs for the STP 1 and 2 ISFSI will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment, and 
accordingly, the staff has concluded that a FONSI is appropriate. The NRC staff further finds that prepa-
ration of an environmental impact statement is not required.

RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD 
Proposed Collection; Comment 
Request 
Summary: In accordance with the requirement of Section 3506 (c)(2)(A) of 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
which provides opportunity for public 
comment on new or revised data 
collections, the Railroad Retirement 
Board (RRB) will publish periodic 
summaries of proposed data collections. 
Comments are invited on: (a) Whether 
the proposed information collection is 
necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of the agency, including 
whether the information has practical 
utility; (b) the accuracy of the RRB’s 
estimate of the burden of the collection 
of the information; (c) ways to enhance 
the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected; and (d) 
ways to minimize the burden related to 
the collection of information on 
respondents, including the use of 
automated collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology. 
1. Title and purpose of information 
collection: Evidence of Marital Relationship—Living with 
Requirements; OMB 3220–0021. 
To support an application for a 
spouse or widow(er)’s annuity under 
Sections 2(c) or 2(d) (45 U.S.C. 231a) of 
the Railroad Retirement Act, an 
applicant must submit proof of a valid 
marriage to a railroad employee. In 
some cases, the existence of a marital 
relationship is not formalized by a civil 
or religious ceremony. In other cases, 
questions may arise about the legal 
termination of a prior marriage of the 
employee, spouse, or widow(er). In 
these instances, the RRB must secure 
additional information to resolve 
questionable marital relationships. The 
circumstances requiring an applicant to 
submit documentary evidence of 
marriage are prescribed in 20 CFR 
219.30. 
In the absence of documentary 
evidence, the RRB needs to determine if 
a valid marriage existed between a 
spouse or widow(er) annuity applicant 
and a railroad employee. The RRB 
utilizes Forms G–124, Individual 
Statement of Marital Relationship; G– 
124a, Certification of Marriage 
Information; G–237, Statement 
Regarding Marital Status; G–238, 
Statement of Residence; and G–238a, 
Statement Regarding Divorce or 
Annulment, to secure the needed 
information. Forms G–124, G–237, G– 
238, and G–238a can be completed 
either with assistance from RRB 
personnel during an in-office interview 
or by mail. One response is requested of 
each respondent. Completion is 
required to obtain benefits. The RRB 
proposes no changes to Forms G–124, 
G–124a, G–237, G–238 and G–238a.

Title and purpose of information 
collection: Employer Service and Compensation Reports; OMB 3220– 
0070. 
Section 2(c) of the Railroad 
Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) 
(45 U.S.C.352) specifies the maximum 
normal unemployment and sickness 
benefits that may be paid in a benefit 
year. Section 2(c) further provides for 
extended benefits for certain employees 
and for beginning a benefit year early for 
other employees. The conditions for 
these actions are prescribed in 20 CFR 
302. 
All information about creditable 
railroad service and compensation 
needed by the RRB to administer 
Section 2(c) is not always available from 
annual reports filed by railroad 
employers with the RRB (OMB 3220– 
0008). When this occurs, the RRB must 
obtain supplemental information about 
service and compensation. 
The RRB utilizes Form UI–41, 
Supplemental Report of Service and 
Compensation, and Form UI–41a, Supplemental Report of Compensation, 
to obtain the additional information 
about service and compensation from 
railroad employers. Completion of the 
forms is mandatory. One response is 
required of each respondent. The RRB 
proposes the following changes to Form 
UI–41: 
€Changed last sentence in the Paperwork Reduction Act Notice to ‘‘If 
you wish, send comments regarding the 
accuracy of our estimate or any other 
aspect of this form, including

Title and purpose of information 
collection: Customer Satisfaction Monitoring; OMB 3220–0192. 
In accordance with Executive Order 
12862, the Railroad Retirement Board 
(RRB) conducts a number of customer 
surveys designed to determine the kinds 
and quality of services our beneficiaries, 
claimants, employers and members of 
the public want and expect, as well as 
their satisfaction with existing RRB 
services. The information collected is 
used by RRB management to monitor 
customer satisfaction by determining to 
what extent services are satisfactory and 
where and to what extent services can 
be improved. The surveys are limited to 
data collections that solicit strictly 
voluntary opinions, and do not collect 
information which is required or 
regulated. The information collection, 
which was first approved by the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) in 
1997, provides the RRB with a generic 
clearance authority. This generic 
authority allows the RRB to submit a 
variety of new or revised customer 
survey instruments (needed to timely 
implement customer monitoring 
activities) to the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) for expedited review 
and approval. The RRB proposes no 
changes to Form G–201.

B. RRB Computer Matches Subject to 
the Privacy Act 
We have taken appropriate action to 
ensure that all of our computer 
matching programs comply with the 
requirements of the Privacy Act, as 
amended. 
Participating Agencies 
Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) and 
the Social Security Administration 
(SSA), Match #1007. 
Authority for Conducting the Matching 
Program 
45 U.S.C. 231f(b)(7) requires SSA to 
provide wage, self-employment income, 
and other records pertinent to the 
administration of the Railroad 
Retirement Act (RRA); 45 U.S.C. 
231f(b)(4)(B)(i) provides that RRB is 
required to certify Social Security 
benefits to the Department of Treasury 
on SSA’s behalf for the agencies’ mutual 
retirees; 26 U.S.C. 6103(l)(1)(C) provides 
authority for RRB to have access to tax 
return information with respect to taxes 
imposed under chapter 22 of the 
Internal Revenue Code (IRC) for 
purposes of administering the RRA; 42 
U.S.C. 402(x)(3)(B)(iv) provides 
authority for SSA to disclose prisoner 
data to any agency administering a 
federal or federally-assisted cash, food, 
or medical assistance program; 45 
U.S.C. 231q(2) provides that earnings 
considered as compensation under the 
RRA will be considered as wages under 
the Social Security Act (Act); and the 
responsibilities of RRB and SSA with 
respect to the information obtained 
under this agreement are in accordance 
with 42 U.S.C. 402, 405(o) and 415(f); 45 
U.S.C. 231f(b)(2)(D). 
Purpose 
The RRB will, on a daily basis, obtain 
from SSA a record of the wages reported 
to SSA for persons who have applied for 
benefits under the Railroad Retirement 
Act and a record of the amount of 
benefits paid by that agency to persons 
who are receiving or have applied for 
benefits under the Railroad Retirement 
Act. The wage information is needed to 
compute the amount of the tier I annuity 
component provided by sections 3(a), 
4(a) and 4(f) of the Railroad Retirement 
Act (45 U.S.C. 231b(a), 45 U.S.C. 231c(a) 
and 45 U.S.C. 231c(f)). The benefit 
information is needed to adjust the tier 
I annuity component for the receipt of 
the Social Security benefit. This 
information is available from no other 
source. 
Second, the RRB will receive from 
SSA the amount of certain social 
security benefits which the RRB pays on 
behalf of SSA. Section 7(b)(2) of the 
Railroad Retirement Act (45 U.S.C. 
231f(b)(2)) provides that the RRB shall 
make the payment of certain social 
security benefits. The RRB also requires 
this information in order to adjust the 
amount of any annuity due to the 
receipt of a social security benefit. 
Section 10(a) of the Railroad Retirement 
Act (45 U.S.C. 231i(a)) permits the RRB 
to recover any overpayment from the 
accrual of social security benefits. This 
information is not available from any 
other source. 
Third, once a year the RRB will 
receive from SSA a copy of SSA’s 
Master Benefit Record for earmarked 
RRB annuitants. Section 7(b)(7) of the 
Railroad Retirement Act (45 U.S.C. 
231f(b)(7)) requires that SSA provide the 
requested information. The RRB needs 
this information to make the necessary 
cost-of-living computation adjustments 
quickly and accurately for those RRB 
annuitants who are also SSA 
beneficiaries. 
SSA will receive weekly from RRB 
earnings information for all railroad 
employees. SSA will match the 
identifying information of the records 
furnished by the RRB against the 
identifying information contained in its 
Master Benefit Record and its Master 
Earnings File. If there is a match, SSA 
will use the RRB earnings to adjust the 
amount of Social Security benefits in its 
Annual Earnings Reappraisal Operation. 
This information is available from no 
other source. 
The SSA will also receive daily from 
RRB earnings information on selected 
individuals. The transfer of information 
may be initiated either by RRB or by 
SSA. SSA needs this information to 
determine eligibility to Social Security 
benefits and, if eligibility is met, to 
determine the benefit amount payable. 
Section 18 of the Railroad Retirement 
Act (45 U.S.C. 231q(2)) requires that 
earnings considered as compensation 
under the Railroad Retirement Act be 
considered as wages under the Social 
Security Act for the purposes of 
determining entitlement under the 
Social Security Act if the person has 
less than 10 years of railroad service or 
has 10 or more years of service but does 
not have a current connection with the 
railroad industry at the time of his/her 
death. 
Categories of Individuals 
All applicants for benefits under the 
Railroad Retirement Act and current 
beneficiaries will have a record of any 
social security wages and the amount of 
any social security benefits furnished to 
the RRB by SSA. In addition, all persons 
who ever worked in the railroad 
industry after 1936 will have a record of 
their service and compensation 
furnished to SSA by RRB. 
Categories of Records 
1. Name, social security number, RRB 
claim number, annuity beginning date, 
date of birth, sex, last employer 
identification number, amount of daily 
pay rate, separation allowance or 
severance payment, creditable service 
and compensation after 1937, home 
address, date of death, and electronic 
mail address. 
2. Information pertaining to the 
payment or denial of an individual’s 
claim for benefits under the Railroad 
Retirement Act: name, address, social 
security number, claim number, proofs 
of age, marriage, relationship, death, 
military service, creditable earnings and 
service months (including military 
service), entitlement to benefits under 
the Social Security Act, programs 
administered by the Veterans 
Administration, or other benefit 
systems, rates, effective dates, medical 
reports, correspondence and telephone 
inquiries to and about the beneficiary, 
suspension and termination dates, 
health insurance effective date, option, 
premium rate and deduction, direct 
deposit data, employer pension 
information, citizenship status and legal 
residency status (for annuitants living 
outside the United States), and tax 
withholding information (instructions of 
annuitants regarding number of 
exemptions claimed and additional 
amounts to be withheld, as well as 
actual amounts withheld for tax 
purposes).

[Release No. 34–104380; File No. SR–MIAX– 
2025–48] 
Self-Regulatory Organizations; Miami 
International Securities Exchange, 
LLC; Notice of Filing and Immediate 
Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule 
Change To Delay Implementation of 
the Change To Amend the 
Administrative Information Subscriber 
Market Data Feed 
December 12, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
2, 2025, Miami International Securities 
Exchange, LLC (‘‘MIAX’’ or the 
‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I and II 
below, which Items have been prepared 
by the Exchange. The Commission is 
publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change 
from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to delay 
implementation of the change to amend 
the Administrative Information 
Subscriber market data feed to include 
the origin code on liquidity seeking 
event notifications. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/ 
us-options/all-options-exchanges/rule- 
filings, and at the Exchange’s principal office. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
On September 11, 2025, the Exchange 
filed a proposal to amend the 
Administrative Information Subscriber 
market data feed (‘‘AIS Feed’’) to 
include the origin code in liquidity 
seeking event notifications.
3
The 
proposed rule change indicated that the 
Exchange would announce the 
implementation date of the proposed 
rule change by Regulatory Circular to be 
published no later than 90 days 
following the operative date of the 
proposed rule. Additionally, the 
proposed rule change provided that the 
implementation date would be no later 
than 90 days following the issuance of 
the Regulatory Circular. The Exchange 
has not issued a Regulatory Circular and 
now proposes to delay the 
implementation of this functionality 
until the second quarter of 2026. 
The Exchange proposes this delay in 
order to allow the Exchange and its 
Members ample time to complete the 
necessary technical changes prior to the 
implementation of the change to the AIS 
Feed. The Exchange proposes to issue a 
Regulatory Circular notifying market 
participants at least 45 days prior to 
implementing this functionality. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
Section 6(b) of the Act
4
in general, and 
furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) 
of the Act
5
in particular, in that it is 
designed to prevent fraudulent and 
manipulative acts and practices, to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to foster cooperation and 
coordination with persons engaged in 
regulating, clearing, settling, processing 
information with respect to, and 
facilitating transactions in, securities, to 
remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanisms of a free and open market 
and a national market system and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest by allowing the 
Exchange and its Members additional 
time to implement the proposed change. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not

requires a self-regulatory organization to give the 
Commission written notice of its intent to file the 
proposed rule change, along with a brief description 
and text of the proposed rule change, at least five 
business days prior to the date of filing of the 
proposed rule change, or such shorter time as 
designated by the Commission. The Exchange has 
satisfied this requirement.

necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
Exchange’s proposal to delay the 
implementation of the proposed 
functionality does not impose an undue 
burden on competition. Delaying the 
implementation will simply allow the 
Exchange and its Members additional 
time to properly prepare for, and 
implement, the proposed functionality. 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on intramarket competition 
as the delay will apply equally to all 
Members of the Exchange. 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on intermarket competition 
as the proposal is to delay the 
implementation of approved 
functionality which affects MIAX 
Members only and does not impact 
intermarket competition. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
Written comments were neither 
solicited nor received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The Exchange has filed the proposed 
rule change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
6
and Rule 
19b–4(f)(6) thereunder.
7
Because the 
proposed rule change does not: (i) 
significantly affect the protection of 
investors or the public interest; (ii) 
impose any significant burden on 
competition; and (iii) become operative 
prior to 30 days from the date on which 
it was filed, or such shorter time as the 
Commission may designate, if 
consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest, the 
proposed rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) 
of the Act
8
and Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
9
 
thereunder. 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of such proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
under Section 19(b)(2)(B)
10
of the Act to 
determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to

arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

‘‘Qualifying liquid resources’’ is defined in 
Rule 17ad–22(a) under the Act. See 17 CFR 240.17ad–22(a). NSCC’s qualifying liquid resources 
include, for example: (1) the cash in the Clearing 
Fund; (2) the cash that would be obtained from 
NSCC’s committed 364-day credit facility with a 
consortium of lenders; (3) cash proceeds from 
NSCC’s commercial paper and extendable note 
program; and (4) cash proceeds from NSCC’s Senior 
Unsecured Notes. 
15
Section H of Procedure VII describes the 
timeline of actions that must occur in connection 
with the processing of eligible corporate 
reorganization events. The processing of mandatory 
reorganizations occurs automatically; however, the 
processing of voluntary reorganizations through the 
CNS Reorganization Processing System requires 
certain actions to be taken by both NSCC and by 
Members with positions in the subject security 
during the period of time leading up to and 
following the expiration of the event. This period 
of time is referred to in the NSCC Rules as the 
‘‘protect period’’ and is defined by reference to the 
expiration date, or ‘‘E,’’ of a voluntary 
reorganization (e.g., ‘‘E+1’’ is one day past the expiration date of the event). See NSCC Procedure VII, Section H.4(b), supra note 5. 16
The CNS automatic delivery process occurs in 
two cycles: the ‘‘night cycle,’’ which typically 
begins the night before settlement date, and the 
‘‘day cycle,’’ which occurs on settlement date. 
NSCC employs an algorithm for each cycle to 
determine the order in which Members with long 
allocations receive positions from CNS. Members 
can also submit priority requests that override 
NSCC’s algorithm when they have special needs to 
receive securities owed to them (e.g., the security is undergoing a corporate action, or the Member has 
an urgent customer delivery). 
(A) Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the 
Proposed Rule Change 
1. Purpose 
The purpose of this proposed rule 
change is to modify Addendum A (Fee 
Structure) of the NSCC Rules to (i) 
reduce the ‘‘value into the net’’ fee; (ii) 
exclude Supplemental Liquidity 
Deposits (‘‘SLD’’) from the calculation of 
the Clearing Fund Maintenance Fee; and 
(iii) eliminate the Long Broker Late 
Protect Submission Fee. The proposed 
changes to the Clearing Fund 
Maintenance Fee would be 
implemented upon filing. The proposed 
changes to the ‘‘value into the net’’ fee 
and Long Broker Late Protect 
Submission Fee would be implemented 
on January 1, 2026. The proposed fee 
changes are discussed in detail below. 
Background 
Value Into the Net Fee 
Pursuant to Section II.A. of 
Addendum A, NSCC charges Clearance 
Activity Fees for Securities Financing 
Transactions (‘‘SFT’’) and non-SFT 
transactions. For transactions excluding 
SFTs, NSCC charges a (i) ‘‘value into the 
net’’ fee of $0.46 per million of 
processed value (i.e., for CNS6
and 
Balance Order netting, the sum of the 
contract amount and any CNS fail value) 
and (ii) ‘‘value out of the net’’ fee of $ 
2.16 per million of settling value (i.e., 
the absolute value of the CNS Long and 
Short Positions). The ‘‘value into the 
net’’ fee is the value of transactions for 
which a broker is buyer or seller 
(excluding non-DTCC settling trades, 
non-CNS municipal bond transactions, 
flip trades, and foreign security trades) 
and is calculated as the gross cleared 
value prior to netting. The ‘‘value into 
the net’’ fee also includes any fails re- 
entered into CNS. The into the net value 
reflects the aggregate of each opening 
CNS security position multiplied by the 
current market price for each security.
7
 
Clearing Fund Maintenance Fee 
Pursuant to Section V.F. of 
Addendum A, NSCC charges a Clearing 
Fund Maintenance Fee, which is a 
monthly fee calculated, in arrears, as the 
product of (A) 0.35% and (B) the 
average of each Member’s cash deposit 
balance in the Clearing Fund (excluding 
cash deposit balances in any SFT 
Accounts), as of the end of each day, for 
the month, multiplied by the number of 
days for that month and divided by 360. 
The Clearing Fund Maintenance Fee 
was adopted in 2016
8
and has been 
amended several times since its 
adoption. 
NSCC’s Clearing Fund Maintenance 
Fee is primarily designed to (i) diversify 
NSCC’s revenue sources, mitigating 
NSCC’s dependence on revenues driven 
by trading volumes, and (ii) add a stable 
revenue source that would contribute to 
NSCC’s operating margin by offsetting 
increasing costs and expenses.
9
The fee 
is charged to all NSCC Members that are 
required to make deposits to the NSCC 
Clearing Fund in proportion to the 
Member’s average monthly cash deposit 
to the Clearing Fund. The calculation of 
the Clearing Fund Maintenance fee 
currently excludes any cash deposit 
balances in any SFT Accounts.
10
 
NSCC collects Clearing Fund deposits 
from its Members using a risk-based 
margin methodology.
11
These amounts 
operate, individually, as the Member’s 
margin, and the aggregate of all such 
Members’ deposits is referred to, 
collectively, as the Clearing Fund, 
which operates as NSCC’s default fund. 
All full-service NSCC Members are 
required to maintain at least a minimum 
Required Fund Deposit to the Clearing 
Fund of $250,000 at all times.
12
 
Under NSCC Rule 4A, NSCC may also 
collect additional cash deposits to the 
Clearing Fund in the form of SLD
13
to 
cover the liquidity exposures presented 
by certain Members (whether 
individually or as part of an affiliated 
Member family) whose activity 
generates liquidity needs in excess of 
NSCC’s qualifying liquid resources.
14
 
Unlike Required Fund Deposits, SLD is 
only required from those certain 
Members that present heightened 
liquidity needs at NSCC, and only for 
the duration of such liquidity exposure. 
These heightened liquidity needs 
typically occur for a limited period, 
such as those associated with large 
options expiry periods or exchange- 
trade fund index rebalancing periods. 
There is no ongoing minimum 
requirement for SLD. 
Long Broker Late Protect Submission 
Fee 
Pursuant to Section II.F.2. of 
Addendum A, NSCC charges fees to 
Members for submitting instructions in 
connection with voluntary 
reorganizations. NSCC Members holding 
long obligations in CNS for securities 
undergoing a voluntary corporate action 
may submit ‘‘protect’’ instructions to 
participate in an upcoming corporate 
action or to add shares to a voluntary 
corporate action.
15
These protect 
instructions move the Member’s long 
positions into a CNS Reorganization 
Sub-Account, which provides for a 
higher priority in NSCC’s long position 
allocation algorithm. To be included in 
night cycle processing, long Members 
(or Long Brokers) must submit their 
instructions between 9:45 p.m. and 
10:45 p.m. Eastern Time on the day 
prior to the cover protect date.
16
This 
one-hour window ensures that 
instructions are prioritized for 
allocation at the highest level. The Long 
Broker fee for submitting instructions 
during this initial window is $15 per 
instruction submitted. 
For long Members who miss this 
window, an additional submission 
period is available on the cover protect 
date between 7:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. 
Eastern Time. Instructions submitted 
during this extended window incur a 
higher fee, the Long Broker Late Protect

and regularly reviews pricing levels against costs of 
operation. See NSCC Disclosure Framework for Covered Clearing Agencies and Financial Market

Settlement Cycle). See also Securities Exchange Act

Submission Fee, designed to incentivize 
timely submission during the initial 
window on the prior day. Members that 
submit during the initial window not 
only avoid the higher Long Broker Late 
Protect Submission Fee but also ensure 
the highest priority for allocation of 
their protected long positions. The Long 
Broker Late Protect Submission Fee is 
$500 per instruction submitted. 
Proposed Fee Changes 
As part of the annual budgeting 
process, NSCC reviews price levels 
against its cost of operations and 
evaluates potential expense reductions 
and/or fee changes to correct any 
misalignment of costs and fees. NSCC’s 
fees are cost-based plus a markup as 
approved by the Board of Directors or 
management (pursuant to authority 
delegated by the Board), as applicable. 
This markup is applied to recover 
development costs and operating 
expenses and to accumulate capital 
sufficient to meet regulatory and 
economic requirements.
17
 
During the 2026 budgeting process, 
NSCC identified opportunities to better 
align fees and costs for NSCC and its 
Members. This includes (i) a proposed 
reduction of the ‘‘value into the net’’ fee; 
(ii) the removal of SLD from the 
Clearing Fund Maintenance Fee 
calculation; and (iii) the elimination of 
the Long Broker Late Protect 
Submission Fee. The proposed fee 
changes are discussed in further detail 
below. 
Value Into the Net Fee 
Based on its annal budgeting review, 
NSCC proposes to decrease its ‘‘value 
into the net’’ fee from $0.46 to $0.44 per 
million of processed value. The ‘‘value 
into the net’’ fee is the largest fee type 
for NSCC and affects all participants 
using NSCC’s trade capture and CNS 
Accounting Operation services. As a 
result, the proposed reduction in this 
fee from $0.46 to $0.44 is expected to 
result in the largest portion of the 
aggregate fee reduction. The proposed 
fee change is intended to reduce costs 
for NSCC’s Members while continuing 
to maintain sufficient revenues to cover 
NSCC’s development costs and 
operating expenses and to accumulate 
sufficient capital to meet NSCC’s 
regulatory and economic requirements. 
To effectuate the proposed fee change, 
NSCC would amend Section II.A. of 
Addendum A concerning Clearance 
Activity Fees for transactions other than 
SFTs to reflect the new ‘‘value into the 
net’’ fee of $0.44 per million. 
Clearing Fund Maintenance Fee 
NSCC proposes to exclude SLD from 
the Clearing Fund Maintenance Fee 
calculation. As noted above, the 
Clearing Fund Maintenance Fee was 
adopted to provide a diversified and 
stable revenue source for NSCC and is 
designed to be proportional to the 
average monthly cash deposit of the 
member to the Clearing Fund.
18
The 
Clearing Fund Maintenance Fee is 
primarily based on the Clearing Fund 
deposits that NSCC collects from its 
Members pursuant to NSCC Rule 4 and 
Procedure XV. As noted above, all full- 
service NSCC Members are required to 
maintain at least a minimum Required 
Fund Deposit to the Clearing Fund of 
$250,000 at all times. However, 
pursuant to NSCC Rule 4A, NSCC may 
also collect additional cash deposits to 
the Clearing Fund in the form of SLD 
from Members whose activity generates 
liquidity needs in excess of NSCC’s 
qualifying liquid resources. Unlike 
Required Fund Deposits, there is no 
ongoing minimum requirement for SLD. 
SLD is only required from those 
Members that present heightened 
liquidity needs at NSCC, and only for 
the duration of such liquidity exposure, 
which is typically limited and occurs 
during large options expiry periods or 
exchange-trade fund index rebalancing 
periods. Given the unique and 
intermittent nature of SLD, NSCC 
proposes to remove SLD balances from 
the Clearing Fund Maintenance Fee 
calculation. NSCC believes that it is 
reasonable and appropriate to calculate 
the Clearing Fund Maintenance Fee for 
its Members based on the Clearing Fund 
deposits that NSCC collects from all 
Members on an ongoing basis pursuant 
to NSCC Rule 4 and Procedure XV. 
To effectuate the proposed fee change, 
NSCC would amend Section V.F. of 
Addendum A concerning the Clearing 
Fund Maintenance Fee to clarify that 
the calculation of the average of each 
Member’s cash deposit balance in the 
Clearing Fund would exclude any cash 
deposit balances deposited to satisfy 
Supplemental Liquidity Deposit 
obligations (in addition to cash deposit 
balances in any SFT Accounts). 
Long Broker Late Protect Submission 
Fee 
Finally, NSCC proposes to eliminate 
the Long Broker Late Protect 
Submission Fee. Historically, Members 
had a longer timeframe to submit 
instructions prior to the cover protect 
date to participate in an upcoming 
corporate action. However, with the 
transition to the T+1 settlement in May 
2024,
19
this window was reduced to one 
hour (between 9:45 p.m. and 10:45 p.m. 
Eastern Time on the day prior to the 
cover protect date) prompting concerns 
from certain Members regarding the 
shortened timeframe and their ability to 
submit instructions without incurring 
the higher Long Broker Late Protect 
Submission Fee. In response to this 
feedback, NSCC is eliminating the Long 
Broker Late Protect Submission Fee. 
NSCC notes that Members are still 
strongly encouraged to submit 
instructions during the initial one-hour 
window on the day prior to the cover 
protect date to benefit from night cycle 
processing and priority allocation. 
To effectuate the proposed fee change, 
NSCC would amend Section II.F.2. of 
Addendum A to remove the Long 
Broker Late Protect Submission Fee in 
Section II.F.2.b. and modify the 
standard Long Broker protect fee to 
reflect that all input or add instructions, 
regardless of submission window, 
would be subject to a fee of $15 each. 
NSCC would also make conforming 
changes to renumber remaining fees in 
Section II.F.2. of Addendum A. 
Expected Impact 
The proposed rule change will result 
in lower fees for NSCC’s Members. 
Based on an analysis of annualized 2025 
data, the proposed change in the ‘‘value 
into the net’’ fee is expected to decrease 
NSCC’s overall annual fee revenue by 
approximately $14 million, and 
individual Member impacts are 
estimated to be approximately 4 
percent. However, each Member’s 
individual fee impact would be 
proportionate to their use of NSCC’s 
guaranteed services (e.g., trade capture and CNS). The proposed change in the 
Clearing Fund Maintenance Fee 
calculation would result in a reduction 
in fees for those Members that may be 
subject to SLD obligations at NSCC. The 
impact of this fee change would be 
dependent on the liquidity needs 
generated by each Member; however, 
based on an analysis of 2024 data, NSCC 
estimates that the inclusion of SLD in 
the Clearing Fund Maintenance Fee 
impacts fewer than ten Members and 
resulted in additional aggregate charges 
of around $1.83 million. The proposed 
change to the Long Broker Late Protect

Submission Fee would also reduce fees 
for Members by eliminating the higher 
late submission fee and applying the 
standard Long Broker protect fee to all 
input or add instructions, regardless of 
submission window. Based on an 
analysis of annualized 2025 data, the 
Long Broker Late Protect Submission 
Fee applied to fewer than ten Members 
for an aggregate total of less than 
$25,000. 
Member Outreach 
NSCC has conducted ongoing 
outreach to Members in connection with 
the proposed fee changes. As of the date 
of this filing, no written comments 
relating to the proposed rule change 
have been received in response to this 
outreach. The Commission will be 
notified of any written comments 
received. 
Implementation Timeframe 
The proposed changes to the Clearing 
Fund Maintenance Fee would be 
implemented upon filing. NSCC would 
implement the proposed changes to the 
‘‘value into the net’’ fee and Long Broker 
Late Protect Submission Fee on January 
1, 2026. 
2. Statutory Basis 
NSCC believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the 
requirements of the Act and the rules 
and regulations thereunder applicable to 
a registered clearing agency. 
Specifically, NSCC believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act
20
and 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(23)(ii)
21
thereunder for 
the reasons set forth below. 
Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act
22
 
requires that the rules of a clearing 
agency provide for the equitable 
allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and 
other charges among its participants. 
NSCC believes the proposed fee changes 
are reasonable and would be allocated 
equitably among its full-service 
Members. 
First, the proposed rule change would 
result in reduced ‘‘value into the net’’ 
fees for NSCC Members. The proposed 
‘‘value into the net’’ fee would be fairly 
applied to all Members using NSCC’s 
guaranteed services. While the impact of 
the proposed fees would vary based on 
Members’ usage of the underlying NSCC 
services, the proposed rule change 
would not alter how the Clearance 
Activity Fees are calculated or how such 
fees are allocated to Members. As 
mentioned above, the ‘‘value into the 
net’’ component of the Clearance 
Activity Fee is based on the Member’s 
gross cleared value prior to netting. As 
such, and as is currently the case, 
Members that make greater use of 
NSCC’s guaranteed services would 
generally be subject to larger ‘‘value into 
the net’’ fees and therefore would see a 
greater reduction in fees as a result of 
the proposed fee change, because such 
Members would typically have a higher 
value of gross positions prior to netting. 
Conversely, Members that use NSCC’s 
guaranteed services less would 
generally be subject to smaller ‘‘value 
into the net’’ fees, and therefore would 
see smaller fee reductions, because such 
Members would typically have a lower 
value of gross positions. The proposed 
change to the ‘‘value into the net’’ 
component of the Clearance Activity 
Fee would not adjust these allocations 
or the manner in which the fees are 
applied. As a result, NSCC believes the 
proposed fee would continue to be 
reasonable and allocated equitably 
among its Members. 
Second, the proposed rule change 
would exclude SLD from the Clearing 
Fund Maintenance Fee calculation. 
Members that are required to deposit 
SLD are already subject to the Clearance 
Fund Maintenance Fee for all cash 
balances in their full-service accounts, 
which constitute the vast majority of 
NSCC’s Clearing Fund cash balances, 
similar to all other full-service 
Members. Given the unique and 
intermittent nature of SLD, NSCC 
proposes to remove SLD balances from 
the Clearing Fund Maintenance Fee 
calculation. NSCC believes that it is 
reasonable and appropriate to calculate 
the Clearing Fund Maintenance Fee for 
its Members based on the Clearing Fund 
deposits that NSCC collects from all 
Members on an ongoing basis pursuant 
to NSCC Rule 4 and Procedure XV. As 
a result, NSCC believes the proposed fee 
would result in Clearing Fund 
Maintenance Fees that are reasonable 
and allocated equitably among its 
Members. 
Third, the proposed rule change 
would eliminate the Long Broker Late 
Protect Submission Fee. The Long 
Broker Late Protect Submission Fee 
applies to any Members submitting late 
protect instructions during the 
additional submission period on the 
cover protect date. By eliminating this 
higher late submission fee, NSCC would 
apply one standard Long Broker protect 
fee to all input or add instructions, 
regardless of submission window. As a 
result, NSCC believes the proposed fee 
change would result in Long Broker 
protect fees that are reasonable and 
allocated equitably among its Members. 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(23)(ii) under the 
Act
23
requires NSCC to establish, 
implement, maintain and enforce 
written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to provide 
sufficient information to enable 
participants to identify and evaluate the 
risks, fees, and other material costs they 
incur by participating in the covered 
clearing agency. The proposed fees 
would be clearly and transparently 
published in Addendum A of the NSCC 
Rules, which are available on a public 
website,
24
thereby enabling Members to 
identify the fees and costs associated 
with participating in NSCC. As such, 
NSCC believes the proposed rule change 
is consistent with Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(23)(ii) under the Act.
25
 
(B) Clearing Agency’s Statement on 
Burden on Competition 
Section 17A(b)(3)(I) of the Act
26
 
requires that the rules of the clearing 
agency do not impose any burden on 
competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the Act. 
NSCC does not believe the proposed 
rule change would have any impact, or 
impose any burden, on competition. 
First, the proposed change to the ‘‘value 
into the net’’ fee would result in an 
overall fee reduction for Members. The 
‘‘value into the net’’ fee would continue 
to be charged ratably based on the 
activity that each Member brings to 
NSCC. The proposed rule change would 
not adjust manner in which the fee is 
allocated or applied. Second, the 
proposed rule change would remove 
SLD balances from the Clearing Fund 
Maintenance Fee calculation. Members 
who are required to post SLD are 
already subject to the Clearance Fund 
Maintenance Fee for all cash balances in 
their full-service accounts, which 
constitute the vast majority of NSCC’s 
Clearing Fund cash balances, similar to 
all other full-service Members. The 
proposed change would result in NSCC 
calculating Clearing Fund Maintenance 
Fees based on the Clearing Fund 
deposits that NSCC collects from all 
Members on an ongoing basis pursuant 
to NSCC Rule 4 and Procedure XV. 
Finally, the proposed rule change would 
eliminate the Long Broker Late Protect 
Submission Fee and apply one standard 
Long Broker protect fee to all input or 
add instructions for all Members 
regardless of submission window. As a 
result, NSCC believes the proposed fee 
changes would apply equally to all 
Members and would not disadvantage

Self-Regulatory Organizations; The

Instituting Proceedings To Determine 
Whether To Approve or Disapprove a 
Proposed Rule Change To Amend the 
Exchange’s Rules To Enable the 
Trading of Securities on the Exchange 
in Tokenized Form 
December 12, 2025. 
I. Introduction 
On September 8, 2025, The Nasdaq 
Stock Market LLC (‘‘Nasdaq’’ or 
‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’), pursuant to Section 
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (‘‘Act’’)
1
and Rule 19b-4 
thereunder,
2
a proposed rule change to 
amend the Exchange’s rules to enable 
the trading of securities on the Exchange 
in tokenized form. The proposed rule 
change was published for comment in 
the Federal Register on September 22, 2025.
3
On November 3, 2025, pursuant 
to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
4
the 
Commission designated a longer period 
within which to approve the proposed 
rule change, disapprove the proposed 
rule change, or institute proceedings to 
determine whether to disapprove the 
proposed rule change.

This order 
institutes proceedings under Section 
19(b)(2)(B) of the Act

to determine 
whether to approve or disapprove the 
proposed rule change. 
II. Summary of the Proposal 
As described in more detail in the 
Notice,

the Exchange is proposing to 
amend its rules to enable the trading of 
equity securities and exchange traded 
products on the Exchange in tokenized 
form.

See id. Nasdaq believes that tokenizing 
securities should not occur in a manner that 
deprives issuers of their ability to determine where 
and how their shares trade. However, according to 
Nasdaq, it is limited in its ability to afford issuers 
a choice as to whether their shares are or become 
tokenized by other markets. Nevertheless, Nasdaq 
encourage the Commission to consider the issue as 
it develops a new regulatory regime for tokenized 
securities. See id. at 45428 n. 8. 13
See id. at 45429. The rule proposal does not 
address whether and how Nasdaq may choose to 
trade these non-fungible tokenized instruments in 
the future.

how Nasdaq proposes to trade tokenized 
securities. 
First, the Exchange is proposing to 
amend its definition of a security, at 
Equity 1, Section 1, to include tokenized 
securities.
9
The proposed rule change 
specifies that the term ‘‘tokenized’’ in 
this instance refers to digital 
representations of paper securities that 
utilize digital ledger or blockchain 
technology, as opposed to ‘‘traditional’’ 
securities, which are also digital 
representations of paper securities, but 
do not utilize blockchain technology.
10
 
According to the Exchange, as long as 
tokenized securities are fungible with, 
have the same CUSIP number as, and 
afford their holders the same material 
rights and privileges as do traditional 
securities of an equivalent class, the 
Exchange would trade tokenized 
securities together with traditional 
securities on the same Order Book and 
according to the same execution priority 
rules.
11
A tokenized equity security 
would be deemed to provide the same 
material rights and privileges as a 
traditional security if, among other 
things, it conveys an equity interest in 
an underlying company, a right to 
receive any dividends that the company 
issues to its shareholders, a right to 
exercise any voting rights that 
shareholders are due, and a right to 
receive a share of the residual assets of 
the company upon liquidation.
12
The 
Exchange would not treat tokenized 
instruments to be equivalent to their 
traditional counterparts if they do not 
convey such rights, in whole or in 
material part, or share the same CUSIP, 
but instead the Exchange would treat 
these instruments as distinct (e.g., 
derivative securities or ADRs).
13
 
Second, the Exchange is proposing to 
amend its Order Entry Rule, at Equity 4, 
Rule 4756, to describe how a 
Participant
14
can communicate its 
desire to clear and settle a security in 
tokenized form.
15
The proposed 
amended Rule states that a Participant 
that wishes for its order to clear and 
settle in tokenized form must notate its 
preference upon entry of the order in 
the System
16
by selecting a flag that the 
Exchange designates for this purpose, in 
accordance with the Exchange’s 
procedures.
17
When a Participant enters 
an order with the tokenization flag 
selected, the Exchange will 
communicate the Participant’s order 
handling instruction to The Depository 
Trust Company (‘‘DTC’’) on a post-trade 
basis.
18
DTC would then carry out the 
Participant’s instruction in accordance 
with DTC’s rules, policies, and 
procedures, or if it is unable to do so, 
it would make alternative clearing and 
settlement arrangements with the 
Participant.
19
 
Third, the Exchange is proposing to 
amend its Book Processing Rule, at 
Equity 4, Rule 4757, to specify that if an 
order contains tokenized securities or 
indicates a preference to clear and settle 
securities in token form, it would not 
affect the priority in which the 
Exchange executes that order.
20
 
Fourth, the Exchange is proposing to 
amend its Order Routing Rule, at Equity 
4, Rule 4758, to state that when the 
Exchange routes orders that Participants 
have designated for clearing and 
settlement in token form, in accordance 
with the Exchange’s order entry rules 
and procedures, then the Exchange will 
communicate this tokenization 
instruction to DTC upon receiving an 
execution for an order that was routed 
to another trading venue.
21
 
Nasdaq represents that apart from the 
above, as far as Nasdaq’s systems and 
matching engine are concerned, the 
Exchange’s trading procedures and 
behavior will be the same regardless of 
whether a member opts to trade 
tokenized or traditional shares of a 
stock.
22
The proposed rule change to 
offer trading in tokenized securities 
would become effective once the 
requisite infrastructure and post-trade 
settlement services have been 
established by DTC, with any required 
regulatory approvals having been 
obtained.
23
It is Nasdaq’s understanding 
that DTC is working to develop the 
necessary infrastructure, services, and 
procedures to facilitate such 
tokenization and the related post-trade 
settlement infrastructure and services.
24
 
The post-trade settlement services, 
including the eligibility of a member’s 
orders to be settled in tokenized form, 
would be determined by DTC’s policies 
and procedures.
25
 
III. Proceedings To Determine Whether 
To Approve or Disapprove SR– 
NASDAQ–2025–072 and Grounds for 
Disapproval Under Consideration 
The Commission is instituting 
proceedings pursuant to Section 
19(b)(2)(B) of the Act
26
to determine 
whether the proposed rule change 
should be approved or disapproved. 
Institution of proceedings is appropriate 
at this time in view of the legal and 
policy issues raised by the proposed 
rule change. Institution of proceedings 
does not indicate that the Commission 
has reached any conclusions with 
respect to any of the issues involved. 
Rather, the Commission seeks and 
encourages interested persons to 
provide comments on the proposed rule 
change. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the 
Act,
27
the Commission is providing 
notice of the grounds for disapproval 
under consideration. The Commission is 
instituting proceedings to allow for 
additional analysis of the proposed rule 
change’s consistency with the Act and, 
in particular, with (1) Section 6(b)(5) of 
the Act,
28
which requires, among other 
things, that the rules of a national 
securities exchange be designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative 
acts and practices, to promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, to foster 
cooperation and coordination with 
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, 
settling, processing information with 
respect to, and facilitating transactions 
in securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest, and (2) 
Section 6(b)(8) of the Act, which 
requires that the Exchange’s rules do not 
impose any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act.
29
 
The Commission asks that 
commenters address the sufficiency of 
the Exchange’s statements in support of 
the proposal, which are set forth in the 
Notice, in addition to any other 
comments they may wish to submit 
about the proposed rule change. In 
particular, the Commission seeks 
comment on whether the proposal to

Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, as amended by the 
Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Pub. L. 94–

Self-Regulatory Organizations; NYSE 
American LLC; Notice of Filing of 
Proposed Rule Change To Amend 
Section 1003 of the NYSE American 
Company Guide 
December 12, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1)
1
of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’)
2
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
3
 
notice is hereby given that, on December 
3, 2025, NYSE American LLC (‘‘NYSE 
American’’ or the ‘‘Exchange’’) filed 
with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ‘‘Commission’’) the 
proposed rule change as described in 
Items I, II, and III below, which Items 
have been prepared by the self- 
regulatory organization. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Section 1003 of the NYSE American 
Company Guide (the ‘‘Company Guide’’) 
to establish that an issuer must maintain 
a certain global market capitalization 
and trading price per share in order to 
remain listed on the Exchange. The 
proposed rule change is available on the 
Exchange’s website at www.nyse.com, 
and at the principal office of the 
Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
self-regulatory organization included 
statements concerning the purpose of, 
and basis for, the proposed rule change 
and discussed any comments it received 
on the proposed rule change. The text 
of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. 
The Exchange has prepared summaries, 
set forth in sections A, B, and C below, 
of the most significant parts of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
Section 1003 of the Company Guide 
sets forth minimum quantitative and 
qualitative continued listing standards 
for securities listed on the Exchange. 
Issuers of common stock are required to 
maintain certain quantitative minimum 
standards related to stockholders’ 
equity,
4
publicly held shares,
5
public 
shareholders
6
and aggregate market 
value of publicly held shares.
7
In 
addition, Section 1003 also sets forth 
qualitative continued listing standards 
related to, among other things, 
operations contrary to public interest
8
 
and reduction of operations.
9
 
While the Exchange believes that its 
existing rules provide meaningful 
assurance that only financially sound 
and quality issuers remain listed on the 
Exchange, it has noticed a recent 
increase in companies that have either 
a (i) very small market capitalization, or 
(ii) very low trading price per share. The 
Exchange believes that an issuer having 
one or both of these characteristics is 
potentially susceptible to manipulation 
and more likely to experience trading 
volatility in its shares. As such, the 
Exchange now proposes to amend 
Section 1003 to specify that an issuer 
must maintain a certain global market 
capitalization and trading price per

Section 1003(b)(i)(C) states that a class of 
common stock will be subject to suspension and 
delisting if its aggregate market value of shares 
publicly held is less than $1,000,000 for more than 
90 consecutive days.

share in order to remain listed on the 
Exchange. 
Minimum Market Capitalization 
Section 1003(b)(i) of the Company 
Guide enumerates circumstances where 
a class of common stock has sufficiently 
limited distribution of shares so as to 
warrant suspension and delisting. While 
reduced value of publicly held shares is 
grounds for suspension and delisting,
10
 
Section 1003(b)(i) does not contain a 
minimum market capitalization 
requirement. The Exchange now 
proposes to adopt new rule 1003(b)(i)(D) 
to specify that a company’s class of 
common stock will be subject to 
immediate suspension and delisting if it 
has an average global market 
capitalization over a consecutive 30 
trading-day period is less than 
$5,000,000. The Exchange further 
proposes that a company falling below 
this standard will not be eligible to 
submit a compliance plan pursuant to 
Section 1009 of the Company Guide. 
The Exchange believes it is 
appropriate to adopt a minimum market 
capitalization standard for continued 
listing because, in its experience, a 
company with a sustained market 
capitalization below $5,000,000 is likely 
to be financially distressed and is 
increasingly susceptible to 
manipulation due to its small size. 
Accordingly, the Exchange does not 
believe that a company fitting this 
profile is appropriate for continued 
listing on the Exchange. The Exchange 
proposes to specify that a company 
subject to suspension and delisting for 
falling below proposed Section 
1003(b)(i)(D) will not be eligible to 
follow the procedures to regain 
compliance set forth in Section 1009. In 
the Exchange’s experience, a company 
trading at a sustained market 
capitalization below $5,000,000 is 
unlikely to regain financial stability and 
it is therefore appropriate to subject it to 
immediate suspension and delisting. 
Minimum Trading Price 
Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company 
Guide states that the Exchange will 
consider initiating suspension and 
delisting procedures when a class of 
common stock is selling for a substantial 
period of time at a low price per share 
and its issuer fails to effect a reverse 
stock split to raise the per share trading 
price. In applying this rule, Exchange 
staff seeks to have proactive discussions 
with any issuer whose stock is trading 
below $1.00 and initiates suspension 
and delisting when a stock trades below 
$0.10 per share. Recently, the Exchange 
has become aware of an increasing 
industry-wide trend of low-priced 
stocks trading on national securities 
exchanges. The Exchange believes that 
low priced stocks have a greater chance 
of being manipulated or experiencing 
trading volatility. Accordingly, the 
Exchange believes it is appropriate to 
establish a minimum trading price for a 
security to remain listed on the 
Exchange. 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Section 1003(f)(v) to specify that if a 
security’s close price per share is less 
than $0.25 (the ‘‘Minimum Trading 
Price’’) on any trading day, the 
Exchange will immediately suspend 
trading and commence delisting 
proceedings. In the Exchange’s 
experience securities that trade at 
abnormally low prices are typically 
unable to recover to any meaningful 
degree. Accordingly, the Exchange 
proposes to specify in Section 1003(f)(v) 
that a security that closes below the 
Minimum Trading Price will not be 
entitled to submit a plan to regain 
compliance pursuant to Section 1009 of 
the Company Guide. The Exchange 
proposes to make this change effective 
October 1, 2026. Providing a transition 
period before the rule is effective will 
afford issuers time to implement reverse 
stock splits to increase their share price 
before the new requirement is in place. 
The Exchange notes that its rules 
prohibiting one or more reverse stock 
splits with a cumulative ratio of 200 
shares or more to one in a two-year 
period will remain in place.
11
 
The Exchange also proposes to clarify 
that, consistent with its general 
authority under Section 1002(e) of the 
Company Guide to suspend trading in 
the event of any condition that makes 
further dealings on the Exchange 
unwarranted, it may suspend trading in 
a security that has experienced a 
precipitous decline and is at an 
abnormally low level even if such 
security has not fallen below the 
Minimum Trading Price at the market 
close. In the Exchange’s experience, 
under those conditions a security’s 
trading price is generally unable to 
recover and it is appropriate for the 
Exchange to take action. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(the ‘‘Act’’) generally
12
and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act
13
 
in particular, in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and in general to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
In particular, the Exchange believes 
that establishing a minimum market 
capitalization and Minimum Trading 
Price for securities listed on the 
Exchange is designed to protect 
investors and the public interest and to 
remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system because 
the Exchange believes that companies 
with small market capitalization or with 
a very low price per share are more 
susceptible to trading volatility and 
market manipulation. By adopting clear 
standards that prohibit such companies 
from remaining listed on the Exchange, 
the Exchange is therefore protecting 
investors and the public interest. 
The Exchange has observed that the 
challenges facing companies with 
market capitalizations below $5 million 
generally are not temporary and 
therefore immediate suspension from 
trading is warranted as a compliance 
period is unlikely to provide a sustained 
path to regaining compliance with 
Exchange rules. Further, a market 
capitalization below $5 million can be 
a leading indicator of other financial 
concerns. 
As discussed above, the Exchange 
believes that securities that trade below 
the Minimum Trading Price are more 
susceptible to trading volatility and 
market manipulation. The Exchange 
believes it is appropriate to establish a 
clear continued listing standard in this 
regard to limit the likelihood of 
problematic trading and provide clarity 
to listed issuers. Further, the Exchange 
believes it is appropriate to provide 
issuers with a transition period before 
effectiveness of the Minimum Trading 
Price requirement to afford time to 
implement a reverse stock split in 
anticipation of the new requirement. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
Exchange notes that the proposed 
amendments would establish minimum 
market capitalization and trading price 
standards for issuers listed on the 
Exchange. The Exchange believes that

certain market data feed descriptions and fees). 
issuers with very small market 
capitalization and securities that trade 
at very low prices are more likely to 
experience trading volatility and 
potentially be the subject of 
manipulation. The Exchange believes it 
is appropriate to address these concerns 
with the adoption of clear continued 
listing standards. The Exchange does 
not believe its proposed rules would 
impose any burden on competition as 
all exchanges that list equity securities 
maintain a set of continued listing 
standards appropriate for companies 
listed on their respective exchange.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Nasdaq

Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed 
Rule Change To Adopt Fees for the 
Trades and Spread Feeds 
December 12, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
5, 2025, Nasdaq PHLX LLC (‘‘Phlx’’ or 
‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III, below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to adopt fees 
for two newly established data feeds, 
the Trades Feed and the Spread Feed. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/phlx/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The purpose of the proposal is to 
adopt fees for two data feeds, the Trades 
Feed and the Spread Feed. While these 
amendments are effective upon filing, 
the Exchange has designated the 
proposed amendments to be operative 
on January 1, 2026.
3
 
The Trades Feed and the Spread Feed 
are recently established data feeds for 
the Phlx exchange.
4
These two new 
feeds, together with changes to three 
existing feeds—the Nasdaq Phlx Top of 
Market Feed, the Nasdaq Phlx Order 
Feed, and the Nasdaq Phlx Depth of 
Market Feed—are designed to 
harmonize the market data feed 
structure of the Phlx exchange with 
those of its affiliates ISE and MRX. 
Nasdaq believes that this 
harmonization will allow customers to 
ingest data more efficiently and to tailor 
their purchase to only the data they 
need. 
Ingestion of data will become more 
efficient because customers will be able 
to transition from multiple exchange 
formats to a single format for all Nasdaq 
exchanges, resulting in more efficient 
ingestion of data and possible cost 
savings. This is a change from current 
practice, in which each exchange offers 
its own unique set of market data feeds, 
requiring subscribers to separately 
program their systems to ingest 
information from each market. The new 
format also allows customers to

Nasdaq noted in its product filing for the Trades 
Feed that it intended to propose a separate fee for 
the Trades Feed at a later date. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 104049 (September 25, 
2025), 90 FR 47096 (September 30, 2025) (SR–Phlx–

‘‘A ‘distributor’ of Exchange data is any entity 
that receives a feed or data file of Exchange data 
directly from the Exchange or indirectly through 
another entity and then distributes it either 
internally (within that entity) or externally (outside 
that entity). All distributors shall execute an 
Exchange distributor agreement. The Exchange 
itself is a vendor of its data feed(s) and has executed 
an Exchange distributor agreement and pays the 
distributor charge.’’ Equity 7, Section 3.

Market share is the percentage of volume on a 
particular exchange relative to the total volume 
across all exchanges and indicates the amount of 
order flow directed to that exchange. High levels of 
market share enhance the value of trading and 
ports. Total contracts include both multi-list 
options and proprietary options products. 
Proprietary options products are products with 
intellectual property rights that are not multi-listed. 
Phlx lists proprietary products. 
configure hardware to balance system 
loads more efficiently. 
The new feed structure will also allow 
customers to tailor their purchase to 
only the data they need. A customer that 
only needs last sale information, for 
example, would be able to purchase the 
Trades Feed as a standalone feed 
without being required to also purchase 
a best bid and offer feed. This is more 
efficient and cost effective than 
requiring customers to purchase a 
bundled feed with multiple types of 
information, possibly including 
information that the customer neither 
wants nor needs. 
The new Phlx format is the same as 
that used for the ISE and MRX 
exchanges. Nasdaq is planning to 
submit future proposals to conform the 
BX Exchange and the Nasdaq Options 
Market to this format. 
Trades Feed 
Nasdaq Phlx Trades Feed (‘‘Trades 
Feed’’) displays last trade information. 
The data provided for each option series 
includes the symbols (series and 
underlying security), put or call 
indicator, expiration date, the strike 
price of the series, whether the option 
series is available for trading on Phlx, 
and identifies whether the series is 
available for closing transactions only. 
Prior to the harmonization of market 
data feeds across the Phlx, ISE, GEMX 
and MRX markets, last sale information 
had been offered in the Nasdaq Phlx 
Top of Market (‘‘TOPO’’) data feed. 
The Exchange currently offers the 
Trades Feed for no additional cost with 
the purchase of TOPO. 
The Exchange proposes to establish a 
fee for the Trades Feed of $1,000 per 
month for unlimited internal and/or 
external distribution. This will allow 
the customer to choose whether or not 
to purchase last sale information on a 
standalone basis or together with 
TOPO.
5
 
Spread Feed 
Nasdaq Phlx Spread Feed (‘‘Spread 
Feed’’) provides information on 
complex orders. It consists of: (1) 
options orders for all Complex Orders 
(i.e., spreads, buy-writes, delta neutral strategies, etc.); (2) full Complex Order 
depth information, including prices, 
side, size, capacity, Attributable 
Complex Order tags when provided by 
a member or member organization, and 
order attributes (e.g., OCC account number, give-up information, CMTA 
information), for individual Complex 
Orders on the Exchange book; (3) last 
trades information; and (4) a calculation 
of Phlx’s complex best bid and offer 
position, with aggregated size (including 
total size in aggregate, for Professional 
Order size in the aggregate and Public 
Customer Order size in the aggregate), 
based on displayable Complex Order 
interest in the System. The feed also 
provides Complex Order auction 
notifications. 
While some of the information on the 
Spread Feed was included in the Order 
Feed prior to harmonization, the new 
Spread Feed also includes additional 
information not previously distributed 
by the Exchange. The old Order Feed 
had provided some information on 
complex orders (option order 
comprising of one or more legs), such as 
order messages, updates on resting 
orders, and auction notification 
messages. The new Spread Feed 
includes this information, but also 
significantly enhances customer insight 
into complex orders by associating top 
of market, order, depth of market and 
trade information with a unique strategy 
identification number that will allow 
customers to identify different stages of 
a trade as elements of a single complex 
order, providing market participants 
with much greater transparency into 
complex order activity. Such 
information is already an integral part of 
the feeds available on the MRX and ISE 
exchanges. 
The Exchange currently offers the 
Spread Feed for no additional cost with 
the purchase of the Order Feed. 
The Exchange proposes to charge 
$3,100 per month per distributor for 
unlimited internal and/or external 
distribution of the Phlx Spread Feed.
6
 
This fee will allow the customer to 
choose whether or not to purchase the 
complex order information available on 
the Spread Feed together with the 
simple order information on the Order 
Feed or as a standalone feed.
7
 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
8
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
9
in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges 
among members and issuers and other 
persons using any facility, and is not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. This belief 
is based on the fact that the proposal 
will enhance our market data products 
while at the same time maintaining fees 
that are comparable to those charged by 
similarly situated options exchanges. 
The experience of other exchanges 
show that many customers will take 
advantage of the ability to purchase the 
TOPO feed and the Trades Feed 
separately. Our experience with the ISE 
Exchange—which already offers a trades 
feed that is distinct from its top of book 
feed—shows that nearly a third of 
customers take either take the top of 
market feed only (approximately 17%) 
or the trades feed only (about 14%), 
while the remaining customers take 
both. We expect the same pattern to 
hold true for Phlx—about a third of 
customers will take one feed or the 
other, ingesting less data than would be 
required for a combined feed, and the 
remaining customers to take both feeds. 
We also expect customers to take 
advantage of the opportunity to 
purchase the Order Feed and the Spread 
feed separately, rather than bundled as 
part of a single product. The ISE 
exchange currently offers an Order Feed 
and a Spread Feed configured in a 
similar manner. Our experience with 
the ISE Exchange shows that 
approximately 45% of customers take 
either the Spread Feed only 
(approximately 39%) or the Order Feed 
only (about 7%), while the remaining 
customers take both. We expect the 
same pattern to hold true for Phlx— 
somewhat less than half the customers 
will take one feed or the other, while the 
remaining customers will take both.

Trades Feed 
The data feed formats used by Phlx, 
ISE, and MRX, composed of five 
different feeds—TOPO, the Order Feed, 
the Depth of Market Feed, the Trades 
Feed, and the Spread Feed—are unique 
to the Nasdaq options exchanges. In 
particular, no exchange unaffiliated 
with Nasdaq offers a Trades Feed, and 
therefore no comparison with exchanges 
not affiliated with Nasdaq is possible. 
Comparing the proposed Trades Feed 
fees to those of the Nasdaq affiliates 
offering this feed shows that the 
proposed fees are comparable to, or less 
than, the fees charged by the Nasdaq 
affiliates for that product, based on 
market share. 
Exchange Market share 
(%) Trades Feed 
Phlx ......................................9.7  $1,000/month internal and external distribution. ISE ........................................6.8  $1,040/month internal and external distribution. MRX .....................................3.2  $757/month internal distribution, $1,010/month external distribution. GEMX ...................................3.8  $520/month internal and external distribution. ISE: The proposed fees for the Phlx Trades Feed of $1,000 per month for 
internal and external distribution are 
less than the current ISE fees of $1,040 
per month for internal and external 
distribution.
11
The difference is even 
larger relative to market share, as Phlx 
has a market share of 9.7% as compared 
to ISE’s market share of 6.8%. 
MRX: The proposed fees for the Phlx Trades Feed of $1,000 per month for 
internal and external distribution are 
less than the combined MRX fees of 
$757 per month for internal distribution 
and $1,010 per month for external 
distribution, and also less than the MRX 
fee of $1,010 for external distribution.

applicable to the new fees proposed herein.

not be applicable to the new fees proposed herein. 
14
ISE Rulebook, Options 7, Section 10(I) (Nasdaq 
ISE Spread Feed). These are fees for 2025. As noted 
above, fees for the ISE Trade Feed are scheduled to 
be adjusted in 2026 and 2027 to account for the 
impact of past inflation. The proposed Phlx fees 
will not be adjusted for past inflation, which would 
not be applicable to new fees proposed herein.

MRX Rulebook, Options 7, Distributor Fees, 
Section 7(5) (Spread Feed). These are fees for 2025. 
Fees for the MRX Trade Feed are scheduled to be

applicable to the new fees proposed herein. 
16
15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(ii). 
While MRX charges less than the 
proposed Phlx fee for internal 
distribution, fees are nevertheless 
comparable relative to market share 
because Phlx has a market share of 9.7% 
as compared to 3.2% for MRX). 
GEMX: The proposed fees for the Trades Feed are comparable to those 
charged by GEMX based on relative 
market share. While the proposed Phlx 
fees of $1,000 per month for internal 
and external distribution are greater 
than GEMX’s fees of $520 per month for 
internal and external distribution,
13
fees 
are nevertheless comparable relative to 
market share because Phlx has a market 
share (9.7% as compared to 3.8% for 
GEMX). 
Spread Feed 
The proposed fees for the Spread Feed 
are comparable to, or less than, the fees 
charged by Nasdaq affiliates ISE and 
MRX based on market share. No 
exchange unaffiliated with Nasdaq 
offers a Spread Feed, and neither does 
GEMX, and therefore no comparison 
with other exchanges is possible. 
Exchange Market share 
(%) Spread feed 
Phlx ......................................9.7  $3,100/month internal and/or external distribution. ISE ........................................6.8  $3,100/month internal and/or external distribution. MRX .....................................3.2  $1,010/month internal distribution, $1,515/month external distribution. ISE: The proposed fees for the Phlx Trades Feed of $3,100/month internal 
and/or external distribution are the 
same as current ISE fees.
14
Given that 
Phlx has a market share nearly 50 
percent higher than that of ISE (9.7% for 
Phlx as compared to 6.8% for ISE), the 
proposed fees are lower than ISE fees 
relative to market share. 
MRX: The proposed fees for the Phlx Trades Feed of $3,100/month internal 
and/or external distribution are greater 
than the current MRX fees of $1,010 for 
internal distribution and $1,515 for 
external distribution ($2,525 for internal 
and external distribution).
15
However, 
Phlx has a market share nearly four 
times greater than that of MRX (9.7% for 
Phlx relative to 3.2% for MRX), much 
greater than the fee differential for the 
Trades Feed, and therefore the proposed 
fees are comparable to those of MRX 
relative to market share. 
No Unfair Discrimination 
The Proposal is not unfairly 
discriminatory. The proposed feeds are 
optional data fees available to all market 
participants on a non-discriminatory 
basis. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
Nothing in the proposal burdens 
inter-market competition (the 
competition among self-regulatory 
organizations) because approval of the 
proposal does not impose any burden 
on the ability of other options exchanges 
to compete. The proposed fees for the 
Spread Feed and the Trades Feed are 
comparable to, and in some cases less 
than, those of the other exchanges that 
offer them relative to market share, as 
discussed above. 
Nothing in the Proposal burdens 
intra-market competition (the 
competition among consumers of 
exchange data), because the Spread 
Feed and the Trades Feed are available 
to any market participant at the same 
price and any market participant that 
elects to purchase either the Spread 
Feed or the Trades Feed may do so on 
a non-discriminatory basis. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act.
16
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is: (i) necessary or appropriate in 
the public interest; (ii) for the protection 
of investors; or (iii) otherwise in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
If the Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’)

and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,

notice is hereby given that on December 
1, 2025, New York Stock Exchange LLC 
(‘‘NYSE’’ or the ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with 
the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (‘‘Commission’’) the 
proposed rule change as described in 
Items I, II, and III below, which Items 
have been prepared by the Exchange. 
The Commission is publishing this 
notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change from interested 
persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
Price List to adopt an alternative 
requirement to qualify for the Non 
Display Tier 1 pricing. The Exchange 
proposes to implement the fee change 
effective December 1, 2025. The 
proposed rule change is available on the 
Exchange’s website at www.nyse.com 
and at the principal office of the 
Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
self-regulatory organization included 
statements concerning the purpose of, 
and basis for, the proposed rule change 
and discussed any comments it received 
on the proposed rule change. The text 
of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. 
The Exchange has prepared summaries, 
set forth in sections A, B, and C below, 
of the most significant parts of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
Price List to adopt an alternative 
requirement to qualify for the Non 
Display Tier 1 pricing. 
The proposed change responds to the 
current competitive environment by 
incentivizing submission of additional 
liquidity in Tapes A, B and C securities 
to a public exchange. 
The Exchange proposes to implement 
the fee change effective December 1, 
2025. 
Background 
Current Market and Competitive 
Environment 
The Exchange operates in a highly 
competitive market. The Commission 
has repeatedly expressed its preference 
for competition over regulatory 
intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities 
markets. In Regulation NMS, the 
Commission highlighted the importance 
of market forces in determining prices 
and SRO revenues and, also, recognized 
that current regulation of the market 
system ‘‘has been remarkably successful 
in promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
3
 
While Regulation NMS has enhanced 
competition, it has also fostered a 
‘‘fragmented’’ market structure where 
trading in a single stock can occur 
across multiple trading centers. When 
multiple trading centers compete for 
order flow in the same stock, the 
Commission has recognized that ‘‘such 
competition can lead to the 
fragmentation of order flow in that 
stock.’’
4
Indeed, cash equity trading is 
currently dispersed across 17 
exchanges,
5
numerous alternative 
trading systems,
6
and broker-dealer 
internalizers and wholesalers, all 
competing for order flow. Based on 
publicly-available information, no 
single exchange currently has more than 
20% market share.
7
Therefore, no 
exchange possesses significant pricing 
power in the execution of cash equity 
order flow. More specifically, the 
Exchange’s share of executed volume of 
equity trades in Tapes A, B and C 
securities is less than 12%.
8
 
The Exchange believes that the ever- 
shifting market share among the 
exchanges from month to month 
demonstrates that market participants 
can move order flow, or discontinue or 
reduce use of certain categories of 
products. While it is not possible to 
know a firm’s reason for shifting order 
flow, the Exchange believes that one 
such reason is because of fee changes at 
any of the registered exchanges or non- 
exchange venues to which the firm 
routes order flow. Accordingly, 
competitive forces compel the Exchange 
to use exchange transaction fees and 
credits because market participants can 
readily trade on competing venues if 
they deem pricing levels at those other 
venues to be more favorable. 
In response to this competitive 
environment, the Exchange has 
established incentives for its member 
organizations who submit orders that 
add liquidity on the Exchange. The 
Exchange believes that the proposed 
change will incentivize submission of 
additional liquidity in Tape A, Tape B 
and Tape C securities to a public 
exchange, thereby promoting price 
discovery and transparency and 
enhancing order execution 
opportunities for member organizations. 
Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange currently provides a 
credit of $0.0018 per share to member 
organizations that send orders that add 
liquidity to the Exchange in Non- 
Displayed Limit Orders with a per share 
stock price of $1.00 or more and that 
have Adding ADV in Non-Displayed 
Limit Orders that is at least 0.15% of 
Tapes A, B, and C CADV combined, 
excluding any liquidity added by a 
DMM. Further, member organizations 
that send orders that add liquidity to the

For instance, Cboe BZX offers a higher tiered 
rebate based on a lower adding requirement if the 
member is enrolled in a minimum number of LMM 
securities. See Cboe BZX Equities Fee Schedule, available at https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, 2005), 70 FR 37495, 37499 (June 29, 2005) 
(S7–10–04) (Final Rule) (‘‘Regulation NMS’’). 
13
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 61358, 75 FR 3594, 3597 (January 21, 2010) (File No. S7– 
02–10) (Concept Release on Equity Market 
Structure). 
Exchange in Non-Displayed Limit 
Orders and that have Adding ADV in 
Non-Displayed Limit Orders that is at 
least 0.15% of Tapes A, B and C CADV 
combined, excluding any liquidity 
added by a DMM, are provided a credit 
equal to 0.18% of the total dollar value 
of the transaction for securities with a 
per share stock price below $1.00. 
With this proposed rule change, the 
Exchange proposes to adopt an 
alternative requirement for member 
organizations to qualify for the Non 
Display Tier 1 credits. As proposed, 
member organizations that are also 
DMMs registered as a DMM in at least 
500 Tape A issues would receive a 
credit of $0.0018 per share in securities 
with a per share stock price of $1.00 or 
more, or a credit equal to 0.18% of the 
total dollar value of the transaction for 
securities with a per share stock price 
below $1.00. 
The purpose of this proposed change 
is to incentivize member organizations 
that are also DMMs to register as a DMM 
in a greater number of Tape A issues 
and thereby, qualify for the Non Display 
Tier 1 credit. The Exchange believes 
that it is reasonable to offer credits 
based on the member organizations that 
are also DMMs in a certain number of 
securities. The Exchange notes that 
other marketplaces offer incremental 
credits to members that are lead market 
makers registered in a minimum 
number of securities and that add a 
specified percentage of displayed 
liquidity.
9
The Exchange further 
believes that eligibility for the credit for 
member organizations that are also 
DMMs in a certain number of securities 
is not unfairly discriminatory because 
member organizations that are not 
DMMs can still qualify for the credit by 
sending adding liquidity to the 
Exchange and meeting the ADV 
requirements for all Tapes set out in the 
Non Display Tier 1 pricing table. 
The proposed changes are not 
otherwise intended to address other 
issues, and the Exchange is not aware of 
any significant problems that market 
participants would have in complying 
with the proposed changes. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
Section 6(b) of the Act,
10
in general, and 
furthers the objectives of Sections 
6(b)(4) and (5) of the Act,
11
in particular, 
because it provides for the equitable 
allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and 
other charges among its members, 
issuers and other persons using its 
facilities and does not unfairly 
discriminate between customers, 
issuers, brokers or dealers. 
The Proposed Change Is Reasonable 
As discussed above, the Exchange 
operates in a highly competitive market. 
The Commission has repeatedly 
expressed its preference for competition 
over regulatory intervention in 
determining prices, products, and 
services in the securities markets. In 
Regulation NMS, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO 
revenues and, also, recognized that 
current regulation of the market system 
‘‘has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
12
 
While Regulation NMS has enhanced 
competition, it has also fostered a 
‘‘fragmented’’ market structure where 
trading in a single stock can occur 
across multiple trading centers. When 
multiple trading centers compete for 
order flow in the same stock, the 
Commission has recognized that ‘‘such 
competition can lead to the 
fragmentation of order flow in that 
stock.’’
13
 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposal to offer the Non Display Tier 
1 rebate to member organizations that 
are also DMMs registered as a DMM in 
at least 500 Tape A securities is a 
reasonable means to attract greater 
participation by member organizations 
that are also DMMs and to register as a 
DMM in a greater number of securities. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is a reasonable means to 
improve market quality, attract 
additional order flow to a public market, 
and enhance execution opportunities for 
member organizations on the Exchange, 
to the benefit of all market participants. 
The Exchange notes that the proposal 
would also foster liquidity provision 
and stability in the marketplace. The 
proposal would also reward DMM units, 
who have greater risks and heightened 
quoting and other obligations than other 
market participants. The proposed 
change is also a reasonable attempt to 
potentially attract additional DMM units 
to the Exchange by providing financial 
incentives to register as DMMs in a 
greater number of securities. Moreover, 
offering credits to member organizations 
that are also DMMs registered as a DMM 
in 500 Tape A symbols is a reasonable 
method to incentivize greater 
participation by such member 
organizations, thereby contributing to 
depth and market quality on the 
Exchange. In light of the competitive 
environment in which the Exchange 
currently operates, the proposed rule 
change is a reasonable attempt to 
incentivize member organizations to 
increase their participation on the 
Exchange and provide meaningful 
added levels of liquidity in order to 
qualify for credits, thereby contributing 
to depth and market quality on the 
Exchange. 
The Proposal Is an Equitable Allocation 
of Fees 
The Exchange believes the proposal 
equitably allocates fees and credits 
among market participants because all 
member organizations that are also 
DMMs may qualify for the Non Display 
Tier 1 credits on an equal basis. 
The Exchange believes the proposal 
equitably allocates its fees among its 
market participants by fostering 
liquidity provision and stability in the 
marketplace. Moreover, the proposal is 
an equitable allocation of fees because it 
would reward DMM units for their 
increased risks and heightened quoting 
and other obligations. As such, it is 
equitable to offer qualifying member 
organizations that are also DMMs 
registered as a DMM a higher credit for 
Non-Displayed Limit Orders. The 
proposed rebate is also equitable 
because it would apply equally to any 
member organization that is also a DMM 
registered as a DMM in a minimum 
number of Tape A securities. The 
Exchange notes that at this time there 
are currently 3 member organizations 
that are also DMMs registered as a DMM 
in at least 500 Tape A issues that could 
qualify for the Non Display Tier 1 
credits. The Exchange believes that the 
proposal would provide an equal 
incentive to any member organization 
that is a DMM to register as a DMM in 
a greater number of Tape A issues, and 
that the proposal constitutes an 
equitable allocation of fees because all 
similarly situated member organizations 
would be eligible for the same rebate. 
The Exchange notes that member 
organizations that are not a DMM 
registered in 500 Tape A issues can 
continue to qualify for Non Display Tier 
1 credits pursuant to the current 
requirements.

The Proposal Is Not Unfairly 
Discriminatory 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposal is not unfairly discriminatory. 
In the prevailing competitive 
environment, member organizations are 
free to disfavor the Exchange’s pricing if 
they believe that alternatives offer them 
better value. The Exchange believes that 
offering a rebate to member 
organizations that are also a DMM 
registered as a DMM in at least 500 Tape 
A issues would provide a further 
incentive for member organizations that 
are also a DMM to register as a DMM in 
a greater number of securities to earn 
the Non Display Tier 1 credits. The 
Exchange also believes that the 
requirement of registering as a DMM in 
at least 500 Tape A issues to qualify for 
the credit is not unfairly discriminatory 
because it would apply equally to all 
existing and prospective member 
organizations that are also a DMM that 
choose to register as a DMM in Tape A 
securities on the Exchange. The 
Exchange does not believe that it is 
unfairly discriminatory to offer 
incentives based on a prescribed 
threshold. The Exchange believes that 
the proposal would provide an equal 
incentive to any member organization 
that is also a DMM to register as a DMM 
in a greater number of Tape A issues, 
and that the proposal would not be 
unfairly discriminatory because the 
threshold-based incentive would be 
offered on equal terms to all similarly 
situated member organizations. 
Finally, the Exchange believes that it 
is subject to significant competitive 
forces, as described below in the 
Exchange’s statement regarding the 
burden on competition. 
For the foregoing reasons, the 
Exchange believes that the proposal is 
consistent with the Act. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
In accordance with Section 6(b)(8) of 
the Act,
14
the Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change would not impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. Instead, as 
discussed above, the Exchange believes 
that the proposed changes would 
encourage the submission of additional 
liquidity to a public exchange, thereby 
promoting market depth, price 
discovery and transparency and 
enhancing order execution 
opportunities for member organizations. 
As a result, the Exchange believes that 
the proposed change furthers the 
Commission’s goal in adopting 
Regulation NMS of fostering integrated 
competition among orders, which 
promotes ‘‘more efficient pricing of 
individual stocks for all types of orders, 
large and small.’’
15
 
Intramarket Competition. The 
proposed change is designed to attract 
additional order flow and new potential 
DMMs to the Exchange. The Exchange 
believes that the proposal to offer a 
financial incentive should incentivize 
member organizations that are also a 
DMM to register as a DMM in a greater 
number of Tape A issues. Greater 
participation on the Exchange would 
result in greater liquidity for the benefit 
of all market participants on the 
Exchange. The Non Display Tier 1 
credits would be available to all 
similarly-situated market participants, 
and, as such, the proposed changes 
would not impose a disparate burden on 
competition among market participants 
on the Exchange. 
Intermarket Competition. The 
Exchange operates in a highly 
competitive market in which market 
participants can readily choose to send 
their orders to other exchange and off- 
exchange venues if they deem fee levels 
at those other venues to be more 
favorable. In such an environment, the 
Exchange must continually adjust its 
fees and rebates to remain competitive 
with other exchanges and with off- 
exchange venues. Because competitors 
are free to modify their own fees and 
credits in response, and because market 
participants may readily adjust their 
order routing practices, the Exchange 
does not believe its proposed fee change 
can impose any burden on intermarket 
competition 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were solicited 
or received with respect to the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of 
the Act,
16
and Rule 19b–4(f)(2) 
thereunder
17
the Exchange has 
designated this proposal as establishing 
or changing a due, fee, or other charge 
imposed on any person, whether or not 
the person is a member of the self- 
regulatory organization, which renders 
the proposed rule change effective upon 
filing. At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments

I. Introduction 
On September 2, 2025, Banque 
Centrale de Compensation, which 
conducts business under the name LCH 
SA (‘‘LCH SA’’), filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’), pursuant to Section 
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 
thereunder,
2
a proposed rule change to 
amend the Terms of Reference of the 
Board of Directors of LCH SA (‘‘Board 
ToR’’) and the Terms of Reference of the 
Nomination Committee of the Board of 
Directors (‘‘Nomination Committee 
ToR’’) (together, the ‘‘Proposed Rule 
Change’’). The Proposed Rule Change 
was published for comment in the 
Federal Register on September 19, 
2025.
3
On November 3, 2025, the 
Commission designated a longer period 
within which to approve, disapprove, or 
institute proceedings to determine 
whether to approve or disapprove the 
Proposed Rule Change.
4
The 
Commission did not receive comments 
regarding the proposed rule change. For 
the reasons discussed below, the 
Commission is approving the proposed 
rule change. 
II. Description of the Proposed Rule 
Change 
LCH SA is a clearing agency 
registered with the Commission for the 
purpose of clearing security-based 
swaps. LCH SA is managed by a board 
of directors (the ‘‘Board’’). The Proposed 
Rule Change would modify the 
composition of the Board, as reflected in 
the Board ToR and Nomination 
Committee ToR. Specifically, the 
Proposed Rule Change would amend the 
provisions of both documents as they 
relate to directors that are nominated by 
(i) Euronext; (ii) Users of LCH SA; and 
(iii) the London Stock Exchange Group 
(‘‘LSEG’’).
5
The Proposed Rule Change 
also would make unrelated, minor 
updates to the Board ToR as it relates to 
the description of certain LCH SA 
personnel. 
A. Euronext Director 
LCH SA had a business relationship 
with Euronext pursuant to which LCH 
SA provided clearing services for 
certain trading facilities and markets 
operated by Euronext. LCH SA had 
agreements in place to document this 
relationship, and Euronext had an 
ownership stake in LCH SA. Recently, 
Euronext sold its ownership stake in 
LCH SA, and Euronext and LCH SA 
ended their clearing relationship.
6
Thus, 
LCH SA no longer offers clearing 
services to Euronext, and Euronext no 
longer has an ownership stake in LCH 
SA. 
Currently, Article 3 of the Board ToR 
gives Euronext the right to nominate one 
director while certain agreements 
between LCH SA and Euronext are in 
effect. Due to the end of the business 
relationship between LCH SA and 
Euronext, these agreements are no 
longer in place. Accordingly, the 
Proposed Rule Change would delete this 
provision from Article 3 and otherwise 
remove references to a director 
nominated by Euronext from the Board 
ToR, thus eliminating the Euronext 
director.
7
 
The Proposed Rule Change would 
make similar updates to the Nomination 
Committee ToR. The Proposed Rule 
Change would delete Article 2.1.5, 
which requires the Nomination 
Committee recommend to the Board for 
appointment a director nominated by 
Euronext. The Proposed Rule Change 
also would delete in its entirety Article 
4, which describes how Euronext may 
nominate a person to be a director and 
the criteria that a nominee must satisfy. 
B. User Directors 
The Board ToR currently defines a 
User Director as a director who is 
nominated by a shareholder of LCH 
Group which is a User or who is 
otherwise connected to such User 
shareholder by virtue of employment or 
directorship. A User is defined as an 
Eligible Institution other than an 
Exchange, and Eligible Institution 
means, among things, inter-dealer 
brokers, clearing members, and indirect 
users.
8
Thus, as currently written, a 
User must be a shareholder of LCH 
Group to nominate directors to the 
Board. 
The Proposed Rule Change would 
amend the Board ToR to allow all Users, 
not just those who are shareholders of 
LCH Group, to nominate directors to the 
Board. Thus, the Proposed Rule Change 
would amend the definition of User 
Director in the Board ToR to mean a 
director who is nominated by a User or 
who is otherwise connected to such 
User by virtue of their employment or 
directorship, regardless of whether the 
User is a shareholder of LCH Group. 
In the Nomination Committee ToR, 
the Proposed Rule Change would make 
a similar amendment and increase the 
number of User Directors. Article 2.1.3 
currently requires the Nomination 
Committee recommend to the Board for 
appointment up to two directors 
associated with or connected to ‘‘User 
Shareholders,’’ meaning Users that are 
shareholders of LCH Group. The 
Proposed Rule Change would amend 
Article 2.1.3 to increase the number to 
three from two, include any director 
associated with a User, and delete the 
term User Shareholder. Thus, under 
Article 2.1.3 as amended, the 
Nomination Committee would 
recommend to the Board for 
appointment up to three directors 
associated with a User. 
The Proposed Rule Change would 
make other changes to the Nomination 
Committee ToR to reflect that a User no 
longer needs to be a shareholder of LCH 
Group to nominate a director. The 
Appendix to the Nomination Committee 
ToR outlines the process for appointing 
and removing User Directors to the 
Board. In the Appendix, the Proposed 
Rule Change would delete references to 
User Shareholders and any other 
references to a User being a shareholder 
of LCH Group.
9
 
The Proposed Rule Change also 
would update the Appendix as it relates 
to the criteria applicable to a User 
Director. Specifically, Section 2(b) of the 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:40 Dec 16, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00116 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\17DEN1.SGM 17DEN1

Eligible User is defined in the Appendix as a 
User who is not connected with an existing director 
and who has not served notice termination its 
clearing relationship with LCH SA or LCH Ltd. 
11
As noted above, the term Eligible Institution is 
defined in the Articles of Association of LCH Group 
and means, among things, inter-dealer brokers, 
clearing members, and indirect users. See Notice, 90 FR at 45289, n.10.

Appendix currently requires the 
Nomination Committee to recommend a 
replacement for any User Director who 
is removed due to the User who 
nominated them ceasing to be an 
Eligible User.
10
The Proposed Rule 
Change would simplify this 
requirement. Under the Proposed Rule 
Change, the Nomination Committee 
would recommend a replacement for 
any User Director who is removed due 
to the User who nominated them 
ceasing to be an Eligible Institution.
11
 
LCH SA is making this change to 
reflect the current number of Users that 
are shareholders of LCH Group. Due to 
an increase in London Stock Exchange 
Group’s ownership interest in LCH 
Group, only eleven financial firms 
remain as shareholders of LCH Group.
12
 
Of these remaining shareholders, five 
have not previously indicated a desire 
to nominate a User Director.
13
Thus, the 
pool of firms which are both 
shareholders of LCH Group and Users 
have decreased. To help ensure that a 
sufficient number of firms that are Users 
are interested in nominating directors to 
the Board, LCH SA is removing the 
requirement that a User Director be 
nominated by a User who is also a 
shareholder of LCH Group. 
Finally, LCH SA is increasing the 
number of User Directors by one to 
maintain its current number of directors 
following the removal of the director 
previously nominated by Euronext. 
C. LSEG Director 
Currently LSEG has the right to 
nominate one director to the Board. The 
Proposed Rule Change would increase 
the number of directors nominated by 
LSEG to three. The Proposed Rule 
Change would amend Article 2.1.4 of 
the Nomination Committee ToR to 
reflect the increase to three. 
The two additional directors 
nominated by LSEG would take the 
place of the LCH Group CEO and LSEG 
Chief Risk Officer (‘‘CRO’’). Article 2.3 
of the Nomination Committee ToR 
currently states that the Board will 
include, as directors, the LCH SA CEO, 
LCH Group CEO, and the LSEG CRO. 
The Proposed Rule Change would 
amend Article 2.3 to remove references 
to the LCH Group CEO and the LSEG 
CRO. 
Elsewhere in the Nomination 
Committee ToR, the Proposed Rule 
Change would update references to 
LSEG directors to clarify that the 
directors nominated by LSEG will now 
be three rather than one. The Proposed 
Rule Change also would add a reference 
to LSEG directors in Article 7. As 
amended, Article 7 would provide that 
LSEG directors, as well as the LCH SA 
CEO, are not subject to term limits for 
service on the Board. 
LCH SA is making this change for two 
reasons. First, the LCH Group CEO has 
stepped down as a member of the Board 
of LCH SA.
14
To replace that individual 
as director on the Board, LCH SA is 
proposing to grant LSEG the ability to 
nominate an additional director. 
Second, revising Article 2.3 to remove 
specific references to the LSEG CRO 
simplifies the appointment of the LSEG 
directors by not limiting those directors 
to persons serving a specific role at 
LSEG. Thus, under the proposed rule 
change, LSEG could still appoint its 
CRO to serve on the LCH SA board, but 
LSEG would not be required to do so. 
D. Other Changes 
The proposed rule change also would 
revise certain articles of the Board ToR 
to clarify that certain personnel, such as 
the LCH SA CEO, may be male or 
female. 
III. Discussion and Commission 
Findings 
Section 19(b)(2)(C) of the Act directs 
the Commission to approve a proposed 
rule change of a self-regulatory 
organization if it finds that the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
requirements of the Act and the rules 
and regulations thereunder applicable to 
such organization.
15
Under the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice, the 
‘‘burden to demonstrate that a proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
Exchange Act and the rules and 
regulations issued thereunder . . . is on 
the self-regulatory organization [‘SRO’] 
that proposed the rule change.’’
16
 
The description of a proposed rule 
change, its purpose and operation, its 
effect, and a legal analysis of its 
consistency with applicable 
requirements must all be sufficiently 
detailed and specific to support an 
affirmative Commission finding,
17
and 
any failure of an SRO to provide this 
information may result in the 
Commission not having a sufficient 
basis to make an affirmative finding that 
a proposed rule change is consistent 
with the Exchange Act and the 
applicable rules and regulations.
18
 
Moreover, ‘‘unquestioning reliance’’ on 
an SRO’s representations in a proposed 
rule change is not sufficient to justify 
Commission approval of a proposed rule 
change.
19
 
After carefully considering the 
Proposed Rule Change, the Commission 
finds that the Proposed Rule Change is 
consistent with the requirements of the 
Act and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to LCH SA. More 
specifically, for the reasons given below, 
the Commission finds that the Proposed 
Rule Change is consistent with Section 
17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act
20
and Rule 
17ad–22(e)(2)(i).
21
 
A. Section 17A(b)(3)(C) 
Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act 
requires, among other things, that the 
rules of LCH SA assure a fair 
representation of its shareholders (or 
members) and participants in the 
selection of its directors and 
administration of its affairs.
22
As noted 
above, the Proposed Rule Change would 
increase the number of directors 
nominated by Users from two to three 
and would remove the requirement that 
a User be a shareholder of LCH Group 
to nominate a director. Users could 
include among others, inter-dealer 
brokers, clearing members, and indirect 
users. By removing the requirement that 
a User be a shareholder of LCH Group, 
the Proposed Rule Change would 
expand the pool of Users that could 
nominate directors to the Board. This 
change, and increasing the number of 
User directors, would help assure a fair 
representation of LCH SA’s participants 
in the selection of its directors, 
consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of 
the Act.
23
 
Moreover, the Proposed Rule Change 
would increase the number of directors 
nominated by LSEG. As noted above, 
LSEG is an indirect shareholder of LCH 
SA. By increasing the number of 
directors that LSEG can select, the 
Proposed Rule Change would help 
assure a fair representation of LCH SA’s 
shareholders in the selection of its 
directors, consistent with Section 
17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act.

In approving the proposed rule change, the 
Commission considered the proposal’s impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 15

Accordingly, the Commission finds 
that the Proposed Rule Change is 
consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of 
the Act.
25
 
B. Rule 17ad–22(e)(2)(i) 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(2)(i) requires that a 
covered clearing agency, such as LCH 
SA, establish, implement, maintain, and 
enforce written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to provide for 
governance arrangements that, among 
other things, are clear and transparent.
26
 
As noted above, the Proposed Rule 
Change would eliminate the Euronext 
director because of changes in the 
business relationship between Euronext 
and LCH SA. Articles of the Board ToR 
and Nomination Committee ToR that 
give Euronext the right to nominate a 
director are no longer relevant or 
applicable. Deleting these provisions 
and references to the Euronext director 
thus removes outdated and inapplicable 
provisions, thereby reducing confusion 
and increasing clarity. 
Moreover, the Proposed Rule Change 
would remove the requirement that a 
User be a shareholder of LCH Group to 
nominate a director. This change would 
clarify the governance arrangements of 
the Board by simplifying the conditions 
applicable to the selection of directors 
by Users. Going forward, the 
Nomination Committee will no longer 
need to consider if a User submitting a 
nominee is also a shareholder of LCH 
Group. 
The proposed changes to directors 
nominated by LSEG would also simplify 
and clarify the governance arrangements 
for selecting these directors. As noted 
above, the Proposed Rule Change would 
replace a requirement that the LCH 
Group CEO and the LSEG CRO be 
directors with a more general 
requirement that LSEG appoint three 
directors (including the one director 
LSEG already appoints). The Proposed 
Rule Change also would update 
references, as needed, to account for 
LSEG nominating additional directors. 
Again, these changes would make LCH 
SA’s governance arrangements clearer 
by replacing a specific requirement with 
one that is more general and easier to 
apply. 
Finally, LCH SA’s proposed changes 
also include amendments to reflect that 
certain personnel, such as the LCH SA 
CEO, may be male or female, which 
clarifies the previous iteration of these 
provisions. 
Accordingly, the Commission finds 
that the Proposed Rule Change is 
consistent with the requirements of Rule 
17ad–22(e)(2)(i).
27
 
IV. Conclusion 
On the basis of the foregoing, the 
Commission finds that the Proposed 
Rule Change is consistent with the 
requirements of the Act, and in 
particular, with the requirements of 
Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act
28
and 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(2)(i).
29
 
It is therefore ordered pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2) of the Act
30
that the 
proposed rule change (SR–LCH SA– 
2025–008) be, and hereby is, 
approved.

forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
Fee Schedule applicable to its equities 
trading platform (‘‘BYX Equities’’) by: (i) 
revising the volume component of Add/ 
Remove Volume Tiers 1–2; (ii) removing 
the shares component of Add/Remove 
Volume Tiers 1–2 and replacing it with 
a component that excludes a Member’s 
subdollar trading activity; (iii) adding a 
criteria that excludes a Member’s 
subdollar trading activity to Add/ 
Remove Volume Tiers 3–5; (iv) 
removing the shares component of the 
Non-Displayed Tier and replacing it 
with a TCV component; (v) and adding 
a criteria that excludes a Member’s 
subdollar trading activity to the Non- 
Displayed Tier; and (vi) removing the 
Routing Tier. The Exchange proposes to 
implement these changes effective 
December 1, 2025. 
The Exchange first notes that it 
operates in a highly competitive market 
in which market participants can 
readily direct order flow to competing 
venues if they deem fee levels at a 
particular venue to be excessive or 
incentives to be insufficient. More 
specifically, the Exchange is only one of 
17 registered equities exchanges, as well 
as a number of alternative trading 
systems and other off-exchange venues 
that do not have similar self-regulatory 
responsibilities under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (the ‘‘Act’’), to 
which market participants may direct 
their order flow. Based on publicly 
available information,
3
no single 
registered equities exchange has more 
than 15% of the market share. Thus, in 
such a low-concentrated and highly 
competitive market, no single equities 
exchange possesses significant pricing 
power in the execution of order flow. 
The Exchange in particular operates a 
‘‘Taker-Maker’’ model whereby it pays 
credits to members that remove 
liquidity and assesses fees to those that 
add liquidity. The Exchange’s Fee 
Schedule sets forth the standard rebates 
and rates applied per share for orders 
that remove and provide liquidity, 
respectively. Currently, for orders in 
securities priced at or above $1.00, the 
Exchange provides a standard rebate of 
$0.00200 per share for orders that 
remove liquidity and assesses a fee of 
$0.00200 per share for orders that add 
liquidity.
4
For orders in securities 
priced below $1.00, the Exchange does 
not assess any fees for orders that add 
liquidity, and provides a rebate in the 
amount of 0.10% of the total dollar 
value for orders that remove liquidity.
5
 
Additionally, in response to the 
competitive environment, the Exchange 
also offers tiered pricing which provides 
Members opportunities to qualify for 
higher rebates or reduced fees where 
certain volume criteria and thresholds 
are met. Tiered pricing provides an 
incremental incentive for Members to 
strive for higher tier levels, which 
provides increasingly higher benefits or 
discounts for satisfying increasingly 
more stringent criteria. 
Add/Remove Volume Tiers and Non- 
Displayed Tier 
Under footnote 1 of the Fee Schedule, 
the Exchange currently offers various 
Add/Remove Volume Tiers. In 
particular, the Exchange offers five Add/ 
Remove Volume Tiers that each provide 
a reduced fee for Members’ qualifying 
orders yielding fee codes B,
6
V,
7
Y,
8
and 
AD
9
where a Member reaches certain 
volume-based criteria. First, the 
Exchange proposes to (i) revise the 
volume component of Add/Remove 
Volume Tiers 1–2 and (ii) remove the 
shares component of Add/Remove 
Volume Tiers 1–2 and replace it with a 
component that excludes a Member’s 
subdollar trading activity. The criteria 
for current Add/Remove Volume Tiers 
1–2 is as follows: 
€Add/Remove Volume Tier 1 assesses a reduced fee of $0.0016 per 
share in securities priced at or above 
$1.00 to qualifying orders (i.e., orders yielding fee codes B, V, Y, or AD) where 
(1) Member has a combined Auction 
ADV
10
and ADAV
11
 0.10% of the TCV
12
or (2) Member has a combined 
Auction ADV and ADAV  11,000,000 shares. 
€Add/Remove Volume Tier 2 assesses a reduced fee of $0.0014 per 
share in securities priced at or above 
$1.00 to qualifying orders (i.e., orders yielding fee codes B, V, Y, or AD) where 
(1) Member has a combined Auction 
ADV and ADAV  0.15% of the TCV or (2) Member has a combined Auction 
ADV and ADAV  16,000,000 shares. The proposed criteria for current 
Add/Remove Volume Tiers 1–2 is as 
follows: 
€Proposed Add/Remove Volume Tier 1 assesses a reduced fee of $0.0016 per 
share in securities priced at or above 
$1.00 to qualifying orders (i.e., orders yielding fee codes B, V, Y, or AD) where 
(1) Member has a combined Auction 
ADV and ADAV  0.075% of the TCV or (2) Member has a combined Ex- 
Subdollar Auction ADV

and Ex- 
Subdollar ADAV

as a percentage of 
Ex-Subdollar TCV  0.075%.15
 
€Proposed Add/Remove Volume Tier 1 assesses a reduced fee of $0.0016 per 
share in securities priced at or above

ADV and ADAV  0.10% of the TCV or (2) Member has a combined Ex- 
Subdollar Auction ADV and Ex- 
Subdollar ADAV as a percentage of Ex- 
Subdollar TCV  0.10%. In addition, the Exchange proposes to 
introduce a second criteria that excludes 
a Member’s subdollar trading activity to 
Add/Remove Volume Tiers 3–5. The 
criteria for current Add/Remove Volume 
Tiers 3–5 is as follows:

for certain tiers in order to determine the 
appropriate fees and rebates for its Members. See

$1.00 to qualifying orders (i.e., orders yielding fee codes B, V, Y, or AD) where 
Member has a combined Auction ADV 
and ADAV  0.30% of the TCV. €Add/Remove Volume Tier 4 assesses a reduced fee of $0.0012 per 
share in securities priced at or above 
$1.00 to qualifying orders (i.e., orders yielding fee codes B, V, Y, or AD) where 
Member has a combined Auction ADV 
and ADAV  0.60% of the TCV. €Add/Remove Volume Tier 5 assesses a reduced fee of $0.0012 per

$1.00 to qualifying orders (i.e., orders yielding fee codes B, V, Y, or AD) where 
MPID has a combined Auction ADV and 
ADAV  0.55% of the TCV. The proposed criteria for Add/ 
Remove Volume Tiers 3–5 is as follows: 
€Proposed Add/Remove Volume Tier 3 assesses a reduced fee of $0.0013 per 
share in securities priced at or above 
$1.00 to qualifying orders (i.e., orders yielding fee codes B, V, Y, or AD) where 
(1) Member has a combined Auction 
ADV and ADAV  0.30% of the TCV or (2) Member has a combined Ex- 
Subdollar Auction ADV and Ex- 
Subdollar ADAV as a percentage of Ex- 
Subdollar TCV  0.30%. €Proposed Add/Remove Volume Tier 4 assesses a reduced fee of $0.0012 per 
share in securities priced at or above 
$1.00 to qualifying orders (i.e., orders yielding fee codes B, V, Y, or AD) where 
Member has a combined Auction ADV 
and ADAV  0.60% of the TCV or (2) Member has a combined Ex-Subdollar 
Auction ADV and Ex-Subdollar ADAV 
as a percentage of Ex-Subdollar TCV  
0.60%. 
€Proposed Add/Remove Volume Tier 5 assesses a reduced fee of $0.0012 per 
share in securities priced at or above 
$1.00 to qualifying orders (i.e., orders yielding fee codes B, V, Y, or AD) where 
MPID has a combined Auction ADV and 
ADAV  0.55% of the TCV or (2) MPID has a combined Ex-Subdollar Auction 
ADV and Ex-Subdollar ADAV as a 
percentage of Ex-Subdollar TCV  
0.55%. 
Additionally, under footnote 1 of the 
Fee Schedule, the Exchange offers a 
Non-Displayed Tier that provides a 
reduced fee for Members’ qualifying 
orders yielding fee codes AH
16
and 
MM
17
where a Member reaches certain 
volume-based criteria. First, the 
Exchange proposes to remove the shares 
component of the Non-Displayed Tier 
and replace it with a TCV component. 
In addition, the Exchange proposes to 
add a second prong of criteria that 
excludes a Member’s subdollar trading 
activity to the Non-Displayed Tier. The 
criteria for the current Non-Displayed 
Tier is as follows: 
€The Non-Displayed Tier assesses a reduced fee of $0.0005 per share in 
securities priced at or above $1.00 to 
qualifying orders (i.e., orders yielding fee codes B, V, Y, or AD) where Member 
has a combined Auction ADV and 
ADAV  5,000,000. The proposed criteria for the Non- 
Displayed Tier is as follows: 
€The proposed Non-Displayed Tier assesses a reduced fee of $0.0005 per 
share in securities priced at or above 
$1.00 to qualifying orders (i.e., orders yielding fee codes B, V, Y, or AD) where 
(1) Member has a combined Auction 
ADV and ADAV  0.03% of the TCV or (2) Member has a combined Ex- 
Subdollar Auction ADV and Ex- 
Subdollar ADAV as a percentage of Ex- 
Subdollar TCV  0.03%. The proposed modification to the 
volume component of the first prong of 
criteria of Add/Remove Volume Tiers 1– 
2 represents a modest decrease in 
difficulty of one prong of criteria to 
achieve the applicable tier threshold 
while maintaining the existing fee. 
Additionally, the proposed modification 
to the volume component of the first 
prong of criteria of the Non-Displayed 
Tier seeks to align the criteria of the 
Non-Displayed Tier with the first prong 
of criteria applicable to the Add/ 
Remove Volume Tiers while 
maintaining the existing fee. In each 
instance, the revised first prong of 
criteria is designed to match the 
percentage requirement in the proposed 
second prong of criteria and is 
commensurate with the reduced fee 
assessed if the criteria is satisfied. 
While Auction ADV or ADAV as a 
percentage of TCV is generally a 
reasonable baseline for determining 
tiered pricing for Members, the 
Exchange notes that in certain months 
where subdollar trading volume is 
significantly higher, TCV becomes 
inflated due to the higher levels of 
subdollar volume. During these months 
of high subdollar trading volume, if a 
Member does not increase its volume to 
account for the increased TCV, then the 
Member is disadvantaged when it comes 
to satisfying criteria requiring Auction 
ADV or ADAV as a percentage of TCV. 
The Exchange’s proposed introduction 
of the Ex-Subdollar ADV and ADAV as 
a percentage of Ex-Subdollar TCV prong 
of criteria (the ‘‘Ex-Subdollar Criteria’’) 
in Add Volume Tiers 1–3 and Add 
Volume Tiers 5–7 is designed to provide 
Members with an opportunity to earn an 
enhanced rebate during months when 
subdollar trading activity is high and 
the Exchange’s calculation of ADAV 
inclusive of subdollar volume under the 
Tiers’ existing criteria could potentially 
make it far more difficult for the 
Member to qualify, particularly when 
the Member’s volume in securities 
priced at or above $1.00 remains 
relatively constant. The Exchange notes 
that its proposed Ex-Subdollar Criteria 
in Add Volume Tiers 1–3 and Add 
Volume Tiers 5–7 will introduce a new 
method of calculating ADAV as a 
percentage of TCV, exclusive of 
subdollar activity.
18
 
This change is intended to aid 
Members during months where 
subdollar volume is elevated, thus 
causing the TCV (used as the 
denominator when the Exchange 
calculates this prong of criteria) to be 
significantly higher while the Member’s 
ADAV (used as the numerator for the 
Exchange’s calculation of this prong of 
criteria) remains relatively stable if they 
are not actively trading in securities 
priced below $1.00. In months when 
subdollar trading activity is particularly 
high, the Exchange believes that it 
would be unfair to Members that 
execute significant volume in securities 
priced at or above $1.00 to potentially 
not be able to qualify for an enhanced 
rebate or lose existing incentives due to 
an increase in TCV due to a significant 
increase in the amount of volume in 
securities priced below $1.00. The 
Exchange believes that the proposed 
criteria continues to be commensurate 
with the rebate received for each tier 
and will encourage Members to grow 
their volume on the Exchange. Increased 
volume on the Exchange contributes to 
a deeper and more liquid market, which 
benefits all market participants and 
provides greater execution opportunities 
on the Exchange. 
Routing Tier 
Under footnote 3 of the Fee Schedule, 
the Exchange currently offers a Routing

where certain volume-

proposes to delete the Routing Tier as 
the Exchange does not wish to, nor is 
required to, maintain such tier. More 
specifically, the proposed change 
removes this tier as the Exchange would 
rather redirect future resources and 
funding into other programs and tiers 
intended to incentivize increased order 
flow. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the Act 
and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
20
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5)
21
requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged 
in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, 
and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
22
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers as 
well as Section 6(b)(4)
23
as it is 
designed to provide for the equitable 
allocation of reasonable dues, fees and 
other charges among its Members and 
other persons using its facilities. 
As described above, the Exchange 
operates in a highly competitive market 
in which market participants can 
readily direct order flow to competing 
venues if they deem fee levels at a 
particular venue to be excessive or 
incentives to be insufficient. The 
Exchange believes that its proposed 
changes to the Add/Volume Tiers and 
Non-Displayed Tier reflects a 
competitive pricing structure designed 
to incentivize market participants to 
direct their order flow to the Exchange, 
which the Exchange believes would 
enhance market quality to the benefit of 
all Members. Additionally, the 
Exchange notes that relative volume- 
based incentives and discounts have 
been widely adopted by exchanges,
24
 
including the Exchange,
25
and are 
reasonable, equitable and non- 
discriminatory because they are open to 
all Members on an equal basis and 
provide additional benefits or discounts 
that are reasonably related to (i) the 
value to an exchange’s market quality 
and (ii) associated higher levels of 
market activity, such as higher levels of 
liquidity provision and/or growth 
patterns. Competing equity exchanges 
offer similar tiered pricing structures, 
including schedules or rebates and fees 
that apply based upon members 
achieving certain volume and/or growth 
thresholds, as well as assess similar fees 
or rebates for similar types of orders, to 
that of the Exchange. 
In particular, the Exchange believes 
its proposal to modify the Add/Remove 
Volume Tiers and Non-Displayed Tier is 
reasonable because the tiers will be 
available to all Members and provide all 
Members with an opportunity to receive 
a reduced fee should certain criteria be 
met. The Exchange further believes that 
the revised Add/Remove Volume Tiers 
and the revised Non-Displayed Tier will 
provide a reasonable means to 
encourage adding displayed and non- 
displayed orders in Members’ order 
flow to the Exchange and to incentivize 
Members to continue to provide volume 
to the Exchange by offering them an 
additional opportunity to receive a 
reduced fee on qualifying orders. An 
overall increase in activity would 
deepen the Exchange’s liquidity pool, 
offer additional cost savings, support 
the quality of price discovery, promote 
market transparency and improve 
market quality, for all investors. 
The Exchange believes proposed 
modified Add/Remove Volume Tiers 
and modified Non-Displayed Tier are 
reasonable as they do not represent a 
significant departure from the criteria 
currently offered in the Fee Schedule. 
The Exchange also believes that the 
proposal represents an equitable 
allocation of fees and rebates and is not 
unfairly discriminatory because all 
Members will be eligible for the revised 
tiers and have the opportunity to meet 
the tiers’ criteria and receive the 
corresponding reduced fee if such 
criteria are met. Without having a view 
of activity on other markets and off- 
exchange venues, the Exchange has no 
way of knowing whether these proposed 
rule changes would definitely result in 
any Members qualifying for the new 
proposed tiers. While the Exchange has 
no way of predicting with certainty how 
the proposed changes will impact 
Member activity, based on the prior 
months volume, the Exchange 
anticipates that at least three Members 
will be able to satisfy proposed Add/ 
Remove Volume Tier 1, no Members 
will be able to satisfy proposed Add/ 
Remove Volume Tier 2, no Members 
will be able to satisfy proposed Add/ 
Remove Volume Tier 3, no Members 
will be able to satisfy proposed Add/ 
Remove Volume Tier 4, no Members 
will be able to satisfy proposed Add/ 
Remove Volume Tier 5, and at least nine 
Members will be able to satisfy the 
proposed Non-Displayed Tier. The 
Exchange also notes that the proposed 
changes will not adversely impact any 
Member’s ability to qualify for reduced 
fees or enhanced rebates offered under 
other tiers. Should a Member not meet 
the proposed new criteria, the Member 
will merely not receive that 
corresponding reduced fee. 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal to eliminate the Routing Tier is 
reasonable because the Exchange is not 
required to maintain this tier nor is it 
required to provide Members an 
opportunity to receive enhanced 
rebates. The Exchange believes its 
proposal to eliminate this tier is also 
equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory because it applies to all 
Members (i.e., the tier will not be available for any Member). The 
Exchange also notes that the proposed 
rule change to remove this tier merely 
results in Members not receiving an 
enhanced rebate, which, as noted above, 
the Exchange is not required to offer or 
maintain. Furthermore, the proposed 
rule change to eliminate the tier enables 
the Exchange to redirect resources and 
funding into other programs and tiers 
intended to incentivize increased order 
flow. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. Rather, as 
discussed above, the Exchange believes 
that the proposed change would 
encourage the submission of additional 
order flow to a public exchange, thereby 
promoting market depth, execution 
incentives and enhanced execution 
opportunities, as well as price discovery 
and transparency for all Members. As a 
result, the Exchange believes that the

No. 59039 (December 2, 2008), 73 FR 74770, 74782– 
83 (December 9, 2008) (SR–NYSEArca–2006–21)).

proposed changes further the 
Commission’s goal in adopting 
Regulation NMS of fostering 
competition among orders, which 
promotes ‘‘more efficient pricing of 
individual stocks for all types of orders, 
large and small.’’ 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule changes do not impose any burden 
on intramarket competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. Particularly, 
the proposed modified Add/Remove 
Volume Tiers and modified Non- 
Displayed Tier will apply to all 
Members equally in that all Members 
are eligible for the tiers and reduced 
fees, have a reasonable opportunity to 
meet the proposed tiers’ criteria and 
will receive the reduced fee on their 
qualifying orders if such criteria is met. 
The Exchange does not believe the 
proposed changes burden competition, 
but rather, enhance competition as they 
are intended to increase the 
competitiveness of BYX by amending 
existing pricing incentives in order to 
attract order flow and incentivize 
participants to increase their 
participation on the Exchange, 
providing for additional execution 
opportunities for market participants 
and improved price transparency. 
Greater overall order flow, trading 
opportunities, and pricing transparency 
benefits all market participants on the 
Exchange by enhancing market quality 
and continuing to encourage Members 
to send orders, thereby contributing 
towards a robust and well-balanced 
market ecosystem. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes 
the proposed elimination of the current 
Routing Tier does not impose any 
burden on intramarket competition that 
is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
Specifically, the proposed change to 
eliminate the current Routing Tier will 
not impose any burden on intramarket 
competition because the changes apply 
to all Members uniformly, as in, the tier 
will no longer be available to any 
Member. 
Next, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule changes does not impose 
any burden on intermarket competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
As previously discussed, the Exchange 
operates in a highly competitive market. 
Members have numerous alternative 
venues that they may participate on and 
direct their order flow, including other 
equities exchanges, off-exchange 
venues, and alternative trading systems. 
Additionally, the Exchange represents a 
small percentage of the overall market. 
Based on publicly available information, 
no single equities exchange has more 
than 15% of the market share.
26
 
Therefore, no exchange possesses 
significant pricing power in the 
execution of order flow. Indeed, 
participants can readily choose to send 
their orders to other exchange and off- 
exchange venues if they deem fee levels 
at those other venues to be more 
favorable. Moreover, the Commission 
has repeatedly expressed its preference 
for competition over regulatory 
intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities 
markets. Specifically, in Regulation 
NMS, the Commission highlighted the 
importance of market forces in 
determining prices and SRO revenues 
and, also, recognized that current 
regulation of the market system ‘‘has 
been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
27
The 
fact that this market is competitive has 
also long been recognized by the courts. 
In NetCoalition v. Securities and 
Exchange Commission, the D.C. Circuit 
stated as follows: ‘‘[n]o one disputes 
that competition for order flow is 
‘fierce.’ . . . As the SEC explained, ‘[i]n 
the U.S. national market system, buyers 
and sellers of securities, and the broker- 
dealers that act as their order-routing 
agents, have a wide range of choices of 
where to route orders for execution’; 
[and] ‘no exchange can afford to take its 
market share percentages for granted’ 
because ‘no exchange possesses a 
monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in 
the execution of order flow from broker 
dealers’. . . .’’.
28
Accordingly, the 
Exchange does not believe its proposed 
fee change imposes any burden on 
competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received from 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received comments on the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) 
of the Act
29
and paragraph (f) of Rule 
19b–4
30
thereunder. At any time within 
60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved.

Approval of Proposed Rule Change, as 
Modified by Partial Amendment No. 1,

Concerning Adjustments to Cleared 
Contracts 
December 12, 2025. 
I. Introduction 
On September 26, 2025, the Options 
Clearing Corporation (‘‘OCC’’) filed with 
the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (‘‘Commission’’) the 
proposed rule change SR–OCC–2025– 
017, pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Exchange Act’’)
1
and Rule 19b–4
2
 
thereunder, to revise and reorganize its 
rules pertaining to options contract 
adjustments.
3
The proposed rule change 
was published for public comment in 
the Federal Register on October 1, 2025.
4
On November 3, 2025, pursuant 
to Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act,
5
 
the Commission designated a longer 
period within which to approve, 
disapprove, or institute proceedings to 
determine whether to approve or 
disapprove the proposed rule change, 
until December 30, 2025.
6
On December 
5, 2025, OCC partially amended SR– 
OCC–2025–017 to (1) correct proposed 
rule text describing the current 
composition and governance of OCC’s 
Securities Committee, as approved by 
the Commission in a prior proposed rule 
change;
7
and (2) conform cross 
references found elsewhere in OCC’s 
rules to the restatement of the contract 
adjustment rules proposed in the Notice 
of Filing (‘‘Partial Amendment No. 1’’).
8
 
The Commission has received no 
comments regarding the proposed rule 
change. The Commission is publishing 
this notice to solicit comments on 
Partial Amendment No. 1 from 
interested persons, and, for the reasons 
discussed below, is approving the 
proposed rule change as modified by 
Partial Amendment No. 1 (hereinafter 
defined as the ‘‘Proposed Rule 
Change’’). 
II. Background 
OCC is a central counterparty 
(‘‘CCP’’), which means that, as part of its 
function as a clearing agency, it 
interposes itself as the buyer to every 
seller and the seller to every buyer for 
certain financial transactions. As the 
CCP for the listed options markets in the 
United States,
9
as well as for certain 
futures and stock loans, OCC has certain 
processing obligations during the life of 
the products it clears. For example, it 
may be necessary for OCC to adjust the 
terms of a contract it has cleared. A 
contract adjustment refers to the 
modification of terms of an overlying 
derivative, like the options that are 
cleared and settled by OCC, in response 
to certain corporate actions that affect 
an underlying security—such as 
declaration of dividends or 
distributions, stock splits, rights 
offerings, reorganizations, or the merger 
or liquidation of an issuer.
10
OCC states 
that it makes adjustments to maintain 
the economic value of existing positions 
by mirroring what occurs to the 
underlying security using determinative 
factors on a case-by-case basis.
11
 
Currently, OCC has broad authority to 
effect contract adjustments and, 
typically, makes a determination based 
on (a) fairness to holders and writers (or 
purchasers and sellers) of the affected 
contracts; (b) the maintenance of a fair 
and orderly market in the affected 
contracts; (c) consistency of 
interpretation and practice; (d) 
efficiency of exercise settlement 
procedures; and (e) the coordination 
with other clearing agencies of the 
clearance and settlement of transactions 
in the underlying interest.
12
 
As part of its contract adjustment risk 
management, OCC proposes to (1) adopt 
rules reflecting OCC’s current practices 
in making adjustment determinations; 
and (2) relocate, consolidate, and update 
references to adjustment-related 
provisions within its By-Laws and 
Rules.
13
Regarding substantive 
revisions, OCC proposes to codify 
within its Rules the current practices 
related to adjustment determinations 
(e.g., by specifying additional circumstances when OCC will generally 
not make an adjustment or specifying 
additional factors guiding adjustment 
determinations).
14
As to the non- 
substantive reorganization of 
adjustment-related provisions, OCC 
proposes to (i) relocate OCC’s existing 
provisions from its By-Laws to the new 
Chapter XXVIII of the Rules, which 
would encompass Rules 2801 through 
2805;
15
(ii) consolidate provisions 
regarding OCC’s adjustment authority 
and practices for actively traded 
products with similar methods of 
adjustments
16
to eliminate duplicative 
provisions (e.g., consolidating provisions for adjustments to stock 
futures and stock options); and (iii) 
update references to current adjustment 
By-Laws sections contained in other 
adjustment provisions of the By-Laws 
for products not actively traded, and 
with regard to governance provisions for 
amendments to Rules and By-Laws. The

See Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47481. To illustrate such longstanding practices, OCC points 
to past guidance that has been publicly released in 
the form of Information Memos. See generally 
Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47481–47483.

See Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47473. 21
Generally, OCC will not make an adjustment to 
an options or futures contract with respect to 
ordinary dividends or distributions that are 
routinely made by the issuer because ordinary 
dividends or distributions may be factored into the 
economic expectations of the parties to an options 
or futures contract even though the event has not 
yet been formally announced or declared. See Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47471.

25
See Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47481–82. For example, OCC states that ‘‘[i]n certain 
circumstances, the terms of a corporate action on 
an underlying security of an option may result in 
a fractional entitlement per 100 shares of stock for 
which cash will be paid in lieu of the fractional 
shares. In such situations, a contract adjustment 
that is effective on the option in response to the 
corporate action on the underlying security may 
result in an adjusted option deliverable that 
includes a cash component in lieu of fractional 
shares.’’ Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47481. 
26
See Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47482. 27
Id. 
proposed changes are described in more 
detail below. 
A. Codification of Current Practices 
OCC represents that the proposed 
provisions concerning its adjustment 
process result from and reflect 
longstanding practices that OCC 
developed under its existing adjustment 
authority but that have not been 
codified as rules.
17
OCC maintains that 
this codification is meant to provide 
more detail, transparency, and clarity 
around its adjustment process.
18
The 
provisions codifying OCC’s current 
adjustment practices would be written 
into Chapter XXVIII of the Rules and are 
discussed at greater length below. 
1. Applicability to Specific Types of 
Contracts 
Rule 2802(a)(1) would add a list of the 
types of cleared instruments for which 
OCC’s Securities Committee may adopt 
statements of policy or interpretations 
regarding adjustments. The types of 
cleared instruments would be stock 
option contracts, Treasury securities 
option contracts, yield-based Treasury 
option contracts, debt securities option 
contracts, index option contracts, or 
other cash-settled option contracts. OCC 
states that listing the types of 
instruments would provide increased 
specificity.
19
 
2. Clarification of the Securities 
Committee’s Authority 
Rule 2802(a)(2) would leave intact the 
composition and governance of the 
Securities Committee, but would update 
the description of its authority. The 
proposed language of Rule 2802(a)(2) 
would reflect almost all of the current 
text of Section 11(c) of Article VI of the 
By-Laws. However, the Proposed Rule 
Change would modify the applicable 
title from ‘‘Adjustment Policies and 
Procedures,’’ as is written in Section 11 
of Article VI of the By-Laws, to 
‘‘Statements of Adjustment Policies and 
Interpretations,’’ which would be the 
title for Rule 2802. Additionally, Rule 
2802(a)(2) would delete text that 
describes the Securities Committee’s 
authority as being able to ‘‘make certain 
determinations with respect to cleared 
contracts’’ and replace this language 
with ‘‘adopt statements of policy or 
interpretations’’ related to contract 
adjustments. OCC states that the 
proposed changes would more 
accurately describe the Securities 
Committee’s authority and clarify that 
the Securities Committee’s function is to 
issue such statements.
20
 
3. Events Not Ordinarily Resulting in 
Contract Adjustment 
OCC currently specifies the types of 
events not ordinarily resulting in a 
contract adjustment under Section 11A 
of Article VI of the By-Laws and would 
continue to do so under proposed Rule 
2803(c). However, OCC proposes new 
subprovisions describing additional 
situations that would not result in 
contract adjustments regardless of the 
manner of payment. Rule 
2803(c)(1)(iii)(B) would specify that a 
stock dividend or distribution by the 
issuer of the underlying security that is 
paid in lieu of a cash dividend or 
distribution that itself would have been 
an ordinary distribution would be 
considered an ‘‘ordinary’’ dividend or 
distribution and, therefore, would not 
ordinarily result in a contract 
adjustment.
21
Similarly, Rule 
2803(c)(3)(v) would state that 
adjustments generally will not be made 
where a dividend or distribution is 
determined to be ordinary regardless of 
whether it is subject to a shareholder 
election regarding the form in which it 
will be paid, such as cash or stock. OCC 
asserts that these codifications are 
consistent with current rules as to what 
types of events are eligible for 
adjustment and that, generally, the 
determination of whether a dividend or 
distribution is considered ordinary will 
control whether OCC will make an 
adjustment, regardless of the form such 
dividends or distributions take.
22
 
Likewise, Rule 2803(c)(3)(iv) would 
state that a distribution of non- 
transferrable property would be 
considered an event not ordinarily 
resulting in an adjustment. OCC asserts 
that, because distributions of non- 
transferable property cannot be traded 
on a national market or transferred 
through the facilities of a central 
securities depository clearing agency, 
there is no practical means to ascertain 
the trading price to provide a value, or 
to facilitate delivery of non-transferable 
distributions in fulfilment of option 
exercises and assignments.
23
OCC 
maintains that proposed Rule 
2803(c)(3)(iv) reflects past practice and 
that OCC would, nevertheless, retain 
general authority to make adjustments 
to non-transferable property on a case- 
by-case where necessary.
24
 
4. Cash in Lieu of Fractional 
Entitlements 
The Proposed Rule Change would 
address adjustments in the context of 
cash in lieu of fractional 
entititlements.
25
First, OCC proposes a 
clarification related to cash in lieu of 
fractional entitlements, which would be 
added at the end of Rule 2803(c)(2). 
Currently, OCC generally will not make 
an adjustment to a stock option contract 
for any cash dividend or distribution by 
the issuer of the underlying security if 
such dividend or distribution is less 
than $0.125 per share. OCC indicates 
that this general practice would not 
change.
26
However, OCC would codify 
in a new, final sentence of Rule 
2803(c)(2) that, this general rule would 
not apply to contract adjustment 
determinations involving cash paid in 
lieu of fractional share entitlements for 
a stock option contract (e.g., in respect of stock rights, contingent value rights, 
or other distributions). OCC states that 
this proposed text is consistent with 
longstanding practices and is necessary 
to clarify that adjustments in lieu of 
property are governed by other 
provisions of proposed Rule 2803.
27
 
Secondly, Rule 2803(k) would 
provide that cash amounts in lieu of 
fractional share entitlements included 
in adjusted deliverables will generally 
be made in a manner consistent with 
any determinations by a central 
securities depository clearing agency 
(i.e., Depository Trust Company). OCC represents that Rule 2803(k) would 
reflect an established practice and 
clarify that, where a stock dividend or 
distribution by an issuer involves some 
cash amount in lieu of fractional share 
entitlements and OCC determines that 
an adjustment is necessary pursuant to 
its By-Laws and Rules, OCC will 
generally seek to align its distribution 
with the approach taken by the central

See Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47481–82. OCC cited to past Information Memos #54176, #36262, 
and #20861 as examples where adjustments were 
made after the cash-in-lieu price was available from 
the central securities depository clearing agency. Id. 29
As an example, OCC pointed to Information 
Memo #23267, writing that ‘‘on July 13, 2007, 
options on CBOT Holdings, Inc. (‘‘BOT’’) were 
adjusted to reflect the merger between BOT and 
CME Group Inc. (‘‘CME’’). Notice of Filing, 90 FR 
at 47482.The adjusted options deliverable became 
(1) 37 CME Group Inc. (‘‘CME’’) Common Shares 
and (2) cash in lieu of .5 fractional CME shares. 
However, pursuant to the terms of the corporate 
action, CME issued fractional shares instead of 
paying cash in lieu of fractional shares. Because 
OCC cannot facilitate settlement of fractional 
shares, it was determined that the closing price 
from the day prior to the consummation of the 
merger would be used to determine the cash-in-lieu 
amount.’’) Id. 30
Id. 
31
See Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47483. 32
Id. 
33
Id. As an example, OCC points to Information Memo #39462, which discussed the adjustment of 
options on Winthrop Realty Trust (‘‘FUR’’) on 
August 8, 2016, in response to the liquidation of the 
underlying security. Id. OCC states that ‘‘assets and liabilities of the trust were transferred to a 
liquidating trust, and each FUR share would be 
converted into a nontransferable Unit of Beneficial 
Interest in the liquidating trust. Since the timing 
and amount of any liquidating distributions were 
unknown and because the Unit of Beneficial 
Interest could not be transferred, the adjustment 
determination was made to set a cash value 
equivalent for FUR Shares using a high and low 
price from the last day of trading, thereby allowing 
settlement to occur in a timely manner.’’ Id.

that an option’s adjusted deliverable 
resulting from a corporate action reflects 
the amount of cash paid in lieu of 
fractional shares that the holder of 100 
shares of the underlying security 
receives from the corporate action.
28
 
OCC notes that because it cannot 
facilitate settlement of fractional shares, 
it may be necessary for OCC, in rare 
circumstances, to independently 
determine a cash in lieu price for 
fractional shares because of the terms of 
the underlying corporate action.
29
OCC 
states that in such uncommon cases, 
Rule 2803(k) would work in conjunction 
with Rule 2803(j) in determining the 
cash value of any distributed property.
30
 
OCC would retain its authority to 
determine the value of distributed 
property with respect to any 
adjustments, as currently laid out in 
Section 11A(e) of Article VI and the last 
sentence of Section 3(e) of Article XII of 
the By-Laws, and proposed to be 
consolidated and moved to Rule 2803(j). 
However, OCC proposes to add a second 
sentence to Rule 2803(j), explicitly 
providing that it may use this authority 
in circumstances that include but are 
not limited to cases in which OCC 
determines that the final amount or 
distribution resulting from a corporate 
action may not be determined for a long 
period. OCC maintains that the 
additional text would clarify that OCC 
would consider using its authority to 
determine the value of distributed 
property when OCC expects that it may 
take a long period of time to determine 
the final amount of a distribution 
resulting from a corporate action.
31
OCC 
states that if a lengthy delay to 
determine the distributed property 
value is expected, options or stock 
futures contracts may expire or mature 
prior to the time when the value is 
determined, which would leave such 
contract holders uncertain about the 
value of their position, and their 
positions subject to delayed settlement 
for an extended period of time.
32
In 
such situations, OCC represents that it 
is appropriate to use its existing 
authority to determine the cash value of 
distributed property.
33
 
5. Other Scenarios Affecting 
Adjustments 
Rule 2803(i) would provide that the 
deliverable resulting from an adjustment 
in the case of an election merger or 
similar event involving shareolder 
elections, such as shareholder election 
of a non-ordinary dividend, will 
generally be based on the consideration 
accruing to a non-electing shareholder if 
OCC determines in its sole discretion 
that it is readily able to facilitate 
delivery of that consideration. OCC 
states that this provision makes explicit 
a longstanding practice and provides 
additional details regarding corporate 
action events involving shareholder 
elections to reflect, to the extent 
possible, what a shareholder who does 
not make an election will receive.
34
 
OCC represents that there may be 
circumstances where it is not possible to 
determine an adjustment that aligns 
with the interest of a non-electing 
shareholder.
35
 
OCC proposes to add Rule 2803(l), 
which would provide that, in general, 
all contract adjustments will be made 
net of any relevant foreign withholding 
taxes, with the exception of events for 
which local tax authorities issue rulings 
that exempt certain groups from the 
withholding tax and it is reasonable that 
U.S. investors collectively can be 
included in such groups. OCC maintains 
that Rule 2803(l) clarifies to market 
participants that OCC’s contract 
adjustments will ordinarily include 
foreign withholding taxes, unless there 
is an exception from local tax 
authorities in the foreign jurisdiction of 
which OCC reasonably believes U.S. 
investors could avail themselves.
36
 
Additionally, OCC represents that it 
routinely investigates withholding tax 
information on foreign securities and 
intends to adjust options taking 
withholding tax into account in the 
manner described above when such 
information is readily available.
37
 
Rule 2803(m) would provide that all 
contract adjustments will be made on a 
per contract basis. OCC states that Rule 
2803(m) would improve the clarity and 
consistency of its Rules by explicitly 
describing the practice of exercising and 
assigning options based on a single 
contract as the lowest possible holding 
of an option.
38
OCC maintains that this 
existing practice is required for the 
proper functioning of the exercise and 
assignment process.
39
 
B. Non-Substantive Reorganization of 
Adjustment-Related Provisions 
As stated above, OCC proposes to 
rearrange adjustment-related provisions 
in its By-Laws and Rules.
40
The 
Proposed Rule Change would (i) 
relocate OCC’s existing adjustment- 
related provisions from its By-Laws to 
proposed Chapter XXVIII of the Rules, 
while making certain non-substantive 
clarifying changes to the relocated 
language; (ii) consolidate provisions 
regarding OCC’s adjustment authority 
and practices for actively traded 
products with similar methods of 
adjustments
41
to eliminate duplicative 
provisions (e.g., consolidating provisions for adjustments to stock 
futures and stock options); and (iii) 
update references to current adjustment 
By-Laws sections contained in other 
adjustment provisions of the By-Laws 
for products not actively traded, and 
with regard to governance provisions for 
amendments to Rules and By-Laws.
42
 
1. Relocation 
Provisions related to adjustments of 
contracts currently are set forth in 
various parts of OCC’s By-Laws, 
including, for example, in Article VI, 
Section 11 and 11A, covering options 
contract adjustments, and in Article XII, 
Sections 3, 4, and 4A, covering futures 
contracts and futures options 
adjustments. The Proposed Rule Change 
would relocate these adjustment-related 
provisions from the By-Laws to a single 
location in OCC’s Rules, the newly 
numbered Chapter XXVIII. OCC also 
proposes to make clarifying edits to 
certain text in these provisions,

See Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47472 (‘‘[. . .] e.g., where OCC’s adjustment determinations are the same for options contracts and futures 
contracts.’’). 
44
See Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47471–72. OCC represents that ‘‘when OCC makes a determination 
to adjust an options or futures contract, all market 
participants holding options or futures contracts are 
uniformly subject to OCC’s adjustment 
determination.’’ Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47471. 
45
See Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47471, n. 10. 46
See Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47471–47480. 
47
No substantive changes are being proposed to 
these factors, which are (i) fairness to holders and 
writers (or purchasers and sellers) of the affected 
contracts; (ii) the maintenance of a fair and orderly 
market in the affected contracts; (iii) consistency of 
interpretation and practice; (iv) efficiency of 
exercise settlement procedures; and (v) the 
coordination with other clearing agencies of the 
clearance and settlement of transactions in the 
underlying interest. 
48
See Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47480–81 (‘‘For example, Section 11(a) of Article VI of the By-Laws 
(regarding options), Section 3(b) of Article XII of the 
By-Laws (regarding futures), and Section 3(b) of 
Article XVII (regarding index options and certain 
other cash-settled options) each provide, among 
other things, that OCC shall determine whether to 
make adjustments to reflect particular events in 
respect of an underlying interest based on OCC’s 
judgment as to what is appropriate for the 
protection of investors and the public interest, 
taking into account such factors as fairness to 
holders and writers (or purchasers and sellers) of 
the instruments, the maintenance of a fair and 
orderly market in the affected contracts, and 
consistency of interpretation and practice.’’). See 
also Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47481, n. 13 (‘‘The adjustment provisions for options contracts and 
futures contracts also specify two additional criteria 
to be considered: (i) the efficiency of exercise 
settlement procedures and (ii) the coordination 
with other clearing agencies of the clearance and 
settlement of transactions in the underlying 
interest. OCC proposes that all instruments would 
be subject to these two additional criteria pursuant 
to proposed Rule 2801, which OCC believes are also 
potentially relevant considerations for determining 
adjustments for index options and certain other 
cash-settled options.’’). 
49
See Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47481. 50
See Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47484, for additional detail. 
51
See Notice of Filing, 90 FR at 47484. including where the language pertaining 
to different instruments is similar.
43
The 
proposal would update cross-references 
to corresponding Rules, as well as add 
italicized headers to most of the 
paragraphs and subparagraphs in 
Chapter XXVIII of the Rules to provide 
a brief preview and description of the 
provisions. OCC states that this 
relocation will improve readability, 
promote clarity and consistency, and 
increase understanding of the process 
governing adjustments for all 
instruments.
44
Additionally, OCC 
represents that these adjustment-related 
provisions are more appropriately 
organized as Rules, rather than By-Laws, 
because the relocation would more 
accurately reflect typical corporate 
bylaws, which usually focus on 
governance and administrative matters 
of an entity, such as OCC.
45
 
Chapter XXVIII would be divided into 
five rules, numbering from 2801 to 
2805. A summary of each rule follows, 
while further details and comparative 
charts are available in the Notice of 
Filing.
46
Other than those changes 
described above in Section II.A., OCC is 
not proposing to make substantive 
changes to the rules that it propose to 
move. Rule 2801 would describe how 
OCC makes adjustment determinations, 
including the factors
47
it takes into 
account in making these determinations, 
and would include the provision that 
every adjustment determination shall be 
within OCC’s sole discretion and shall 
be conclusive and binding on all 
investors, and not subject to review. 
Rule 2802 primarily would discuss the 
Securities Committee’s authority to 
adopt statements of policies and 
interpretations regarding contract 
adjustments, as well as its composition 
and governance. Rule 2803 would 
comprise provisions governing the 
details of the adjustments, including the 
subprovision stating that when a 
corporate action impacts an underlying 
security, OCC may adjust any or a 
combination of the following regarding 
all outstanding stock option contracts 
and stock futures in the underlying 
security: (1) the number of shares; (2) 
the unit of trading in the case of an 
options contract or the unit of trading 
(or settlement price) in the case of a 
stock future; (3) the exercise price in the 
case of an options contact; and (4) the 
underlying security. Rule 2803 also 
would identify events ordinarily and 
not ordinarily resulting in a contract 
adjustment, in addition to providing for 
other types of scenarios affecting 
adjustments, including the timing of 
cash value determinations and the 
determination of cash amounts in lieu of 
fractional share entitlements. Rule 2804 
would pertain to the adjustment of 
index options and futures and certain 
other cash-settled options and futures. 
Rule 2805 would cover the adjustment 
of cash-settled foreign currency options 
and futures. 
2. Consolidation 
Currently, the provisions related to 
contract adjustments for various types of 
instruments cleared by OCC are 
dispersed throughout the By-Laws, 
including, for example, those covering 
options contracts in Article VI; futures, 
futures options, and commodity options 
in Article XII; index options and certain 
other cash-settled options in Article 
XVII; and cash-settled foreign currency 
options in Article XXII. OCC represents 
that these adjustment-related provisions 
often are substantially similar or 
identical to one another.
48
To 
streamline these adjustment-related 
provisions currently found in the By- 
Laws, OCC proposes to consolidate their 
relevant text into Chapter XXVIII of the 
Rules, while ensuring the terminology 
applies to the specific product.
49
For 
instance, proposed Rule 2803(h) would 
account for the fact that options 
contracts involve an exercise price 
while a stock future involves a 
settlement price. Accordingly, where 
OCC proposes to integrate text about 
stock futures into existing language in 
an options-related adjustment provision, 
OCC proposes to add a reference to a 
stock future’s settlement price where the 
current provision references an exercise 
price. 
3. Updated References 
In light of the relocation and 
consolidation discussed above in 
Sections II.B.1.–2., OCC proposes to 
make non-substantive updates to 
adjustment-related references in the 
Rules and By-Laws. Certain provisions 
in OCC’s By-Laws discuss products that 
are not actively traded and their related 
contract adjustments. Currently, these 
provisions state that, generally, 
adjustments for inactive products will 
be governed by Sections 11 and 11A of 
Article VI of the By-Laws or, in the case 
of Packaged Spread Options, Section 3 
of Article XVII of the By-Laws. Since the 
Proposed Rule Change would relocate 
these adjustment-related provisions 
from the By-Laws to the Rules, cross- 
references to inactive products and their 
contract adjustments would be updated 
to correspond to the applicable 
provisions in Chapter XXVIII of the 
Rules. Specific modifications would 
cover cross-references to binary options 
and trade options, foreign currency 
options, yield-based Treasury options, 
BOUNDS, and packaged spread 
options.
50
OCC represents that even 
though these proposed changes are not 
substantive, they are necessary to ensure 
consistency in the Rules.
51
 
Additionally, Article XI, Section 1 of 
the By-Laws states that amendment to 
certain provisions of the By-Laws, 
including Sections 11 and 11A of 
Article VI, requires approval of the 
holders of all outstanding Common 
Stock of OCC. However, OCC proposes 
to relocate the text of Sections 11 and 
11A of Article VI of the By Laws to the 
Rules. As such, the Proposed Rule 
Change would add language to Section 
2 of Article XI of the By-Laws cross- 
referencing the Rules and specifying 
that Chapter XXVIII of the Rules may 
not be amended by action of the Board 
of Directors without the approval of the

III. Discussion and Commission 
Findings 
Section 19(b)(2)(C) of the Exchange 
Act directs the Commission to approve 
a proposed rule change of a self- 
regulatory organization if it finds that 
such proposed rule change is consistent 
with the requirements of the Exchange 
Act and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to such 
organization.
52
Under the Commission’s 
Rules of Practice, the ‘‘burden to 
demonstrate that a proposed rule change 
is consistent with the Exchange Act and 
the rules and regulations issued 
thereunder . . . is on the self-regulatory 
organization [‘SRO’] that proposed the 
rule change.’’
53
 
The description of a proposed rule 
change, its purpose and operation, its 
effect, and a legal analysis of its 
consistency with applicable 
requirements must all be sufficiently 
detailed and specific to support an 
affirmative Commission finding,
54
and 
any failure of an SRO to provide this 
information may result in the 
Commission not having a sufficient 
basis to make an affirmative finding that 
a proposed rule change is consistent 
with the Exchange Act and the 
applicable rules and regulations.
55
 
Moreover, ‘‘unquestioning reliance’’ on 
an SRO’s representations in a proposed 
rule change is not sufficient to justify 
Commission approval of a proposed rule 
change.
56
 
After carefully considering the 
Proposed Rule Change, the Commission 
finds that the Proposed Rule Change is 
consistent with the requirements of the 
Exchange Act and the rules and 
regulations thereunder applicable to 
OCC. More specifically, the Commission 
finds that the Proposed Rule Change is 
consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of 
the Exchange Act,
57
and with Exchange 
Act Rule 17ad–22(e)(21)
58
as described 
in detail below. 
A. Consistency With Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Exchange Act 
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Exchange 
Act requires, among other things, that a 
clearing agency’s rules are designed to 
‘‘promote the prompt and accurate 
clearance and settlement of securities 
transactions and, to the extent 
applicable, derivatives agreements, 
contracts, and transactions.’’
59
Based on 
the Commission’s review of the record, 
and for the reasons described below, the 
changes described above are consistent 
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Exchange 
Act.
60
 
As discussed above, the proposed 
changes would codify in OCC’s Rules 
certain longstanding adjustment 
practices that previously had been 
outlined in non-consecutive, 
sporadically released Information 
Memos. These practices, although found 
in separate guidance documents, 
describe specific situations where OCC 
used a consistent process to make 
contract adjustments to preserve the 
economic value of the affected 
instruments. By transfering these 
practices out of guidance and codifying 
them as Rules, the Proposed Rule 
Change helps strengthen the practices’ 
application to and impact on the 
instruments OCC clears and settles, and, 
as such, to promote the prompt and 
accurate settlement of such transactions. 
Additionally, the remaining adjustment- 
related text would be consolidated and 
relocated from OCC’s By-Laws to a 
single location in OCC’s Rules, leaving 
intact the factors behind adjustment 
determinations, detailed procedures for 
stock adjustments in cases of corporate 
actions affecting underlying stocks, and 
events ordinarily and not ordinarily 
resulting in contract adjustments, 
among other substantive provisions. 
Thus the existing adjustment process 
would remain unchanged, continuing to 
promote the prompt and accurate 
clearance and settlement of transactions. 
Accordingly, the Proposed Rule 
Change is consistent with the 
requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of 
the Exchange Act.
61
 
B. Consistency With Rule 17ad–22(e)(21) 
Under the Exchange Act 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(21) under the 
Exchange Act requires, in part, that a 
covered clearing agency establish, 
implement, maintain, and enforce 
written policies and procedures that are 
reasonably designed to be efficient and 
effective in meeting the requirements of 
its participants and the markets it 
serves.
62
 
As described above, OCC proposes to 
codify longstanding practices related to 
its contract adjustment process and 
reorganize adjustment-related 
provisions into a single chapter in the 
Rules, while consolidating similarly 
worded provisions and updating cross- 
references. The proposed Chapter 
XXVIII, which contains Rules 2801 
through 2805, would list specific types 
of instruments subject to the 
adjustment-related rules; clarify the 
Securities Committee’s authority; 
outline additional events not ordinarily 
resulting in contract adjustment; 
describe in greater detail the adjustment 
process concerning cash in lieu of 
fractional entitlements; and state in 
writing the adjustment practices related 
to election mergers, foreign withholding 
taxes, and per-contract basis treatment. 
The Proposed Rule Change also would 
relocate adjustment-related provisions 
from the By-Laws to the Rules, 
consolidate substantially similar or 
identical language from separately laid 
out provisions, and update cross- 
references to adjustment-related 
provisions across the Rules and By- 
Laws. 
The Proposed Rule Change is 
consistent with Rule 17Ad–22(e)(21)
63
 
because it is designed as a continuation 
of established and publicly released 
practices related to contract adjustment. 
By codifying longstanding processes, as 
previously described in public but 
disparately released Information 
Memos, the Proposed Rule Change 
helps clarify such processes and bolster 
their impact as OCC Rules governing the 
adjustment process. This clarity and 
impact, in turn, leads to more 
effectiveness in meeting the 
requirements of OCC’s participants, 
specifically, their need to understand 
the details behind the contract 
adjustment determinations by which 
they are bound. Similarly, the non- 
substantive reorganization of 
adjustment-related provisions 
streamlines substantially similar or 
identical text into a single location, and 
better reflects the typical scope and 
purpose of an entity’s corporate by-laws. 
As a result, the non-substantive re- 
organization helps to increase the 
consistency, readability, and, thus, the 
efficiency of OCC’s Rules and By-Laws. 
Accordingly, the Proposed Rule 
Change is consistent with Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(21) under the Exchange Act.

V. Accelerated Approval of Proposed 
Rule Change, as Modified by Partial 
Amendment No. 1 
The Commission finds good cause, 
pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the 
Exchange Act,
65
to approve the 
proposed rule change prior to the 30th 
day after the date of publication of 
notice of the filing of Partial 
Amendment No. 1 in the Federal 
Register. As discussed above, Partial 
Amendment No. 1 modified the original 
proposed rule change to (1) correct 
proposed rule text describing the 
current composition and governance of 
OCC’s Securities Committee;
66
and (2) 
conform cross references in OCC’s 
interpretive guidance to the restatement 
of the contract adjustment rules 
proposed in the Notice of Filing. Partial 
Amendment No. 1 does not change the 
purpose of or basis for the proposed 
changes. 
For similar reasons as discussed 
above, the Commission finds that Partial 
Amendment No. 1 is consistent with the 
requirement that OCC’s rules be 
designed to promote the prompt and 
accurate clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions under Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Exchange Act.
67
 
Accordingly, the Commission finds 
good cause, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) 
of the Exchange Act, to approve the 
proposed rule change, as modified by 
Partial Amendment No. 1, on an 
accelerated basis, pursuant to Section 
19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act.
68
 
VI. Conclusion 
On the basis of the foregoing, the 
Commission finds that the proposed 
rule change, as modified by Partial 
Amendment No. 1, is consistent with 
the requirements of the Exchange Act, 
and in particular, the requirements of 
Section 17A of the Exchange Act
69
and 
the rules and regulations thereunder. 
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act,
70
 
that the proposed rule change (SR– 
OCC–2025–017), as modified by Partial 
Amendment No. 1, be, and hereby is, 
approved. 
For the Commission, by the Division of 
Trading and Markets, pursuant to delegated 
authority.

of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934

notice is hereby given that, on December 
3, 2025, New York Stock Exchange LLC 
(‘‘NYSE’’ or the ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with 
the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ‘‘Commission’’) the 
proposed rule change as described in 
Items I, II, and III below, which Items 
have been prepared by the self- 
regulatory organization. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed 
Company Manual (the ‘‘Manual’’) to 
establish that an issuer must maintain a 
minimum trading price per share in 
order to remain listed on the Exchange. 
The proposed rule change is available 
on the Exchange’s website at 
www.nyse.com, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
self-regulatory organization included 
statements concerning the purpose of, 
and basis for, the proposed rule change 
and discussed any comments it received 
on the proposed rule change. The text 
of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. 
The Exchange has prepared summaries, 
set forth in sections A, B, and C below, 
of the most significant parts of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
Section 802.01 of the Manual sets 
forth minimum quantitative and 
qualitative continued listing standards 
for securities listed on the Exchange. 
Issuers of common stock are required to 
maintain certain quantitative minimum 
standards related to stockholders,
4
 
stockholders’ equity and global market 
capitalization,
5
and minimum global 
market capitalization.
6
In addition, 
Section 802.01D of the Manual also sets 
forth qualitative continued listing 
standards related to, among other 
things, reduction in operating assets, 
change in primary business focus and

conduct not in keeping with sound

7
 
While the Exchange believes that its 
existing rules provide meaningful 
assurance that only financially sound 
and quality issuers remain listed on the 
Exchange, it has noticed a recent 
increase in companies trading on public 
markets that have a very low trading 
price per share. The Exchange believes 
that an issuer having this characteristic 
is potentially susceptible to 
manipulation and more likely to 
experience trading volatility in its 
shares. As such, the Exchange now 
proposes to amend Section 802.01C to 
specify that an issuer must maintain a 
certain minimum trading price per share 
in order to remain listed on the 
Exchange. 
Section 802.01C of the Manual states 
that a company will be considered to be 
below compliance standards if the 
average closing price of a security as 
reported on the consolidated tape is less 
than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 
trading-day period (the ‘‘Price Criteria’’). 
Once notified of its noncompliance with 
the Price Criteria, a company must bring 
its share price and average share price 
back above $1.00 by six months 
following receipt of the notification. A 
company must notify the Exchange of 
its intent to cure the Price Criteria 
deficiency and can regain compliance at 
any time during the six-month cure 
period if on the last trading day of any 
calendar month during the cure period 
the company has a closing share price 
of at least $1.00 and an average closing 
share price of at least $1.00 over the 30 
trading-day period ending on the last 
trading day of that month. In the event 
that at the expiration of the six-month 
cure period, both a $1.00 closing share 
price on the last trading day of the cure 
period and a $1.00 average closing share 
price over the 30 trading-day period 
ending on the last trading day of the 
cure period are not attained, the 
Exchange will commence suspension 
and delisting procedures. 
The Exchange maintains an ongoing 
dialogue with companies approaching 
noncompliance with the Price Criteria 
as well as companies working through 
a cure period. Regardless of where an 
issuer stands in its cure period, in the 
event that a stock trades below $0.10 per 
share, the Exchange promptly initiates 
suspension and delisting procedures. 
Recently, the Exchange has become 
aware of an increasing industry-wide 
trend of low-priced stocks trading on 
national securities exchanges. The 
Exchange believes that low priced 
stocks have a greater chance of being 
manipulated or experiencing trading 
volatility. Accordingly, the Exchange 
believes it is appropriate to establish a 
minimum trading price for a security to 
remain listed on the Exchange. 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Section 802.01C of the Manual to 
specify that if a security’s close price 
per share is less than $0.25 (the 
‘‘Minimum Trading Price’’) on any 
trading day, the Exchange will 
immediately suspend trading and 
commence delisting proceedings. In the 
Exchange’s experience securities that 
trade at abnormally low prices are 
typically unable to recover to any 
meaningful degree. Accordingly, the 
Exchange proposes to specify in Section 
802.01C that a security that closes below 
the Minimum Trading Price will not be 
entitled to submit a plan to regain 
compliance pursuant to Sections 802.02 
and 802.03 of the Company Guide. The 
Exchange proposes to make this change 
effective October 1, 2026. Providing a 
transition period before the rule is 
effective will afford issuers time to 
implement reverse stock splits to 
increase their share price before the new 
requirement is in place. The Exchange 
notes that its rules prohibiting one or 
more reverse stock splits with a 
cumulative ratio of 200 shares or more 
to one in a two-year period will remain 
in place.
8
 
The Exchange also proposes to clarify 
that, consistent with its general 
authority under Section 802.1D of the 
Manual to suspend trading in the event 
of any condition that makes further 
dealings on the Exchange inadvisable or 
unwarranted, it may suspend trading in 
a security that has experienced a 
precipitous decline and is at an 
abnormally low level even if such 
security has not fallen below the 
Minimum Trading Price at the market 
close. In the Exchange’s experience, 
under those conditions a security’s 
trading price is generally unable to 
recover and it is appropriate for the 
Exchange to take action. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(the ‘‘Act’’) generally
9
and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act
10
 
in particular, in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and in general to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
In particular, the Exchange believes 
that establishing a Minimum Trading 
Price for securities listed on the 
Exchange is designed to protect 
investors and the public interest and to 
remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system because 
the Exchange believes that companies 
with a very low price per share are more 
susceptible to trading volatility and 
market manipulation. By adopting clear 
standards that prohibit such companies 
from remaining listed on the Exchange, 
the Exchange is therefore protecting 
investors and the public interest. 
As discussed above, the Exchange 
believes that securities that trade below 
the Minimum Trading Price are more 
susceptible to trading volatility and 
market manipulation. The Exchange 
believes it is appropriate to establish a 
clear continued listing standard in this 
regard to limit the likelihood of 
problematic trading and provide clarity 
to listed issuers. Further, the Exchange 
believes it is appropriate to provide 
issuers with a transition period before 
effectiveness of the Minimum Trading 
Price requirement to afford time to 
implement a reverse stock split in 
anticipation of the new requirement. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
Exchange notes that the proposed 
amendment would establish a minimum 
trading price standard for issuers listed 
on the Exchange. The Exchange believes 
that securities that trade at very low 
prices are more likely to experience 
trading volatility and potentially be the 
subject of manipulation. The Exchange 
believes it is appropriate to address 
these concerns with the adoption of 
clear continued listing standards. The 
Exchange does not believe its proposed 
rules would impose any burden on 
competition as all exchanges that list 
equity securities maintain a set of 
continued listing standards appropriate 
for companies listed on their respective 
exchange.

Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were solicited

notice is hereby given that on December

change as described in Items I, II, and 
III below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend the 
NYSE Arca Equities Fees and Charges 
(‘‘Fee Schedule’’) to (1) adopt a new 
pricing tier, Retail Tier 5, (2) eliminate 
current Retail Step-Up Tier and footnote 
(e) under the Retail Tiers pricing table, 
and (3) offer an alternative volume 
requirement to qualify for Retail Order 
rates. The Exchange proposes to 
implement the fee changes effective 
December 1, 2025. The proposed rule 
change is available on the Exchange’s 
website at www.nyse.com and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
self-regulatory organization included 
statements concerning the purpose of, 
and basis for, the proposed rule change 
and discussed any comments it received 
on the proposed rule change. The text 
of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. 
The Exchange has prepared summaries, 
set forth in sections A, B, and C below, 
of the most significant parts of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend the 
Fee Schedule to (1) adopt a new pricing 
tier, Retail Tier 5, (2) eliminate current 
Retail Step-Up Tier and footnote (e) 
under the Retail Tiers pricing table, and 
(3) offer an alternative volume 
requirement to qualify for Retail Order 
rates. 
The proposed change responds to the 
current competitive environment where 
ETP Holders have a choice among both 
exchange and off-exchange venues of 
where to route marketable retail order 
flow. 
The Exchange proposes to implement 
the fee changes effective December 1, 
2025. 
Background 
The Exchange operates in a highly 
competitive market. The Commission 
has repeatedly expressed its preference 
for competition over regulatory 
intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities 
markets. In Regulation NMS, the 
Commission highlighted the importance 
of market forces in determining prices 
and SRO revenues and, also, recognized 
that current regulation of the market 
system ‘‘has been remarkably successful 
in promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
3
 
While Regulation NMS has enhanced 
competition, it has also fostered a 
‘‘fragmented’’ market structure where 
trading in a single stock can occur 
across multiple trading centers. When 
multiple trading centers compete for 
order flow in the same stock, the 
Commission has recognized that ‘‘such 
competition can lead to the 
fragmentation of order flow in that 
stock.’’

Indeed, equity trading is 
currently dispersed across 17 
exchanges,

See Fee Schedule, Retail Tiers table under Section VI. Tier Rates—Round Lots and Odd Lots 
(Per Share Price $1.00 or Above). As discussed 
below, this proposed rule change also proposes to 
eliminate the current Retail Step-Up Tier and the 
pricing established in footnote (e) in the Retail Tiers 
pricing table. 
10
Pursuant to footnote (d) under Retail Tiers, ETP 
Holders that qualify for proposed Retail Tier 5 will 
not be charged a fee or provided a credit for Retail 
Orders where each side of the executed order (1) 
shares the same MPID and (2) is a Retail Order. 
11
Pursuant to footnote (d) under Retail Tiers, ETP 
Holders that qualify for the Retail Step-Up Tier are 
trading systems,
6
and broker-dealer 
internalizers and wholesalers, all 
competing for order flow. Based on 
publicly available information, no single 
exchange currently has more than 17% 
market share.
7
Therefore, no exchange 
possesses significant pricing power in 
the execution of equity order flow. More 
specifically, the Exchange currently has 
less than 12% market share of executed 
volume of equities trading.
8
 
The Exchange believes that the ever- 
shifting market share among the 
exchanges from month to month 
demonstrates that market participants 
can move order flow, or discontinue or 
reduce use of certain categories of 
products. While it is not possible to 
know a firm’s reason for shifting order 
flow, the Exchange believes that one 
such reason is because of fee changes at 
any of the registered exchanges or non- 
exchange venues to which a firm routes 
order flow. The competition for Retail 
Orders is even more stark, particularly 
as it relates to exchange versus off- 
exchange venues. 
The Exchange thus needs to compete 
in the first instance with non-exchange 
venues for Retail Order flow, and with 
the 16 other exchange venues for that 
Retail Order flow that is not directed 
off-exchange. Accordingly, competitive 
forces compel the Exchange to use 
exchange transaction fees and credits, 
particularly as they relate to competing 
for Retail Order flow, because market 
participants can readily trade on 
competing venues if they deem pricing 
levels at those other venues to be more 
favorable. 
To respond to this competitive 
environment, the Exchange has 
established a number of Retail Tiers that 
are designed to provide an incentive for 
ETP Holders to route Retail Orders to 
the Exchange by providing higher 
credits for adding liquidity correlated to 
an ETP Holder’s higher trading volume 
in Retail Orders on the Exchange. 
Currently, under four of these five tiers, 
ETP Holders also do not pay a fee when 
such Retail Orders have a time-in-force 
of Day that remove liquidity from the 
Exchange. 
Proposed Rule Change 
Retail Tier 5 
The proposed rule change is designed 
to be available to all ETP Holders on the 
Exchange and is intended to provide 
ETP Holders an opportunity to receive 
enhanced rebates by quoting and trading 
more on the Exchange. 
As noted above, the Exchange 
currently provides tiered credits for 
Retail Orders that provide liquidity on 
the Exchange. Specifically, Section VI. 
Tier Rates—Round Lots and Odd Lots 
(Per Share Price $1.00 or Above), 
provides a credit of $0.0038 per share 
for Adding under Retail Tier 1, a credit 
of $0.0037 per share for Adding under 
Retail Tier 2, a credit of $0.0036 per 
share for Adding under Retail Tier 3, a 
credit of $0.0034 per share for Adding 
under Retail Tier 4, and a credit of 
$0.0035 per share for Adding under 
Retail Step-Up Tier.

The Retail Tiers 
are designed to encourage ETP Holders 
that provide displayed liquidity in 
Retail Orders on the Exchange to 
increase that order flow, which would 
benefit all ETP Holders by providing 
greater execution opportunities on the 
Exchange. In order to provide an 
incentive for ETP Holders to direct 
providing displayed Retail Order flow to 
the Exchange, the credits increase in the 
various tiers based on increased levels 
of volume directed to the Exchange. 
With this proposed rule change, the 
Exchange proposes to adopt a new 
pricing tier, Retail Tier 5, which would 
provide a credit of $0.0035 per share to 
ETP Holders that execute an ADV of 
Retail Orders with a time-in-force of Day 
that add or remove liquidity during the 
billing month that is equal to at least 
0.15% of CADV. Under proposed Retail 
Tier 5, ETP Holders could alternatively 
qualify for the proposed credit if the 
ETP Holder executes an ADV of Retail 
Orders with a time-in-force of Day that 
add or remove liquidity during the 
billing month that is equal to at least 
0.075% of CADV, combined with 
Customer and Professional Customer 
Posting Volume by an OTP Holder or 
OTP Firm affiliated with the ETP Holder 
that is equal to at least 0.40% of TCADV 
in all options classes. As with current 
Retail Tier 1, Retail Tier 2, Retail Tier 
3 and Retail Step-Up Tier, ETP Holders 
that qualify for proposed Retail Tier 5 
would also not be charged a fee for 
Retail Orders with a time-in-force of Day 
below a prescribed threshold that 
remove liquidity, and will be charged a 
fee of $0.0025 per share if trading by the 
ETP Holder in such orders exceeds the 
prescribed threshold.
10
 
The purpose of the proposed rule 
change is to encourage greater 
participation from ETP Holders, 
including on the Exchange’s options 
platform, and promote additional 
liquidity in Retail Orders. As described 
above, ETP Holders with retail day 
orders have a choice of where to send 
those orders. The Exchange believes that 
the proposed new increased credit and 
lower fee to remove should encourage 
more ETP Holders to route their Retail 
Orders with a time-in-force of Day to the 
Exchange rather than to a competing 
exchange. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed new pricing tier will 
incentivize ETP Holders to route their 
liquidity-providing order flow to the 
Exchange in order to qualify for the tier, 
which provides a higher credit than that 
currently available under current Retail 
Tier 4. This in turn would support the 
quality of price discovery on the 
Exchange and provide additional price 
improvement opportunities for 
incoming orders. The Exchange believes 
that by correlating the amount of the 
credit and fee to the level of orders sent 
by an ETP Holder that add or remove 
liquidity, the Exchange’s fee structure 
would continue to incentivize ETP 
Holders to submit more orders with a 
time-in-force of Day that add liquidity to 
or remove liquidity from the Exchange, 
thereby increasing the potential for 
price improvement to incoming 
marketable orders and higher fill rates to 
resting limit orders on the Exchange. 
Retail Step-Up Tier 
The Exchange currently provides a 
credit of $0.0035 per share under the 
Retail Step-Up Tier if an ETP Holder 
executes an ADV of Retail Orders with 
a time-in-force of Day that add or 
remove liquidity during the billing 
month that is equal to at least 0.075% 
of CADV. ETP Holders that qualify for 
the Retail-Step Up Tier are also not 
charged a fee for Retail Orders with a 
time-in-force of Day below a prescribed 
threshold that remove liquidity, and are 
charged a fee of $0.0025 per share if 
trading by the ETP Holder in such 
orders exceeds the prescribed 
threshold.

Dollar Plus Consolidated Volume means the

eliminate current Retail Step-Up Tier 
and remove the tier from the Fee 
Schedule. The current Retail Step-Up 
Tier has begun to be underutilized by 
ETP Holders. The Exchange has 
therefore determined to eliminate the 
pricing tier from the Fee Schedule. 
For the same reason, the Exchange 
also proposes to eliminate the pricing 
established in footnote (e) from the 
Retail Tiers pricing table. Footnote (e) 
currently provides that ETP Holders that 
increase Retail Orders with a time-in- 
force of Day that add and remove that 
is an increase over May 2022 of at least 
0.05% of CADV qualify for no fee for 
Retail Removing with a time-in-force of 
Day for the first 170 million shares in 
the month, and a fee of $0.0025 for 
shares above 170 million shares in the 
month. With the elimination of footnote 
(e), ETP Holders would be charged a fee 
for Retail Orders with a time-in-force of 
Day unless qualifying for the Retail 
Tiers. The Exchange believes 
streamlining the Fee Schedule by 
removing underutilized pricing 
incentives, such as the one in footnote 
(e), would add clarity to the Fee 
Schedule and improve transparency for 
the benefit of all market participants. 
Retail Order Rates 
Currently, the Exchange offers a 
$0.0025 per share fee for Retail Orders 
with a time-in-force of Day that remove 
liquidity under Retail Tier 1, Retail Tier 
2, Retail Tier 3 and Retail Step-Up Tier 
if an ETP Holder executes 170 million 
or more shares of such orders in a 
billing month, with the first 170 million 
shares of such orders not charged a fee. 
The Exchange proposes to offer a 
$0.0025 per share fee for Retail Orders 
with a time-in-force of Day that remove 
liquidity under Retail Tier 1, Retail Tier 
2, Retail Tier 3 and under proposed new 
Retail Tier 5 if an ETP Holder executes 
170 million or more shares of such 
orders in a billing month or 0.055% of 
Dollar Plus Consolidated Volume,
12
up 
to 250 million shares a month, 
whichever is higher, where the first 170 
million shares of such orders or 0.055% 
of Dollar Plus Consolidated Volume, up 
to 250 million shares, whichever is 
higher, would not be charged a fee. 
For example, assume a month of 20 
trading days where Dollar Plus 
Consolidated Volume is 40 billion 
shares each day. 
€On the first day, the cap based on Dollar Plus Consolidated Volume is 22 
million shares (0.055% of 40 billion 
shares month to date). 
€On day 2, the cap based on Dollar Plus Consolidated Volume is 44 million 
shares (0.055% of 80 billion shares 
month to date). 
€On day 5, the cap based on Dollar Plus Consolidated Volume is 110 
million shares (0.055% of 200 billion 
shares month to date). 
€By day 8, the cap based on Dollar Plus Consilidated Volume is 176 million 
shares (0.055% of 320 billion shares 
month to date). With this proposed rule 
change, the cap based on Dollar Plus 
Consolidated Volume is higher than the 
current 170 million shares cap, so ETP 
holders are not charged if their trading 
volume is under 176 million shares, 
versus the current 170 million shares 
cap. 
€By day 12, the cap based on Dollar Plus Consolidated Volume is 264 
million shares, thereby reaching the 
maximum cap of 250 million shares, 
i.e., the greater of 170 million shares or 264 million shares based on Dollar Plus 
Consolidated Volume (0.055% of 480 
billion shares month to date, subject to 
the maximum cap). In this example, 
once the 250 million shares cap is 
reached, Retail Orders with a time-in- 
force of Day submitted by an ETP 
Holder that remove liquidity would be 
charged the current fee of $0.0025 per 
share for the excess remove volume over 
the 250 million shares cap. 
The proposed rule change is designed 
to be available to all ETP Holders on the 
Exchange that qualify for the Retail 
Tiers and thus provide ETP Holders an 
opportunity to receive enhanced rebates 
by quoting and trading more on the 
Exchange. The Exchange notes that the 
current fee of $0.0025 per share for 
Retail Orders would not change as a 
result of this proposed rule change. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change would continue to 
encourage additional liquidity on the 
Exchange by providing additional 
determinacy to the Fee Schedule to 
enable market participants to determine 
what fee or rebate level would be 
applicable to any submitted order at the 
time of execution. 
The Exchange believes that it is 
reasonable to charge ETP Holders a fee 
for Retail Orders with a time-in-force of 
Day that remove liquidity and exceed a 
specified monthly shares threshold. The 
Exchange notes that other marketplaces 
offer various incentives based on trading 
activity. For instance, pursuant to its 
Retail Order Process, Nasdaq Stock 
Market LLC (‘‘Nasdaq’’) charges a fee of 
$0.0025 per share for shares executed in 
excess of 8 million shares in the month 
that remove liquidity while not charging 
a fee for shares executed below 8 
million shares in the month that remove 
liquidity.
13
 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
Section 6(b) of the Act,
14
in general, and 
furthers the objectives of Sections 
6(b)(4) and (5) of the Act,
15
in particular, 
because it provides for the equitable 
allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and 
other charges among its members, 
issuers and other persons using its 
facilities and does not unfairly 
discriminate between customers, 
issuers, brokers or dealers. 
The Proposal Is Reasonable 
As discussed above, the Exchange 
operates in a highly fragmented and 
competitive market. The Commission 
has repeatedly expressed its preference 
for competition over regulatory 
intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities 
markets. Specifically, in Regulation 
NMS, the Commission highlighted the 
importance of market forces in 
determining prices and SRO revenues 
and, also, recognized that current 
regulation of the market system ‘‘has 
been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
16
 
Given this competitive environment, 
the proposal represents a reasonable 
attempt to attract additional order flow 
to the Exchange. 
As noted above, the competition for 
Retail Order flow is stark given the 
amount of retail orders that are routed 
to non-exchange venues. The Exchange 
believes that the ever-shifting market 
share among the exchanges from month 
to month demonstrates that market 
participants can shift order flow, or 
discontinue or reduce use of certain 
categories of products, in response to fee 
changes. ETP Holders can choose from 
any one of the 17 currently operating 
registered exchanges, and numerous off- 
exchange venues, to route such order 
flow. Accordingly, competitive forces 
constrain exchange transaction fees, 
particularly as they relate to competing 
for retail orders. Stated otherwise, 
changes to exchange transaction fees

See supra, notes 17–18. 
can have a direct effect on the ability of 
an exchange to compete for order flow. 
Retail Tier 5 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
change to adopt the Retail Tier 5 pricing 
tier is reasonable because it would 
provide ETP Holders with an additional 
incentive to route their retail orders to 
the Exchange, which would result in 
increased liquidity on the Exchange. All 
ETP Holders would benefit from the 
greater amounts of liquidity on the 
Exchange, which would represent a 
wider range of execution opportunities. 
The Exchange notes that market 
participants are free to shift their order 
flow to competing venues if they believe 
other markets offer more favorable fees 
and credits. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
change is also reasonable because the 
proposed credit would continue to 
encourage ETP Holders to send Retail 
Orders to the Exchange to qualify for the 
proposed pricing tier. As noted above, 
the Exchange operates in a highly 
competitive environment, particularly 
for attracting Retail Order flow that 
provides displayed liquidity on an 
exchange. The Exchange believes it is 
reasonable to continue to provide 
credits for adding liquidity and fees for 
removing liquidity, in general, and 
higher credits for Retail Orders that 
provide liquidity and lower fees for 
removing liquidity if an ETP Holder 
meets the requirement for the proposed 
pricing tier. 
Further, given the competitive market 
for attracting Retail Orders, the 
Exchange notes that with this proposed 
rule change, the Exchange’s pricing for 
Retail Orders would be comparable to 
credits currently in place on other 
exchanges that the Exchange competes 
with for order flow. For example, 
MEMX LLC (‘‘MEMX’’) provides its 
members with a credit of $0.0037 per 
share if the member has a Retail Order 
ADAV equal to or greater than 0.20% of 
the TCV, or if the member has a Retail 
Order ADAV equal to or greater than 
1,000,000 share in the Pre-Market 
Session and/or Post-Market Session.
17
 
Additionally, MIAX PEARL, LLC 
(‘‘MIAX’’) provides is member with a 
credit of $0.0037 per share for Retail 
Orders that add liquidity to that 
market.
18
 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
change is also reasonable because it is 
designed to attract higher volumes of 
Retail Orders transacted on the 
Exchange by ETP Holders which would 
benefit all market participants. 
Retail Step-Up Tier 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change to eliminate the 
Retail Step-Up Tier and footnote (e) 
from the Retail Tiers pricing table is 
reasonable because each of the pricing 
tiers proposed for deletion in this 
proposed rule change have become 
underutilized. The Exchange believes it 
is reasonable to eliminate requirements 
as well as fees and credits, and even 
entire pricing tiers, when such 
incentives fail to accomplish their stated 
goal of incentivizing ETP Holders to 
direct their orders to the Exchange. The 
Exchange believes eliminating 
underutilized incentive programs would 
also simplify the Fee Schedule. The 
Exchange further believes that removing 
reference to the pricing tiers that the 
Exchange proposes to eliminate from 
the Fee Schedule would also add clarity 
to the Fee Schedule. 
Retail Order Rates 
The Exchange believes it is reasonable 
to adopt an alternative volume 
threshold for the fees offered to ETP 
Holders executing Retail Orders. The 
Exchange believes that the new 
requirement will encourage increased 
participation from retail liquidity 
providers while maintaining a 
competitive and performance-based 
pricing structure that better reflects 
current market conditions and trading 
volumes. The Exchange believes the 
proposed fee change would continue to 
encourage increased participation from 
retail liquidity providers by providing 
greater flexibility and clarity as to what 
fee or rebate level would be applicable 
to any submitted order at the time of 
execution, thereby removing 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system. In 
general, the Exchange believes this 
proposed alternative threshold would 
result in lower fees for qualifying ETP 
Holders when trading volumes are 
higher or in months when there are 
more than 20 trading days. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
change is also reasonable because it is 
designed to attract higher volumes of 
Retail Orders transacted on the 
Exchange by ETP Holders which would 
benefit all market participants by 
offering greater price discovery, 
increased transparency, and an 
increased opportunity to trade on the 
Exchange. The Exchange believes that 
the proposal represents a reasonable 
effort to provide enhanced order 
execution opportunities for ETP 
Holders. All ETP Holders would benefit 
from the greater amounts of liquidity on 
the Exchange, which would represent a 
wider range of execution opportunities. 
The Exchange notes that market 
participants are free to shift their order 
flow to competing venues if they believe 
other markets offer more favorable fees 
and credits. On the backdrop of the 
competitive environment in which the 
Exchange currently operates, the 
proposed rule change is a reasonable 
attempt to increase liquidity on the 
Exchange. 
The Proposed Fee Change Is an 
Equitable Allocation of Fees and Credits 
The Exchange believes the proposal 
equitably allocates fees and credits 
among market participants because all 
ETP Holders that participate on the 
Exchange would be subject to the 
proposed rule change on an equal basis. 
Retail Tier 5 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change to adopt new 
Retail Tier 5 equitably allocates fees and 
credits among its market participants 
because it is reasonably related to the 
value of the Exchange’s market quality 
associated with higher volume in Retail 
Orders. The Exchange believes that 
pricing is just one of the factors that ETP 
Holders consider when determining 
where to direct their order flow. Among 
other things, factors such as execution 
quality, fill rates, and volatility, are 
important and deterministic to ETP 
Holders in deciding where to send their 
order flow. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed adoption of Retail Tier 5 is 
equitable because the magnitude of the 
proposed credit is not unreasonably 
high relative to credits paid by other 
exchanges for orders that provide 
additional liquidity in Retail Orders.
19
 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change would improve market 
quality for all market participants on the 
Exchange and, as a consequence, attract 
more Retail Orders to the Exchange, 
thereby improving market-wide quality 
and price discovery. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change equitably 
allocates its fees and credits because 
maintaining the proportion of Retail 
Orders in exchange-listed securities that 
are executed on a registered national 
securities exchange (rather than relying 
on certain available off-exchange

execution methods) would contribute to 
investors’ confidence in the fairness of 
their transactions and would benefit all 
investors by deepening the Exchange’s 
liquidity pool, supporting the quality of 
price discovery, promoting market 
transparency and improving investor 
protection. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposal is equitable because all ETP 
Holders would be subject to the same 
fee structure. Moreover, the proposed 
alternative requirement to qualify for 
the proposed new pricing tier would be 
available to all ETP Holders to satisfy, 
including ETP Holders that are affiliated 
with an NYSE Arca Options OTP Holder 
or OTP Firm. ETP Holders that are not 
affiliated with an NYSE Arca Options 
OTP Holder or OTP Firm would still be 
eligible for fees and credits by means 
other than the proposed Retail Tier 5. 
Nasdaq similarly charges certain fees 
based on both equity and options 
volume.
20
 
Retail Step-Up Tier 
The Exchange believes that 
eliminating requirements as well as fees 
and credits, and even entire pricing 
tiers, from the Fee Schedule when such 
incentives become ineffective is 
equitable because the requirements, as 
well as fees and credits, and even entire 
pricing tiers, would be eliminated in 
their entirety and would no longer be 
available to any ETP Holder. All ETP 
Holders would continue to be subject to 
the same fee structure, and access to the 
Exchange’s market would continue to be 
offered on fair and nondiscriminatory 
terms. The Exchange also believes that 
the proposed change would protect 
investors and the public interest 
because the deletion of underutilized 
pricing tiers would make the Fee 
Schedule more accessible and 
transparent and facilitate market 
participants’ understanding of the fees 
charged for services currently offered by 
the Exchange. 
Retail Order Rates 
The Exchange believes its proposal 
equitably allocates fees and credits 
among its market participants by 
fostering liquidity provision and 
stability in the marketplace. The 
Exchange believes the proposed changes 
to Retail Orders are an equitable 
allocation of fees because the proposed 
changes, taken together, will further 
incentivize ETP Holders to continue to 
direct their retail order flow to the 
Exchange. The Exchange also believes 
that the proposed rule change is 
equitable because it would apply to all 
similarly situated ETP Holders. As 
previously noted, the Exchange operates 
in a competitive environment, 
particularly as it relates to attracting 
Retail Orders to the Exchange. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change equitably 
allocates its fees and credits because 
maintaining the proportion of Retail 
Orders in exchange-listed securities that 
are executed on a registered national 
securities exchange (rather than relying 
on certain available off-exchange 
execution methods) would contribute to 
investors’ confidence in the fairness of 
their transactions and would benefit all 
investors by deepening the Exchange’s 
liquidity pool, supporting the quality of 
price discovery, promoting market 
transparency and improving investor 
protection. 
The Proposed Fee Change Is Not 
Unfairly Discriminatory 
Retail Tier 5 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change to adopt proposed 
new Retail Tier 5 is not unfairly 
discriminatory. In the prevailing 
competitive environment, ETP Holders 
are free to disfavor the Exchange’s 
pricing if they believe that alternatives 
offer them better value. Moreover, the 
proposal neither targets nor will it have 
a disparate impact on any particular 
category of market participant. The 
Exchange believes that the proposal 
does not permit unfair discrimination 
because the proposal would be applied 
to all similarly situated ETP Holders 
and all ETP Holders would be similarly 
subject to the proposed volume 
requirement to qualify for the proposed 
new Retail Tier 5. Accordingly, no ETP 
Holder already operating on the 
Exchange would be disadvantaged by 
the proposed allocation of fees. The 
Exchange further believes that the 
proposed change would not permit 
unfair discrimination among ETP 
Holders because the general and tiered 
rates are available equally to all ETP 
Holders. 
As described above, in today’s 
competitive marketplace, order flow 
providers have a choice of where to 
direct order flow, and the Exchange 
believes the proposed adoption of an 
increased credit under the proposed 
new pricing tier will incentivize greater 
number of ETP Holders to direct their 
order flow to the Exchange. Lastly, the 
submission of Retail Orders is optional 
for ETP Holders in that they could 
choose whether to submit Retail Orders 
and, if they do, the extent of its activity 
in this regard. 
Retail Step Up Tier 
The Exchange believes that 
eliminating requirements as well as fees 
and credits, and even entire pricing 
tiers, from the Fee Schedule when such 
incentives become ineffective is not 
unfairly discriminatory because the 
requirements, as well as fees and 
credits, and even entire pricing tiers, 
would be eliminated in their entirety 
and would no longer be available to any 
ETP Holder. All ETP Holders would 
continue to be subject to the same fee 
structure, and access to the Exchange’s 
market would continue to be offered on 
fair and nondiscriminatory terms. The 
Exchange also believes that the 
proposed change would protect 
investors and the public interest 
because the deletion of underutilized 
pricing tiers would make the Fee 
Schedule more accessible and 
transparent and facilitate market 
participants’ understanding of the fees 
charged for services currently offered by 
the Exchange. 
Retail Order Rates 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change is not unfairly 
discriminatory. In the prevailing 
competitive environment, ETP Holders 
are free to disfavor the Exchange’s 
pricing if they believe that alternatives 
offer them better value. Moreover, the 
proposal neither targets nor will it have 
a disparate impact on any particular 
category of market participant. The 
Exchange believes that the proposal 
does not permit unfair discrimination 
because the proposal would be applied 
to all similarly situated ETP Holders 
and all ETP Holders would be similarly 
subject to the proposed changes. The 
Exchange further believes that the 
proposed change would not permit 
unfair discrimination among ETP 
Holders because the general and tiered 
rates are available equally to all ETP 
Holders. As described above, in today’s 
competitive marketplace, order flow 
providers have a choice of where to 
direct liquidity-providing order flow, in 
particular, Retail Orders. The Exchange 
notes that the submission of Retail 
Orders is optional for ETP Holders in 
that they could choose whether to 
submit Retail Orders and, if they do, the 
extent of its activity in this regard. 
For the foregoing reasons, the 
Exchange believes that the proposal is 
consistent with the Act.

In accordance with Section 6(b)(8) of 
the Act,
21
the Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change would not impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. Instead, as 
discussed above, the Exchange believes 
that the proposed changes would 
encourage the submission of additional 
liquidity to a public exchange, thereby 
promoting market depth, price 
discovery and transparency and 
enhancing order execution 
opportunities for ETP Holders. As a 
result, the Exchange believes that the 
proposed change furthers the 
Commission’s goal in adopting 
Regulation NMS of fostering integrated 
competition among orders, which 
promotes ‘‘more efficient pricing of 
individual stocks for all types of orders,

necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. In particular, 
the proposed change to adopt a new 
pricing tier would apply to all ETP 
Holders equally in that all ETP Holders 
would be eligible for the proposed 
pricing tier, have a reasonable 
opportunity to meet the proposed 
pricing tier’s criteria and would all 
receive the proposed rebate if such 
criteria are met. In addition, the 
proposed change to adopt an alternative 
volume threshold for the fees offered to 
ETP Holders executing Retail Orders 
would not impose any burden on 
intramarket competition. The Exchange 
believes that the new requirement will 
encourage increased participation from 
retail liquidity providers while 
maintaining a competitive and 
performance-based pricing structure 
that better reflects current market 
conditions and trading volumes. The 
Exchange does not believe that the 
proposed changes represent a significant 
departure from previous pricing offered 
by the Exchange or its competitors. The 
proposed changes are designed to attract 
additional retail order flow to the 
Exchange. Greater overall order flow, 
trading opportunities, and pricing 
transparency would benefit all market 
participants on the Exchange by 
enhancing market quality and would 
continue to encourage ETP Holders to 
send their orders to the Exchange, 
thereby contributing towards a robust 
and well-balanced market ecosystem. 
The Exchange’s proposal to eliminate 
requirements as well as fees and credits, 
and pricing tiers in their entirety, will 
not place any undue burden on 
intramarket competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. To the extent 
the proposed rule change places a 
burden on competition, any such 
burden would be outweighed by the fact 
that each of the pricing tiers proposed 
for deletion have begun to be 
underutilized by ETP Holders. 
Intermarket Competition. The 
Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change does not impose any burden on 
intermarket competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
Exchange operates in a highly 
competitive market in which market 
participants can readily choose to send 
their orders to other exchanges and off- 
exchange venues if they deem fee levels 
at those other venues to be more 
favorable. As noted above, the 
Exchange’s market share of intraday 
trading (i.e., excluding auctions) is currently less than 12%. In such an 
environment, the Exchange must 
continually adjust its fees and rebates to 
remain competitive with other 
exchanges and with off-exchange 
venues. Because competitors are free to 
modify their own fees and credits in 
response, and because market 
participants may readily adjust their 
order routing practices, the Exchange 
does not believe this proposed fee 
change would impose any burden on 
intermarket competition. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed change could promote 
competition between the Exchange and 
other execution venues, including those 
that currently offer similar order types 
and comparable transaction pricing, by 
encouraging additional orders to be sent 
to the Exchange for execution

1. Application for Child’s Insurance 
Benefits—20 CFR 404.350–404.368, 
404.603, & 416.350—0960–0010. Title II 
of the Social Security Act (Act) provides 
for the payment of monthly benefits to 
children of an insured worker who is 
retired, disabled, or deceased. Section 
202(d) of the Act discloses the 
conditions and requirements SSA 
requires the applicant to meet when 
filing an application. SSA uses the 
information provided by applicants on 
Form SSA–4–BK to determine 
entitlement for children of living and 
deceased workers to monthly Social 
Security payments. The respondents are 
guardians completing the form on behalf 
of the children of retired, living or 
deceased workers. 
Note: We are making a minor revision by adding ‘‘or adoptive’’ to question #4 to clarify 
that adoptive children also may qualify to 
receive benefits. In addition, we are updating 
the Privacy Act Statement on this form to 
comply with current legal requirements. 
Type of Request: Revision of an OMB- 
approved information collection.

tion data. This figure reflects both data from our systems and the data posted on our public facing website (800 number performance  SSA) on the date we drafted this notice. As the figures fluctuate daily, the wait times may be different on the publication date of this notice. We note that we combined these two figures for the 
purposes of this information collection, as SSA does not track whether the respondents who complete the MCS interview do so via telephone or in person. In addi-
tion, we did not calculate wait time for the respondents who use the paper form, as they submit the forms via mail. 
*** This figure does not represent actual costs that SSA is imposing on recipients of Social Security payments to complete this application; rather, these are theo-
retical opportunity costs for the additional time respondents will spend to complete the application. There is no actual charge to respondents to complete the 
application. 
2. Help America Vote Act—0960– 
0706. Public Law 107–252, the Help America Vote Act of 2002, mandates 
that States verify the identities of newly 
registered voters. When newly 
registered voters do not have driver’s 
licenses or State-issued ID cards, they 
must supply the last four digits of their 
Social Security number to their local 
State election agencies for verification. 
The election agencies forward this 
information to their State Motor Vehicle 
Administration (MVA), and the State 
MVA inputs the data into the American 
Association of MVAs (AAMVA), a 
central consolidation system that routes 
the voter data to SSA’s Help America 
Vote Verification (HAVV) system. SSA’s 
HAVV system returns the result (a 
‘‘match’’ or ‘‘no match’’ of name, DOB, 
and last four digits of an SSN) to the 
AAMVA hub, which then routes the 
information back to the state MVA. The 
respondents are the State MVAs seeking 
to confirm voter identities. 
Note: We are updating the Privacy Act Statement. 
Type of Request: Revision of an OMB- 
approved information collection.

The 45 respondents here represent the number of states participating in HAVV. SSA has agreements with forty-four states and one territory (Puerto Rico) for the 
use of HAVV to support their states’ voter registration process. Five States (i.e. New Mexico, Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia) are permitted to use the 9-digit SSN on applications for voter registration; therefore, these States do not obtain SSN verifications from SSA through HAVV for voter registration (which re-
quires states to use on the last four digits of the SSN for verification). North Dakota has no voter registration requirement and, therefore, does not use the HAVV sys-
tem. 
* We based this figure on the average Information and Record Clerks, as reported by Bureau of Labor Statistics data (Occupational Employment and Wage Statis-
tics). 
** This figure does not represent actual costs that SSA is imposing on recipients of Social Security payments to complete this application; rather, these are theo-
retical opportunity costs for the additional time respondents will spend to complete the application. There is no actual charge to respondents to complete the

Cost Burden: Per our current 
management information data, the 45 
state MVAs participating in HAVA each 
pay an annual maintenance cost of 
$1,344.88. Additionally, states pay .30 
per verification request. Therefore, the 
total annual cost to respondents is 
$60,520. 
II. SSA submitted the information 
collections below to OMB for clearance. 
Your comments regarding these 
information collections would be most 
useful if OMB and SSA receive them 30 
days from the date of this publication. 
To be sure we consider your comments, 
we must receive them no later than 
January 16, 2026. Individuals can obtain 
copies of these OMB clearance packages 
by writing to the 
OR.Reports.Clearance@ssa.gov. 
1. Report to United States Social 
Security Administration by Person 
Receiving Benefits for a Child or for an 
Adult Unable to Handle Funds/Report 
to the United States Social Security 
Administration—0960–0049. Section 203(c) of the Act requires the 
Commissioner of SSA to make benefit 
deductions and provides for the 
Commissioner to impose penalty 
deductions on benefits of individuals 
who fail to make timely reports of 
events, which are cause for deductions. 
SSA uses Forms SSA–7161–OCR–SM 
and SSA–7162–OCR–SM to: (1) 
determine continuing entitlement to 
Social Security benefits; (2) correct 
benefit amounts for beneficiaries 
outside the United States; and (3) 
monitor the performance of 
representative payees outside the 
United States (U.S.). This collection is 
mandatory as an annual (or every other 
year, depending on the country of 
residence) review for fraud prevention. 
In addition, the results can affect 
benefits by increasing or decreasing 
payment amount or by causing SSA to 
suspend or terminate benefits. The 
respondents are individuals living 
outside the United States who are 
receiving benefits on their own (or on 
behalf of someone else) under Title II of 
the Act. 
Note: SSA is making minor instructional changes to these forms in accordance with 
Public Law 115–165 which exempts certain 
representative payees from the annual 
accounting requirement. We are also 
updating the Privacy Act Statement on these 
forms to comply with current legal 
requirements.

2. Application for a Social Security 
Number (SSN) Card, the Social Security 
Number Application Process (SSNAP), 
and Online SSN Application Process 
(oSSNAP)—20 CFR 422.103–422.110— 
0960–0066. SSA collects information on the SS–5 (used in the U.S.) and SS–5– 
FS (used outside the U.S.) to issue 
original or replacement Social Security 
cards. SSA also enters the application 
data into the SSNAP application when 
issuing a card via telephone or in 
person. In addition, hospitals collect the 
same information on SSA’s behalf for 
newborn children through the 
Enumeration at Birth (EAB) process. In 
this process, parents of newborns 
provide hospital birth registration clerks 
with information required to register 
these newborns. Hospitals send this 
information to State Bureaus of Vital 
Statistics (BVS), and they send the 
information to SSA’s National Computer 
Center. SSA then uploads the data to the 
SSA mainframe along with all other 
enumeration data, and we assign the 
newborn a SSN and issue a Social 
Security card. The vast majority of 
applications for original SSN cards 
utilize EAB. Finally, oSSNAP collects 
information similar to that which we 
collect on the paper SS–5 for no change 
situations, with the exception of name 
change, new or replacement SSN cards 
for U.S. Citizens (adult and minor 
children), and replacement cards only 
for non-U.S. citizens. For certain 
applicants for SSN replacement cards, 
the modality allows respondents to 
complete the application using an 
internet application and submit the 
required evidence online rather than 
completing a paper Form SS–5 
[formerly the internet SSN Replacement 
Card (iSSNRC) application]. oSSNAP 
also allows applicants for new or 
replacement SSN cards to start the 
application process online, receive a list 
of evidentiary documents, and then 
submit the application data to SSA for 
further processing by SSA employees. 
Applicants using oSSNAP in this way 
then visit a local SSA office to complete 
the application process. 
SSA collects race and ethnicity 
information as part of the SSN card 
application process. Response to the

described above. 
Note: SSA is combining the iSSNRC and oSSNAP screens to streamline these 
processes for the respondents. Through 
combining the screens under one application 
(oSSNAP), respondents can more easily find 
the electronic process which works best for 
them to submit their request for a 
replacement SSN card.

on disability to determine if their 
disability continues. SSA considers 
adults eligible for disability payments if 
they continue to be unable to do 
substantial gainful activity because of 
their impairments, and we consider 
Title XVI children eligible for disability 
payment if they have marked and severe 
functional limitations because of their 
impairments. To assess claimants’ 
ongoing disability payment eligibility, 
SSA uses the information gathered 
through the Continuing Disability 
Review Report to complete a mandatory 
review for the continue disability 
review (CDR). 
SSA also uses the Continuing 
Disability Review Report to obtain 
information on sources of medical 
treatment; participation in vocational 
rehabilitation programs (if any); 
attempts to work (if any); and recipients’ 
assessments when they believe their 
conditions improved. Title II or Title 
XVI disability recipients can complete 
the Continuing Disability Review Report 
using one of three modalities: 
(1) a paper application or fillable PDF 
(using Form SSA–454–BK); (2) a field 
office interview, during which SSA 
employees enter claimant’s data directly 
into the Electronic Disability Collection 
System (EDCS); or (3) using an online 
system (i454), which is a web-based 
modality that provides recipients a fully 
electronic platform for submitting 
information to increase accessibility and 
enhance automation. When SSA 
initiates a medical CDR, we send a 
mailed notice to the individual with a 
disability informing that individual that 
SSA requires a CDR. The mailed notice 
provides instructions to the recipient on 
how to assist the agency with initiating 
the CDR and gives the individual the 
option to complete a paper SSA–454 or 
an i454 for adult only disabled 
individuals. When an individual 
requires a CDR, a claims specialist (CS) 
mails the paper Form SSA–454–BK, and 
the respondent completes the form, and 
sends or brings it back to SSA; or the CS 
interviews the respondent and enters 
the information into the appropriate 
EDCS screens; or adult disabled 
individuals submit the information 
electronically using the i454 internet 
application. Regardless of the modality 
the respondent uses to complete the 
information (paper, EDCS, or internet 
versions), SSA electronically stores the 
information provided in EDCS. The 
respondents complete the SSA–454–BK 
by themselves with self-help 
information available, or a 
representative may complete the paper 
form or electronic application on their 
behalf. The respondents are Title II or 
Title XVI disability recipients or their 
representatives. 
Note: We are revising the burden for this information collection, making minor 
revisions to the language for clarification 
purposes, and updating the Privacy Act 
Statement to comply with current legal 
requirements.

4. Certificate of Coverage Request—20 
CFR 404.1913—0960–0554. The U.S, 
has agreements with 30 foreign 
countries to eliminate double Social 
Security coverage and taxation where, 
except for the provisions of the 
agreement, a worker would be subject to 
coverage and taxes in both countries. 
Each Agreement contains rules: (1) for 
determining which country’s laws cover 
the period of work, and to which system 
the worker pays taxes; and (2) that 
assign a worker’s coverage to the 
country where the worker has the 
greater economic attachment. The 
agreements further dictate that, upon 
the request of the worker or employer, 
the country under whose system the 
period of work is covered will issue a 
certificate of coverage. The certificate 
serves as proof of exemption from 
coverage and taxation under the system 
of the other country. The information 
we collect assists us in determining a 
worker’s coverage and in issuing a U.S. 
certificate of coverage as appropriate. 
Per our agreements, we ask a set number 
of questions to the workers and 
employers prior to issuing a certificate 
of coverage; however, our agreements 
with thirteen of the countries (Denmark, 
Iceland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, 
Germany, Italy, Spain, Uraguay, 
Belgium, Poland, France, and Japan) 
require us to ask a few more questions 
in those countries. Respondents are 
workers and employers wishing to 
establish exemption from foreign Social 
Security taxes. 
Note: SSA is updating the Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Statements on 
these forms to comply with current legal 
requirements.

approved information collection.

We are including a one-hour placeholder burden for the information collection for which we currently have no responses (mostly the mailed/faxed letters, as we do 
not receive these often, since we collect almost all responses via our internet-based forms). While respondents may use this modality if the system goes down, in 
general, they prefer to use the internet submission process. 
* We based this figure on average U.S. citizen’s hourly salary, as reported by Bureau of Labor Statistics data (Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics). 
** This figure does not represent actual costs that SSA is imposing on recipients of Social Security payments to complete this application; rather, these are theo-
retical opportunity costs for the additional time respondents will spend to complete the application. There is no actual charge to respondents to complete the 
application. 
5. Disability Report–Child—20 CFR 
416.912—0960–0577. Sections 
223(d)(5)(A) and 1631(e)(1) of the Act 
require Supplemental Security Income 
(SSI) claimants to furnish medical and 
other evidence to prove they are 
disabled. SSA uses Form SSA–3820–BK 
to collect information regarding a child 
applying for SSI disability payments. 
The information we collect on the SSA– 
3820–BK then provides the State 
Disability Determination Services (DDS) 
adjudicators a detailed explanation of a 
child’s medical history that is essential 
to the disability determination. SSA 
uses Form SSA–3820–BK to collect 
contact and biographic information 
about a child. It also includes details 
pertaining to the child’s condition 
including medical treating sources, 
medications being taken, medical tests, 
educational background, and work 
history if relevant. The State (DDS) 
evaluators use the information from 
Form SSA–3820–BK, including its 
electronic versions, to request and 
develop medical and school evidence, 
and to assess the alleged disability. The 
information collected on the form, 
together with medical evidence and 
other sources of non-medical evidence, 
provides the evidentiary basis upon 
which SSA makes its initial disability 
evaluation. The respondents are the 
responsible adult(s) applying on behalf 
of the child, such as the parents, 
guardians, and other caretakers who 
petition SSI childhood disability for 
initial and reconsideration decisions. 
Note: SSA is updating the Privacy Act and Paperwork Reduction Act Statements on 
these forms to comply with current legal 
requirements.

6. Consent Based Social Security 
Number Verification Process—20 CFR 
400.100—0960–0760. The Consent 
Based Social Security Number 
Verification (CBSV) process is a fee- 
based automated Social Security 
number (SSN) verification service 
available to private businesses and other 
requesting parties. To use the system, 
private businesses and requesting 
parties must register with SSA and 
obtain valid consent from SSN holders 
prior to verification. We collect the 
information to verify if the submitted 
name and SSN match the information in 
SSA records. After completing a 
registration process and paying the fee, 
the requesting party can use the CBSV 
process to submit a file containing the 
names of number holders who gave 
valid consent, along with each number 
holder’s accompanying SSN and date of 
birth (if available) to obtain real-time 
results using a web service application 
or SSA’s Business Services Online 
(BSO) application. SSA matches the 
information against the SSA master file 
of SSNs, using SSN, name, date of birth, 
and gender code (if available). The 
requesting party retrieves the results file 
from SSA, which indicates only a match 
or no match for each SSN submitted. 
Under the CBSV process, the 
requesting party does not submit the 
consent forms of the number holders to 
SSA. SSA requires each requesting party 
to retain a valid consent form for each 
SSN verification request. The requesting 
party retains the consent forms in either 
electronic or paper format. 
SSA added a strong audit component 
to ensure the integrity of the CBSV 
process. At the discretion of the agency, 
we require audits (called ‘‘compliance 
reviews’’) with the requesting party 
paying all audit costs. Independent 
certified public accounts (CPAs) 
conduct these reviews to ensure 
compliance with all the terms and 
conditions of the party’s agreement with 
SSA, including a review of the consent 
forms. CPAs conduct the reviews at the 
requesting party’s place of business to 
ensure the integrity of the process. In 
addition, SSA reserves the right to 
perform unannounced onsite 
inspections of the entire process, 
including review of the technical 
systems that maintain the data and 
transaction records. The respondents to 
the CBSV collection are the 
participating companies; members of 
the public who consent to the SSN 
verification; and CPAs who provide 
compliance review services. 
Note: We are revising the burden for this information collection.

approved information collection.

7. Statement for Determining 
Continuing Entitlement for Special 
Veterans Benefits (SVB)—0960–0782. 
Title VIII of the Act provides for the 
payment of Special Veterans benefits 
(SVB) to certain World War II veterans 
who reside outside of the United States. 
SSA regularly reviews individuals’ 
claims for SVB to determine their 
continued eligibility and correct 
payment amounts. SSA requires 
individuals living outside the United 
States receiving SVB to report any 
changes to SSA that may affect their 
benefits. These include changes such as: 
(1) a change in mailing address or 
residence; (2) an increase or decrease in 
a pension, annuity, or other recurring 
benefit; (3) a return or visit to the United 
States for a calendar month or longer; or 
(4) an inability to manage benefits. SSA 
uses Form SSA–2010–F6, to collect this 
information. All beneficiaries have face- 
to-face interviews with the Federal 
Benefits Unit (FBU) every year who 
assist them in completing this form. 
Respondents are SVB beneficiaries 
living outside the United States. 
This is a correction notice: SSA 
published the incorrect burden 
information for this collection at 90 FR

Abstract of Proposed Collection 
Forms DS–1843 and DS–1622 collect 
medical history, screenings and 
physical examinations for all 
individuals applying for overseas 
positions, including their eligible family 
members. Forms DS–1843 and DS–1622 
are designed to collect sufficient and 
current medical information on the 
individual for a medical provider to 
make a medical clearance determination 
for initial appointment to an overseas 
assignment. They are also used to 
determine whether the individual or 
eligible family member will have 
appropriate medical and/or educational 
resources at a diplomatic mission/host 
country abroad to maintain the health 
and safety of the individual or family 
member. The forms were updated to 
include questions regarding 
employment agency information for 
non-foreign service agencies. 
Methodology 
The respondent will initially answer 
the questions on pages 1–3 of the forms 
digitally. They will then be prompted to 
download the auto populated form with 
their responses and take it to their 
personal medical provider for 
completion and authorization of pages 
4–5. Once complete, the forms will be 
submitted via a secure online platform 
for review by the Office of Medical 
Clearances.

Foreign Terrorist Organization 
Designation of Clan del Golfo 
Based upon a review of the 
Administrative Record assembled in 
this matter, and in consultation with the 
Attorney General and the Secretary of 
the Treasury, I have concluded that 
there is a sufficient factual basis to find 
that the relevant circumstances 
described in section 219 of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act, as 
amended (hereinafter ‘‘INA’’) (8 U.S.C. 
1189), exist with respect to: Clan del 
Golfo (also known as Banda Criminal de 
Uraba, Los Autodefensas Gaitanistas de 
Colombia, Clan Usuga, Los Urabenos, 
Gulf Clan). 
Therefore, I hereby designate the 
aforementioned organization and its 
respective aliases as a Foreign Terrorist 
Organization pursuant to section 219 of 
the INA. 
This determination shall be published 
in the Federal Register. This 
designation goes into effect upon 
publication.

Acting under the authority of and in 
accordance with section 1(a)(ii)(A) of 
Executive Order 13224, as amended 
(‘‘E.O. 13224’’ or ‘‘Order’’), I hereby 
determine that the person known as 
Clan del Golfo (also known as Banda 
Criminal de Uraba, Los Autodefensas 
Gaitanistas de Colombia, Clan Usuga, 
Los Urabenos, Gulf Clan) is a foreign 
person who has committed or has 
attempted to commit, poses a significant 
risk of committing, or has participated 
in training to commit acts of terrorism 
that threaten the security of U.S. 
nationals or the national security, 
foreign policy, or economy of the United 
States. 
Consistent with the determination in 
section 10 of E.O. 13224 that prior 
notice to persons determined to be 
subject to the Order who might have a 
constitutional presence in the United 
States would render ineffectual the 
blocking and other measures authorized 
in the Order because of the ability to 
transfer funds instantaneously, I 
determine that no prior notice needs to 
be provided to any person subject to this 
determination who might have a 
constitutional presence in the United

ineffectual the measures authorized in

DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION 
Federal Aviation Administration 
Proposed Permanent Closure of 
Mason County Airport, Point Pleasant, 
West Virginia 
AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. 
ACTION: Notice of request for comment on the proposed permanent closure of 
Mason County Airport, Point Pleasant, 
West Virginia. 
SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to rule and invites public comment on Mason 
County’s request to permanently close 
Mason County Airport, West Virginia. 
The permanent closure of Mason 
County Airport involves the FAA’s 
release of the federally obligated airport 
property from all federal obligations 
enabling the disposal of the entirety of 
the 125.56 acres of airport property. 
Most of the airport property was 
acquired with federal financial 
assistance via Federal Aid-Airport 
Program Grant 9–46–016–C902 and the 
remaining acreage was acquired from 
the General Services Administration. 
Given the negligible aeronautical use of 
the airport, the fact that is located in 
close proximity to other federally 
obligated airports, and the fact that the 
sales proceeds of the airport will be 
provided to a nearby federally obligated 
airport with superior facilities, it is 
anticipated that the closure of Mason 
County Airport will result in a net 
benefit to civil aviation. 
DATES: Comments must be received on or before January 26, 2026. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Comments on this application may be 
mailed or delivered to the following 
address: 
Rick L. Handley, President, Mason 
County Commission, 200 Sixth Street 
Suite 2, Point Pleasant, WV 25550,

Matthew Di Giulian, Manager, Beckley 
Airports Field Office, 176 Airport 
Circle, Room 101, Beaver, WV 25183, 
(609) 916–5794 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with the Wendell H. Ford 
Aviation Investment and Reform Act for 
the 21st Century (AIR 21), Public Law 
106–181 (Apr. 5, 2000; 114 Stat. 61), 
this notice must be published in the 
Federal Register 30 days before the 
Secretary may waive any condition on 
federally acquired land on a federally 
obligated airport. The following is a 
brief overview of the request. 
Mason County has submitted a 
request seeking FAA approval for the 
permanent closure of Mason County 
Airport, Point Pleasant, West Virginia 
including the FAA’s release of the 
airport from all federal obligations, to 
allow for the disposal of the entire 
125.56 acres of federally obligated 
airport property. Most of the airport 
property was acquired via Grant No. 9– 
46–016–C902, executed in 1969, 
through which the FAA provided 50% 
of the cost of the acquisition of 124.28 
acres of property. The remaining 1.28 
acres was acquired from the General 
Services Administration (GSA) in 1967. 
Mason County Airport has low 
numbers of both based aircraft and 
annual operations, as well as, timeworn 
and deteriorating facilities. 
Additionally, the airport is located in 
fairly close proximity to two other 
federally obligated airports (Gallia 
Meigs Airport, Gallipolis, Ohio and 
Jackson County Airport, Millwood, West 
Virginia). As a condition of the FAA’s 
release of Mason County from all federal 
obligations the proceeds of the sale of 
the airport property, as well as the 
unamortized portion of a grant received 
by Mason County for the airport in 
2015, will be provided to Jackson 
County Airport. The owner of Jackson 
County Airport has agreed to use the 
proceeds of the sale in a manner 
approved by the Federal Aviation 
Administration with the goal of 
accommodating the former users of 
Mason County Airport. It is anticipated 
that the former users of Mason County 
Airport will be able to take advantage of 
Jackson County Airport’s superior 
facilities and aeronautical services, 
compared to Mason County Airport, 
including Jackson County Airport’s full- 
length parallel taxiway, fuel services, 
flight instruction, and a newly built 
terminal. The West Virginia Department 
of Transportation’s Division of 
Multimodal Transportation Systems has 
indicated that it supports the proposed 
release and closure. 
Issued in Beckley, West Virgina.

renewed (49 CFR 381.300(b)). 
III. Applicant’s Request 
Current Regulatory Requirements 
Under 49 CFR 395.3(a)(2), drivers of 
property-carrying CMVs are prohibited 
from driving after a period of 14 
consecutive hours after coming on duty 
following 10 consecutive hours off duty. 
Under 49 CFR 395.3(b)(1), such 
drivers are prohibited from operating a 
CMV for any period after having been 
on duty 60 hours in any period of 7 
consecutive days if the employing motor 
carrier does not operate CMVs every day 
of the week. 
Under 49 CFR 395.3(b)(2), such 
drivers are prohibited from operating a 
CMV for any period after having been 
on duty 70 hours in any period of 8 
consecutive days if the employing motor 
carrier does operate CMVs every day of 
the week. 
Applicant’s Request 
Hulcher is a nationwide emergency 
response provider to the railroad 
industry, with 27 strategically placed 
divisions and a workforce trained to 
rapidly mobilize equipment and 
personnel to address derailments, 
natural disasters, and other critical 
disruptions to rail infrastructure. 
Hulcher drivers transport heavy 
recovery equipment such as side-booms, 
grapple trucks, rollbacks, service trucks, 
and other CMVs needed to restore 
normal rail operations following a 
derailment or related incident. 
Hulcher requests the same exemption 
that FMCSA granted to R.J Corman and 
Cranemasters, Inc., et al. (RJ Corman) 
[85 FR 12818, Mar. 4, 2020]. That 
exemption was renewed on July 24, 
2025 [90 FR 34956]. Both the 2020 
decision and the 2025 decision have 
been included in the docket for this 
exemption request. Hulcher believes it 
performs the same essential services to 
the railroad industry and the public as 
RJ Corman. The requested exemption 
would apply to Hulcher’s fleet of CMVs 
and approximately 350 driver 
employees. Hulcher requests relief from 
the HOS requirements in 49 CFR part 
395 when a driver is dispatched in 
response to a railroad’s request to assist 
in clearing disabled or derailed trains, 
debris, or hazards that block railroad 
rights-of-way. According to Hulcher, 
unplanned events requiring response 
frequently occur outside normal 
business hours, including late night and 
early morning callouts, and the events 
are often in remote areas where no 
Federal or State emergency declaration 
has been issued. According to the 
applicant, ‘‘without the exemption 
drivers will not be able to transport 
equipment due to exceeding the 14-hour 
driving ‘‘window’’ or 70-hour weekly 
limits, despite being the only qualified 
operators available.’’ 
Applicant’s Equivalent Level of Safety 
Hulcher believes the exemption 
would not compromise safety, as the 
company claims to maintain a 
documented fatigue management policy, 
enforce pre-dispatch rest periods, and 
equip each Division with on-site 
supervisors to monitor driver alertness. 
Hulcher states that its drivers never 
return to a home terminal or operate 
CMVs post-restoration of rail service 
without receiving the required off-duty 
hours under the Federal HOS rules. 
Hulcher further implements the 
following measures to mitigate fatigue 
and risk during emergency responses: 
(1) all drivers receive a minimum one- 
hour lead time prior to mobilization; (2) 
field supervisors conduct verbal 
readiness checks and ensure vehicle 
inspections prior to dispatch; and (3) 
drivers are explicitly authorized to 
decline driving assignments if fatigued, 
and backup operators are dispatched 
when necessary. Hulcher further adds 
that its drivers record all time spent at 
incident sites as on-duty (not driving) 
time, and no driver is permitted to 
operate a CMV after completing field 
work until the required 10 or 34 hours 
of off-duty rest has been satisfied. 
A copy of Hulcher’s application for 
exemption is available for review in the 
docket for this notice. 
IV. Request for Comments 
In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 
31315(b), FMCSA requests public 
comment from all interested persons on 
Hulcher’s application for an exemption 
from the HOS regulations in 49 CFR part 
395. All comments received before the 
close of business on the comment 
closing date will be considered and will 
be available for examination in the 
docket at the location listed under the 
ADDRESSESsection of this notice. 
Comments received after the comment 
closing date will be filed in the public 
docket and will be considered to the 
extent practicable. In addition to late 
comments, FMCSA will also continue to 
file, in the public docket, relevant 
information that becomes available after 
the comment closing date. Interested 
persons should continue to examine the 
public docket for new material.

Evenflo Company, Inc., Denial of 
Petition for Decision of 
Inconsequential Noncompliance 
AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 
Department of Transportation (DOT). 
ACTION: Denial of petition. SUMMARY: Evenflo Company, Inc. (Evenflo) has determined that certain 
Evenflo All4One child restraint systems 
do not fully comply with Federal Motor 
Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 
213, Child Restraint Systems. Evenflo filed a noncompliance report dated 
January 27, 2025, and subsequently 
petitioned NHTSA (the ‘‘Agency’’) on 
February 14, 2025, for a decision that 
the subject noncompliance is 
inconsequential as it relates to motor 
vehicle safety. This document 
announces the denial of Evenflo’s 
petition.

II. Child Restraint Systems Involved: 
Evenflo reported that approximately 
67,416 Evenflo All4One, manufactured 
between December 1, 2021, and June 30, 
2023, do not meet the requirements of 
FMVSS No. 213. 
III. Relevant FMVSS Requirements: 
Paragraph S5.1.1(b)(1) of FMVSS No. 
213 includes the requirements relevant 
to this petition. Paragraph S5.1.1(b)(1) 
requires that all adjustable child 
restraint systems must remain in the 
same position after testing (in 
accordance with paragraph S6.1 of 
FMVSS No. 213) to which they were set 
before testing, unless the child restraint 
system meets conditions specified in 
S5.1.1(b)(2). 
IV. Noncompliance: Evenflo explains 
that some Evenflo All4One child 
restraint systems undergoing testing 
have changed position during testing. 
V. Summary of Evenflo’s Petition: The 
following views and arguments 
presented in this section, ‘‘V. Summary 
of Evenflo’s Petition,’’ are the views and 
arguments provided by Evenflo. They 
do not reflect the views of NHTSA. 
Evenflo submits that, although the 
subject child restraints changed to a 
different adjustment position during 
rear-facing tests, the noncompliance is 
inconsequential as it relates to motor 
vehicle safety. 
Evenflo begins its submission by 
citing previously granted petitions for 
inconsequential noncompliance that it 
submits are relevant to its own petition. 
Evenflo first quotes NHTSA’s decision 
on a petition by Gillig, LLC, describing 
NHTSA’s procedures when considering 
petitions: ‘‘(i)n determining 
inconsequentiality of a noncompliance, 
NHTSA focuses on the safety risk to 
individuals who experience the type of 
event against which the recall would 
otherwise protect.’’ (see Gillig, LLC, Grant of Petition for Decision of 
Inconsequential Noncompliance, 90 FR 
735, January 6, 2025). 
Evenflo then cites two granted 
petitions for inconsequential 
noncompliance purportedly to show 
that, for FMVSS relating to occupant 
protection, NHTSA grants petitions 
when the manufacturer can show that 
the noncompliance does not subject the 
occupant to a greater risk of injury than 
the risk that would exist if the 
component or vehicle were compliant 
(see General Motors, Grant of Petition for Decision of Inconsequential 
Noncompliance, 78 FR 35355, June 12, 
2013; see also Osram Sylvania, Grant of Petition for Decision of Inconsequential 
Noncompliance, 78 FR 46000, July 30, 
2013). 
Evenflo states that the precedent of 
these decisions supports Evenflo’s 
petition for the subject noncompliance. 
Evenflo states that the subject 
noncompliant child restraint systems 
(CRSs) still meet the intended purpose 
of paragraph S5.1.1(b)(1) of FMVSS No. 
213 as they do not expose occupants 
within the CRS to a greater risk of injury 
in a crash than occupants in a compliant 
CRS. Evenflo submits a 1996 letter from 
the NHTSA Chief Council to C. Scott 
Talbot, Esq. of Howrey & Simon that 
stated that the purpose of paragraph 
S.5.1.1(b)(1) is to (1) ‘‘prevent a child’s 
fingers or limbs from being caught in 
shifting parts of the restraint’’ and (2) 
prevent the occupant from sliding from 
under the lap belt during a crash (also 
known as ‘‘submarining’’).
1
 
Evenflo states that there is no risk of 
children’s fingers or limbs being 
crushed by the moving parts because all 
shifting parts of the child restraint 
systems are located outside and below 
the seat structure and are inaccessible to 
the child occupant. Evenflo states that 
the child has no risk of submarining 
because the change in recline 
adjustment only occurred during a rear 
facing test, where submarining is 
impossible. Furthermore, Evenflo states 
that the seats come equipped with a 5- 
point harness, which functioned as 
intended during testing, preventing 
movement of the child relative to the 
seating surface. 
Additionally, Evenflo recognizes that 
NHTSA does not consider the absence 
of complaints or injuries to be relevant 
when considering the 
inconsequentiality of a noncompliance. 
However, Evenflo notes that it has not 
found any reports or complaints of a 
child’s fingers or limbs being caught in 
the shifting parts of the subject child 
restraint systems, nor have there been 
any reports of submarining caused by 
the child restraint system’s 
noncompliance with paragraph 
S5.1.1(b)(1) of FMVSS No. 213. 
Evenflo concludes by stating its belief 
that the subject noncompliance is 
inconsequential as it relates to motor 
vehicle safety and its petition to be 
exempted from providing notification of 
the noncompliance, as required by 49 
U.S.C. 30118, and a remedy for the 
noncompliance, as required by 49 
U.S.C. 30120, should be granted. 
VI. Public Comment: NHTSA received 
one comment concerning Evenflo’s 
petition, from Advocates for Highway & 
Auto Safety (AHAS). AHAS stated in 
their comment that the noncompliance 
of the subject child restraint system 
(CRS) does not appear to be equivalent 
to the other noncompliance issues cited 
in Evenflo’s petition. AHAS also stated 
that Evenflo’s petition fails to address 
that the changing recline of the subject 
CRS could lead to additional and 
injurious loading of the occupant from 
the belts and/or harness leading to 
injury. AHAS said that NHTSA should 
collect certain data from Evenflo and 
provide it to the public for review before 
determining whether the subject 
noncompliance is inconsequential to 
motor vehicle safety. Specifically, 
AHAS believes that NHTSA should 
collect the following information: 
1. Visual evidence (videos and 
photos) of the testing and 
noncompliance. 
2. Instrumentation data, including any 
readings from anthropomorphic test 
devices (ATDs). 
3. Evaluation of the injury risk to 
vulnerable occupants due to the 
modified orientation and movement 
during the testing. 
VII. NHTSA’s Analysis: The burden of 
establishing the inconsequentiality of a 
failure to comply with a performance 
requirement in an FMVSS is substantial 
and difficult to meet. Accordingly, the 
Agency has not found many such 
noncompliances inconsequential.
2
 
In determining inconsequentiality of a 
noncompliance, NHTSA focuses on the 
safety risk to individuals who 
experience the type of event against 
which a recall would otherwise 
protect.

It is also noteworthy that the 1996 interpretation 
cited the 1979 final rule highlighted that the intent 
of paragraph S5.1.1(b)(1) is to prevent child 
occupants’ fingers or limbs from being caught 
between the shifting parts of the child restraint. 
This safety intent related to change of position 
remains relevant today; however, it is worth 
highlighting that preambles and interpretations do 
not necessarily list all safety purposes of a given 
requirement.

44 FR 72131, December 13, 1979. 
they have the burden of persuading 
NHTSA that the noncompliance is 
inconsequential to safety. Granting a 
petition does not permit the 
manufacturer to continue to produce 
products that have the noncompliance. 
NHTSA has evaluated the merits of 
Evenflo’s petition and determined 
Evenflo has not met its burden of 
persuasion that the subject 
noncompliance is inconsequential to 
motor vehicle safety. 
Paragraph S5.1.1(b)(1) of FMVSS No. 
213 requires that all adjustable child 
restraint systems must remain in the 
same position after testing (in 
accordance with paragraph S6.1 of 
FMVSS No. 213) to which they were set 
before testing, unless the child restraint 
system meets conditions specified in 
S5.1.1(b)(2). Evenflo’s petition states the 
subject child restraints changed to a 
different adjustment position during 
rear-facing tests. Throughout the 
petition, Evenflo argues that the 
noncompliance is inconsequential to 
safety because the component that is 
changing position does not pose a risk 
of injury to the child occupant’s fingers 
or limbs. 
Evenflo relies on a 1996 NHTSA 
interpretation whereby NHTSA found a 
change in position of booster CRS 
shoulder belt adjustment guide during a 
crash test was permitted under 
S5.1.1(b)(1).
4
This interpretation is not 
applicable to Evenflo’s noncompliance. 
The 1996 interpretation concerns a belt- 
positioning seat that had adjustable 
devices for positioning the vehicle belt 
onto the child’s lap and shoulder. The 
interpretation states that movement of 
the belt adjuster device during a crash 
is permitted because, in part, it is not a 
structural element, such as the seating 
surface. In contrast, the interpretation 
specifically identifies movement of 
structural elements, such as 
repositioning of the reclining feature, as 
the type of movement the standard was 
aimed at preventing. This is the precise 
movement at issue in the current 
petition: a support structure failure that 
causes the reclining feature to change 
position during the test.
5
 
This change in position of the subject 
child restraint poses a risk to other 
nearby occupants whose fingers may be 
pinched, even if it does not pose a risk 
to pinching fingers of the occupant of 
the child restraint itself. NHTSA has 
closely examined the CRS in question 
and has concluded that vehicle 
occupants seated alongside the CRS are 
at a risk of having their limbs pinched 
in the opening or gap located above the 
recline indicator on the bottom of the 
CRS when the CRS changes position. 
NHTSA observed that the All4One 
changed recline position in NHTSA 
compliance testing.
6
Evenflo’s customer 
complaints and NHTSA’s Vehicle 
Owner’s Questionnaires (VOQs) 
demonstrate that the All4One has 
changed recline position during routine 
use when parents were securing their 
children into the child restraint and 
driving under normal conditions. 
NHTSA has sixteen (16) consumer 
complaints (VOQs) specifically relating 
to the change in recline position, as of 
August 20, 2025. Evenflo submits in its 
petition that it has received no reports 
of injury related to catching of the CRS 
child occupant’s fingers or limbs in the 
shifting parts. However, Evenflo 
reported four-hundred and one (401) 
consumer complaints which they 
characterized as ‘‘recline slips 
position,’’ with an additional twenty- 
five (25) complaints related to the 
All4One’s recline mechanism. Two of 
the consumer complaints produced by 
Evenflo concern finger entrapment in 
the All4One’s recline mechanism, 
demonstrating Evenflo knew of injuries 
associated with the seat changing 
position. These consumer complaints 
indicate that the Evenflo All4One is 
subject to change position simply when 
placing the child in the CRS as well as 
under normal driving conditions. 
Therefore, the noncompliance not only 
creates a safety concern during a crash, 
but the noncompliance also poses safety 
issues during other common use 
scenarios. 
In addition, the change in position 
presents safety concerns related to the 
positioning of the child occupant’s head 
and neck in the CRS. As the printed 
instructions provided with the CRS 
state: ‘‘Failure to properly recline the 
child restraint could increase the child’s 
risk of serious injury or death.’’ The 
All4One user manual instructs the user 
to recline the seat in a position that 
ensures it is in the ‘‘blue’’ zone on the 
CRS’s level indicator. Consumer 
complaints indicate that the change of 
recline position during routine use 
causes the CRS’s level indicator to move 
from the safe ‘‘blue’’ zone into a ‘‘red’’ 
zone. When the CRS is in a reclined 
position that is outside of the proper 
recline zone for the weight of the child, 
per the manufacturer’s instructions, the 
CRS is at an increased risk of exceeding 
the 70-degree back angle requirement, 
set by FMVSS No. 213.
7
The risks 
associated with exceeding the 70-degree 
back angle limit include increased crash 
forces to the child’s head and neck and 
the child slipping out of the restraint’s 
internal harness. 
Evenflo has not met its burden of 
persuasion and for the reasons 
described herein NHTSA does not find 
the subject noncompliance is 
inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. 
In reaching this decision, NHTSA 
considered the comment received from 
AHAS and will consider whether 
providing additional information as part 
of the petition process would be 
beneficial for future petitions. NHTSA 
also examined information Evenflo 
submitted in its response to our 
December 18, 2024, Information Request 
related to this noncompliance exhibited 
in our compliance testing. 
VIII. NHTSA’s Decision: In 
consideration of the foregoing, NHTSA 
has decided that Evenflo has not met its 
burden of persuasion that the subject 
FMVSS No. 213 noncompliance is 
inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. 
Accordingly, Evenflo’s petition is 
hereby denied and Evenflo is 
consequently obligated to provide 
notification of and a free remedy for that 
noncompliance under 49 U.S.C. 30118 
and 30120.

ACTION: Final rule; notification of issuance of Letters of Authorization. 
SUMMARY: NMFS, upon request from the U.S. Department of the Navy (including 
the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine 
Corps (Navy)) and on behalf of the U.S. 
Coast Guard (Coast Guard) and U.S. 
Army (Army; hereafter, Navy, Coast 
Guard, and Army are collectively 
referred to as Action Proponents), issues 
these regulations pursuant to the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to 
govern the taking of marine mammals 
incidental to training and testing 
activities and modernization and 
sustainment of ranges conducted in the 
Hawaii-California Training and Testing 
(HCTT) Study Area over the course of 7 
years from December 2025 through 
December 2032. These regulations allow 
for the issuance of letters of 
authorization (LOAs) for the incidental 
take of marine mammals during 
specified activities and timeframes, 
prescribe the permissible methods of 
taking and other means of effecting the 
least practicable adverse impact on 
marine mammal species and their 
habitat, and establish requirements 
pertaining to the monitoring and 
reporting of such taking. The Action 
Proponents’ activities are considered 
military readiness activities pursuant to 
the MMPA, as amended by the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2004 (2004 NDAA) and the NDAA 
for Fiscal Year 2019 (2019 NDAA). 
DATES: Effective from December 21, 2025, through December 20, 2032.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Purpose and Need for Regulatory 
Action 
These regulations, issued under the 
authority of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 
et seq.), allow for the authorization of 
take of marine mammals incidental to 
the Action Proponents’ training and 
testing activities and modernization and 
sustainment of ranges (that qualify as 
military readiness activities) involving 
the use of active sonar and other 
transducers, air guns, and explosives 
(also referred to as ‘‘in-water 
detonations’’); pile driving and vibratory 
extraction; land-based missile and target 
launches; and vessel movement in the 
HCTT Study Area. The HCTT Study 
Area includes areas in the north-central 
Pacific Ocean, from California west to 
Hawaii and the International Date Line, 
and including the Hawaii Range 
Complex (HRC) and Temporary 
Operating Area (TOA), Southern 
California (SOCAL) Range Complex, 
Point Mugu Sea Range (PMSR), Silver 
Strand Training Complex (SSTC), areas 
along the Southern California coastline 
from approximately Dana Point to Port 
Hueneme, and the Northern California 
(NOCAL) Range Complex. Also 
included in the HCTT Study Area are 
Navy pierside locations in Hawaii and 
Southern California, Pearl Harbor, San 
Diego Bay, and the transit corridor on 
the high seas where training and testing 
may occur (see figure 1 of the proposed 
rulemaking and figure 1.1–1 of the 
application). Please see the Legal 
Authority for the Proposed Action 
section for relevant definitions. 
Legal Authority for the Final Action 
The MMPA prohibits the ‘‘take’’ of 
marine mammals, with certain 
exceptions. Section 101(a)(5)(A) and (D) 
of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) 
directs the Secretary of Commerce (as 
delegated to NMFS) to allow, upon 
request, the incidental, but not 
intentional, taking of small numbers of 
marine mammals by U.S. citizens who 
engage in a specified activity (other than 
commercial fishing) within a specified 
geographical region if certain findings 
are made and either regulations are 
proposed or, if the taking is limited to 
harassment, a notice of a proposed 
authorization is provided to the public 
for review and the opportunity to 
submit comment. 
Authorization for incidental takings 
shall be granted if NMFS finds that the 
taking will have a negligible impact on 
the species or stock(s) and will not have 
an unmitigable adverse impact on the 
availability of the species or stock(s) for 
taking for subsistence uses (where 
relevant). Further, NMFS must prescribe 
the permissible methods of taking; other 
‘‘means of effecting the least practicable 
adverse impact’’ on the affected species 
or stocks and their habitat, paying 
particular attention to rookeries, mating 
grounds, and areas of similar 
significance, and on the availability of 
the species or stocks for taking for 
certain subsistence uses (collectively 
referred to as ‘‘mitigation’’); and 
requirements pertaining to the 
monitoring and reporting of the takings. 
The MMPA defines ‘‘take’’ to mean to 
harass, hunt, capture, or kill, or attempt 
to harass, hunt, capture, or kill any 
marine mammal. The Analysis and 
Negligible Impact Determination section 
discusses the definition of ‘‘negligible 
impact.’’ 
The 2004 NDAA (Pub. L. 108–136) 
amended section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA 
to remove the ‘‘small numbers’’ and 
‘‘specified geographical region’’ 
provisions and amended the definition 
of ‘‘harassment’’ as applied to a 
‘‘military readiness activity’’ to read as 
follows (section 3(18)(B) of the MMPA): 
(1) any act that injures or has the 
significant potential to injure a marine 
mammal or marine mammal stock in the 
wild (Level A Harassment); or (2) any 
act that disturbs or is likely to disturb 
a marine mammal or marine mammal 
stock in the wild by causing disruption 
of natural behavioral patterns, 
including, but not limited to, migration, 
surfacing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or 
sheltering, to a point where such 
behavioral patterns are abandoned or 
significantly altered (Level B 
Harassment). The 2004 NDAA also 
amended section 101(a)(5)(A)(iii) of the 
MMPA establishing that ‘‘[f]or military 
readiness activity ..., a determination 
of ‘least practicable adverse impact’ . . . 
shall include consideration of personnel 
safety, practicality of implementation, 
and impact on the effectiveness of the 
military readiness activity.’’ On August 
13, 2018, the 2019 NDAA (Pub. L. 115– 
232) amended the section 
101(a)(5)(A)(ii) of the MMPA to allow 
incidental take regulations (ITRs) for 
military readiness activities to be issued 
for up to 7 years.

based on new information, when 
appropriate. 
Summary of Request 
On September 16, 2024, NMFS 
received an application from the Action 
Proponents requesting authorization to 
take marine mammals, by Level A and 
B harassment, incidental to training, 
testing, and modernization and 
sustainment of ranges (characterized as 
military readiness activities) including 
the use of sonar and other transducers, 
explosives, air guns, impact and 
vibratory pile driving and extraction, 
and land-based missile and target 
launches conducted within the HCTT 
Study Area. The Action Proponents also 
requested authorization to take, by 
serious injury or mortality, a limited 
number of marine mammal species 
incidental to the use of explosives and 
vessel movement during military 
readiness activities conducted within 
the HCTT Study Area. The Action 
Proponents requested multiple 7-year 
LOAs for Navy training activities, Coast 
Guard training activities, Army training 
activities, and Navy testing activities. In 
response to our comments and 
following an information exchange, the 
Action Proponents submitted a revised 
application, deemed adequate and 
complete on December 13, 2024. Also 
on that same date (December 13, 2024), 
NMFS published a notice of receipt of 
the application (NOR) in the Federal 
Register (89 FR 100982), requesting comments and information related to 
the Action Proponents’ specified 
activities. During the 30-day public 
comment period, NMFS received one 
public comment from the Center for 
Biological Diversity. On July 16, 2025, 
NMFS published a proposed rule (90 FR 
32118) and requested comments and 
information related to the Action 
Proponents’ request for 30 days. All 
relevant comments received during the 
NOR and the proposed rulemaking 
comment periods were considered in 
this final rule. Comments received on 
the proposed rule are addressed in this 
final rule in the Comments and 
Responses section. 
NMFS previously promulgated ITRs 
pursuant to the MMPA relating to 
similar military readiness activities in 
areas located within the HCTT Study 
Area. NMFS published the first rule 
effective from January 5, 2009 through 
January 5, 2014, (74 FR 1456, January 
12, 2009) for incidental take relating to 
military readiness activities in the HRC 
and January 14, 2009 through January 
14, 2014 (74 FR 3882) for SOCAL. The 
second rule, effective from December 
24, 2013 through December 24, 2018 (78 
FR 78106, December 24, 2013), 
combined the Hawaii and Southern 
California range complexes, as well as 
the SSTC, pierside locations in San 
Diego Bay and Pearl Harbor, and the 
transit corridor between SOCAL and 
Hawaii, and throughout San Diego Bay. 
The third rule was effective from 
December 21, 2018 through December 
20, 2023 (83 FR 66846, December 27, 
2018), which was subsequently 
amended, extending the effective date 
from December 20, 2023 until December 
20, 2025 (85 FR 41780, July 10, 2020) 
pursuant to the 2019 NDAA and NMFS 
later amended that rule to increase the 
take of large whales by vessel strike and 
modify the mitigation, monitoring, and 
reporting measures to reduce the 
occurrence of vessel strikes involving 
large whales (90 FR 4944, January 16, 
2025). For this rulemaking, the Action 
Proponents plan to conduct 
substantially similar training and testing 
activities within the HCTT Study Area 
that were conducted under previous 
rules (noting that the Study Area has 
been expanded, as described in the 
Geographic Region section of the 
proposed rulemaking). 
The Action Proponents’ application 
reflects the most up-to-date compilation 
of training and testing activities, and 
modernization and sustainment of 
ranges deemed necessary to accomplish 
military readiness requirements. The 
types and numbers of activities 
included in this rule account for 
interannual variability in training and 
testing to meet evolving or emergent 
military readiness requirements. As 
explained herein, these regulations also 
consolidate several actions conducted 
by the Navy that were previously 
authorized by NMFS and include some 
new military readiness activities carried 
out by the Action Proponents. In 
particular, these regulations cover 
incidental take during military 
readiness activities in the HCTT Study 
Area that will occur for a 7-year period 
following the expiration of the pre- 
existing MMPA authorization which 
expires on December 20, 2025 (85 FR 
41780, as amended by 90 FR 4944). In 
addition, this rule includes PMSR 
activities for which incidental take was 
previously authorized under separate 
authorizations and will supersede that 
recent PMSR regulations (87 FR 40888, 
July 8, 2022). This rule also includes 
areas along the Southern California 
coastline from approximately Dana 
Point to Port Hueneme and supersedes 
the incidental harassment authorization 
(IHA) allowing incidental take of marine 
mammals during pile driving training 
activities at Port Hueneme (90 FR 
20283, May 13, 2025). In this rule, we 
have undertaken a comprehensive 
assessment of the risks/impacts of all 
military training and testing activities 
on marine mammals likely to be present 
within the entire range of the Study 
Area. 
Description of Specified Activity 
The Action Proponents requested 
authorization to take marine mammals 
incidental to conducting military 
readiness activities. The Action 
Proponents have determined that 
acoustic and explosives stressors are 
likely to result in take of marine 
mammals in the form of Level A and B 
harassment, and that a limited number 
of takes by serious injury or mortality 
may result from vessel movement and 
use of explosives (including ship shock 
trials). Detailed descriptions of these 
activities are provided in chapter 2 and 
appendix A of the 2025 HCTT 
Environmental Impact Statement/ 
Overseas Environmental Impact 
Statement (2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS) 
(https://www.nepa.navy.mil/hctteis/) and in the Action Proponents’ 
application (https://
www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/ 
marine-mammal-protection/incidental- 
take-authorizations-military-readiness- 
activities). Of note, the U.S. Air Force 
(USAF) is a joint lead agency for the 
2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS; USAF activities 
consist of air combat maneuvers and air- 
to-air gunnery (a gunnery exercise in 
which fixed-wing aircraft fire medium 
caliber guns at air targets). The Action 
Proponents determined that USAF 
activities would not result in the taking

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258812 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations of marine mammals, and therefore these 
activities are not included in the Action 
Proponents’ application. NMFS concurs 
that these activities are not anticipated 
to result in incidental take of marine 
mammals. As such, no authorization for 
taking marine mammals incidental to 
USAF activities is required and no LOA 
will be issued by NMFS for such USAF 
activities. 
A detailed description of the specified 
activities was provided in our proposed 
rulemaking (90 FR 32118, July 16, 
2025). NMFS hereby refers to the 
information and analysis provided in 
the proposed rule which continue to 
apply to this final rule. Since that time, 
no changes have been made to the 
planned activities, with the exception of 
a reduction in the number of launch 
events at PMSR as described in the 
Changes from the Proposed Rule to the 
Final Rule section. Therefore, a detailed 
description is not provided here. Please 
refer to the proposed rulemaking for the 
complete description of the specified 
activity. 
Foreign Navies 
In furtherance of national security 
objectives, foreign militaries may 
participate in multinational training and 
testing events in the Study Area. 
Foreign military activities that are 
planned by and under the substantial 
control and responsibility of the Action 
Proponents are included in the specified 
activity. These participants could be in 
various training or testing events 
described in appendix A of the 2025 
HCTT EIS/OEIS, and their effects are 
analyzed in this final rule. However, 
when foreign military vessels and 
aircraft operate independently within 
the Study Area as sovereign vessels 
outside the planning, control, and 
responsibility of the Action Proponents, 
those activities are not considered part 
of the specified activity. There are many 
reasons why foreign military vessels 
may traverse U.S. waters or come into 
a U.S. port, or foreign aircraft may enter 
U.S. airspace, not all of which are at the 
request of any of the Action Proponents. 
Foreign military vessels and aircraft 
operate pursuant to their own national 
authorities and have independent rights 
under customary international law, 
embodied in the principle of sovereign 
immunity, to engage in various 
activities on the world’s oceans and in 
associated airspace. 
The most significant joint training 
event is the Rim of the Pacific 
(RIMPAC), a multi-national training 
exercise held biennially primarily in the 
HRC. The participation level of foreign 
military vessels in U.S. Navy-led 
training or testing events within the 
HRC and within SOCAL differs greatly 
between RIMPAC and non-RIMPAC 
years. For example, in 2019 (a non- 
RIMPAC year), there were 0.1 foreign 
navy surface vessel at-sea days (i.e., 1 day = 24 hours) within HRC and 20 
foreign navy at-sea days within SOCAL 
(U.S. Department of the Navy, 2021c). 
Out of 56 U.S.-led training events in 
2019, 4 involved foreign navy vessels, 
with an average time per event of 8.7 
hours. During RIMPAC 2022, foreign 
vessels operated and/or transited 
through the HRC for 576 hours (24 
days). In 2023 (another non-RIMPAC 
year), there was no foreign vessel 
participation within SOCAL. Even in a 
RIMPAC year, the days at sea for foreign 
militaries engaged in a Navy-led 
training or testing activity accounts for 
a small, but variable, percentage 
compared to the U.S. Navy activities. 
For instance, the 2020 foreign military 
participation (a RIMPAC-year) was 1.5 
percent of the U.S. Navy’s average days 
at sea (32 days out of an estimated 2,056 
days at sea). During RIMPAC 2024, 25 
foreign surface vessels participated for a 
combined 5,000 hours in U.S.-led 
training events. Therefore, foreign 
surface vessel activity is estimated to 
conservatively account for up to 10 
percent of the U.S. Navy’s annual at sea 
time in HCTT (205 days out of an 
estimated 2,056 days at sea). In RIMPAC 
2024, 21 U.S. Navy maritime patrol 
aircraft participated, as did 12 foreign 
maritime patrol aircraft. 
When foreign militaries are 
participating in a U.S. Navy-led exercise 
or event, foreign military use of sonar 
and explosives, when combined with 
the Action Proponents’ use of sonar and 
explosives, would not result in 
exceedance of the analyzed levels 
(within each Navy Acoustic Effects 
Model (NAEMO) modeled sonar and 
explosive bin) used for estimating 
predicted impacts, which formed the 
basis of our acoustic impacts effects 
analysis that was used to estimate take 
in this final rule. Please see the 
Mitigation Measures section and 
Reporting section of this final rule for 
information about mitigation and 
reporting related to foreign navy 
activities in the HCTT Study Area. 
Comments and Responses 
We published the proposed rule in 
the Federal Register on July 16, 2025 (90 FR 32118) with a 30-day comment 
period. In that proposed rule, we 
requested public input on our analyses, 
our preliminary findings, and the 
proposed regulations, and requested 
that interested persons submit relevant 
information and comments. During the 
30-day comment period, we received six 
comments. Of this total, one submission 
was from the Marine Mammal 
Commission (Commission), and the 
remaining comments were from non- 
governmental organizations (NGO) and 
private citizens. The majority of the 
comments either opposed or 
recommended revisions to the proposed 
rule. 
NMFS has reviewed and considered 
all relevant public comments received 
on the proposed rule and issuance of the 
LOAs. All substantive, relevant 
comments and our responses are 
described below. We organize our 
comment responses by major categories. 
Impact Analysis and Thresholds 
Comment 1 (ref 20, 21): The 
Commission stated that a 5-minute 
accumulation time for an entire day of 
pile driving is insufficient, particularly 
because of the Commission’s assertion 
that the Navy does not implement, and 
NMFS has not proposed to require, soft- 
start procedures during pile-driving 
training activities. The Commission also 
noted differences in pile driving 
between the proposed rule and another 
recent military readiness activity 
involving pile driving (90 FR 20283, 
May 13, 2025). The Commission 
recommended that NMFS revise: (1) the 
range to effects for pile driving for 
temporary threshold shift (TTS) and 
auditory injury (AUD INJ) based on the 
number of piles of each pile type and 
installation method that would be 
installed on a given day, the number of 
minutes or strikes needed to install each 
pile to depth, and the correct source 
levels, including for vibratory 
installation of 24-inch (in; 0.61 meters 
(m)) sheet piles; (2) the range to effects 
for pile driving for behavioral response 
for vibratory installation of 24-in (0.61 
m) sheet piles based on a source level 
of 159 decibel referenced to 1 
microPascal (dB re 1 mPa) at 11 m; and 
(3) the numbers of takes accordingly for 
the final rule. 
Response: NMFS disagrees with the Commission’s assertion that the source 
levels used for vibratory installation of 
24-inch (0.61 m) sheet piles are 
incorrect. As indicated in the proposed 
rule and technical report ‘‘Quantifying 
Acoustic Impacts on Marine Mammals 
and Sea Turtles: Methods and 
Analytical Approach for Phase IV 
Training and Testing’’ (U.S. Department 
of the Navy, 2024a), hereafter referred to 
as the Acoustic Impacts Technical 
Report, a source level of 159 dB root- 
mean-square (RMS) for vibratory driving 
of 24-inch (0.61 m) steel sheet piles 
measured at 10 m (32.8 ft) (NAVFAC, 
2020) is a reasonable representation of 
likely sound levels.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258813 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations The Navy assumed and NMFS 
concurred that most animals in the area 
of pile driving activities would avoid 
higher sound levels that could cause 
injury over periods of time shorter than 
5 minutes. Furthermore, criteria for 
AUD INJ and TTS are conservative in 
that they do not account for recovery of 
hearing effects during breaks in sound 
exposure (e.g., silent periods as the hammer is repositioned, when 
pinnipeds lift their heads out of the 
water or haul out). 
The Navy considers soft-start 
procedures for impact pile driving to be 
part of its standard operating 
procedures. As such, the 2025 HCTT 
EIS/OEIS, 2024 HCTT Draft EIS/OEIS, 
application, and the HCTT proposed 
rule (90 FR 32118, July 16, 2025) do not 
list soft start as a mitigation measure. 
The Navy states that its standard 
operating procedures are essential to 
safety and mission success and are 
implemented regardless of their 
secondary benefits, whereas its 
mitigation measures are designed 
entirely for the purpose of avoiding or 
reducing impacts to marine mammals. 
As such, the Action Proponents did not 
include a description of the soft-start 
procedure in the mitigation section of 
the application, and NMFS did not 
propose to include soft start as a 
mitigation measure in the proposed 
rule. However, NMFS agrees with the 
Commission that it is appropriate to 
require soft-start procedures as a 
mitigation measure, and this final rule 
clarifies that the Navy must implement 
soft start techniques for impact pile 
driving. 
Comment 2 (ref 12, 79): The 
Commission highlighted multiple points 
regarding the behavioral response 
functions (BRF) following its review of 
the technical report ‘‘Criteria and 
Thresholds for U.S. Navy Acoustic and 
Explosive Effects Analysis (Phase 4)’’ 
(U.S. Department of the Navy, 2025a). 
These points generally relate to the 
upper bound of the BRFs, Southall et al. 
data, odontocete BRFs, sensitive species 
BRFs, harbor porpoise data, pinniped 
BRFs, response severity denotation, and 
inconsistencies in some tables and 
figures. Please see the Commission’s 
letter for a detailed discussion of its 
recommendation. 
The Commission recommended that 
NMFS require the Navy to revise 
Department of the Navy (2025a) to 
clarify and address these points, as that 
document underpins the current and 
future Phase IV rulemakings. The 
Commission also stated that to increase 
efficiency for all of the agencies 
involved and to ensure accurate 
information is being provided for public 
comment, the Commission would 
welcome the opportunity to informally 
review future versions of the Navy’s 
criteria and threshold documents. The 
Commission further recommended that 
NMFS work with the Navy to use the 
dose-response functions that were 
developed from all of the raw data 
rather than those that were regenerated 
for only moderate and severe responses 
and to refrain from extrapolating beyond 
the bounds of the underlying data when 
revising the BRFs. 
In a related comment, a commenter 
stated that NMFS has not incorporated 
recent behavioral response data on 
common dolphins (Southall et al., 
2024), and other important studies 
highlighted by the Commission, into its 
biphasic risk functions. The commenter 
references a fuller description of its 
concern in a comment on the 2024 
Hawaii-California Training and Testing 
(HCTT) Draft EIS/OEIS. 
Response: Regarding the upper bound of the BRFs, the Navy adjusted the 
upper bound of the BRFs in Phase IV to 
more accurately reflect observed 
behavioral data, particularly at higher 
received levels. For example, sonar 
received levels between 170 and 182 dB 
re 1 mPa for humpback whales during 
the 3S2 study (the second phase of the 
Sea Mammals, Sonar, Safety (3S) 
project) and between 175 and 186 dB re 
1 mPa for sperm whales during the 3S3 study (the third phase of the 3S project) 
did not elicit observable responses. See 
section 3.1.6.1.2 of the Criteria and 
Thresholds Technical Report for 
discussion of the 3S and 3S2 study, and 
section and 3.1.6.1.3 for discussion of 
the 3S3 study. Please see table E–1 in 
the Criteria and Thresholds Technical 
Report for details of all individual 
responses documented during studies in 
conjunction with received levels of 
sonar and sonar like sources. 
The descriptions of responses in 
appendix E (Behavioral Responses to 
Sonar and Sonar-Like Sources: All 
Individuals Included) of the Criteria and 
Thresholds Technical Report were 
updated to include additional 
information on the observed responses. 
Extending the upper bound to 200 dB 
re 1 mPa allows the BRFs to account for 
this lack of response at higher received 
levels. This adjustment does not 
arbitrarily shift the entire curve to the 
right, as the Commission suggests. For 
groups like pinnipeds, where responses 
are consistently observed at lower 
received levels, the BRF approaches 100 
percent response probability at 185 dB 
re 1 mPa. Therefore, the upper bound 
adjustment primarily impacts the 
odontocete and mysticete BRFs, 
reflecting the observed data at higher 
exposures. It is also important to note 
that the lower bound of the BRFs were 
extended to 90 dB re 1 mPa in Phase IV 
(compared to the 100 dB re 1 mPa lower 
limit used in Phase III), further 
demonstrating that the adjustments 
were not solely focused on increasing 
the upper bound. 
The Commission’s observation of a 
flat slope between 185 and 200 dB re 1 
mPa for the Phase III BRFs shown in 
figure 42 (U.S. Department of the Navy, 
2024a) was a result of anchoring the 
Phase III BRFs at 185 dB re 1 mPa and 
then extending them to 200 dB re 1 mPa 
for plotting purposes. 
Finally, regarding the point that the 
upper level of the mysticete BRF 
exceeds the TTS onset, it is important 
to emphasize that auditory and 
behavioral criteria are not directly 
linked. The Navy recognizes the 
evolving nature of acoustic science and 
will continue to refine its effects criteria 
as new data and understanding become 
available. 
Regarding data from Southall et al. 
(2024), the Navy develops its BRFs 
using the best available scientific data. 
While data from the Atlantic behavioral 
response study (BRS) cited by the 
Commission were collected during the 
timeframe referenced, these data are not 
available for use in the development of 
the BRFs for Phase IV. These functions 
are always developed in close 
consultation with scientists conducting 
BRS/controlled exposure experiment 
(CEE) studies, but when the data are not 
yet published, the researchers determine 
the appropriate time at which to share 
data with the Navy. In this case, 
Atlantic BRS behavioral response 
results have not been shared in time for 
the development of the Navy risk 
thresholds. The Navy did consider data 
from Southall et al. (2024) in appendix 
D of the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS, 
indicating the potential responses 
observed in this study occurred at 
received levels and distances assessed 
for potentially significant behavioral 
responses in the analysis of Phase IV; 
however, the findings of this study do 
not change the conclusions made by the 
Navy nor NMFS’ determination. The 
Navy remains committed to 
incorporating the best available 
scientific data into its impact 
assessments and will revisit its BRFs as 
new information, including the 
published results of the Atlantic BRS, 
becomes available. 
Regarding the odontocete BRF, all the 
data from Houser et al. (2013a, 2013b) 
were included in the modified risk 
functions developed for subsampling in 
the Navy’s BRFs. However, low-severity 
responses were classified as ‘‘non- 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  19:02 Dec 16, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\17DER2.SGM 17DER2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258814 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations responses’’ when deriving the BRFs (see 
also Southall et al. (2021) for a 
description of severity scoring). This 
approach, consistent with Phase III, 
reflects that low-severity behavioral 
responses are not typically considered 
‘‘harassment’’ under the MMPA during 
military readiness activities. To balance 
field and captive study data, a 
subsampling method was used. This 
involved creating modified risk 
functions incorporating the new scoring 
values (classifying low-severity 
responses as non-responses) at different 
received levels. Thirty data points were 
then randomly selected from the 
bottlenose dolphin risk function 
generated using this method. This 
subsampling approach, similar to that 
used for beaked whale data in both 
Phase III and Phase IV, ensures each 
individual animal from the captive 
study receives equal weight, comparable 
to individuals from field studies. This 
allows for a more comprehensive 
consideration of exposures and 
responses for each species, unlike Phase 
III’s selection of a single response level 
per individual. The Navy clarified this 
methodology in the Criteria and 
Thresholds Technical Report. Further, 
the Navy’s current Odontocete BRF 
considers the potential for behavioral 
responses that may qualify as 
‘harassment’ under the MMPA for 
military readiness activities at the 
estimated received levels in Southall et 
al. (2024). Regarding the sensitive species BRF, 
while the generalized additive model 
(GAM) published in Jacobson et al. 
(2022) only extended to 165 dB, the 
Navy requested that authors rerun their 
model to 200 dB to create a new curve 
that could be subsampled for the Navy 
Phase IV risk function; the same was 
done for the Moretti et al. (2014) data. 
Therefore, the two beaked whale range- 
based risk functions extended to the 
same bandwidth as the Navy BRF and 
the subsampling matched the rest of the 
data. Navy updated the Criteria and 
Thresholds Technical Report to reflect 
that the published GAMs were rerun 
with the broader bandwidth. Both 
Moretti et al. (2014) and Jacobson et al. (2022) were subsampled 10 times each. 
To be included in the BRF, data sets 
need to relate known or estimable 
received levels to observations of 
individual or group behavior. The data 
in Falcone et al. (2017) was not 
included in the development of the 
BRFs because it is not possible to 
reasonably estimate the received levels 
in this study; however, this data was 
considered in developing the distance 
conditions for the application of the 
Sensitive Species BRF. 
The Navy and NMFS are committed 
to ensuring scientific integrity in 
datasets used for BRF development. 
Using data that do not meet these 
criteria could result in unreliable or 
misleading risk assessments. A risk 
function has not yet been fit to Southern 
California Anti-Submarine Warfare 
Range (SOAR) data for beaked whales, 
nor has one been fit for minke whales 
at Pacific Missile Range Facility 
(PMRF). The BRFs in Phase IV utilized 
only individual response-RL data 
outside of the four pre-existing risk 
functions that were subsampled. There 
were no individual response-RL data 
available for beaked whales at SOAR 
nor for minke whales at PMRF, therefore 
those data were not used in the Phase 
IV BRFs. As science continues to evolve, 
the Navy and NMFS will continue to 
refine the effects criteria. The Navy 
remains committed to incorporating 
new data and analyses, including those 
from SOAR and PMRF, as they become 
available and meet the rigorous 
standards required for robust BRF 
development. 
Regarding the Kastelein harbor 
porpoise data, when the same 
individuals were tested at multiple 
received levels for the same source 
within a single study, only the lowest 
received level eliciting a response was 
included in the data used for BRF 
development. However, in some studies, 
Kastelein tested the same sources using 
different parameters, such as an 
upsweep versus a downsweep signal 
(e.g., Kastelein et al. (2014b), where both low frequency and mid frequency 
active sonar signals were tested as both 
a downsweep and upsweep), or as a 
continuous versus pulsed active sonar 
signal (e.g., Kastelein et al., 2018). In that case, the response to both signal 
parameters would have been used in the 
BRF as those would be considered 
different signals. The citations for the 
relevant Kastelein studies, previously 
provided in tables 19 and 20, were 
added to table E–1 in the Criteria and 
Thresholds Technical Report. 
Regarding the pinniped BRFs, the 
Navy confirms that all data from the 
Houser et al. (2013a) California sea lion controlled exposure experiment were 
considered in developing the Phase IV 
BRFs. However, as with the odontocete 
BRF, low-severity responses were 
classified as ‘‘non-responses’’ when 
deriving the BRF. This decision aligns 
with the Navy’s approach to assessing 
potential harassment under the MMPA 
during military readiness activities, 
where low-severity responses are not 
typically considered indicative of 
harassment. The original curves 
developed by Houser et al. (2013a) were 
not used because they included the low- 
severity responses as responses 
indicative of harassment. The Navy 
clarified this approach in the Criteria 
and Thresholds Technical Report. 
Regarding the identified 
inconsistencies in some data, tables, and 
figures, NMFS and the Navy have 
carefully reviewed those identified in 
the Commission’s comments and the 
Navy made the necessary corrections to 
the Criteria and Thresholds Technical 
Report. These revisions ensure 
consistency in the reported ranges of 
received levels, distances, and 
significant responses across the 
executive summary, tables, figures, and 
accompanying text. Specifically, the 
Navy updated table E–1 in the Criteria 
and Thresholds Technical Report to 
include data for Blainville’s beaked 
whales from Tyack et al. (2011). The 
studies by Moretti et al. (2014) and 
Jacobson et al. (2022) involved aggregated and modeled data rather than 
individual animal responses and were 
therefore incorporated into the BRFs 
through a random subsampling process, 
as described in the Criteria and 
Thresholds Technical Report, rather 
than being presented directly in table E– 
1, which focuses on individual-level 
data. The Navy also addressed 
inconsistencies between Cure´et al. 
(2025) and table E–1 of Criteria and 
Thresholds Technical Report identified 
by the Commission. The Navy updated 
the closest points of approach so that 
the onset closest point of approach is 
given for signals that elicited significant 
responses, while the closest point of 
approach of the overall exposure session 
is given for signals that did not elicit a 
significant response. These corrections 
only affect the way data was presented 
in table E–1 and do not change the 
BRFs. 
Finally, the Navy has confirmed to 
NMFS that it used the data from Houser 
et al. (2013a) and Houser et al. (2013b) 
to develop the new risk functions. As 
noted previously, low-severity 
responses were scored as ‘‘non- 
responses’’ within these functions to 
align with the Navy’s approach to 
assessing potential harassment under 
the MMPA. These new risk functions 
were then subsampled using the same 
method applied to the beaked whale 
range risk functions in both Phase III 
and Phase IV, ensuring consistency in 
the Navy’s treatment of such data. This 
subsampling approach, described in 
detail within those reports, ensures 
appropriate weighting of individual 
responses and contributes to the 
robustness of the Navy’s BRFs. 
Regarding the Commissions’ offer to 
informally review future versions of the 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  19:02 Dec 16, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\17DER2.SGM 17DER2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258815 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations criteria and threshold reports, NMFS 
recommends that the Commission 
coordinate directly with the Navy for 
any potential early reviews as the Navy 
is the primary author. 
Comment 3 (ref 13): The Commission 
recommended that NMFS work with the 
Navy in a concerted manner to 
incorporate data that support criteria 
and threshold development more often 
than on a decadal cycle and to revise 
NAEMO to implement the relevant 
criteria and thresholds at a true post- 
processing stage so that animat (i.e., a virtual animal) dosimeter data can be re- 
queried if thresholds change, rather than 
needing to remodel the animat-portion 
of NAEMO. 
Response: The Criteria and Thresholds are typically updated at the 
beginning of each at-sea Phase. This is 
a significant effort that involves 
collecting published data, working with 
marine mammal researchers to collect 
and understand emergent data, 
developing methods to incorporate the 
data, writing and publishing the 
technical report, and seeking approvals 
from Navy leadership and NMFS. 
Nevertheless, emergent data is 
continuously assessed against the 
current criteria and thresholds to 
ascertain whether it would create 
significant changes to the Navy’s 
analysis. If so, the analysis would be 
altered to reflect this emergent data. 
The Navy is continuously reassessing 
and evolving its analytical methods 
including the need to more frequently 
update criteria and threshold and the 
feasibility for NAEMO to more rapidly 
incorporate such changes. For example, 
the Navy has undertaken efforts to 
investigate the feasibility of moving the 
weighting functions to the post- 
processor for impulsive modeling, 
which would allow added flexibility to 
the modeling process when new data 
emerges outside of the normal criteria 
and threshold timeline. NMFS supports 
such efforts. 
Comment 4 (ref 10): The Commission 
recommended that NMFS determine 
whether inclusion of data from 
Kastelein et al. (2024a, 2025a, 2025b) would alter the weighting functions 
and/or thresholds for the functional 
hearing groups and, if so, whether those 
modifications would be sufficient to 
warrant revision of the weighting 
functions and associated thresholds for 
non-impulsive sources as stipulated in 
the Criteria and Thresholds Technical 
Report. 
Response: Whether and when to share data for ongoing research is at the 
discretion of the researchers and 
funding agencies. Since the specific data 
from Kastelein et al. (2024a) were not 
shared with the Navy prior to peer 
review and publication, the data could 
not be incorporated into the 
development of the Phase IV Criteria 
and Thresholds. However, the Navy’s 
current approach using the existing 
Phase IV criteria remains protective 
even when compared to the findings of 
Kastelein et al. (2024a). Specifically, incorporating the TTS onset value of 
169 dB sound exposure level (SEL) 
reported by Kastelein et al. (2024a) 
would raise the very high frequency 
(VHF) non-impulse exposure function 
by 4 dB. The impact on other impulsive 
and non-impulsive exposure functions 
is negligible (1 dB or less). 
NMFS has also reviewed the data 
from Kastelein et al. (2024b, 2025a, 
2025b). Kastelein et al. (2025a) 
evaluated the effect of one-sixth octave 
band noise centered at 40 kilohertz 
(kHz) on TTS in two California sea lions 
(Zalophus californianus). Results 
indicate that TTS onset (6 dB threshold 
shift) occurred at approximately 169 dB 
cumulative SEL, which is lower than 
predicted by the current Phase IV TTS 
threshold and weighting function. 
Interestingly, this TTS onset level is 
lower than what was measured during 
exposure to 32 kHz in a previous study 
(179 dB cumulative SEL; Kastelein et al. 
(2024b)). So, despite hearing sensitivity 
decreasing at higher frequencies, 
Kastelein et al. (2025a) indicate that TTS onset occurs at a lower level than 
predicted, which contradicts typical 
trends in TTS onset previously 
measured in marine mammals. Thus, 
these data suggest a need to evaluate 
exposures at potentially higher 
frequencies to examine whether this 
disparate trend continues. 
Kastelein et al. (2025b) examined TTS in two harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) 
exposed to one-sixth octave band noise 
centered at 8 kHz. In this study, TTS 
onset (6 dB threshold shift) occurred at 
approximately 181 dB cumulative SEL, 
which is higher than what is predicted 
with the current Navy Phase IV criteria. 
In consideration of the information 
discussed above, NMFS and Navy have 
concluded that revisions to the Phase IV 
criteria and thresholds are not 
warranted at this time. 
Comment 5 (ref 11, 78): The 
Commission recommended that NMFS 
determine whether the low frequency 
(LF) cetacean weighting function has 
been shifted far enough to the higher 
frequencies to reflect that 32 kHz was 
the most sensitive frequency tested in 
minke whales, determine whether use of 
the phocid carnivore in water (PCW) 
composite audiogram, weighting 
function, and threshold parameters are 
more representative of very low- 
frequency (VLF) and LF cetaceans than 
medians and means of the five other 
functional hearing groups, and work 
with the Navy to revise the VLF and LF 
cetacean composite audiograms, 
weighting functions, and thresholds as 
needed for impulsive and non- 
impulsive sources for the final rule and 
2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS. 
In a related comment, a commenter 
stated that NMFS has applied a patently 
unrealistic, non-conservative auditory 
weighting scheme for ‘‘low frequency 
cetaceans’’ and references a similar 
comment on the 2024 HCTT Draft EIS/ 
OEIS. 
Response: The lack of data on mysticete hearing, especially in terms of 
the impacts of noise on hearing, has 
made this a challenging group for which 
to develop acoustic criteria. The Navy 
has split the mysticetes into two hearing 
groups for its Phase IV analyses: VLF 
and LF cetaceans (see appendix B of the 
Criteria and Thresholds Technical 
Report). This decision is outlined in 
detail within the documentation and 
includes the best available science 
including the recommendations of 
Southall et al. (2019c) and the minke whale study by Houser et al. (2024). 
Navy was given access to pre-published 
data on the 2023/2024 minke whale 
field season and was able to incorporate 
into their Phase IV criteria (noting, as 
the commenter did, that the 2023 field 
season data was published in November 
2024). In their Phase IV criteria, the 
Navy separated VLF cetaceans (i.e., 
blue, fin, right, and bowhead) whales 
from LF cetaceans (all other mysticetes). 
Thus, they are acknowledging 
differences among mysticetes species. 
NMFS and the Navy disagree that 
wholesale adoption of the PCW 
parameters or shifting the LF weighting 
function solely based on the 32 kHz 
sensitivity of minke whales is 
scientifically justified. There is no 
scientific evidence to support the 
exclusive use of the PCW composite 
audiogram and weighting function 
parameters for the LF and VLF groups. 
Adolescent minke whales were tested 
by Houser et al. (2024) specifically 
because of their small size compared to 
other baleen whales. Smaller head size 
generally facilitates hearing at higher 
frequencies, so a shift of the entire LF 
curve (intended to represent all species 
within the hearing group) to a center 
frequency of 32 kHz is not likely 
representative of most baleen whales, 
which are larger in size compared to 
adolescent minke whales. 
Therefore, the Navy maintains, and 
NMFS concurs, that based on the weight 
of the evidence, the existing LF 
weighting function and the use of

functional hearing groups provide a 
more representative and protective 
approach for assessing acoustic impacts 
on VLF and LF cetaceans. This 
approach incorporates data from a 
broader range of species and avoids 
overreliance on data from a single 
species or functional hearing group. 
NMFS’ approach has remained 
consistent throughout our Technical 
Guidance development (2016, 2018, 
2024), and we have addressed 
comments on the LF cetacean weighting 
function in our previous Federal 
Register notices finalizing these documents (81 FR 51693, August 4, 
2016; 89 FR 84872, October 24, 2024). 
NMFS’ 2024 Technical Acoustic 
Guidance does not incorporate the 
recent data on minke whale hearing. 
However, NMFS has committed to 
incorporating this data into future 
versions, as indicated in our 2024 
Updated Technical Guidance. NMFS is 
awaiting publication of results from the 
2024 field season before re-evaluating 
our acoustic criteria for mysticetes. 
Comment 6 (ref 14): The Commission 
recommended that NMFS work with the 
Navy to reprogram NAEMO to 
implement densities at a post- 
processing stage so that densities can be 
easily revised rather than needing to 
remodel the animat-portion of NAEMO 
when density estimates change. The 
Commission states that such an 
improvement was recommended by 
Simmons et al. (2025) to be addressed through modifications to animat seeding 
and investigating runs by hearing group 
within NAEMO. 
Response: NMFS concurs that it is appropriate to explore whether NAEMO 
can be reprogrammed to implement 
densities at a post-processing stage so 
that densities can be easily revised 
rather than needing to remodel the 
animat-portion of NAEMO when 
density estimates change. The Navy has 
undertaken work in Fiscal Year 2025 to 
explore standardization of animat 
distributions and statistical 
considerations of applying species’ 
densities after the NAEMO post- 
processor to scale results. If the Navy, in 
coordination with NMFS, finds that this 
proves feasible and appropriate, the 
Navy hopes to implement this for Phase 
V. 
Comment 7 (ref 17, 18): The 
Commission recommended that NMFS 
work with the Navy to use an avoidance 
swim speed of no more than 2 m per 
second (m/second) for harbor porpoises 
and 1 m/second for pinnipeds and to 
revise the NAEMO modeling and take 
estimates appropriately for the final 
rule. The Commission further 
recommended that NMFS work with the 
Navy to incorporate moving animats 
into NAEMO that can actively avoid 
sound sources based on species-specific 
dive profiles and swim speeds for Phase 
V activities (which would occur in 
HCTT from 2032 to 2039) and, if that is 
not feasible, incorporate species-specific 
swim speeds and the actual modeled 
sound propagation into NAEMO to 
simulate avoidance for a given event. 
The Commission stated that both 
creating an emulator and running 
simulation studies outside of NAEMO, 
as recommended by Simmons et al. 
(2025), should inform how best to deal 
with moving animats and implementing 
avoidance within NAEMO. 
Response: NMFS and the Navy acknowledge the importance of using 
appropriate swim speeds in the 
avoidance analysis in NAEMO, which 
assesses the potential for marine 
mammals to mitigate high-intensity 
sound exposures that could lead to 
auditory injury. While baseline swim 
speeds can be informative, the Navy 
prioritized data on swim behavior 
observed near and during anthropogenic 
disturbance because these data were 
considered more representative of how 
animals might respond to acoustic 
stimuli and potentially reduce injury 
risk. NMFS concurs with this approach. 
The Commission referenced a study 
by Kastelein et al. (2018) as support for 
a lower harbor porpoise swim speed. 
However, the cited speed of 7.1 
kilometers per hour (km/hr) represents 
the sustained average speed of a single 
captive harbor porpoise in a relatively 
small pool during a pile driving 
playback study at exposures below 
those causing auditory injury. This 
specific observation does not accurately 
reflect the full range of harbor porpoise 
swim capabilities. As documented in 
table 8 of the appendix to the Acoustic 
Impacts Technical Report, data from 
free-swimming harbor porpoises 
indicate swim speeds up to and 
exceeding 3 m/second, supporting the 
Navy’s chosen value for modeling 
avoidance. 
For pinnipeds, the avoidance analysis 
used a reasonable swim speed of 2 m/ 
second for a limited duration (10 
minutes), acknowledging the lack of 
observed data on their swim behavior 
during acoustic exposures. This 
assumption balances the need for a 
realistic representation of potential 
avoidance behavior with the limited 
data availability, contributing to a 
conservative assessment of potential 
impacts. 
The Navy’s approach to modeling 
impacts is described in the Acoustic 
Impacts Technical Report. NMFS has 
reviewed the Acoustic Impacts 
Technical Report and concurs with the 
Navy that the approach is based on the 
best available science. In early NAEMO 
development, the Navy compared the 
number of exposures (i.e., >120 dB) using the Marine Mammal Movement 
and Behavior (3MB) model versus 
horizontally stationary animats and 
concluded that there was no significant 
difference in behavioral exposures 
between the two distribution methods. 
Thus, horizontally stationary animats 
were selected for computational 
efficiency. 
NMFS and the Navy recognize the 
evolving nature of modeling techniques 
and acknowledge the Commission’s 
desire for more dynamic and species- 
specific avoidance behaviors in future 
iterations of NAEMO. NMFS has 
encouraged the Navy to continue to 
explore NAEMO enhancements, and the 
Navy has indicated that it will consider 
species-specific swim speeds and 
potentially more complex movement 
models, as data availability and 
computational capabilities allow. 
Currently, however, detailed avoidance 
data for many species are limited, 
necessitating the use of surrogate data 
and generalized approaches, as is also 
the case with dive profiles. 
The Navy states that it will continue 
to prioritize research and development 
efforts to enhance the accuracy of its 
impact modeling tools, ensuring the best 
available science informs its 
environmental assessments. 
Comment 8 (ref 19): The Commission 
recommended that NMFS work with the 
Navy to use its Range-Dependent 
Acoustic Model and the Navy’s 
Standard Parabolic Equation (RAM/PE) 
model for non-impulsive sources to 
model all underwater detonations (i.e., 
impulsive sources) for Phase IV 
activities for which modeling has not 
been completed and for all Phase V 
activities, until such time that 
Comprehensive Acoustic Simulation 
System/Gaussian Ray Bundle (CASS/ 
GRAB) and the similitude equation have 
been validated for the range of 
detonation sizes and environmental 
parameters (i.e., water depth and receiver range) in which it would be 
used. They supported this 
recommendation by stating that, given 
the comparability of the modeled zones 
from the Peregrine version of RAM/PE 
to the measured values and that RAM/ 
PE is already used by the Navy for 
modeling non-impulsive sources that 
operate at less than 100 Hz and in 
shallow water, the Navy has the data to 
conduct a rigorous comparison of 
CASS/GRAB and the similitude 
equation and the in situ measurements

Seger et al. (2023) to fulfill the project’s intent and to inform future rulemakings. 
Response: Navy has indicated that it plans to conduct a verification of the 
impulsive propagation methods in 
NAEMO using the Seger et al. (2023) 
data, which was published by 
Madhusudhana et al. (2024). The NAEMO impulsive modeling 
methods, as described in the Acoustic 
Impacts Technical Report, require 
arrival times, sound levels, and phases 
to be output from the propagation 
model. RAM/PE does not output the 
time information necessary for 
simulation and is thus not a suitable 
option for impulsive modeling in 
NAEMO. The limitations of the 
similitude equation are discussed in 
section 4.1.3.2 of the Acoustic Impacts 
Technical Report and comparisons 
between the peak pressure computed at 
various ranges against the theoretical 
value based on the similitude equation 
showed agreement, providing 
confidence that the similitude equation 
was appropriate for use in NAEMO. 
The Navy states that it is committed 
to ensuring the accuracy of its impulsive 
propagation models and recognizes the 
importance of ongoing validation 
efforts. While the similitude equation 
has been evaluated and demonstrated 
good agreement with measured data, as 
detailed in section 4.1.3.2 of the 
Acoustic Impacts Technical Report, the 
Navy is open to exploring alternative 
approaches to meet NAEMO’s 
requirements. 
Comment 9 (ref 16): The Commission 
continues to maintain that NMFS has 
not provided adequate justification for 
dismissing the possibility that single 
underwater detonations can cause a 
behavioral response, and, therefore, 
again recommended that it estimate and 
authorize takes by Level B harassment 
of marine mammals during all explosive 
activities, including those that involve 
single detonations and gunnery 
exercises that have several detonations 
occurring within a few seconds. The 
Commission further recommends that 
NMFS encourage the Navy to invest 
resources in conducting BRSs on marine 
mammals’ responses, including 
pinniped responses, to underwater 
detonations for the derivation of 
explosive BRFs, or at the very least a 
source-specific step-function threshold, 
noting that the Navy’s Living Marine 
Resources program has provided 
funding for a few opportunistic studies 
involving behavioral response of 
cetaceans exposed to underwater 
detonations. 
Response: NMFS acknowledges the possibility that single underwater 
detonations (including some multiple 
explosive events, such as certain naval 
gunnery exercises, that may be treated 
as a single event because a few 
explosions occur closely spaced within 
a very short time (a few seconds)) can 
cause a behavioral response. The 
current take estimate framework allows 
for the consideration of animals 
exhibiting behavioral disturbance 
during single explosions as they are 
counted as ‘‘taken by Level B 
harassment’’ if they are exposed above 
the TTS threshold, which is 5 dB higher 
than the behavioral harassment 
threshold for multiple detonations. We 
acknowledge in our analysis that 
individuals exposed above the TTS 
threshold may also be harassed by 
behavioral disruption and those 
potential impacts are considered in the 
Analysis and Negligible Impact 
Determination section. Neither NMFS 
nor the Navy are aware of evidence to 
support the assertion that animals will 
have multiple significant behavioral 
responses (i.e., those that would qualify as take) to temporally and spatially 
isolated explosions at received levels 
below the TTS threshold. However, if 
any such responses were to occur, they 
would be expected to be rare and since 
separated in space and time, would 
most likely result only in isolated startle 
responses (i.e., additional behavioral responses would not be expected to add 
cumulatively or in severity). 
Furthermore, these rare responses 
would not be expected to occur at 
received levels below TTS onset. Thus, 
they would occur at received levels 
already bounded by the single 
detonation criteria (i.e., TTS is used as the Level B harassment criteria for 
single detonations) and would therefore 
already be accounted for in the current 
take estimates. 
The derivation of the explosive injury 
criteria is provided in the Criteria and 
Thresholds Technical Report. There is 
limited information upon which to 
estimate behavioral response thresholds 
specific to explosives. Therefore, as 
described in the Criteria and Thresholds 
Technical Report, the behaviors 
exhibited by animals exposed to brief 
intense tones in the Schlundt et al. 
(2000) study continue to inform the 
behavioral response threshold for 
explosives. Some of the observed 
behaviors in that study would be 
considered moderate severity for captive 
animals with trained behaviors and thus 
may be potentially significant in the 
context of wild animals. Appropriate 
threshold metrics are applied for this 
criterion given the supporting data. 
Additionally, RMS sound pressure 
levels (SPLs) are not a preferred metric 
for explosives due to the challenge of 
identifying the appropriate time 
window. 
Most explosive activities, including 
all explosive gunnery activities, 
analyzed in the rule and the 2025 HCTT 
EIS/OEIS include multiple detonations. 
For these activities, significant 
behavioral responses are assumed to 
occur if the cumulative SELs are greater 
than or equal to 5 dB less than the 
threshold for onset of TTS. For single 
detonations, the analysis in appendix E 
of the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS assumes 
that any auditory impact (TTS or AUD 
INJ) may have a concurrent significant 
behavioral response. This assumption 
for single detonations has been clarified 
in the Criteria and Thresholds Technical 
Report. 
BRSs on marine mammal responses to 
underwater detonations would support 
future analyses, and NMFS will 
consider such a recommendation to the 
Navy relative to other new and ongoing 
research priorities. The Navy supports a 
wide range of research to inform the 
development of criteria. The Navy is 
supporting new research into marine 
mammal behavioral responses to 
detonations through its Living Marine 
Resources program (https://
exwc.navfac.navy.mil/Products-and- 
Services/Environmental-Security/LMR/). 
The findings of this research will be 
incorporated into the behavioral 
response criteria when available. To 
clarify, the Navy has specifically 
monitored shock trial detonations since 
the 1990s. Madhusudhana et al. (2024) 
present data on pre- and post-detonation 
vocalizations at monitoring sites in the 
vicinity of the 2021 full ship shock trial. 
Most sites showed no significant 
changes in vocalization activity for the 
timeframes analyzed. 
Comment 10 (ref 66): A commenter 
recommended that, in addition to the 
designation of geographic mitigation 
areas identified above, efforts should be 
undertaken in an iterative manner to 
identify additional important habitat 
areas across the HCTT Study Area, 
using the full range of data and 
information available (e.g., habitat-based density models, NMFS-recognized 
Biologically Important Areas (BIAs), 
Endangered Species Act (ESA) critical 
habitat designations, passive acoustic 
monitoring data, other survey data, 
oceanographic and other environmental 
data).

funded monitoring and research in the

In addition, NMFS consulted 
Calambokidis et al. (2024) and Kratofil et al. (2023), which provides a specific, 
detailed assessment of known BIAs, 
which may be region-, species-, and/or 
time-specific, include reproductive 
areas, feeding areas, migratory corridors, 
and areas in which small and resident 
populations are concentrated. While the 
science of marine mammal occurrence, 
distribution, and density resides as a 
core NMFS mission, the Navy does 
provide extensive support to the NMFS 
mission via ongoing HCTT specific 
monitoring as detailed in this final rule. 
Also included are direct Navy funding 
support to NMFS for programmatic 
marine mammal surveys in Hawaii and 
the U.S. West Coast, and spatial habitat 
model improvements. 
Comment 11 (ref 68): A commenter 
stated that there is a need for the Navy 
to compile more information regarding 
the number, nature, and timing of 
testing and training events that take 
place within, or in close proximity to, 
important habitat areas, and to refine its 
scale of analysis of operations to match 
the scale of the habitat areas that are 
considered to be important. The 
commenter states that while the 2024 
HCTT Draft EIS/OEIS, in assessing 
environmental impacts on marine 
mammals, breaks down estimated 
impacts by region, the resolution is 
seldom greater than range complex or 
homeport and is not specifically focused 
on areas of higher biological 
importance. Current and ongoing efforts 
to identify important habitat areas for 
marine mammals should be used by the 
Navy as a guide to the most appropriate 
scale(s) for the analysis of operations. 
Response: In their take request and effects analysis provided to NMFS, the 
Action Proponents considered historic 
use (number and nature of training and 
testing activities) and locational 
information of training and testing 
activities when developing modeling 
boxes. The timing of training cycles and 
testing needs varies based on 
deployment requirements to meet 
current and emerging threats. Due to the 
variability, the Action Proponents’ 
description of the specified activities is 
structured to provide flexibility in 
training and testing locations, timing, 
and number. In addition, information 
regarding the exact location of sonar 
usage is classified. Due to the variety of 
factors, many of which influence 
locations that cannot be predicted in 
advance (e.g., weather), the analysis is completed at a scale that is necessary to 
allow for flexibility. The purpose of the 
Action Proponents’ quantitative 
acoustic analysis is to provide the best 
estimate of impact/take to marine 
mammals and ESA-listed species for the 
regulatory and ESA section 7 
consultation analyses. Specifically, the 
analysis must take into account multiple 
training and testing activities over large 
areas of the ocean for multiple years; 
therefore, analyzing activities in 
multiple locations over multiple seasons 
produces the best estimate of impacts/ 
take to inform the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS 
and regulators. Also, the scale at which 
spatially explicit marine mammal 
density models are structured is 
determined by the data collection 
method and the environmental variables 
that are used to build the model. 
Therefore, altogether, given the 
variables that determine when and 
where the Action Proponents train and 
test, as well as the resolution of the 
density data, the analysis of potential 
impacts is scaled to the level that the 
data fidelity will support. NMFS has 
worked with the Navy over the years to 
increase the spatio-temporal specificity 
of the descriptions of activities planned 
in or near areas of biological 
importance, when possible (e.g., in BIAs or Sanctuaries, where possible). 
The HCTT analysis in the Action 
Proponents’ application (see appendix 
A of the application) includes improved 
modeling since Phase III to predict the 
number of expected takes, by effect 
type, within important habitat areas 
such as identified BIAs and ESA- 
designated critical habitat. NMFS is 
confident that the granularity of 
information provided sufficiently allows 
for an accurate assessment of both the 
impacts of the Action Proponents’ 
activities on marine mammal 
populations and the protective measures 
evaluated to mitigate those impacts. 
NMFS and the Action Proponents will 
continue to consider how to 
appropriately refine our future analyses. 
Comment 12 (ref 77): A commenter 
stated that NMFS has relied improperly 
on means and medians in establishing 
its thresholds for auditory impacts and 
references a similar comment on the 
2024 HCTT Draft EIS/OEIS. In that 
comment, the commenter recommends 
implementation of a 6 dB reduction to 
its TTS and PTS thresholds in line with 
the suggestions by Tougaard et al. 
(2015). The commenter states that a 6 
dB adjustment would accord with the 
minimum level of ‘‘non-trivial’’ TTS 
required to evaluate onset, effectively 
adjusting the exposure functions to 
more closely match the point where 
TTS begins. 
Response: The technical guidance appropriately uses measures of central 
tendency based on an onset level of 6 
dB TTS. No reduction is necessary or 
supported by the scientific literature, 
especially considering numerous other 
conservative methods in the auditory 
criteria. For example, the proposed and 
final rules assume no recovery of 
hearing during time intervals between 
intermittent exposures. However, 
multiple studies from humans, 
terrestrial mammals, and marine 
mammals have demonstrated less TTS 
from intermittent exposures compared 
to continuous exposures with the same 
total energy because hearing is known to 
experience some recovery in between 
noise exposures. Therefore, NMFS’ 
approach in the proposed and final 
rules is known to overestimate the 
effects of intermittent noise sources 
such as tactical sonars. Further, marine 
mammal TTS data have shown that, for 
two exposures with equal energy, the 
longer duration exposure tends to 
produce a larger amount of TTS. Since 
most marine mammal TTS data have 
been obtained using exposure durations 
up to an hour, much longer than the 
durations of many tactical sources, the 
use of the existing marine mammal TTS 
data tends to over-estimate the effects of 
sonars with shorter duration signals. 
Comment 13 (ref 15, 80): The 
Commission recommended that NMFS 
refrain from using cut-off distances in 
conjunction with the Bayesian BRFs and 
re-estimate the numbers of marine 
mammal takes based solely on the 
Bayesian BRFs for the final rule. 
In a related comment, a commenter 
stated that NMFS reduces the Navy’s 
modeled take estimates through the 
application of cut-off distances that do 
not make sense conceptually, that are 
based on little or no data from the 
behavioral response literature, and that 
contradict data that are available, 
including Falcone et al. (2017) and 
Melco´n et al. (2012). The commenter refers to a description of their concern 
in a comment on the 2025 HCTT Draft 
EIS/OEIS, in which they state that they 
agree with the Commission’s 
recommendation that the Navy refrain 
from using cut-off distances and rely 
instead on the take estimates produced 
through its response functions. 
Response: The consideration of proximity (cut-off distances) was part of 
the criteria developed in consultation 
between the Navy and NMFS, and is 
appropriate based on the best available 
science, which shows that marine 
mammal responses to sound vary based 
on both sound level and distance. 
Therefore, these cut-off distances were 
applied within NAEMO. The derivation 
of the BRFs and associated cut-off

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258819 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations distances is provided in the Criteria and 
Thresholds Technical Report. 
The Phase IV approach represents a 
refinement in assessing potential 
behavioral impacts. It employs a 
probability of response condition for 
high source level exposures, addressing 
previous concerns from the Commission 
about potentially cutting off responses 
when the probability remained above 50 
percent. This approach, combined with 
the distance cut-off, provides a more 
nuanced and protective assessment 
compared to the Phase III methodology, 
which relied solely on distance cut-offs. 
Therefore, directly comparing Phase III 
and Phase IV cut-off distances is not 
appropriate. 
NMFS and the Navy are confident 
that this combined distance and 
probability threshold approach is well- 
substantiated by available data and 
effectively avoids underestimating 
potential behavioral responses to 
acoustic sources. 
To clarify, section 3.1.4 (Dose and 
Contextual Responses) of the Criteria 
and Thresholds Technical Report 
explains that at low received levels, 
distance to the sound source factors into 
the likelihood of a behavioral response. 
Although distance was investigated as a 
covariate in the Bayesian BRF model, 
most BRSs to date have used similar 
source levels making received level and 
source-receiver distance tightly 
correlated (see section 3.1.9 (Behavioral 
Cut-off Conditions) of the Criteria and 
Thresholds Technical Report). 
Therefore, including distance in the 
BRF model using the available response- 
received level data did not improve the 
BRFs. Still, NMFS and the Navy agree 
that distance is an important contextual 
factor. Since it was not possible to 
directly account for distance in the 
Bayesian model at this time, the Navy 
incorporated the behavioral cut-off 
conditions, beyond which significant 
behavioral reactions are assumed to be 
unlikely. As described in section 3.1.9 
of the Criteria and Thresholds Technical 
Report, the distance cut-off conditions 
were conservatively estimated based on 
observations from multiple cited 
studies. Applying the distance cut-off 
condition is appropriate to reasonably 
estimate significant impacts. In 
addition, high source level exposures 
are addressed by also using a probability 
of response condition rather than the 
dual distance cut-off applied in Phase 
III. This method was devised in part to 
address public comments, including 
those from the Commission received in 
Phase III that were focused on cutting 
off behavioral responses, in some cases, 
where the probability of response was 
still above 50 percent. The probability of 
response cut-off condition in Phase IV 
allows for prediction of significant 
impacts beyond the distance cut-off. 
Regarding the studies cited by a 
commenter, Melco´n et al. (2012) found that the probability of recording blue 
whale ‘‘D calls’’ decreased with higher 
received levels at the high-frequency 
acoustic recording package (HARP) 
buoy averaged over many hours; 
however, this study does not provide 
any information about the distance 
between the sound source and any 
animals and cannot be used to derive 
cut-off distances. Falcone et al. (2017) 
was reviewed by the Navy and 
discussed in the Criteria and Thresholds 
Technical Report: ‘‘. . . Falcone et al. (2017) modeled apparent responses to 
mid-powered sources out to 50 km (27 
nautical miles (nmi)) and responses to 
high-powered sources at distances as 
great as 100 km (54 nmi). However, the 
models were not developed to estimate 
distances to response, and care needs to 
be taken when interpreting the results in 
that context.’’ Responses at 100 km (54 
nmi) were generally mild, such as a 
slight (i.e., less than 2 minutes) increase in the duration of shallow dives that 
was similar to the range of duration 
variability found in dives when no mid- 
frequency active sonar (MFAS) was 
present. The inter-deep dive interval 
duration also increased for both mid- 
and high-powered MFAS sources 
starting at 100 km (54 nmi); however, 
the inter-deep dive interval duration 
only exhibited the strongest increase 
within 20 km (10.8 nmi) of the source. 
As described in section 3.1.9 of the 
Criteria and Thresholds Technical 
Report, the cut-off conditions are 
applied to predict significant behavioral 
responses. The data used to inform the 
BRFs includes observations beyond 10 
km (5.4 nmi) and studies cited in 
section 3.1.9 of the Criteria and 
Thresholds Technical Report. This 
includes data on exposures to other 
sound sources which is informative 
when data on exposure to sonars is 
limited. All the identified significant 
behavioral responses that were used to 
develop the BRFs are within the cut-offs 
(either by distance or SPL). Although 
behavioral responses are predicted 
beyond the cut-off conditions, these are 
not expected to rise to the level of 
harassment under the MMPA as defined 
for military readiness activities. 
NMFS and the Navy acknowledge the 
Commission’s perspective but maintain 
that the combined use of cut-off 
distances and BRFs provides a more 
accurate and realistic assessment of 
potential behavioral impacts, 
particularly for military readiness 
activities. While Tyack and Thomas 
(2019) cautioned against using step 
functions anchored to the 50 percent 
response level of dose-response curves, 
the Navy’s methodology does not 
employ such an approach. Instead, the 
cut-off distances, informed by the 
farthest observed distances of significant 
behavioral reactions in the available 
data (including those exceeding 10 km 
(5.4 nmi)), serve as a threshold for 
identifying responses reasonably likely 
to qualify as harassment under the 
MMPA. This approach prevents 
underestimating significant impacts 
while acknowledging that responses 
occurring beyond these distances, while 
possible, are less likely to reach this 
level of concern. 
The Navy’s Phase IV approach, 
incorporating both BRFs and 
scientifically informed cut-off distances, 
offers a more realistic assessment of 
potential behavioral impacts compared 
to relying solely on BRFs. This approach 
balances the statistical probabilities 
derived from the BRFs with empirical 
observations of behavioral responses in 
the field. NMFS and the Navy are 
confident that this combined approach, 
while still incorporating conservatism to 
account for uncertainty, does not 
underestimate potential take by Level B 
harassment under the MMPA during 
military readiness activities and 
provides a more accurate representation 
of potential impacts. 
NMFS has independently assessed the 
thresholds used by the Navy to identify 
Level B harassment by behavioral 
disturbance and finds that they 
appropriately apply the best available 
science and it is not necessary to 
recalculate take estimates. As the 
science related to marine mammal 
behavior advances, NMFS and the Navy 
will continue to refine consideration of 
contextual factors, such as distance, in 
its assessment of behavioral responses. 
Comment 14 (ref 81): A commenter 
stated that NMFS wholly discounted 
gas-bubble pathology as a mechanism of 
harm to marine mammals due to the 
specified activities, and that the Action 
Proponents must assume that a number 
of beaked whales are subject to injury 
and mortality from gas-bubble 
formation. 
Response: The commenter’s characterization of NMFS’ analysis is 
incorrect. NMFS does not disregard the 
fact that it is possible for naval activities 
using hull-mounted tactical sonar to 
contribute to the death of marine 
mammals in certain circumstances (that 
are not present in the HCTT Study Area) 
via strandings resulting from 
behaviorally mediated physiological 
impacts or other gas-related injuries. In

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258820 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations Activities on Marine Mammals and 
Their Habitat section of the proposed 
rule, NMFS discusses these potential 
causes and outlines the few cases where 
active naval sonar (in the U.S. or, 
largely, elsewhere) has either potentially 
contributed to or, as with the Bahamas 
example, been more definitively 
causally linked to marine mammal 
strandings. As noted, there are a suite of 
factors that have been associated with 
these specific cases of strandings 
directly associated with sonar (steep 
bathymetry, multiple hull-mounted 
platforms using sonar simultaneously, 
constricted channels, strong surface 
ducts, etc.). These factors are not 
present together in the HCTT Study 
Area during the specified activities. 
Further, there have never been any 
strandings associated with Navy sonar 
use in the HCTT Study Area. For these 
reasons, NMFS does not anticipate that 
the Action Proponents’ training or 
testing activities will result in marine 
mammal strandings, and none are 
authorized. Furthermore, ongoing Navy 
funded beaked whale monitoring at a 
heavily used training and testing area in 
the SOCAL Range Complex has not 
documented mortality or habitat 
abandonment by beaked whales. Passive 
acoustic detections of beaked whales 
have not significantly changed over 10 
years of monitoring (DiMarzio et al., 
2018; DiMarzio et al., 2019; DiMarzio et 
al., 2020). From visual surveys in the area since 2006 there have been 
repeated sightings of the same 
individual beaked whales, beaked whale 
mother-calf pairs, and beaked whale 
mother-calf pairs with mothers on their 
second calf (Schorr et al., 2018; Schorr 
et al., 2020). Satellite tracking studies of 
beaked whales documented high site 
fidelity to this area even though the 
study area is located in one of the most 
used Navy areas in the Pacific (Schorr 
et al., 2018; Schorr et al., 2020). 
Comment 15 (ref 82): A commenter 
stated that NMFS failed to present a 
meaningful analysis of the Navy’s 
aggregate effects on marine mammal 
populations and refers to its comment 
on the 2024 HCTT Draft EIS/OEIS. 
Response: NMFS fully analyzed and considered the potential for aggregate 
effects from all of the Action 
Proponents’ specified activities, and has 
applied a reasoned and comprehensive 
approach to evaluating the effects of 
these activities on marine mammal 
species or stocks and their habitat. This 
analysis was detailed in the Preliminary 
Analysis and Negligible Impact 
Determination section of the proposed 
rule and is included here in the 
Analysis and Negligible Impact 
Determination section of this final rule. 
Our analysis includes consideration 
of unusual mortality events (UMEs) and 
previous environmental impacts, where 
appropriate, to inform the baseline 
levels of both individual health and 
susceptibility to additional stressors, as 
well as stock status. Further, the species 
and stock-specific assessments in the 
Analysis and Negligible Impact 
Determination section (which have been 
updated and expanded since the 
previous HCTT rulemaking to consider 
additional species- and stock-specific 
factors) present and address the 
combined mortality, injury, behavioral 
harassment, and other effects of the 
aggregate activities, including impacts 
anticipated in important habitats such 
as ESA-designated critical habitat and 
known BIAs (and in consideration of 
applicable mitigation), as well as other 
information that supports our 
determinations that the Action 
Proponents’ activities will not adversely 
affect any species or stocks via impacts 
on annual rates of recruitment or 
survival. We refer the reader to the 
Analysis and Negligible Impact 
Determination section for this analysis. 
Further, widespread, extensive 
monitoring since 2006 on Navy ranges 
that have been used for training and 
testing for decades has demonstrated no 
evidence of population-level impacts 
(see https://www.navymarinespeciesmonitoring.us/ 
regions/pacific/current-projects/ for results, e.g., ‘‘Cuvier’s Beaked Whale and Fin Whale Population Dynamics 
and Impact Assessment at the Southern 
California Offshore Antisubmarine 
Warfare Range (SOAR)’’). Based on the 
best available research from NMFS and 
Navy-funded marine mammal studies, 
there is no evidence that ‘‘population- 
level harm’’ to marine mammals, 
including beaked whales, is occurring in 
the HCTT Study Area. 
Comment 16 (31): A commenter stated 
that the Eastern North Pacific stock of 
gray whale has been declining for years 
since the recent UME, and that NOAA 
estimates 13,000 Eastern North Pacific 
gray whales, rather than 26,960 whales 
as reported in the proposed rule. The 
commenter stated that this makes the 
other species estimates, impacts, and 
information in the draft very 
questionable. The commenter further 
states that there should be no 
harassment or takes of the Eastern North 
Pacific gray whales, nor the Southern 
Resident killer whales, nor other 
endangered or threatened species. 
The commenter also stated that more 
research is needed on the unknown 
impacts to multiple species of which the 
proposed rule proposed to authorize 
take, particularly research on new 
technologies, impulsive and continuous 
sonar broadcast, and uncrewed sea craft. 
Response: The 2023 Pacific SAR indicates the Eastern North Pacific stock 
of gray whales is increasing and has an 
abundance of 26,960 animals. However, 
recent (2024–2025) surveys conducted 
by NMFS’ Southwest Fisheries Science 
Center (SWFSC) indicated that the 
estimated total abundance of gray 
whales during the 2024–2025 
southbound migration was 12,950 
(Eguchi et al., 2025). NMFS has updated its analysis to consider both abundance 
estimates, and has determined the 
authorized take of the Eastern North 
Pacific stock of gray whale will have a 
negligible impact on the stock, 
including in consideration of the Eguchi 
et al. (2025) estimate. As described in 
the Analysis and Negligible Impact 
Determination section, this stock is not 
listed under the ESA and is not 
considered as depleted or strategic 
under the MMPA and there are no 
UMEs or other for this stock. Any takes 
in the form of TTS are expected to be 
lower-level, of short duration (from 
minutes to, at most, several hours or less 
than a day), and mostly not in a 
frequency band that would be expected 
to interfere with gray whale 
communication or other important low- 
frequency cues. Any associated lost 
opportunities or capabilities individuals 
might experience as a result of TTS 
would not be at a level or duration that 
would be expected to impact 
reproductive success or survival. For 
similar reasons, while auditory injury 
impacts last longer, the low anticipated 
levels of AUD INJ that could be 
reasonably expected to result from these 
activities are unlikely to have any effect 
on fitness. 
Regarding the likely severity of any 
single instance of take by behavioral 
disturbance, as described above, the 
majority of the predicted exposures are 
expected to be below 172 dB SPL and 
last from a few minutes to a few hours, 
at most, with associated responses most 
likely in the form of moving away from 
the source, foraging interruptions, 
vocalization changes, or disruption of 
other social behaviors, lasting from a 
few minutes to several hours. Gray 
whales are large-bodied capital breeders 
with a slow pace of life and are 
therefore generally less susceptible to 
impacts from shorter duration foraging 
disruptions. Further, as described in the 
Group and Species-Specific Analyses 
section and the Mitigation Measures 
section, mitigation measures are 
expected to further reduce the potential 
severity of impacts through real-time 
operational measures that minimize 
higher level/longer duration exposures

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258821 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations and time/area measures that reduce 
impacts in high value habitat. 
Given the number of takes by 
harassment as compared to the stock/ 
species abundance (see table 54), and 
the fact that a portion of the takes of the 
Eastern North Pacific occur in BIAs, it 
is likely that some portion of the 
individuals taken are taken repeatedly 
over a limited number of days. 
However, given the variety of activity 
types that contribute to take across 
separate exercises conducted at different 
times and in different areas, and the fact 
that many result from transient 
activities conducted at sea, it is unlikely 
that repeated takes would occur either 
in numbers across sequential days in a 
manner likely to impact foraging 
success and energetics or other 
behaviors such that reproduction or 
survival of any individuals is likely to 
be impacted. 
Given the status of the stock and in 
consideration of other ongoing 
anthropogenic mortality (fisheries 
interactions, vessel strike), the 
authorized M/SI (three over the course 
of the 7-year rule, or 0.43 annually) will 
not, alone, nor in combination with the 
impacts of the take by harassment 
discussed above (which is not expected 
to impact the reproduction or survival 
of any individuals), be expected to 
adversely affect rates of recruitment and 
survival for any of this stock. 
NMFS did not propose to authorize 
take of southern resident killer whale 
(90 FR 32118, July 16, 2025), and this 
final rule does not authorize take of that 
stock. This rule does, however, 
authorize take of certain species that are 
listed as threatened or endangered 
under the ESA, as indicated in table 1. 
The MMPA provides for the 
authorization of incidental take caused 
by specified activities at the request of 
an applicant, provided certain findings 
are made. The law directs NMFS to 
process adequate and complete 
applications for incidental take 
authorization, and issue the 
authorization provided all statutory 
findings and requirements, as well as all 
associated legal requirements, are met. 
As described in the Analysis and 
Negligible Impact Determination 
section, based on the analysis contained 
herein of the likely effects of the 
specified activities on marine mammals 
and their habitat, and taking into 
consideration the implementation of the 
proposed monitoring and mitigation 
measures, NMFS finds that the total 
marine mammal take from the specified 
activity will have a negligible impact on 
all affected marine mammal species or 
stocks. 
On September 16, 2024, NMFS 
received an application from the Action 
Proponents requesting authorization to 
take marine mammals incidental to 
training, testing, and modernization and 
sustainment of ranges (characterized as 
military readiness activities) within the 
HCTT Study Area. In response to our 
comments and following an information 
exchange, the Action Proponents 
submitted a revised application, deemed 
adequate and complete on December 13, 
2024. NMFS, following its own analysis 
and proposed rule, has determined it is 
appropriate to promulgate a final rule 
and LOAs pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 
1371(a)(5)(A) and 50 CFR 216.105. 
Regarding the commenter’s assertion 
that more research is needed on the 
unknown impacts to multiple species of 
which the proposed rule proposed to 
authorize take, particularly research on 
new technologies, impulsive and 
continuous sonar broadcast, and 
uncrewed sea craft, this final rule 
requires the Action Proponents to 
conduct all monitoring and reporting 
required under the LOAs, including 
abiding by the HCTT Study Area 
monitoring program. Details on program 
goals, objectives, project selection 
process, and current projects are 
available at https://
www.navymarinespeciesmonitoring.us. 
The commenter appears to imply that 
NMFS should not authorize take of 
marine mammals prior to completion of 
the research it states is needed. 
However, as stated in the Legal 
Authority for the Final Action section of 
this final rule, an authorization for 
incidental takings shall be granted if 
NMFS finds that the taking will have a 
negligible impact on the species or 
stocks and will not have an unmitigable 
adverse impact on the availability of the 
species or stocks for taking for 
subsistence uses (where relevant) (16 
U.S.C. 1371(a)(5)(A)). Further, NMFS 
must prescribe the permissible methods 
of taking and other means of effecting 
the least practicable adverse impact on 
the affected species or stocks and their 
habitat, paying particular attention to 
rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of 
similar significance, and on the 
availability of such species or stocks for 
taking for certain subsistence uses 
(referred to in this rule as ‘‘mitigation 
measures’’); and requirements 
pertaining to the monitoring and 
reporting of such takings (16 U.S.C. 
1371(a)(5)(A)). NMFS has made the 
required findings, and therefore, it must 
issue the requested incidental take 
authorization to the Navy. 
Comment 17 (32–3): A commenter 
recommended that NMFS integrate 
Indigenous and local ecological 
knowledge into baseline data collection 
and cumulative impact assessments. In 
a related comment, the commenter 
stated the proposed rule evaluates 
impacts primarily from the military 
readiness activities themselves but does 
not meaningfully incorporate the 
cumulative effects of commercial 
shipping, climate change-driven habitat 
shifts, and prior authorization of 
incidental take in the same region. 
Response: It is unclear what the commenter is referring to regarding 
baseline data collection, and the 
commenter has not identified, with any 
degree of specificity, which Indigenous 
or local ecological knowledge it 
recommends NMFS consider. 
The MMPA requires that NMFS issue 
an incidental take authorization, 
provided the necessary findings are 
made for the specified activity put forth 
in the application and appropriate 
mitigation and monitoring measures are 
set forth, as described in the Legal 
Authority for the Final Action section of 
this rule. As described in the proposed 
rule (90 FR 32118, July 16, 2025) and 
this final rule, the preamble for NMFS’ 
implementing regulations under section 
101(a)(5) (54 FR 40338, September 29, 
1989) explains in response to comments 
that the impacts from other past and 
ongoing anthropogenic activities are 
incorporated into the negligible impact 
analysis via their impacts on the 
environmental baseline. Consistent with 
that direction, NMFS has factored into 
its negligible impact analyses the 
impacts of other past and ongoing 
anthropogenic activities via their 
impacts on the baseline (e.g., as reflected in the density/distribution and 
status of the species, population size 
and growth rate, and other relevant 
stressors (such as UMEs)). See the 
Analysis and Negligible Impact 
Determination section of this rule. 
Our 1989 final rule for the MMPA 
implementing regulations also 
addressed how cumulative effects from 
unrelated activities would be 
considered. There we stated that such 
effects are not separately considered in 
making findings under section 101(a)(5) 
concerning negligible impact, but that 
NMFS would consider cumulative 
effects that are reasonably foreseeable 
when preparing a NEPA analysis and 
also that reasonably foreseeable 
cumulative effects would be considered 
under section 7 of the ESA for ESA- 
listed species. 
The cumulative effects of the 
incremental impact of the proposed 
action when added to other past, 
present, and reasonably foreseeable 
future actions (as well as the effects of 
ocean pollution and ecosystem

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258822 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations alteration trends; see Table 4–2) were 
evaluated against the appropriate 
resources and regulatory baselines in 
the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS. The best 
available science and a comprehensive 
review of past, present, and reasonably 
foreseeable actions (including 
commercial shipping, ecosystem 
alteration trends, and other activities for 
which incidental take of marine 
mammals may occur) was used to 
develop the Cumulative Impacts 
analysis. This analysis is contained in 
chapter 4 of the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS. 
As required under NEPA, the level and 
scope of the analysis is commensurate 
with the scope of potential impacts of 
the action and the extent and character 
of the potentially-impacted resources 
(e.g., the geographic boundaries for cumulative impacts analysis for some 
resources are expanded to include 
activities outside the HCTT Study Area 
that might impact migratory or wide- 
ranging animals), as reflected in the 
resource-specific discussions in chapter 
3 (Affected Environment and 
Environmental Consequences) of the 
2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS. The 2025 HCTT 
EIS/OEIS considered the proposed 
training activities alongside other 
actions in the region whose impacts 
may be additive to those of the proposed 
training. Past and present actions are 
also included in the analytical process 
as part of the affected environmental 
baseline conditions presented in chapter 
3 of the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS. 
Further, cumulative effects to listed 
species of the specified activity in 
combination with other activities are 
analyzed in the ESA biological opinion. 
This analysis is contained in section 7 
(Cumulative Effects). The opinion states 
that it assumes effects in the future 
would be similar to those in the past 
and, therefore, are reflected in the 
anticipated trends described in the 
Species and Designated Critical Habitat 
that May be Affected and Environmental 
Baseline sections of the biological 
opinion (sections 4 and 5, respectively). 
Marine Mammal Densities 
Comment 18 (ref 1): The Commission 
recommended that NMFS use an 
abundance estimate of 72,631 rather 
than 48,780 for April-June and 63,850 
rather than 43,360 for July-March, along 
with a 75 percent assumption for the 
core area and 30 percent assumption for 
the geographic area to revise the density 
estimates and resulting numbers of takes 
of Guadalupe fur seals for the final rule. 
Response: Jua´rez-Ruiz et al. (2022) revised abundance estimate became 
available after the densities were 
derived for the Navy’s acoustic and 
explosive impact modeling. The Navy 
worked with one of the co-authors on 
the paper by Jua´rez-Ruiz et al. (2022) to develop the density estimates used in 
the analysis, which included identifying 
the most appropriate abundance 
estimate for Guadalupe fur seal. 
During the process of calculating 
pinniped densities for the pending 
Northwest Training and Testing Phase 
IV Supplemental EIS/OEIS Study Area, 
The Marine Mammal Center reported to 
the Navy a revised unpublished 
abundance for Guadalupe fur seals of 
96,468. Considering that this is a two- 
fold increase in the abundance estimate 
used to derive densities, the Navy 
decided that the Guadalupe fur seal 
densities should be revised and take 
estimates recalculated based on the 
adjusted densities. Since there are only 
two uniform density strata for 
Guadalupe fur seal, the Navy 
determined that remodeling to estimate 
takes would not be necessary and that 
the increase in takes can be estimated by 
calculating a multiplier equal to the 
ratio between the initial and 
recalculated densities. Two multipliers 
were calculated and used to revise take 
estimates: (1) a warm season multiplier 
of 2.07945; and (2) a cold season 
multiplier of 2.05908. This was a 
reasonable approach given that 
remodeling is not feasible at this point 
because exposure estimates from 
previous analyses in at-sea study areas 
have shown that changes in densities 
result in approximately proportional 
changes in predicted exposures. The 
‘‘U.S. Navy Marine Species Density 
Database Phase IV for the Hawaii- 
California Training and Testing Study 
Area’’ (U.S. Department of the Navy, 
2024b), hereafter referred to as the 
Density Technical Report, was amended 
with the revised densities in September 
2025 and is hereafter referred to as the 
revised Density Technical Report (U.S. 
Department of the Navy, 2025b), and 
NMFS concurs with that revision. The 
HCTT proposed rule and this final rule 
include the resulting take numbers. 
Comment 19 (ref 2): The Commission 
recommended that NMFS use the monk 
seal abundance estimates from the 2022 
SAR to derive its density estimates and 
re-estimate the numbers of takes for the 
final rule. 
Response: The abundance of 1,437 monk seals published in the 2021 SAR 
(Carretta et al., 2022) was the latest abundance estimate available when the 
Navy calculated densities. The 2022 
SAR (Carretta et al., 2023b) was 
published in August 2023, over 1 year 
after densities were finalized. 
The Navy revised the density 
estimates for Hawaiian monk seal using 
the latest abundance estimates reported 
in the 2024 draft SAR (Carretta et al., in 
review) for each island where separate 
abundances were reported. The total 
abundance reported by Carretta et al. (in 
review) is 1,605 monk seals. In order to 
account for the increase in total 
abundance, the Navy calculated 
multipliers for each island by taking the 
ratio of the revised and initial densities. 
An analysis of the acoustic effects 
modeling results showed that all 
predicted exposures of Hawaiian monk 
seals occurred in the Main Hawaiian 
Islands (MHI) and no exposures 
occurred in the Northwestern Hawaiian 
Islands. Therefore, the Navy used the 
highest multiplier derived for the MHI 
of 1.2919 to increase the estimated takes 
in waters both greater than and less than 
200 m. NMFS concurs with this method. 
Comment 20 (ref 3): The Commission 
recommended that NMFS: (1) revise the 
elephant seal density estimates by 
increasing the (a) in-water percentage of 
females from 0–25 percent for May and 
June, (b) percentage of females off 
California from 80–100 percent for 
January, February, and May, (c) in-water 
percentage of males from 0–25 percent 
for August, and (d) percentage of 
females off California in September and 
October from 5 percent and males off 
California in April, May, June, and 
October from 0–10 percent to the 
percentage of the population expected 
to be comprised of yearlings and 
juveniles and the sex-based ratios 
provided in table 9–12 of the Density 
Technical Report; and (2) re-estimate 
the numbers of takes accordingly for the 
final rule. The Commission stated that 
these revisions are particularly 
important, because NMFS relies on the 
Navy’s density estimates for authorizing 
the taking associated with many other 
activities off California and will do so 
for at least the next 7 years until the 
Phase V densities are available. 
Response: The Navy used the kernel density distribution areas shown in 
figure 4 in Robinson et al. (2012) to 
approximate the spatial strata to use in 
density calculations. The Navy 
recognized that the data in Figure 4 
indicated a higher relative density of 
female elephant seals off California in 
May and June; however, that is the time 
during which females return to natal 
rookeries and are hauled out molting 
and fasting and not expected to spend 
much, if any, time in the water. The sex 
and age class haulout behavior of 
northern elephant seals is complex and 
difficult to represent in this type of 
calculation where some portion of seals 
of each age and sex class is hauled out 
at different but overlapping time periods 
that span partial months. For 7 months 
(males) or 8 months (females) out of the 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  19:02 Dec 16, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\17DER2.SGM 17DER2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258823 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations year, the Navy assumes 100 percent of 
seals are in the water, which is 
undoubtedly an overestimate 
considering that seals are known to 
haulout during foraging periods. While 
the Navy strives to improve density 
estimates to accurately represent 
pinniped haulout behavior, the level of 
precision is limited by both the 
available and sometimes conflicting 
data on species’ behavior and the large 
scale of the study area over which 
behavior may vary. The assumptions 
made for the purposes of calculating 
monthly densities at this scale were 
reasonable and generally representative 
of the species behavior. 
While the majority of tagged elephant 
seals reported by Robinson et al. (2012) 
were from An˜o Nuevo Island, a few 
were tagged on Islas San Benito, Mexico 
and followed similar migration patterns. 
Seals from all other breeding and 
haulout sites are expected to follow 
similar migration patterns (i.e., move north or northwest after breeding and 
molting periods) and to follow similar 
annual breeding and molting haulout 
cycles. For females, this means hauling 
out to molt in May and June and 
spending little to no time in the water. 
Again, the information in Robinson et 
al. (2012) was primarily used to define strata for calculating densities. It’s clear 
from Robinson et al. (2012) figure 4 that 
100 percent of females do not occur off 
CA in January, February, and May; the 
Navy considers 80 percent to be a 
reasonable estimate. It’s not clear how 
the Commission determined that 10 
percent instead of 5 percent of females 
would be off California in September 
and October. While the density 
estimates do not distinguish abundance 
by age class, the entire population 
abundance is used in the calculations, 
which includes all age classes. 
Furthermore, the analyzed abundance 
of elephant seals includes 22,000 seals 
from the Mexico breeding population (a 
likely overestimate for that declining 
population as noted in the Density 
Technical Report and revised Density 
Technical Report and exceeds the 
abundance of the California breeding 
stock managed by NMFS. This 
conservative abundance estimate puts 
more seals in the water during the 
majority of the year and likely inflates 
predicted exposure estimates. 
Lastly, the majority of sonar and 
explosive use occurs in the SOCAL 
Range Complex located south of the 
elephant seal at-sea distribution 
following both the post-breeding and 
post-molting migrations, which extend 
north and northwest of the Channel 
Islands and into the North Pacific. 
As such, the Navy has not revised the 
density estimates as recommended by 
the Commission. NMFS concurs, and 
has not revised the number of estimated 
takes of this stock. 
Comment 21 (ref 4, 5): The 
Commission recommended that NMFS: 
(1) revise the harbor seal density 
estimates by using (a) the 2.86 
correction factor from Harvey and Goley 
(2011) rather than 2.44 for the Channel 
Islands and 1.15 for Point Mugu and La 
Jolla to estimate the total abundances at 
the various locations in Table 9–21 of 
Density Technical Report, (b) the 65 
percent in-water percentage from 
Harvey and Goley (2011) for Point 
Mugu, La Jolla, and all of the Channel 
Islands except for San Nicolas and San 
Miguel Islands for the entire year, and 
(c) 40 km from shore from Calambokidis 
(2004) and the 200-m isobath based on 
Stewart and Yochem (1994) rather than 
20 km from shore and the 120-m isobath 
as stratum demarcations for areas where 
harbor seals could occur; and (2) re- 
estimate the numbers of takes 
accordingly for the final rule. 
The Commission further 
recommended that NMFS: (1) contact 
the SWFSC to obtain the maximum 
harbor seal abundance estimate from 
Santa Catalina Island during which the 
relevant haul-out sites were surveyed 
and use the 2.86 correction factor to 
estimate the total abundance at Santa 
Catalina Island; (2) estimate the total 
abundance of harbor seals from La Jolla 
to Point Mugu and from Point Mugu 
around past Pt. Conception based on the 
number of harbor seals of the 30,968 
abundance estimate for the California 
stock from Harvey and Goley (2011) that 
remains after subtracting the Channel 
Islands, Point Mugu, and La Jolla 
abundance estimates; (3) use the 65 
percent in-water percentage from 
Harvey and Goley (2011), 40 km from 
shore from Calambokidis (2004), and the 
200-m isobath based on Stewart and 
Yochem (1994) to estimate the harbor 
seal density for Santa Catalina Island, 
from La Jolla to Point Mugu, and from 
Point Mugu around past Pt. Conception; 
and (4) re-estimate the numbers of takes 
accordingly for the final rule. 
Response: Regarding the Commission’s recommendation to use 
the 2.86 correction factor from Harvey 
and Goley (2011), the correction factor 
for San Nicolas Island from Stewart and 
Yochem (1983) of 59 percent in-water is 
the most appropriate haulout factor (i.e., 
with one exception it is the highest 
percentage of seals in the water) 
compared with other available haulout 
factors. Harvey and Goley (2011) 
recommend a factor of 1.54 (or 35 
percent in water) for all of California. A 
factor of 2.86 (65 percent in-water) for 
southern California was also reported by 
the authors, but was based only on one 
survey, so the authors recommended 
using the mean of 1.54 (35 percent in- 
water) for California over the 2.86 factor. 
Note that the authors describe the single 
survey from southern California as ‘‘a 
poor sample estimate of the proportion 
ashore.’’ The Navy used 2.44 (59 percent 
in-water), which is higher than most 
other factors including all three of the 
mean haulout factors derived by Harvey 
and Goley (2011) (see table 2 in the 
paper), which would also have been 
reasonable alternatives. 
Haulout factors were also chosen to be 
specific to season (breeding/molting vs. 
non-breeding/molting) as well as 
location where data were available. The 
survey data reported by Lowry et al. 
(2021) that were used to estimate 
abundances and densities were 
conducted in summer, so Navy used the 
most conservative haulout factor for 
summer (59 percent in-water) from 
Stewart and Yochem (1983) for the in- 
water abundance estimate, and NMFS 
concurs. 
The 87 percent ashore estimate was a 
typo in the Navy’s 2024 Marine Species 
Density Database (NMSDD) which has 
been superseded by the revised Density 
Technical Report. It should have been 
83 percent ashore equating to 17 percent 
in-water, as shown in table 9–20 in the 
revised Density Technical Report. The 
factor of 1.2 or 17 percent in-water is 
from table 1 in Huber et al. (2001) which 
cites the source as Hanan (1996), a Ph.D. 
dissertation. The Navy corrected the 
typo in the revised Density Technical 
Report. The Navy selected the 1.2 
haulout factor for the two mainland 
locations in Southern California because 
several of the sites used in the research 
were located along the mainland coast 
and the Navy sought out correction 
factors specific to seals along the 
mainland, and NMFS concurs with this 
approach. 
Below table 9–25 in the revised 
Density Technical Report, the following 
text states which correction factor was 
used for the September–February time 
period, ‘‘For the September through 
February time period, the in-water 
abundance was estimated as 86 percent 
of the total abundance, based on data 
from San Miguel Island reported by 
Yochem et al. (1987) and included in a summary by Huber et al. (2001).’’ Table 
9–24 shows an in-water percentage 
range of 81–86 percent; the Navy 
selected 86 percent in-water as a more 
conservative approach. NMFS concurs 
with this decision. 
The Navy used the 59 percent in- 
water factor for March through August

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258824 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations for all Channel Islands except for San 
Miguel Island, which used 23 percent 
based on a tagging study conducted 
with seals on the island, and NMFS 
concurs. 
As a conservative measure, the Navy 
used the highest counts from 2016 to 
2019 by Lowry et al. (2021) to estimate 
in-water abundances instead of using a 
multi-year average or counts from the 
most recent year (i.e., 2019) (refer to table 9–25 in the revised Density 
Technical Report). Both alternative 
options would have been reasonable to 
select, but instead the Navy chose to use 
the maximum count over the 4 year 
survey period. Note that the maximum 
counts for six of the eight islands 
occurred in 2016 (the other two 
occurred in 2019), suggesting that the 
overall harbor seal abundance in the 
Channel Islands may be declining and 
that the Navy’s density estimates may be 
high for predicting takes beyond the 
year 2019. NMFS concurs with this 
approach. 
Regarding the strata, harbor seals are 
well known for remaining close to 
haulouts and foraging in relatively 
shallow waters, as documented in the 
half dozen sources cited on page 237 of 
the revised Density Technical Report. 
The sources also demonstrate that while 
habitat use is generally similar in 
multiple regions, there is variability in 
the depth and distance from shore 
characteristics of harbor seal 
distribution in various studies. The 
Navy reviewed the sources and 
attempted to define strata that captured 
the general and expected distribution of 
the species. Expanding strata farther 
offshore into deeper waters to capture 
extralimital and infrequent excursions 
by individual seals (as recommended by 
the Commission) would have the effect 
of reducing the density in the nearshore 
habitat where harbor seals 
predominantly occur. Stewart and 
Yochem (1994) reported the 20 km 
distance-from-shore metric used in the 
analysis. The 120 m depth contour used 
to define strata encompassed the vast 
majority of reported foraging depths 
without expanding the strata farther 
offshore (e.g., to the 200 m depth contour representing the shelf break as 
the Commission recommended) and 
reducing the densities. The density 
estimates are intended to represent the 
predominant occurrence and 
distribution of the population rather 
than capture all possible areas where 
wide-ranging individuals have been 
sighted. The Channel Islands are part of 
the Continental Borderland region in the 
Southern California Bight which 
exhibits a complex bathymetry without 
a clearly distinct shelf break. While the 
shelf break (often represented by the 200 
m depth contour) is a reasonable 
boundary to choose in more 
conventional continental margins, it 
does not accurately demarcate the shelf 
break in the Southern California Bight. 
As noted above, the harbor seal 
abundances were based on counts 
reported by Lowry et al. (2021), which 
reported eight harbor seals off Santa 
Catalina island in 2019 only; no counts 
were reported in 2016 through 2018. 
Using a haulout factor of 59 percent 
results in a total abundance of 20 seals 
associated with the island and in-water 
abundance estimates of 12 seals 
(March–August) and 17 seals 
(September–February). The area around 
Santa Catalina Island extending from 
shore to the 120 m isobath is 
approximately 42,205 square kilometers 
(km
2
), which results in densities of 
0.0003 to 0.0004 seals/km
2
for March– 
August and September–February, 
respectively. The densities are about 
three orders of magnitude lower than 
densities around the other islands 
where the Navy conducts more 
activities (e.g., San Nicolas, San Miguel, San Clemente). Based on these factors, 
the Navy has determined that adding a 
density for Santa Catalina Island and 
remodeling would not contribute 
substantively, if at all, to the current 
take estimates, and NMFS concurs. 
The Navy worked with scientists from 
the NMFS SWFSC to derive the 
pinniped density estimates, including 
estimates for harbor seals. There is a 
lack of survey data between La Jolla and 
Point Mugu along the mainland coast, 
which is why densities are not provided 
along that part of the coast. It is also 
noteworthy that the majority of training 
and testing activities using sonar and 
other transducers or explosives would 
occur beyond 12 nmi (22.2 km) from 
shore along the mainland coast. The 
adjacent warning area (W–291) begins 
approximately 12 nmi (22.2 km) from 
shore along the coast between La Jolla 
and Point Mugu. Therefore, any harbor 
seals occurring along the coast in this 
area are unlikely to be affected, and 
calculating the density using the 
method suggested by the Commission is 
not warranted. 
Calambokidis et al. (2004) reported harbor seal sightings off the Washington 
coast from 1995 to 2002. While not as 
relevant to more recently reported 
harbor seal behavior off California, the 
authors reported a mean depth for the 
15 sightings of 102 m and a mean 
distance from shore of 15.5 km, which 
further supports the Navy’s decision to 
use the 120 m depth contour and a 
distance of 20 km from shore to define 
the strata used in the Navy’s HCTT 
density estimates rather than greater 
depths and distances from shore 
recommended by the Commission. 
Given that the densities remain 
unchanged, re-estimating the number of 
takes for this final rule was not required. 
Comment 22 (6, 7): The Commission 
recommended that NMFS work with the 
Navy to derive harbor seal and 
bottlenose dolphin density estimates for 
both within San Diego Bay and the 
SSTC area based on sightings data from 
the numerous monitoring reports 
available, while also considering the 
area beyond the Coronado Bridge in San 
Diego Bay. 
Response: The Navy has derived densities for bottlenose dolphin for the 
SSTC, located south of the entrance to 
San Diego Bay (see figure 6–53 in the 
Density Technical Report). The Navy 
recognizes that in addition to the 
regularly occurring California sea lion, 
other marine mammal species, such as 
harbor seal and common bottlenose 
dolphin occasionally enter San Diego 
Bay; however, those species tend to 
remain near the mouth of the Bay, with 
only a few moving farther into the Bay. 
The planned activities involving in- 
water sound sources within San Diego 
Bay occur well into the Bay, typically 
south of the Coronado Bridge, and do 
not include pile driving. The monitoring 
report for the Naval Base Point Loma 
Pier 302 Replacement Project (available 
at https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/ action/incidental-take-authorization- 
naval-base-point-loma-pier-302- 
replacement-project) cited by the 
Commission reported observation of 1 
bottlenose dolphin and 13 harbor seals 
over 181 observer hours. It is not 
unusual for individuals of both species 
that occur in nearshore waters to be 
sighted at the mouth of San Diego Bay 
near Point Loma. The Naval Base San 
Diego (NBSD) Pier 6 Replacement 
Project monitoring report (available at 
https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/action/ 
incidental-take-authorization-naval- 
base-san-diego-pier-6-replacement- 
project-san-diego) recorded species 
during two IHA periods over 
approximately 15 months (October 
2021–January 2023). Only two harbor 
seals were observed over 450 
monitoring days under the first IHA and 
no harbor seals were observed over 88 
monitoring days under the second IHA. 
These few observations are not 
indicative of regular occurrence in the 
central or southern part of San Diego 
Bay and do not support the need for a 
density estimate in San Diego Bay. 
The report also shows 86 bottlenose 
dolphin observations under the first 
IHA and 0 bottlenose dolphin 
observations under the second IHA

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258825 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations (table 3–3). The report qualifies the total 
number of observations by quantifying 
re-sightings in table 3–5 (i.e., sightings of the same individual multiple times 
based on identifiable markings on dorsal 
fins (e.g., cuts, scrapes, shape, etc.)). The data indicate approximately 72 percent 
of individuals observed were resights. 
Table 3–12 in the report shows that 
bottlenose dolphins were only sighted 
in January, February, and March of 2022 
and were not sighted during any other 
month. Monitoring also occurred in 
January 2023 with zero bottlenose 
dolphin observations; however, no 
monitoring occurred in February or 
March of 2023. It is possible that the 
occurrence in San Diego Bay from 
January to March of 2022 was an 
anomaly; the report noted that 
bottlenose dolphins were not expected 
to occur in San Diego Bay at all. 
Observer bias may have also contributed 
to the increased sightings, as noted in 
section 3.2.2 of the report, which 
discussed a similar trend in 
observations of California sea lions. 
The Commission references 15 IHAs 
issued to the Navy in the last decade, 
but aside from the two noted above, the 
Commission does not clearly state 
which other projects are referenced. The 
non-systematic observations reported in 
the monitoring reports mentioned 
previously do not support robust 
density estimates for San Diego Bay. 
Additional data would be required to 
better quantify abundance and seasonal 
occurrence in the bay to support a 
density estimate. 
Therefore, given their occasional 
presence and the limitations of the 
observational data, the Navy did not 
develop density estimates for harbor 
seal and bottlenose dolphin specific to 
San Diego Bay for the HCTT EIS/OEIS, 
and NMFS concurs such density 
estimates are not necessary. 
Comment 23 (ref 8): The Commission 
recommended that NMFS work with the 
Navy to derive the California sea lion 
density estimates south of the Coronado 
Bridge based on sightings data from the 
numerous monitoring reports rather 
than Graham and Saunders (2015). 
Response: While the observations of California sea lions during pier 
replacement activities at NBSD confirm 
the presence of sea lions south of the 
Coronado Bridge, the observations were 
not based on line transect surveys 
unlike the data reported by Graham and 
Saunders (2015). Naval Facilities 
Engineering Command Southwest 
(2024) reported 237 observations over 
493 monitor days, or 0.48 animals per 
day, and also acknowledged that the 
observations included repeat sightings 
(approximately 26 percent of 
individuals), making the data less useful 
for estimating densities. As with the 
bottlenose dolphin sightings, the report 
noted that sightings of California sea 
lions increased substantially in January, 
February, and March of 2022, and the 
increase was likely due to the presence 
of additional observers. This suggests a 
bias in the data that limits its usefulness 
for deriving densities representative of 
species distribution and occurrence. 
These non-systematic observations 
reported in both in the Naval Facilities 
Engineering Command Southwest 
(2024) monitoring report do not support 
robust density estimates for south and 
central San Diego Bay. Additional data 
would be required to better quantify 
abundance and seasonal occurrence in 
the bay to support a density estimate. 
Furthermore, the proposed military 
readiness activities in San Diego Bay do 
not include pile driving or other sound- 
producing activities that would require 
a density for analysis. 
Comment 24 (ref 9): The Commission 
noted the following points related to the 
pinniped densities provided in the 
Density Technical Report. The 
Commission recommended that NMFS 
work with the Navy to revise the 
Density Technical Report to clarify and 
address these points since the densities 
will inform the numbers of takes for the 
final rule and other incidental take 
authorizations for activities conducted 
by the Navy and other applicants. 
€The Navy stated that, on average, post-partum female northern fur seals 
spent 180 hours in the water for every 
40 hours on land, equating to 78 percent 
of time in the water, which equated to 
78 percent of adult females being in the 
water from June through November. The 
in-water percentage would be 82 rather 
than 78 percent. 
€The Navy incorrectly identified the various in-water percentages for 
California sea lions in Table 9–25 as 
haul-out correction factors in the table 
heading and underlying text. The 
heading and text should indicate that 
those are indeed in-water percentages, 
similar to table 9–20 for harbor seals. 
€The Navy did not include the California sea lion juveniles and pups 
specified in table 9–25 in the non- 
breeding season abundance estimate for 
the California breeding strata. Juveniles 
and pups should be included in the 
abundance estimate as was done for the 
breeding season density. 
€The Navy specified that the in- water percentages for Steller sea lions 
were correction factors for estimation of 
the in-water abundances. The 
percentages should be specified as in- 
water percentages rather than correction 
factors, similar to harbor seals. 
Response: Regarding the Commission’s first point, Antonelis et 
al. (1990) states that the average foraging trip was 180.6 hours (standard deviation 
(SD) = 37 hours) and the average time 
on land was 39.6 hours (SD = 10 hours). 
The Navy interpreted that as a ratio of 
40 hours on land to 180 hours in water 
or 40:180 = 40/180 = 22 percent on land 
(78 percent in water). The Navy 
acknowledges a different interpretation 
of the source is reasonable, but notes 
that any difference in the resulting 
percentages (78 percent vs. 82 percent) 
is within the range of the SD in both 
measurements. As such, the Navy has 
not adjusted the percentage, and NMFS 
concurs no adjustment is warranted. 
Regarding the Commission’s second 
and fourth points, the Navy changed the 
heading on table 9–25 in the Density 
Technical Report and adjusted related 
text on correction factors in the sections 
on California sea lions and Steller sea 
lions and in the revised Density 
Technical Report. NMFS concurs with 
this change. 
Regarding the Commission’s third 
point, the abundance estimate used to 
calculate densities for the non-breeding 
season was based on the total stock 
abundance and therefore considered all 
lifestages, even though they were not 
specifically called out in the 
calculation. The in-water percentages 
reported in table 9–25 were based on 
data on haulout behavior for each 
lifestage, but not all percentages were 
used to calculate densities. For example, 
for the non-breeding season female pups 
were effectively assigned the in-water 
percentage of 75 percent characteristic 
of adult females, but used for all 
females, rather than the 34 percent in- 
water percentage representing pup 
haulout behavior. Using this approach 
helped to simplify the calculation 
somewhat but also resulted in a more 
conservative density estimate. Also, the 
abundance used was based on data 
reported by Herna´ndez-Camacho et al. (2021) and exceeded the current 
abundance for the California Stock 
reported in the SAR. As such, no change 
is warranted.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258826 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations requirements included in the proposed 
rule and this final rule considered the 
current science regarding behavioral 
response, as well as practicability for 
implementation. The practicability 
assessment criteria are described in 
table 5–1 of the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS. 
Comment 26 (ref 33): A commenter 
stated that for mitigation areas to 
effectively protect marine mammals 
they must be properly sited, and the 
management objectives for each 
mitigation area must be based on best 
available scientific information. The 
commenter stated, when uncertainty 
exists and options are proposed that risk 
overprotection or underprotection, the 
MMPA requires the permitting agency 
to consider ‘‘whether the precautionary 
approach would give more protection to 
marine mammals, and then whether that 
protection would impede military 
training to a degree making that 
mitigation not practicable.’’ Natural 
Resources Defense Council v. Pritzker, 828 F.3d 1125, 1138 (9th Cir. 2016). The 
commenter stated that the final 
rulemaking should reflect that 
consideration to the extent that NMFS 
intends to adopt it for purposes of 
MMPA authorization. 
Response: NMFS concurs that for mitigation areas to effectively protect 
marine mammals, they must be properly 
sited and management objectives for 
each must be based on best available 
scientific information. A full technical 
analysis of the mitigation areas is 
provided in appendix K (Geographic 
Mitigation Assessment) of the 2025 
HCTT EIS/OEIS. A complete discussion 
of the Action Proponents’ evaluation 
process used to develop, assess, and 
select mitigation measures, can also be 
found in chapter 5 (Mitigation) of the 
2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS. NMFS has 
reviewed the information contained 
therein and finds that it reflects the best 
available science. Supporting 
documents include peer-reviewed 
articles; scientific committee reports; 
cruise reports or transects; books, 
government reports, or non- 
governmental organization (NGO) 
reports; and notes, abstracts, and 
conference proceedings. NMFS 
independently analyzed the mitigation 
areas and found these geographic 
mitigation areas are both practicable and 
will reduce the likelihood, magnitude, 
or severity of adverse impacts to marine 
mammals or their habitat in the manner 
described in the Action Proponents’ 
analysis and this rule. 
We acknowledge that the Ninth 
Circuit opinion stated that NMFS 
‘‘should have considered whether ‘the 
precautionary approach’ would give 
more protection to marine mammals, 
and then whether that protection would 
impede military training to a degree 
making that mitigation not practicable.’’ 
Pritzker, 828 F.3d at 1138. However, taken in the context of the Court’s full 
discussion, we read the Ninth Circuit’s 
use of the term ‘‘the precautionary 
approach’’ as specifically referring to 
the recommendations in the White 
Paper for designating Offshore 
Biologically Important Areas (OBIAs) in 
‘‘data-poor’’ regions of the ocean 
(described therein as a precautionary 
approach for designating OBIAs), rather 
than a broader mandate to adopt a 
‘‘precautionary approach’’ in carrying 
out the requirements of the MMPA. 
Accordingly, we disagree with the 
commenter’s interpretation of the 
MMPA and Pritzker case. As we explained in the preamble of our 2019 
incidental take regulations for 
Surveillance Towed Array Sensor 
System LFA training and testing in the 
North Pacific Ocean and Eastern Indian 
Ocean (84 FR 40132, August 13, 2019), 
NMFS’ interpretation of the Ninth 
Circuit’s opinion is based on the fact 
that neither the MMPA, 16 U.S.C. 1361 
et seq., nor NMFS’ implementing 
regulations, 50 CFR part 216, subpart I, 
include express references to, or 
requirements for, the precautionary 
approach, nor is there a clear, agreed- 
upon description of what the 
precautionary approach is or would 
entail in the context of the MMPA or 
any specific activity. 
The MMPA by nature is inherently 
protective, including the requirement to 
mitigate to the lowest level practicable 
(‘‘least’’ practicable adverse impacts, or 
‘‘LPAI,’’ on species or stocks and their 
habitat). To fulfill that requirement, 
NMFS considers all measures that we 
are reasonably aware of (e.g., from recommendations or review of data) that 
have the potential to reduce impacts on 
marine mammal species or stocks, their 
habitat, or subsistence uses of those 
stocks. The extent to which the 
mitigation areas reduce impacts on the 
affected species is addressed in the 
Analysis and Negligible Impact 
Determination section of this rule. 
Comment 27 (ref 67): A commenter 
stated that the Navy does not 
incorporate stand-off distances of any 
size within its requirements for 
mitigation areas. Thus, activities that are 
otherwise restricted or limited within a 
mitigation area could occur directly 
along the boundary and ensonify the 
area at levels capable of causing injury 
or increasing the risk or severity of 
behavioral disruption. The commenter 
recommended that Navy consider 
establishing stand-off distances around 
its mitigation areas to the greatest extent 
practicable, allowing for variability in 
size given the location of the mitigation 
area, the type of operation at issue, and 
the species of concern. 
Response: The mitigation areas included in the final rule and described 
in chapter 5 (Mitigation) of the 2025 
HCTT EIS/OEIS represent the maximum 
mitigation within mitigation areas and 
the maximum size of mitigation areas 
that are practicable for the Action 
Proponents to implement under their 
specified activity. The Action 
Proponents have asserted, and NMFS 
concurs with the assessment, that 
implementing additional mitigation 
(e.g., stand-off distances that would extend the size of the mitigation areas) 
beyond what is included in the final 
rule is impracticable due to implications 
for safety, sustainability, and the Action 
Proponents’ ability to continue meeting 
their mission requirements. 
When practicable, NMFS sometimes 
recommends the inclusion of buffers 
around areas specifically delineated to 
contain certain important habitat or 
high densities of certain species, to 
allow for further reduced effects on 
specifically identified features/species. 
However, buffers are not typically 
considered necessary or appropriate in 
combination with more generalized and 
inclusive measures, such as coastal 
offsets or other areas that are intended 
to broadly contain important features for 
a multitude of species. In the case of 
this rulemaking, NMFS and the Action 
Proponents have included an extensive 
array of broad protective areas that will 
reduce impacts on numerous species 
and habitats (including additions to 
what was described in the proposed 
rule) and, as described above, 
limitations in additional areas is not 
practicable. 
Comment 28 (ref 34): A commenter 
stated that new scientific information 
could be incorporated into the design of 
mitigation areas, specifically referencing 
Houser et al. (2024) and Southall et al. (2024). The commenter stated that they 
can inform which types of acoustic 
sources to limit in mitigation areas 
important to particular species, and the 
size of the stand-off distances to apply 
to those areas. 
Response: The mitigation measures in this rule are informed by multiple 
factors, including the sensitivity of 
certain hearing groups to certain sound 
sources (informed by the Phase IV 
criteria and thresholds) and 
vulnerability to other threats (e.g., vessel strike). The Phase IV criteria and 
thresholds incorporate data from Houser 
et al. (2024), and as such, the mitigation 
areas in the proposed rule and final rule 
inherently consider those data. While

data from other studies, and the 
potential responses observed in Southall 
et al. (2024) occurred at received levels 
and distances assessed for potentially 
significant behavioral responses in the 
HCTT analysis. The commenter did not 
provide specific mitigation 
recommendations that may stem from 
the publications they reference. 
However, NMFS has responded to other 
mitigation recommendations from the 
commenter in separate responses herein 
and has explained that it has 
determined that the Action Proponents’ 
planned mitigation measures would 
effect the least practicable adverse 
impact on the affected species and their 
habitat. 
Comment 29 (ref 73): A commenter 
recommended that NMFS should 
consider requiring compensatory 
mitigation for the adverse impacts of the 
permitted activity on marine mammals 
and their habitat that cannot be 
prevented or mitigated. 
Response: Compensatory mitigation is not required under the MMPA. Instead, 
authorizations must include means of 
effecting the least practicable adverse 
impact from the activities on the 
affected species or stocks and their 
habitat, which this rule has done 
through the required procedural and 
geographic area mitigation measures. 
Also, the commenter did not 
recommend any specific measures, 
rendering it impossible to consider its 
recommendation at a broader level. 
Comment 30 (ref 69): A commenter 
recommended further research and 
exploration of the feasibility of signal 
modification, including converting up- 
sweeps to down-sweeps, reducing the 
level of the side bands, or lengthening 
the rise time. The 2024 HCTT Draft EIS/ 
OEIS considered, but rejected, 
modification of active sonar sources for 
training as part of a potential mitigation 
measure (‘‘26. Reducing annual active 
sonar hours, replacing active sonar, with 
passive sonar or modifying active sonar 
sources for training’’), deeming it 
impractical for achieving the mission. 
The commenter stated that the rationale 
provided in the 2024 HCTT Draft EIS/ 
OEIS does not clearly justify why signal 
modifications alone would be 
impractical. The commenter states that 
some of those modifications, such as 
converting up-sweeps to down-sweeps, 
would not alter the system’s spectral 
output in any way. The commenter 
stated that it believes source 
modification requires greater validation 
across species and in more behavioral 
contexts before any decisions are made 
to alter signals—but, given the 
preliminary data, and given the 
potential of this measure to reduce the 
instances and severity of behavioral 
harassment, it urges NMFS to elevate 
that research with the Navy. 
Response: Active sonar signals are designed explicitly to provide optimum 
performance at detecting underwater 
objects (e.g., submarines) in a variety of acoustic environments. The Action 
Proponents train with various active 
sonar signals, including up-sweeps and 
down-sweeps, to accurately replicate 
operational scenarios. Reducing training 
realism by restricting the signal used 
would ultimately prevent units from 
deploying with the required level of 
readiness necessary to accomplish their 
missions and impede the Action 
Proponents’ ability to certify forces to 
deploy to meet national security tasking. 
Likewise, testing program requirements 
include test parameters designed to 
accurately determine whether a system 
is meeting its operational and 
performance requirements. Reducing 
realism by restricting the signal used 
would impact the ability of researchers, 
program managers, and weapons system 
acquisition programs to effectively test 
systems and platforms (and components 
of these systems and platforms) before 
full-scale production or delivery to the 
fleet. For these reasons, the Navy has 
determined, and NMFS concurs, that 
modifying or limiting the sonar signal as 
mitigation is impractical to implement 
as it would result in degraded realism 
of training and testing. 
NMFS and the Navy will explore 
whether future studies on the efficacy 
and practicality of signal modification 
are appropriate in consideration of other 
ongoing research efforts, including some 
recommended by the commenter (e.g., 
thermal detection). However, at this 
time, given the numerous other research 
priorities and established impracticality, 
NMFS is not requiring the Action 
Proponents to investigate the efficacy of 
signal modification. 
Comment 31 (70): A commenter 
asserted that mitigation measures based 
on visual observation (i.e., by Lookouts), such as safety zone maintenance, results 
in highly limited risk reduction for most 
species and under most conditions. The 
commenter stated that NMFS should 
require infrared and thermal detection 
technologies as alternative detection 
measures for mitigation and monitoring, 
stating that these technologies have 
achieved a readiness level that is 
capable of supporting monitoring and 
mitigation during Phase IV military 
readiness activities. 
Response: Lookouts remain an important component of the Action 
Proponents’ mitigation strategy, 
especially as it relates to minimizing 
exposure to the more harmful impacts 
that may occur within closer proximity 
to the source, where Lookouts are most 
effective. As stated by the commenter, 
thermal detection technologies have 
advanced in recent years. However, 
significant limitations still exist, and the 
technology has not yet reached the level 
of performance needed for deployment 
during military readiness activities for 
mitigation uses. Current technologies 
are limited by: (1) low sensor resolution 
and a narrow field of view; (2) reduced 
performance in certain environmental 
conditions; and (3) high cost and 
uncertain long-term reliability. 
Thermal detection systems are more 
useful for detecting marine mammals in 
some marine environments than others. 
Current technologies have limitations 
regarding water temperature and survey 
conditions (e.g., rain, fog, sea state, glare, ambient brightness), for which 
further effectiveness studies are 
required. Thermal detection systems are 
generally thought to be most effective in 
cold environments, which have a large 
temperature differential between an 
animal’s temperature and the 
environment. Current thermal detection 
systems have proven more effective at 
detecting large whale blows than the 
bodies of small animals, particularly at 
a distance. The effectiveness of current 
technologies has not been demonstrated 
for small marine mammals at-sea 
(noting that Richter et al. (2023) 
demonstrated efficacy in detecting killer 
whales in the Salish Sea using land- 
based thermal imaging systems). 
Thermal detection systems exhibit 
varying degrees of false positive 
detections (i.e., incorrect notifications) due in part to their low sensor 
resolution and reduced performance in 
certain environmental conditions. False 
positive detections may incorrectly 
identify other features (e.g., birds, waves, boats) as marine mammals 
(Boebel and Zitterbart, 2017; Zitterbart 
et al., 2020). 
Thermal detection systems for 
military applications are deployed on 
various Department of Defense (DoD) 
platforms. These systems were initially 
developed for nighttime targeting and 
object detection such as a boat, vehicle, 
or people and are not optimized for 
marine mammal detections versus 
object detection, nor do these systems 
have the automated marine mammal 
detection algorithms the Navy is testing 
via its ongoing research program. The 
Action Proponents do not have available 
personnel to add Lookouts to use 
thermal detection systems in tandem

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258828 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations with existing Lookouts who are using 
traditional observation techniques. 
Existing specialized DoD infrared/ 
thermal capabilities on Navy aircraft 
and surface ships are designed for fine- 
scale targeting. Viewing arcs of these 
thermal systems are narrow and focused 
on a target area. Furthermore, sensors 
are typically used only in select training 
events and have a limited lifespan 
before requiring expensive replacement. 
Some sensor elements can cost upward 
of $300,000 to $500,000 per device, so 
their use is predicated on a distinct 
military need. 
The Office of Naval Research 
sponsored a project from 2019 to 2023 
titled ‘‘Development of the Next 
Generation Automatic Surface Whale 
Detection System for Marine Mammal 
Mitigation and Distribution Estimation.’’ 
The aim of the project was to develop 
a system to be used by non-experts, with 
minimal installation requirements, 
applying algorithms to reliably detect, 
localize, and identify surfaced marine 
mammals from a vessel, while 
minimizing false detections. In 2024, 
the project transitioned to the Navy’s 
Living Marine Resources Program, the 
applied research, development, test, and 
evaluation (RDT&E) program that funds 
Navy driven research needs to support 
at-sea compliance and permitting. 
Thermal Imaging for Vessel Strike 
Mitigation on Autonomous Vessels 
(Project #LMR–68) will focus on 
adapting and testing two existing and 
proven thermal imaging-based whale 
detection systems to reduce the 
potential for vessel strike during 
navigation of unmanned Navy surface 
vessels. 
When infrared and thermal mitigation 
technologies mature to the state where 
they are determined to be sufficiently 
effective at mitigating marine mammal 
impacts when considering the range of 
environmental conditions analogous to 
where the Action Proponents train and 
test and the species that could co-occur 
in space and time with the activities, 
then the Action Proponents will assess 
their compatibility with military 
readiness applications on both manned 
and unmanned vessels. This would 
include a practicality assessment of the 
budget and acquisition process 
(including costs associated with 
designing, building, installing, 
maintaining, and manning equipment), 
the logistical and physical 
considerations for retrofitting platforms 
with the appropriate equipment and 
their associated maintenance, repairs, or 
replacements (e.g., conducting engineering studies to ensure 
compatibility with existing shipboard 
systems), the resource considerations for 
training personnel to effectively operate 
the equipment, and the potential 
security and classification issues. New 
system integration on Action 
Proponents’ assets can entail up to 5–10 
years of effort to account for acquisition, 
engineering studies, and development 
and execution of systems training. 
Given the assessment above, this final 
rule does not require the Action 
Proponents to utilize thermal detection 
for mitigating training and testing 
impacts on marine mammals. As 
thermal detection technology improves 
and practicability of applying the 
technology for training and testing 
activities is further assessed, NMFS will 
consider whether requirements to 
utilize thermal detection for mitigating 
impacts to marine mammals is 
appropriate. 
Comment 32 (ref 24, 72): The 
Commission recommended that NMFS 
require the Navy to use its instrumented 
ranges and sonobuoys to localize marine 
mammals and implement the relevant 
mitigation measures during active 
acoustic events and to take a harder look 
at the technologies that the Canadian 
Department of National Defense (DND) 
uses during its at-sea activities and 
incorporate those technologies 
accordingly for other Phase IV LOA 
applications. The Commission cites the 
Lookout Effectiveness Study 
(Oedekoven and Thomas, 2022) in 
support of its recommendation. 
In a related comment, a commenter 
stated that the Navy has substantial 
capability, at both SOAR and PMRF, to 
detect, identify, localize, and track 
various cetacean species in real time, 
citing that the capability has been used 
to support behavioral response studies 
in both locations (e.g., Helble et al., 2015; Kates Varghese et al., 2020; 
Jacobson et al., 2022). Yet, the Navy claims that using passive acoustic range 
instrumentation for mitigation purposes 
is still in a research and development 
stage ‘‘not sufficiently beneficial’’ (2024 
HCTT Draft EIS/OEIS at 5–33, table 5– 
20). However, scientific studies have 
used that instrumentation for exactly 
these types of purposes, and the 
methodologies undertaken—while 
continually evolving—do not require 
more research and development before 
they can be used to support the 
mitigation of acoustic, explosive, and 
vessel-related stressors. The commenter 
states that NMFS should require use of 
what is plainly a viable form of 
mitigation. 
Response: The Action Proponents intend to continue to use passive 
acoustic monitoring (PAM) prior to 
activities involving explosive sonobuoys 
and explosive torpedoes, and during 
sinking exercises (SINKEX). During the 
use of active acoustics, Navy assets with 
PAM capabilities (e.g., sonobuoys) that are already participating in an activity 
will continue to monitor for marine 
mammals, as described in section 5.6 
(Activity-based Mitigations) of the 2025 
HCTT EIS/OEIS. However, the fluidity 
and nature of military readiness 
activities (e.g., fast-paced and mobile readiness evolutions), as well as the 
limitations of these monitoring 
capabilities, make it impractical for 
passive acoustic devices to be used as 
precise real-time indicators of marine 
mammal location for mitigation (e.g., 
active sonar power downs or 
shutdowns, ceasing use of explosives) 
without an accompanying visual 
sighting. While we acknowledge that the 
Lookout Effectiveness Study suggests 
that detection of marine mammals is 
less certain than previously assumed at 
certain distances, we disagree with the 
assertion that the use of Lookouts has 
been shown to be wholly ineffective. 
Lookouts remain an important 
component of the Action Proponents’ 
mitigation strategy, especially as it 
relates to minimizing exposure to the 
more harmful impacts that may occur 
within closer proximity to the source, 
where Lookouts are most effective. 
The Navy asserts that its instrumented 
ranges do not have the capabilities to be 
used effectively for mitigation. The 
range hydrophones cannot track animals 
with any granularity and can only detect 
whether animals are present in a general 
area. Most notably, there is not a real- 
time feed of hydrophone data to vessel 
and aircraft operators. Further, animals 
are almost always present on the ranges, 
therefore expending the resources to 
notify exercise participants is not 
necessary. Given these practicability 
issues and expected ineffectiveness, 
NMFS concludes that these suggested 
measures are not practicable and is not 
requiring the Action Proponents to 
utilize its passive acoustic range 
instrumentation for mitigating impacts 
to marine mammals. Please see section 
5.5.3 (Active and Passive Acoustic 
Monitoring Devices) of the 2018 HSTT 
EIS/OEIS. 
The Action Proponents and NMFS 
have considered and will continue to 
study the Canadian DND project, 
including the technologies used during 
at-sea activities; however, NMFS 
disagrees that such a requirement is 
warranted in this final rule. As more 
information from the Canadian DND 
project becomes available, the Action 
Proponents and NMFS may reconsider 
whether additional requirements are 
needed.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258829 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations Comment 33 (ref 25): The 
Commission strongly recommended that 
NMFS require the Navy to use PAM 
prior to and during activities involving 
ship shock trials in the final rule, 
consistent with explosive sonobuoys, 
explosive torpedoes, and sinking 
exercises. The Commission notes that 
since mission effectiveness would not 
be impacted, the measures are 
considered practicable, and their 
implementation would reduce the 
potential for the most lethal marine 
mammal impacts. 
Response: Consistent with the proposed rule, this final rule requires 
the Navy to use PAM prior to and 
during activities involving explosive 
sonobuoys and explosive torpedoes, and 
during sinking exercises when passive 
acoustic devices are already being used 
during weapon firing. For ship shock 
trials, while use of sonobuoys would not 
affect the ship shock trial, PAM from a 
2001 ship shock trial for the Churchill 
full ship shock trial was considered 
ineffective (Clarke and Norman, 2005). 
As such, and given the significant 
expense associated with implementing 
PAM for ship shock trials, NMFS is not 
requiring the Navy to conduct PAM 
prior to and during ship shock trials. 
Comment 34 (ref 26): The 
Commission strongly recommended that 
NMFS require the Navy to use passive 
acoustic devices (i.e., directional frequency analysis and recording 
(DIFAR) and other types of passive 
sonobuoys, operational hydrophones) 
prior to explosive bombing exercises 
and air-to-surface and surface-to-surface 
explosive missile and rocket exercises to 
detect marine mammals and implement 
the necessary mitigation measures in the 
final rule. 
Response: The Navy employs PAM to supplement visual monitoring when 
practicable to do so (i.e., when assets that have PAM capabilities are already 
participating in the activity). For 
explosive events in which there are no 
platforms participating that have PAM 
capabilities, adding PAM capability for 
mitigation, either by adding a PAM 
device (e.g., hydrophone) to a platform already participating in the activity or 
by adding a platform with integrated 
PAM capabilities to the activity (e.g., a sonobuoy), is not practicable. 
The type of aircraft that conduct these 
bombing, missile, and rocket exercises 
do not have the capability to deploy and 
employ sonobuoys. The Action 
Proponents state that diverting 
platforms that have PAM capabilities 
would impact their ability to meet their 
Title 10 requirements and reduce the 
service life of those systems. The Action 
Proponents additionally state that there 
are significant manpower and logistical 
constraints that make constructing and 
maintaining additional PAM systems or 
platforms for additional training and 
testing activities impracticable. Given 
the impracticality of such a measure, 
NMFS has found that this measure is 
not warranted, and it is not required in 
this final rule. 
Comment 35 (ref 31, 32–2): A 
commenter recommended that NMFS 
prohibit high-intensity acoustic and 
explosive activities in BIAs during 
breeding, calving, or nursing seasons. 
Another commenter stated that training 
places should also be limited and not 
take place in marine protected areas or 
sensitive habitats. 
Response: This final rule includes extensive mitigation measures in BIAs, 
including reproductive BIAs that are 
important for breeding, calving, and/or 
nursing. In Hawaii, mitigation in the 
Hawaii Island Marine Mammal 
Mitigation Area and Hawaii 4-Islands 
Marine Mammal Mitigation Area 
(including an expansion of this 
mitigation area since publication of the 
proposed rule as described in the 
Changes from the Proposed Rule to the 
Final Rule section), as well as the 
Hawaii Humpback Whale Awareness 
Messages, are designed to protect 
marine mammals in sensitive habitats, 
including reproductive habitat for 
humpback whales, and to protect small 
and resident marine mammal 
populations. In California, the Northern 
California Large Whale Mitigation Area, 
Central California Large Whale 
Mitigation Area, Southern California 
Blue Whale Mitigation Area, California 
Large Whale Awareness Messages, 
California Large Whale Real-time 
Notification Mitigation Area, and San 
Nicolas Island Pinniped Haulout 
Mitigation Area are designed to protect 
marine mammals in sensitive habitats, 
including foraging, migratory, and 
calving habitats for large whales, and 
from more severe impacts (e.g., auditory injury, vessel strike). Please see the 
Geographic Mitigation Areas section of 
this final rule for additional detail about 
the restrictions within these mitigation 
areas and the benefits they provide to 
marine mammals. 
The Action Proponents have asserted, 
and NMFS concurs with the assessment, 
that implementing additional mitigation 
(e.g., expanded mitigation areas) beyond what is included in the final rule is 
impracticable due to implications for 
safety, sustainability, and the Action 
Proponents’ ability to continue meeting 
their mission requirements. 
Comment 36 (ref 22a): The 
Commission recommended that NMFS 
include the San Nicolas Island 
Mitigation Area in the final rule, limit 
the number of sonar hours combined to 
no more than 300 hours of mid- 
frequency (MF)1 hull-mounted surface 
ship sonar combined for this mitigation 
area and the Southern California Blue 
Whale, the Central California Large 
Whale, and Northern California Large 
Whale Mitigation Areas from June 1 
through November 30, and prohibit 
explosives (i.e., mine warfare, large- caliber gunnery rounds, torpedoes, 
bombs, and missiles) from June 1 
through November 30. The Commission 
states that the current core feeding BIA 
for blue whales (figure K–19 in the 2024 
HCTT Draft EIS/OEIS and figure 2 in 
Calambokidis et al. (2024)) overlaps the San Nicolas Island Mitigation Area that 
was part of the litigation settlement 
agreement in 2015 for Conservation 
Council for Hawaii v. National Marine Fisheries Service, as well as the Phase 
III HSTT EIS/OEIS and associated 
rulemaking. 
Response: The Action Proponents assert that, due to the inclusion of Point 
Mugu Sea Range activities in the 
specified activities, it is impractical to 
continue mitigation in the former San 
Nicolas Island Mitigation Area and to 
extend the temporal restrictions beyond 
the 5 months already proposed. Doing 
so would modify military readiness 
activities in a way that would prevent 
them from meeting mission objectives 
and hinder Navy ability to realistically 
train and test in furtherance of its 
statutory mandate. See table 5–1 of the 
HCTT EIS/OEIS for examples. NMFS 
agrees that the suggested measures are 
not practicable in light of the military 
readiness impacts, as explained further 
below. 
Of note, the portion of the blue whale 
core feeding BIA that overlaps the 
recommended San Nicolas Island 
Mitigation Area would be extremely 
small in comparison to the full BIA. 
Over 38 percent (38.41) of the core blue 
whale feeding BIA overlaps the 
Northern California Large Whale and 
Central California Large Whale 
Mitigation Areas, and the mitigation in 
these areas will reduce impacts that 
could result in lost feeding 
opportunities. Over 42 percent (42.35 
percent) of the BIA is outside of the 
HCTT Study Area.

Blue Whale, Central California Large 
Whale, and Northern California Large

scientific evidence from sightings data 
and passive acoustic detections show 
that blue whales are present off 
southern California almost year-round 
and at relatively higher densities from 
April 1 through December 31. The 
commenter also recommended that 
NMFS limit all sources of MFAS and 
require seasonal and/or dynamic vessel 
speed restrictions within the mitigation 
area. 
In a related comment, the 
Commission recommended that NMFS 
extend the timing restrictions from 
October 31 to November 30 for the 
Southern California Blue Whale, Central 
California Large Whale, and Northern 
California Large Whale Mitigation Areas 
in the final rule. 
Response: Regarding the recommendation to extend the 
seasonality of the Southern California 
Blue Whale Mitigation Area to April 1 
to December 31 or November 30 as 
recommended by the commenter and 
the Commission, respectively, the 
Action Proponents assert that extending 
the temporal restrictions beyond the 
period of June 1 through October 31 
included in the proposed rule would be 
impractical because it would modify 
military readiness activities in a way 
that would prevent them from meeting 
mission objectives and hinder Navy 
ability to realistically train and test in 
furtherance of its statutory mandate. See 
table 5–1 of the HCTT EIS/OEIS for 
examples. Further, the revised blue 
whale core feeding area identified by 
Calambokidis et al. (2024) is effective from June through November, and the 
Southern California Blue Whale 
Mitigation Area is already effective from 
June 1 through October 31 (i.e., all but 1 month that the BIA is in effect). Given 
the practicality issues, NMFS is not 
requiring the Action Proponents to 
extend the effective period of this 
mitigation area. Please see NMFS’ 
response to Comment 38 for a response 
to the Commission’s recommendation 
pertaining to the Central California 
Large Whale and Northern California 
Large Whale Mitigation Areas. 
Regarding the recommendation to 
limit all sources of MFAS within the 
mitigation area, the Action Proponents 
assert that increasing the active sonar 
restrictions beyond what is already 
proposed would be impractical because 
it would modify military readiness 
activities in a way that would prevent 
them from meeting mission objectives 
and hinder Navy ability to realistically 
train and test in furtherance of its 
statutory mandate. See table 5–1 of the 
HCTT EIS/OEIS for examples. Other 
training and testing MFAS systems are 
likely to be used less frequently in the 
vicinity of the Southern California Blue 
Whale Mitigation Area than surface ship 
hull-mounted MFAS for which the 
mitigation area contains restrictions. 
Given water depths, the Southern 
California Blue Whale Mitigation Area 
is not conducive for large scale anti- 
submarine warfare exercises, nor is it 
near areas where other anti-submarine 
warfare training and testing occurs. 
However, due to the presence of existing 
Navy subareas in the vicinity of the 
southern part of the Southern California 
Blue Whale Mitigation Area, a limited 
amount of helicopter dipping MFAS 
could occur. These designated range 
areas are required for proximity to 
airfields in San Diego such as Naval Air 
Station North Island and for airspace 
management. However, helicopters only 
used these areas for a Kilo Dip. A Kilo 
Dip is a functional check of 
approximately one to two pings of 
active sonar to confirm the system is 
operational before the helicopter heads 
to more remote offshore training areas. 
This ensures proper system operation 
and avoids loss of limited training time, 
expenditure of fuel, and cumulative 
engine use in the event of equipment 
malfunction. The potential effects of 
dipping sonar have been accounted for 
in the Navy’s analysis. Further, due to 
lower power settings for dipping sonar, 
potential impact ranges of dipping sonar 
are significantly lower than surface ship 
sonars, and during a Kilo Dip or any 
other use of MFAS, the Action 
Proponents will implement the activity- 
based mitigation measures. 
Regarding the recommendation to 
require seasonal and/or dynamic vessel 
speed restrictions within the mitigation 
area, the Action Proponents assert that 
such restrictions are not practicable 
based on safety, sustainability, and 
mission criteria. NMFS has reviewed 
the analysis of these additional 
suggested restrictions and the impacts 
they would have on military readiness 
and concurs with the Navy’s assessment 
that they are impracticable (see row 16 
of table 5–20 in chapter 5 of the 2025 
HCTT EIS/OEIS). Of note, in a review of 
Navy unpublished data, the multi-year 
average of U.S. Navy surface ship 
speeds on the continental shelf off 
California is between 10–15 knots (kn) 
(18.5–27.8 km/hr). In addition to the 
practicality concerns, none of the 
known vessel strikes by the Action 
Proponents in the HCTT Study Area 
have occurred in the Southern 
California Blue Whale Mitigation Area, 
suggesting that risk of vessel strike by 
the Action Proponents in this area is 
relatively low in comparison to other 
parts of the Study Area. As such, given 
the practicality concerns and the limited 
risk of vessel strike within the 
mitigation area, this final rule does not 
require speed restrictions in the 
Southern California Blue Whale 
Mitigation Area. However, activity- 
based mitigation for manned surface 
vessels requires maneuvering vessels to 
maintain a specified distance from 
marine mammals, which may include 
reducing speed. 
Comment 38 (refs 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 
44, 45): A commenter recommended 
that NMFS extend the seasonality of the 
Central California Large Whale 
Mitigation Area to April 1st to 
December 31st to reflect that 
aggregations of humpback whales occur 
off central California through December 
and that blue whales arrive in the region 
as early as April. The commenter further 
recommended that NMFS prohibit use 
of dipping sonar, restrict other sources 
of MFAS, prohibit use of low-frequency 
active sonar (LFAS), prohibit the use of 
in-water explosives, and require vessel 
speed restrictions. In a related comment, 
a commenter recommended that NMFS 
enhance the mitigation measures in the 
Northern California Large Whale 
Mitigation Area to align with those 
proposed for the Central California 
Large Whale Mitigation Area. 
Response: Regarding the commenter’s recommendation to extend the 
seasonality of the Central California 
Large Whale and Northern California 
Large Whale Mitigation Areas to April 
1st to December 31 or November 30 as 
recommended by the commenter and 
the Commission, respectively, the 
Action Proponents assert that extending 
the temporal restrictions beyond the five 
months already proposed would be 
impractical because it would modify 
military readiness activities in a way 
that would prevent them from meeting 
mission objectives and hinder the 
Action Proponents’ abilities to 
realistically train and test in furtherance 
of their statutory mandates. See table 5– 
1 of the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS for 
examples. 
Regarding active sonar sources, the 
Action Proponents anticipate that use of 
dipping sonar in the Central California 
Large Whale and Northern California 
Large Whale Mitigation Areas will be 
infrequent relative to other portions of 
the California Study Area, given the 
distance of the mitigation areas from 
airfields with helicopters that would use 
dipping sonar. Further, other than hull- 
mounted MFAS, for which this 
mitigation areas already include a 
restriction, and dipping sonar, the 
Action Proponents anticipate that use of

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258831 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations MFAS in the Central California Large 
Whale and Northern California Large 
Whale Mitigation Areas will be 
infrequent relative to other portions of 
the California Study Area. Similarly, the 
Action Proponents anticipate that use of 
LFAS and explosives in the Central 
California Large Whale and Northern 
California Large Whale Mitigation Areas 
will be infrequent relative to other 
portions of the California Study Area. 
As such, restrictions on the already low 
use of these sources within the 
mitigation areas would not provide 
sufficient benefits to marine mammals, 
and are not required by this final rule. 
However, this rule includes activity- 
based mitigation for all active sonar and 
explosive activities. 
Regarding the recommendation to 
require vessel speed restrictions within 
the mitigation areas, the Navy asserts 
that such restrictions are not practicable 
based on safety, sustainability, and 
mission criteria. NMFS has reviewed 
the analysis of these additional 
suggested restrictions and the impacts 
they would have on military readiness 
and concurs with the Navy’s assessment 
that they are impracticable (see row 16 
of table 5–20 in chapter 5 of the 2025 
HCTT EIS/OEIS). Of note, in a review of 
Navy unpublished data, the multi-year 
average of U.S. Navy surface ship 
speeds on the continental shelf off 
California is between 10–15 kn (18.5– 
27.8 km/hr). Given the practicality 
concerns, this final rule does not require 
speed restrictions in the Central 
California Large Whale and Northern 
California Large Whale Mitigation 
Areas. However, activity-based 
mitigation for manned surface vessels 
requires maneuvering vessels to 
maintain a specified distance from 
marine mammals, which may include 
reducing speed. 
Comment 39 (ref 47, 48): A 
commenter recommended that within 
the California Large Whale Awareness 
Message Mitigation Area, NMFS should 
require the Navy to issue awareness 
notifications for gray whales and fin 
whales during the timeframes when 
they are most likely to occur in the 
greatest densities, November through 
June, and June through November 
respectively. The commenter also 
recommended that NMFS require the 
Navy to use the dynamic species 
distribution models (SDMs) developed 
by the SWFSC and the WhaleWatch 
model predictions to inform their assets 
on where and when concentrations of 
whales are most likely to be present 
based on recent oceanographic 
conditions. 
Response: The Action Proponents must broadcast awareness messages to 
alert applicable assets (and their 
Lookouts) transiting and training or 
testing off the U.S. West Coast to the 
possible presence of concentrations of 
large whales, including gray whales, fin 
whales, and mixed concentrations of 
blue, humpback, and fin whales that 
may occur based on predicted 
oceanographic conditions for a given 
year (e.g., May–November, April– November) and are intended to be 
temporally dynamic. The Navy 
currently releases two West Coast whale 
awareness messages per year, a fall 
message for gray and fin whales and a 
spring message for mixed 
concentrations of blue, humpback, and 
fin whales that may occur based on 
predicted oceanographic conditions for 
a given year. In this final rule and in 
response to comments relating to gray 
whales, the effective end date of the fall 
message has been extended from May, 
as included in the proposed rule, to 
June 30. The effective start date of the 
spring message is based upon 
oceanographic conditions and continues 
through November when the effective 
period of the BIAs identified by 
Calambokidis et al. (2024) ends). While the commenter suggests that the 
awareness messages align directly to the 
BIAs, for the blue and fin whale 
message, NMFS and the Action 
Proponents agree that it is more 
appropriate to base this message upon 
oceanographic conditions, as fin whale 
or blue whale presence in the spring 
may vary from year-to-year. 
Dynamic SDMs and WhaleSafe 
information inform the details included 
in the Navy’s annual awareness 
messages. These models are not suitable 
to the small scale range sub-areas Navy 
vessels must operate in due to training 
and testing requirements, schedule 
deconfliction, and safety. Nor are the 
models suitable or available to vessels at 
sea due to satellite transmission 
bandwidth restrictions (i.e., limited internet access). 
Comment 40 (ref 49, 50, 51): A 
commenter recommended that within 
the California Large Whale Real-Time 
Notification Mitigation Area, NMFS 
require issuance of real-time 
notifications when one or more large 
whales are observed within 1 nmi (1.8 
km) of a Navy vessel, and extend 
notifications to U.S. Coast Guard vessels 
performing or supporting Navy-related 
activities. The commenter also 
recommended that within the 
Mitigation Area, the Navy should be 
required to deploy unmanned acoustic 
gliders or fixed hydrophones with real- 
time acoustic detection capability, and 
to use both acoustic and visual 
detections to trigger real-time 
notifications. Last, the commenter stated 
that upon receipt of a real-time 
notification, Navy vessels and Coast 
Guard vessels engaged in training and 
testing activities should reduce or 
maintain vessel speeds at 10 kn (18.5 
km/hr) until whales are no longer 
detected in the area either visually or 
acoustically. 
Response: This final rule includes a modification to the California Large 
Whale Real-Time Notification 
Mitigation Area. Rather than 
notifications being issued following 
observation of four or more large whales 
within 1 nmi (1.8 km), this final rule 
requires notifications to be issued 
following observation of three large 
whales within 1 nmi (1.8 km) of a Navy 
vessel. Individual large whale sightings 
within California are particularly 
common. The Navy reviewed sighting 
data from NMFS’ SWFSC and Navy- 
funded researchers and determined that 
a group of four large whales might be 
indicative of unusual foraging or other 
life history events. However, following 
the additional strikes that have occurred 
since the 2025 HCTT proposed rule (90 
FR 32118, July 16, 2025), the Action 
Proponents are reducing this to three 
large whales. Strike risk from U.S. Coast 
Guard vessels is different from Navy 
vessels. Historic Coast Guard strikes 
were from smaller vessels mostly 
outside of the HCTT Study Area with 
none associated with combined Navy 
training. However, if Navy vessels are 
training in coordination with U.S. Coast 
Guard vessels, bridge-to-bridge radio 
will be used to disseminate these 
notifications. Of note, real-time PAM 
would not detect whales that are not 
vocalizing, and passive acoustic 
monitoring would only be indicative 
that whales are present but not of their 
location relative to Navy or Coast Guard 
vessels. 
Please see NMFS’ response to 
Comment 32 regarding the 
recommendation to use both visual and 
passive acoustic monitoring platforms to 
detect whales and trigger awareness 
notification systems. 
The dynamic vessel speed restrictions 
upon receipt of a real-time notification 
within the mitigation area are not 
practicable for the reasons discussed in 
response to Comment 50. 
Comment 41 (ref 52): A commenter 
stated that NMFS should carefully 
consider prohibiting major training 
exercises (MTE) or exercise components 
involving hull-mounted MFAS within 
the Hawai1i Island Marine Mammal 
Mitigation Area. The commenter states 
that if some major exercises absolutely 
cannot be avoided, the Navy should 
consider further reducing their number,

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258832 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations and, to the extent practicable, carry out 
each exercise in a different portion of 
the Hawai1i Island Marine Mammal 
Mitigation Area (i.e., one exercise in the north, one exercise in the south), to 
ensure that marine mammal populations 
with highly discrete site fidelity, as 
indicated by the designation of child 
small and resident BIAs, are not 
exposed to multiple MTEs within a 
single year. 
Response: An MTE, for purposes of this rulemaking, consists of several unit- 
level activities conducted by several 
units operating together, commanded 
and controlled by a single Commander, 
and typically generating more than 100 
hours of active sonar. The multiple 
units involved in an MTE would often 
be spread across the Hawaii Range 
Complex (HRC), and as such, there is 
rarely a concentration of sonar or other 
stressors in one area. Further, the 
individual activities that make up an 
MTE would not frequently occur within 
the Hawaii Island Marine Mammal 
Mitigation Area. The main Hawaii-based 
MTE, Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC), 
occurs only every other year in the 
summer and outside of humpback 
whale breeding season. While all areas 
of HRC could be used for some sort of 
training during RIMPAC, the majority of 
sonar and explosive use generally, but 
not exclusively, occurs outside of the 
mitigation area. Mitigation within the 
Hawaii Island Marine Mammal 
Mitigation Area requires that the Action 
Proponents must not use more than 300 
combined hours of MF1 and MF1C 
surface ship hull-mounted MFAS or 20 
hours of helicopter dipping sonar (an 
MFAS source) annually within the 
mitigation area. This includes any 
combination of MTEs or unit level 
training. Additionally, explosive use in 
the Hawaii Island Marine Mammal 
Mitigation area is prohibited year- 
round. 
Comment 42 (ref 23, 35, 53, 54, 55, 56, 
57, 58): A commenter recommended 
that NMFS extend the boundaries of the 
Hawaii 4-Islands Marine Mammal 
Mitigation Area to encompass the child 
small and resident BIAs for the 
endangered Main Hawaiian Islands 
Insular Distinct Population Segment 
(DPS) of false killer whales, including 
the northeast Kaiwi Channel. The 
commenter also recommended that 
NMFS extend the prohibition on the use 
of MF1 surface ship hull-mounted 
MFAS and LFAS in this area from 
December 1 through May 31 to align 
with the effective period of the BIA for 
humpback whales identified by Kratofil 
et al. (2023). Further, the commenter 
recommended that year-round, NMFS 
prohibit the use of dipping sonar and 
limit all other sources of MFAS. Last, 
the commenter recommended that 
NMFS require vessel speed restrictions 
between December 1 and May 31. In a 
related comment, the Commission 
recommended that NMFS include the 
core small and resident BIA areas off 
Oahu, Lanai, and Molokai in the Hawaii 
4-Islands Mitigation Area, which 
prohibits use of MF1 hull-mounted 
surface ship sonar from November 15 to 
April 15 and in-water explosives year- 
round. 
In a related comment, a commenter 
stated that the HRC and Temporary 
Operating Area overlap with essential 
calving and breeding habitats. The 
commenter stated that to comply with 
MMPA intent, operations with high 
acoustic or explosive output should be 
prohibited during known sensitive 
periods for reproduction and nursing. 
In a related comment, a commenter 
stated that the available scientific 
evidence on the impacts of dipping 
sonar on deep-dive rates in beaked 
whales (family Ziphiidae), indicates that 
management of this acoustic source 
should be expanded, including to areas 
representing important habitat for 
beaked whale species. 
Response: The Hawaii 4-Islands Marine Mammal Mitigation Area 
contains portions of nine updated BIAs 
(Kratofil et al., 2023), including part of the false killer whale core small and 
resident BIA. This final rule includes an 
expansion of the Hawaii 4-Islands 
Mitigation Area, as recommended by the 
Commission and the commenter. The 
expanded area includes an additional 
portion (1,969 km
2
) of the child small 
and resident BIA for the Main Hawaiian 
Islands Insular stock of false killer 
whale, while avoiding restrictions in the 
Kaiwi Channel between Oahu and 
Molokai, the Aloha Submarine Transit 
Lane, and Penguin Bank which are 
important for Navy’s training and 
testing activities. This increases the 
portion of the child BIA overlapping the 
mitigation area from approximately 40 
percent of the BIA as included in the 
proposed rule to 63 percent. 
Additionally, this final rule clarifies that 
the MFAS mitigation in this area and in 
the Hawaii Island Marine Mammal 
Mitigation Area includes both MF1 and 
MF1C surface ship hull-mounted 
MFAS. MF1C was inadvertently left out 
of the Action Proponents application 
and subsequently the proposed rule. 
The Action Proponents assert that 
further expanding the Mitigation Area 
would result in degraded training and 
testing realism. As stated in section 
K.3.3.3 of the HCTT EIS/OEIS, as it 
relates to anti-submarine warfare, the 
training value within the 4-Islands 
Region is much higher compared to 
other near shore environments within 
the HRC due to the challenging 
bathymetry. As such, NMFS is not 
requiring the Action Proponents to 
expand the spatial extent of the 
mitigation area to the full extent 
recommended by the commenter. 
The Action Proponents assert that 
extending the restrictions on active 
sonar or explosives, including limits or 
prohibition of MFAS and LFAS sources, 
in the Hawaii 4-Islands Marine Mammal 
Mitigation Area beyond that required by 
the proposed rule would be impractical 
because it would modify military 
readiness activities in a way that would 
prevent them from meeting mission 
objectives and inhibit their abilities to 
meet statutory mandates. Further 
restrictions on dipping sonar use would 
be impractical for the same reasons. 
However, the current geographic extent 
of the Hawaii Island Marine Mammal 
Mitigation Area wholly encompasses 
the most important portion (i.e., ‘‘child’’ portion of a hierarchical BIA) of the 
Blainville’s beaked whale BIA, the vast 
majority of the most important portion 
of the goose-beaked whale BIA, and 
portions of both species’ parent BIAs. 
Within this mitigation area, the Action 
Proponents must not use more than 20 
hours of MF helicopter dipping sonar 
annually. 
Regarding the recommendation to 
require vessel speed restrictions within 
the mitigation area from December 1 
through May 31, the Navy asserts that 
such restrictions are not practicable 
based on safety, sustainability, and 
mission criteria. NMFS has reviewed 
the analysis of these additional 
suggested restrictions and the impacts 
they would have on military readiness 
and concurs with the Navy’s assessment 
that they are impracticable (see row 16 
of table 5–20 in chapter 5 of the 2025 
HCTT EIS/OEIS). Of note, in a review of 
Navy unpublished data, the multi-year 
average of U.S. Navy surface ship 
speeds on the continental shelf off 
California is between 10–15 kn (18.5– 
27.8 km/hr). Given the practicality 
concerns, this final rule does not require 
speed restrictions in the Southern 
California Blue Whale Mitigation Area. 
However, activity-based mitigation for 
manned surface vessels requires 
maneuvering vessels to maintain a 
specified distance from marine 
mammals, which may include reducing 
speed.

Banks. The commenter recommended 
that the Navy and NMFS convene a 
group of experts to develop a suite of 
mitigation measures ‘‘that are feasible 
for the Navy but would still reduce 
harm to individual beaked whales and 
the risk of population-level impacts’’ in 
the SOCAL Range Complex. The 
commenter recommended that, until 
that time, NMFS should require 
maintenance of the San Nicolas and 
Santa Barbara Mitigation Areas. The 
commenter also stated that without 
meaningful additional mitigation, it 
does not see how population-level harm 
would not occur or, ultimately, how a 
‘‘negligible impact’’ finding under the 
MMPA could be reached with respect to 
the goose-beaked whale population 
associated with San Clemente Island. 
The commenter also recommended 
considering source-based approaches 
such as signal modification to mitigate 
impacts on goose-beaked whales and 
other frequently exposed populations. 
Response: NMFS and the Navy have fully considered potential mitigation for 
all species of marine mammals 
throughout the HCTT Study Area, 
including beaked whales, and NMFS 
has determined that the mitigation 
included in this final rule will effect the 
least practicable adverse impact on the 
affected species and stocks and their 
habitat, as required by the MMPA. 
Within San Nicolas Basin, there is a 
documented, recurring number of goose- 
beaked whales (Falcone et al., 2009; 
Barlow et al., 2021a, 2021b; Curtis et al., 2021) strongly indicating that the Navy’s 
activities are not having a population- 
level impact to what may be a resident 
population of this species. This is 
supported by repeated visual re-sighting 
rates of individuals, sightings of calves 
and, more importantly, reproductive 
females, and passive acoustic 
assessments of steady vocalization rates 
and abundance over at least the most 
recent 7-year interval (Curtis et al., 
2021; Schorr et al., 2024). 
As described in response to Comment 
36, the Action Proponents assert that, due to the inclusion of Point Mugu Sea 
Range activities in the specified 
activities, it is impractical to continue 
mitigation in the former San Nicolas 
Island Mitigation Area. Doing so would 
modify military readiness activities in a 
way that would prevent them from 
meeting mission objectives and hinder 
Navy ability to realistically train and 
test in furtherance of its statutory 
mandate. See table 5–1 of the HCTT 
EIS/OEIS for examples. NMFS agrees 
with this assessment and is not 
requiring the Navy to continue the 
former San Nicolas Island Mitigation 
Area, consistent with the proposed rule. 
The Santa Barbara Island Mitigation 
Area was previously created to 
minimize impacts to blue whales and 
gray whales in identified BIAs 
(Calambokidis et al., 2015), which have since been updated (Calambokidis et al., 
2024). Just a portion of the former Santa 
Barbara Island Mitigation Area area 
meets the scientifically accepted 
minimum depth criteria expected for 
beaked whale habitat, in Southern 
California, usually greater than 800 m. 
The bathymetric area greater than 800 m 
depth and within the Santa Barbara 
Island Mitigation Area is approximately 
24 square nmi (nmi
2
) (26 percent of the 
total Mitigation Area spatial extent or 
only 0.02 percent of the total HSTT 
SOCAL area, which would represent an 
even smaller percentage of the 
California Study Area considered in this 
final rule). Beaked whale monitoring at 
other locations within SOCAL have 
shown that even in ocean basins 
thought to have a goose-beaked whale 
sub-population, there is still quite a bit 
of variation in occurrence and 
movement of beaked whales within a 
given basin (Schorr et al., 2017, 2018, 
2020). The small area around Santa 
Barbara Island is not known to have 
resident marine mammals, formally 
identified BIAs (or watch areas formally 
identified in Calambokidis et al. (2024), 
though the authors note that some areas, 
including the San Nicolas Basin, appear 
to have higher densities of beaked 
whales, and future consideration as a 
BIA may be warranted), nor is it 
identified as a breeding or persistent 
foraging location for cetaceans. Instead, 
the same marine mammals that range 
throughout the offshore Southern 
California area could pass at some point 
through the marine waters of Santa 
Barbara Island. In addition to the 
limited benefit to beaked whales if this 
mitigation area were required, 
restrictions beyond what is already 
proposed would be impractical because 
it would modify military readiness 
activities in a way that would prevent 
them from meeting mission objectives 
and hinder Navy ability to realistically 
train and test in furtherance of its 
statutory mandate. As such, NMFS is 
not requiring the Navy to continue the 
former Santa Barbara Island Mitigation 
Area, consistent with the proposed rule. 
The water space areas mentioned in 
the comment as ‘‘(SHOBA)’’ off the 
southern end of San Clemente Island are 
waters designated as Federal Danger and 
Safety Zones via formal rule making 
(Danger Zone—33 CFR 334.950 and 
Safety Zone—33 CFR 165.1141) because 
they are adjacent to the shore 
bombardment impact area that is on 
land at the southern end of San 
Clemente Island. Waters designated as 
‘‘WILSON COVE’’ on the leeward 
norther side of San Clemente Island 
south of Safety Zone Area A are 
associated with the Wilson Cove 
anchorages and moorings, where ship 
calibration tests, sonobuoy lot testing, 
and special projects take place, are 
designated as Federal Safety and 
Restricted Zones via formal rule making 
(Safety Zone—33 CFR 165.1141 and 
Restricted Zone—33 CFR 334.920). 
The commenter expressed concern 
that a population of goose-beaked whale 
is, ‘‘subject to regular acoustic 
disturbance due to the presence of the 
Shore Bombardment Area,’’ is not 
correct. The SHOBA is a naval gun 
impact area located on land at the 
southern end of San Clemente Island. 
This area is an instrumented land 
training range used for a variety of 
bombardment training and testing 
activities. The in-water administrative 
boundary for SHOBA does not delineate 
the locations where a vessel firing at 
land targets must be located and does 
not represent where gunfire rounds are 
targeted. The water area in Santa 
Catalina Basin is a controlled safety 
zone in the very unlikely event a round 
goes over the island and lands in the 
water. With the modern advent of better 
precision munitions, computers, and 
advanced fire control, that probability is 
very remote. Navy vessels use the 
waters south of San Clemente Island 
(SHOBA West and SHOBA East) from 
which to fire into land targets on 
southern San Clemente Island. 
Therefore, there would not be any 
underwater acoustic disturbance to 
goose-beaked whales located within the 
Santa Catalina Basin from in-water 
explosives or ship firing. Goose-beaked 
whales are unlikely to occur in the 
shallow waters of the Pyramid Cove 
Mine Training Range where these 
stressors would occur. 
The Navy has been funding goose- 
beaked whale research and monitoring 
in SOCAL since 2004. This research 
includes information related to overall 
beaked whale population health such as 
individual re-sighting rates, passive 
acoustic detections on occurrence, 
documentations of mother-calf pairs, 
satellite tracking, genetics, and starting 
in 2025, body condition analysis using 
drone photographs. In addition, 
numerous opportunistic exposure 
response studies are ongoing. To date, 
no documentation of harm to 
individuals or populations has been 
observed over 20 years of monitoring. 
Further, the Navy, in consultation with 
NMFS, has already begun planning the

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258834 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations development of a Potential Consequence 
of Disturbance (PCOD) model for 
SOCAL goose-beaked whales based on 
past and ongoing data collection efforts. 
Rather than convening a mitigation- 
focused panel as recommended by the 
commenter, NMFS and the Navy will 
consider the outcome of this model and 
whether model results suggest that 
additional mitigation measures for 
beaked whales may be warranted. 
In Southern California, the goose- 
beaked whales that may be impacted by 
the Action Proponents’ training and 
testing are of the California/Oregon/ 
Washington stock, and NMFS has 
appropriately made its negligible impact 
finding for this stock, as described in 
the Analysis and Negligible Impact 
Determination section of this final rule. 
Please see NMFS response to 
Comment 30 regarding signal 
modification. Aside from signal 
modification, the commenter did not 
recommend specific source-based 
mitigation approaches. 
Comment 44 (ref 64): A commenter 
recommended that NMFS require a 
year-round mitigation area to protect the 
Cross Seamount, given that it represents 
important foraging habitat for a rare and 
potentially evolutionary distinct species 
of beaked whale. The commenter stated 
that such a designation would have 
secondary benefits for a variety of other 
odontocete species foraging at Cross 
Seamount seasonally between 
November and May. The commenter 
further recommended considering 
habitat-based management measures for 
other nearby seamounts given the 
scientific basis for the generalization of 
marine mammal-seamount associations, 
and given evidence that a number of 
other seamounts within the HCTT Study 
Area exhibit levels of productivity 
capable of supporting commercial 
fisheries. 
Response: Analysis and consideration of Cross Seamount and ‘‘other nearby 
seamounts’’ for additional geographic 
mitigation was provided in appendix K 
(Geographic Mitigation Assessment), 
section K.7.1 (Hawaii Public Comment 
Mitigation Area Assessment), including 
sub-sections K.7.1.1 (General Biological 
Assessment of Seamounts in the Hawaii 
Portion of the Study Area) and K.7.1.2 
(Cross Seamount) of the 2018 HSTT EIS/ 
OEIS. 
As discussed in appendix K 
(Geographic Mitigation Assessment), 
section 4.7.1.3 (Mitigation Assessment) 
of the 2018 HSTT EIS/OEIS, 
implementing new geographic 
mitigation measures in addition to 
ongoing procedural mitigation within 
the vicinity of Cross Seamount would 
not be effective at reducing adverse 
impacts on beaked whales or other 
marine mammal populations. The Navy 
has been training and testing in the 
broad ocean area around Cross 
Seamount with the same basic systems 
for over 40 years, and there is no 
evidence of any adverse impacts to 
marine species. Additionally, the 
suggested mitigation would not be 
practicable to implement. The broad 
ocean area around Cross Seamount and 
the seamounts to the north are unique 
in that there are no similar broad ocean 
areas in the vicinity of the Hawaiian 
Islands that are not otherwise 
encumbered by commercial vessel 
traffic and commercial air traffic routes. 
In addition, beaked whales may be more 
widely distributed than currently 
believed. Ongoing passive acoustic 
efforts from NMFS and Navy within the 
Pacific have documented beaked whale 
detections at many locations beyond 
slopes and seamounts to include areas 
over abyssal plains (Klinck et al., 2015; 
Griffiths and Barlow, 2016; Rice et al., 
2018). 
Comment 45 (ref 65): A commenter 
stated that NMFS should further 
consider implementing mitigation areas 
off Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau. The 
commenter stated that providing 
mitigation measures for select activities 
during even a limited season within 
some important habitat areas could have 
value in reducing cumulative 
disturbance and stress in resident 
populations. 
Response: In the 2025 HCTT EIS/ OEIS, the Action Proponents considered 
the science, the military readiness 
requirements, and the effectiveness of 
identified habitat areas off Oahu, Kauai, 
and Niihau as presented in appendix K 
(Geographic Mitigation Assessment) 
section K.3 (Biologically Important 
Areas within the Hawaii Study Area). 
This includes the identified BIAs off 
Oahu (humpback whale, Blainville’s 
beaked whale, false killer whale, short- 
finned pilot whale, pygmy killer whale, 
pantropical spotted dolphin, rough- 
toothed dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, 
and spinner dolphin), BIAs off Kauai 
and Niihau (humpback whale, short- 
finned pilot whale, false killer whale, 
rough-toothed dolphin, spinner 
dolphin, and bottlenose dolphin), and 
BIAs off Lanai and Molokai (humpback 
whale, Blainville’s beaked whale, goose- 
beaked whale, short-finned pilot whale, 
false killer whale, pygmy killer whale, 
pantropical spotted dolphin, rough- 
toothed dolphin, bottlenose dolphin and 
spinner dolphin). 
There is no evidence to suggest there 
have been any population-level effects 
in the waters around Oahu, Kauai, 
Niihau, Lanai, or Molokai or in the 
HCTT Study Area resulting from the 
same training and testing activities that 
have been ongoing for decades. In the 
waters around Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau, 
documented long-term residency by 
individuals and the existence of 
multiple small and resident populations 
precisely where Navy training and 
testing have been occurring for decades 
suggests a lack of significant impact to 
those populations from the continuation 
of Navy training and testing. Appendix 
K of the HCTT EIS/OEIS describes the 
importance of these areas for Navy 
training and testing and why 
implementation of additional mitigation 
areas would be impracticable. As such, 
NMFS is not requiring the Action 
Proponents to implement an additional 
mitigation area in this region. Of note, 
the Navy’s monitoring program for 
Hawaii is currently exclusively focused 
on monitoring whale and select dolphin 
species off Kauai and Niihau since 2009. 
In 2025, the Navy will be adding 
increased effort for rough-toothed 
dolphins due to the new BIA 
designation (Kratofil et al., 2023). 
Comment 46 (ref 59, 60): A 
commenter recommended that NMFS 
extend the reporting period to December 
1 through May 1 for the Hawaii 
Humpback Whale Special Reporting 
Mitigation Area. The commenter also 
recommended that NMFS require 
reporting of other sources of MFAS and 
LFAS in the mitigation area. 
Response: The proposed rule required that the Action Proponents must report 
the total hours of MF1 and MF1C 
surface ship hull-mounted MFAS used 
from November through May in the 
Hawaii Humpback Whale Special 
Reporting Mitigation Area in their 
training and testing activity reports 
submitted to NMFS. As such, the 
proposed time period already includes 
that recommended by the commenter, 
and no change to the time period is 
warranted in this final rule. Regarding 
the reporting of other sources, MF1 
surface ship hull-mounted MFAS was 
chosen as the representative source to 
report because it is a well-understood 
source in terms of its effects on marine 
mammals, extensively used during 
training and testing activities, and has 
not changed significantly since the 
initial Navy training and testing ITAs. 
For consistency of reporting, retention 
of MF1 hours as the reporting metric 
will allow for clear comparison to past 
documents. NMFS does not find it 
necessary for the Action Proponents to 
report other forms of MFAS and LFAS. 
Comment 47 (ref 61): A commenter 
recommended that the Action 
Proponents begin issuing awareness 
notification messages from November 1 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  19:02 Dec 16, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\17DER2.SGM 17DER2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258835 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations through May 31, overlapping the 
effective period of the reproductive BIA 
for humpback whales (December 1 
through May 31), and beginning in 
November 1 as initially proposed to 
support the detection of early arriving 
humpback whales to the HRC. 
Response: The Action Proponents have indicated that extending the date 
range for the Hawaii Humpback Whale 
Awareness Messages from November 1 
through May 31 is practicable, and as 
such, NMFS has updated the required 
date range for these messages in this 
final rule. 
Comment 48 (ref 28): The 
Commission recommended that NMFS: 
€Clearly separate its application of the least practicable adverse impact 
requirement from its negligible impact 
determination; 
€Adopt a clear decision-making framework that recognizes the species 
and stock component and the marine 
mammal habitat component of the least 
practicable adverse impact provision 
and always consider whether there are 
potentially adverse impacts on marine 
mammal habitat and whether it is 
practicable to minimize them; 
€Rework its evaluation criteria for applying the least practicable adverse 
impact standard to separate the factors 
used to determine whether a potential 
impact on marine mammals or their 
habitat is adverse and whether possible 
mitigation measures would be effective; 
€Address these concerns by adopting a simple, two-step analysis that more 
closely tracks the statutory provisions 
being implemented and, if NMFS is 
using some other legal standard to 
implement the least practicable adverse 
impact requirements, provide a clear 
and concise description of that standard 
and explain why it believes it to be 
‘‘sufficient’’ to meet the statutory legal 
requirements; and 
€Apply these basic steps and criteria consistently for least practicable adverse 
impact determinations across incidental 
take authorizations. 
The Commission references previous 
letters in which it has included its 
complete rationale for these 
recommendations. 
Response: NMFS has made clear in this and other rules that the agency 
separates its application of the least 
practicable adverse impact requirement 
in the Mitigation Measures section from 
its negligible impact analyses and 
determinations for each species or stock 
in the Analysis and Negligible Impact 
Determination section. Further, NMFS 
has made this separation clear in 
practice for years by requiring 
mitigation measures to reduce impacts 
to marine mammal species and stocks 
and their habitat for all projects, even 
those for which the anticipated take 
would clearly have a negligible impact, 
even in the absence of mitigation. 
In the Mitigation Measures section of 
this rule, NMFS has explained in detail 
our interpretation of the least 
practicable adverse impact standard, the 
rationale for our interpretation, and how 
we implement the standard. The 
method the agency uses addresses all of 
the necessary components of the 
standard and produces effective 
mitigation measures that result in the 
least practicable adverse impact on both 
the species or stocks and their habitat. 
The commenter has failed to explain 
why NMFS’ approach is inadequate or 
why the commenter’s proposed 
approach would be better. We, 
therefore, decline to accept the 
recommendation. 
Also in the Mitigation Measures 
section, NMFS has explained in detail 
our application of the least practicable 
adverse impact standard. The 
commenter recommended an alternate 
way of interpreting and implementing 
the least practicable adverse impact 
standard, in which NMFS would 
consider the effectiveness of a measure 
in our evaluation of its practicability. 
The commenter erroneously asserts that 
NMFS currently considers the 
effectiveness of a measure in a 
determination of whether the potential 
effects of an activity are adverse, but the 
commenter has misunderstood NMFS’ 
application of the standard—rather, 
NMFS appropriately considers the 
effectiveness of a measure in the 
evaluation of the degree to which a 
measure will reduce adverse impacts on 
marine mammal species or stocks and 
their habitat, as a less effective measure 
will less successfully reduce these 
impacts on marine mammals. Further, 
the commenter has not provided 
information that shows that their 
proposed approach would more 
successfully evaluate mitigation under 
the least practicable adverse impact 
standard, and we decline to accept it. 
Further, NMFS disagrees with the 
commenter’s assertion that analysis of 
the rule’s mitigation measures under the 
least practicable adverse impact 
standard remains unclear or that the 
suggested shortcomings exist. The 
commenter provides no rationale as to 
why the two-step process they describe 
is better than the process that NMFS 
uses to evaluate the least practicable 
adverse impact that is described in the 
rule, and therefore we decline to accept 
the recommendation. 
Regarding the assertion that the 
standard shifts on a case-by-case basis, 
the commenter misunderstands NMFS’ 
process. Neither the least practicable 
adverse impact standard nor NMFS’ 
process for evaluating it shifts on a case- 
by-case basis. Rather, as the commenter 
suggests should be the case, the 
evaluation itself is case-specific to the 
proposed activity, the predicted 
impacts, and the mitigation under 
consideration. 
Regarding the recommendation to 
apply the recommended steps and 
criteria for least practicable adverse 
impact determinations across incidental 
take authorizations, as outlined above, 
NMFS disagrees with these 
recommendations and therefore does 
not intend to apply them across 
incidental take authorizations. 
Comment 49 (ref 86, 87, 88): A 
commenter stated that NMFS wholesale 
endorses the Action Proponents’ 
decision to reject additional mitigation 
measures considered in the 2024 HCTT 
Draft EIS/OEIS and provides no 
independent justification or analysis for 
its least practicable adverse impact 
determination. The commenter stated 
that without incorporating a broader 
suite of mitigation measures, including, 
for example, mandatory reduced vessel 
speeds and updated geographic 
mitigation areas based on updated 
science, the ITRs and LOAs violate the 
MMPA’s requirement to incorporate 
mitigation measures that effectuate the 
least practicable adverse impact. The 
commenter further stated that although 
NMFS acknowledges the existence of 
the updated BIAs (Calambokidis et al., 
2024; Harrison et al., 2023; Kratofil et 
al., 2023) in its proposed rule, NMFS makes clear that it plans to adopt the 
Action Proponents’ proposed 
geographic mitigation areas without any 
changes, claiming that it is ‘‘heavily 
reliant on the Action Proponents’ 
description of operational 
practicability.’’ 
The commenter additionally stated 
that NMFS failed to require the 
following additional mitigation 
measures proposed in its Draft EIS/OEIS 
comments: 
€Imposing a 10-kn (18.5 km/hr) ship speed limit in whale mitigation areas to 
reduce the risk of vessel strikes; 
€Improving detection of marine mammals using alternative detection 
methods including thermal and acoustic 
methods (Verfuss et al., 2018); 
€Restricting activities during times of low visibility; 
€Capping the maximum level of activities each year; 
€Avoiding testing and training exercises in key migration corridors and 
prime feeding areas; 
€Avoiding testing and training exercises during key feeding times;

presence in the area is ‘‘High’’ or ‘‘Very 
High,’’ per WhaleSafe; 
€Maintaining mitigation for the core feeding areas for Blue Whales in the San 
Nicolas Island Mitigation Area; 
€Prohibiting sonar and explosives in all the whale mitigation areas off 
California from June through November; 
and 
€Not exempting aircraft from mitigation areas. 
Response: NMFS disagrees with much of what the commenters assert. First, we 
have carefully explained our 
interpretation of the least practicable 
adverse impact standard and how it 
applies to both stocks and individuals 
in the Mitigation Measures section of 
the proposed rule and this final rule. 
Further, we have applied the standard 
correctly in this rule by requiring 
measures that reduce impacts to 
individual marine mammals in a 
manner that reduces the probability 
and/or severity of population-level 
impacts. 
When a suggested or recommended 
mitigation measure that would reduce 
impacts is not practicable, NMFS has 
explored variations of that mitigation 
measure to determine if a practicable 
form of related mitigation exists. This is 
clearly illustrated in NMFS’ 
independent mitigation analysis process 
explained in the Proposed Mitigation 
Measures section of the proposed rule 
and the Mitigation Measures section of 
this final rule. First, some types of 
mitigation required under this rule are 
area-specific and vary by mitigation 
area, demonstrating that NMFS has 
engaged in a site-specific analysis to 
ensure mitigation is tailored when 
practicability demands, i.e., some forms of mitigation were practicable in some 
areas but not others. For instance, while 
it was not practicable for the Action 
Proponents to prohibit surface ship 
hull-mounted MF1 MFAS during 
training or testing in all mitigation 
areas, NMFS did include restrictions on 
its use in the Hawaii 4-Islands Marine 
Mammal Mitigation Area, Hawaii Island 
Marine Mammal Mitigation Area, 
Northern California Large Whale 
Mitigation Area, Central California 
Large Whale Mitigation Area, and the 
Southern California Blue Whale 
Mitigation Area. 
Additionally, while the Navy cannot 
alleviate all training and testing in the 
mitigation areas that protect small 
resident odontocete populations in 
Hawaii, this final rule includes an 
expansion of the Hawaii 4-Islands 
Mitigation Area to include an additional 
portion of the child small and resident 
BIA for the Main Hawaiian Islands 
Insular stock of false killer whale. This 
increases the portion of the child BIA 
overlapping the mitigation area from 
approximately 40 percent of the BIA as 
included in the proposed rule to 63 
percent. Additionally, this final rule 
clarifies that the MFAS mitigation in 
this area and in the Hawaii Island 
Marine Mammal Mitigation Area 
includes both MF1 and MF1C surface 
ship hull-mounted MFAS. MF1C was 
inadvertently left out of the Action 
Proponents application and 
subsequently the proposed rule. 
NMFS agrees the agency must 
conduct its own analysis, which it has 
done here. NMFS has not automatically 
accepted the Navy’s analysis and 
rationales. Rather, NMFS has 
appropriately reviewed the Navy’s 
analysis of effectiveness and 
practicability of its proposed mitigation 
measures, which by regulation the Navy 
was required to submit with its 
application. Based on NMFS’ 
independent review, it has concurred 
with those aspects of the Navy’s 
analysis with which NMFS agrees. 
NMFS has described our well-reasoned 
process for identifying the measures 
needed to meet the least practicable 
adverse impact standard in the 
Mitigation Measures section in this rule, 
and we have followed the approach 
described there when analyzing 
potential mitigation for the Action 
Proponents’ activities in the HCTT 
Study Area. 
Regarding restricting activities during 
times of low visibility, anti-submarine 
warfare training involving the use of 
MFAS typically involves the periodic 
use of active sonar to develop the 
‘‘tactical picture,’’ or an understanding 
of the battle space (e.g., area searched or unsearched, presence of false contacts, 
and an understanding of the water 
conditions). Developing the tactical 
picture can take several hours or days, 
and typically occurs over vast waters 
with varying environmental and 
oceanographic conditions. Training 
during both high visibility (e.g., 
daylight, favorable weather conditions) 
and low visibility (e.g., nighttime, inclement weather conditions) is vital 
because sonar operators must be able to 
understand the environmental 
differences between day and night and 
varying weather conditions and how 
they affect sound propagation and the 
detection capabilities of sonar. 
Temperature layers move up and down 
in the water column and ambient noise 
levels can vary significantly between 
night and day, affecting sound 
propagation and how sonar systems are 
operated. Reducing or securing power in 
low-visibility conditions as a mitigation 
would affect a commander’s ability to 
develop the tactical picture and would 
prevent sonar operators from training in 
realistic conditions. Further, during 
integrated training multiple vessels and 
aircraft may participate in an exercise 
using different dimensions of warfare 
simultaneously (e.g., submarine warfare, surface warfare, air warfare). If one of 
these training elements were adversely 
impacted (e.g., if sonar training reflecting military operations were not 
possible), the training value of other 
integrated elements would also be 
degraded. Additionally, failure to test 
such systems in realistic military 
operational scenarios increases the 
likelihood these systems could fail 
during military operations, thus 
unacceptably placing sailors’ lives and 
the Nation’s security at risk. Some 
systems have a nighttime testing 
requirement; therefore, these tests 
cannot occur only in daylight hours. 
Reducing or securing power in low 
visibility conditions would decrease the 
Navy’s ability to determine whether 
systems are operationally effective, 
suitable, survivable, and safe for their 
intended use by the fleet even in 
reduced visibility or difficult weather 
conditions. 
Regarding the recommendation to cap 
the maximum level of activities each 
year, the commenters offer no rationale 
for why a cap is needed and nor do they 
suggest what an appropriate cap might 
be. The Action Proponents are 
responsible under Titles 10 (Navy) and 
14 (Coast Guard) of the U.S. Code for 
conducting the needed amount of 
testing and training to maintain military 
readiness, which is what they have 
proposed and NMFS has analyzed. 
Further, the MMPA states that NMFS 
shall issue MMPA authorizations if the 
necessary findings can be made, as they 
have been here. Importantly, as 
described in the Geographic Mitigation 
Areas section, the Navy will limit activities (active sonar, explosive use, 
etc.) to varying degrees in multiple areas 
that are important to sensitive species or 
for important behaviors in order to 
minimize impacts that are more likely to 
lead to adverse effects on rates of 
recruitment or survival. 
NMFS and the Action Proponents 
have fully explored the potential to 
incorporate WhaleSafe into the required 
mitigation measures. However, the 
current WhaleSafe operational areas 
(Santa Barbara Channel and off the coast 
of San Francisco) do not overlap with 
the HCTT Study Area. As such, while 
WhaleSafe can inform whale occurrence 
in other areas of California, it is not an 
appropriate tool for determining

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258837 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations mitigation actions in the HCTT Study 
Area, and NMFS has not required the 
Navy to halt training or testing activities 
when WhaleSafe indicates that whale 
presence in the area is ‘‘high’’ or ‘‘very 
high’’ as suggested by the commenter. 
Aircraft are not exempt from mitigation 
areas. As detailed in section 5.7 of the 
2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS, several 
geographic mitigation areas have 
proposed requirements which apply to 
aircraft (e.g., restrictions or prohibitions on explosive use, an annual cap on 
dipping sonar). 
Please see NMFS’ response to 
Comment 50 regarding vessel speed 
restrictions, Comment 31 and Comment 32 regarding use of thermal detection and passive acoustic monitoring, 
Comment 35 regarding avoiding testing 
and training in key migration corridors 
and prime feeding areas and times, 
Comment 36 regarding the 
recommended San Nicolas Island 
Mitigation Area, and Comment 35, 
Comment 36, Comment 37, and 
Comment 38 regarding prohibition of 
sonar and explosives in whale 
mitigation areas off California from June 
through November. 
Comment 50 (ref 71): A commenter 
stated that it urges NMFS to conduct a 
thorough practicability analysis, as has 
been demonstrated for the Atlantic Fleet 
Training and Testing Study Area, and to 
implement vessel speed mitigation 
measures in the HCTT Study Area. 
Additionally, given that the speed of 
Navy vessels during all aspects of their 
operations potentially impacts marine 
mammals, the commenter 
recommended that NMFS require data 
collection and reporting on vessel speed 
as part of the rulemaking process. The 
commenter states that this will allow for 
objective evaluation by NMFS of vessel- 
strike risk, of harassment resulting from 
vessel activity, and of the potential 
benefit of additional speed-focused 
mitigation measures. 
Response: The Action Proponents assert that vessel speed restrictions are 
not practicable given safety, 
sustainability, and mission criteria. The 
Navy requires flexibility in use of 
variable ship speeds for training, testing, 
operational, safety, and engineering 
qualification requirements. Navy ships 
typically use the lowest speed practical 
given individual mission needs. NMFS 
has reviewed the analysis of these 
additional suggested restrictions and the 
impacts they would have on military 
readiness and concurs with the Navy’s 
assessment that they are impracticable 
(see row 16 of table 5–20 in chapter 5 
of the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS). Given the 
practicability concerns, this final rule 
does not require speed restrictions in 
the HCTT Study Area generally or in 
specific mitigation areas. However, 
activity-based mitigation for manned 
surface vessels requires maneuvering 
vessels to maintain a specified distance 
from marine mammals, which may 
include reducing speed. 
In a review of Navy unpublished data, 
the multi-year average of U.S. Navy 
surface vessel speeds on the continental 
shelf off California is between 10–15 kn 
(18.5–27.8 km/hr). There has not been a 
known U.S. Navy vessel strike to whales 
in Hawaii since the Navy began 
requesting ITAs under the MMPA in 
2009. 
Regarding a practicability analysis 
comparable to AFTT, such an analysis 
was possible for the AFTT Study Area 
because of a civilian North Atlantic 
right whale notification system 
applicable to only a small area of the 
AFTT Study Area. Similar systems do 
not exist in the Pacific. 
Regarding reporting of vessel speed, 
as required through the Notification and 
Reporting Plan, Action Proponent 
vessels are required to report extensive 
information, including vessel speed, 
pursuant to any marine mammal vessel 
strikes. Therefore, the data required for 
vessel strike analysis discussed in the 
comment is already being collected. 
Any additional data collection 
requirement would create an 
unnecessary burden on the Action 
Proponents. Adverse impacts from 
vessel noise are not anticipated to result 
from the Action Proponents’ activities 
(see the Potential Effects of Specified 
Activities on Marine Mammals and 
Their Habitat section in the proposed 
rule), there is no anticipated harassment 
caused by vessel activity, and therefore, 
no need to collect and report data on 
vessel speed for this purpose. 
Comment 51 (ref 27): The 
Commission recommended that the 
NMFS final rule require the Action 
Proponents to follow established 
incident reporting procedures and halt 
any active acoustic, explosive, pile- 
driving, or air gun activity if a marine 
mammal is injured or killed during or 
immediately after the activity and 
require the Action Proponents to 
consult with NMFS to review or adapt 
the mitigation measures, as necessary. 
Response: The proposed rule and this final rule include a requirement for the 
Action Proponents to follow established 
incident reporting procedures if the 
specified activity is thought to have 
resulted in the mortality or serious 
injury of any marine mammals, as 
recommended by the Commission as 
outlined in the Notification and 
Reporting Plan (note that the 
Notification and Reporting Plan also 
requires the Action Proponents to 
follow established incident reporting 
protocols for cetacean live strandings). 
Regarding the Commission’s 
recommendation to require that the 
Action Proponents halt any active 
acoustic, explosive, pile driving, or air 
gun activity if a marine mammal is 
injured or killed during or immediately 
after the activity, and require the Action 
Proponents to consult with NMFS to 
review or adapt the mitigation 
measures, as necessary, NMFS agrees 
with the recommendation to suspend 
the use of explosives in an event if a 
marine mammal is injured or killed 
during or immediately after the activity. 
Neither NMFS nor the Action 
Proponents anticipate serious injury or 
mortality from any activity other than 
the use of explosives or vessel 
movement. For all activities involving 
explosives, the final rule expressly 
requires that, if a marine mammal is 
visibly injured or killed as a result of 
detonation, use of explosives in the 
event must be suspended immediately 
(see Mitigation Measures section). While 
similar language is not included for 
active acoustics, pile driving, and air 
gun activity, the proposed rule and this 
final rule require the Action Proponents 
to power down or shut down these 
sources if a marine mammal is observed 
within the applicable mitigation zone. 
The Action Proponents will also 
continue to follow incident reporting 
procedures as outlined in the 
Notification and Reporting Plan 
(including for vessel strike, should it 
occur) and consult with NMFS to 
review or adapt the mitigation 
measures, as necessary, through the 
adaptive management process. 
Monitoring 
Comment 52 (ref 74, 75): A 
commenter stated that long-term passive 
acoustic monitoring data has proven to 
be one of the most cost-effective and 
useful signals of distribution shifts of 
marine mammals and their prey. The 
commenter states that a more extensive 
network of passive acoustic platforms 
off the U.S. West Coast, designed in a 
manner that optimized the power of the 
network to detect large-scale 
distribution shifts, would be of great 
benefit for estimating and mitigating the 
impacts of Navy training and testing (as 
well as a myriad of other human 
activities) and recommended that NMFS 
require that the Navy establish such a 
network. 
The commenter also recommended 
that NMFS require monitoring that aims 
to quantify the impact of Navy activities

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258838 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations recommended that NMFS require use of 
unmanned aerial vehicles for assessing 
marine mammal behavior before, 
during, and after Navy operations (e.g., 
swim speed and direction, group 
cohesion). The commenter stated that in 
addition, studies into how these 
technologies can be used to assess body 
condition for a broader array of marine 
mammal species should be supported, 
as this can provide an important 
indication of energy budget and health, 
which can inform the assessment of 
population-level impacts from Navy 
activities. 
Response: The U.S. Navy is the second largest Federal Agency 
contributing to marine mammal 
research behind NMFS. In Fiscal Year 
2023, the latest year with data currently 
available, the U.S. Navy cumulatively 
contributed $21.76 million to marine 
mammal research representing 26 
percent of all Federal funding that year. 
While the Navy uses passive acoustic 
devices at select areas, it is logistically 
impracticable to monitor the entire U.S. 
West Coast. The Navy’s at-sea ranges off 
the West Coast cover over 371,679 nmi
2
 
(1,274,823 km
2
). Furthermore, 
developing and maintaining an 
Integrated Ocean Observing System 
within the U.S. Exclusive Economic 
Zone (EEZ) has been and remains a 
mission area of NOAA (https://
ioos.noaa.gov/). In the Pacific Northwest 
there is the Northwest Association of 
Networked Ocean Observing Systems 
and in Southern California there is 
Southern California Coastal Ocean 
Observing System. 
The U.S. Navy funds an annual 
average of over $5,000,000 of marine 
mammal monitoring across five Pacific 
at-sea ranges. Monitoring priorities are 
determined in coordination with NMFS, 
and focus resources on key top-level 
goals including an increase in the 
understanding of how anticipated 
individual responses, to individual 
stressors or anticipated combinations of 
stressors, may impact either the long- 
term fitness and survival of an 
individual or the species or stock (e.g., 
through impacts on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival) as suggested by 
the commenter and as described in the 
Proposed Monitoring section of the 
proposed rule (90 FR 32118, July 16, 
2025). It is fiscally and logistically 
impractical to monitor every marine 
mammal species to the degree suggested 
by the commenter, and further, it is 
outside the scope of the Action 
Proponents’ responsibilities under the 
MMPA. NMFS and Navy meet annually 
to discuss the state of monitoring 
science and other adaptive management 
issues and will weigh the commenter’s 
monitoring recommendations against 
other priority topics. Of note, while the 
full scope of monitoring recommended 
by the commenter is impractical and 
outside the scope of the Action 
Proponents’ responsibilities under the 
MMPA, as stated above, targeted studies 
utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles 
(UAVs) to assess behavioral responses of 
marine mammals to sonar have been 
pursued in the past (e.g., Durban et al., 2022). 
Comment 53 (ref 75–2, 32–4): A 
commenter recommended that NMFS 
include, as part of its monitoring 
requirements, application of simpler 
modeling methods that could provide at 
least an indication of greater than 
negligible impacts, even if each of the 
behavioral and physiological 
mechanisms are not fully characterized. 
The commenter states that the modeling 
approach undertaken by researchers for 
beaked whales in the California Current 
offers one such example. Here, a 
Bayesian hidden-process modeling 
approach was used to estimate 
abundance and population trends of 
beaked whales using sightings data from 
six ship-based, line-transect, cetacean 
abundance surveys between 1991 and 
2008 (Moore and Barlow, 2013). Model 
results indicated that goose-beaked 
whales were experiencing an average 
rate of decline at 2.9 percent per year. 
This commenter stated that this type of 
modeling effort will likely be most 
useful for species and stocks, like 
beaked whales, that are known to show 
site fidelity to survey areas, so that 
trends in abundance are less likely to be 
influenced by immigration or 
emigration. Additionally, the 
commenter recommended that NMFS 
require use of other proxy measures of 
changes in population-level abundance 
and demographics, in order to develop 
an early-detection system for 
populations that may be experiencing a 
decline as a result of Navy activities. 
The comparative demographic study of 
beaked whale populations in the 
Bahamas, on and off the Atlantic 
Undersea Test and Evaluation Center 
range (Kellar et al., 2015), is a cogent 
example of a study that is long overdue 
for Southern California, to understand 
the effect that repeated behavioral 
disruptions and displacement of 
foraging activity are having on the 
region’s small beaked whale 
populations, such as the goose-beaked 
whale population on SOAR. 
Another commenter recommended 
clear, enforceable adaptive management 
triggers tied to quantitative monitoring 
results. 
Response: The Navy, in consultation with NMFS, has already begun planning 
the development of a PCOD model for 
SOCAL goose-beaked whales based on 
past and ongoing data collection efforts. 
This effort integrates past and ongoing 
data collection on beaked whale 
population demographics since 2004 
(tagging, photo identification, genetics, 
body condition, response to sound). In 
addition to the population study in 
SOCAL, Navy funded researchers are 
also monitoring a non-exposed beaked 
whale population off Guadalupe Island, 
Mexico. 
The commenter’s recommendation for 
NMFS to require use of other proxy 
measures of changes in population-level 
abundance and demographics, in order 
to develop an early-detection system for 
populations that may be experiencing a 
decline as a result of Navy activities 
lacks specificity, including potential 
proxy measures, rendering it impossible 
to consider its recommendation at a 
broader level. 
It is unclear what the commenter is 
suggesting regarding clear, enforceable, 
adaptive management triggers tied to 
quantitative monitoring results. As 
described in the Adaptive Management 
section of this final rule, the reporting 
requirements associated with this final 
rule are designed to provide NMFS with 
monitoring data from the previous year 
to allow NMFS to consider whether any 
changes to existing mitigation and 
monitoring requirements are 
appropriate. The use of adaptive 
management allows NMFS to consider 
new information from different sources 
to determine (with input from the 
Action Proponents regarding 
practicability) on an annual or biennial 
basis if mitigation or monitoring 
measures should be modified (including 
additions or deletions). Mitigation 
measures could be modified if new data 
suggests that such modifications would 
have a reasonable likelihood of more 
effectively accomplishing the goals of 
the mitigation and monitoring and if the 
measures are practicable. If the 
modifications to the mitigation, 
monitoring, or reporting measures are 
substantial, NMFS would publish a 
notice of the planned LOAs in the 
Federal Register and solicit public 
comment. 
The following are some of the 
possible sources of applicable data to be 
considered through the adaptive 
management process: (1) results from 
monitoring and exercise reports, as 
required by MMPA authorizations; (2) 
compiled results of Navy-funded 
research and development studies; (3) 
results from specific stranding 
investigations; (4) results from general 
marine mammal and sound research; 
and (5) any information which reveals

Negligible Impact Determination 
Comment 54 (Ref 30): The 
Commission recommended that NMFS 
use the two-tiered approach from 
NMFS’ 2020 Criteria for Determining 
Negligible Impact under MMPA Section 
101(a)(5)(E) (NMFS, 2020), including 
using single negligible impact threshold 
(NIT
s
) instead of 10 percent of potential 
biological removal (PBR), for informing 
its negligible impact determinations that 
involve M/SI for the final rule and other 
incidental take authorizations involving 
M/SI. The Commission asserts that this 
would provide consistency with NMFS’ 
own policy directive. 
Response: As stated in the proposed rule (90 FR 32118, July 16, 2025), on 
June 17, 2020, NMFS finalized new 
Criteria for Determining Negligible 
Impact under MMPA section 
101(a)(5)(E). The guidance explicitly 
notes the differences in the negligible 
impact determinations required under 
paragraph (a)(5)(E) of section 101, as 
compared to paragraphs (a)(5)(A) and 
(D) of section 101. As stated in the 
guidance, first, they differ in terms of 
the types of take being considered and 
consequently, the effects of the takes on 
population dynamics. In paragraphs 
(a)(5)(A) and (D) of section 101, NMFS 
must determine if the taking by 
harassment, injury, or mortality (or a 
combination of these) incidental to 
specified activities will have a 
negligible impact. In section 
101(a)(5)(E), NMFS must determine if 
M/SI incidental to commercial fisheries 
will have a negligible impact. NMFS 
considers mortalities and serious 
injuries to be removals from the 
population that can be evaluated using 
well-documented models of population 
dynamics, whereas harassment and non- 
serious injury (sub-lethal taking) are not 
considered to be removals from the 
population. Second, they differ in 
whether they apply to all marine 
mammal stocks or only those stocks or 
species listed under the ESA: 
paragraphs (a)(5)(A) and (D) of section 
101 apply to all marine mammal stocks 
(regardless of ESA listing status or 
MMPA depleted status), while 
paragraph (a)(5)(E) applies only to 
stocks designated as depleted because of 
their listing under the ESA. The 
guidance further specifies that the 
procedure in that document is limited to 
how the agency conducts negligible 
impact analyses for commercial 
fisheries under section 101(a)(5)(E) (i.e., 
it is not intended to be a broad policy 
directive for M/SI analyses for all 
activities). As described in the Serious 
Injury and Mortality section of this final 
rule, when considering PBR during 
evaluation of effects of M/SI under 
section 101(a)(5)(A), we utilize a two- 
tiered analysis for each stock for which 
M/SI is proposed for authorization: 
Tier 1: Compare the total human- 
caused average annual M/SI estimate 
from all sources, including the M/SI 
proposed for authorization from the 
specific activity, to PBR. If the total M/ 
SI estimate is less than or equal to PBR, 
then the specific activity is considered 
to have a negligible impact on that 
stock. If the total M/SI estimate 
(including from the specific activity) 
exceeds PBR, conduct the Tier 2 
analysis. 
Tier 2: Evaluate the estimated M/SI 
from the specified activity relative to the 
stock’s PBR. If the M/SI from the 
specified activity is less than or equal to 
10 percent of PBR and other major 
sources of human-caused mortality have 
mitigation in place, then the individual 
specified activity is considered to have 
a negligible impact on that stock. If the 
estimate exceeds 10 percent of PBR, 
then, absent other mitigating factors, the 
specified activity could be considered 
likely to have a non-negligible impact 
on that stock. 
In this final rule, NMFS has described 
its method for considering PBR to 
evaluate the effects of potential 
mortality in the negligible impact 
analysis. NMFS has reviewed the 2020 
guidance and determined that our 
consideration of PBR in the evaluation 
of mortality, as described in the Serious 
Injury and Mortality section of the 
proposed rule and in this final rule, 
remains appropriate for use in the 
negligible impact analysis for the Action 
Proponent’s activities under section 
101(a)(5)(A). As such, NMFS disagrees 
with Commission’s recommendation to 
use NMFS (2020) to inform its negligible 
impact determinations that involve M/ 
SI. 
Comment 55 (ref 29): The 
Commission recommended that NMFS 
work with Navy to use NAEMO to 
conduct modeling of both multi-day 
events and multiple single-day events to 
estimate the number of repeated 
exposures an individual is expected to 
incur and to better assess repeated 
exposures of individuals and 
population-level consequences, rather 
than rely on what it called a qualitative 
assessment. The Commission cited 
Simmons et al. (2025) recommendation of ways that NAEMO and results from 
NAEMO could be better used to 
estimate repeated takes and population- 
level impacts. 
Response: NMFS and Navy have had ongoing discussions about how to better 
assess and characterize the number of 
repeated takes of individuals from 
training and testing activities, including 
whether NAEMO could be used to 
generate estimates of repeated takes of 
individuals. A credible assessment of 
the repeated takes due to the specified 
activities per the approach suggested in 
the comment would require treating 
animats as unique individuals over the 
course of a year’s activity and across a 
large study area, while incorporating 
migration patterns and nomadic 
movement. Such an effort would be 
computationally intensive and Navy 
anticipates that it is likely infeasible 
given reasonable resources. In contrast, 
the action analyzed by Zeddies et al. 
(2017) and referenced by the 
Commission in supporting statements 
was less complex than the specified 
activities. Thus, Zeddies et al. (2017) 
could assess repeated takes within 
spatially and temporally limited areas 
with undirected animal ingress/egress. 
NMFS will continue to work with the 
Navy to better assess and characterize 
the number of repeated takes of 
individuals. Of note, Simmons et al. 
(2025), referenced by the Commission, 
was written after a joint workshop with 
the Navy and SMRU Consulting. 
Recommendations from the workshop 
and associated report are being 
considered for future modeling 
improvements. 
While NMFS and the Action 
Proponents’ analyses could be further 
refined, the information in NMFS’ 
analysis is sufficient for assessing 
whether the authorized take would have 
a negligible impact on the species or 
stocks of marine mammals, the 
information relied upon to make this 
determination represents the best 
available science, and it is not necessary 
to have exact number of times that an 
animal is estimated to be repeatedly 
taken in order to make the negligible 
impact determination. As described in 
the Preliminary Analysis and Negligible 
Impact Determination section of the 
proposed rule (90 FR 32118, July 16, 
2025) and this final rule, generally 
speaking, the higher the number of takes 
as compared to the population 
abundance, the more repeated takes of 
individuals are likely, and the higher 
the actual percentage of individuals in 
the population that are likely taken at 
least once in a year. We look at this 
comparative metric (number of takes to 
population abundance) to give us a 
relative sense of where a larger portion

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258840 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations of a species is being taken by the 
specified activities, where there is a 
likelihood that the same individuals are 
being taken across multiple days, and 
whether the number of days might be 
higher or more likely sequential. Where 
the number of instances of take is less 
than 100 percent of the abundance, and 
there is no information to specifically 
suggest that some subset of animals is 
known to congregate in an area in which 
activities are regularly occurring (e.g., a small resident population, takes 
occurring in a known important area 
such as a BIA, or a large portion of the 
takes occurring in a certain region and 
season), the overall likelihood and 
number of repeated takes is generally 
considered low, as it could, on one 
extreme, mean that every take 
represents a separate individual in the 
population being taken on one day (a 
minimal impact to an individual) or, 
more likely, that some smaller number 
of individuals are taken on one day 
annually and some are taken on a few, 
not likely sequential, days annually, and 
of course some are not taken at all. 
In the ocean, the use of sonar and 
other active acoustic sources is often 
transient and is unlikely to repeatedly 
expose the same individual animals 
within a short period, for example 
within one specific exercise. However, 
for some individuals of some species, 
repeated exposures across different 
activities could occur over the year, 
especially where events occur in 
generally the same area with more 
resident species. In short, for some 
species, we expect that the total 
anticipated takes represent exposures of 
a smaller number of individuals of 
which some would be exposed multiple 
times, but based on the nature of the 
specified activities and the movement 
patterns of marine mammals, it is 
unlikely that individuals from most 
stocks would be taken over more than 
a few days within a given year. This 
means that even where repeated takes of 
individuals are likely to occur, they are 
more likely to result from non- 
sequential exposures from different 
activities, and, even if sequential, 
individual animals are not predicted to 
be taken for more than several days in 
a row, at most. As described elsewhere, 
the nature of the majority of the 
exposures would be expected to be of a 
less severe nature, and based on the 
numbers, it is likely that any individual 
exposed multiple times is still only 
taken on a small percentage of the days 
of the year. It is more likely that not 
every individual is taken, or perhaps a 
smaller subset is taken with a slightly 
higher average and larger variability of 
highs and lows, but still with no reason 
to think that, for most species or stocks, 
any individuals would be taken a 
significant portion of the days of the 
year. 
Comment 56: (ref EarthJustice) A 
commenter finds fault with NMFS’ 
negligible impact analysis for blue 
whales and humpback whales. 
Specifically, the commenter asserted 
that NMFS’ Tier 2 analysis for 
considering PBR during evaluation of 
effects of M/SI under MMPA section 
101(a)(5)(A) is flawed. The commenter 
states that NMFS discounts as 
‘‘negligible’’ additional impacts to 
marine mammal stocks that are already 
experiencing M/SI from other human 
sources at levels that exceed PBR, and 
that NMFS attempts to justify its view 
of relevant impacts by claiming that the 
task under the statute is to evaluate the 
impact of the applicant’s anticipated 
take on the species or stock, not the 
impact of take by other entities. The 
commenter further states that 
disregarding all other sources of M/SI 
and the resulting cumulative impacts on 
marine mammal stocks subverts the 
MMPA’s purpose to address the risks of 
‘‘extinction or depletion’’ to marine 
mammals stocks from the whole of 
‘‘man’s activities,’’ 16 U.S.C. 1361(1), 
and its directive that marine mammal 
stocks ‘‘should not be permitted to 
diminish below their optimum 
sustainable population’’ level, id. 
§ 1361(2). 
The commenter also stated that the 
analysis contradicts NMFS’ prior 
interpretations that ‘‘in order to make a 
negligible impact finding, the proposed 
incidental take must not prevent a 
depleted population from increasing 
toward its [optimum sustainable 
population; OSP] at a biologically 
acceptable rate’’ (54 FR 40338, 40341, 
September 29, 1989) and that ‘‘if a 
particular stock were known to be 
within its [OSP] range, then [NMFS] 
believes a finding of negligible impact 
can only be made if the permitted 
activities are not likely to reduce that 
stock below its [OSP]’’ (54 FR 40342, 
September 29, 1989). The commenter 
states that given that, under the MMPA, 
a proposed activity may not prevent a 
marine mammal stock from increasing 
toward its OSP or reduce the stock 
below that level, it logically follows that 
the activity cannot make a bad situation 
worse by increasing the cumulative 
level of unsustainable take ‘‘as a result 
of man’s activities.’’ 16 U.S.C. 1361(1); 
cf. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. Nat’l Marine Fisheries Serv., 524 F.3d 917, 930 (9th 
Cir. 2008) 
Response: When considering PBR during evaluation of effects of M/SI 
under MMPA section 101(a)(5)(A), 
NMFS utilizes a two-tiered analysis for 
each stock for which M/SI is proposed 
for authorization, as described in 
response to Comment 54. Additional 
detail regarding Tier 1 is available in the 
Preliminary Analysis and Negligible 
Impact Determination section of the 
proposed rule and the Analysis and 
Negligible Impact Determination section 
of this final rule. If the ongoing 
anthropogenic mortality from other 
sources already exceeds PBR, then we 
move to the Tier 2 to consider the M/ 
SI from the specific activities. 
For the Tier 2 evaluation, recognizing 
that the total annual human-caused M/ 
SI exceeds PBR, we consider whether 
the incremental effects of the proposed 
authorized M/SI for the specified 
activity, specifically, would be expected 
to result in a negligible impact on the 
affected species or stocks. For the Tier 
2 assessment, consideration of other 
factors (positive or negative), including 
those described above (e.g., the certainty in the data underlying PBR and the 
impacts of any harassment authorized 
for the specified activity), as well as the 
mitigation in place to reduce M/SI from 
other activities is especially important 
to assessing the impacts of the M/SI 
from the specified activity on the 
species or stock. PBR is a conservative 
metric and not sufficiently precise to 
serve as an absolute predictor of 
population effects upon which mortality 
caps would appropriately be based. For 
example, in some cases stock abundance 
(which is one of three key inputs into 
the PBR calculation) is underestimated 
because marine mammal survey data 
within the U.S. EEZ are used to 
calculate the abundance even when the 
stock range extends well beyond the 
U.S. EEZ. An underestimate of 
abundance could result in an 
underestimate of PBR. Alternatively, we 
sometimes may not have complete M/SI 
data beyond the U.S. EEZ to compare to 
PBR, which could result in an 
overestimate of residual PBR. The 
accuracy and certainty around the data 
that feed any PBR calculation, such as 
the abundance estimates, must be 
carefully considered to evaluate 
whether the calculated PBR accurately 
reflects the circumstances of the 
particular stock. 
As referenced above, in some cases 
the ongoing human-caused mortality 
from activities other than those being 
evaluated already exceeds PBR and, 
therefore, residual PBR is negative. We 
acknowledge that, in these cases, any 
additional mortality would result in 
greater exceedance of PBR. However, 
NMFS disagrees with the commenter’s 
assertion that NMFS’ analysis 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  19:02 Dec 16, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\17DER2.SGM 17DER2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258841 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations contradicts NMFS’ prior interpretations 
that ‘‘in order to make a negligible 
impact finding, the proposed incidental 
take must not prevent a depleted 
population from increasing toward its 
[optimum sustainable population; OSP] 
at a biologically acceptable rate’’ (54 FR 
40338, 40341, September 29, 1989) and 
that ‘‘if a particular stock were known 
to be within its [OSP] range, then 
[NMFS] believes a finding of negligible 
impact can only be made if the 
permitted activities are not likely to 
reduce that stock below its [OSP]’’ (54 
FR 40342, September 29, 1989). 
PBR is helpful in informing the 
analysis of the effects of mortality on a 
species or stock because it is important 
from a biological perspective to be able 
to consider how the total mortality in a 
given year may affect the population. 
However, section 101(a)(5)(A) of the 
MMPA indicates that NMFS shall 
authorize the requested incidental take 
from a specified activity if we find that 
‘‘the total of such taking [i.e., from the specified activity] will have a negligible 
impact on such species or stock.’’ In 
other words, the task under the statute 
is to evaluate the impact of the 
applicant’s anticipated take on the 
species or stock, not the impact of take 
by other entities. Neither the MMPA nor 
NMFS’ implementing regulations call 
for consideration of other unrelated 
activities and their impacts on the 
species or stock. The commenter finds 
fault with this interpretation of NMFS’ 
responsibility under the MMPA, 
characterizing it as a ‘‘narrow’’ view, but 
does not provide a different view or 
justify a more precautionary approach 
other than by referring generically to the 
MMPA’s overall purpose regarding risks 
of extinction of depletion to marine 
mammal stocks. 
Accordingly, we may find that the 
impacts of the taking from the specified 
activity may (alone) be negligible even 
when total human-caused mortality 
from all activities exceeds PBR (in the 
context of a particular species or stock). 
Specifically, where the authorized M/SI 
would be less than or equal to 10 
percent of PBR and management 
measures are being taken to address M/ 
SI from the other contributing activities 
(i.e., other than the specified activities covered by the incidental take 
authorization under consideration), the 
impacts of the authorized M/SI are 
appropriately considered negligible. In 
addition, we must also still determine 
that any impacts on the species or stock 
from other types of take (i.e., 
harassment) caused by the applicant do 
not combine with the impacts from 
mortality or serious injury addressed 
here to result in adverse effects on the 
species or stock through effects on 
annual rates of recruitment or survival. 
In summary, the commenter simply 
points out that total estimated annual 
M/SI for the two stocks exceeds the 
estimated PBR value, as NMFS 
acknowledges and accounts for in its 
analysis. In context of the 
considerations discussed herein, e.g., 
that the PBR value itself is not 
appropriately considered to be an 
allowable mortality ‘‘cap’’ and that 
simple exceedance of the PBR value is 
not in and of itself evidence of greater 
than negligible impact, the commenter 
does not demonstrate that in fact the 
effects of the specified activity would 
result in greater than negligible impact. 
As noted above, while PBR is useful 
in informing the evaluation of the 
effects of M/SI in MMPA section 
101(a)(5)(A) determinations, it is one 
consideration to be assessed in 
combination with other factors and is 
not determinative. For example, as 
explained above, the accuracy and 
certainty of the data used to calculate 
PBR for the species or stock must be 
considered. And we reiterate the 
considerations discussed above for why 
it is not appropriate to consider PBR an 
absolute cap in the application of this 
guidance. Accordingly, we use PBR as a 
trigger for concern while also 
considering other relevant factors to 
provide a reasonable and appropriate 
means of evaluating the effects of 
potential mortality on rates of 
recruitment and survival, while 
acknowledging that it is possible for 
total human-caused M/SI to exceed PBR 
(or for the M/SI from the specified 
activity to exceed 10 percent of PBR in 
the case where other human-caused 
mortality is exceeding PBR, as described 
in the last paragraph) and still make a 
negligible impact determination under 
MMPA section 101(a)(5)(A). 
Regarding the ESA, NMFS issued a 
biological and conference opinion on 
October 17, 2025, concluding that the 
promulgation of this rule and issuance 
of subsequent LOAs are not likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of 
threatened and endangered species 
under NMFS’ jurisdiction and are not 
likely to result in the destruction or 
adverse modification of designated or 
proposed critical habitat in the HCTT 
Study Area. 
Comment 57 (ref Earthjustice): A 
commenter disagreed with NMFS’ PBR 
analysis, in which M/SI resulting from 
the specified activity is considered 
‘‘negligible’’ if it is less than or equal to 
10 percent of PBR. The commenter 
stated that this approach fails to account 
for the context in which removals of 
species or stock would occur, citing 
species or stock abundance, 
reproductive potential, or the extent to 
which PBR is already being exceeded by 
other sources of human-caused M/SI as 
examples. The commenter provides 
specific concerns regarding the proposal 
to authorize take by M/SI of the blue 
whale (Eastern North Pacific stock) and 
the humpback whale (Central America/ 
Southern Mexico-California/Oregon/ 
Washington stock) even though other 
sources of M/SI exceed the estimated 
PBR value. 
Response: As explained in the of the Preliminary Analysis and Negligible 
Impact Determination section of the 
proposed rule and the Analysis and 
Negligible Impact Determination section 
of this final rule, if M/SI from a 
specified activity is less than or equal to 
10 percent of PBR and other major 
sources of human-caused mortality have 
mitigation in place to address the causes 
of mortality, then the individual 
specified activity is considered to have 
a negligible impact on that stock. The 
commenter is incorrect in stating that 
this method fails to consider the context 
in which removals from the species or 
stock would occur, such as species or 
stock abundance, reproductive 
potential, or the extent to which PBR is 
already being exceeded by other sources 
of human-caused M/SI as examples. As 
established by the MMPA, a stock’s PBR 
level is determined by multiplying three 
fundamental elements: (1) an estimate of 
the population’s minimum abundance; 
(2) one-half of the estimated or 
theoretical maximum rate of population 
growth for the stock, and (3) a recovery 
factor, with a value between 0.1 to 1, 
that helps ensure timely recovery. As 
such, the examples of species/stock 
abundance and reproductive potential 
cited by the commenter are explicitly 
considered in calculation of a stock’s 
PBR. Regarding consideration of the 
extent to which PBR is already being 
exceeded by other sources of human- 
caused M/SI, section 101(a)(5)(A) of the 
MMPA indicates that NMFS shall 
authorize the requested incidental take 
from a specified activity if we find that 
‘‘the total of such taking [i.e., from the specified activity] will have a negligible 
impact on such species or stock.’’ In 
other words, the task under the statute 
is to evaluate the impact of the 
applicant’s anticipated take on the 
species or stock, not the impact of take 
by other entities. Neither the MMPA nor 
NMFS’ implementing regulations call 
for consideration of other unrelated 
activities and their impacts on the 
species or stock. 
Given that the negligible impact 
determination is based on the 
assessment of take of the activity being

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258842 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations analyzed, when total annual mortality 
from human activities is higher, but the 
impacts from the specific activity being 
analyzed are very small, NMFS may still 
find the incremental impact of the 
authorized take from a specified activity 
is negligible even if total human-caused 
mortality exceeds PBR. Specifically, for 
example, if the authorized mortality is 
less than 10 percent of PBR and 
management measures are being taken 
to address serious injuries and 
mortalities from the other activities 
causing mortality (i.e., other than the specified activities covered by the 
incidental take authorization in 
consideration). 
Total annual human-caused M/SI 
exceeds PBR for both the Eastern North 
Pacific stock of blue whale and the 
Central America/Southern Mexico- 
California-Oregon-Washington stock of 
humpback whale. As such, NMFS 
conducted a Tier 2 evaluation to 
consider whether the incremental 
effects of the authorized M/SI for the 
specified activity, specifically, would be 
expected to result in a negligible impact 
on the affected species or stocks. 
Annual M/SI that may be authorized 
under this rule (representing annualized 
estimates of 7-year total M/SI for 
purposes of comparison to PBR) is 0.29 
for each of these stocks. For each stock, 
this is an insignificant incremental 
addition to total annual M/SI (18.6 and 
14.9, respectively) and is in both cases 
less than 10 percent of the PBR value 
(4.1 and 3.5, respectively). Further, 
there are management measures in place 
to address M/SI from activities other 
than those the Action Proponents are 
conducting (as discussed below). 
Based on identical simulations as 
those conducted to identify Recovery 
Factors for PBR in Wade et al. (1998), 
but where values less than 0.1 were 
investigated (P. Wade, pers. comm.), we 
predict that where the mortality from a 
specified activity does not exceed N
min
 
* 
1
2Rmax * 0.013 (where N
min
is the 
minimum abundance estimate), the 
contemplated mortality for the specific 
activity will not delay the time to 
recovery by more than 1 percent. For the 
Eastern North Pacific stock of blue 
whales, N
min
* 
1
2Rmax * 0.013 = 0.459. 
The annual mortality authorized is 0.29 
(i.e., less than 0.459). For the Central America/Southern Mexico CA/OR/WA 
stock of humpback whales, N
min
* 
1
2 
Rmax * 0.013 = 0.684. The annual 
mortality authorized is 0.29 (i.e., less than 0.684). This means that the 
mortality authorized in this rule for 
HCTT activities will not delay the time 
to recovery to OSP by more than 1 
percent for either stock. 
The primary source of total M/SI for 
the Eastern North Pacific stock of blue 
whale is vessel strike (18 per year). For 
the Central America/Southern Mexico- 
California-Oregon-Washington stock of 
humpback whale, the following are the 
top sources of M/SI: (1) vessel strike 
(6.45); (2) unidentified fishery 
interactions (3.52); and (3) California 
Dungeness Crab pot fishery (2.01). As 
such, vessel strike is the primary cause 
for exceedance of PBR for both stocks. 
NMFS disagrees with the 
commenter’s assertion that there is not 
meaningful, effective mitigation for 
vessel strike risk to these stocks in 
place, and that the voluntary vessel 
speed reduction (VSR), discussed 
below, does nothing to mitigate take 
near San Francisco. Redfern et al. (2013) 
note that the riskiest area for blue 
whales is the Santa Barbara Channel, 
where shipping lanes intersect with 
common feeding areas, and Berman- 
Kowalewski et al. (2010) state that southern California and off San 
Francisco is where most observed blue 
whale vessel strikes have occurred. 
NOAA annually issues voluntary vessel 
speed reduction (VSR) requests that are 
scheduled to be in effect May 1 to 
December 31 off San Francisco, 
Monterey, and Southern California 
within and near Greater Farallones, 
Cordell Bank, Monterey Bay, Chumash 
Heritage and Channel Islands national 
marine sanctuaries and in partnership 
with the Blue Whales Blue Skies 
program (note that in 2025, the 
Southern California VSR was extended 
in 2025 to cover Chumash Heritage 
NMS). Vessels transiting the area from 
May 1 through December 31, 2025 are 
recommended to exercise caution and 
voluntarily reduce speed to 10 kn (18.5 
km/hr) or less for blue, humpback, and 
fin whales. 
The Channel Islands NMS staff 
coordinates, collects, and monitors 
whale sightings in and around the VSR 
zones and the Channel Islands NMS 
region. The seasonally established 
Southern California VSR zone spans 
from Point Arguello to Dana Point, 
including the Traffic Separation 
Schemes in the Santa Barbara Channel 
and San Pedro Channel. Channel Island 
NMS observers collect information from 
aerial surveys conducted by NOAA, the 
U.S. Coast Guard, California Department 
of Fish and Game, and U.S. Navy 
chartered aircraft. Information on 
seasonal presence, movement, and 
general distribution patterns of large 
whales is shared with mariners, NMFS, 
U.S. Coast Guard, California Department 
of Fish and Game, the Santa Barbara 
Museum of Natural History, the Marine 
Exchange of Southern California, and 
whale scientists. Real time and 
historical whale observation data 
collected from multiple sources can be 
viewed on the Point Blue Whale 
Database. 
The VSR is voluntary, and Morten et 
al. (2022), cited by the commenter, note that cooperation with the VSR ‘‘has 
been lower than estimated to be needed 
to reduce vessel-strike related mortality 
to levels that do not inhibit reaching 
and maintaining optimal sustainable 
populations.’’ However, the Blue 
Whales Blue Skies program states that 
enrollment and cooperation rates from 
participating shipping lines have 
increased every year since the program 
began in 2014. The program further 
estimates that risk of fatal vessel strikes 
to endangered whales was reduced by 
approximately 50 percent in 2024. As 
such, while vessel strike risk is not 
eliminated by these measures, the risk is 
significantly reduced by this meaningful 
mitigation scheme. 
Regarding mortality from fishery 
interactions, as noted by the commenter, 
the scope of the new West Coast Take 
Reduction Team has been updated and 
no longer includes some fisheries 
initially planned for inclusion. The 
current preliminary scope of the Team 
includes two strategic marine mammal 
stocks (i.e., Central America/Southern Mexico and Mainland Mexico stocks of 
humpback whales) and the Federal 
sablefish pot fishery. Additional 
information is available on NMFS’ 
website at: https://
www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/ 
marine-mammal-protection/west-coast- 
take-reduction-team. 
The commenter also states in its letter 
that NMFS makes no mention of M/SI 
from unidentified fishery interactions, 
which make up the second-highest 
cause of M/SI Central America/Southern 
Mexico- California-Oregon-Washington 
stock of humpback whale (estimated at 
3.52) (fisheries-related mortality is an 
insignificant incremental addition to 
total mortality for blue whales which, as 
noted above, is almost entirely driven 
by vessel strike). However, as stated 
above, if M/SI from a specified activity 
is less than or equal to 10 percent of 
PBR and other major sources of human- 
caused mortality have mitigation in 
place, then the individual specified 
activity is considered to have a 
negligible impact on that stock. As such, 
while there are not currently mitigation 
measures in place for the fisheries of 
greatest concern for these humpback 
whale stocks, as described above, 
effective efforts to mitigate impacts from 
vessel strike, the primary threat to this 
stock and to Eastern North Pacific blue 
whales, are in place.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258843 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations As indicated in the Analysis and 
Negligible Impact Determination section 
of this final rule, we do not expect lethal 
take from Action Proponents’ activities, 
alone, to adversely affect Eastern North 
Pacific blue whales or Central America/ 
Southern Mexico-California-Oregon- 
Washington stock of humpback whales 
through effects on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival. Nonetheless, 
the fact that total human-caused 
mortality exceeds PBR necessitates close 
attention to the remainder of the 
impacts (i.e., harassment) on both stocks from the Action Proponents’ activities to 
ensure that the total authorized takes 
have a negligible impact on the species 
or stock. This analysis occurs in the 
Group and Species-Specific Analyses 
section of this final rule. While the 
commenter asserted that these takes by 
harassment can lead to population-level 
effects, it did not support this assertion 
except by reiterating broad points that 
NMFS has already considered in its 
Preliminary Analysis and Negligible 
Impact Determination section of the 
proposed rule and Analysis and 
Negligible Impact Determination section 
of this final rule. 
Changes From the Proposed Rule to the 
Final Rule 
Since publication of the proposed 
rule, U.S. Navy vessels have 
incidentally struck two large whales in 
waters off Southern California, one on 
July 15, 2025, and one on August 10, 
2025. Using the same methodology as 
discussed in Estimated Take from 
Vessel Strike by Serious Injury or 
Mortality section of the proposed rule 
and recent vessel strike information, the 
Navy reanalyzed the potential for vessel 
strikes of large whales and requested an 
increase in the authorized take from five 
to seven large whales by M/SI by vessel 
strike incidental to Navy training and 
testing activities. The Coast Guard’s 
requested take authorization remained 
unchanged at two large whales by M/SI 
by vessel strike incidental to Coast 
Guard training activities. NMFS concurs 
with the Action Proponents’ assessment 
and authorizes the take by M/SI by 
vessel strike of up to seven large whales 
by the Navy and two large whales by the 
Coast Guard (nine large whales total) 
over the 7-year period covered by this 
final rule upon finding the total take 
will have a negligible impact on the 
affected marine mammal species/stock. 
Further, since publication of the final 
rule, the Navy has clarified that rather 
than 35 missile, rocket, and drone 
launches and 3 artillery events (38 total) 
on average per year at PMRF, there will 
be an estimated 20 missile launches and 
3 artillery events (23 total) per year. The 
drone and rocket launch events 
referenced in the proposed rule will 
occur from a launch area farther away 
from monk seal haul outs, and no take 
is anticipated from these launches. 
NMFS has re-estimated the take 
associated with launches at PMRF, 
including a change to the take 
estimation method, as described in the 
Estimated Take of Marine Mammals 
section of this final rule. NMFS is 
authorizing 360 takes by Level B 
harassment of Hawaiian monk seal 
annually from missile launches and 
artillery events, an increase from that 
included in the proposed rule. 
This final rule includes an expansion 
of the Hawaii 4-Islands Mitigation Area 
to include an additional portion of the 
child small and resident BIA for the 
Main Hawaiian Islands Insular stock of 
false killer whale, following an updated 
proposal from the Action Proponents 
that resulted from ESA section 7 
consultation. This increases the portion 
of the child BIA overlapping the 
mitigation area from approximately 40 
percent of the BIA as included in the 
proposed rule to 63 percent. 
Additionally, this final rule clarifies that 
the MF active sonar mitigation in this 
area, the Hawaii Island Marine Mammal 
Mitigation Area, and the Humpback 
Whale Special Reporting Mitigation 
Area includes both MF1 and MF1C 
surface ship hull-mounted MF active 
sonar. MF1C was inadvertently left out 
of the Action Proponents application 
and subsequently the proposed rule. 
The Action Proponents have 
indicated that extending the date ranges 
for the Hawaii Humpback Whale 
Awareness Messages from November 1 
through May 31 and the California Large 
Whale Awareness Message Mitigation 
Area from November through June, as 
recommended by commenters, is 
practicable, and as such, NMFS has 
updated the required date ranges for 
these messages in this final rule. 
The Action Proponents have also 
proposed a modification to the 
California Large Whale Real-Time 
Notification Mitigation Area 
requirements. In the proposed rule, an 
aggregation of large whales was 
considered to be four large whales 
within 1 nmi (1.9 km)). This final rule 
considers an aggregation of large whales 
to be three large whales within 1 nmi 
(1.9 km). Additionally, the following 
information will be provided by the 
Navy in the Annual HCTT Training and 
Testing Reports: date, time and general 
location of the whales when the 
aggregation was first sighted, and the 
total number of whales in the 
aggregation. If the whales are identified 
by species, that information will be 
provided as well. 
Regarding activity-based mitigation, 
this final rule clarifies that the Navy 
must implement soft start techniques for 
impact pile driving. Of note, the Navy 
continues to consider soft-start 
procedures as part of their standard 
operating procedures, and as such, they 
are not listed as a mitigation measure in 
the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS. 
This final rule includes a requirement 
for cetacean live stranding or near-shore 
atypical milling events. These 
requirements have previously been 
included in the Notification and 
Reporting Plan only. In the event of a 
cetacean live stranding (or near-shore 
atypical milling) event within the HCTT 
Study Area or within 50 km (27 nmi) of 
the boundary of the HCTT Study Area, 
where the NMFS Marine Mammal 
Stranding Network is engaged in 
herding or other interventions to return 
animals to the water, NMFS Office of 
Protected Resources (OPR) will advise 
the Action Proponents of the need to 
implement shutdown procedures for all 
active acoustic sources or explosive 
devices within 50 km of the stranding. 
Following this initial shutdown, NMFS 
will communicate with the Action 
Proponents to determine whether 
circumstances support modification of 
the shutdown zone. The Action 
Proponents may decline to implement 
all or part of the shutdown if the holder 
of the LOA, or his/her designee, 
determines that it is necessary for 
national security. Shutdown procedures 
for live stranding or milling cetaceans 
include the following: 
€If at any time, the marine mammal(s) die or are euthanized, or if 
herding/intervention efforts are stopped, 
NMFS will immediately advise that the 
shutdown around the animals’ location 
is no longer needed; 
€Otherwise, shutdown procedures will remain in effect until NMFS 
determines and advises that all live 
animals involved have left the area 
(either of their own volition or following 
an intervention); and 
€If further observations of the marine mammals indicate the potential for re- 
stranding, additional coordination will 
be required to determine what measures 
are necessary to minimize that 
likelihood (e.g., extending the shutdown or moving operations farther away) and 
to implement those measures as 
appropriate. 
Last, this final rule includes a new 
reporting requirement that states that 
Navy personnel must confirm that 
foreign military use of sonar and 
explosives, when such militaries are 
participating in a U.S. Navy-led exercise

Proponents’ use of sonar and explosives, 
would not cause exceedance of the 
analyzed levels within each NAEMO 
modeled sonar and explosive bin used 
for estimating predicted impacts. 
The regulations include an addition 
stating that the annual HCTT training 
and testing reports must summarize 
activities and observations of the San 
Nicolas Island target and missile launch 
activities for the monitoring period. 
This final rule also includes minor, 
clarifying edits in the regulatory text. 
Last, this final rule clarifies that the 
HCTT Study Area also includes Navy 
pierside locations in Hawaii and 
Southern California, Pearl Harbor, San 
Diego Bay, and the transit corridor on 
the high seas where training and testing 
may occur. 
Description of Marine Mammals and 
Their Habitat in the Area of Specified 
Activities 
Marine mammal species and their 
associated stocks that have the potential 
to occur in the HCTT Study Area are 
presented in table 1 along with each 
stock’s ESA and MMPA status, 
abundance estimate and associated 
coefficient of variation (CV) value, N
min
, 
PBR, annual M/SI, and potential 
occurrence in the HCTT Study Area. 
The Action Proponents anticipate take 
of 40 species (79 stocks) by Level A and 
Level B harassment incidental to 
military readiness activities from the 
use of sonar and other transducers, in- 
water detonations, air guns, missile and 
target launch noise, pile driving/ 
extraction, and vessel movement in the 
HCTT Study Area. 
The HCTT proposed rule included 
additional information about the species 
in this rule, marine mammal species for 
which take is not authorized, marine 
mammal species which could occur in 
the area but are not managed by NMFS, 
marine mammal hearing, and National 
Marine Sanctuaries, all of which 
remains valid and applicable but has 
not been reprinted in this final rule. 
NMFS hereby refers to the information 
and analysis provided in the proposed 
rule (90 FR 32118, July 16, 2025) which 
continue to apply to this final rule. 
Information on the status, 
distribution, abundance, population 
trends, habitat, and ecology of marine 
mammals in the HCTT Study Area may 
be found in chapter 4 of the Action 
Proponents’ application. NMFS 
reviewed this information and found it 
to be accurate and complete. Additional 
information on the general biology and 
ecology of marine mammals is included 
in the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS. Table 1 
incorporates the best available science, 
including data from the 2023 Pacific 
and Alaska Marine Mammal Stock 
Assessment Reports (Carretta et al., 
2024; Young et al., 2024) (see https://
www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/ 
marine-mammal-protection/marine- 
mammal-stock-assessments), and 2024 draft SARs, as well as monitoring data 
from the Navy’s marine mammal 
research efforts. NMFS has also 
reviewed new scientific literature since 
publication of the proposed rule and 
determined that none of these nor any 
other new information available changes 
our determination of which species 
have the potential to be affected by the 
Action Proponents’ activities or the 
information pertinent to status, 
distribution, abundance, population 
trends, habitat, or ecology of the species 
in this final rulemaking.

Endangered Species Act (ESA) status: Endangered (E), Threatened (T)/MMPA status: Depleted (D). A dash (-) indicates that the species is not listed under the ESA or designated as depleted under the MMPA. Under the MMPA, a strategic stock is one for which the level of 
direct human-caused mortality exceeds PBR or one which is determined to be declining and likely to be listed under the ESA within the foreseeable future. Any species or stock listed under the ESA is automatically designated under the MMP A as 
depleted and as a strategic stock. 3

These values, found in NMFS' SARs, represent annual levels of 
human-caused mortality plus serious injury from all sources combined (e.g., commercial fisheries, vessel strike). Annual MISI often cannot be determined precisely and is 
in some cases presented as 
a minimum value or range. A CV associated with estimated mortality due to commercial fisheries is presented in some cases. 5 
The Pacific 2023 SAR indicates that the stock trend is increasing. However, recent (2024-2025) surveys conducted by NMFS' Southwest Fisheries Science Center indicated that the estimated total abundance of 
gray whales during the 2024-2025 southbound migration was 12,950 (Eguchi et al., 2025).

Humpback whales in the Central America I 
Southern Mexico -California-Oregon-Washington Stock make up the endangered Central America DPS, and humpback whales in the Mainland Mexico -California-Oregon-Washington Stock are part of 
the threatened Mexico DPS, along with whales from the Mexico-North Pacific Stock, which do not occur in the Study Area. 58850 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations BILLING CODE 3510–22–C 
Below, we consider additional 
information about the marine mammals 
in the area of the specified activities that 
informs our analysis, such as identifying 
known areas of important habitat or 
behaviors, or where UMEs have been 
designated. 
Critical Habitat 
Currently, the humpback whale 
(Central America and Mexico DPSs), 
killer whale (Eastern North Pacific 
Southern Resident DPS), false killer 
whale (Main Hawaiian Islands Insular 
DPS), and Hawaiian monk seal have 
ESA-designated critical habitat in the 
HCTT Study Area. 
Humpback Whale 
On April 21, 2021, NMFS designated 
critical habitat for the endangered 
Western North Pacific DPS, the 
endangered Central America DPS, and 
the threatened Mexico DPS of 
humpback whales (86 FR 21082). Areas 
proposed as critical habitat include 
specific marine areas located off the 
coasts of California, Oregon, 
Washington, and Alaska. Designated 
critical habitat for the Central America 
DPS overlaps the NOCAL Range 
Complex (Units 15, 16, and 17), as well 
as PMSR and the northern portion of the 
SOCAL Range Complex (Units 17 and 
18). These areas are essential for 
humpback whale foraging and 
migration. One of the proposed critical 
habitat areas, critical habitat Unit 19, 
would have also overlapped with the 
SOCAL range in the HSTT Study Area 
but was excluded after consideration of 
potential national security and 
economic impacts of designation. 
NMFS, in the final rule designating 
critical habitat for humpback whales, 
identified prey species, primarily 
euphausiids and small pelagic schooling 
fishes of sufficient quality, abundance, 
and accessibility within humpback 
whale feeding areas to support feeding 
and population growth, as an essential 
habitat feature. NMFS, through a critical 
habitat review team (CHRT), also 
considered inclusion of migratory 
corridors and passage features, as well 
as sound and the soundscape, as 
essential habitat features. NMFS did not 
include either in the final critical 
habitat; however, as the CHRT 
concluded that the best available 
science did not allow for identification 
of any consistently used migratory 
corridors or definition of any physical, 
essential migratory or passage 
conditions for whales transiting 
between or within habitats of the three 
DPSs. Regardless of whether critical 
habitat is designated for a particular 
area, NMFS has considered all 
applicable information regarding marine 
mammals and their habitat in the 
analysis supporting these regulations. 
Killer Whale 
NMFS designated critical habitat for 
the Southern Resident killer whale DPS 
on November 29, 2006 (71 FR 69054) in 
inland waters of Washington State, and 
on August 2, 2021, revised the 
designation by designating six 
additional coastal critical habitat areas 
along the U.S. West Coast (86 FR 
41668). The HCTT Study Area overlaps 
two of the three continuous sections off 
the California coast: the North Central 
CA Coast Area and the Monterey Bay 
Area. Based on the natural history of the 
Southern Resident killer whales and 
their habitat needs, NMFS identified 
physical or biological features essential 
to the conservation of the Southern 
Resident killer whale DPS: (1) water 
quality to support growth and 
development; (2) prey species of 
sufficient quantity, quality, and 
availability to support individual 
growth, reproduction, and development, 
as well as overall population growth; 
and (3) passage conditions to allow for 
migration, resting, and foraging. 
False Killer Whale (Main Hawaiian 
Island Insular DPS) 
Critical habitat for the ESA-listed 
Main Hawaiian Islands insular false 
killer whale DPS was finalized in July 
2018 (83 FR 35062, July 24, 2018) 
designating waters from the 45 m depth 
contour to the 3,200 m depth contour 
around the main Hawaiian Islands from 
Ni’ihau east to Hawaii. This designation 
does not include most bays, harbors, or 
coastal in-water structures. NMFS 
excluded 14 areas. The total area 
designated was approximately 45,504 
km
2
(13,267 nmi
2
) of marine habitat. 
Critical habitat for the main Hawaiian 
Islands insular DPS of false killer whale 
entirely overlaps the HRC. 
Main Hawaiian Islands insular false 
killer whales are island-associated 
whales that rely entirely on the 
productive submerged habitat of the 
main Hawaiian Islands to support all of 
their life-history stages. Island- 
associated marine habitat for Main 
Hawaiian Islands insular false killer 
whale is the only essential feature of the 
critical habitat. The following 
characteristics of this habitat support 
insular false killer whales’ ability to 
travel, forage, communicate, and move 
freely around and among the waters 
surrounding the main Hawaiian Islands: 
(1) adequate space for movement and 
use within shelf and slope habitat; (2) 
prey species of sufficient quantity, 
quality, and availability to support 
individual growth, reproduction, and 
development, as well as overall 
population growth; (3) waters free of

The Baja California Peninsula Mexico and California -Baja California Peninsula Mexico populations of 
false killer whale, pantropical spotted dolphin, and pygmy killer whales are not recognized stocks in NMFS Pacific stock assessment report (Carretta et al., 
2024), but separate density estimates were derived to support the Navy's analysis. 58851 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations pollutants of a type and amount harmful 
to Main Hawaiian Islands insular false 
killer whales; and (4) sound levels that 
would not significantly impair false 
killer whales’ use or occupancy. 
Hawaiian Monk Seal 
Critical habitat for Hawaiian monk 
seals was designated in 1986 (51 FR 
16047, April 30, 1986) and later revised 
in 1988 (53 FR 18988, May 26, 1988) 
and in 2015 (80 FR 50925, August 21, 
2015). In the Northwestern Hawaiian 
Islands Hawaiian monk seal critical 
habitat includes all beach areas, sand 
spits and islets, including all beach crest 
vegetation to its deepest extent inland as 
well as the seafloor and marine habitat 
10 m in height above the seafloor from 
the shoreline out to the 200 m depth 
contour around Kure Atoll (Ho¯laniku¯), 
Midway Atoll (Kuaihelani), Pearl and 
Hermes Reef (Manawai), Lisianski 
Island (Kapou), Laysan Island (Kamole), 
Maro Reef (Kamokuokamohoali1i), 
Gardner Pinnacles (1O¯nu¯nui), French 
Frigate Shoals (Lalo), Necker Island 
(Mokumanamana) and Nihoa Island. In 
the main Hawaiian Islands, Hawaiian 
monk seal critical habitat includes the 
seafloor and marine habitat to 10 m 
above the seafloor from the 200 m depth 
contour through the shoreline and 
extending into terrestrial habitat 5 m 
inland from the shoreline between 
identified boundary points around 
Kaula Island (includes marine habitat 
only), Ni1ihau (includes marine habitat 
from 10 m to 200 m in depth), Kaua1i, 
O1ahu, Maui Nui (including Kaho1olawe, 
La¯na1i, Maui, and Moloka1i), and Hawai1i 
Island. A portion of the critical habitat 
overlaps the HRC. 
The essential features of Hawaiian 
monk seal critical habitat are: (1) 
terrestrial areas and adjacent shallow, 
sheltered aquatic areas with 
characteristics preferred by monk seals 
for pupping and nursing; (2) marine 
areas from 0 to 200 m in depth that 
support adequate prey quality and 
quantity for juvenile and adult monk 
seal foraging; and (3) significant areas 
used by monk seals for hauling out, 
resting or molting. 
Biologically Important Areas 
Ferguson et al. (2015) identified BIAs within U.S. waters of the West Coast 
(Calambokidis et al., 2015) and in Hawaii (Baird et al., 2015), which 
represent areas and times in which 
cetaceans are known to concentrate in 
areas of known importance for activities 
related to reproduction, feeding, and 
migration, or areas where small and 
resident populations are known to 
occur. Unlike ESA critical habitat, these 
areas are not formally designated 
pursuant to any statute or law but are 
a compilation of the best available 
science intended to inform impact and 
mitigation analyses. An interactive map 
of the BIAs is available here: https://
oceannoise.noaa.gov/biologically- 
important-areas. In some cases, additional, or newer, information 
regarding known feeding, breeding, or 
migratory areas is available and has 
been used to update these BIAs (as cited 
below), and a summary of all of the 
BIAs is included below. 
The West Coast and Hawaii BIAs were 
updated in 2024 (Calambokidis et al.) 
and 2023 (Kratofil et al.), respectively 
(referred to as BIA II herein). 
Calambokidis et al. (2024) and Kratofil et al. (2023) use a new scoring system 
described here and in Harrison et al. 
(2023). Experts identified an overall 
Importance Score for each BIA that 
considers: (1) ‘‘Intensity’’—the intensity 
and characteristics underlying an area’s 
identification as a BIA; and (2) ‘‘Data 
Support’’—the quantity, quality, and 
type of information, and associated 
uncertainties, upon which the BIA 
delineation and scoring depends. 
Importance Scores range from 1 to 3, 
with a higher score representing an area 
of higher intensity and data support. 
Each BIA identified in BIA II is also 
scored for boundary uncertainty and 
spatiotemporal variability (dynamic, 
ephemeral, or static). Additionally, BIA 
II includes hierarchical BIAs for some 
species and stocks where a higher 
intensity score is appropriate for a 
smaller core area(s) (child BIA) within 
a larger BIA unit (parent BIA). 
The Hawaii Study Area overlaps BIAs 
for small and resident populations of 
the following species: spinner dolphin, 
short-finned pilot whale, rough-toothed 
dolphin, pygmy killer whale, 
pantropical spotted dolphin, melon- 
headed whale, false killer whale, dwarf 
sperm whale, goose-beaked whale, 
common bottlenose dolphin, and 
Blainville’s beaked whale. Further, the 
Hawaii Study Area overlaps updated 
BIAs for humpback whale reproduction 
(Kratofil et al., 2023). The California Study Area overlaps feeding BIAs for 
blue whale, fin whale, and humpback 
whale in SOCAL. Additionally, it 
overlaps a reproductive BIA as well as

Unusual Mortality Events 
A UME is defined under section 
410(9) of the MMPA as a stranding that 
is unexpected; involves a significant 
die-off of any marine mammal 
population; and demands immediate 
response. From 1991 to the present, 
there have been 17 formally recognized 
UMEs affecting marine mammals in 
California and Hawaii and involving 
species under NMFS’ jurisdiction; 
however, there are currently none that 
are active. 
Potential Effects of Specified Activities 
on Marine Mammals and Their Habitat 
We provided a detailed discussion of 
the potential effects of the specified 
activities on marine mammals and their 
habitat in our proposed rulemaking (90 
FR 32118, July 16, 2025). NMFS hereby 
refers to the information and analysis 
provided in the proposed rule which 
continue to apply to this final rule. In 
the Potential Effects of Specified 
Activities on Marine Mammals and 
Their Habitat section of the proposed 
rule, NMFS provided a description of 
the ways marine mammals may be 
affected by these activities in the form 
of, among other things, serious injury or 
mortality, physical trauma, sensory 
impairment (auditory injury, temporary 
threshold shift, and acoustic masking), 
physiological responses (particularly 
stress responses), behavioral 
disturbance, or habitat effects. All of 
this information remains valid and 
applicable. Therefore, we do not reprint 
the information here, but refer the 
reader to that document. 
NMFS has also reviewed new relevant 
information from the scientific literature 
since publication of the proposed rule. 
Summaries of the new key scientific 
literature reviewed since publication of 
the proposed rule are presented below. 
Cure´et al. (2025) examined the effects 
of MFAS received level and source 
distance on the behavioral responses of 
14 tagged male sperm whales off 
northern Norway. Behavioral responses 
were scored using the severity scale 
from Southall et al. (2021), with 
probability and severity of behavioral 
responses (e.g., changes in vocal and dive behaviors, avoidance, cessation of 
feeding or resting, locomotion or 
orientation changes) increasing with 
higher received levels (maximum sound 
exposure level) and closer source 
proximities. From observations, 
modeling indicates that beyond 14 km 
(7.6 nmi) no significant behavioral 
responses are predicted regardless of 
received level. 
Wensveen et al. (2025), using the same animals from Cure´et al. (2025), 
concluded that source proximity (close: 
vessels transmitting MFAS starting at 
7.4 km (4 nmi) while approaching focal 
whale vs. distant: vessels transmitting 
MFAS starting 14.8 km (8 nmi) while 
approaching focal whale) influenced 
sperm whale behavioral responses by 
resulting in decreased foraging time 
with increased received levels and 
decreased source proximity, as well as 
short-term sensitization with 
subsequent exposure sessions. 
Specifically, sperm whales were found 
to increase time in a non-foraging 
behavioral state or produced a decrease 
in buzzes (indicative of reduced prey 
capture) when foraging with MFAS 
exposure. 
Henderson et al. (2025) examined the potential behavioral effects of Navy 
Submarine Command Courses (SCC) 
involving MFAS (i.e., hull-mounted, sonobuoys, helicopter-dipping) off the 
PMRF on three satellite-tagged 
Blainville’s beaked whales (there was a 
fourth tagged individual but it did not 
remain on the range during MFAS 
exposure). Behavioral responses showed 
individual variation, but short-term 
changes in dive behavior and horizontal 
movements were detected. However, 
only temporary horizontal avoidance 
was observed, with animals remaining 
near PMRF (within 10s of kilometers) 
throughout the SCC and in two 
situations returning to PMRF after the 
SCC was completed. Received levels 
were up to 150 dB, with sources closest 
points of approach (CPAs) at 18 km (9.7 
nmi). 
Previous marine mammal TTS studies 
have followed the trend that 
susceptibility to noise-induced hearing 
loss reflects baseline hearing thresholds 
by frequency (i.e., audiogram; where frequencies with lower baseline 
thresholds (lowest point in audiogram) 
being more susceptible to threshold 
shifts from noise than frequencies with 
higher baseline thresholds [at edges of 
hearing range]). Kastelein et al. (2025a) 
examined this trend using three species 
(harbor porpoise, California sea lion, 
and harbor seal) with similar baseline 
hearing thresholds (59–61 dB) at 8 kHz. 
Despite similar baseline thresholds at 8 
kHz, TTS onset (6 dB threshold shift) 
varied among the species: 169 dB 
cumulative SEL for harbor porpoise, 176 
dB cumulative SEL for California sea 
lion, and 182 dB cumulative SEL for 
harbor seal. Thus, despite similar 
baseline thresholds at 8 kHz, 
susceptibility varies among species and 
confirms it is not appropriate to 
extrapolate data between species. 
Kastelein et al. (2025b) examined TTS in two harbor seals exposed to one-sixth 
octave band noise centered 8 kHz. In 
this study, TTS onset (6 dB threshold 
shift) occurred at approximately 181 dB 
cumulative SEL, which is 6 dB higher 
than what is predicted with the current 
Navy Phase IV criteria (i.e., current Navy Phase IV criteria is considered 
more protective). Furthermore, the equal 
energy hypothesis is supported based on 
the noise exposure scenarios (e.g., 
frequency, duration, sound pressure 
levels) used in this study. 
Mulsow et al. (2025) evaluated TTS in four bottlenose dolphins exposed to 
simulated tactical continuous active 
sonar (CAS) centered at 2.8 kHz and 28 
kHz for 1.7 minutes up to 60 minutes. 
TTS onset for exposure to the 28 kHz 
CAS ranged from 180 to 190 dB 
cumulative SEL, while for the 2.8 kHz 
CAS ranged from 198 to 202 dB 
cumulative SEL. The TTS onset for HF 
cetaceans and non-impulsive sounds is 
181 dB SEL
24h
, so this study indicates 
only a slightly lower TTS onset 
threshold than that applied in the 
analysis herein for 28 kHz. 
Additionally, the equal energy 
hypothesis is supported based on the 
noise exposure scenarios (e.g., 
frequency, duration, sound pressure 
levels) used in this study. 
Kastelein et al. (2025c) evaluated TTS in two California sea lions exposed to 
one-sixth octave band noise centered at 
40 kHz for up to 60 minutes. TTS onset 
was estimated to occur at 169 dB 
cumulative SEL, which is much lower 
than that applied in the analysis herein 
for non-impulsive sounds (i.e., 179 dB SEL
24h
). This is the first time TTS was 
examined in otariid pinnipeds for noise 
exposure at 40 kHz. Previous data 
examining 32 kHz one-sixth octave band 
noise exposure found a TTS onset of 
179 dB cumulative SEL. Thus, the 
results from the 40 kHz study were 
unexpected, and the precise explanation 
for these results remains unclear. 
Results from this study indicate that 
otariid pinnipeds may be more 
susceptible to noise-induced hearing 
loss from 40 kHz underwater noise than 
applied criteria predict. Nevertheless, 
most underwater noise sources are 
predominantly low frequency. Thus, 
there are likely only limited sources that 
produce higher frequencies (e.g., some types of scientific or tactical sonar, 
acoustic deterrent devices). 
Ruser et al. (2025) represents the first assessment of grey seal (phocid 
pinnipeds) hearing behaviorally (n=2). 
This species hearing was very similar to 
measurements from other phocids, but 
with best hearing at 4 kHz being lower 
than previously measured in a phocid

infants but was first used done on a marine 
mammal (walrus) by Kastelein et al. 1993.

MRLs are the lowest level of sound to which a 
subject is responsive during behavioral observation 
audiometry (BOA). Note: An MRL is not equivalent to an audiometric threshold obtained through 
behavioral audiometry methods (Norrix 2015). 
MRLs are instead observed responses to a stimulus 
and can be affected by the state of attention, 
context, and prior experience with a signal, as well 
as the background noise levels (Dunlop et al. 2025). pinniped. Of note, one individual’s (seal 
Hg_1) thresholds were near ambient noise levels at frequencies measured 
below 1 kHz. Seal Hg_1’s thresholds were also 6 to 13 dB lower than Hg_2 from this study. Seal Hg-2’s measured 
thresholds aligned more with those 
previously measured in other phocid 
pinnipeds (see figure 1 in Ruser et al. 
(2025) for comparisons). The authors 
caution ‘‘Since the results [from Hg_1] are unusually low, confirmation of the 
hearing thresholds would be highly 
desirable.’’ Finally, each hearing group’s 
composite audiogram is created based 
on the median to reduce the influence 
of outliers (i.e., the lowest threshold from any individual does not determine 
the composite audiogram). 
Sills et al. (2025) measured low- frequency (<100 Hz) underwater hearing 
thresholds in one California sea lion 
(otariid) and two bearded seals (phocid). 
Sills et al. (2025) tested 40 Hz and found that both species can detect this 
frequency. The data were consistent 
with data previously collected from 
bearded seals (Sills et al., 2020). The 
California sea lion data from this study 
indicated a slope change at the base of 
the audiogram that may have resulted 
from a shift in the sensory modality 
from acoustic detection to detecting 
particle velocity. 
Dunlop et al. (2025) estimates masked hearing thresholds for humpback 
whales at four frequencies between 250 
Hz and 16 kHz (i.e., 250 Hz, 1 kHz, 4 kHz, and 16 kHz) using behavioral 
observation audiometry (BOA).
1
These 
data and critical ratios were used to 
determine Minimum Response Levels 
(MRLs)
2
and serve as a surrogate for 
determining the shape of this species’ 
masked audiogram, indicating 
humpback whale hearing extends to at 
least 16 kHz. This is consistent with the 
applied LF hearing criteria. 
Having considered the new 
information, along with information 
provided in public comments on the 
proposed rule, we have determined that 
there is no new information that 
substantively affects our analysis of 
potential impacts on marine mammals 
and their habitat that appeared in the 
proposed rule, all of which remains 
applicable and valid for our assessment 
of the effects of the Action Proponents’ 
activities during the 7-year period of 
this rule. 
Estimated Take of Marine Mammals 
This section indicates the number of 
takes NMFS is authorizing, which is 
based on the amount of take NMFS 
anticipates is reasonably likely to occur. 
NMFS coordinated closely with the 
Action Proponents in the development 
of their incidental take application and 
agrees that the methods the Action 
Proponents have put forth described 
herein to estimate take (including the 
model, thresholds, and density 
estimates), and the resulting numbers 
are based on the best available science 
and appropriate for authorization. 
The 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS considered 
all military readiness activities planned 
to occur in the HCTT Study Area that 
have the potential to result in the 
MMPA defined take of marine 
mammals. The Action Proponents 
determined that the four stressors below 
could result in the incidental taking of 
marine mammals. NMFS has reviewed 
the Action Proponents’ data and 
analysis and determined that it is 
complete and accurate and agrees that 
the following stressors have the 
potential to result in takes by 
harassment of marine mammals from 
the specified activities: 
€Acoustics (sonars and other transducers, air guns, pile driving/ 
extraction); 
€Explosives (explosive shock wave and sound, assumed to encompass the 
risk due to fragmentation); 
€Land-based launch noise from missile and target launches at San 
Nicolas Island and weapons firing and 
launch noise at PMRF; and 
€Vessel strike. Acoustic and explosive sources and 
land-based launch noise are likely to 
result in incidental takes of marine 
mammals by harassment. Vessel strikes 
have the potential to result in incidental 
take from injury, serious injury, and/or 
mortality. 
For this military readiness activity, 
section 3(18)(B) of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 
1362(18)(B)) defines ‘‘harassment’’ as: 
(1) any act that injures or has the 
significant potential to injure a marine 
mammal or marine mammal stock in the 
wild (Level A harassment); or (2) any act 
that disturbs or is likely to disturb a 
marine mammal or marine mammal 
stock in the wild by causing disruption 
of natural behavioral patterns, 
including, but not limited to, migration, 
surfacing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or 
sheltering, to a point where the 
behavioral patterns are abandoned or 
significantly altered (Level B 
harassment). 
Authorized takes are primarily in the 
form of Level B harassment, as use of 
the acoustic (e.g., active sonar, pile driving, and seismic air guns) and 
explosive sources and missile launches 
is most likely to result in disruption of 
natural behavioral patterns to a point 
where they are abandoned or 
significantly altered (as defined 
specifically at the beginning of this 
section, but referred to generally as 
behavioral disturbance) for marine 
mammals, either via direct behavioral 
disturbance or TTS. There is also the 
potential for Level A harassment, in the 
form of auditory injury arising from 
exposure to sound sources utilized in 
military readiness activities. Lastly, no 
more than 7 serious injuries or 
mortalities total (over the 7-year period) 
of large whales could potentially occur 
through vessel strikes, and 40 serious 
injuries or mortalities (over the 7-year 
period) from explosive use. Although 
we analyze the impacts of these 
potential serious injuries or mortalities 
that are authorized, the required 
mitigation and monitoring measures are 
expected to minimize the likelihood 
(i.e., further lower the already low probability) that vessel strike (and the 
associated serious injury or mortality) 
would occur, as well as the severity of 
other takes (including serious injury or 
mortality from use of explosives). 
Generally speaking, for acoustic 
impacts, NMFS estimates the amount 
and type of harassment by considering: 
(1) acoustic thresholds above which 
NMFS believes the best available 
science indicates marine mammals 
would experience behavioral 
disturbance or incur some degree of 
temporary or permanent hearing 
impairment; (2) the area or volume of 
water that would be ensonified above 
these levels in a day or event; (3) the 
density or occurrence of marine 
mammals within these ensonified areas; 
and (4) the number of days of activities 
or events. 
We provided a detailed discussion of 
the acoustic thresholds, acoustic effects 
modeling and estimation, range to 
effects for stressors, and marine 
mammal density information in our 
proposed rulemaking (90 FR 32118, July 
16, 2025). NMFS hereby refers to the 
information and analysis provided in 
the proposed rule which continue to 
apply to this final rule. In the Estimated 
Take of Marine Mammals section of the 
proposed rule, we identified the subset 
of potential effects that would be 
expected to rise to the level of takes 
both annually and over the 7-year 
period covered by the rule, then

but refer the reader to the proposed rule. 
Estimated Take From Acoustic 
Stressors 
The quantitative analysis process 
used for the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS and 
the application to estimate potential 
exposures to marine mammals resulting 
from acoustic and explosive stressors is 
detailed in the Acoustic Impacts 
Technical Report. 
Regarding how avoidance of loud 
sources is considered in the take 
estimation, NAEMO does not simulate 
horizontal animat movement during an 
event. However, NAEMO approximates 
marine mammal avoidance of high 
sound levels due to exposure to sonars 
in a one-dimensional calculation that 
scales how far an animat would be from 
a sound source based on sensitivity to 
disturbance, swim speed, and avoidance 
duration. This process reduces the SEL, 
defined as the accumulation for a given 
animat, by reducing the received SPL of 
individual exposures based on a 
spherical spreading calculation from 
sources on each unique platform in an 
event. The onset of avoidance was based 
on the behavioral response functions. 
Avoidance speeds and durations were 
informed by a review of available 
exposure and baseline data. This 
method captures a more accurate 
representation of avoidance by using the 
received sound levels, distance to 
platform, and species-specific criteria to 
calculate potential avoidance for each 
animat than the approach used in Phase 
III. However, this avoidance method 
may underestimate avoidance of long- 
duration sources with lower sound 
levels because it triggers avoidance 
calculations based on the highest 
modeled SPL received level exceeding 
p(0.5) on the BRF, rather than on 
cumulative exposure. This is because 
initiation of the avoidance calculation is 
based on the highest modeled SPL 
received level over p(0.5) on the BRF. 
Please see section 4.4.2.2 of the 
Acoustic Impacts Technical Report. 
Regarding the consideration of 
mitigation effectiveness in the take 
estimation, during military readiness 
activities, there is typically at least one, 
if not numerous, support personnel 
involved in the activity (e.g., range support personnel aboard a torpedo 
retrieval boat or support aircraft). In 
addition to the Lookouts posted for the 
purpose of mitigation, these additional 
personnel observe and disseminate 
marine species sighting information 
amongst the units participating in the 
activity whenever possible as they 
conduct their primary mission 
responsibilities. However, unlike in 
previous phases of HCTT, this 
quantitative analysis does not reduce 
model-estimated impacts to account for 
activity-based mitigation. While the 
activity-based mitigation is not 
quantitatively included in the take 
estimates (which, of note, would result 
in a reduction in the number of takes), 
table A–6 of appendix A of the 
application indicates the percentage of 
the instances of take where an animal’s 
closest point of approach was within a 
mitigation zone and, therefore, AUD INJ 
could potentially be mitigated. Note that 
these percentages do not account for 
other factors, such as the sightability of 
a given species or viewing conditions. 
Unlike activity-based mitigation, in 
some cases, implementation of the 
geographic mitigation areas is reflected 
in the quantitative analysis. The extent 
to which the mitigation areas reduce 
impacts on the affected species is 
addressed in the Analysis and 
Negligible Impact Determination 
section. 
For additional information on the 
quantitative analysis process, refer to 
the Acoustic Impacts Technical Report 
and sections 6 and 11 of the application. 
As a general matter, NMFS does not 
prescribe the methods for estimating 
take for any applicant, but we review 
and ensure that applicants use the best 
available science, and methodologies 
that are logical and technically sound. 
Applicants may use different methods 
of calculating take (especially when 
using models) and still get to a result 
that is representative of the best 
available science and that allows for a 
rigorous and accurate evaluation of the 
effects on the affected populations. 
There are multiple pieces of the Navy’s 
take estimation methods (e.g., 
propagation models, animat movement 
models, and behavioral thresholds). 
NMFS evaluates the acceptability of 
these pieces as they evolve and are used 
in different rules and impact analyses. 
Some of the pieces of the Action 
Proponents’ take estimation process 
have been used in Navy incidental take 
rules since 2009 and undergone 
multiple public comment processes; all 
of them have undergone extensive 
internal Navy review, and all of them 
have undergone comprehensive review 
by NMFS, which has sometimes 
resulted in modifications to methods or 
models. 
The Navy uses rigorous review 
processes (verification, validation, and 
accreditation processes; peer and public 
review) to ensure the data and 
methodology it uses represent the best 
available science. For instance, NAEMO 
is the result of a NMFS-led Center for 
Independent Experts review of the 
components used in earlier models. The 
acoustic propagation component of 
NAEMO (titled CASS/GRAB) is 
accredited by the Oceanographic and 
Atmospheric Master Library (OAML), 
and many of the environmental 
variables used in NAEMO come from 
approved OAML databases and are 
based on in-situ data collection. The 
animal density components of NAEMO 
are base products of the NMSDD, which 
includes animal density components 
that have been validated and reviewed 
by a variety of scientists from NMFS 
Science Centers and academic 
institutions. Several components of the 
model, for example, habitat-based 
density model results for species off 
Hawaii and California have been 
published in several peer-reviewed 
journals (Becker et al., 2020; Becker et 
al., 2021; Becker et al., 2022a; Becker et al., 2022b). Additionally, NAEMO simulation components underwent 
quality assurance and quality control 
(commonly referred to as QA/QC) 
review and validation for model parts 
such as the scenario builder, acoustic 
builder, scenario simulator, etc., 
conducted by qualified statisticians and 
modelers to ensure accuracy. Other 
models and methodologies have gone 
through similar review processes. 
In summary, we believe the Action 
Proponents’ methods, including the 
method for incorporating avoidance, are 
the most appropriate methods for 
predicting AUD INJ, non-auditory 
injury, TTS, and behavioral disturbance. 
But even with the consideration of 
avoidance, given some of the more 
conservative components of the 
methodology (e.g., the thresholds do not consider auditory threshold shift 
recovery between pulses), we would 
describe the application of these 
methods as identifying the maximum 
number of instances in which marine 
mammals would be reasonably expected 
to be taken through AUD INJ, non- 
auditory injury, TTS, or behavioral 
disturbance. 
Based on the methods discussed in 
the previous sections and NAEMO, the 
Action Proponents provided their take 
estimate and request for authorization of 
takes incidental to the use of acoustic 
and explosive sources for military 
readiness activities annually (based on 
the maximum number of activities that 
could occur per 12-month period) and 
over the 7-year period covered by the 
application. The following species/

were modeled by the Navy and 
estimated to have zero takes of any type 
from any activity source: killer whale 
(Eastern North Pacific Southern 
Resident stock) and spinner dolphin 
(Midway Atoll/Kure stock and Pearl and 
Hermes stock). NMFS has reviewed the 
Action Proponents’ data, methodology, 
and analysis and determined that it is 
complete and accurate. NMFS agrees 
that the estimates for incidental takes by 
harassment from all sources requested 
for authorization are the maximum 
number of instances in which marine 
mammals are reasonably expected to be 
taken and that the takes by mortality 
requested for authorization are for the 
maximum number of instances 
mortality or serious injury could occur, 
as in the case of ship shock trials and 
vessel strikes. 
Table 3, table 4, table 5, and table 6 
summarize the maximum annual and 7- 
year total amount and type of Level A 
harassment and Level B harassment that 
NMFS concurs is reasonably expected to 
occur by species and stock for Navy 
training activities, Navy testing 
activities, Coast Guard training 
activities, and Army training activities, 
respectively.

Note: The Baja California Peninsula Mexico and California -Baja California Peninsula Mexico populations of 
false killer whale, pantropical spotted dolphin, and pygmy killer whales are not recognized stocks in NMFS Pacific stock assessment report (Carretta et al., 2024), but separate density estimates were derived to support the Navy's analysis. 58877 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations marine mammal was ‘‘taken’’ through 
exposure to both TTS and behavioral 
disturbance in the model, it was 
recorded as a TTS. Of note, a higher 
proportion of the takes by Level B 
harassment of mysticetes include the 
potential for TTS (as compared to other 
taxa and prior rules) due to a 
combination of the fact that mysticetes 
are relatively less sensitive to behavioral 
disturbance and the number of auditory 
impacts from sonar (both TTS and AUD 
INJ) have increased for some species 
since the Phase III analysis (84 FR 
70712, December 23, 2019) largely due 
to changes in how avoidance was 
modeled; for some stocks, changes in 
densities in areas that overlap activities 
have also contributed to increased or 
decreased impacts compared to those 
modeled in Phase III. 
Compared to the prior analysis, the 
Action Proponents propose to use more 
hours of hull-mounted surface ship 
sonar, and these activities are newly 
analyzed in the NOCAL range complex 
and in PMSR. Compared to the prior 
analysis, this analysis considers 
increased use of MF1 (regular duty 
cycle) and MF1C (continuous duty 
cycle) associated with Navy training 
activities and decreased use of MF1 and 
MF1C associated with Navy testing 
activities. This analysis also considers 
the training and testing usage of these 
sonars across an expanded study area. 
For the maximum analyzed year of 
training and testing activities under this 
proposed action, MF1 has increased 20 
percent and MF1C has increased 50 
percent in the expanded California 
Study Area (which now includes PMSR 
and NOCAL). In the Hawaii Study Area 
MF1 and MF1C is planned to increase 
greater than 10 percent and 60 percent 
respectively when compared to the prior 
HSTT analysis. 
Additionally, the updated high- 
frequency (HF) cetacean criteria reflect 
greater susceptibility to auditory effects 
at low and mid-frequencies than 
previously analyzed. Consequently, the 
predicted auditory effects due to sources 
under 10 kHz, including but not limited 
to MF1 hull-mounted sonar and other 
anti-submarine warfare sonars, are 
substantially higher for this auditory 
group than in prior analyses of the same 
activities. Thus, for activities with 
sonars, some modeled exposures that 
would previously have been categorized 
as significant behavioral responses may 
now instead be counted as auditory 
effects (TTS and AUD INJ). Similarly, 
the updated HF cetacean criteria reflect 
greater susceptibility to auditory effects 
at low and mid-frequencies in impulsive 
sounds. For VHF cetaceans, 
susceptibility to auditory effects has not 
changed substantially since the prior 
analysis.

Estimated Take From Target and Missile 
Launch Activities 
Table 12 provides the estimated 
effects from target and missile launch 
activities at San Nicolas Island (SNI) 
and PMRF, including the amounts of 
behavioral disturbance for each species 
and stock annually. Pinnipeds hauled 
out on the shoreline of SNI have been 
observed to behaviorally react to the 
sound of launches of targets and 
missiles from launch pads on the island 
(Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons 
Division, 2018; U.S. Department of the 
Navy, 2020b, 2022b, 2023). The estimate 
of the number of behavioral effects that 
would be expected due to in-air noise 
from launches was based on 
observations of pinnipeds over three 
monitoring seasons (2015 to 2017) 
divided by the number of launch events 
over that same time period. The Navy 
determined that the numbers presented 
in table 12 (see table 5–6 of the 
application) represent the number of 
pinnipeds expected to be hauled out at 
SNI based on surveys over the 5-year 
period from 2014 to 2019 (U.S. 
Department of the Navy, 2020a) and the 
average number of effects observed per 
launch event (U.S. Department of the 
Navy, 2020b, 2022b, 2023) (of note, the 
estimated behavioral effects presented 
in table 12 are the same as those 
authorized in the July 2022 PMSR LOA 
(87 FR 40888, July 8, 2022)). 
For California sea lions, take estimates 
at SNI were derived from three 
monitoring seasons (2015 to 2017) 
where an average of 274.44 instances of 
take of sea lions by Level B harassment 
occurred per launch event. Therefore, 
275 sea lions was multiplied by 40 
launch events, for a take estimate of 
11,000 instances of take by Level B 
harassment of California sea lions 
annually (table 12). Of note, the Navy 
has not conducted more than 25 launch 
events in a given year since 2001. For 
harbor seals, a total of 12 takes were 
derived from the 2016 and 2017 
monitoring seasons and multiplied by 
40 launch events for a total of 480 
instances of take by Level B harassment 
annually (table 12). For northern 
elephant seals, take estimates were 
derived from three monitoring seasons 
(2015 to 2017) where an average of 0.61 
instances of take of northern elephant 
seals by Level B harassment occurred 
per launch event. Therefore, 1 northern 
elephant seal was multiplied by 40 
launch events for a take estimate of 40 
instances of take by Level B harassment 
of northern elephant seals annually 
(table 12). Generally, northern elephant 
seals do not react to launch events other 
than simple alerting responses such as 
raising their heads or temporarily going 
from sleeping to being awake; however, 
to account for the rare instances where 
they have reacted, the Navy considered 
that some northern elephant seals could 
be taken during launch events. 
At PMRF from 2020 to 2023, an 
annual average of 215 monk seals have 
been counted hauled out on the beach 
(unpublished Navy data). The maximum 
number of seals observed during a 
single observation was five and the 
minimum was zero; on most 
observations no hauled out seals were 
observed. This final rule includes an 
updated estimate of behavioral effects 
on hauled out monk seals based upon a 
revised estimate of missile, rocket and 
drone launches, and artillery events 
provided by the Navy. Rather than the 
35 missile, rocket, drone launches; and 
3 artillery events estimated in the 
proposed rule, the Navy anticipates 20 
missile launches and 3 artillery events 
(23 total). Each missile launch could 
occur over up to 3 days (60 days total), 
and each artillery event could equate to 
4 days of firing (12 days total). As such, 
to estimate take of monk seals from 
missile launches and artillery events, 
NMFS multiplied 5 monk seals by 72 
days of activity for a total of 360 takes 
per year. The rocket and drone launches 
referenced in the proposed rule will 
occur from a launch area outside of the 
area where these activities would be 
anticipated to harass Hawaiian monk 
seals. As such, no take from rocket and 
drone launches is anticipated or 
authorized in this final rule. Of note, 
monk seal in-air hearing is less sensitive 
than hearing in other phocid seals 
(Ruscher et al., 2021; Ruscher et al., 2025), suggesting that monk seals may 
be less likely to respond to in-air noise. 
Neither TTS nor auditory injury is 
anticipated from missile and launch 
activities, as marine mammals are not 
anticipated to be exposed to noise from 
these activities that exceed the TTS or 
auditory injury thresholds (see the 2025 
HCTT EIS/OEIS appendix E.1, In-Air 
Acoustic Effects on Pinnipeds from 
Weapons Firing Noise).

Note: Zero (0) impacts indicate a total less than 0.5 and a dash(-) is a true zero. In some cases where the estimated take within a cell is equal to 1, 
that value has been rounded up from a value that is less than 0.5 to avoid underestimating potential impacts to a species or stock based on the 7-year rounding rules discussed in section 2.4 of 
appendix E (Explosive and Acoustic Analysis Report) of 
the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS. The Baja California Peninsula Mexico and California -Baja California Peninsula Mexico populations of 
false killer whale, pantropical spotted dolphin, and pygmy killer whales are not recognized stocks in NMFS Pacific stock assessment report (Carretta et al., 2024), but separate density estimates were derived to support the Navy's analysis. 58900 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations VerDate Sep<11>2014  19:02 Dec 16, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00092 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4725 E:\FR\FM\17DER2.SGM 17DER2

Estimated Take From Vessel Strike by 
Serious Injury or Mortality 
Vessel strikes from commercial, 
recreational, and military vessels are 
known to affect large whales and have 
resulted in serious injury and fatalities 
to cetaceans (Abramson et al., 2011; 
Berman-Kowalewski et al., 2010a; Calambokidis, 2012; Douglas et al., 
2008; Laggner, 2009; Lammers et al., 
2003; Van der Hoop et al., 2013; Van der 
Hoop et al., 2012). Records of vessel strikes of large whales date back to the 
early 17th century, and the worldwide 
number of vessel strikes of large whales 
appears to have increased steadily 
during recent decades (Laist et al., 2001; 
Ritter, 2012). 
Numerous studies of interactions 
between surface vessels and marine 
mammals have demonstrated that free- 
ranging marine mammals often, but not 
always (e.g., McKenna et al., 2015), engage in avoidance behavior when 
surface vessels move toward them. It is 
not clear whether these responses are 
caused by the physical presence of a 
surface vessel, the underwater noise 
generated by the vessel, or an 
interaction between the two (Amaral 
and Carlson, 2005; Au and Green, 2000; 
Bain et al., 2006; Bauer, 1986; Bejder et al., 1999; Bejder and Lusseau, 2008; Bejder et al., 2009; Bryant et al., 1984; Corkeron, 1995; Erbe, 2002; Fe´lix, 2001; 
Goodwin and Cotton, 2004; Greig et al., 
2020; Guilpin et al., 2020; Keen et al., 
2019; Lemon et al., 2006; Lusseau, 2003; 
Lusseau, 2006; Magalhaes et al., 2002; 
Nowacek et al., 2001; Redfern et al., 2020; Richter et al., 2003; Scheidat et 
al., 2004; Simmonds, 2005; Szesciorka et al., 2019; Watkins, 1986; Williams et 
al., 2002; Wursig et al., 1998). Several authors suggest that the noise generated 
during motion is probably an important 
factor (Blane and Jaakson, 1994; Evans 
et al., 1992; Evans et al., 1994). These 
studies suggest that the behavioral 
responses of marine mammals to surface 
vessels are similar to their behavioral 
responses to predators. Avoidance 
behavior is expected to be even stronger 
in the subset of instances during which 
the Action Proponents are conducting 
military readiness activities using active 
sonar or explosives. 
The marine mammals most vulnerable 
to vessel strikes are those that spend 
extended periods of time at the surface 
in order to restore oxygen levels within 
their tissues after deep dives (e.g., sperm whales). In addition, some baleen 
whales seem generally unresponsive to 
vessel sound, making them more 
susceptible to vessel strikes (Nowacek et 
al., 2004). These species are primarily large, slow moving whales. There are 8 
species (17 stocks) of large whales that 
are known to occur within the HCTT 
Study Area (table 1): gray whale, blue 
whale, Bryde’s whale, fin whale, 
humpback whale, minke whale, sei 
whale, and sperm whale. 
Some researchers have suggested that 
the relative risk of a vessel strike can be 
assessed as a function of animal density 
and the magnitude of vessel traffic (e.g., 
Fonnesbeck et al., 2008; Vanderlaan et al., 2008). Differences among vessel types also influence the probability of a 
vessel strike. The ability of any vessel to 
detect a marine mammal and avoid a 
collision depends on a variety of factors, 
including environmental conditions, 
vessel design, size, speed, and ability 
and number of personnel observing, as 
well as the behavior of the animal. 
Vessel speed, size, and mass are all 
important factors in determining if 
injury or death of a marine mammal is 
likely due to a vessel strike. For large 
vessels, speed and angle of approach 
can influence the severity of a strike. 
Large whales also do not have to be at 
the water’s surface to be struck. Silber 
et al. (2010) found that when a whale is 
below the surface (about one to two 
times the vessel draft), under certain 
circumstances (vessel speed and 
location of the whale relative to the 
ship’s centerline), there is likely to be a 
pronounced propeller suction effect. 
This suction effect may draw the whale 
into the hull of the ship, increasing the 
probability of propeller strikes. 
There are some key differences 
between the operation of military and 
non-military vessels which make the 
likelihood of a military vessel striking a 
whale lower than some other vessels 
(e.g., commercial merchant vessels). Key differences include: 
€Military vessels have personnel assigned to stand watch at all times, day 
and night, when moving through the 
water (i.e., when the vessel is underway). Watch personnel undertake 
extensive training and are certified to 
stand watch only after demonstrating 
competency in all necessary skills. 
While on watch, personnel employ 
visual search and reporting procedures 
in accordance with the U.S. Navy 
Lookout Training Handbook, the Coast 
Guard’s Shipboard Lookout Manual, or 
civilian equivalent. 
€The bridges of many military vessels are positioned closer to the bow, 
offering better visibility ahead of the 
vessel (compared to a commercial 
merchant vessel); 
€Military readiness activities often involve aircraft (which can serve as part 
of the Lookout team), that can more 
readily detect cetaceans in the vicinity 
of a vessel or ahead of a vessel’s present 
course, often before crew on the vessel 
would be able to detect them; 
€Military vessels are generally more maneuverable than commercial 
merchant vessels, and are therefore 
capable of changing course more 
quickly in the event cetaceans are 
spotted in the vessel’s path. Of note, 
from 2019 to August 31, 2025, Navy 
vessels maneuvered 140 times, and from 
2009 to August 31, 2025, Navy vessels 
maneuvered 374 times; 
€Military vessels operate at the slowest speed practical consistent with 
operational requirements. While 
minimum speed is intended as a fuel 
conservation measure particular to a 
certain ship class, secondary benefits 
include a better ability to detect and 
avoid objects in the water, including 
marine mammals; 
€Military ships often operate within a defined area for a period of time, in 
contrast to point-to-point commercial 
shipping over greater distances; 
€The crew size on military vessels is generally larger than merchant vessels, 
allowing for stationing more trained 
Lookouts on the bridge. At all times 
when the Action Proponents’ vessels are 
underway, trained Lookouts and bridge 
navigation teams are used to detect 
objects on the surface of the water ahead 
of the ship, including cetaceans. Some 
events may have additional personnel 
(beyond the minimum number of 
required Lookouts) who are already 
standing watch in or on the platform 
conducting the event or additional 
participating platforms and would have 
eyes on the water for all or part of an 
event. These additional personnel serve 
as members of the Lookout team; and 
€When submerged, submarines are generally slow moving (to avoid 
detection); as a result, marine mammals 
at depth with a submarine are likely 
able to avoid collision with the 
submarine. When a submarine is 
transiting on the surface, the Navy posts 
Lookouts serving the same function as 
they do on surface vessels. 
Vessel strike to marine mammals is 
not associated with any specific military 
readiness activity. Rather, vessel strike 
is a limited and sporadic, but possible, 
accidental result of military vessel 
movement within the HCTT Study Area 
or while in transit. 
There were two recorded U.S. Navy 
vessel strikes of large whales in the 
HSTT (now HCTT) Study Area in 2009. 
There were no known strikes from June 
2009 until May 2021, a period of 
approximately 12 years. Of note, 
between 2009 and 2024, the Navy 
documented 384 U.S. Navy vessel 
movements in HSTT to avoid marine

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258914 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations mammals during MTEs. Since 2021 
there have been seven strikes of large 
whales in SOCAL attributed to naval 
vessels: Five by the U.S. Navy and two 
by the Royal Australian Navy. Two of 
these strikes occurred once the 
proposed rule was made publicly 
available for inspection and open 
comment (90 FR 32118, July 16, 2025). 
The facts surrounding each vessel strike 
are summarized as follows: 
On August 10, 2025, a San Antonio- 
class amphibious transport dock ship 
(661 ft (201.5 m) long) struck an 
unknown species of whale in Pacific 
Ocean waters approximately 13 nmi (24 
km) west of San Clemente Island. The 
vessel was involved with other units in 
a training exercise in the SOCAL Range 
Complex and was traveling south at 18 
kn (33.3 km/h). Bridge watchstanders 
and lookouts on the vessel spotted a 
whale 100 yards (yd; 91.4 m) ahead of 
the vessel, and the vessel responded by 
reducing speed and turning to the right 
with a full right rudder. The aft lookout 
reported blood in the water, and the 
vessel turned around to verify the 
report. Crew observed a whale blow and 
blood in the water. The vessel remained 
in the area for another 20 minutes and 
personnel observed a whale traveling 
northeast, maintaining a minimum 
distance of 500 yd (457.2 m) from the 
whale as required by the mitigation 
measures. Crew reported two more 
blows with an 8-minute dive interval 
between each blow. The weather was 
clear at the time of the strike with a 
Beaufort sea state of 2. Although the 
species of whale was not identified at 
the time of the strike, 4 days later, on 
August 14, Navy biologists found a blue 
whale carcass washed ashore on San 
Clemente Island. While the stranding 
location and timing are close to the 
location and timing of the Navy strike, 
with a significant large whale 
population off Southern California, 
based on the available information at 
this time, we cannot confirm with any 
degree of certainty that the blue whale 
carcass found on August 14 was the 
same whale struck by the Navy vessel 
on August 10. 
On July 15, 2025, an Arleigh Burke 
class destroyer (511 ft (155.8 m) long) 
struck an unknown species of large 
whale in Pacific Ocean waters 
approximately 57 nmi (105.6 km) west/ 
southwest of San Clemente Island. The 
vessel was transiting from SOCAL to 
PMSR after conducting a training 
activity and was traveling north/ 
northwest at 22 kn (40.7 km/h) at the 
time of the strike. Personnel heard a 
thud and banging sound on the 
starboard hull. The vessel slowed and 
topside personnel discovered a whale 
lodged on the hull. The vessel came to 
a complete stop and backed up to 
dislodge the carcass which immediately 
sank, approximately 5–8 minutes after 
the strike had occurred. Navy personnel 
estimated that the whale was 
approximately 20 to 25 ft (6.1 to 7.6 m) 
long, but low light prevented 
observation of other identifying features. 
The strike occurred at night (10:12 p.m. 
local time), and visibility was poor (4– 
5 nmi (7.4–9.3 km)) with cloud cover, 
slight precipitation, and wind. No 
whales had been observed that day prior 
to the strike. 
Further, the U.S. Navy struck a large 
whale in Pacific Ocean waters off 
Southern California in May 2023. Based 
on available photos and video, NMFS 
and the Navy have determined this 
whale was either a fin whale or sei 
whale. The U.S. Navy struck two 
unidentified large whales during the 
months of June and July 2021, and prior 
to that, on May 7, 2021, the Royal 
Australian Navy HMAS Sydney, a 147.5 
m (161.3 yd) Hobart Class Destroyer, 
struck and killed two fin whales (a 
mother and her calf) while operating 
within SOCAL. Please see the 
Authorized Take From Vessel Strikes 
and Explosives by Serious Injury or 
Mortality section of the 2025 HSTT final rule (90 FR 4944, January 16, 2025) for 
detailed descriptions of the naval vessel 
strikes that occurred in 2021 and 2023. 
In March 2024 a dead fin whale was 
discovered off of Pier 10 in Naval 
Station San Diego within the Navy’s 
security barrier. The security barrier, 
which consists of a series of connected 
floating sections, is intended to 
discourage unauthorized boat entry to 
the piers. The necropsy indicated that 
vessel strike was the most likely cause 
of death. Given the location the whale 
was discovered, this could have been 
the result of a military vessel strike. 
However, the Navy reviewed its vessel 
activity during that time frame and 
available observations of those vessels 
coming and going to port, as well as at 
port, and determined it was unlikely 
that the whale was carried into port by 
a Navy vessel. Based on this and other 
information from the Navy’s 
investigation, we cannot determine 
whether this whale was struck by a 
Navy vessel during HSTT activities or 
was struck by a commercial or other 
vessel and drifted into the Navy pier 
area. 
On September 12, 2025, a U.S. Navy 
lookout reported a whale carcass 
adjacent to the port quarter of a 
transiting U.S. Navy vessel in the PMSR. 
There were no observations of whales or 
other indicators prior to the discovery, 
and sailors onboard did not feel a 
shudder or other physical indicator of 
strike. While one lookout reported blood 
in the water surrounding the carcass, 
other lookouts could not corroborate the 
sighting. Some time after the potential 
observation, a piece of machinery 
within the Navy vessel’s engine room 
spaces was abnormally vibrating. Given 
the conflicting account, we cannot 
conclusively determine that a whale 
carcass was discovered, nor can we 
determine whether the Navy vessel 
struck a whale. 
There has been one recorded Coast 
Guard vessel strike of a large whale 
(humpback) in the HCTT Study Area 
since 2009. The strike occurred in 2020 
off Maui, HI. There have been no known 
strikes within the California portion of 
the HCTT Study Area. However, there 
were two Coast Guard strikes outside of 
and inshore of the California portion of 
the HCTT Study Area, a humpback 
whale in 2023 and a gray whale in 2024. 
The vessels involved in the 2023 and 
2024 strikes were moving at slow speed 
less than 6 kn (11.1 km/hr) and no 
obvious injury to the whales were 
observed after the strikes. 
In light of the key differences between 
the operation of military and non- 
military vessels discussed above, it is 
unlikely that a military vessel would 
strike any type of marine mammal 
without detecting it. Specifically, 
Lookouts posted on or near the ship’s 
bow can visually detect a strike in the 
absence of other indications that a strike 
has occurred. The Action Proponents’ 
internal procedures and mitigation 
requirements include reporting of any 
vessel strikes of marine mammals, and 
the Action Proponents’ discipline, 
extensive training (not only for 
detecting marine mammals, but for 
detecting and reporting any potential 
navigational obstruction), and strict 
chain of command give NMFS a high 
level of confidence that all strikes are 
reported. Accordingly, NMFS is 
confident that the Navy and Coast 
Guard’s reported strikes are accurate 
and appropriate for use in the analysis. 
Neither NMFS nor the Action 
Proponents anticipate vessel strike of 
dolphins, small whales (not including 
large whale calves), porpoises, or 
pinnipeds from the specified activity. 
For as long as records have been kept, 
neither the Navy nor the Coast Guard 
have any record of any small whales or 
pinnipeds being struck by a vessel as a 
result of military readiness activities. 
Over the same time period, NMFS, the 
Navy, and the Coast Guard have only 
one record of a dolphin being struck by 
a vessel as a result of Navy or Coast 
Guard activities. The dolphin was 
accidentally struck by a Navy small boat

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258915 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations in fall 2021 in Saint Andrew’s Pass, 
Florida. Except for the single reported 
strike of a dolphin in 2021, NMFS has 
never received any reports from other 
LOA or IHA holders indicating that 
these species have been struck by 
vessels. Further, the majority of the 
Action Proponents’ activities involving 
faster-moving vessels (that could be 
considered more likely to hit a marine 
mammal) are located in offshore areas 
where smaller delphinid, porpoise, and 
pinniped densities are lower. 
In order to account for the accidental 
nature of vessel strike to large whales in 
general, and the potential risk from 
vessel movement within the HCTT 
Study Area within the 7-year period of 
this proposed authorization, the Action 
Proponents requested incidental takes 
based on probabilities derived from a 
Poisson distribution. A Poisson 
distribution is often used to describe 
random occurrences when the 
probability of an occurrence is small. 
Count data, such as cetacean sighting 
data, or in this case strike data, are often 
described as a Poisson or over-dispersed 
Poisson distribution. The Poisson 
distribution was calculated using vessel 
strike data from 2009 through August 
31, 2025 in the HCTT Study Area, 
historical at-sea days in the HCTT Study 
Area for the Navy and the Coast Guard 
(described in detail in section 6 of the 
application), and estimated potential at- 
sea days for both Action Proponents 
during the 7-year period from 2025 to 
2032 covered by the requested 
regulations. The analysis incorporates 
data beginning in 2009, as that year was 
the start of the Navy’s Marine Species 
Awareness Training and adoption of 
additional mitigation measures to 
address vessel strike, which will remain 
in place along with additional and 
modified mitigation measures during 
the 7 years of this rulemaking. The 
analysis for the period of 2025 to 2032 
is described in detail below and in 
section 6.3.2 (Probability of Vessel 
Strike of Large Whale Species) of the 
application. 
Between 2009 and August 31, 2025, 
there were a total of 36,306 Navy at-sea 
days for Navy manned vessels greater 
than 118 m (387 ft, or Littoral Combat 
Ship size and above) in the HCTT Study 
Area, an average 2,178 days at-sea per 
year. This estimate is based on 
positional tracking data records from the 
Navy’s Authoritative Maritime Services 
database for the years 2016–2023. The 
Navy used the average of the 2016–2023 
annual values as a surrogate for annual 
at-sea days for each year between 2009 
and 2015. Given variation in vessel 
traffic from year to year, the Navy 
anticipates the annual average from this 
period is a sufficient prediction of 
future at-sea days for manned surface 
ships for the period of this final rule 
(2025–2032) (i.e., 2,178 days per year). In addition, this vessel strike analysis 
considers the potential for larger sized 
unmanned surface vessels (USVs) 
(longer than 61 m (200 ft)) to strike a 
large whale, as these vessels will be 
used for military readiness activities 
during the effective period of this final 
rule. While there have been no known 
vessel strikes from USVs, this analysis 
incorporates an estimated 728 at-sea 
days for large USVs, for a predicted total 
of 2,906 annual at-sea days from large 
manned vessels and large USVs from 
2025 to 2032 (20,345 at-sea days over 
the 7-year period). 
Between 2009 and August 31, 2025, 
there were a total of 4,351 Coast Guard 
at-sea days for vessels larger than 100 m 
(328 ft) in the HCTT Study Area, an 
average of 262 days per year. To account 
for limitations in data availability 
particular to Coast Guard vessel size 
classes, future new vessel or 
repositioning home port assignments, in 
consideration of documented strikes 
from Coast Guard medium sized vessels 
<100 m (<328 ft), and out of an 
abundance of caution, in the proposed 
rule, the Coast Guard predicted that 
there could be up to 60 additional at-sea 
days per year for the 2026–2032 period, 
for a predicted total of 322 annual at-sea 
days for vessels that may strike a large 
whale from 2025 to 2032 (2,254 at-sea 
days over the 7-year period). However, 
since publication of the proposed rule, 
the Coast Guard has increased that 
estimate to 100 additional at-sea days 
per year given new policies since the 
application was submitted. Therefore, 
this final rule predicts a total of 362 
annual at-sea days for vessels that may 
strike a large whale from 2025 to 2032 
(2,534 at-sea days over the 7-year 
period) 
As described above, during the same 
2009 through August 31, 2025 period, 
there were seven Navy vessel strikes of 
large whales and one Coast Guard vessel 
strike of a large whale. 
To calculate a vessel strike rate for 
each Action Proponent for the period of 
2009 through August 31, 2025, the 
Action Proponents used the respective 
number of past vessel strikes of large 
whales and the respective number of at- 
sea days. Navy at-sea days (for vessels 
greater than 65 ft (19.8 m)) from 2009 
through August 31, 2025 was estimated 
to be 36,306 days. Dividing the seven 
known Navy strikes during that period 
by the at-sea days (i.e., 7 strikes/36,306 at-sea days) results in a strike rate of 
0.000193 strikes per at-sea day. Coast 
Guard at-sea days from 2009 through 
August 31, 2025 was estimated to be 
4,351 days. Dividing the one known 
Coast Guard strike during that period by 
the at-sea days (i.e., 1 strike/4,351 at-sea days) results in a strike rate of 0.000230 
strikes per day. 
As described above, the Action 
Proponents estimated that 20,345 Navy 
and 2,534 Coast Guard at-sea days 
would occur over the 7-year period 
associated with the requested 
authorization. Given a strike rate of 
0.000193 Navy strikes per at-sea day, 
and 0.000230 Coast Guard strikes per at- 
sea day, the predicted number of vessel 
strikes over a 7-year period would be 
3.92 strikes by the Navy and 0.58 strikes 
by the Coast Guard. 
Using this predicted number of 
strikes, the Poisson distribution 
predicted the probabilities of a specific 
number of strikes (n = 0, 1, 2, etc.) from 2025 through 2032 for each Action 
Proponent. The probability analysis 
concluded that there is a 98 percent 
chance that a Navy vessel would strike 
at least one whale over the 7-year 
period, and a 90, 75, 55, 36, 20, or 10 
percent chance that more than one, two, 
three, four, five, or six whales, 
respectively, would be struck by the 
Navy over the 7-year period. 
The probability analysis concluded 
that there is a 44 percent chance that a 
Coast Guard vessel would strike at least 
one whale over the 7-year period, and 
a 12 or 2 percent chance that more than 
one or two whales, respectively, would 
be struck by the Coast Guard over the 
7-year period. 
Based on this analysis, the Navy 
requested authorization to take seven 
large whales by serious injury or 
mortality by vessel strike incidental to 
Navy training and testing activities 
(increased from five takes requested in 
the proposed rule to seven takes based 
on the updated analysis and taking into 
consideration of the July and August 
2025 vessel strikes), and the Coast 
Guard requested authorization to take 
two large whales by serious injury or 
mortality by vessel strike incidental to 
Coast Guard training activities 
(consistent with the proposed rule). 
NMFS concurs that take by serious 
injury or mortality by vessel strike of up 
to seven large whales by the Navy and 
two large whales by the Coast Guard 
(nine large whales total) could occur 
over the 7-year regulations and, based 
on the information provided earlier in 
this section, NMFS concurs with the 
Action Proponents’ assessment and 
recognizes the potential for incidental 
take by vessel strike of large whales only 
(i.e., no dolphins, small whales (not including large whale calves), 
porpoises, or pinnipeds) from military

While the Poisson distribution allows 
the Action Proponents and NMFS to 
determine the likelihood of vessel strike 
of all large whales, it does not indicate 
the likelihood of each strike occurring to 
a particular species or stock. As 
described above, the Action Proponents 
have not always been able to identify 
the species of large whale struck during 
previous known vessel strikes. 
However, based on the information 
available, the Navy requested 
authorization for take by serious injury 
or mortality by vessel strike of seven 
whales, and NMFS and Navy 
determined the appropriate breakdown 
among large whale stocks as described 
below. The Coast Guard requested 
authorization for take by serious injury 
or mortality by vessel strike of two 
whales, and of those two, no more than 
the following numbers from these 
stocks: one blue whale (Eastern North 
Pacific stock), two fin whales (CA/OR/ 
WA stock), two gray whales (Eastern 
Pacific stock), and two humpback 
whales (one each of the Mainland 
Mexico—CA/OR/WA stock and Central 
North Pacific stock). 
After concurring that take of up to 
nine large whales could occur (seven 
takes by Navy, two by Coast Guard), and 
in consideration of the Action 
Proponents’ request, NMFS considered 
which species could be among the seven 
large whales struck. NMFS conducted 
an analysis that considered several 
factors, in addition to the overlap of 
Navy activities with stock distribution: 
(1) the relative likelihood of striking one 
stock versus another based on available 
strike data from all vessel types as 
denoted in the SARs; and (2) whether 
each Action Proponent has ever struck 
an individual from a particular species 
or stock in the HCTT Study Area, and 
if so, how many times. 
To address number (1) above, for 
SOCAL, NMFS compiled information 
from the 2023 SARs (Carretta et al., 
2024; Young et al., 2024) on detected 
annual rates of large whale M/SI from 
vessel strike (table 18). Of note, these 
data include the strike of two fin whales 
by the Royal Australian Navy in 2021, 
but do not include U.S. Navy strikes in 
2021, 2023 because the species struck is 
not known. Nor do these data include 
the 2025 U.S. Navy strikes. The M/SI in 
the 2023 SAR considers modeled takes 
(accounting for undetected vessel strike 
mortality) for some, but not most 
species and stocks (i.e., M/SI for humpback whale includes modeled 
takes from Rockwood et al. (2017)). 
Using known strike data for all species 
and stocks allows NMFS to consider 
similar metrics for this comparative 
analysis. (Note we rely on the M/SI 
estimates from the 2023 SAR in our 
negligible impact analysis.) We also 
consider modeled takes of species from 
Rockwood et al. (2017) in table 18). The annual rates of large whale serious 
injury or mortality from vessel strike 
reported in the SARs help inform the 
relative susceptibility of large whale 
species to vessel strike in HCTT Study 
Area as recorded systematically over the 
5-year period used for the SARs. We 
summed the annual rates of serious 
injury or mortality from vessel strikes as 
reported in the SARs (excluding strikes 
that the SAR indicates occurred outside 
of the Study Area (e.g., in Alaska)) and then divided each species’ annual rate 
by this sum to get the percentage of total 
annual strikes for each species/stock 
(table 18).

To inform the likelihood of a single 
Action Proponent striking a particular 
species of large whale, we multiplied 
the percent of total annual strikes for a 
given species in table 18 by the total 
percent likelihood of a single Action 
Proponent striking at least one whale 
(i.e., 98 and 44 percent for the Navy and Coast Guard, respectively, as described

NMFS inadvertently omitted Coast Guard percent likelihood of 
1, 
2, and 3 strikes in the proposed rule. d 
The strike by the Coast Guard in 2016 was in San Francisco Bay, CA, outside the boundary of 
the HCTT Study Area. 58919 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations respectively, the value estimated for the 
probability of striking a particular 
species of whale once (i.e., to calculate the probability of an event occurring 
twice, multiply the probability of the 
first event by the second). The results of 
these calculations are reflected in the 
last six columns of table 18. We note 
that these probabilities vary from year to 
year as the average annual mortality 
changes depending on the specific range 
of time considered; however, over the 
years and through updated data in the 
SARs, stocks tend to consistently 
maintain a relatively higher or relatively 
lower likelihood of being struck. 
The percent likelihoods calculated (as 
described above) are then considered in 
combination with the information 
indicating the known species that the 
Navy or Coast Guard has struck in the 
HCTT Study Area since 1991 (since they 
started tracking consistently; table 18). 
We note that for the lethal take of 
species specifically denoted in table 18, 
53 percent of those struck by the Navy 
(10 of 19 in the Pacific) remained 
unidentified (including the May 2023 
strike, which as stated above, NMFS and 
the Navy have determined was of either 
a fin whale or sei whale and the August 
2025 strike), and 20 percent of those 
struck by the Coast Guard (1 of 5 in the 
Pacific) remained unidentified. 
However, given the information on 
known stocks struck, the analysis below 
remains appropriate. We also note that 
Rockwood et al. (2017) modeled the likelihood of vessel strike of blue 
whales, fin whales, and humpback 
whales on the U.S. West Coast 
(discussed in more detail in the Serious 
Injury or Mortality section of the 
Analysis and Negligible Impact 
Determination section), and those 
numbers help inform the relative 
likelihood that the Navy or Coast Guard 
could strike those stocks. 
Accordingly, stocks that have no 
record of ever having been struck by any 
vessel are considered to have a zero 
percent likelihood of being struck by the 
Navy or Coast Guard in the 7-year 
period of the final rule. Marine mammal 
stocks that have never been struck by 
the Navy or Coast Guard, have rarely 
been struck by other vessels, and have 
a low percent likelihood based on the 
historical vessel strike calculation are 
also considered to have a zero percent 
likelihood to be struck by the Navy or 
Coast Guard during the 7-year rule. We 
note that while vessel strike records 
have not differentiated between Eastern 
North Pacific and Western North Pacific 
gray whales, given their small 
population size and the comparative 
rarity with which individuals from the 
Western North Pacific stock are detected 
off the U.S. West Coast, it is highly 
unlikely that they would be 
encountered, much less struck. This 
rules out all but eight stocks. This leaves 
the following stocks for further analysis: 
blue whale (Eastern North Pacific stock), 
fin whale (CA/OR/WA stock), gray 
whale (Eastern North Pacific stock), 
humpback whale (Mainland Mexico— 
CA/OR/WA, Central America/Southern 
Mexico—CA/OR/WA, and Hawaii 
stocks), sei whale (Eastern North Pacific 
stock), and sperm whale (Hawaii stock). 
Based on available photos and video 
of the whale struck by the U.S. Navy in 
Southern California in 2023, NMFS and 
the Navy have determined this whale 
was either a fin whale or sei whale. 
While the species of the two whales 
struck by the U.S. Navy in 2021 are 
unknown, given the following factors, 
NMFS expects these strikes may have 
been CA/OR/WA fin whales or Eastern 
North Pacific gray whales, or some 
combination of these two stocks. These 
species have the highest annual rates of 
M/SI from vessel collision in California 
(1.6, 1.8, respectively, as noted above). 
Additionally, gray whales and fin 
whales have the most recorded vessel 
strike incidents by military vessels in 
California and are the only stocks 
known to have been hit more than one 
time by naval or Coast Guard vessels in 
the California portion of the study area 
(three gray whale strikes by the U.S. 
Navy (1993, 1998), two or three fin 
whale strikes by the U.S. Navy (2009, 
potentially 2023), and two fin whale 
strikes by the Royal Australian Navy 
(2021)). Further, accounting for 
undocumented vessel strikes, Rockwood 
et al. (2021) estimated that in their study 
area off Southern California from 2012 
to 2018, on average 8.9 blue, 4.6 
humpback, and 9.7 fin whales were 
killed by civilian vessel strikes from 
June to November each year. In 
addition, they estimated that, on 
average, 5.7 humpback whales were 
killed by civilian vessel strikes from 
January to April per year (Rockwood et 
al., 2021). For fin whales in particular, model-predicted densities of large 
whales in the Southern California Bight 
from May to July 2021 (the time period 
during which the 2021 strikes of two 
unidentified whales by the U.S. Navy 
occurred) estimated fin whale 
abundance as being nearly an order of 
magnitude higher than either blue or 
humpback whale abundance during this 
time period (Becker et al., 2020b; Zickel 
et al., 2021). Ship-whale encounter 
models for the U.S. West Coast EEZ also 
indicated that vessel strike mortality 
estimates for fin whales were 
significantly higher than for blue whales 
and humpback whales (Rockwood et al., 
2017). The comparatively higher 
modeled vessel strike rates for fin 
whales result from both the larger 
population as well as the more offshore 
distribution that overlaps significantly 
with several major shipping routes for a 
much greater spatial extent (Rockwood 
et al., 2017). Based on 1,243 visual boat- 
based sightings of 2,638 fin whales from 
1991 to 2011, Calambokidis et al. (2015) 
found fin whale concentration areas 
included the San Clemente Basin where 
the 2021 Navy vessel strikes occurred. 
Tanner and Cortes Banks area and the 
shelf edge west of SNI were also 
reported as fin whale concentration 
areas. There are two different 
populations of fin whales that occur in 
the Southern California Bight: a 
seasonal population, and a population 
that occurs year-round with offshore/ 
inshore movements (Campbell et al., 
2015; Falcone et al., 2022). This would 
likely make fin whales more susceptible 
to vessel strike year-round, as compared 
to other large whale species that may 
occur seasonally within SOCAL. 
Therefore, we find that, of the seven 
total takes by serious injury or mortality 
by vessel strike of large whales 
authorized for the Navy over the course 
of the 7-year rule, up to five of those 
takes could be of the CA/OR/WA stock 
of fin whale and up to two could be of 
the Eastern North Pacific stock of gray 
whale given that the two strikes of 
unidentified large whales in 2021 could 
have been of either stock. Further, we 
expect that, of the seven total takes by 
serious injury or mortality by vessel 
strike of large whales authorized for the 
Navy, up to two of those takes could 
occur in Hawaii, and therefore be of 
individuals of the Hawaii stock of 
humpback whale. NMFS expects that, of 
the two total takes by serious injury or 
mortality by vessel strike of large whales 
authorized for the Coast Guard, one of 
those takes could be of the CA/OR/WA 
stock of fin whale, Eastern North Pacific 
stock of gray whale, or Hawaii stock of 
humpback whale (Coast Guard struck a 
humpback whale in Hawaii in 2020). 
For U.S. Navy vessel strikes in 
California, based on the information 
summarized in table 18 and the fact that 
there is the potential for up to seven 
large whales to be struck by the Navy 
over the 7-year rule, one individual 
from the Eastern North Pacific stock of 
blue whale, Mainland Mexico—CA/OR/ 
WA and Central America/Southern 
Mexico—CA/OR/WA stocks of 
humpback whale, or Eastern North 
Pacific stock of sei whale could be 
among the seven whales struck. The

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258920 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations blue whales and the percent likelihood 
of striking one based on the historic 
strike calculation above can both be 
considered moderate compared to other 
stocks, and the Navy struck a blue 
whale in 2004 (based on the historic 
strike calculation, the likelihood of 
striking two blue whales is well below 
one percent (table 18)). Therefore, we 
consider it reasonably likely that the 
Navy could strike one individual over 
the course of the 7-year final rule. The 
total strikes of Eastern North Pacific sei 
whales are low (0) compared to other 
stocks, but NMFS and the Navy think it 
is possible that the Navy may have 
struck a sei whale in SOCAL in 2023. 
Therefore, we consider it reasonably 
likely that the Navy could strike a sei 
whale over the period of the rule. The 
Navy has not struck a humpback whale 
in the California portion of the HCTT 
Study Area. However, in 2016 a U.S. 
Coast Guard vessel struck a humpback 
whale heading out of San Francisco Bay, 
and as a species, humpbacks have a 
high number of total strikes and percent 
likelihood of being struck. The 
likelihood of Central America/Southern 
Mexico—CA/OR/WA (Central America 
DPS) or Mainland Mexico—CA/OR/WA 
(Mexico DPS) humpback whales being 
struck by any vessel type is moderate to 
high relative to other stocks, and NMFS 
anticipates that the Navy could strike 
one individual humpback whale from 
the Mainland Mexico—CA/OR/WA 
stock (Mexico DPS) and/or one 
individual from the Central America/ 
Southern Mexico—CA/OR/WA (Central 
America DPS) over the 7-year duration 
of the rule. 
For Coast Guard vessel strikes in 
California, NMFS anticipates that the 
Coast Guard may potentially strike the 
same species as listed above for the 
Navy. Based on the information 
summarized in table 18 and the fact that 
there is the potential for up to two large 
whales to be struck by the Coast Guard 
over the 7-year rule, one individual 
from the Eastern North Pacific stock of 
blue whale, CA/OR/WA stock of fin 
whale, Mainland Mexico—CA/OR/WA 
and Central America/Southern 
Mexico—CA/OR/WA stocks of 
humpback whale, Eastern North Pacific 
stock of gray whale, or Eastern North 
Pacific stock of sei whale could be 
among the two whales struck. While, as 
noted above, NMFS anticipates that the 
U.S. Navy is more likely to strike a fin 
whale than some other stocks, NMFS 
does not anticipate that the same is true 
for the Coast Guard, as its vessel traffic 
is not concentrated in the area where 
previous known Navy vessel strikes of 
fin whales have occurred. Given the 
lower potential total number of vessel 
strikes by the Coast Guard, NMFS does 
not anticipate that the Coast Guard is 
likely to strike more than one of any 
given species. 
For Hawaii stocks, given that all 
known vessel strikes between 2015 and 
2021 were of humpback whales, we 
anticipate that any vessel strike of a 
large whale in Hawaii would likely be 
of the Hawaii stock of humpback whale. 
Given that this stock has the highest 
percentage of total annual strikes (33.3 
percent) and a 10.7 percent chance of 
being struck by Navy vessels twice over 
the effective period of the rule, NMFS 
is authorizing two lethal takes of Hawaii 
humpback whales for the Navy and one 
for the Coast Guard. NMFS also 
anticipates that the Navy may strike up 
to one Hawaii sperm whale given the 
2007 sperm whale strike. Given the 
already lower likelihood of striking the 
Hawaii stock of sperm whales, the 
relatively lower vessel activity in the 
Hawaii portion of the HCTT Study Area, 
and the relatively lower Coast Guard 
vessel traffic compared to Navy vessel 
traffic, NMFS neither anticipates, nor 
authorizes, a Coast Guard strike of this 
stock. 
As described above, the Navy’s 
analysis suggests and NMFS’ analysis 
concurs that the likelihood of vessel 
strikes to the stocks below is 
discountable due to the stocks’ 
relatively low occurrence in the HCTT 
Study Area, particularly in core HCTT 
training and testing subareas, and the 
fact that the stocks have not been struck 
by the Navy and are rarely, if ever, 
recorded struck by other vessels. 
Therefore, NMFS is not authorizing 
lethal take for the following stocks: Blue 
whale (Central North Pacific stock), 
Bryde’s whale (Eastern Tropical Pacific 
stock and Hawaii stock), fin whale 
(Hawaii stock), gray whale (Western 
North Pacific stock), minke whale (CA/ 
OR/WA stock and Hawaii stock), sei 
whale (Hawaii stock), and sperm whale 
(CA/OR/WA stock). 
Also of note, while information on 
past vessel strikes by the Action 
Proponents can serve as a reasonable 
indicator of future vessel strike risk, 
future conditions may differ from the 
past in ways that could influence the 
likelihood of a large whale vessel strike 
occurring. In general, the magnitude of 
vessel strike risk may be increasing over 
time as many whale populations are 
gradually recovering from centuries of 
commercial whaling (Redfern et al., 
2020). Increased vessel strike risk off 
California in recent decades has been 
associated with increases in the 
abundance of fin and humpback whale 
populations in the North Pacific 
(Redfern et al., 2020). It has also been suggested that the blue whale 
population in the Eastern North Pacific, 
inclusive of the California portion of the 
HCTT Study Area, is at carrying 
capacity and recovered to pre-whaling 
levels (Monnahan et al., 2014). In 
addition, the magnitude of risk may also 
be affected by shifts in whale 
distributions over time in response to 
environmental factors including climate 
change, marine heatwaves, and 
associated changes in prey distribution. 
Historically, military vessel strikes of 
large whales within the HCTT Study 
Area have been rare events with only 10 
such strikes occurring over the past 16 
years, 7 U.S. Navy strikes, 1 Coast Guard 
strike, and 2 Royal Australian Navy 
strikes. However, the fact that two of 
these strikes occurred within a 2-month 
period (July–August) in 2025, four of 
these strikes occurred within a 3-month 
period (May–July) in 2021, and two 
occurred within a 4-month period 
(February–May) in 2009, suggests that 
military vessel strikes in California can 
be both highly episodic and clustered. 
Particularly in consideration of the 2025 
and 2023 U.S. Navy strikes, these strikes 
could also represent an early indicator 
of an increased military vessel strike 
risk within SOCAL based on the factors 
discussed above. Results from a survey 
of whale watching vessel operators and 
crew in Southern California, combined 
with remote sensing data in the area, 
suggest that the number of large whales 
may have been greater in May through 
July of 2021 compared with previous 
years in certain high military vessel 
traffic and ‘‘core’’ use HCTT areas off 
southern California, particularly farther 
offshore as well as closer to shore off 
San Diego Bay (Zickel et al., 2021). 
In conclusion, while take by vessel 
strike across any given year is sporadic, 
based on the information and analysis 
above, including consideration of the 
2021, 2023, and 2025 strikes by the U.S. 
Navy, NMFS anticipates no more than 
nine takes of large whales by M/SI could 
occur over the 7-year period of the rule 
(no more than seven by Navy, no more 
than two by Coast Guard). Of those nine 
whales over the 7-years, no more than 
six may come from the CA/OR/WA 
stock of fin whale. No more than three 
may come from the following stocks: 
gray whale (Eastern North Pacific stock) 
and humpback whale (Hawaii stock). No 
more than two may come from the 
following stocks: blue whale (Eastern 
North Pacific stock), sei whale (Eastern 
North Pacific), and humpback whale 
(Mainland Mexico—CA/OR/WA and 
Central America/Southern Mexico—CA/ 
OR/WA stocks (Mexico and Central 
America DPSs, respectively)). No more

stock of sperm whale. Note that these 
species and stock conclusions vary 
slightly from those initially requested by 
the Navy and Coast Guard. Accordingly, 
NMFS has evaluated under the 
negligible impact standard the M/SI of 
0.14, 0.29, 0.43, or 0.86 whales annually 
from each of these species or stocks (i.e., 
one, two, three, or six takes, 
respectively, divided by 7 years to get 
the annual number), along with the 
expected incidental takes by 
harassment. 
Summary of Requested Take From 
Military Readiness Activities 
Table 19 and table 20 summarize the 
authorized take by Level B harassment, 
Level A harassment, or mortality and by 
effect type, respectively.

Mitigation Measures 
Under section 101(a)(5)(A) of the 
MMPA, NMFS must set forth the 
permissible methods of taking pursuant 
to the activity, and other means of 
effecting the least practicable adverse 
impact on the species or stocks and 
their habitat, paying particular attention 
to rookeries, mating grounds, and areas 
of similar significance, and on the 
availability of the species or stocks for 
subsistence uses (‘‘least practicable 
adverse impact’’). NMFS does not have 
a regulatory definition for least 
practicable adverse impact. The 2004 
NDAA amended the MMPA as it relates 
to military readiness activities and the 
ITA process such that a determination 
of ‘‘least practicable adverse impact’’ 
shall include consideration of personnel 
safety, practicality of implementation, 
and impact on the effectiveness of the 
military readiness activity. For 
additional discussion of NMFS’ 
interpretation of the least practicable 
adverse impact standard, see the 
Mitigation Measures section of the Gulf 
of Alaska Study Area final rule (88 FR 
604, January 4, 2023). 
The mitigation measures described in 
the following section were proposed by 
the Action Proponents in their adequate 
and complete application or are the 
result of subsequent coordination 
between NMFS and the Action 
Proponent. Pursuant to the 2004 NDAA, 
NMFS coordinated with the Action 
Proponents, and the Action Proponents 
have agreed that all of the mitigation 
measures are practicable. NMFS has 
fully reviewed the specified activities 
and the mitigation measures included in 
the application to determine if the 
mitigation measures will result in the 
least practicable adverse impact on 
marine mammals and their habitat, as 
required by the MMPA, and has 
determined the measures are 
appropriate. NMFS describes these 
below as mitigation requirements and 
has included them in the final 
regulations. 
As noted in the Changes from the 
Proposed to Final Rule section, NMFS 
has added new mitigation requirements 
and clarified a few others in this final 
rule. These changes are described in 
detail in the sections below. Besides 
these changes, the required measures 
remain the same as those described in 
the proposed rule. 
Implementation of Least Practicable 
Adverse Impact Standard 
Here, we discuss how we determine 
whether a measure or set of measures 
meets the ‘‘least practicable adverse 
impact’’ standard. Our separate analysis 
of whether the take anticipated to result 
from the Action Proponents’ activities 
meets the ‘‘negligible impact’’ standard 
appears in the Analysis and Negligible 
Impact Determination section below. 
Our evaluation of potential mitigation 
measures includes consideration of two 
primary factors: (1) the manner in 
which, and the degree to which, 
implementation of the potential 
measure(s) is expected to reduce 
adverse impacts to marine mammal 
species or stocks, their habitat, or their 
availability for subsistence uses (where 
relevant). This analysis considers such 
things as the nature of the potential 
adverse impact (e.g., likelihood, scope, and range), the likelihood that the 
measure will be effective if 
implemented, and the likelihood of 
successful implementation; and (2) the 
practicability of the measure(s) for 
applicant implementation. Practicability 
of implementation may consider such 
things as cost, impact on activities, and, 
in the case of a military readiness 
activity, specifically considers 
personnel safety, practicality of 
implementation, and impact on the 
effectiveness of the military readiness 
activity. 
While the language of the least 
practicable adverse impact standard 
calls for minimizing impacts to affected 
species or stocks, we recognize that the 
reduction of impacts to those species or 
stocks accrues through the application 
of mitigation measures that limit 
impacts to individual animals. 
Accordingly, NMFS’ analysis focuses on 
measures that are designed to avoid or 
minimize impacts on individual marine 
mammals that are more likely to 
increase the probability or severity of 
population-level effects. 
While direct evidence of impacts to 
species or stocks from a specified 
activity is rarely available, and 
additional study is still needed to 
understand how specific disturbance 
events affect the fitness of individuals of 
certain species, there have been 
improvements in understanding the 
process by which disturbance effects are 
translated to the population. With 
recent scientific advancements (both 
marine mammal energetic research and 
the development of energetic 
frameworks), the relative likelihood or 
degree of impacts on species or stocks 
may often be inferred given a detailed 
understanding of the activity, the 
environment, and the affected species or 
stocks—and the best available science 
has been used here. This same 
information is used in the development 
of mitigation measures and helps us 
understand how mitigation measures 
contribute to lessening effects (or the

Note: Zero (0) impacts indicate a total less than 0.5 
and a dash (-) is 
a true zero. In 
some cases where the estimated take within a cell is 
equal to 1, 
that value has been rounded up from a value that is 
less than 0.5 
to avoid underestimating potential impacts to a species or stock based on the 7-year rounding rules discussed in section 2.4 of 
appendix E (Explosive and Acoustic Analysis Report) of 
the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS. * The Baja California Peninsula Mexico and California -Baja California Peninsula Mexico populations of 
false killer whale, pantropical spotted dolphin, and pygmy killer whales are not recognized stocks in NMFS Pacific stock assessment report (Carretta et al., 
2024), but separate density estimates were derived to support the Navy's analysis. 58933 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations risk thereof) to species or stocks. We 
also acknowledge that there is always 
the potential that new information, or a 
new recommendation, could become 
available in the future and necessitate 
reevaluation of mitigation measures 
(which may be addressed through 
adaptive management) to see if further 
reductions of population impacts are 
possible and practicable. 
In the evaluation of specific measures, 
the details of the specified activity will 
necessarily inform each of the two 
primary factors discussed above 
(expected reduction of impacts and 
practicability) and are carefully 
considered to determine the types of 
mitigation that are appropriate under 
the least practicable adverse impact 
standard. Analysis of how a potential 
mitigation measure may reduce adverse 
impacts on a marine mammal stock or 
species, consideration of personnel 
safety, practicality of implementation, 
and consideration of the impact on 
effectiveness of military readiness 
activities are not issues that can be 
meaningfully evaluated through a yes/ 
no lens. The manner in which, and the 
degree to which, implementation of a 
measure is expected to reduce impacts, 
as well as its practicability in terms of 
these considerations, can vary widely. 
For example, a time/area restriction 
could be of very high value for 
decreasing population-level impacts 
(e.g., avoiding disturbance of feeding females in an area of established 
biological importance) or it could be of 
lower value (e.g., decreased disturbance in an area of high productivity but of 
less biological importance). Regarding 
practicability, a measure might involve 
restrictions in an area or time that 
impede the Navy’s ability to certify a 
strike group (higher impact on mission 
effectiveness), or it could mean delaying 
a small in-port training event by 30 
minutes to avoid exposure of a marine 
mammal to injurious levels of sound 
(lower impact). A responsible 
evaluation of ‘‘least practicable adverse 
impact’’ will consider the factors along 
these realistic scales. Accordingly, the 
greater the likelihood that a measure 
will contribute to reducing the 
probability or severity of adverse 
impacts to the species or stock or its 
habitat, the greater the weight that 
measure is given when considered in 
combination with practicability to 
determine the appropriateness of the 
mitigation measure, and vice versa. We 
discuss consideration of these factors in 
greater detail below. 
1. Reduction of adverse impacts to 
marine mammal species or stocks and 
their habitat. The emphasis given to a 
measure’s ability to reduce the impacts 
on a species or stock considers the 
degree, likelihood, and context of the 
anticipated reduction of impacts to 
individuals (and how many individuals) 
as well as the status of the species or 
stock. 
The ultimate impact on any 
individual from a disturbance event 
(which informs the likelihood of 
adverse species- or stock-level effects) is 
dependent on the circumstances and 
associated contextual factors, such as 
duration of exposure to stressors. 
Though any proposed mitigation needs 
to be evaluated in the context of the 
specific activity and the species or 
stocks affected, measures with the 
following types of effects have greater 
value in reducing the likelihood or 
severity of adverse species- or stock- 
level impacts: avoiding or minimizing 
injury or mortality; limiting interruption 
of known feeding, breeding, mother/ 
young, or resting behaviors; minimizing 
the abandonment of important habitat 
(temporally and spatially); minimizing 
the number of individuals subjected to 
these types of disruptions; and limiting 
degradation of habitat. Mitigating these 
types of effects is intended to reduce the 
likelihood that the activity will result in 
energetic or other types of impacts that 
are more likely to result in reduced 
reproductive success or survivorship. It 
is also important to consider the degree 
of impacts that are expected in the 
absence of mitigation in order to assess 
the added value of any potential 
measures. Finally, because the least 
practicable adverse impact standard 
gives NMFS discretion to weigh a 
variety of factors when determining 
appropriate mitigation measures and 
because the focus of the standard is on 
reducing impacts at the species or stock 
level, the least practicable adverse 
impact standard does not compel 
mitigation for every kind of take, or 
every individual taken, if that mitigation 
is unlikely to meaningfully contribute to 
the reduction of adverse impacts on the 
species or stock and its habitat, even 
when practicable for implementation by 
the applicant. 
The status of the species or stock is 
also relevant in evaluating the 
appropriateness of potential mitigation 
measures in the context of least 
practicable adverse impact. The 
following are examples of factors that 
may (either alone, or in combination) 
result in greater emphasis on the 
importance of a mitigation measure in 
reducing impacts on a species or stock: 
the stock is known to be decreasing or 
status is unknown, but believed to be 
declining; the known annual mortality 
(from any source) is approaching or 
exceeding the PBR level, as defined in 
section 3(20) of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 
1362); the affected species or stock is a 
small, resident population; or the stock 
is involved in a UME or has other 
known vulnerabilities, such as 
recovering from an oil spill. 
Habitat mitigation, particularly as it 
relates to rookeries, mating grounds, and 
areas of similar significance, is also 
relevant to achieving the standard and 
can include measures such as reducing 
impacts of the activity on known prey 
utilized in the activity area or reducing 
impacts on physical habitat. As with 
species- or stock-related mitigation, the 
emphasis given to a measure’s ability to 
reduce impacts on a species or stock’s 
habitat considers the degree, likelihood, 
and context of the anticipated reduction 
of impacts to habitat. Because habitat 
value is informed by marine mammal 
presence and use, in some cases there 
may be overlap in measures for the 
species or stock and for use of habitat. 
We consider available information 
indicating the likelihood of any measure 
to accomplish its objective. If evidence 
shows that a measure has not typically 
been effective nor successful, then 
either that measure should be modified 
or the potential value of the measure to 
reduce effects should be lowered. 
2. Practicability. Factors considered 
may include cost, impact on activities, 
and, in the case of a military readiness 
activity, will include personnel safety, 
practicality of implementation, and 
impact on the effectiveness of the 
military readiness activity (see MMPA 
section 101(a)(5)(A)(ii)). 
Assessment of Mitigation Measures for 
the HCTT Study Area 
NMFS has fully reviewed the 
specified activities and the mitigation 
measures included in the application 
and the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS to 
determine if the mitigation measures 
would result in the least practicable 
adverse impact on marine mammals and 
their habitat. NMFS worked with the 
Action Proponents in the development 
of their initially proposed measures, 
which are informed by years of 
implementation and monitoring. A 
complete discussion of the Action 
Proponents’ evaluation process used to 
develop, assess, and select mitigation 
measures, which was informed by input 
from NMFS, can be found in chapter 5 
(Mitigation) and appendix K 
(Geographic Mitigation Assessment) of 
the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS. The process 
described in chapter 5 (Mitigation) and 
appendix K (Geographic Mitigation 
Assessment) of the 2025 HCTT EIS/ 
OEIS robustly supported NMFS’ 
independent evaluation of whether the 
mitigation measures would meet the

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258934 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations least practicable adverse impact 
standard. The Action Proponents are 
required to implement the mitigation 
measures identified in this final rule for 
the full 7 years to avoid or reduce 
potential impacts from acoustic, 
explosive, and physical disturbance and 
strike stressors on marine mammals. 
As a general matter, where an 
applicant proposes measures that are 
likely to reduce impacts to marine 
mammals, the fact that they are 
included in the application indicates 
the measures are practicable, and it is 
not necessary for NMFS to conduct a 
detailed analysis of the measures the 
applicant proposed (rather, they are 
simply included). However, it is still 
necessary for NMFS to consider whether 
there are additional practicable 
measures that would meaningfully 
reduce the probability or severity of 
impacts that could affect reproductive 
success or survivorship. 
Since publication of the proposed 
rule, and in consideration of public 
comments received, additional 
mitigation requirements have been 
added that will further reduce the 
likelihood and/or severity of adverse 
impacts on marine mammal species and 
their habitat. Pursuant to the 2004 
NDAA, NMFS coordinated with the 
Action Proponents, and the Action 
Proponents have agreed the additional 
mitigation measures are practicable for 
implementation, as previously 
described in the Changes from the 
Proposed Rule to the Final Rule section. 
Below we describe the added measures 
that the Action Proponents will 
implement and explain the manner in 
which they are expected to reduce the 
likelihood or severity of adverse impacts 
on marine mammals and their habitats. 
The Action Proponents have agreed to 
mitigation measures that would reduce 
the probability and/or severity of 
impacts expected to result from acute 
exposure to acoustic sources or 
explosives, vessel strike, and impacts to 
marine mammal habitat. Specifically, 
the Action Proponents will use a 
combination of delayed starts, 
powerdowns, and shutdowns to avoid 
mortality or serious injury, minimize 
the likelihood or severity of AUD INJ or 
non-auditory injury, and reduce 
instances of TTS or more severe 
behavioral disturbance caused by 
acoustic sources or explosives. The 
Action Proponents will also implement 
multiple time/area restrictions that 
would reduce take of marine mammals 
in areas where or at times when they are 
known to engage in important 
behaviors, such as calving, where the 
disruption of those behaviors would 
have a higher probability of resulting in 
impacts on reproduction or survival of 
individuals that could lead to 
population-level impacts. 
The Action Proponents assessed the 
practicability of the proposed measures 
in the context of personnel safety, 
practicality of implementation, and 
their impacts on the Action Proponents’ 
ability to meet their Congressionally 
mandated requirements and found that 
the measures are supportable. As 
described in more detail below, NMFS 
has independently evaluated the 
measures the Action Proponents 
proposed in the manner described 
earlier in this section (i.e., in consideration of their ability to reduce 
adverse impacts on marine mammal 
species and their habitat and their 
practicability for implementation). We 
have determined that the measures 
would significantly reduce impacts on 
the affected marine mammal species 
and stocks and their habitat and, 
further, be practicable for 
implementation by the Action 
Proponents. We have determined that 
the mitigation measures ensure that the 
Action Proponents’ activities would 
have the least practicable adverse 
impact on the species or stocks and 
their habitat. 
The Action Proponents also evaluated 
numerous measures in the 2025 HCTT 
EIS/OEIS that were not included in the 
application, and NMFS independently 
reviewed and concurs with the Action 
Proponents’ analysis that their inclusion 
was not appropriate under the least 
practicable adverse impact standard 
based on our assessment. The Action 
Proponents considered these additional 
potential mitigation measures in the 
context of the potential benefits to 
marine mammals and whether they are 
practical or impractical. 
Section 5.9 (Measures Considered but 
Eliminated) of chapter 5 (Mitigation) of 
the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS, includes an 
analysis of an array of different types of 
mitigation that have been recommended 
over the years by non-governmental 
organizations or the public, through 
scoping or public comment on 
environmental compliance documents. 
These recommendations generally fall 
into three categories, discussed below: 
(1) reduction of activity; (2) activity- 
based operational measures; and (3) 
time/area limitations. 
As described in section 5.9 (Measures 
Considered but Eliminated) of the 2025 
HCTT EIS/OEIS, the Action Proponents 
considered reducing the overall amount 
of training, reducing explosive use, 
modifying sound sources, completely 
replacing live training with computer 
simulation, and including time of day 
restrictions. Many of these mitigation 
measures could potentially reduce the 
number of marine mammals taken via 
direct reduction of the activities or 
amount of sound energy put in the 
water. However, as described in chapter 
5 (Mitigation) of the 2025 HCTT EIS/ 
OEIS, the Action Proponents need to 
train in the conditions in which they 
fight—and these types of modifications 
fundamentally change the activity in a 
manner that would not support the 
purpose and need for the training (i.e., 
are entirely impracticable) and therefore 
are not considered further. NMFS finds 
the Action Proponents’ explanation of 
why adoption of these 
recommendations would unacceptably 
undermine the purpose of the training 
persuasive. After independent review, 
NMFS finds the Action Proponents’ 
judgment on the impacts of these 
potential mitigation measures to 
personnel safety, practicality of 
implementation, and the effectiveness of 
training persuasive, and for these 
reasons, NMFS finds that these 
measures do not meet the least 
practicable adverse impact standard 
because they are not practicable. 
In chapter 5 (Mitigation) of the 2025 
HCTT EIS/OEIS, the Action Proponents 
evaluated additional potential activity- 
based mitigation measures, including 
increased mitigation zones, ramp-up 
measures, additional passive acoustic 
and visual monitoring, and decreased 
vessel speeds. Some of these measures 
have the potential to incrementally 
reduce take to some degree in certain 
circumstances, though the degree to 
which this would occur is typically low 
or uncertain. However, as described in 
the Action Proponents’ analysis, the 
measures would have significant direct 
negative effects on mission effectiveness 
and are considered impracticable. 
NMFS independently reviewed the 
Action Proponents’ evaluation and 
concurs with this assessment, which 
supports NMFS’ findings that the 
impracticability of this additional 
mitigation would greatly outweigh any 
potential minor reduction in marine 
mammal impacts that might result; 
therefore, these additional mitigation 
measures are not warranted. 
Last, chapter 5 (Mitigation) of the 
2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS also describes a 
comprehensive analysis of potential 
geographic mitigation that includes 
consideration of both a biological 
assessment of how the potential time/ 
area limitation would benefit the 
species and its habitat (e.g., is a key area of biological importance or would result 
in avoidance or reduction of impacts) in 
the context of the stressors of concern in 
the specific area and an operational 
assessment of the practicability of

Of note, according to the U.S. Navy, consistent 
with customary international law, when a foreign 
military vessel participates in a U.S. Navy exercise 
within the U.S. territorial sea (i.e., 0 to 12 nmi (0 to 22.2 km) from shore), the U.S. Navy will request 
that the foreign vessel follow the U.S. Navy’s 
mitigation measures for that particular event. When 
a foreign military vessel participates in a U.S. Navy 
exercise beyond the U.S. territorial sea but within 
the U.S. EEZ, the U.S. Navy will encourage the 
foreign vessel to follow the U.S. Navy’s mitigation 
measures for that particular event (Navy, 2022a, 
2022b). In either scenario (i.e., both within and beyond the territorial sea), U.S. Navy personnel will 
provide the foreign vessels participating in the 
exercise with a description of the mitigation 
measures to follow. 
implementation (e.g., including an assessment of the specific importance of 
an area for training, considering 
proximity to training ranges and 
emergency landing fields and other 
issues). In some cases, potential benefits 
to marine mammals were non-existent, 
while in others the consequences on 
mission effectiveness were too great. 
NMFS has reviewed the Action 
Proponents’ analysis in chapter 5 
(Mitigation) and appendix A (Activity 
Descriptions) of the 2025 HCTT EIS/ 
OEIS, which consider the same factors 
that NMFS considers to satisfy the least 
practicable adverse impact standard, 
and concurs with the analysis and 
conclusions. Therefore, NMFS is not 
requiring any of the measures that the 
Action Proponents ruled out in the 2025 
HCTT EIS/OEIS. Below are the 
mitigation measures that NMFS has 
determined would ensure the least 
practicable adverse impact on all 
affected species and their habitat, 
including the specific considerations for 
military readiness activities. Table 21 
describes the information designed to 
aid Lookouts and other applicable 
personnel with their observation, 
environmental compliance, and 
reporting responsibilities. The following 
sections describe the mitigation 
measures that would be implemented in 
association with the activities analyzed 
in this document.

The mitigation 
measures are organized into two 
categories: (1) activity-based mitigation; 
and (2) geographic mitigation areas. 
In the event of a cetacean live 
stranding (or near-shore atypical 
milling) event within the HCTT Study 
Area or within 50 km (27 nmi) of the 
boundary of the HCTT Study Area, 
where the NMFS Marine Mammal 
Stranding Network is engaged in 
herding or other interventions to return 
animals to the water, NMFS OPR will 
advise the Action Proponents of the 
need to implement shutdown 
procedures for all active acoustic 
sources or explosive devices within 50 
km (27 nmi) of the stranding. Following 
this initial shutdown, NMFS will 
communicate with the Action 
Proponents to determine whether 
circumstances support modification of 
the shutdown zone. The Action 
Proponents may decline to implement 
all or part of the shutdown if the holder 
of the LOA, or his/her designee, 
determines that it is necessary for 
national security. Shutdown procedures 
for live stranding or milling cetaceans 
include the following: 
€If at any time, the marine mammal(s) die or are euthanized, or if 
herding/intervention efforts are stopped, 
NMFS will immediately advise that the 
shutdown around the animals’ location 
is no longer needed; 
€Otherwise, shutdown procedures will remain in effect until NMFS 
determines and advises that all live 
animals involved have left the area 
(either of their own volition or following 
an intervention); and 
€If further observations of the marine mammals indicate the potential for re- 
stranding, additional coordination will 
be required to determine what measures 
are necessary to minimize that 
likelihood (e.g., extending the shutdown or moving operations farther away) and 
to implement those measures as 
appropriate.

Table 21 --Environmental Awareness and Education Stressor or Activity: All training and testing activities, as applicable. Requirements: Navy personnel (including civilian personnel) involved in mitigation and training or testing activity reporting under the specified activities must complete one or more modules of the U.S. Navy Afloat Environmental Compliance Training Series, as identified in their career path training plan. Modules include: • Introduction to Afloat Environmental Compliance Training Series. The introductory module provides information on environmental laws (e.g., ESA, MMPA) and the corresponding responsibilities that are relevant to military readiness activities. The material explains why environmental compliance is important in supporting the Action Proponents' commitment to environmental stewardship. • Marine Species Awareness Training. All bridge watch personnel, Commanding Officers, Executive Officers, maritime patrol aircraft aircrews, anti-submarine warfare and mine warfare rotary-wing aircrews, Lookouts, and equivalent civilian personnel must successfully complete the Marine Species Awareness Training prior to standing watch or serving as a Lookout. The Marine Species Awareness Training provides information on sighting cues, visual observation tools and techniques, and sighting notification procedures. Navy biologists developed Marine Species Awareness Training to improve the effectiveness of visual observations for biological resources, focusing on marine mammals and sea turtles, and including floating vegetation, jellyfish aggregations, and flocks of seabirds. 
• Protective Measures Assessment Protocol. This module provides the necessary instruction for accessing mitigation requirements during the event planning phase using the Protective Measures Assessment Protocol (PMAP) software tool. • Sonar Positional Reporting System and Marine Mammal Incident Reporting. This module provides instruction on the procedures and activity reporting requirements for the Sonar Positional Reporting System and marine mammal incident reporting. 58936 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations Activity-Based Mitigation 
Activity-based mitigation is 
mitigation that the Action Proponents 
will implement whenever and wherever 
an applicable military readiness activity 
takes place within the HCTT Study 
Area. Previously referred to as 
‘‘Procedural Mitigation,’’ the primary 
objective of activity-based mitigation is 
to reduce overlap of marine mammals 
with stressors that have the potential to 
cause injury or mortality in real time. 
Activity-based mitigations are 
fundamentally consistent across stressor 
activity, although specific variations 
account for differences in platform 
configuration, event characteristics, and 
stressor types. The Action Proponents 
customize mitigation for each applicable 
activity category or stressor. Activity- 
based mitigation generally involves: (1) 
the use of one or more trained Lookouts 
to diligently observe for marine 
mammals and other specific biological 
resources (e.g., indicator species like floating vegetation, jelly aggregations, 
large schools of fish, and flocks of 
seabirds) within a mitigation zone; (2) 
requirements for Lookouts to 
immediately communicate sightings of 
marine mammals and other specific 
biological resources to the appropriate 
watch station for information 
dissemination; and (3) requirements for 
the watch station to implement 
mitigation (e.g., halt an activity) until certain recommencement conditions 
have been met. The remainder of the 
mitigation measures are activity-based 
mitigation measures (table 20 through 
table 39) organized by stressor type and 
activity category and include acoustic 
stressors (i.e., active sonar, air guns, pile driving, weapons firing noise), 
explosive stressors (i.e., bombs, gunnery, underwater demolition, mine 
counter-measure and neutralization 
activities, missiles and rockets, 
sonobuoys and research-based sub- 
surface explosives, torpedoes, ship 
shock trials, and sinking exercises), and 
physical disturbance and strike stressors 
(i.e., aerial-deployed mines and non- explosive bombs, non-explosive 
gunnery, non-explosive torpedoes 
missiles and rockets, vessel movement, 
towed in-water devices, and net 
deployment). 
The Action Proponents must 
implement the mitigation measures 
described in table 20 through table 39, 
as appropriate, in response to an 
applicable sighting within, or entering 
into, the relevant mitigation zone for 
acoustic stressors, explosives, and non- 
explosive munitions. Each table 
describes the activities that the 
requirements apply to, the required 
mitigation zones in which the Action 
Proponents must take a mitigation 
action, the required number of Lookouts 
and observation platform, the required 
mitigation actions that the Action 
Proponents must take before, during, 
and/or after an activity, and a required 
wait period prior to commencing or 
recommencing an activity after a delay, 
power down, or shutdown of an 
activity. 
The Action Proponents proposed wait 
periods because events cannot be 
delayed or ceased indefinitely for the 
purpose of mitigation due to impacts on 
safety, sustainability, and the ability to 
meet mission requirements. Wait 
periods are designed to allow animals 
the maximum amount of time practical 
to resurface (i.e., become available to be observed) before activities resume. The 
Action Proponents factored in an 
assumption that mitigation may need to 
be implemented more than once when 
developing wait period durations. Wait 
periods are 10 minutes, 15 minutes, or 
30 minutes depending on the fuel 
constraints of the platform and 
feasibility of implementation. NMFS 
concurs with these proposed wait 
periods. 
If an applicable species (identified in 
relevant mitigation table) is observed 
within a required mitigation zone prior 
to the initial start of the activity, the 
Action Proponents must: (1) relocate the 
event to a location where applicable 
species are not observed; or (2) delay the 
initial start of the event (or stressor use) 
until one of the ‘‘Mitigation Zone All- 
Clear Conditions’’ (defined below) has 
been met. If an applicable stressor is 
observed within a required mitigation 
zone during the event (i.e., during use of the indicated source) the Action 
Proponents must take the action 
described in the ‘‘Mitigation Zones’’ 
section of the table until one of the 
Mitigation Zone All-Clear Conditions 
has been met. 
For all activities, an activity may not 
commence or recommence until one of 
the following ‘‘Mitigation Zone All- 
Clear Conditions’’ have been met: (1) a 
Lookout observes the applicable species 
exiting the mitigation zone; (2) a 
Lookout concludes that the animal has 
exited the mitigation zone based on its 
observed course, speed, and movement 
relative to the mitigation zone; (3) a 
Lookout affirms the mitigation zone has 
been clear from additional sightings for 
a designated ‘‘wait period’’; or (4) for 
mobile events, the stressor has transited 
a distance equal to double the 
mitigation zone size beyond the location 
of the last sighting. 
Activity-Based Mitigation for Active 
Acoustic Stressors 
Mitigation measures for acoustic 
stressors are provided below and 
include active acoustic sources (table 
20), pile driving and extraction (table 
21), and weapons firing noise (table 22). 
For this action, the following ranges 
apply to the use of small, medium, and 
large caliber: small is up to and 
including 50 caliber machine gun 
rounds; medium is greater than 50 
caliber and less than 57 millimeter (mm; 
2.24 inch); and large is 57 mm (2.24 
inch) and larger. Small caliber items are 
solid projectiles (i.e., bullets). Medium caliber items are 30–57 mm (1.18–2.24 
inch) and can have both inert non- 
explosive rounds and high explosive 
rounds. Large caliber items are greater 
than or equal to 57 mm (2.24 inch) and 
can have both inert non-explosive 
rounds and high explosive rounds. 
Activity-based mitigation for acoustic 
stressors does not apply to: 
€Sources not operated under positive control (e.g., moored oceanographic sources); 
€Sources used for safety of navigation (e.g., fathometers); €Sources used or deployed by aircraft operating at high altitudes; 
€Sources used, deployed, or towed by unmanned platforms except when 
escort vessels are already participating 
in the event and have positive control 
over the source; 
€Sources used by submerged submarines (e.g., sonar (since they cannot conduct visual observation)); 
€De minimis sources (e.g., those >200 kHz); 
€Unattended sources, including those used for acoustic and 
oceanographic research; and 
€Vessel-based, unmanned vehicle- based, or towed in-water sources when 
marine mammals (e.g., dolphins) are determined to be intentionally 
swimming at the bow or alongside or 
directly behind the vessel, vehicle, or 
device (e.g., to bow-ride or wake-ride). BILLING CODE 3510–22–P

This measure is new to this fmal rule. Soft-start procedures are used to provide additional protection to marine mammals by providing warning and/or giving marine mammals a chance to leave the area prior to the hammer operating at full capacity (of note, Navy continues to consider soft-start procedures as part of 
their standard operating procedures, and as such, they are not listed as a mitigation measure in the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS).

be determined on site by fuel 
restrictions and mission-essential 
follow-on commitments. For example, it 
is more challenging to remain on-site for 
extended periods of time for some 
activities due to factors such as range 
from the target or altitude of an aircraft. 
For all activities involving explosives, if 
a marine mammal is visibly injured or

Activity-Based Mitigation for Non- 
Explosive Ordnance 
Mitigation measures for non-explosive 
ordnance are provided below and 
include aerial-deployed mines and non- 
explosive bombs (table 33), non- 
explosive gunnery (table 34), and non- 
explosive missiles and rockets (table 
35). Explosive aerial-deployed mines do 
not detonate upon contact with the 
water surface and are therefore 
considered non-explosive when 
mitigating the potential for a mine shape 
to strike a marine mammal at the water 
surface. Activity-based mitigation for 
non-explosive ordnance does not apply 
to non-explosive ordnance: 
€Deployed by aircraft operating at high altitudes; 
€Deployed against aerial targets and land-based targets; 
€Deployed during vessel- or shore- launched missile or rocket events; and 
€Deployed by unmanned platforms except when escort vessels are already 
participating in the event and have 
positive control over ordnance 
deployment.

Geographic Mitigation Areas 
In addition to activity-based 
mitigation, the Action Proponents will 
implement mitigation measures within 
mitigation areas to avoid or minimize 
potential impacts on marine mammals 
(see figures 11–1 and 11–2 of the 
application). A full technical analysis of 
the mitigation areas that the Action 
Proponents considered for marine 
mammals is provided in appendix K 
(Geographic Mitigation Assessment) of 
the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS. The Action 
Proponents took into account public 
comments received on the 2024 HCTT 
Draft EIS/OEIS, 2017 HSTT Draft EIS/ 
OEIS, the best available science, and the 
practicability of implementing 
additional mitigation measures and has 
enhanced its mitigation areas and 
mitigation measures beyond those that 
were included in the 2018–2025 
regulations to further reduce impacts to 
marine mammals. 
Information on the mitigation 
measures that the Action Proponents 
propose to implement within mitigation 
areas are provided in table 40 through 
table 49. The mitigation applies year- 
round unless specified otherwise in the 
tables. 
NMFS conducted an independent 
analysis of the mitigation areas that the 
Action Proponent proposed, which are 
described below. NMFS’ analysis 
indicates the measures in these 
geographic mitigation areas are both 
practicable and will reduce the 
likelihood, magnitude, or severity of 
adverse impacts to marine mammals or 
their habitat in the manner described in 
the Action Proponents’ analysis and this 
rule. NMFS is heavily reliant on the 
Action Proponents’ description of 
operational practicability, since the 
Action Proponents are best equipped to 
describe the degree to which a given 
mitigation measure affects personnel 
safety or mission effectiveness, and is 
practical to implement. The Action 
Proponents consider the required 
measures in this rule to be practicable, 
and NMFS concurs. We further discuss 
the manner in which the geographic 
mitigation areas will reduce the 
likelihood, magnitude, or severity of 
adverse impacts to marine mammal 
species or their habitat in the Analysis 
and Negligible Impact Determination 
section.

Mitigation Conclusions 
NMFS has carefully evaluated the 
Action Proponents’ proposed mitigation 
measures—many of which were 
developed with NMFS’ input during the 
previous phases of HCTT (formerly 
HSTT) authorizations but several of 
which are new since implementation of 
the 2018 to 2025 regulations—and 
considered a broad range of other 
measures (i.e., the measures considered but eliminated in the 2025 HCTT EIS/ 
OEIS, which reflect many of the 
comments that have arisen from public 
input or through discussion with NMFS 
in past years) in the context of ensuring 
that NMFS prescribes the means of 
effecting the least practicable adverse 
impact on the affected marine mammal 
species and their habitat. Our evaluation 
of potential measures included 
consideration of the following factors in 
relation to one another: (1) the manner 
in which, and the degree to which, the 
successful implementation of the 
mitigation measures is expected to 
reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude 
of adverse impacts to marine mammal 
species and their habitat; (2) the proven 
or likely efficacy of the measures; and 
(3) the practicability of the measures for 
applicant implementation, including 
consideration of personnel safety, 
practicality of implementation, and 
impact on the effectiveness of the 
military readiness activity. 
Based on our evaluation of the Action 
Proponents’ proposed measures, as well 
as other measures considered by the 
Action Proponents and NMFS (see 
section 5.9 (Measures Considered but 
Eliminated) of chapter 5 (Mitigation) of 
the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS), NMFS has 
determined that these mitigation 
measures are appropriate means of 
effecting the least practicable adverse 
impact on marine mammal species and 
their habitat, paying particular attention 
to rookeries, mating grounds, and areas 
of similar significance, and considering 
specifically personnel safety, 
practicality of implementation, and 
impact on the effectiveness of the 
military readiness activity. 
Additionally, an adaptive management 
component helps further ensure that 
mitigation is regularly assessed and 
provides a mechanism to improve the 
mitigation, based on the factors above, 
through modification as appropriate. 
Thus, NMFS concludes that the 
mitigation measures outlined in this 
final rule satisfy the statutory standard 
and that any adverse impacts that 
remain cannot be practicably further 
mitigated. 
Monitoring 
Section 101(a)(5)(A) of the MMPA 
states that in order to authorize 
incidental take for an activity, NMFS 
must set forth requirements pertaining 
to the monitoring and reporting of such 
taking. The MMPA implementing 
regulations at 50 CFR 216.104(a)(13) 
indicate that requests for ITAs must 
include the suggested means of 
accomplishing the necessary monitoring 
and reporting that will result in 
increased knowledge of the species and 
of the level of taking or impacts on 
populations of marine mammals that are 
expected to be present. 
We provided a detailed discussion of 
monitoring in our proposed rulemaking 
(90 FR 32118, July 16, 2025). In the 
Proposed Monitoring section of the 
proposed rule, NMFS provided a 
description of the Navy Marine Species 
Research and Monitoring Strategic 
Framework, and past and current Navy 
monitoring in the HCTT Study Area. All 
of this information remains valid and 
applicable and is not repeated here. 
The Navy’s marine species monitoring 
program supports several monitoring 
projects in the HCTT Study Area at any 
given time. Additional details on the 
scientific objectives for each project can 
be found at: https://
www.navymarinespeciesmonitoring.us/ 
regions/pacific/current-projects. Future monitoring efforts by the Action 
Proponents in the HCTT Study Area are 
anticipated to continue along the same 
objectives: establish the baseline habitat 
uses and movement patterns; establish 
the baseline behavior (foraging, dive 
patterns, etc.); and evaluate potential exposure and behavioral responses of 
marine mammals exposed to training 
and testing activities. 
Adaptive Management 
The regulations governing the take of 
marine mammals incidental to military 
readiness activities in the HCTT Study 
Area contain an adaptive management 
component. Our understanding of the 
effects of military readiness activities 
(e.g., acoustic and explosive stressors) on marine mammals continues to 
evolve, which makes the inclusion of an 
adaptive management component both 
valuable and necessary within the 
context of 7-year regulations. 
The reporting requirements associated 
with this final rule are designed to 
provide NMFS with monitoring data 
from the previous year to allow NMFS 
to consider whether any changes to 
existing mitigation and monitoring 
requirements are appropriate. The use of 
adaptive management allows NMFS to 
consider new information from different 
sources to determine (with input from 
the Action Proponents regarding 
practicability) on an annual or biennial 
basis if mitigation or monitoring 
measures should be modified (including 
additions or deletions). Mitigation 
measures could be modified if new data 
suggests that such modifications would 
have a reasonable likelihood of more 
effectively accomplishing the goals of 
the mitigation and monitoring and if the 
measures are practicable. If the 
modifications to the mitigation, 
monitoring, or reporting measures are 
substantial, NMFS would publish a 
notice of the planned LOAs in the 
Federal Register and solicit public 
comment. 
The following are some of the 
possible sources of applicable data to be 
considered through the adaptive 
management process: (1) results from 
monitoring and exercise reports, as 
required by MMPA authorizations; (2) 
compiled results of Navy-funded 
research and development studies; (3) 
results from specific stranding 
investigations; (4) results from general 
marine mammal and sound research; 
and (5) any information which reveals 
that marine mammals may have been 
taken in a manner, extent, or number 
not authorized by these regulations or 
subsequent LOAs. The results from 
monitoring reports and other studies 
may be viewed at: https://
www.navymarinespeciesmonitoring.us. 
Reporting 
In order to issue an ITA for an 
activity, section 101(a)(5)(A) of the 
MMPA states that NMFS must set forth 
requirements pertaining to the 
monitoring and reporting of such taking. 
Effective reporting is critical both to 
compliance as well as ensuring that the 
most value is obtained from the required 
monitoring. Reports from individual 
monitoring events, results of analyses, 
publications, and periodic progress 
reports for specific monitoring projects 
will be posted to the Navy’s Marine 
Species Monitoring web portal: https:// 
www.navymarinespeciesmonitoring.us. 
We provided a detailed discussion of 
reporting in our proposed rulemaking 
(90 FR 32118, July 16, 2025). In the 
Proposed Reporting section of the 
proposed rule, NMFS provided 
descriptions of: special reporting for 
geographic mitigation areas; the 
Notification and Reporting Plan for 
injured, live stranded, or dead marine 
mammals; annual HCTT Study Area 
marine species monitoring report; 
annual HCTT training and testing 
reports; and other reporting and 
coordination. All of this information

In addition to the reporting 
requirements included in the proposed 
rule, this final rule requires that in the 
Annual HCTT Training and Testing 
Reports Navy personnel must confirm 
that foreign military use of sonar and 
explosives, when such militaries are 
participating in a U.S. Navy-led exercise 
or event, combined with the Action 
Proponents’ use of sonar and explosives, 
would not cause exceedance of the 
analyzed levels within each NAEMO 
modeled sonar and explosive bin used 
for estimating predicted impacts. 
Further, it requires that, for the 
California Large Whale Real-Time 
Notification Mitigation Area, the 
following information will be provided 
by the Navy in the Annual HCTT 
Training and Testing Reports: Date, time 
and general location of the whales when 
the aggregation was first sighted, and 
the total number of whales in the 
aggregation. If the whales are identified 
by species, that information will be 
provided as well. 
Analysis and Negligible Impact 
Determination 
General Negligible Impact Analysis 
Introduction 
NMFS has defined negligible impact 
as an impact resulting from the 
specified activity that cannot be 
reasonably expected to, and is not 
reasonably likely to, adversely affect the 
species or stock through effects on 
annual rates of recruitment or survival 
(50 CFR 216.103). A negligible impact 
finding is based on the lack of likely 
adverse effects on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival (i.e., population- level effects). An estimate of the number 
of takes alone is not enough information 
on which to base an impact 
determination. In addition to 
considering estimates of the number of 
marine mammals that might be taken by 
Level A harassment or Level B 
harassment (as presented in table 19), 
NMFS considers other factors, such as 
the likely nature of any responses (e.g., 
intensity, duration) and the context of 
any responses (e.g., critical reproductive time or location, migration), as well as 
effects on habitat and the likely 
effectiveness of the mitigation. We also 
assess the number, intensity, and 
context of estimated takes by evaluating 
this information relative to population 
status. Consistent with the 1989 
preamble for NMFS’ implementing 
regulations (54 FR 40338, September 29, 
1989), the impacts from other past and 
ongoing anthropogenic activities are 
incorporated into this analysis via their 
impacts on the environmental baseline 
(e.g., as reflected in the regulatory status of the species, population size and 
growth rate where known, other ongoing 
sources of human-caused mortality, and 
ambient noise levels). 
In the Estimated Take of Marine 
Mammals section, we identified the 
subset of potential effects that would be 
expected to qualify as take under the 
MMPA both annually and over the 7- 
year period covered by this rule, and 
then identified the maximum number of 
takes we believe could occur (mortality) 
or are reasonably expected to occur 
(harassment) based on the methods 
described. The impact that any given 
take will have is dependent on many 
case-specific factors that need to be 
considered in the negligible impact 
analysis (e.g., the context of behavioral exposures such as duration or intensity 
of a disturbance, the health of impacted 
animals, the status of a species that 
incurs fitness-level impacts to 
individuals). For this rule we evaluated 
the likely impacts of the enumerated 
maximum number of harassment takes 
that are authorized and reasonably 
expected to occur, in the context of the 
specific circumstances surrounding 
these predicted takes. We also include 
a specific assessment of serious injury 
or mortality (M/SI) takes that could 
occur, as well as consideration of the 
traits and statuses of the affected species 
and stocks. Last, we collectively 
evaluated this information, as well as 
other more taxa-specific information 
and mitigation measure effectiveness, in 
group-specific assessments that support 
our negligible impact conclusions for 
each stock or species. Because all of the 
Action Proponents’ specified activities 
would occur within the ranges of the 
marine mammal stocks identified in the 
rule, all negligible impact analyses and 
determinations are at the stock level 
(i.e., additional species-level determinations are not needed). 
Harassment 
The specified activities reflect 
representative levels of military 
readiness activities. The Description of 
the Proposed Activity section describes 
annual activities. There may be some 
flexibility in the exact number of hours, 
items, or detonations that may vary from 
year to year, but take totals would not 
exceed the maximum annual totals and 
7-year totals indicated in table 19. We 
base our analysis and negligible impact 
determination on the maximum number 
of takes that would be reasonably 
expected to occur annually and are 
authorized, although, as stated before, 
the number of takes is only one part of 
the analysis, which includes extensive 
qualitative consideration of other 
contextual factors that influence the 
degree of impact of the takes on the 
affected individuals. To avoid 
repetition, we provide some general 
analysis immediately below that applies 
to all the species listed in table 19, given 
that some of the anticipated effects of 
the Action Proponents’ military 
readiness activities on marine mammals 
are expected to be relatively similar in 
nature. Below that, we provide 
additional information specific to 
mysticetes, odontocetes, and pinnipeds 
and, finally, break our analysis into 
species (and/or stocks), or groups of 
species (and the associated stocks) 
where relevant similarities exist, to 
provide more specific information 
related to the anticipated effects on 
individuals of a specific stock or where 
there is information about the status or 
structure of any species that would lead 
to a differing assessment of the effects 
on the species or stock. Organizing our 
analysis by grouping species or stocks 
that share common traits or that will 
respond similarly to effects of the 
Action Proponents’ activities and then 
providing species- or stock-specific 
information allows us to avoid 
duplication while assuring that we have 
analyzed the effects of the specified 
activities on each affected species or 
stock. 
The Action Proponents’ harassment 
take request is based on one model for 
pile driving, a second model for land- 
based missile and target launches, and 
a third model (NAEMO) for all other 
acoustic stressors, which NMFS 
reviewed and concurs does 
appropriately estimate the maximum 
amount of harassment that is reasonably 
likely to occur. As described in more 
detail above, NAEMO calculates: (1) 
sound energy propagation from sonar 
and other transducers, air guns, and 
explosives during military readiness 
activities; (2) the sound or impulse 
received by animat dosimeters 
representing marine mammals 
distributed in the area around the 
modeled activity; and (3) whether the 
sound or impulse energy received by a 
marine mammal exceeds the thresholds 
for effects. Assumptions in the Navy 
models intentionally err on the side of 
overestimation when there are 
unknowns. The effects of the specified 
activities are modeled as though they 
would occur regardless of proximity to 
marine mammals, meaning that no 
activity-based mitigation is considered 
(e.g., no power down or shut down). However, the modeling does 
quantitatively consider the possibility 
that marine mammals would avoid

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258958 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations continued or repeated sound exposures 
to some degree, based on a species’ 
sensitivity to behavioral disturbance. 
NMFS provided input to, independently 
reviewed, and concurred with the 
Action Proponents on this process. The 
Action Proponents’ analysis, which is 
described in detail in section 6 of the 
application, was used to quantify 
harassment takes for this rule. 
The Action Proponents and NMFS 
anticipate more severe effects from takes 
resulting from exposure to higher 
received levels (though this is in no way 
a strictly linear relationship for 
behavioral effects throughout species, 
individuals, or circumstances) and less 
severe effects from takes resulting from 
exposure to lower received levels. 
However, there is also growing evidence 
of the importance of distance in 
predicting marine mammal behavioral 
response to sound (i.e., sounds of a similar level emanating from a more 
distant source have been shown to be 
less likely to elicit a response of equal 
magnitude (DeRuiter, 2012)). The 
estimated number of takes by Level A 
harassment and Level B harassment 
does not equate to the number of 
individual animals the Action 
Proponents expect to harass (which is 
lower), but rather to the instances of 
take (i.e., exposures above the Level A harassment and Level B harassment 
threshold) that are anticipated to occur 
over the 7-year period. These instances 
may represent either brief exposures 
(seconds or minutes) or, in some cases, 
longer durations of exposure within a 
day. In some cases, an animal that 
incurs a single take by AUD INJ or TTS 
may also experience a direct behavioral 
harassment from the same exposure. 
Some individuals may experience 
multiple instances of take (meaning over 
multiple days) over the course of the 
year, which means that the number of 
individuals taken is smaller than the 
total estimated takes. Generally 
speaking, the higher the number of takes 
as compared to the population 
abundance, the more repeated takes of 
individuals are likely, and the higher 
the actual percentage of individuals in 
the population that are likely taken at 
least once in a year. We look at this 
comparative metric (number of takes to 
population abundance) to give us a 
relative sense of where a larger portion 
of a species is being taken by the 
specified activities, where there is a 
likelihood that the same individuals are 
being taken across multiple days, and 
whether the number of days might be 
higher or more likely sequential. Where 
the number of instances of take is less 
than 100 percent of the abundance, and 
there is no information to specifically 
suggest that some subset of animals is 
known to congregate in an area in which 
activities are regularly occurring (e.g., a small resident population, takes 
occurring in a known important area 
such as a BIA, or a large portion of the 
takes occurring in a certain region and 
season), the overall likelihood and 
number of repeated takes is generally 
considered low, as it could, on one 
extreme, mean that every take 
represents a separate individual in the 
population being taken on one day (a 
minimal impact to an individual) or, 
more likely, that some smaller number 
of individuals are taken on one day 
annually and some are taken on a few, 
not likely sequential, days annually, and 
of course some are not taken at all. 
In the ocean, the use of sonar and 
other active acoustic sources is often 
transient and is unlikely to repeatedly 
expose the same individual animals 
within a short period, for example 
within one specific exercise. However, 
for some individuals of some species, 
repeated exposures across different 
activities could occur over the year, 
especially where events occur in 
generally the same area with more 
resident species. In short, for some 
species, we expect that the total 
anticipated takes represent exposures of 
a smaller number of individuals of 
which some would be exposed multiple 
times, but, based on the nature of the 
specified activities and the movement 
patterns of marine mammals, it is 
unlikely that individuals from most 
stocks would be taken over more than 
a few days within a given year. This 
means that even where repeated takes of 
individuals are likely to occur, they are 
more likely to result from non- 
sequential exposures from different 
activities, and, even if sequential, 
individual animals are not predicted to 
be taken for more than several days in 
a row, at most. As described elsewhere, 
the nature of the majority of the 
exposures would be expected to be of a 
less severe nature, and based on the 
numbers, it is likely that any individual 
exposed multiple times is still taken on 
only a small percentage of the days of 
the year. It is more likely that not every 
individual is taken, or perhaps a smaller 
subset is taken with a slightly higher 
average and larger variability of highs 
and lows, but still with no reason to 
think that, for most species or stocks, 
any individuals would be taken a 
significant portion of the days of the 
year. 
Behavioral Response 
The estimates calculated using the 
BRF do not differentiate between the 
different types of behavioral responses 
that qualify as Level B harassment. As 
described in the application, the Action 
Proponents identified (with NMFS’ 
input) that moderate behavioral 
responses, as characterized in Southall 
et al. (2021), would be considered a 
take. The behavioral responses 
predicted by the BRFs are assumed to be 
moderate severity exposures (e.g., 
altered migration paths or dive profiles, 
interrupted nursing, breeding or 
feeding, or avoidance) that may last for 
the duration of an exposure. The Action 
Proponents then compiled the available 
data indicating at what received levels 
and distances those responses have 
occurred and used the indicated 
literature to build biphasic behavioral 
response curves and cut-off conditions 
that are used to predict how many 
instances of Level B behavioral 
harassment occur in a day (see the 
Criteria and Thresholds Technical 
Report). Take estimates alone do not 
provide information regarding the 
potential fitness or other biological 
consequences of the responses on the 
affected individuals. We, therefore, 
consider the available activity-specific, 
environmental, and species-specific 
information to determine the likely 
nature of the modeled behavioral 
responses and the potential fitness 
consequences for affected individuals. 
Use of sonar and other transducers 
would typically be transient and 
temporary. The majority of acoustic 
effects to individual animals from sonar 
and other active sound sources during 
military readiness activities will be 
primarily from anti-submarine warfare 
events. It is important to note although 
anti-submarine warfare is one of the 
warfare areas of focus during MTEs, 
there are significant periods when active 
anti-submarine warfare sonars are not in 
use. Nevertheless, behavioral responses 
are assumed more likely to be 
significant during MTEs than during 
other anti-submarine warfare activities 
due to the duration (i.e., multiple days), scale (i.e., multiple sonar platforms), and use of high-power hull-mounted 
sonar in the MTEs. In other words, in 
the range of potential behavioral effects 
that might be expected as part of a 
response that qualifies as an instance of 
Level B behavioral harassment (which 
by nature of the way it is modeled/ 
counted, occurs within 1 day), the less 
severe end might include exposure to 
comparatively lower levels of a sound, 
at a detectably greater distance from the 
animal, for a few or several minutes, 
and that could result in a behavioral 
response such as avoiding an area that 
an animal would otherwise have chosen

amount of time or breaking off one or a 
few feeding bouts. More severe effects 
could occur when the animal gets close 
enough to the source to receive a 
comparatively higher level, is exposed 
continuously to one source for a longer 
time, or is exposed intermittently to 
different sources throughout a day. Such 
effects might result in an animal having 
a more severe flight response and 
leaving a larger area for a day or more 
or potentially losing feeding 
opportunities for a day. However, such 
severe behavioral effects are expected to 
occur infrequently. 
To help assess this, for sonar (LFAS/ 
MFAS/high-frequency active sonar 
(HFAS)) used in the HCTT Study Area, 
the Action Proponents provided 
information estimating the instances of 
take by Level B harassment by 
behavioral disturbance under each BRF 
that would occur within 6-dB 
increments (discussed below in the 
Group and Species-Specific Analyses 
section), and by distance in 5-km bins 
in section 2.3.3 of appendix A of the 
application. As mentioned above, all 
else being equal, an animal’s exposure 
to a higher received level is more likely 
to result in a behavioral response that is 
more likely to lead to adverse effects, 
which could more likely accumulate to 
impacts on reproductive success or 
survivorship of the animal, but other 
contextual factors (e.g., distance, duration of exposure, and behavioral 
state of the animals) are also important 
(Di Clemente et al., 2018; Ellison et al., 
2012; Moore and Barlow, 2013; Southall 
et al., 2019; Wensveen et al., 2017, etc.). The majority of takes by Level B 
harassment are expected to be in the 
form of comparatively milder responses 
(i.e., lower-level exposures that still qualify as take under the MMPA, but 
would likely be less severe along the 
continuum of responses that qualify as 
take) of a generally shorter duration. We 
anticipate more severe effects from takes 
when animals are exposed to higher 
received levels of sound or at closer 
proximity to the source. Because species 
belonging to taxa that share common 
characteristics are likely to respond and 
be affected in similar ways, these 
discussions are presented within each 
species group below in the Group and 
Species-Specific Analyses section. As 
discussed in the Behavioral Responses 
section of the proposed rulemaking (90 
FR 32118, July 16, 2025), behavioral 
response is likely highly variable 
between species, individuals within a 
species, and context of the exposure. 
Specifically, given a range of behavioral 
responses that may be classified as 
Level B harassment, to the degree that 
higher received levels of sound are 
expected to result in more severe 
behavioral responses, only a smaller 
percentage of the anticipated Level B 
harassment from the specified activities 
might result in more severe responses 
(see the Group and Species-Specific 
Analyses section below for more detailed information). 
Physiological Stress Response 
Some of the lower level physiological 
stress responses (e.g., orientation or startle response, change in respiration, 
change in heart rate) discussed in the 
Potential Effects of Underwater Sound 
on Marine Mammals section of the 
proposed rulemaking (90 FR 32118, July 
16, 2025), would likely co-occur with 
the predicted harassments, although 
these responses are more difficult to 
detect and fewer data exist relating 
these responses to specific received 
levels of sound. Takes by Level B 
harassment, then, may have a stress- 
related physiological component as 
well; however, we would not expect the 
Action Proponents’ generally short- 
term, intermittent, and (typically in the 
case of sonar) transitory activities to 
create conditions of long-term 
continuous noise leading to long-term 
physiological stress responses in marine 
mammals that could affect reproduction 
or survival. 
Diel Cycle 
Many animals perform vital functions, 
such as feeding, resting, traveling, and 
socializing on a diel cycle (i.e., 24-hour cycle). Behavioral responses to noise 
exposure, when taking place in a 
biologically important context, such as 
disruption of critical life functions, 
displacement, or avoidance of important 
habitat, are more likely to be significant 
if they last more than one diel cycle or 
recur on subsequent days (Southall et 
al., 2007). Henderson et al. (2016) found that ongoing smaller scale events had 
little to no impact on foraging dives for 
Blainville’s beaked whale, while multi- 
day training events may decrease 
foraging behavior for Blainville’s beaked 
whale (Manzano-Roth et al., 2016). 
Consequently, a behavioral response 
lasting less than 1 day and not recurring 
on subsequent days is not considered 
severe unless it could directly affect 
reproduction or survival (Southall et al., 
2007). Note that there is a difference 
between multiple-day substantive 
behavioral responses and multiple-day 
anthropogenic activities. For example, 
just because an at-sea exercise lasts for 
multiple days does not necessarily mean 
that individual animals are either 
exposed to those exercises for multiple 
days or, further, exposed in a manner 
resulting in a sustained multiple day 
substantive behavioral response. Large 
multi-day Navy exercises, such as anti- 
submarine warfare activities, typically 
include vessels moving faster than 
while in transit (typically 10–15 kn 
(18.5–27.8 km/hr) or higher) and 
generally cover large areas that are 
relatively far from HFASshore (typically 
more than 3 nmi (5.6 km) from shore) 
and in waters greater than 600 ft (182.9 
m) deep. Marine mammals are moving 
as well, which would make it unlikely 
that the same animal could remain in 
the immediate vicinity of the ship for 
the entire duration of the exercise. 
Further, the Action Proponents do not 
necessarily operate active sonar the 
entire time during an exercise. While it 
is certainly possible that these sorts of 
exercises could overlap with individual 
marine mammals multiple days in a row 
at levels above those anticipated to 
result in a take, because of the factors 
mentioned above, it is considered 
unlikely for the majority of takes. 
However, it is also worth noting that the 
Action Proponents conduct many 
different types of noise-producing 
activities over the course of the year and 
it is likely that some marine mammals 
will be exposed to more than one 
activity and taken on multiple days, 
even if they are not sequential. 
Durations of Navy activities utilizing 
tactical sonar sources and explosives 
vary and are fully described in chapter 
2 of the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS. Sonar 
used during anti-submarine warfare 
would impart the greatest amount of 
acoustic energy of any category of sonar 
and other transducers analyzed in the 
application and include hull-mounted, 
towed, line array, sonobuoy, helicopter 
dipping, and torpedo sonars. Most anti- 
submarine warfare sonars are MFAS (1– 
10 kHz); however, some sources may 
use higher or lower frequencies. Anti- 
submarine warfare training and testing 
activities using hull-mounted sonar 
proposed for the HCTT Study Area 
generally last for only a few hours. 
However, anti-submarine warfare testing 
activities range from several hours, to a 
single or more than 1 day but less than 
10 days, to more than 10 days for large 
integrated anti-submarine warfare MTEs 
(see table 2, table 3, and table 7 of the 
proposed rule; 90 FR 32118, July 16, 
2025). For these multi-day exercises 
there will typically be extended 
intervals of non-activity in between 
active sonar periods. Because of the 
need to train in a large variety of 
situations, the Navy conducts anti- 
submarine warfare activities in varying 
locations. Given the average length and

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258960 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations dynamic nature of anti-submarine 
warfare activities (times of sonar use) 
and typical vessel speed, combined with 
the fact that the majority of the 
cetaceans would not likely remain in 
proximity to the sound source, it is 
unlikely that an animal would be 
exposed to LFAS/MFAS/HFAS at levels 
or durations likely to result in a 
substantive response that would then be 
carried on for more than 1 day or on 
successive days. 
Most planned explosive events are 
instantaneous or scheduled to occur 
over a short duration (less than 2 hours) 
and the explosive component of these 
activities lasts only for minutes. 
Although explosive activities may 
sometimes be conducted in the same 
general areas repeatedly, because of 
their short duration and the fact that 
they are in the open ocean and animals 
can easily move away, it is similarly 
unlikely that animals would be exposed 
for long, continuous amounts of time, or 
demonstrate sustained behavioral 
responses. Although SINKEXs may last 
for up to 48 hours (4–8 hours typically, 
possibly 1–2 days), they are almost 
always completed in a single day and 
only a maximum of one event is 
planned annually for SOCAL and 2–3 
annually in Hawaii (see table 3 of the 
proposed rule; 90 FR 32118, July 16, 
2025). They are stationary and 
conducted in deep, open water (where 
fewer marine mammals would typically 
be expected to be randomly 
encountered), and they have rigorous 
monitoring (see table 34) and shutdown 
procedures all of which make it unlikely 
that individuals would be exposed to 
the exercise for extended periods or on 
consecutive days, though some 
individuals may be exposed on multiple 
days. 
Assessing the Number of Individuals 
Taken and the Likelihood of Repeated 
Takes 
As described previously, Navy 
modeling uses the best available science 
to predict the instances of exposure 
above certain acoustic thresholds, 
which are equated, as appropriate, to 
harassment takes. As further noted, for 
active acoustics it is more challenging to 
parse out the number of individuals 
taken by Level B harassment and the 
number of times those individuals are 
taken from this larger number of 
instances, though factors such as 
movement ecology (e.g., is the species resident and more likely to remain in 
closer proximity to ongoing activities, 
versus nomadic or migratory; Keen et 
al., 2021) or whether there are known BIAs where animals are known to 
congregate can help inform this. One 
method that NMFS uses to help better 
understand the overall scope of the 
impacts is to compare these total 
instances of take against the abundance 
of that species (or stock if applicable). 
For example, if there are 100 harassment 
takes in a population of 100, one can 
assume either that every individual was 
exposed above acoustic thresholds once 
per year, or that some smaller number 
were exposed a few times per year, and 
a few were not exposed at all. Where the 
instances of take exceed 100 percent of 
the population, multiple takes of some 
individuals are predicted and expected 
to occur within a year. Generally 
speaking, the higher the number of takes 
as compared to the population 
abundance, the more multiple takes of 
individuals are likely, and the higher 
the actual percentage of individuals in 
the population that are likely taken at 
least once in a year. We look at this 
comparative metric to give us a relative 
sense of where larger portions of the 
species are being taken by the Action 
Proponents’ activities and where there 
is a higher likelihood that the same 
individuals are being taken across 
multiple days and where that number of 
days might be higher. It also provides a 
relative picture of the scale of impacts 
to each species. 
In the ocean, unlike a modeling 
simulation with static animals, the 
transient nature of sonar use makes it 
unlikely to repeatedly expose the same 
individual animals within a short 
period, for example, within one specific 
exercise. However, some repeated 
exposures across different activities 
could occur over the year with more 
resident species. In short, we expect the 
total anticipated takes represent 
exposures of a smaller number of 
individuals of which some could be 
exposed multiple times, but, based on 
the nature of the Action Proponents’ 
activities and the movement patterns of 
marine mammals, it is unlikely that any 
particular subset would be taken over 
more than several sequential days (with 
a few possible exceptions discussed in 
the species-specific conclusions). In 
other cases, such as activities that 
overlap habitat of small and resident 
populations, repeated exposures of the 
same individuals may be more likely 
given the likelihood that a smaller 
number of animals would routinely use 
the affected habitat. 
When calculating the proportion of a 
population taken (e.g., the number of takes divided by population 
abundance), which can also be helpful 
in estimating the number of days over 
which some individuals may be taken, 
it is important to choose an appropriate 
population estimate against which to 
make the comparison. Herein, NMFS 
considers two potential abundance 
estimates, the SARs and the NMSDD 
abundance estimates. The SARs, where 
available, provide the official 
population estimate for a given species 
or stock in U.S. waters in a given year. 
These estimates are typically generated 
from the most recent shipboard and/or 
aerial surveys conducted, and in some 
cases, the estimates show substantial 
year-to-year variability. When the stock 
is known to range well outside of U.S. 
EEZ boundaries, population estimates 
based on surveys conducted only within 
the U.S. EEZ are known to be 
underestimates. The NMSDD-derived 
abundance estimates are abundances for 
within the boundaries described for the 
density database for the California and 
Hawaii Study Areas only and, therefore, 
differ from some SAR abundance 
estimates. For the California Study Area, 
the NMSDD abundances are based on 
the extent of the west coast density 
models, which include areas off the Baja 
California peninsula of Mexico to the 
south but are truncated to the north and 
west of the California portion of the 
Study Area as shown in the revised 
Density Technical Report. For some 
species, the NMSDD abundances are 
based on density models that extend up 
to the northern extent of the west coast 
U.S. EEZ, beyond the HCTT Study Area. 
These are noted in the table. In some 
instances, even this larger extent does 
not cover the full range of a species or 
stock. For the Hawaii Study Area, the 
NMSDD abundances are based on a 
buffer around the Hawaiian island 
chain. Thus, island-associated species 
are encompassed, but abundances of 
wider-ranging species may be 
underestimated. 
The SAR and NMSDD abundance 
estimates can differ substantially 
because these estimates may be based 
on different methods and data sources. 
For example, the SARs consider data 
only from the past 8 year period, 
whereas the NMSDD considers a longer 
data history. Further, the SARs estimate 
the number of animals in a population 
but not spatial densities. NMSDD uses 
predictive density models to estimate 
species presence, even where sighting 
data is limited or lacking altogether. 
Each density model is limited to the 
variables and assumptions considered 
by the original data source provider. 
NMFS considered these factors and 
others described in the revised Density 
Technical Report when comparing the 
estimated takes to current population 
abundances for each species or stock.

described above, to estimate repeated 
impacts across large areas relative to

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258961 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations species geographic distributions, 
comparing the impacts predicted in 
NAEMO to abundances predicted using 
the NMSDD models is usually 
preferable. By comparing estimated take 
to the NMSDD abundance estimates, 
impacts and abundance estimates are 
based on the same underlying 
assumptions about a species’ presence. 
NMFS has compared the estimated take 
to the NMSDD abundance estimates 
herein for all stocks, with the exception 
of stocks where the abundance 
information fits into one of the 
following scenarios, in which case 
NMFS concluded that comparison to the 
SAR abundance estimate is more 
appropriate: (1) a species’ or stocks’ 
range extends beyond the U.S. EEZ and 
the SAR abundance estimate is greater 
than the NMSDD abundance. For highly 
migratory species (e.g., large whales) or those whose geographic distribution 
extends beyond the boundaries of the 
HCTT Study Area (e.g., Alaska stocks), comparisons to the SAR are appropriate. 
Many of the stocks present in the HCTT 
Study Area have ranges significantly 
larger than the HCTT Study Area, and 
that abundance is captured by the SAR. 
Therefore: (1) comparing the estimated 
takes to an abundance, in this case the 
SAR abundance, which represents the 
total population, may be more 
appropriate than modeled abundances 
for only the HCTT Study Area; and (2) 
when the current minimum population 
estimate in the SAR is greater than the 
NMSDD abundance, regardless of 
whether the stock range extends beyond 
the EEZ. The NMSDD and SAR 
abundance estimates are both included 
in table 54, table 56, table 58, table 60, 
table 62, and table 64, and each table 
indicates which stock abundance 
estimate was selected for comparison to 
the take estimate for each species or 
stock. 
Temporary Threshold Shift 
NMFS and the Navy have estimated 
that all species of marine mammals may 
incur some level of TTS from active 
sonar. As mentioned previously, in 
general, TTS can last from a few 
minutes to days, be of varying degree, 
and occur across various frequency 
bandwidths, all of which determine the 
severity of the impacts on the affected 
individual, which can range from minor 
to more severe. Table 3 through table 17 
indicate the number of takes by TTS 
that may be incurred by different 
species from exposure to active sonar, 
air guns, pile driving, and explosives. 
The TTS incurred by an animal is 
primarily characterized by three 
characteristics: 
1. Frequency—Available data suggest 
that most TTS occurs in the frequency 
range of the source up to one octave 
higher than the source (with the 
maximum TTS at 
1
2octave above) 
(Finneran, 2015; Southall et al., 2019). 
The Navy’s MF anti-submarine warfare 
sources, which are the highest power 
and most numerous sources and the 
ones that cause the most take by TTS, 
utilize the 1–10 kHz frequency band, 
which suggests that if TTS were to be 
induced by any of these MF sources it 
would be in a frequency band 
somewhere between approximately 1 
and 20 kHz, which is in the range of 
communication calls for many 
odontocetes, but below the range of the 
echolocation signals used for foraging. 
There are fewer hours of HF source use 
and the sounds would attenuate more 
quickly, plus they have lower source 
levels, but if an animal were to incur 
TTS from these sources, it would cover 
a higher frequency range (sources are 
between 10 and 100 kHz, which means 
that TTS could range up to the highest 
frequencies audible to VHF cetaceans, 
approaching 200 kHz), which could 
overlap with the range in which some 
odontocetes communicate or echolocate. 
There are fewer LF sources and the 
majority are used in the more readily 
mitigated testing environment, and TTS 
from LF sources would most likely 
occur below 2 kHz, which is in the 
range where many mysticetes 
communicate and also where other 
auditory cues are located (e.g., waves, snapping shrimp, fish prey). Also of 
note, the majority of sonar sources from 
which TTS may be incurred occupy a 
narrow frequency band, which means 
that the TTS incurred would also be 
across a narrower band (i.e., not affecting the majority of an animal’s 
hearing range). 
2. Degree of the shift (i.e., by how many dB the sensitivity of the hearing 
is reduced)—Generally, both the degree 
of TTS and the duration of TTS will be 
greater if the marine mammal is exposed 
to a higher level of energy (which would 
occur when the peak SPL is higher or 
the duration is longer). The threshold 
for the onset of TTS was discussed in 
the Hearing Loss and Auditory Injury 
section of the proposed rulemaking (90 
FR 32118, July 16, 2025). An animal 
would have to approach closer to the 
source or remain in the vicinity of the 
sound source appreciably longer to 
increase the received SEL, which would 
be difficult considering the Lookouts 
and the nominal speed of an active 
sonar vessel (10–15 kn (18.5–27.8 km/ 
hr)) and the relative motion between the 
sonar vessel and the animal. In the TTS 
studies discussed in the Potential 
Effects of Specified Activities on Marine 
Mammals and Their Habitat section, 
some using exposures of almost 1 hour 
in duration or up to 217 SEL, most of 
the TTS induced was 15 dB or less, 
though Finneran et al. (2007) induced 
43 dB of TTS with a 64-second exposure 
to a 20 kHz source measured via 
auditory steady-state response (auditory 
evoked potential measurement). The 
SQS–53 (MFAS) hull-mounted sonar 
(MF1) nominally emits a short (1- 
second) ping typically every 50 seconds, 
incurring those levels of TTS due to this 
source is highly unlikely. Sources with 
higher duty cycles, such as MF1C (high 
duty cycle hull-mounted sonar) produce 
longer ranges to effects and contribute to 
auditory effects from this action. Since 
most hull-mounted sonar, such as the 
SQS–53, engaged in anti-submarine 
warfare training would be moving at 
between 10 and 15 kn (18.5 to 27.8 km/ 
hr) and nominally pinging every 50 
seconds, the vessel will have traveled a 
minimum distance of approximately 
843.2 ft (257 m) during the time 
between those pings. For a Navy vessel 
moving at a nominal 10 kn (18.5 km/hr), 
it is unlikely a marine mammal would 
track with the ship and could maintain 
speed parallel to the ship to receive 
adequate energy over successive pings 
to suffer TTS. In general, there is a 
higher potential for TTS associated with 
sources with higher duty cycles, like 
continuous hull-mounted sonars, 
compared to those sources that are 
intermittent or have lower duty cycles 
(Kastelein et al., 2015). Though high duty cycle or continuous hull-mounted 
sonars make up a small percentage of 
the Navy’s overall MFAS activities. 
In short, given the anticipated 
duration and levels of sound exposure, 
we would not expect marine mammals 
to incur more than relatively low levels 
of TTS in most cases for sonar exposure. 
To add context to this degree of TTS, 
individual marine mammals may 
regularly experience variations of 6 dB 
differences in hearing sensitivity in 
their lifetime (Finneran et al., 2000; 
Finneran et al., 2002; Schlundt et al., 2000). 
3. Duration of TTS (recovery time)— 
As discussed in the Potential Effects of 
Specified Activities on Marine 
Mammals and Their Habitat section of 
the proposed rulemaking (90 FR 32118, 
July 16, 2025), in TTS laboratory studies 
using exposures of up to an hour in 
duration or up to 217 dB SEL, most 
individuals recovered within 1 day (or 
less, often in minutes) (Kastelein, 
2020b). One study resulted in a recovery 
that took 4 days (Finneran et al., 2015; 
Southall et al., 2019). However, there is VerDate Sep<11>2014  19:02 Dec 16, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00153 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\17DER2.SGM 17DER2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258962 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations evidence that repeated exposures 
resulting in TTS could potentially lead 
to residual threshold shifts that persist 
for longer durations and can result in 
PTS (Reichmuth et al., 2019). 
Compared to laboratory studies, 
marine mammals are likely to 
experience lower SELs from sonar used 
in the HCTT Study Area due to 
movement of the source and animals, 
and because of the lower duty cycles 
typical of higher power sources (though 
some of the Navy MF1C sources have 
higher duty cycles). Therefore, TTS 
resulting from MFAS would likely be of 
lesser magnitude and duration 
compared to laboratory studies. Also, 
for the same reasons discussed above in 
the Diel Cycle section, and because of 
the short distance between the source 
and animals needed to reach high SELs, 
it is unlikely that animals would be 
exposed to the levels necessary to 
induce TTS in subsequent time periods 
such that hearing recovery is impeded. 
Additionally, though the frequency 
range of TTS that marine mammals 
might incur would overlap with some of 
the frequency ranges of their 
vocalization types, the frequency range 
of TTS from MFAS would not usually 
span the entire frequency range of one 
vocalization type, much less span all 
types of vocalizations or other critical 
auditory cues. 
As a general point, the majority of the 
TTS takes are the result of exposure to 
hull-mounted MFAS, with fewer from 
explosives (broad-band lower frequency 
sources), and even fewer from LFAS or 
HFAS sources (narrower band). As 
described above, we expect the majority 
of these takes to be in the form of mild, 
short-term (minutes to hours), narrower 
band (affecting only a portion of the 
animal’s hearing range) TTS. This 
means that for one to several times per 
year, for several minutes, maybe a few 
hours, or at most in limited 
circumstances a few days, a taken 
individual will have diminished hearing 
sensitivity (more than natural variation, 
but nowhere near total deafness). More 
often than not, such an exposure would 
occur within a narrower mid- to higher 
frequency band that may overlap part 
(but not all) of a communication, 
echolocation, or predator range, but 
sometimes across a lower or broader 
bandwidth. The significance of TTS is 
also related to the auditory cues that are 
germane within the time period that the 
animal incurs the TTS. For example, if 
an odontocete has TTS at echolocation 
frequencies, but incurs it at night when 
it is resting and not feeding, it may not 
be as impactful. In short, the expected 
results of any one of these limited 
number of mild TTS occurrences could 
be that: (1) it does not overlap signals 
that are pertinent to that animal in the 
given time period; (2) it overlaps parts 
of signals that are important to the 
animal, but not in a manner that impairs 
interpretation; or (3) it reduces 
detectability of an important signal to a 
small degree for a short amount of 
time—in which case the animal may be 
aware and be able to compensate (but 
there may be slight energetic cost), or 
the animal may have some reduced 
opportunities (e.g., to detect prey) or reduced capabilities to react with 
maximum effectiveness (e.g., to detect a predator or navigate optimally). 
However, it is unlikely that individuals 
would experience repeated or high 
degree TTS overlapping in frequency 
and time with signals critical for 
behaviors that would impact overall 
fitness. 
Auditory Masking or Communication 
Impairment 
The ultimate potential impacts of 
masking on an individual (if it were to 
occur) are similar to those discussed for 
TTS, but an important difference is that 
masking occurs only during the time of 
the signal, versus TTS, which continues 
beyond the duration of the signal. 
Fundamentally, masking is referred to 
as a chronic effect because one of the 
key harmful components of masking is 
its duration—the fact that an animal 
would have reduced ability to hear or 
interpret critical cues becomes much 
more likely to cause a problem the 
longer it occurs. Also inherent in the 
concept of masking is the fact that the 
potential for the effect is present only 
during the times that the animal and the 
source are in close enough proximity for 
the effect to occur (and further, this time 
period would need to coincide with a 
time that the animal was utilizing 
sounds at the masked frequency). As our 
analysis has indicated, because of the 
relative movement of vessels and the 
sound sources primarily involved in 
this rule, we do not expect the 
exposures with the potential for 
masking to be of a long duration. 
Masking is fundamentally more of a 
concern at lower frequencies, because 
low frequency signals propagate 
significantly farther than higher 
frequencies and because they are more 
likely to overlap both the narrower LF 
calls of mysticetes, as well as many non- 
communication cues such as fish and 
invertebrate prey, and geologic sounds 
that inform navigation. Masking is also 
more of a concern from continuous 
sources (versus intermittent sonar 
signals) where there is no quiet time 
between pulses and detection and 
interpretation of auditory signals is 
likely more challenging. For these 
reasons, dense aggregations of, and long 
exposure to, continuous LF activity are 
much more of a concern for masking, 
whereas comparatively short-term 
exposure to the predominantly 
intermittent pulses of often narrow 
frequency range MFAS or HFAS, or 
explosions are not expected to result in 
a meaningful amount of masking. While 
the Action Proponents occasionally use 
LF and more continuous sources, it is 
not in the contemporaneous aggregate 
amounts that would be expected to 
accrue to degrees that would have the 
potential to affect reproductive success 
or survival. Additional detail is 
provided below. 
Standard hull-mounted MFAS 
typically pings every 50 seconds. Some 
hull-mounted anti-submarine sonars can 
also be used in an object detection mode 
known as ‘‘Kingfisher’’ mode (e.g., used on vessels when transiting to and from 
port) where pulse length is shorter but 
pings are much closer together in both 
time and space since the vessel goes 
slower when operating in this mode, 
and during which an increased 
likelihood of masking in the vicinity of 
vessel could be expected. For the 
majority of other sources, the pulse 
length is significantly shorter than hull- 
mounted active sonar, on the order of 
several microseconds to tens of 
milliseconds. Some of the vocalizations 
that many marine mammals make are 
less than 1 second long; so, for example, 
with hull-mounted sonar, there would 
be a 1 in 50 chance (only if the source 
was in close enough proximity for the 
sound to exceed the signal that is being 
detected) that a single vocalization 
might be masked by a ping. However, 
when vocalizations (or series of 
vocalizations) are longer than the 1 
second pulse of hull-mounted sonar, or 
when the pulses are only several 
microseconds long, the majority of most 
animals’ vocalizations would not be 
masked. 
Most anti-submarine warfare sonars 
and countermeasures use MF 
frequencies and a few use LF and HF 
frequencies. Most of these sonar signals 
are limited in the temporal, frequency, 
and spatial domains. The duration of 
most individual sounds is short, lasting 
up to a few seconds each. A few systems 
operate with higher duty cycles or 
nearly continuously, but they typically 
use lower power, which means that an 
animal would have to be closer, or in 
the vicinity for a longer time, to be 
masked to the same degree as by a 
higher level source. Nevertheless, 
masking could occasionally occur at 
closer ranges to these high-duty cycle 
and continuous active sonar systems,

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258963 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations but as described previously, it would be 
expected to be of a short duration. 
While data are lacking on behavioral 
responses of marine mammals to 
continuously active sonars, mysticete 
species are known to habituate to novel 
and continuous sounds (Nowacek et al., 
2004), suggesting that they are likely to 
have similar responses to high-duty 
cycle sonars. Furthermore, most of these 
systems are hull-mounted on surface 
ships with the ships moving at least 10 
kn (18.5 km/hr), and it is unlikely that 
the ship and the marine mammal would 
continue to move in the same direction 
and the marine mammal subjected to 
the same exposure due to that 
movement. Most anti-submarine warfare 
activities are geographically dispersed 
and last for only a few hours, often with 
intermittent sonar use even within this 
period. Most anti-submarine warfare 
sonars also have a narrow frequency 
band (typically less than one-third 
octave). These factors reduce the 
likelihood of sources causing significant 
masking. HF signals (above 10 kHz) 
attenuate more rapidly in the water due 
to absorption than do lower frequency 
signals, thus producing only a very 
small zone of potential masking. If 
masking or communication impairment 
were to occur briefly, it would more 
likely be in the frequency range of 
MFAS (the more powerful source), 
which overlaps with some odontocete 
vocalizations (but few mysticete 
vocalizations); however, it would likely 
not mask the entirety of any particular 
vocalization, communication series, or 
other critical auditory cue, because the 
signal length, frequency, and duty cycle 
of the MFAS/HFAS signal does not 
perfectly resemble the characteristics of 
any single marine mammal species’ 
vocalizations. 
Other sources used in the Action 
Proponents’ training and testing that are 
not explicitly addressed above, many of 
either higher frequencies (meaning that 
the sounds generated attenuate even 
closer to the source) or used less 
frequently, would be expected to 
contribute to masking over far smaller 
areas and/or times. For the reasons 
described here, any limited masking 
that could potentially occur would be 
minor and short-term. 
In conclusion, masking is more likely 
to occur in the presence of broadband, 
relatively continuous noise sources such 
as from vessels; however, the duration 
of temporal and spatial overlap with any 
individual animal and the spatially 
separated sources that the Action 
Proponents use are not expected to 
result in more than short-term, low 
impact masking that will not affect 
reproduction or survival. 
Auditory Injury From Sonar Acoustic 
Sources and Explosives and Non- 
Auditory Injury From Explosives 
Table 3 through table 17 indicate the 
number of takes of each species by Level 
A harassment in the form of auditory 
injury resulting from exposure to active 
sonar and/or explosives estimated to 
occur, and table 19 indicates the totals 
across all activities. The number of takes 
estimated to result from auditory injury 
annually from sonar, air guns, and 
explosives for each species/stock from 
all activities combined ranges from 0 to 
1,235 (the 1,235 is for the CA/OR/WA 
stock of Dall’s porpoise). Thirty-two 
stocks have the potential to incur non- 
auditory injury from explosives, and the 
number of individuals from any given 
stock from all activities combined 
ranges from 1 to 71 (the 71 is for the CA/ 
OR/WA stock of short-beaked common 
dolphin). As described previously, the 
Navy’s model likely overestimates the 
number of injurious takes to some 
degree. Nonetheless, these Level A 
harassment take numbers represent the 
maximum number of instances in which 
marine mammals would be reasonably 
expected to incur auditory and/or non- 
auditory injury, and we have analyzed 
them accordingly. 
If a marine mammal is able to 
approach a surface vessel within the 
distance necessary to incur auditory 
injury in spite of the mitigation 
measures, the likely speed of the vessel 
(nominally 10–15 kn (18.5–27.8 km/hr)) 
and relative motion of the vessel would 
make it very difficult for the animal to 
remain in range long enough to 
accumulate enough energy to result in 
more than a mild case of auditory 
injury. As discussed previously in 
relation to TTS, the likely consequences 
to the health of an individual that incurs 
auditory injury can range from mild to 
more serious and is dependent upon the 
degree of auditory injury and the 
frequency band associated with auditory 
injury. The majority of any auditory 
injury incurred as a result of exposure 
to Navy sources would be expected to 
be in the 2–20 kHz range (resulting from 
the most powerful hull-mounted sonar) 
and could overlap a small portion of the 
communication frequency range of 
many odontocetes, whereas other 
marine mammal groups have 
communication calls at lower 
frequencies. Because of the broadband 
nature of explosives, auditory injury 
incurred from exposure to explosives 
would occur over a lower, but wider, 
frequency range. Permanent loss of 
some degree of hearing is a normal 
occurrence for older animals, and many 
animals are able to compensate for the 
shift, both in old age or at younger ages 
as the result of stressor exposure. While 
a small loss of hearing sensitivity may 
include some degree of energetic costs 
for compensating or may mean some 
small loss of opportunities or detection 
capabilities, at the expected scale it 
would be unlikely to impact behaviors, 
opportunities, or detection capabilities 
to a degree that would interfere with 
reproductive success or survival. 
The Action Proponents implement 
mitigation measures (described in the 
Mitigation Measures section) during 
explosive activities, including delaying 
detonations when a marine mammal is 
observed in the mitigation zone. Nearly 
all explosive events will occur during 
daylight hours thereby improving the 
sightability of marine mammals and 
mitigation effectiveness. Observing for 
marine mammals during the explosive 
activities will include visual and 
passive acoustic detection methods (the 
latter when they are available and part 
of the activity) before the activity 
begins, in order to cover the mitigation 
zones that can range from 200 yd (183 
m) to 2,500 yd (2,286 m) depending on 
the source (e.g., explosive sonobuoy, explosive torpedo, explosive bombs), 
and 2.5 nmi (4.6 km) for sinking 
exercises (see table 25 through table 34). 
The type and amount of take by Level 
A harassment are indicated for all 
species and species groups in table 54, 
table 56, table 58, table 60, table 62, and 
table 64. Generally speaking, non- 
auditory injuries from explosives could 
range from minor lung injuries (the most 
sensitive organ and first to be affected) 
that consist of some short-term 
reduction of health and fitness 
immediately following the injury that 
heals quickly and will not have any 
discernible long-term effects, up to more 
impactful permanent injuries across 
multiple organs that may cause health 
problems and negatively impact 
reproductive success (i.e., increase the time between pregnancies or even 
render reproduction unlikely) but fall 
just short of a ‘‘serious injury’’ by virtue 
of the fact that the animal is not 
expected to die. Nonetheless, due to the 
Navy’s mitigation and detection 
capabilities, we would not expect 
marine mammals to typically be 
exposed to a more severe blast located 
closer to the source—so the impacts 
likely would be less severe. In addition, 
most non-auditory injuries and 
mortalities or serious injuries are 
predicted for stocks with medium to 
large group sizes, mostly delphinids, 
which increases sightability. It is still 
difficult to evaluate how these injuries 
may or may not impact an animal’s 
fitness; however, these effects are seen

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258964 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations only in limited numbers (single digits 
for all but three stocks) and mostly in 
species of moderate, high, and very high 
abundances. In short, it is unlikely that 
any, much less all, of the limited 
number of injuries accrued to any one 
stock would result in reduced 
reproductive success of any individuals. 
Even if a few injuries did result in 
reduced reproductive success of 
individuals, the status of the affected 
stocks are such that it would not be 
expected to adversely impact rates of 
reproduction (and auditory injury of the 
low severity anticipated here is not 
expected to affect the survival of any 
individual marine mammals). 
Serious Injury and Mortality 
NMFS is authorizing a very limited 
number of serious injuries or mortalities 
that could occur in the event of a vessel 
strike or as a result of marine mammal 
exposure to explosive detonations. We 
note here that the takes from potential 
vessel strikes or explosive exposures 
enumerated below could result in non- 
serious injury, but their worst potential 
outcome (i.e., mortality) is analyzed for the purposes of the negligible impact 
determination. 
The MMPA requires that PBR be 
estimated in SARs and that it be used 
in applications related to the 
management of take incidental to 
commercial fisheries (i.e., the take reduction planning process described in 
section 118 of the MMPA and the 
determination of whether a stock is 
‘‘strategic’’ as defined in section 3). 
While nothing in the statute requires the 
application of PBR outside the 
management of commercial fisheries 
interactions with marine mammals, 
NMFS recognizes that as a quantitative 
metric, PBR may be useful as a 
consideration when evaluating the 
impacts of other human-caused 
activities on marine mammal stocks. 
Outside the commercial fishing context, 
and in consideration of all known 
human-caused mortality, PBR can help 
inform the potential effects of M/SI 
requested to be authorized under 
section 101(a)(5)(A) of the MMPA. As 
noted by NMFS and the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service in our implementing 
regulations for the 1986 amendments to 
the MMPA (54 FR 40341, September 29, 
1989), the Services consider many 
factors, when available, in making a 
negligible impact determination, 
including, but not limited to: (1) the 
status of the species or stock relative to 
optimum sustainable population (OSP) 
(if known); (2) whether the recruitment 
rate for the species or stock is 
increasing, decreasing, stable, or 
unknown; (3) the size and distribution 
of the population; and (4) existing 
impacts and environmental conditions. 
In this multi-factor analysis, PBR can be 
a useful indicator for when, and to what 
extent, the agency should take an 
especially close look at the 
circumstances associated with the 
potential mortality, along with any other 
factors that could influence annual rates 
of recruitment or survival. 
Below we describe how PBR is 
considered in NMFS M/SI analysis. 
Please see the 2020 Northwest Training 
and Testing Final Rule (85 FR 72312, 
November 12, 2020) for a background 
discussion of PBR and how it was 
adopted for use authorizing incidental 
take under MMPA section 101(a)(5)(A) 
for specified activities such as the 
Action Proponents’ training and testing 
in the HCTT Study Area. 
When considering PBR during 
evaluation of effects of M/SI under 
MMPA section 101(a)(5)(A), we utilize a 
two-tiered analysis for each stock for 
which M/SI is proposed for 
authorization: 
Tier 1: Compare the total human- 
caused average annual M/SI estimate 
from all sources, including the M/SI 
proposed for authorization from the 
specific activity, to PBR. If the total M/ 
SI estimate is less than or equal to PBR, 
then the specific activity is considered 
to have a negligible impact on that 
stock. If the total M/SI estimate 
(including from the specific activity) 
exceeds PBR, conduct the Tier 2 
analysis. 
Tier 2: Evaluate the estimated M/SI 
from the specified activity relative to the 
stock’s PBR. If the M/SI from the 
specified activity is less than or equal to 
10 percent of PBR and other major 
sources of human-caused mortality have 
mitigation in place, then the individual 
specified activity is considered to have 
a negligible impact on that stock. If the 
estimate exceeds 10 percent of PBR, 
then, absent other mitigating factors, the 
specified activity could be considered 
likely to have a non-negligible impact 
on that stock and additional analysis is 
necessary. 
Additional detail regarding the two 
tiers of the evaluation is provided 
below. 
As indicated above, the goal of the 
Tier 1 assessment is to determine 
whether total annual human-caused 
mortality, including from the specified 
activity, would exceed PBR. To aid in 
the Tier 1 evaluation and get a clearer 
picture of the amount of annual M/SI 
that remains without exceeding PBR, for 
each species or stock, we first calculate 
a ‘‘residual PBR,’’ which equals PBR 
minus the ongoing annual human- 
caused M/SI (i.e., Residual PBR = PBR¥(annual M/SI estimate from the 
SAR + other M/SI authorized under 
section 101(a)(5)(A) of the MMPA)). If 
the ongoing human-caused M/SI from 
other sources does not exceed PBR, then 
residual PBR is a positive number, and 
we consider how the proposed 
authorized incidental M/SI from the 
specified activities being evaluated 
compares to residual PBR using the Tier 
1 framework in the following paragraph. 
If the ongoing anthropogenic mortality 
from other sources already exceeds PBR, 
then residual PBR is a negative number 
and we move to the Tier 2 discussion 
further below to consider the M/SI from 
the specific activities. 
To reiterate, the Tier 1 analysis 
overview in the context of residual PBR, 
if the M/SI from the specified activity 
does not exceed PBR, the impacts of the 
authorized M/SI on the species or stock 
are generally considered to be 
negligible. As a simplifying analytical 
tool in the Tier 1 evaluation, we first 
consider whether the M/SI from the 
specified activities could cause 
incidental M/SI that is less than 10 
percent of residual PBR, which we 
consider an ‘‘insignificance threshold.’’ 
If so, we consider M/SI from the 
specified activities to represent an 
insignificant incremental increase in 
ongoing anthropogenic M/SI for the 
marine mammal stock in question that 
alone will clearly not adversely affect 
annual rates of recruitment and survival 
and for which additional analysis or 
discussion of the anticipated M/SI is not 
required because the negligible impact 
standard clearly will not be exceeded on 
that basis alone. 
When the M/SI from the specified 
activity is above the insignificance 
threshold in the Tier 1 evaluation, it 
does not indicate that the M/SI 
associated with the specified activities 
is necessarily approaching a level that 
would exceed negligible impact. Rather, 
it is used as a cue to look more closely 
if and when the M/SI for the specified 
activity approaches residual PBR, as it 
becomes increasingly necessary (the 
closer the M/SI from the specified 
activity is to 100 percent residual PBR) 
to carefully consider whether there are 
other factors that could affect 
reproduction or survival, such as take 
by Level A and/or Level B harassment 
that has been predicted to impact 
reproduction or survival of individuals, 
or other considerations such as 
information that illustrates high 
uncertainty involved in the calculation 
of PBR for some stocks. Recognizing that 
the impacts of harassment of any 
authorized incidental take (by Level A 
or Level B harassment from the 
specified activities) would not combine

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258965 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations with the effects of the authorized M/SI 
to adversely affect the stock through 
effects on recruitment or survival, if the 
proposed authorized M/SI for the 
specified activity is less than residual 
PBR, the M/SI, alone, would be 
considered to have a negligible impact 
on the species or stock. If the proposed 
authorized M/SI is greater than residual 
PBR, then the assessment should 
proceed to Tier 2. 
For the Tier 2 evaluation, recognizing 
that the total annual human-caused M/ 
SI exceeds PBR, we consider whether 
the incremental effects of the proposed 
authorized M/SI for the specified 
activity, specifically, would be expected 
to result in a negligible impact on the 
affected species or stocks. For the Tier 
2 assessment, consideration of other 
factors (positive or negative), including 
those described above (e.g., the certainty in the data underlying PBR and the 
impacts of any harassment authorized 
for the specified activity), as well as the 
mitigation in place to reduce M/SI from 
other activities is especially important 
to assessing the impacts of the M/SI 
from the specified activity on the 
species or stock. PBR is a conservative 
metric and not sufficiently precise to 
serve as an absolute predictor of 
population effects upon which mortality 
caps would appropriately be based. For 
example, in some cases stock abundance 
(which is one of three key inputs into 
the PBR calculation) is underestimated 
because marine mammal survey data 
within the U.S. EEZ are used to 
calculate the abundance even when the 
stock range extends well beyond the 
U.S. EEZ. An underestimate of 
abundance could result in an 
underestimate of PBR. Alternatively, we 
sometimes may not have complete M/SI 
data beyond the U.S. EEZ to compare to 
PBR, which could result in an 
overestimate of residual PBR. The 
accuracy and certainty around the data 
that feed any PBR calculation, such as 
the abundance estimates, must be 
carefully considered to evaluate 
whether the calculated PBR accurately 
reflects the circumstances of the 
particular stock. 
As referenced above, in some cases 
the ongoing human-caused mortality 
from activities other than those being 
evaluated already exceeds PBR and, 
therefore, residual PBR is negative. In 
these cases, any additional mortality 
would result in greater exceedance of 
PBR. PBR is helpful in informing the 
analysis of the effects of mortality on a 
species or stock because it is important 
from a biological perspective to be able 
to consider how the total mortality in a 
given year may affect the population. 
However, section 101(a)(5)(A) of the 
MMPA indicates that NMFS shall 
authorize the requested incidental take 
from a specified activity if we find that 
‘‘the total of such taking [i.e., from the specified activity] will have a negligible 
impact on such species or stock.’’ In 
other words, the task under the statute 
is to evaluate the applicant’s anticipated 
take in relation to their take’s impact on 
the species or stock, not other entities’ 
impacts on the species or stock. Neither 
the MMPA, nor NMFS’ implementing 
regulations call for consideration of 
other unrelated activities and their 
impacts on the species or stock. 
Accordingly, we may find that the 
impacts of the taking from the specified 
activity may (alone) be negligible even 
when total human-caused mortality 
from all activities exceeds PBR (in the 
context of a particular species or stock). 
Specifically, where the authorized M/SI 
would be less than or equal to 10 
percent of PBR and management 
measures are being taken to address M/ 
SI from the other contributing activities 
(i.e., other than the specified activities covered by the ITA under 
consideration), the impacts of the 
authorized M/SI would be considered 
negligible. In addition, we must also 
still determine that any impacts on the 
species or stock from other types of take 
(i.e., harassment) caused by the applicant do not combine with the 
impacts from mortality or serious injury 
addressed here to result in adverse 
effects on the species or stock through 
effects on annual rates of recruitment or 
survival. 
As noted above, while PBR is useful 
in informing the evaluation of the 
effects of M/SI in MMPA section 
101(a)(5)(A) determinations, it is one 
consideration to be assessed in 
combination with other factors and is 
not determinative. For example, as 
explained above, the accuracy and 
certainty of the data used to calculate 
PBR for the species or stock must be 
considered. And we reiterate the 
considerations discussed above for why 
it is not appropriate to consider PBR an 
absolute cap in the application of this 
guidance. Accordingly, we use PBR as a 
trigger for concern while also 
considering other relevant factors to 
provide a reasonable and appropriate 
means of evaluating the effects of 
potential mortality on rates of 
recruitment and survival, while 
acknowledging that it is possible for 
total human-caused M/SI to exceed PBR 
(or for the M/SI from the specified 
activity to exceed 10 percent of PBR in 
the case where other human-caused 
mortality is exceeding PBR, as described 
in the last paragraph) and still make a 
negligible impact determination under 
MMPA section 101(a)(5)(A). 
We note that on June 17, 2020, NMFS 
finalized new Criteria for Determining 
Negligible Impact under MMPA section 
101(a)(5)(E). The guidance explicitly 
notes the differences in the negligible 
impact determinations required under 
paragraph 101(a)(5)(E), as compared to 
paragraphs (a)(5)(A) and (D) of section 
101, and specifies that the procedure in 
that document is limited to how the 
agency conducts negligible impact 
analyses for commercial fisheries under 
section 101(a)(5)(E). In this rule, NMFS 
has described its method for considering 
PBR to evaluate the effects of potential 
mortality in the negligible impact 
analysis. NMFS has reviewed the 2020 
guidance and determined that our 
consideration of PBR in the evaluation 
of mortality as described above and in 
the rule remains appropriate for use in 
the negligible impact analysis for the 
Action Proponents’ activities under 
section 101(a)(5)(A). 
Our evaluation of the M/SI for each of 
the species and stocks for which 
mortality or serious injury could occur 
follows. 
We first consider maximum potential 
incidental M/SI from the vessel strike 
analysis for the affected large whales 
(table 52) and from the Action 
Proponents’ explosive detonations for 
the affected small cetaceans and 
pinnipeds (table 53) in consideration of 
NMFS’ threshold for identifying 
insignificant M/SI take. By considering 
the maximum potential incidental M/SI 
in relation to PBR and ongoing sources 
of anthropogenic mortality, as described 
above, we begin our evaluation of 
whether the potential incremental 
addition of M/SI through vessel strikes 
and explosive detonations may affect 
the species’ or stocks’ annual rates of 
recruitment or survival. We also 
consider the interaction of those 
mortalities with incidental taking of that 
species or stock by harassment pursuant 
to the specified activity. 
Based on the methods discussed 
previously, NMFS is authorizing nine 
mortalities of large whales due to vessel 
strike over the course of the 7-year rule, 
seven by the Navy and two by the Coast 
Guard (table 52). Across the 7-year 
duration of the rule, six takes by 
mortality (annual average of 0.86 takes) 
of fin whale (CA/OR/WA stock) could 
occur and are authorized; three takes by 
mortality (annual average of 0.43 takes) 
of gray whale (Eastern North Pacific 
stock) and humpback whale (Hawaii 
stock) could occur and are authorized; 
two takes by mortality (annual average 
of 0.29 takes) of blue whale (Eastern 
North Pacific stock), sei whale (Eastern

M/SI that could potentially accrue to the specified species or stock as 
indicated in the SAR and includes M/SI from fisheries interactions and other sources. 58970 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations BILLING CODE 3510–22–C 
As described above, NMFS M/SI 
analysis includes two Tiers and our 
discussion is organized into sections 
that mirror that framework, as 
applicable. Specifically, we standardly 
first address stocks analyzed within Tier 
1 (i.e., those for which total known human-caused M/SI is below PBR (i.e., 
the M/SI from the specified activity is 
below residual PBR)), considering those 
with proposed M/SI both below and 
above the insignificance threshold. 
Then, if applicable, we discuss stocks 
for which total mortality exceeds PBR in 
a Tier 2 analysis in which we compare 
the proposed M/SI of the specified 
activity alone against PBR and consider 
other factors as necessary. Of note, for 
some stocks total M/SI is not known, in 
which case a Tier 1 analysis is not 
possible and, therefore, we move 
directly to a Tier 2 analysis. In rare 
cases, PBR itself cannot be calculated, in 
which case we consider other known 
factors and/or surrogate stocks to inform 
the negligible impact determination 
analysis. 
Stocks With Total Average Annual 
Human-Caused M/SI Below PBR (Tier 1) 
and Authorized M/SI From the 
Specified Activity Is Below the 
Insignificance Threshold— 
As noted above, for a species or stock 
with authorized M/SI less than 10 
percent of residual PBR, we consider M/ 
SI from the specified activities to 
represent a clearly insignificant 
incremental increase in ongoing 
anthropogenic M/SI that alone (i.e., in the absence of any other take and 
barring any other unusual 
circumstances) will clearly not 
adversely affect annual rates of 
recruitment and survival. In this case, as 
shown in table 52 and table 53, the 
following species or stocks have 
potential for estimated take by M/SI 
from vessel strike and explosives, 
respectively, and authorized below their 
insignificance threshold: fin whale (CA/ 
OR/WA stock); humpback whale 
(Mainland Mexico—CA/OR/WA and 
Hawaii stocks); gray whale (Eastern 
North Pacific stock); sperm whale 
(Hawaii stock); bottlenose dolphin 
(Hawaii pelagic stock); long-beaked 
common dolphin (California stock); 
northern right whale dolphin (CA/OR/ 
WA stock); Pacific white-sided dolphin 
(CA/OR/WA stock); rough-toothed 
dolphin (Hawaii stock); short-beaked 
common dolphin (CA/OR/WA stock); 
striped dolphin (CA/OR/WA stock); 
California sea lion (U.S. stock); 
Guadalupe fur seal (Mexico stock); and 
harbor seal (California stock). For the 
stocks with authorized M/SI below the 
insignificance threshold, there are no 
other known factors, information, or 
unusual circumstances that indicate 
anticipated M/SI below the 
insignificance threshold could have 
adverse effects on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival and they are not 
discussed further. 
Stocks With Total Average Annual 
Human-Caused M/SI Below PBR (Tier 1) 
and Authorized M/SI Is Above the 
Insignificance Threshold— 
Sei Whale (Eastern North Pacific Stock) 
For sei whales (Eastern North Pacific 
stock), PBR is currently set at 1.25. The 
total annual M/SI is zero, yielding a 
residual PBR of 1.25. NMFS is 
authorizing one M/SI for the Navy and 
one for the Coast Guard over the 7-year 
duration of the rule (two total; indicated 
as 0.29 annually for the purposes of 
comparing to PBR and evaluating 
overall effects on annual rates of 
recruitment and survival), which leaves 
a PBR remainder of 0.96. 
As described above, if the total M/SI 
estimate is less than or equal to PBR, 
which is the case here, then the 
specified activity is considered to have 
a negligible impact on that stock. 
Although the M/SI from takes 
authorized here for the specified activity 
is above the insignificance threshold, as 
described above, that does not indicate 
that the M/SI associated with the 
specified activities is necessarily 
approaching a level that would exceed 
negligible impact. Rather, it is used as 
a cue to look more closely if and when 
the M/SI for the specified activity 
approaches residual PBR, as it becomes 
increasingly necessary (the closer the 
M/SI from the specified activity is to 
100 percent residual PBR) to carefully 
consider whether there are other factors 
that could affect reproduction or 
survival. Here, the M/SI is not closely 
approaching residual PBR (PBR 
remainder is 0.96) and there are no 
other factors that would suggest that the 
authorized mortality (alone) would have 
more than a negligible impact on this 
stock. 
As described previously, NMFS must 
also ensure that impacts by the 
applicant on the species or stock from 
other types of take (i.e., harassment) do not combine with the impacts from 
mortality to adversely affect the species 
or stock via impacts on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival, which occurs 
further below in the Group and Species- 
Specific Analyses section. 
Additionally of note, management 
measures are in place to address M/SI 
caused by other activities. NOAA 
annually issues voluntary vessel speed 
reduction (VSR) requests that are 
scheduled to be in effect May 1 to 
December 31 off San Francisco, 
Monterey, and Southern California

Cordell Bank, Monterey Bay, Chumash 
Heritage and Channel Islands national 
marine sanctuaries (NMSs) and in 
partnership with the Blue Whales Blue 
Skies program (note that in 2025, the 
Southern California VSR was extended 
in 2025 to cover Chumash Heritage 
NMS). Vessels transiting the area from 
May 1 through December 31, 2025 are 
recommended to exercise caution and 
voluntarily reduce speed to 10 kn (18.5 
km/hour) or less. 
The Channel Islands NMS staff 
coordinates, collects, and monitors 
whale sightings in and around the VSR 
zones and the Channel Islands NMS 
region. The seasonally established 
Southern California VSR zone spans 
from Point Arguello to Dana Point, 
including the Traffic Separation 
Schemes in the Santa Barbara Channel 
and San Pedro Channel. Channel Island 
NMS observers collect information from 
aerial surveys conducted by NOAA, the 
U.S. Coast Guard, California Department 
of Fish and Game, and U.S. Navy 
chartered aircraft. Information on 
seasonal presence, movement, and 
general distribution patterns of large 
whales is shared with mariners, NMFS, 
U.S. Coast Guard, California Department 
of Fish and Game, the Santa Barbara 
Museum of Natural History, the Marine 
Exchange of Southern California, and 
whale scientists. Real time and 
historical whale observation data 
collected from multiple sources can be 
viewed on the Point Blue Whale 
Database. The Blue Whales Blue Skies 
program states that enrollment and 
cooperation rates from participating 
shipping lines have increased every year 
since the program began in 2014. The 
program further estimates that risk of 
fatal vessel strikes to endangered whales 
was reduced by approximately 50 
percent in 2024. As such, while vessel 
strike risk is not eliminated by these 
measures, the risk is significantly 
reduced by this meaningful mitigation 
scheme. 
As stated in the 2023 SAR, the 
California swordfish drift gillnet fishery 
is the most likely U.S. fishery to interact 
with Eastern North Pacific sei whales, 
though there are zero estimated annual 
takes from this fishery given no 
observed entanglements from 1990 to 
2021 across 9,246 observed fishing sets 
(Carretta et al., 2022). NMFS established the Pacific Offshore Cetacean Take 
Reduction Team (POCTRT) in 1996 and 
prepared an associated Plan to reduce 
the risk of M/SI via fisheries 
interactions incidental to the California/ 
Oregon thresher shark/swordfish drift 
gillnet fishery. In 1997, NMFS 
published final regulations formalizing 
the requirements of the Plan, including 
the use of pingers following several 
specific provisions and the employment 
of Skipper education workshops. While 
the POCTRT is still active, the fishery is 
expected to be phased out entirely by 
2027 following passage of the Driftnet 
Modernization and Bycatch Reduction 
Act by the U.S. Congress in 2022. As 
such, within 2 years of the effective 
period of this rule, NMFS does not 
anticipate mortality from this fishery. 
Short-Finned Pilot Whale (CA/OR/WA 
Stock) 
For the CA/OR/WA stock of short- 
finned pilot whale, PBR is currently set 
at 4.5, the total annual M/SI is estimated 
at 1.2, and the total annual authorized 
take from SWFSC Fisheries and 
Ecosystem Research Activities in the 
California Current is 0.4, yielding a 
residual PBR of 2.9. NMFS is 
authorizing four M/SIs (U.S. Navy only) 
over the 7-year duration of the rule 
(indicated as 0.57 annually for the 
purposes of comparing to PBR and 
evaluating overall effects on annual 
rates of recruitment and survival), 
which leaves a PBR remainder of 2.33. 
As described above, if the total M/SI 
estimate is less than or equal to PBR, 
which is the case here, then the specific 
activity is considered to have a 
negligible impact on that stock. 
Although the M/SI from takes 
authorized here for the specified activity 
is above the insignificance threshold, as 
described above, that does not indicate 
that the M/SI associated with the 
specified activities is necessarily 
approaching a level that would exceed 
negligible impact. Rather, it is used as 
a cue to look more closely if and when 
the M/SI for the specified activity 
approaches residual PBR, as it becomes 
increasingly necessary (the closer the 
M/SI from the specified activity is to 
100 percent residual PBR) to carefully 
consider whether there are other factors 
that could affect reproduction or 
survival. Here, the M/SI is not closely 
approaching residual PBR (PBR 
remainder is 2.33) and there are no 
other factors that would suggest that the 
authorized mortality (alone) would have 
more than a negligible impact on this 
stock. 
As described previously, NMFS must 
also ensure that impacts by the 
applicant on the species or stock from 
other types of take (i.e., harassment) do not combine with the impacts from 
mortality to adversely affect the species 
or stock via impacts on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival, which occurs 
further below in the Group and Species- 
Specific Analyses section. 
As reported in the SAR, the total 
annual M/SI of this stock (1.2) is from 
the CA/OR thresher shark/swordfish 
drift gillnet fishery. NMFS established 
the POCTRT in 1996 and prepared an 
associated Plan to reduce the risk of M/ 
SI via fisheries interactions incidental to 
the California/Oregon thresher shark/ 
swordfish drift gillnet fishery. In 1997, 
NMFS published final regulations 
formalizing the requirements of the 
Plan, including the use of pingers

and the employment of Skipper

POCTRT is still active, the fishery is

2027 following passage of the Driftnet 
Modernization and Bycatch Reduction 
Act by the U.S. Congress in 2022. As 
such, within 2 years of the effective 
period of this rule, NMFS does not 
anticipate additional mortality from this 
fishery. 
Stocks With Total Average Annual 
Human-Caused Mortality Above PBR 
(Tier 2)— 
Blue Whale (Eastern North Pacific 
Stock) 
For blue whales (Eastern North Pacific 
stock), PBR is currently set at 4.1 and 
the total annual M/SI is estimated at 
greater than or equal to 18.6, yielding a 
residual PBR of ¥14.5. NMFS is 
authorizing one M/SI for the Navy and 
one for the Coast Guard over the 7-year 
duration of the rule (two total; indicated 
as 0.29 annually for the purposes of 
comparing to PBR and evaluating 
overall effects on annual rates of 
recruitment and survival), which leaves 
a PBR remainder of ¥14.79. However, 
given that the negligible impact 
determination is based on the 
assessment of take of the activity being 
analyzed, when total annual mortality 
from human activities is higher, but the 
impacts from the specific activity being 
analyzed are very small, NMFS may still 
find the incremental impact of the 
authorized take from a specified activity 
is negligible even if total human-caused 
mortality exceeds PBR. Specifically, for 
example, if the authorized mortality is 
less than 10 percent of PBR and 
management measures are being taken 
to address serious injuries and 
mortalities from the other activities 
causing mortality (i.e., other than the specified activities covered by the ITA 
in consideration). When those 
considerations are applied here, the 
authorized lethal take (0.29 annually) of 
blue whales from the Eastern North 
Pacific stock is less than 10 percent of 
PBR (which is 4.1), and there are 
management measures in place to

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258972 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations address M/SI from activities other than 
those the Action Proponents are 
conducting (as discussed below). 
Immediately below, we explain the 
information that supports our finding 
that the Action Proponents’ authorized 
M/SI is not expected to result in more 
than a negligible impact on this stock. 
As described previously, NMFS must 
also ensure that impacts by the 
applicant on the species or stock from 
other types of take (i.e., harassment) do not combine with the impacts from 
mortality to adversely affect the species 
or stock via impacts on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival, which occurs 
further below in the Group and Species- 
Specific Analyses section. 
Based on identical simulations as 
those conducted to identify Recovery 
Factors for PBR in Wade et al. (1998), 
but where values less than 0.1 were 
investigated (P. Wade, pers. comm.), we 
predict that where the mortality from a 
specified activity does not exceed N
min
 
* 
1
2Rmax * 0.013, the contemplated 
mortality for the specific activity will 
not delay the time to recovery by more 
than 1 percent. For this stock of blue 
whales, N
min
* 
1
2Rmax * 0.013 = 0.459. 
The annual mortality authorized is 0.29 
(i.e., less than 0.459). This means that the mortality authorized in this rule for 
HCTT activities will not delay the time 
to recovery to OSP by more than 1 
percent. 
The 2018 draft SAR and the more 
recent SARs incorporate a method to 
estimate annual deaths by vessel strike 
utilizing an encounter theory model that 
combined species distribution models of 
whale density, vessel traffic 
characteristics, and whale movement 
patterns obtained from satellite-tagged 
animals in the region to estimate 
encounters that would result in 
mortality (Rockwood et al., 2017). The 
model predicts 18 annual mortalities of 
blue whales from vessel strikes, which, 
with the additional M/SI of 1.54 from 
fisheries interactions, results in a 
residual PBR of ¥15.4. Although 
NMFS’ Permits and Conservation 
Division in the Office of Protected 
Resources has independently reviewed 
the vessel strike model and its results 
and agrees that it is appropriate for 
estimating blue whale mortality by 
vessel strike on the U.S. West Coast, for 
analytical purposes we also note that if 
the historical method were used to 
predict vessel strike (i.e., using observed mortality by vessel strike, or 0.6, instead 
of 18), then total human-caused 
mortality including the Action 
Proponents’ potential take would not 
exceed PBR. We further note that the 
authors (Rockwood et al., 2017) do not 
suggest that vessel strike suddenly 
increased to 18 recently. In fact, the 
model is not specific to a year, but 
rather offers a generalized prediction of 
vessel strike off the U.S. West Coast. 
Therefore, if the Rockwood et al. (2017) 
model is an accurate representation of 
vessel strike, then similar levels of 
vessel strike have been occurring in past 
years as well. Put another way, if the 
model is correct, for some number of 
years total-human-caused mortality has 
been significantly underestimated and 
PBR has been similarly exceeded by a 
notable amount, and yet, the Eastern 
North Pacific stock of blue whales 
remains stable nevertheless. 
NMFS’ 2023 SAR states that the 
current population trend is unknown, 
though there may be evidence of a 
population size increase since the 
1990s. The SAR further cites to 
Monnahan et al. (2015), which used a population dynamics model to estimate 
that the Eastern North Pacific blue 
whale population was at 97 percent of 
carrying capacity in 2013 and to suggest 
that the observed lack of a population 
increase since the early 1990s was 
explained by density dependence, not 
impacts from vessel strike. This would 
mean that this stock of blue whales 
shows signs of stability and is not 
increasing in population size because 
the population size is at or nearing 
carrying capacity for its available 
habitat. In fact, we note that this 
population has maintained this status 
throughout the years that the Navy has 
consistently tested and trained at 
similar levels (with similar vessel 
traffic) in areas that overlap with blue 
whale occurrence, which would be 
another indicator of population 
stability. 
Monnahan et al. (2015) modeled vessel numbers, vessel strikes, and the 
population of the Eastern North Pacific 
blue whale population from 1905 out to 
2050 using a Bayesian framework to 
incorporate informative biological 
information and assign probability 
distributions to parameters and derived 
quantities of interest. The authors tested 
multiple scenarios with differing 
assumptions, incorporated uncertainty, 
and further tested the sensitivity of 
multiple variables. Their results 
indicated that there is no immediate 
threat (i.e., through 2050) to the population from any of the scenarios 
tested, which included models with 10 
and 35 strike mortalities per year. 
Broadly, the authors concluded that, 
unlike other blue whale stocks, the 
Eastern North Pacific blue whales have 
recovered from 70 years of whaling and 
are in no immediate threat from vessel 
strikes. They further noted that their 
conclusion conflicts with the depleted 
and strategic designation under the 
MMPA as well as PBR specifically. 
As discussed, we also take into 
consideration management measures in 
place to address M/SI caused by other 
activities. Redfern et al. (2013) note that 
the most risky area for blue whales is 
the Santa Barbara Channel, where 
shipping lanes intersect with common 
feeding areas, and Berman-Kowalewski 
et al. (2010) state that southern 
California and off San Francisco is 
where most observed blue whale vessel 
strikes have occurred. NOAA annually 
issues voluntary VSR requests that are 
scheduled to be in effect May 1 to 
December 31 off San Francisco, 
Monterey, and Southern California 
within and near Greater Farallones, 
Cordell Bank, Monterey Bay, Chumash 
Heritage and Channel Islands national 
marine sanctuaries and in partnership 
with the Blue Whales Blue Skies 
program (note that in 2025, the 
Southern California VSR was extended 
in 2025 to cover Chumash Heritage 
NMS). Vessels transiting the area from 
May 1 through December 31, 2025 are 
recommended to exercise caution and 
voluntarily reduce speed to 10 kn (18.5 
km/hr) or less for blue, humpback, and 
fin whales. 
The Channel Islands NMS staff 
coordinates, collects, and monitors 
whale sightings in and around the VSR 
zones and the Channel Islands NMS 
region. The seasonally established 
Southern California VSR zone spans 
from Point Arguello to Dana Point, 
including the Traffic Separation 
Schemes in the Santa Barbara Channel 
and San Pedro Channel. Channel Island 
NMS observers collect information from 
aerial surveys conducted by NOAA, the 
U.S. Coast Guard, California Department 
of Fish and Game, and U.S. Navy 
chartered aircraft. Information on 
seasonal presence, movement, and 
general distribution patterns of large 
whales is shared with mariners, NMFS, 
U.S. Coast Guard, California Department 
of Fish and Game, the Santa Barbara 
Museum of Natural History, the Marine 
Exchange of Southern California, and 
whale scientists. Real time and 
historical whale observation data 
collected from multiple sources can be 
viewed on the Point Blue Whale 
Database. The Blue Whales Blue Skies 
program states that enrollment and 
cooperation rates from participating 
shipping lines have increased every year 
since the program began in 2014. The 
program further estimates that risk of 
fatal vessel strikes to endangered whales 
was reduced by approximately 50 
percent in 2024. As such, while vessel 
strike risk is not eliminated by these 
measures, the risk is significantly

scheme. 
The loss of a male would have far 
less, if any, effect on population rates 
and absent any information suggesting 
that one sex is more likely to be struck 
than another, we can reasonably assume 
that there is a 50 percent chance that 
each of the two authorized strikes 
would be a male, thereby further 
decreasing the likelihood of impacts on 
the population rate. In situations like 
this where potential M/SI is fractional, 
consideration must be given to the 
lessened impacts anticipated due to the 
likely absence of M/SI in 5 or 6 of the 
7 years and the fact that each of the 
strikes could be a male. 
Lastly, we reiterate that PBR is a 
conservative metric and also not 
sufficiently precise to serve as an 
absolute predictor of population effects 
upon which mortality caps would 
appropriately be based. As noted above, 
Wade et al. (1998), authors of the paper from which the current PBR equation is 
derived, note that ‘‘Estimating 
incidental mortality in 1 year to be 
greater than the PBR calculated from a 
single abundance survey does not prove 
the mortality will lead to depletion; it 
identifies a population worthy of careful 
future monitoring and possibly 
indicates that mortality-mitigation 
efforts should be initiated.’’ The 
information included here indicates that 
the current population trend of this blue 
whale stock is unknown but likely 
approaching carrying capacity and has 
leveled off because of density- 
dependence, not human-caused 
mortality, in spite of what might be 
otherwise indicated from the calculated 
PBR. Further, authorized M/SI is below 
10 percent of PBR and management 
actions are in place to minimize vessel 
strike from other vessel activity in one 
of the highest-risk areas for strikes. 
Based on the presence of the factors 
described above, we do not expect lethal 
take from Action Proponents’ activities, 
alone, to adversely affect Eastern North 
Pacific blue whales through effects on 
annual rates of recruitment or survival. 
Nonetheless, the fact that total human- 
caused mortality exceeds PBR 
necessitates close attention to the 
remainder of the impacts (i.e., 
harassment) on the Eastern North 
Pacific stock of blue whales from the 
Navy’s activities to ensure that the total 
authorized takes have a negligible 
impact on the species or stock. 
Therefore, this information will be 
considered in combination with our 
assessment of the impacts of authorized 
harassment takes in the Group and 
Species-Specific Analyses section that 
follows. 
Humpback Whale (Central America/ 
Southern Mexico—CA/OR/WA Stock) 
For humpback whales (Central 
America/Southern Mexico—CA/OR/WA 
stock), PBR is currently set at 3.5, the 
total annual M/SI is estimated at greater 
than or equal to 14.9, and the 2020 
NWTT final rule authorizes 0.29 takes 
by mortality annually, yielding a 
residual PBR of ¥11.69. NMFS is 
authorizing one M/SI for the Navy and 
one for the Coast Guard over the 7-year 
duration of the rule (two total; indicated 
as 0.29 annually for the purposes of 
comparing to PBR and evaluating 
overall effects on annual rates of 
recruitment and survival), which leaves 
a PBR remainder of ¥11.98. 
However, given that the negligible 
impact determination is based on the 
assessment of take of the activity being 
analyzed, when total annual mortality 
from human activities is higher, but the 
impacts from the specific activity being 
analyzed are very small, NMFS may still 
find the incremental impact of the 
authorized take from a specified activity 
is negligible even if total human-caused 
mortality exceeds PBR. Specifically, for 
example, if the authorized mortality is 
less than 10 percent of PBR and 
management measures are being taken 
to address serious injuries and 
mortalities from the other activities 
causing mortality (i.e., other than the specified activities covered by the ITA 
in consideration). When those 
considerations are applied here, the 
authorized lethal take (0.29 annually) of 
humpback whales from the Central 
America/Southern Mexico—CA/OR/WA 
stock is less than 10 percent of PBR 
(which is 3.5), and there are 
management measures in place to 
address M/SI from activities other than 
those the Action Proponents are 
conducting (as discussed below). 
Immediately below, we explain the 
information that supports our finding 
that the Action Proponents’ authorized 
M/SI is not expected to result in more 
than a negligible impact on this stock. 
As described previously, NMFS must 
also ensure that impacts by the 
applicant on the species or stock from 
other types of take (i.e., harassment) do not combine with the impacts from 
mortality to adversely affect the species 
or stock via impacts on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival, which occurs 
further below in the Group and Species- 
Specific Analyses section. 
Based on identical simulations as 
those conducted to identify Recovery 
Factors for PBR in Wade et al. (1998), 
but where values less than 0.1 were 
investigated (P. Wade, pers. comm.), we 
predict that where the mortality from a 
specified activity does not exceed N
min
 
* 
1
2Rmax * 0.013, the contemplated 
mortality for the specific activity will 
not delay the time to recovery by more 
than 1 percent. For this stock of 
humpback whales, N
min
* 
1
2Rmax * 
0.013 = 0.684. The annual mortality 
authorized is 0.29 (i.e., less than 0.684). This means that the mortality 
authorized in this rule for HCTT 
activities will not delay the time to 
recovery to OSP by more than 1 percent. 
The 2018 draft SAR and the more 
recent SARs rely on a new method to 
estimate annual deaths by vessel strike 
utilizing an encounter theory model that 
combined species distribution models of 
whale density, vessel traffic 
characteristics, and whale movement 
patterns obtained from satellite-tagged 
animals in the region to estimate 
encounters that would result in 
mortality (Rockwood et al., 2017). The 
model predicts 22 annual mortalities of 
humpback whales from vessel strikes, 
and the SAR attributes 6.45 of those 
strikes to the Central America/Southern 
Mexico—CA/OR/WA stock. With the 
additional M/SI of 8.1 from fisheries 
interactions, 0.35 from marine debris, 
recreational, and tribal fisheries, and 
0.29 from vessel strike authorized in the 
NWTT final rule, results in the current 
estimate of residual PBR being ¥11.69. 
Although NMFS’ Permits and 
Conservation Division in the Office of 
Protected Resources has independently 
reviewed the vessel strike model and its 
results and agrees that it is appropriate 
for estimating humpback whale 
mortality by vessel strike on the U.S. 
West Coast, for analytical purposes we 
also note that if the historical method 
were used to predict vessel strike (i.e., 
using observed mortality by vessel 
strike, or 0.6, instead of 18), then total 
human-caused mortality including the 
Action Proponents’ potential take would 
not exceed PBR. We further note that 
the authors (Rockwood et al., 2017) do 
not suggest that vessel strike suddenly 
increased to 22 recently. In fact, the 
model is not specific to a year, but 
rather offers a generalized prediction of 
vessel strike off the U.S. West Coast. 
Therefore, if the Rockwood et al. (2017) 
model is an accurate representation of 
vessel strike, then similar levels of 
vessel strike have been occurring in past 
years as well. Put another way, if the 
model is correct, for some number of 
years total-human-caused mortality has 
been significantly underestimated and 
PBR has been similarly exceeded by a 
notable amount, and yet, the Central 
America/Southern Mexico—CA/OR/WA 
stock of humpback whales is increasing 
nevertheless.

strike risk is not eliminated by these

reduced by this meaningful mitigation 
scheme. 
In addition to management measures 
for vessel strike, NMFS is in the process 
of developing a new Take Reduction

Stocks for Which Total Average Annual 
Mortality Is Not Known— 
Bottlenose Dolphin (O’ahu Stock) 
For bottlenose dolphin (O’ahu stock), 
PBR is currently set at 1. The total 
annual M/SI is unknown, and therefore 
a residual PBR cannot be calculated. 
NMFS is authorizing one M/SI over the 
7-year duration of the rule (indicated as 
0.14 annually for the purposes of 
comparing to PBR and evaluating 
overall effects on annual rates of 
recruitment and survival). 
Given that the negligible impact 
determination is based on the 
assessment of take of the activity being 
analyzed, even if total annual mortality 
from human activities is higher, but the 
impacts from the specific activity being 
analyzed are very small, NMFS may still 
find the incremental impact of the 
authorized take from a specified activity 
is to be negligible even if total human- 
caused mortality exceeds PBR. As such, 
the incremental impact of the 
authorized take from a specified activity 
may also be negligible where total 
annual M/SI is unknown. An unknown 
total annual M/SI is a cue to look more 
closely if and when the M/SI for the 
specified activity approaches PBR (e.g., 
consider whether there are mitigation 
measures in place for other potential 
sources of M/SI), as it becomes 
increasingly necessary (the closer the 
M/SI from the specified activity is to 
PBR) to carefully consider whether there 
are other factors that could affect 
reproduction or survival. Here, the 
authorized M/SI is 0.14 annually, which 
does not closely approach PBR (PBR is 
1.0), there are management measures in 
place to address M/SI from activities 
other than those the Action Proponents 
are conducting (as discussed below), 
and there are no other factors that 
would suggest that the authorized 
mortality (alone) would have more than 
a negligible impact on this stock. 
Immediately below, we explain the

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258975 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations cause mortality and serious injury to 
marine mammals in other U.S. fisheries, 
including gillnets and hook-and-line, 
and mortality reports indicate that 
nearshore fisheries are a risk for 
bottlenose dolphins in Hawaii. 
However, gillnetting around Maui and 
much of O’ahu is banned by state 
regulation, and in areas where 
gillnetting is permitted, fishermen are 
required to monitor their gillnets for 
bycatch every 30 minutes. 
In this case, 0.14 M/SI means one 
mortality in 1 of the 7 years and zero 
mortalities in 6 of those 7 years. 
Therefore, the Action Proponents would 
not be contributing to the total human- 
caused mortality at all in 6 of the 7, or 
85.7 percent, of the years covered by 
this rulemaking. That means that even 
if an O’ahu bottlenose dolphin were to 
be lethally taken from explosives, in 6 
of the 7 years, there could be no effect 
on annual rates of recruitment or 
survival from Navy-caused M/SI. 
Additionally, the loss of a male would 
have far less, if any, effect on population 
rates and absent any information 
suggesting that one sex is more likely to 
be struck than another, we can 
reasonably assume that there is a 50 
percent chance that the single mortality 
authorized by this rulemaking would be 
a male, thereby further decreasing the 
likelihood of impacts on the population 
rate. In situations like this where 
potential M/SI is fractional, 
consideration must be given to the 
lessened impacts anticipated due to the 
absence of M/SI in 6 of the 7 years and 
the fact that the single mortality could 
be a male. Lastly, we reiterate that PBR 
is a conservative metric and also not 
sufficiently precise to serve as an 
absolute predictor of population effects 
upon which mortality caps would 
appropriately be based. This is 
especially important given the minor 
difference between zero and one across 
the 7-year period covered by this 
rulemaking, which is the smallest 
distinction possible when considering 
mortality. As noted above, Wade et al. 
(1998), authors of the paper from which 
the current PBR equation is derived, 
note that ‘‘Estimating incidental 
mortality in 1 year to be greater than the 
PBR calculated from a single abundance 
survey does not prove the mortality will 
lead to depletion; it identifies a 
population worthy of careful future 
monitoring and possibly indicates that 
mortality-mitigation efforts should be 
initiated.’’ Further, management actions 
are in place that minimize fishery 
interactions. Based on the presence of 
the factors described above, we do not 
expect lethal take from the Action 
Proponents’ activities, alone, to 
adversely affect O’ahu bottlenose 
dolphins through effects on annual rates 
of recruitment or survival. Nonetheless, 
the fact that total human-caused 
mortality is unknown, and PBR is low, 
necessitates close attention to the 
remainder of the impacts (i.e., 
harassment) on the O’ahu stock of 
bottlenose dolphins from the Action 
Proponents’ activities to ensure that the 
total authorized takes have a negligible 
impact on the species or stock. 
Therefore, this information will be 
considered in combination with our 
assessment of the impacts of authorized 
harassment takes in the Group and 
Species-Specific Analyses section that 
follows. 
Stocks for Which PBR Is Unknown— 
Pantropical Spotted Dolphin (Baja 
California Peninsula Mexico 
Population) 
The Baja California Peninsula Mexico 
population of pantropical spotted 
dolphins are not a NMFS-managed 
stock, and therefore, PBR and annual M/ 
SI metrics are not available. NMFS is 
authorizing two M/SIs over the 7-year 
duration of the rule (indicated as 0.29 
annually for the purposes of evaluating 
overall effects on annual rates of 
recruitment and survival). 
Immediately below, we explain the 
information that supports our finding 
that the Action Proponents’ authorized 
M/SI is not expected to result in more 
than a negligible impact on this stock. 
As described previously, NMFS must 
also ensure that impacts by the 
applicant on the species or stock from 
other types of take (i.e., harassment) do not combine with the impacts from 
mortality to adversely affect the species 
or stock via impacts on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival, which occurs 
further below in the Group and Species- 
Specific Analyses section. 
Given that this is not a NMFS- 
managed stock, some metrics are not 
available for this population, including 
PBR. PBR values are calculated by 
NMFS as the level of annual removal 
from a stock that will allow that stock 
to equilibrate within OSP at least 95 
percent of the time, and is the product 
of factors relating to the minimum 
population estimate of the stock (N
min
), 
the productivity rate of the stock at a 
small population size, and a recovery 
factor. The productivity rate is 
estimated as one-half of the estimated or 
theoretical maximum rate of population 
growth for the stock if it were small. In 
this case, NMFS estimates the 
productivity rate to be one half the 
default maximum net growth rate for 
cetaceans (
1
2of 4 percent). Recovery 
factors range from 0.1 to 1, with smaller 
factors applied to more at-risk species. 
Given the unknowns of this population, 
NMFS used 0.1. N
min
is not available, 
and therefore, NMFS relies on the 
NMSDD abundance estimate of 70,889 
to estimate PBR. As such, using the 
NMSDD abundance estimate, PBR is 
estimated to be 141.78 (70,889 × (0.5 × 4 percent) × (0.1)). Of note, if PBR was calculated using an estimated N
min
of 
half of the NMSDD abundance estimate 
(35,445), PBR would be 70.89. 
Given that the negligible impact 
determination is based on the 
assessment of take of the activity being 
analyzed, even if total annual mortality 
from human activities is higher, but the 
impacts from the specific activity being 
analyzed are very small, NMFS may still 
find the incremental impact of the 
authorized take from a specified activity 
is to be negligible even if total human- 
caused mortality exceeds PBR. As such, 
the incremental impact of the 
authorized take from a specified activity 
may also be negligible where total 
annual M/SI is unknown. An unknown 
total annual M/SI is a cue to look more 
closely if and when the M/SI for the 
specified activity approaches PBR (e.g., 
consider whether there are mitigation 
measures in place for other potential 
sources of M/SI), as it becomes 
increasingly necessary (the closer the 
M/SI from the specified activity is to 
PBR) to carefully consider whether there 
are other factors that could affect 
reproduction or survival. Here, the 
authorized M/SI is 0.29 annually, which 
does not closely approach our PBR 
estimate above (PBR is estimated as 
141.78, potentially as low as 70.89), and 
there are no other factors that would 
suggest that the authorized mortality 
(alone) would have more than a 
negligible impact on this stock. 
Immediately below, we explain the 
information that supports our finding 
that the Action Proponents’ authorized 
M/SI is not expected to result in more 
than a negligible impact on this stock. 
As described previously, NMFS must 
also ensure that impacts by the 
applicant on the species or stock from 
other types of take (i.e., harassment) do not combine with the impacts from 
mortality to adversely affect the species 
or stock via impacts on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival, which occurs

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258976 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations any single mortality authorized by this 
rulemaking would be a male, thereby 
further decreasing the likelihood of 
impacts on the population rate. In 
situations like this where potential M/ 
SI is fractional, consideration must be 
given to the lessened impacts 
anticipated due to the absence of M/SI 
in 5 or 6 of the 7 years and the fact that 
any single mortality could be a male. 
Based on the presence of the factors 
described above, we do not expect lethal 
take from the Action Proponents’ 
activities, alone, to adversely affect the 
Baja California Peninsula Mexico 
population of pantropical spotted 
dolphins through effects on annual rates 
of recruitment or survival. Nonetheless, 
the fact that total human-caused 
mortality is unknown necessitates close 
attention to the remainder of the 
impacts (i.e., harassment) on the Baja California Peninsula Mexico population 
of pantropical spotted dolphins from the 
Action Proponents’ activities to ensure 
that the total authorized takes have a 
negligible impact on the species or 
stock. Therefore, this information will 
be considered in combination with our 
assessment of the impacts of authorized 
harassment takes in the Group and 
Species-Specific Analyses section that 
follows. 
Group and Species-Specific Analyses 
In this section, we build on the 
general analysis that applies to all 
marine mammals in the HCTT Study 
Area from the previous sections. We 
first include information and analysis 
that applies to mysticetes or, separately, 
odontocetes or pinnipeds, and then 
within those three sections, more 
specific information that applies to 
smaller groups, where applicable, and 
the affected species or stocks. The 
specific authorized take numbers are 
also included in the analyses below, so 
here we provide some additional 
context and discussion regarding how 
we consider the authorized take 
numbers in those analyses. 
The maximum amount and type of 
incidental take of marine mammals 
reasonably likely to occur and therefore 
authorized from exposures to sonar and 
other active acoustic sources and 
explosions during the 7-year activity 
period are shown in table 3, table 4, 
table 5, and table 6, and the subset 
attributable to ship shock trials is 
included in table 15. 
In the discussions below, the 
estimated takes by Level B harassment 
represent instances of take, not the 
number of individuals taken (the much 
lower and less frequent Level A 
harassment takes are far more likely to 
be associated with separate individuals), 
and in some cases individuals may be 
taken more than one time. As part of our 
evaluation of the magnitude and 
severity of impacts to marine mammal 
individuals and the species, and 
specifically in an effort to better 
understand the degree to which the 
modeled and estimated takes likely 
represent repeated takes of the 
individuals of a given species/stock, we 
consider the total annual numbers of 
take by harassment (auditory injury, 
non-auditory injury, TTS, and 
behavioral disturbance) for species or 
stocks as compared to their associated 
abundance estimates—specifically, take 
numbers higher than the stock 
abundance clearly indicate that some 
number of individuals are being taken 
on more than 1 day in the year, and 
broadly higher or lower ratios of take to 
abundance may reasonably be 
considered to equate to higher or lower 
likelihood of repeated takes, 
respectively, other potentially 
influencing factors being equal. In 
addition to the mathematical 
consideration of estimated take 
compared to abundance, we also 
consider other factors or circumstances 
that may influence the likelihood of 
repeated takes, where known, such as 
circumstances where activities resulting 
in take are focused in an area and time 
(e.g., instrumented ranges or a homeport, or long-duration activities 
such as MTEs) and/or where the same 
individual marine mammals are known 
to congregate over longer periods of 
time (e.g., pinnipeds at a haulout, mysticetes in a known foraging area, or 
resident odontocetes with smaller home 
ranges). Similarly, and all else being 
equal, estimated takes that are largely 
focused in one region and/or season (see 
appendix A of the application and table 
54, table 56, table 58, table 60, table 62, 
and table 64 of this final rule) may 
indicate a higher likelihood of repeated 
takes of the same individuals. 
Occasional, milder behavioral 
responses are unlikely to cause long- 
term consequences for individual 
animals or populations, and even if 
some smaller subset of the takes are in 
the form of a longer (several hours or a 
day) and more severe response, if they 
are not expected to be repeated over a 
comparatively longer duration of 
sequential days, impacts to individual 
fitness are not anticipated. Nearly all 
studies and experts agree that infrequent 
exposures of a single day or less are 
unlikely to impact an individual’s 
overall energy budget (Farmer et al., 
2018b; Harris et al., 2018; King et al., 
2015; NAS, 2017; New et al., 2014; 
Southall et al., 2007; Villegas-Amtmann et al., 2015; Hoekendijk et al., 2018; 
Wisniewska et al., 2018; Czapanskiy et al., 2021; Pirotta, 2022). Generally speaking, and in the case of most 
species impacted by the planned 
activities, in the cases where some 
number of individuals may reasonably 
be expected to be taken on more than 1 
day within a year, that number of days 
would be comparatively small and also 
with no reason to expect that those takes 
would occur on sequential days. In the 
rarer cases of species where individuals 
might be expected to be taken on a 
comparatively higher number of days of 
the year and there are reasons to think 
that these days might be sequential or 
clumped together, the likely impacts of 
this situation are discussed explicitly in 
the species discussions. 
To assist in understanding what this 
analysis means, we clarify a few issues 
related to estimated takes and the 
analysis here. An individual that incurs 
AUD INJ or TTS may sometimes, for 
example, also be subject to behavioral 
disturbance at the same time. As 
described above in this section, the 
degree of auditory injury, and the degree 
and duration of TTS, expected to be 
incurred from the Navy’s activities are 
not expected to impact marine 
mammals such that their reproduction 
or survival could be affected. Similarly, 
data do not suggest that a single 
instance in which an animal accrues 
auditory injury or TTS and is also 
subjected to behavioral disturbance 
would result in impacts to reproduction 
or survival. Alternately, we recognize 
that if an individual is subjected to 
behavioral disturbance repeatedly for a 
longer duration and on consecutive 
days, effects could accrue to the point 
that reproductive success is impacted. 
Accordingly, in analyzing the number of 
takes and the likelihood of repeated and 
sequential takes, we consider the total 
takes, not just the takes by Level B 
harassment by behavioral disturbance, 
so that individuals potentially exposed 
to both threshold shift and behavioral 
disturbance are appropriately 
considered. The number of takes by 
Level A harassment by auditory injury 
are so low (and zero in some cases) 
compared to abundance numbers that it 
is considered highly unlikely that any 
individual would be taken at those 
levels more than once. 
Use of sonar and other transducers 
would typically be transient and 
temporary. The majority of acoustic 
effects to most marine mammal stocks 
from sonar and other active sound 
sources during the specified military 
readiness activities would be primarily 
from anti-submarine warfare events. On 
the less severe end, exposure to

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258977 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations comparatively lower levels of sound at 
a detectably greater distance from the 
animal, for a few or several minutes, 
could result in a behavioral response 
such as avoiding an area that an animal 
would otherwise have moved through or 
fed in, or breaking off one or a few 
feeding bouts. More severe behavioral 
effects could occur when an animal gets 
close enough to the source to receive a 
comparatively higher level of sound, is 
exposed continuously to one source for 
a longer time, or is exposed 
intermittently to different sources 
throughout a day. Such effects might 
result in an animal having a more severe 
flight response and leaving a larger area 
for a day or more or potentially losing 
feeding opportunities for a day. 
However, such severe behavioral effects 
are expected to occur infrequently. In 
addition to the proximity to the source, 
the type of activity and the season and 
location during which an animal is 
exposed can inform the impacts. These 
factors, including the numbers and 
types of effects that are estimated in 
areas known to be biologically 
important for certain species are 
discussed in the group and species- 
specific sections, below. 
As described in the Mitigation 
Measures section, this rule includes 
mitigation measures that would reduce 
the probability and/or severity of 
impacts expected to result from acute 
exposure to acoustic sources or 
explosives, vessel strike, and impacts to 
marine mammal habitat. Specifically, 
the Action Proponents will use a 
combination of delayed starts, 
powerdowns, and shutdowns to avoid 
mortality or serious injury, minimize 
the likelihood or severity of AUD INJ or 
non-auditory injury, and reduce 
instances of TTS or more severe 
behavioral disturbance caused by 
acoustic sources or explosives. The 
Action Proponents will also implement 
multiple time/area restrictions that 
would reduce take of marine mammals 
in areas or at times where they are 
known to engage in important 
behaviors, such as calving, where the 
disruption of those behaviors would 
have a higher probability of resulting in 
impacts on reproduction or survival of 
individuals that could lead to 
population-level impacts. 
These time/area restrictions include a 
Hawaii Island Marine Mammal 
Mitigation Area, a Hawaii 4-Islands 
Marine Mammal Mitigation Area, 
Northern California Large Whale 
Mitigation Area, Central California 
Large Whale Mitigation Area, Southern 
California Blue Whale Mitigation Area, 
California Large Whale Real-Time 
Notification Mitigation Area, and San 
Nicolas Island Pinniped Haulout 
Mitigation Area as well as Hawaii 
Humpback Whale Awareness Messages 
and California Large Whale Awareness 
Messages. The Southern California Blue 
Whale Mitigation Area is discussed in 
the blue whale section below. However, 
it is important to note that measures in 
that area, while developed to protect 
blue whales, would also benefit other 
marine mammals in those areas. 
Within the Hawaii Island Marine 
Mammal Mitigation Area, the Action 
Proponents must not use more than 300 
combined hours of MF1 and MF1C 
surface ship hull-mounted MFAS or 20 
hours of helicopter dipping sonar (a 
MFAS source) annually and must not 
detonate in-water explosives (including 
underwater explosives and explosives 
deployed against surface targets). 
Mitigation in this area is designed to 
reduce exposure of numerous small and 
resident marine mammal populations 
(including Blainville’s beaked whales, 
bottlenose dolphins, goose-beaked 
whales, dwarf sperm whales, false killer 
whales, melon-headed whales, 
pantropical spotted dolphins, pygmy 
killer whales, rough-toothed dolphins, 
short-finned pilot whales, and spinner 
dolphins), humpback whales within 
important seasonal reproductive habitat, 
and Hawaiian monk seals within critical 
habitat, to levels of sound that have the 
potential to cause injurious or 
behavioral impacts. 
Within the Hawaii 4-Islands Marine 
Mammal Mitigation Area, from 
November 15 through April 15, the 
Action Proponents must not use MF1 
and MF1C surface ship hull-mounted 
MFAS. The Action Proponents must not 
detonate in-water explosives (including 
underwater explosives and explosives 
deployed against surface targets) within 
the mitigation area (year-round). This 
mitigation will prevent exposure of 
humpback whales in high-density 
seasonal reproductive habitats (e.g., 
north of Maui and Moloka1i), Main 
Hawaiian Islands insular false killer 
whales in high seasonal occurrence 
areas, and numerous small and resident 
marine mammal populations that occur 
year-round (including bottlenose 
dolphins, pantropical spotted dolphins, 
and spinner dolphins, and Hawaiian 
monk seals) to explosives that have the 
potential to cause injury, mortality, or 
behavioral disturbance, and will 
minimize exposure of humpback whales 
in high-density seasonal reproductive 
habitats (e.g., north of Maui and Moloka1i) and Main Hawaiian Islands 
insular false killer whales in high 
seasonal occurrence areas to levels of 
sound that have the potential to cause 
injurious or behavioral impacts. 
Within the Northern California Large 
Whale Mitigation Area, Central 
California Large Whale Mitigation Area, 
and Southern California Blue Whale 
Mitigation Area, from June 1 through 
October 31, the Action Proponents must 
not use more than 300 combined hours 
of MF1 and MF1C surface ship hull- 
mounted MFAS (excluding normal 
maintenance and systems checks) total 
during training and testing within these 
three areas. This measure will reduce 
exposure of blue whales, fin whales, 
gray whales, and humpback whales in 
important seasonal foraging, migratory, 
and calving habitats to levels of sound 
that have the potential to cause 
injurious or behavioral impacts. 
Additionally, during the same June 1– 
October 31 period, within the portion of 
the mitigation area off San Diego, the 
Action Proponents must not detonate 
in-water explosives (including 
underwater explosives and explosives 
deployed against surface targets) during 
large-caliber (57 mm (2.24 in)) 
gunnery, torpedo, bombing, and missile 
(including 2.75-in (7 cm) rockets) 
training and testing. This measure will 
reduce exposure of large whales within 
important seasonal foraging habitats to 
explosives that have the potential to 
cause injury, mortality, or behavioral 
disturbance. 
Within the California Large Whale 
Real-Time Notification Mitigation Area, 
for each instance an aggregation of large 
whales (three or more whales within 1 
nmi (1.9 km)) is sighted in the area 
between 32 and 33 degrees North and 
117.2 and 119.5 degrees West, Action 
Proponent surface vessels must report 
the sightings to other Action Proponent 
vessels in the vicinity. Reported 
sightings will be made as soon as 
operationally and safely feasible. 
Lookouts must use the information from 
the real-time notifications to inform 
their visual observations of applicable 
mitigation zones. The real-time 
notification area encompasses the 
locations of recent (2021 through 2025) 
military vessel strikes, and historic 
strikes where precise latitude and 
longitude were known. Timely 
information regarding an aggregation of 
whales in a particular location may 
result in an increased awareness of 
vessel strike risk by Lookouts and vessel 
operators. 
Within the San Nicolas Island 
Pinniped Haulout Mitigation Area, Navy 
personnel must implement multiple 
measures that would minimize in-air 
launch noise and physical disturbance 
to pinnipeds hauled out on beaches, as 
well as to continue assessing baseline 
pinniped distribution/abundance and

Last, the Hawaii Humpback Whale 
Awareness Messages and California 
Large Whale Awareness Messages will 
alert applicable assets (and their 
Lookouts) transiting and training or 
testing in the Hawaii Range Complex or 
on the U.S. West Coast to the possible 
presence of concentrations of large 
whales during certain periods of the 
year. Lookouts must use that knowledge 
to help inform their visual observations 
during military readiness activities that 
involve vessel movements, active sonar, 
in-water explosives (including 
underwater explosives and explosives 
deployed against surface targets), or the 
deployment of non-explosive ordnance 
against surface targets in the mitigation 
area. These messages will minimize 
potential large whale vessel interactions 
and exposure to acoustic, explosive, and 
physical disturbance and strike stressors 
that have the potential to cause 
mortality, injury, or behavioral 
disturbance during reproductive 
seasons, foraging and migration seasons, 
and to resident whales. 
In addition to the nature and context 
of the disturbance, including whether 
take occurs in a known BIA, species- 
specific factors affect the severity of 
impacts to individual animals and 
population consequences of 
disturbance. Keen et al. (2021) identifies 
three population consequences of 
disturbance themes: life history traits, 
environmental conditions, and 
disturbance source characteristics. Life 
history traits considered in Keen et al. 
(2021) include movement ecology 
(whether animals are resident, nomadic, 
or migratory), reproductive strategy 
(capital breeders, income breeders, or 
mixed), body size (based on size and life 
stage), and pace of life (slow or fast). 
Regarding movement ecology, 
resident animals that have small home 
ranges relative to the size and duration 
of an impact zone have a higher risk of 
repeated exposures to an ongoing 
activity. Animals that are nomadic over 
a larger range may have less predictable 
risk of repeated exposure. For resident 
and nomadic populations, overlap of a 
stressor with feeding or reproduction 
depends more on time of year rather 
than location in their habitat range. In 
contrast, migratory animals may have 
higher or reduced potential for exposure 
during feeding and reproduction based 
on both location, time of the year, and 
duration of an activity. The risk of 
repeated exposure during individual 
events may be lower during migration as 
animals maintain directed transit 
through an area. 
Reproduction is energetically 
expensive for female marine mammals, 
and reproductive strategy can influence 
an animal’s sensitivity to disturbance. 
Mysticetes and phocids are generally 
capital breeders. Capital breeders rely 
on their capital, or energy stores, to 
migrate, maintain pregnancy, and nurse 
a calf. Capital breeders would be more 
resilient to short-term foraging 
disruption due to their reliance on built- 
up energy reserves but are vulnerable to 
prolonged foraging impacts during 
gestation. Otariids and most odontocetes 
are income breeders, which rely on 
some level of income, or regular 
foraging, to give birth and nurse a calf. 
Income breeders would be more 
sensitive to the consequences of 
disturbances that impact foraging during 
lactation. Some species exhibit traits of 
both, such as beaked whales. 
Smaller animals require more food 
intake per unit body mass than large 
animals. They must consume food on a 
regular basis and are likely to be non- 
migratory and income breeders. The 
smallest odontocetes, the porpoises, 
must maintain high metabolisms to 
maintain thermoregulation and cannot 
rely on blubber stores for long periods 
of time, whereas larger odontocetes can 
more easily thermoregulate. The larger 
size of other odontocetes is an 
adaptation for deep diving that allows 
them to access high quality mesopelagic 
and bathypelagic prey. Both small and 
large odontocetes have lower foraging 
efficiency than the large whales. The 
filter-feeding large whales (mysticetes) 
consume most of their food within 
several months of the year and rely on 
extensive lipid reserves for the 
remainder of the year. The metabolism 
of mysticetes allows for fasting while 
seeking prey patches during foraging 
season and prolonged periods of fasting 
outside of foraging season (Goldbogen et 
al., 2023). Their energy stores support capital breeding and long migrations. 
The effect of a temporary feeding 
disturbance is likely to have 
inconsequential impacts to a mysticete, 
but may be consequential for small 
cetaceans. Despite their relatively 
smaller size, amphibious pinnipeds 
have lower thermoregulatory 
requirements because they spend a 
portion of time on land. For purposes of 
this assessment, marine mammals were 
generally categorized as small (less than 
10 ft (3.05 m)), medium (10–30 ft (3.05– 
9.1 m)), or large (more than 30 ft (9.1 m)) 
based on length. 
Populations with a fast pace of life are 
characterized by early age of maturity, 
high birth rates, and short life spans, 
whereas populations with a slow pace 
of life are characterized by later age of 
maturity, low birth rates, and long life 
spans. The consequences of disturbance 
in these populations differ. Although 
reproduction in populations with a fast 
pace of life is more sensitive to foraging 
disruption, these populations are quick 
to recover. Reproduction in populations 
with a slow pace of life is resilient to 
foraging disruption, but late maturity 
and low birth rates mean that long-term 
impacts to breeding adults have a 
longer-term effect on population growth 
rates. Pace of life was categorized for 
each species in this analysis by 
comparing age at sexual maturity, birth 
rate interval, life span, body size, and 
feeding and reproductive strategy. 
Southall et al. (2023) also identified factors that inform a population’s 
vulnerability. The authors describe a 
framework to assess risk to populations 
from specific industry impact scenarios 
at different locations or times of year. 
While this approach may not be suitable 
for many military readiness activities, 
for which alternate spatial or seasonal 
scenarios are not usually feasible, the 
concepts considered in that framework’s 
population vulnerability assessment are 
useful in this analysis, including 
population status (e.g., endangered or threatened), population trend (i.e., 
decreasing, stable, or increasing), 
population size, and chronic exposure 
to other anthropogenic or environmental 
stressors (e.g., fisheries interactions, pollution). These factors are also 
considered when assessing the overall 
vulnerability of a stock to repeated 
effects from acoustic and explosive 
stressors. 
In consideration of the factors 
outlined above, if impacts to individuals 
increase in magnitude or severity such 
that repeated and sequential higher 
severity impacts occur (the probability 
of this goes up for an individual the 
higher total number of takes it has) or 
the total number of moderate to more 
severe impacts increases substantially, 
especially if occurring across sequential 
days, then it becomes more likely that 
the aggregate effects could potentially 
interfere with feeding enough to reduce 
energy budgets in a manner that could 
impact reproductive success via longer 
cow-calf intervals, terminated 
pregnancies, or calf mortality. It is 
important to note that these impacts 
accrue exclusively to females, which 
comprise only approximately 50 percent 
of the population. Based on energetic 
models, it takes energetic impacts of a 
significantly greater magnitude to cause 
the death of an adult marine mammal, 
and females will always terminate a 
pregnancy or stop lactating before 
allowing their health to deteriorate. 
Also, the death of an adult female has

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258979 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations significantly more impact on population 
growth rates than reductions in 
reproductive success, while the death of 
an adult male has very little effect on 
population growth rates. However, as 
explained earlier, such severe impacts 
from the specified activities would be 
very infrequent and not considered 
likely to occur at all for most species 
and stocks. We note that the negligible 
impact analysis is inherently a two- 
tiered assessment that first evaluates the 
anticipated impacts of the activities on 
marine mammals individuals, and then 
if impacts are expected to reproduction 
or survival of any individuals further 
evaluates the effects of those individual 
impacts on rates of reproduction and 
survival of the species or stock, in the 
context of the status of the species or 
stock. The analyses below in some cases 
address species collectively if they 
occupy the same functional hearing 
group (i.e., very-low, low, high, and very high-frequency cetaceans), share 
similar life history strategies, and/or are 
known to behaviorally respond 
similarly to acoustic stressors. Because 
some of these groups or species share 
characteristics that inform the impact 
analysis similarly, it would be 
duplicative to repeat the same analysis 
for each species. In addition, similar 
species typically have the same hearing 
capabilities and behaviorally respond in 
the same manner. 
Thus, our analysis below considers 
the effects of the specified activities on 
each affected species or stock even 
where discussion is organized by 
functional hearing group and/or 
information is evaluated at the group 
level. Where there are meaningful 
differences between a species or stock 
that would further differentiate the 
analysis, they are described either 
within the section or included as a 
separate part of each section. 
Specifically, below, we first give broad 
descriptions of the mysticete, 
odontocete, and pinniped groups and 
then differentiate them further into 
groups as appropriate. 
Mysticetes 
This section builds on the broader 
discussion above and brings together the 
discussion of the different types and 
amounts of take that different stocks 
will incur, the applicable mitigation for 
each stock, and the status and life 
history of the stocks to support the 
negligible impact determinations for 
each stock. We have already described 
above why we believe the incremental 
addition of the limited number of low- 
level auditory injury takes will not have 
any meaningful effect towards 
inhibiting reproduction or survival. We 
have also described in this section 
above the unlikelihood of any masking 
or habitat impacts having effects that 
would impact the reproduction or 
survival of any of the individual marine 
mammals affected by the Action 
Proponents’ activities. For mysticetes, 
there is no predicted non-auditory 
injury from explosives for any stocks 
except the CA/OR/WA stock of fin 
whale and the Mainland Mexico—CA/ 
OR/WA stock of humpback whale. 
Regarding the severity of individual 
takes by Level B harassment by 
behavioral disturbance for mysticetes, 
the majority of these responses are 
anticipated to occur at received levels 
below 172 dB, and last from a few 
minutes to a few hours, at most, with 
associated responses most likely in the 
form of moving away from the source, 
foraging interruptions, vocalization 
changes, or disruption of other social 
behaviors, lasting from a few minutes to 
several hours. Much of the discussion 
below focuses on the behavioral effects 
and the mitigation measures that reduce 
the probability or severity of effects in 
biologically important areas or other 
habitat. Because there are multiple 
stock-specific factors in relation to the 
status of the species, as well as mortality 
take arising from vessel strike for several 
stocks, at the end of the section we 
break out stock-specific findings. 
In table 54 below for mysticetes, we 
indicate the total annual mortality, 
Level A harassment, and Level B 
harassment, and the maximum annual 
harassment as a percentage of stock 
abundance. 
In table 55 below, we indicate the 
status, life history traits, important 
habitats, and threats that inform our 
analysis of the potential impacts of the 
estimated take on the affected mysticete 
stocks.

Gray Whale (Eastern North Pacific and 
Western North Pacific Stocks)— 
Gray whales from the Eastern North 
Pacific stock are not listed under the 
ESA and are not considered as depleted 
or strategic under the MMPA, while 
gray whales from the Western North 
Pacific stock are listed as endangered 
under the ESA and depleted and 
strategic under the MMPA. Both stocks 
are migratory and most likely to be in 
the California Study Area during their 
migrations from winter to spring within 
10 km (5.4 nmi) of the coast. Some gray 
whales transit further offshore in 
Southern California when making 
straight line transits south of Point 
Conception to and from Mexico. Gray 
whales face several chronic 
anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic 
risk factors, including vessel strikes, 
fisheries interactions, habitat 
degradation, pollution, vessel 
disturbance, ocean noise, and 
subsistence hunting, among others. 
The current stock abundance estimate 
of the Eastern North Pacific stock of gray 
whale is 26,960 animals. However, 
recent (2024–2025) surveys conducted 
by NMFS’ SWFSC estimated that the 
population has declined since the most 
recent Eastern North Pacific gray whale 
SAR was published, and estimates an 
abundance of 12,950 whales (Eguchi et 
al., 2025). The Western North Pacific stock abundance is 290 animals. There 
are no UMEs or other factors that cause 
particular concern for these stocks. As 
described in the Description of Marine 
Mammals and Their Habitat in the Area 
of the Specified Activities section, the 
HCTT Study Area overlaps eight BIAs 
for the Eastern North Pacific stock, 
including three feeding, four migratory, 
and one reproductive for the nearshore 
migratory corridor used by cow/calf 
pairs. As shown in table 54, the 
maximum annual allowable instances of 
take under this rule by Level A and 
Level B harassment are 167 and 16,711, 
respectively. As indicated, the rule also 
allows for up to three takes by serious 
injury or mortality over the course of the 
7-year rule, the impacts of which are 
discussed above in the Serious Injury 
and Mortality section. 
There are no known biologically 
important areas for the Western North 
Pacific stock of gray whale in the HCTT 
Study Area, though the Western North 
Pacific stock may use the same 
migratory areas as the Eastern North 
Pacific stock while migrating to 
wintering areas in Mexico 
(Calambokidis et al., 2024). As shown in table 54, the maximum annual 
allowable instances of take under this 
rule by Level A and Level B harassment 
are 2 and 169, respectively. No mortality 
is anticipated or authorized, nor is any 
non-auditory injury. The total take 
allowable across all 7 years of the rule 
is indicated in table 19. 
Regarding the potential takes 
associated with auditory impairment, as 
described in the Auditory Injury from 
Sonar Acoustic Sources and Explosives 
and Non-Auditory Injury from 
Explosives section above, any takes in 
the form of TTS are expected to be 
lower-level, of short duration (from 
minutes to, at most, several hours or less 
than a day), and mostly not in a 
frequency band that would be expected 
to interfere with gray whale 
communication or other important low- 
frequency cues. Any associated lost 
opportunities or capabilities individuals 
might experience as a result of TTS 
would not be at a level or duration that 
would be expected to impact 
reproductive success or survival. For 
similar reasons, while auditory injury 
impacts last longer, the low anticipated 
levels of AUD INJ that could be 
reasonably expected to result from these 
activities are unlikely to have any effect 
on fitness. 
Regarding the likely severity of any 
single instance of take by behavioral 
disturbance, as described above, the 
majority of the predicted exposures are 
expected to be below 172 dB SPL and 
last from a few minutes to a few hours, 
at most, with associated responses most 
likely in the form of moving away from 
the source, foraging interruptions, 
vocalization changes, or disruption of 
other social behaviors, lasting from a 
few minutes to several hours. Gray 
whales are large-bodied capital breeders 
with a slow pace of life and are 
therefore generally less susceptible to 
impacts from shorter duration foraging 
disruptions. Further, as described in the 
Group and Species-Specific Analyses 
section above and the Mitigation 
Measures section, mitigation measures 
are expected to further reduce the 
potential severity of impacts through 
real-time operational measures that 
minimize higher level/longer duration 
exposures and time/area measures that 
reduce impacts in high value habitat. 
As described above, in addition to 
evaluating the anticipated impacts of 
the single instances of takes, it is 
important to understand the degree to 
which individual marine mammals may 
be disturbed repeatedly across multiple 
days of the year. In this case, given the 
number of takes by harassment as 
compared to the stock/species 
abundance (see table 54), and the fact 
that a portion of the takes of the Eastern 
North Pacific occur in BIAs, it is likely 
that some portion of the individuals 
taken are taken repeatedly over a 
limited number of days. However, given 
the variety of activity types that 
contribute to take across separate 
exercises conducted at different times 
and in different areas, and the fact that 
many result from transient activities 
conducted at sea, it is unlikely that 
repeated takes would occur either in 
numbers across sequential days in a 
manner likely to impact foraging 
success and energetics or other 
behaviors such that reproduction or 
survival of any individuals is likely to 
be impacted. 
Given the magnitude and severity of 
the impacts discussed above to the 
Western North Pacific stock 
(considering annual take maxima and 
the total across 7 years) and their 
habitat, and in consideration of the 
required mitigation measures and other 
information presented, the Action 
Proponents’ activities are unlikely to 
result in impacts on the reproduction or 
survival of any individuals and, 
therefore, unlikely to affect annual rates 
of recruitment or survival. For the 
Eastern North Pacific stock, as analyzed 
and described in the Serious Injury and 
Mortality section, given the status of the 
stock and in consideration of other 
ongoing anthropogenic mortality 
(fisheries interactions, vessel strike), the 
authorized M/SI (three over the course 
of the 7-year rule, or 0.43 annually) will 
not, alone, nor in combination with the 
impacts of the take by harassment 
discussed above (which is not expected 
to impact the reproduction or survival 
of any individuals), be expected to 
adversely affect rates of recruitment and 
survival for any of this stock. For these 
reasons, we have determined that the 
total take (considering annual maxima 
and across 7 years) anticipated and 
authorized will have a negligible impact 
on the Eastern North Pacific and 
Western North Pacific stocks of gray 
whale. 
Blue Whale (Central North Pacific and 
Eastern North Pacific Stocks)— 
Blue whales are listed as endangered 
under the ESA and as both depleted and 
strategic under the MMPA. Both stocks 
of blue whales are migratory 
populations that can occur near the 
coast, over the continental shelf, and in 
oceanic waters. Blue whales face several 
chronic anthropogenic and non- 
anthropogenic risk factors, including 
vessel strike, fisheries interactions, 
habitat degradation, pollution, vessel 
disturbance, and ocean noise, among 
others.

stock abundance as 3,233. The Central 
North Pacific stock’s primary range is 
outside of the HCTT Study Area. There 
are no UMEs or other factors that cause 
particular concern for this stock, and 
there are no known biologically 
important areas for the Central North 
Pacific stock of blue whales in the 
HCTT Study Area. This stock migrates 
from their feeding grounds in the Gulf 
of Alaska to Hawaii in winter. While 
they occur in the Hawaii Study Area, 
they are not sighted frequently or year- 
round. As shown in table 54, the 
maximum annual allowable instances of 
take under this rule by Level A and 
Level B harassment are 1 and 92, 
respectively. No mortality is anticipated 
or authorized, nor is any non-auditory 
injury. The total take allowable across 
all 7 years of the rule is indicated in 
table 19. 
For the Eastern North Pacific stock, 
there are no UMEs or other factors that 
cause additional concern for this stock. 
As described in the Description of 
Marine Mammals and Their Habitat in 
the Area of the Specified Activities 
section, the HCTT Study Area overlaps 
a feeding BIA for the Eastern North 
Pacific stock (Calambokidis et al., 2024). 
The Eastern North Pacific stock of blue 
whales is a migratory population that 
can occur near the coast, over the 
continental shelf, and in deep oceanic 
waters from the northern Gulf of Alaska 
to the eastern tropical Pacific. This stock 
forages in their hierarchical feeding 
BIAs off California in warmer months 
(June-November). In recent years, the 
Eastern North Pacific stock has been 
reported to spend more time (averaging 
over 8 months) on feeding grounds in 
the Southern California Bight. The 
highest densities of blue whales are 
predicted along nearshore southern 
California where most impacts will 
occur, so blue whales may be impacted 
while foraging in the designated BIAs. 
As shown in table 54, the maximum 
annual allowable instances of take 
under this rule by Level A and Level B 
harassment are 27 and 4,571, 
respectively. As indicated, the rule also 
allows for up to two takes by serious 
injury or mortality over the course of the 
7-year rule, the impacts of which are 
discussed above in the Serious Injury 
and Mortality section. The total take 
allowable across all 7 years of the rule 
is indicated in table 19. 
Regarding the potential takes 
associated with auditory impairment, as 
described in the Auditory Injury from 
Sonar Acoustic Sources and Explosives 
and Non-Auditory Injury from 
Explosives section above, any takes in 
the form of TTS are expected to be 
lower-level, of short duration (from 
minutes to, at most, several hours or less 
than a day), and mostly not in a 
frequency band that would be expected 
to interfere with blue whale 
communication or other important low- 
frequency cues. Any associated lost 
opportunities or capabilities individuals 
might experience as a result of TTS 
would not be at a level or duration that 
would be expected to impact 
reproductive success or survival. For 
similar reasons, while auditory injury 
impacts last longer, the low anticipated 
levels of AUD INJ that could be 
reasonably expected to result from these 
activities are unlikely to have any effect 
on fitness. 
Regarding the likely severity of any 
single instance of take by behavioral 
disturbance, as described above, the 
majority of the predicted exposures are 
expected to be below 172 dB SPL and 
last from a few minutes to a few hours, 
at most, with associated responses most 
likely in the form of moving away from 
the source, foraging interruptions, 
vocalization changes, or disruption of 
other social behaviors, lasting from a 
few minutes to several hours. Blue 
whales are large-bodied capital breeders 
with a slow pace of life and are 
therefore generally less susceptible to 
impacts from shorter duration foraging 
disruptions. Further, as described in the 
Group and Species-Specific Analyses 
section above and the Mitigation 
Measures section, mitigation measures 
are expected to further reduce the 
potential severity of impacts through 
real-time operational measures that 
minimize higher level/longer duration 
exposures and time/area measures that 
reduce impacts in high value habitat. 
As described above, in addition to 
evaluating the anticipated impacts of 
the single instances of takes, it is 
important to understand the degree to 
which individual marine mammals may 
be disturbed repeatedly across multiple 
days of the year. In this case, for the 
Central North Pacific stock, given the 
lower number of takes by harassment as 
compared to the stock/species 
abundance (see table 54), their 
migratory movement pattern, and the 
absence of take concentrated in areas in 
which animals are known to congregate, 
it is unlikely that any individual blue 
whales from the Central North Pacific 
stock would be taken on more than a 
limited number of days within a year 
and, therefore, the anticipated 
behavioral disturbance is not expected 
to affect reproduction or survival. For 
the Eastern North Pacific stock, given 
the number of takes by harassment as 
compared to the stock/species 
abundance (see table 54) and the fact 
that a portion of the takes occur in BIAs, 
it is likely that some portion of the 
individuals taken are taken repeatedly 
over a limited number of days. 
However, given the variety of activity 
types that contribute to take across 
separate exercises conducted at different 
times and in different areas (i.e., not concentrated within a specific region 
and season), and the fact that many 
result from transient activities 
conducted at sea, it is unlikely that 
repeated takes would occur either in 
numbers or clumped across sequential 
days in a manner likely to impact 
foraging success and energetics or other 
behaviors such that reproduction or 
survival of any individuals is likely to 
be impacted. 
Given the magnitude and severity of 
the impacts discussed above to the 
Central North Pacific stock of blue 
whales (considering annual take 
maxima and the total across 7 years) and 
their habitat, and in consideration of the 
required mitigation measures and other 
information presented, the Action 
Proponents’ activities are not expected 
to result in impacts on the reproduction 
or survival of any individuals, much 
less affect annual rates of recruitment or 
survival. For the Eastern North Pacific 
stock, as analyzed and described in the 
Serious Injury and Mortality section, 
given the status of the stock, and in 
consideration of other ongoing 
anthropogenic mortality (fisheries 
interactions, vessel strike), the 
authorized M/SI (two over the course of 
the 7-year rule, or 0.29 annually) will 
not, alone, nor in combination with the 
impacts of the take by harassment 
discussed above (which is not expected 
to impact the reproduction or survival 
of any individuals), be expected to 
adversely affect rates of recruitment and 
survival for any of this stock. For these 
reasons, we have determined that the 
total take (considering annual maxima 
and across 7 years) anticipated and 
authorized will have a negligible impact 
on the Eastern North Pacific and Central 
North Pacific stocks of blue whale. 
Bryde’s Whale (Eastern Tropical Pacific 
and Hawaii Stocks)— 
Little is known about the movements 
of Bryde’s whales in the Study Area, but 
seasonal shifts in their distribution 
occur toward and away from the equator 
in winter and summer. Therefore, both 
populations of Bryde’s whales are at 
least somewhat migratory populations 
that travel within their tropical and 
subtropical ranges year-round. There are 
no known biologically important areas 
for Bryde’s whales in the HCTT Study 
Area. Bryde’s whales face several

vessel strike, fisheries interactions, 
habitat degradation, pollution, vessel 
disturbance, and ocean noise, among 
others. 
Bryde’s whales in the Eastern 
Tropical Pacific have not been 
designated as a stock under the MMPA, 
are not ESA-listed, and there is no 
current reported population trend. The 
Navy’s NMSDD estimates the Eastern 
Tropical Pacific Bryde’s whale is 69 
animals. As shown in table 54, the 
maximum annual allowable instances of 
take under this rule by Level A and 
Level B harassment are 5 and 322, 
respectively. No mortality is anticipated 
or authorized, nor is any non-auditory 
injury. The total take allowable across 
all 7 years of the rule is indicated in 
table 19. 
The Hawaii stock of Bryde’s whale is 
not listed as threatened or endangered 
under the ESA and is not considered 
depleted or strategic under the MMPA. 
The current stock abundance estimate of 
the Hawaii stock of Bryde’s whale is 791 
animals. The stock’s primary range 
extends outside of the HCTT Study 
Area. There are no UMEs or other 
factors that cause particular concern for 
this stock. Bryde’s whales are the only 
baleen whale found in Hawaiian waters 
year-round, and the only mysticete in 
Hawaii that does not undergo 
predictable north-south seasonal 
migrations. However, Bryde’s whales 
occur mostly in offshore waters of the 
North Pacific. As shown in table 54, the 
maximum annual allowable instances of 
take under this rule by Level A and 
Level B harassment are 3 and 409, 
respectively. No mortality is anticipated 
or authorized, nor is any non-auditory 
injury. The total take allowable across 
all 7 years of the rule is indicated in 
table 19. 
Regarding the potential takes 
associated with auditory impairment, as 
described in the Auditory Injury from 
Sonar Acoustic Sources and Explosives 
and Non-Auditory Injury from 
Explosives section above, any takes in 
the form of TTS are expected to be 
lower-level, of short duration (from 
minutes to, at most, several hours or less 
than a day), and mostly not in a 
frequency band that would be expected 
to interfere with Bryde’s whale 
communication or other important low- 
frequency cues. Any associated lost 
opportunities or capabilities individuals 
might experience as a result of TTS 
would not be at a level or duration that 
would be expected to impact 
reproductive success or survival. For 
similar reasons, while auditory injury 
impacts last longer, the low anticipated 
levels of AUD INJ that could be 
reasonably expected to result from these 
activities are unlikely to have any effect 
on fitness. 
Regarding the likely severity of any 
single instance of take by behavioral 
disturbance, as described above, the 
majority of the predicted exposures are 
expected to be below 172 dB SPL and 
last from a few minutes to a few hours, 
at most, with associated responses most 
likely in the form of moving away from 
the source, foraging interruptions, 
vocalization changes, or disruption of 
other social behaviors, lasting from a 
few minutes to several hours. Bryde’s 
whales are large-bodied income 
breeders with a slow pace of life and 
may be susceptible to energetic costs 
from foraging disruption, especially 
during lactation. Further, as described 
in the Group and Species-Specific 
Analyses section above and the Mitigation Measures section, mitigation 
measures are expected to further reduce 
the potential severity of impacts to the 
Hawaii stock through real-time 
operational measures that minimize 
higher level/longer duration exposures 
and time/area measures that reduce 
impacts in high value habitat. 
As described above, in addition to 
evaluating the anticipated impacts of 
the single instances of takes, it is 
important to understand the degree to 
which individual marine mammals may 
be disturbed repeatedly across multiple 
days of the year. In this case, given the 
number of takes by harassment as 
compared to the stock/species 
abundance (see table 54), it is likely that 
some portion of the individuals taken 
from the Eastern Tropical Pacific stock 
are taken repeatedly over a moderate 
number of days. However, given the 
variety of activity types that contribute 
to take across separate exercises 
conducted at different times and in 
different areas, and the fact that many 
result from transient activities 
conducted at sea, it is unlikely that 
repeated takes would occur either in 
numbers or clumped across sequential 
days in a manner likely to impact 
foraging success and energetics or other 
behaviors such that reproduction or 
survival of any individuals is likely to 
be impacted. For the Hawaii stock, 
given the lower number of takes by 
harassment as compared to the stock/ 
species abundance (see table 54), their 
migratory movement pattern, and the 
absence of take concentrated in areas in 
which animals are known to congregate, 
it is unlikely that any individual Bryde’s 
whales from the Hawaii stock would be 
taken on more than a limited number of 
days within a year and, therefore, the 
anticipated behavioral disturbance is 
not expected to affect reproduction or 
survival. 
Given the magnitude and severity of 
the impacts discussed above to Bryde’s 
whales in the Eastern Tropical Pacific 
(considering annual take maxima and 
the total across 7 years) and their 
habitat, and in consideration of the 
required mitigation measures and other 
information presented, the Action 
Proponents’ activities are not expected 
to result in impacts on the reproduction 
or survival of any individuals, much 
less affect annual rates of recruitment or 
survival. For these reasons, we have 
determined that the anticipated and 
authorized take will have a negligible 
impact on the Eastern Tropical Pacific 
and Hawaii stocks of Bryde’s whale. 
Fin Whale (Hawaii and CA/OR/WA 
Stocks)— 
Fin whales are listed as endangered 
under the ESA and depleted and 
strategic under the MMPA. Fin whales 
have higher abundances in temperate 
and polar waters, and are not frequently 
seen in warm, tropical waters. Fin 
whales face several chronic 
anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic 
risk factors, including vessel strike, 
fisheries interactions, habitat 
degradation, pollution, vessel 
disturbance, and ocean noise, among 
others. 
The Navy’s NMSDD estimates the 
abundance of the Hawaii stock of fin 
whale is 226 and the CA/OR/WA stock 
of fin whale is 12,304. There are no 
UMEs or other factors that cause 
particular concern for these stocks, and 
there are no known biologically 
important areas for the Hawaii stock of 
fin whale in the HCTT Study Area. The 
Hawaii stock of fin whales are not 
sighted frequently or year-round, and 
likely only migrate to the Hawaii 
portion of the HCTT Study Area during 
fall and winter. As shown in table 54, 
the maximum annual allowable 
instances of take under this rule by 
Level A Harassment and Level B 
harassment are 1 and 86, respectively. 
No mortality is anticipated or 
authorized, nor is any non-auditory 
injury. The total take allowable across 
all 7 years of the rule is indicated in 
table 19. 
For the CA/OR/WA stock, as 
described in the Description of Marine 
Mammals and Their Habitat in the Area 
of the Specified Activities section, the 
HCTT Study Area overlaps a feeding 
BIA (Parent and Child) for this stock 
(Calambokidis et al., 2024). This stock of fin whales is a migratory-resident 
population that travels along the entire 
U.S. west coast and may be present 
throughout the year in southern and

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258990 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations central California. There are generally 
higher densities farther offshore in the 
summer and fall, and closer to shore in 
winter and spring. As shown in table 54, 
the maximum annual allowable 
instances of take under this rule by 
Level A and Level B harassment are 55 
and 13,501, respectively. The rule 
allows for a limited number of takes by 
non-auditory injury (one animal). As 
indicated, the rule also allows for up to 
six takes by serious injury or mortality 
over the course of the 7-year rule, the 
impacts of which are discussed above in 
the Serious Injury and Mortality section. 
The total take allowable across all 7 
years of the rule is indicated in table 19. 
Regarding the potential takes 
associated with auditory impairment, as 
described in the Auditory Injury from 
Sonar Acoustic Sources and Explosives 
and Non-Auditory Injury from 
Explosives section above, any takes in 
the form of TTS are expected to be 
lower-level, of short duration (from 
minutes to, at most, several hours or less 
than a day), and mostly not in a 
frequency band that would be expected 
to interfere with fin whale 
communication and other important 
low-frequency cues. Any associated lost 
opportunities or capabilities individuals 
might experience as a result of TTS 
would not be at a level or duration that 
would be expected to impact 
reproductive success or survival. For 
similar reasons, while auditory injury 
impacts last longer, the low anticipated 
levels of AUD INJ that could be 
reasonably expected to result from these 
activities are unlikely to have any effect 
on fitness. The rule also allows for a 
limited number of takes by non-auditory 
injury (one animal) for this stock. As 
described above in the Auditory Injury 
from Sonar Acoustic Sources and 
Explosives and Non-Auditory Injury 
from Explosives section, given the 
limited number of potential exposures 
and the anticipated effectiveness of the 
mitigation measures in minimizing the 
pressure levels to which any individuals 
are exposed, these non-auditory injuries 
are unlikely to be of a nature or level 
that would impact reproduction or 
survival. 
Regarding the likely severity of any 
single instance of take by behavioral 
disturbance, as described above, the 
majority of the predicted exposures are 
expected to be below 172 dB SPL and 
last from a few minutes to a few hours, 
at most, with associated responses most 
likely in the form of moving away from 
the source, foraging interruptions, 
vocalization changes, or disruption of 
other social behaviors, lasting from a 
few minutes to several hours. Fin 
whales are large-bodied capital breeders 
with a slow pace of life and are 
therefore generally less susceptible to 
impacts from shorter duration foraging 
disruptions. Further, as described in the 
Group and Species-Specific Analyses 
section above and the Mitigation 
Measures section, mitigation measures 
are expected to further reduce the 
potential severity of impacts through 
real-time operational measures that 
minimize higher level/longer duration 
exposures and time/area measures that 
reduce impacts in high value habitat. 
As described above, in addition to 
evaluating the anticipated impacts of 
the single instances of takes, it is 
important to understand the degree to 
which individual marine mammals may 
be disturbed repeatedly across multiple 
days of the year. In this case, given the 
number of takes by harassment as 
compared to the stock/species 
abundance (see table 54) and the fact 
that a portion of the takes occur in BIAs 
for the CA/OR/WA stock, it is likely that 
some portion of the individuals of each 
stock are taken repeatedly over a limited 
number of days. However, given the 
variety of activity types that contribute 
to take across separate exercises 
conducted at different times and in 
different areas, and the fact that many 
result from transient activities 
conducted at sea, it is unlikely that 
repeated takes would occur either in 
numbers or clumped across sequential 
days in a manner likely to impact 
foraging success and energetics or other 
behaviors such that reproduction or 
survival of any individuals is likely to 
be impacted. 
Fin whales have the largest 
hierarchical feeding BIAs spanning the 
coast of California from June to 
November, which overlap more with 
PMSR and SOCAL compared to 
NOCAL, as the core BIAs are generally 
farther offshore in northern California. 
Impacts would be attributable to various 
activities in summer and fall (warm 
season), with most impacts occurring in 
southern California year-round. 
However, this stock is migratory and 
Navy activities are not anticipated to 
overlap a large portion of the BIAs, 
leaving large areas of important foraging 
habitat available. 
Given the magnitude and severity of 
the impacts discussed above to the 
Hawaii stock of fin whales (considering 
annual take maxima and the total across 
7 years) and their habitat, and in 
consideration of the required mitigation 
measures and other information 
presented, the Action Proponents’ 
activities are unlikely to result in 
impacts on the reproduction or survival 
of any individuals and, therefore, 
unlikely to affect annual rates of 
recruitment or survival. For the CA/OR/ 
WA stock, as analyzed and described in 
the Serious Injury and Mortality section, 
given the status of the stock and in 
consideration of other ongoing 
anthropogenic mortality (fisheries 
interactions, vessel strike), the 
authorized M/SI (six over the course of 
the 7-year rule, or 0.86 annually) will 
not, alone, nor in combination with the 
impacts of the take by harassment 
discussed above (which is not expected 
to impact the reproduction or survival 
of any individuals), be expected to 
adversely affect rates of recruitment and 
survival for any of this stock. For these 
reasons, we have determined that the 
total take (considering annual maxima 
and across 7 years) anticipated and 
authorized will have a negligible impact 
on the CA/OR/WA and Hawaii stocks of 
fin whale. 
Humpback Whale (Central America/ 
Southern Mexico—CA/OR/WA, 
Mainland Mexico—CA/OR/WA, and 
Hawaii Stocks)— 
Humpback whales occur throughout 
the HCTT Study Area, and the two 
stocks (Central America/Southern 
Mexico—CA/OR/WA and Mainland 
Mexico—CA/OR/WA) that occur in the 
California portion of the Study Area are 
most abundant in shelf and slope waters 
which are areas of high productivity and 
often sighted near shore, while also 
frequently moving through deep 
offshore waters during migration. In the 
Hawaii portion of the Study Area, the 
Hawaii stock of humpback whales occur 
seasonally in nearshore waters 
surrounding the main Hawaiian Islands 
during breeding season (typically 
December through May). The HCTT 
Study Area overlaps ESA-designated 
critical habitat for the endangered 
Central America DPS and the Mexico 
DPS of humpback whales along the west 
coast (86 FR 21082, April 21, 2021), as 
described in the Description of Marine 
Mammals and Their Habitat in the Area 
of Specified Activities section. There are 
no UMEs or other factors that cause 
particular concern for these stocks. The 
HCTT Study Area overlaps a feeding 
BIA (Parent and Core) for the two stocks 
that occur in California (Calambokidis et 
al., 2024), and a reproductive BIA (Parent and Child) for the Hawaii stock 
(Kratofil et al., 2023). Humpback whales face several anthropogenic and non- 
anthropogenic risk factors, including 
vessel strikes, fisheries interactions, 
habitat degradation, pollution, vessel 
disturbance, and ocean noise, among 
others.

as both depleted and strategic under the 
MMPA. The Navy’s NMSDD estimates 
this stock size is 1,603. As shown in 
table 54, the maximum annual 
allowable instances of take under this 
rule by Level A harassment and Level B 
harassment are 19 and 1,888, 
respectively. As indicated, the rule also 
allows for up to two takes by serious 
injury or mortality over the course of the 
7-year rule, the impacts of which are 
discussed above in the Serious Injury 
and Mortality section. 
The Mainland Mexico—CA/OR/WA 
stock (part of the Mexico DPS) of 
humpback whale is listed as threatened 
under the ESA and as both depleted and 
strategic under the MMPA. The Navy’s 
NMSDD estimates this stock size is 
3,741. As shown in table 54, the 
maximum annual allowable instances of 
take under this rule by Level A 
harassment and Level B harassment are 
44 and 4,449 respectively. The rule 
allows for a limited number of takes by 
non-auditory injury (one animal). As 
described above, given the limited 
number of potential exposures and the 
anticipated effectiveness of the 
mitigation measures in minimizing the 
pressure levels to which any individuals 
are exposed, these injuries are unlikely 
to impact reproduction or survival. As 
indicated, the rule also allows for up to 
two takes by serious injury or mortality 
over the course of the 7-year rule, the 
impacts of which are discussed above in 
the Serious Injury and Mortality section. 
The Hawaii stock of humpback whale 
is not listed as endangered under the 
ESA and as neither depleted nor 
strategic under the MMPA. The current 
stock abundance estimate of the Hawaii 
stock (Hawaii DPS) is 11,278. The 
stock’s primary range extends outside of 
the HCTT Study Area. As shown in 
table 54, the maximum annual 
allowable instances of take under this 
rule by Level A and Level B harassment 
are 24 and 3,034, respectively. As 
indicated, the rule also allows for up to 
three takes by serious injury or mortality 
over the course of the 7-year rule, the 
impacts of which are discussed above in 
the Serious Injury and Mortality section. 
The total take allowable for each stock 
across all 7 years of the rule is indicated 
in table 19. 
Regarding the potential takes 
associated with auditory impairment, as 
described in the Auditory Injury from 
Sonar Acoustic Sources and Explosives 
and Non-Auditory Injury from 
Explosives section above, any takes in 
the form of TTS are expected to be 
lower-level, of short duration (from 
minutes to, at most, several hours or less 
than a day), and mostly not in a 
frequency band that would be expected 
to interfere with humpback whale 
communication or other important low- 
frequency cues. Any associated lost 
opportunities or capabilities individuals 
might experience as a result of TTS 
would not be at a level or duration that 
would be expected to impact 
reproductive success or survival. For 
similar reasons, while auditory injury 
impacts last longer, the low anticipated 
levels of AUD INJ that could be 
reasonably expected to result from these 
activities are unlikely to have any effect 
on fitness. The rule also allows for one 
take by non-auditory injury for the 
Mainland Mexico—CA/OR/WA stock. 
As described above, given the limited 
number of potential exposures and the 
anticipated effectiveness of the 
mitigation measures in minimizing the 
pressure levels to which any individuals 
are exposed, this non-auditory injury is 
unlikely to be of a nature or level that 
would impact reproduction or survival. 
Regarding the likely severity of any 
single instance of take by behavioral 
disturbance, as described above, the 
majority of the predicted exposures are 
expected to be below 172 dB SPL and 
last from a few minutes to a few hours, 
at most, with associated responses most 
likely in the form of moving away from 
the source, foraging interruptions, 
vocalization changes, or disruption of 
other social behaviors, lasting from a 
few minutes to several hours. 
Humpback whales are large-bodied 
capital breeders with a slow pace of life 
and are therefore generally less 
susceptible to impacts from shorter 
duration foraging disruptions. Further, 
as described in the Group and Species- 
Specific Analyses section above and the 
Mitigation Measures section, mitigation 
measures are expected to further reduce 
the potential severity of impacts through 
real-time operational measures that 
minimize higher level/longer duration 
exposures and time/area measures that 
reduce impacts in high value habitat. In 
particular, for the Mainland Mexico— 
CA/OR/WA stock, this rulemaking 
includes the Northern California Large 
Whale Mitigation Area and Central 
California Large Whale Mitigation Area. 
From June 1 through October 31, the 
Action Proponents must not use more 
than 300 combined hours of MF1 and 
MF1C surface ship hull-mounted MFAS 
(excluding normal maintenance and 
systems checks) total during training 
and testing within the combination of 
the Northern California Large Whale 
Mitigation Area, the Central California 
Large Whale Mitigation Area, and the 
Southern California Blue Whale 
Mitigation Area. These restrictions 
would reduce exposure of humpback 
whales in important seasonal foraging, 
migratory, and calving habitats to levels 
of sound that have the potential to cause 
injurious or behavioral impacts. 
As described above, in addition to 
evaluating the anticipated impacts of 
the single instances of takes, it is 
important to understand the degree to 
which individual marine mammals may 
be disturbed repeatedly across multiple 
days of the year. In this case, for the 
Mainland Mexico—CA/OR/WA and 
Central America/Southern Mexico—CA/ 
OR/WA stocks, given the number of 
takes by harassment as compared to the 
stock/species abundance (see table 54) 
and the fact that a portion of the takes 
of both stocks occur in BIAs, it is likely 
that some portion of the individuals 
taken are taken repeatedly over a 
limited number of days. However, given 
the variety of activity types that 
contribute to take across separate 
exercises conducted at different times 
and in different areas, and the fact that 
many result from transient activities 
conducted at sea, it is unlikely that 
repeated takes would occur either in 
numbers or clumped across sequential 
days in a manner likely to impact 
foraging success and energetics or other 
behaviors such that reproduction or 
survival of any individuals is likely to 
be impacted. Further, these stocks are 
migratory, and although some impacts 
to these stocks would occur in critical 
habitat and BIAs important for foraging 
off the coast of California, there are large 
areas available outside of the Study 
Area that contain high-quality foraging 
habitat for both stocks. Further, the 
majority of impacts to these stocks are 
anticipated to occur during the cold 
season, a portion of which (December to 
February) the BIAs for feeding are not 
considered to be active. 
For the Hawaii stock, given the lower 
number of takes by harassment as 
compared to the stock/species 
abundance (see table 54), their 
migratory movement pattern, and the 
absence of take concentrated in areas in 
which animals are known to congregate, 
it is unlikely that any individual 
humpback whales from the Hawaii 
stock would be taken on more than a 
limited number of days within a year 
and, therefore, the anticipated 
behavioral disturbance is not expected 
to affect reproduction or survival. 
For all three stocks, as described in 
the Serious Injury and Mortality section, 
given the status of the stocks, and in 
consideration of other ongoing 
anthropogenic mortality, the M/SI 
authorized here will not, alone, nor in 
combination with the impacts of the 
take by harassment discussed above

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258992 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations (which is not expected to impact the 
reproduction or survival of any 
individuals), be expected to adversely 
affect rates of recruitment and survival. 
For these reasons, we have determined 
that the total take (considering annual 
maxima and across 7 years) anticipated 
and authorized will have a negligible 
impact on the Central America/ 
Southern Mexico—CA/OR/WA, 
Mainland Mexico—CA/OR/WA, and 
Hawaii stocks of humpback whales. 
Minke Whale (Hawaii and CA/OR/WA 
Stocks)— 
Minke whales in the HCTT Study 
Area are not listed as threatened or 
endangered under the ESA, and neither 
the Hawaii stock nor the CA/OR/WA 
stock are considered depleted or 
strategic under the MMPA. There are no 
UMEs or other factors that cause 
particular concern for either stock, and 
there are no known biologically 
important areas for minke whales in the 
HCTT Study Area. Minke whales face 
several chronic anthropogenic and non- 
anthropogenic risk factors, including 
vessel strike, fisheries interactions, 
habitat degradation, pollution, vessel 
disturbance, and disease, among others. 
The Navy’s NMSDD estimates the 
abundance of the Hawaii stock of minke 
whale is 509 animals and the CA/OR/ 
WA stock of minke whale is 1,342 
animals. The stock’s primary range 
extends outside of the HCTT Study 
Area. The Hawaii stock generally 
congregates in Hawaiian water in the 
colder months (fall to spring) and 
migrates to more productive areas in 
winter. As shown in table 54, the 
maximum annual allowable instances of 
take under this rule by Level A and 
Level B harassment are 3 and 296, 
respectively. The CA/OR/WA stock can 
be found year-round in southern 
California, generally congregating in 
nearshore waters over the continental 
shelf off California, and has low 
variability in annual distribution 
patterns. As shown in table 54, the 
maximum annual allowable instances of 
take under this rule by Level A and 
Level B harassment are 32 and 2,993, 
respectively. No mortality is anticipated 
or authorized for either stock, nor is any 
non-auditory injury. The total take 
allowable across all 7 years of the rule 
is indicated in table 19. Regarding the 
potential takes associated with auditory 
impairment, as described in the 
Auditory Injury from Sonar Acoustic 
Sources and Explosives and Non- 
Auditory Injury from Explosives section 
above, any takes in the form of TTS are 
expected to be lower-level, of short 
duration, and mostly not in a frequency 
band that would be expected to interfere 
with minke whale communication or 
other important low-frequency cues. 
Any associated lost opportunities or 
capabilities individuals might 
experience as a result of TTS would not 
be at a level or duration that would be 
expected to impact reproductive success 
or survival. For similar reasons, while 
auditory injury impacts last longer, the 
low anticipated levels of AUD INJ that 
could be reasonably expected to result 
from these activities are unlikely to have 
any effect on fitness. 
Regarding the likely severity of any 
single instance of take by behavioral 
disturbance, as described above, the 
majority of the predicted exposures are 
expected to be below 172 dB SPL and 
last from a few minutes to a few hours, 
at most, with associated responses most 
likely in the form of moving away from 
the source, foraging interruptions, 
vocalization changes, or disruption of 
other social behaviors, lasting from a 
few minutes to several hours. Minke 
whales are medium-to-large-bodied 
capital breeders with a slow pace of life 
and are therefore generally less 
susceptible to impacts from shorter 
duration foraging disruptions. Further, 
as described in the Group and Species- 
Specific Analyses section above and the 
Mitigation Measures section, mitigation 
measures are expected to further reduce 
the potential severity of impacts through 
real-time operational measures that 
minimize higher level/longer duration 
exposures and time/area measures that 
reduce impacts in high value habitat. 
As described above, in addition to 
evaluating the anticipated impacts of 
the single instances of takes, it is 
important to understand the degree to 
which individual marine mammals may 
be disturbed repeatedly across multiple 
days of the year. In this case, for the 
Hawaii stock, given the lower number of 
takes by harassment as compared to the 
stock/species abundance (see table 54), 
their migratory movement pattern, and 
the absence of take concentrated in 
areas in which animals are known to 
congregate, it is unlikely that any 
individual minke whales from the 
Hawaii stock would be taken on more 
than a limited number of days within a 
year and, therefore, the anticipated 
behavioral disturbance is not expected 
to affect reproduction or survival. For 
the CA/OR/WA stock, given the number 
of takes by harassment as compared to 
the stock/species abundance (see table 
54), it is likely that some portion of the 
individuals taken are taken repeatedly 
over a limited to moderate number of 
days. However, given the variety of 
activity types that contribute to take 
across separate exercises conducted at 
different times and in different areas, 
and the fact that many result from 
transient activities conducted at sea, it 
is unlikely that repeated takes would 
occur either in numbers or clumped 
across sequential days in a manner 
likely to impact foraging success and 
energetics or other behaviors such that 
reproduction or survival of any 
individuals is likely to be impacted. 
Given the magnitude and severity of 
the impacts discussed above to the CA/ 
OR/WA and Hawaii stocks of minke 
whale (considering annual take maxima 
and the total across 7 years) and their 
habitat, and in consideration of the 
required mitigation measures and other 
information presented, the Action 
Proponents’ activities are not expected 
to result in impacts on the reproduction 
or survival of any individuals, much 
less affect annual rates of recruitment or 
survival. For these reasons, we have 
determined that the take by harassment 
anticipated and authorized will have a 
negligible impact on the Hawaii and 
CA/OR/WA stocks of minke whales. 
Sei Whale (Hawaii and Eastern North 
Pacific Stocks)— 
Sei whales are listed as endangered 
under the ESA and as both depleted and 
strategic under the MMPA. Sei whales 
generally have higher abundances in the 
cold and deep water of the open ocean. 
There are no UMEs or other factors that 
cause particular concern for either 
stock, and there are no known 
biologically important areas for sei 
whales in the HCTT Study Area. Sei 
whales face several chronic 
anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic 
risk factors, including vessel strike, 
fisheries interactions, and ocean noise, 
among others. 
The Navy’s NMSDD estimates the 
abundance of the Hawaii stock is 452 
and the Eastern North Pacific stock is 
864 animals. The Hawaii stock’s 
primary range is outside of the HCTT 
Study Area. This stock is migratory and 
not frequently detected in Hawaii, 
traveling from their cold subpolar 
latitudes to Hawaii in the winter, where 
they are more likely to be on the Hawaii 
Range Complex in the cold season. As 
shown in table 54, the maximum annual 
allowable instances of take under this 
rule by Level A and Level B harassment 
are 2 and 253, respectively. No mortality 
of the Hawaii stock is anticipated or 
authorized, nor is any non-auditory 
injury. 
The Eastern North Pacific stock 
occurs year-round in deep offshore 
waters of California, and is likely to 
occur in the Transit Corridor of the 
HCTT Study Area. The Eastern North 
Pacific stock seasonally migrates, 
though to a lesser extent compared to

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES258993 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations other large whales. As shown in table 
54, the maximum annual allowable 
instances of take under this rule by 
Level A and Level B harassment are 3 
and 302, respectively. As indicated, the 
rule also allows for up to two takes by 
serious injury or mortality over the 
course of the 7-year rule, the impacts of 
which are discussed above in the 
Serious Injury and Mortality section. 
The total take allowable across all 7 
years of the rule for both stocks is 
indicated in table 19. 
Regarding the potential takes 
associated with auditory impairment, as 
described in the Auditory Injury from 
Sonar Acoustic Sources and Explosives 
and Non-Auditory Injury from 
Explosives section above, any takes in 
the form of TTS are expected to be 
lower-level, of short duration (from 
minutes to, at most, several hours or less 
than a day), and mostly not in a 
frequency band that would be expected 
to interfere with sei whale 
communication or other important low- 
frequency cues. Any associated lost 
opportunities or capabilities individuals 
might experience as a result of TTS 
would not be at a level or duration that 
would be expected to impact 
reproductive success or survival. For 
similar reasons, while auditory injury 
impacts last longer, the low anticipated 
levels of AUD INJ that could be 
reasonably expected to result from these 
activities are unlikely to have any effect 
on fitness. 
Regarding the likely severity of any 
single instance of take by behavioral 
disturbance, as described above, the 
majority of the predicted exposures are 
expected to be below 172 dB SPL and 
last from a few minutes to a few hours, 
at most, with associated responses most 
likely in the form of moving away from 
the source, foraging interruptions, 
vocalization changes, or disruption of 
other social behaviors, lasting from a 
few minutes to several hours. Sei 
whales are large-bodied capital breeders 
with a slow pace of life and are 
therefore generally less susceptible to 
impacts from shorter duration foraging 
disruptions. Further, as described in the 
Group and Species-Specific Analyses 
section above and the Mitigation 
Measures section, mitigation measures 
are expected to further reduce the 
potential severity of impacts through 
real-time operational measures that 
minimize higher level/longer duration 
exposures and time/area measures that 
reduce impacts in high value habitat. 
As described above, in addition to 
evaluating the anticipated impacts of 
the single instances of takes, it is 
important to understand the degree to 
which individual marine mammals may 
be disturbed repeatedly across multiple 
days of the year. In this case, given the 
lower number of takes by harassment as 
compared to the stock/species 
abundance (see table 54), their 
migratory movement pattern, and the 
absence of take concentrated in areas in 
which animals are known to congregate, 
it is unlikely that any individual from 
either stock would be taken on more 
than a limited number of days within a 
year and, therefore, the anticipated 
behavioral disturbance is not expected 
to affect reproduction or survival. 
Given the magnitude and severity of 
the impacts discussed above to the 
Hawaii stock of sei whales (considering 
annual take maxima and the total across 
7 years) and their habitat, and in 
consideration of the required mitigation 
measures and other information 
presented, the Action Proponents’ 
activities are not expected to result in 
impacts on the reproduction or survival 
of any individuals, much less affect 
annual rates of recruitment or survival. 
For the CA/OR/WA stock, as analyzed 
and described in the Serious Injury and 
Mortality section above, given the status 
of the stock, the authorized M/SI for 
CA/OR/WA sei whales (two over the 
course of the 7-year rule, or 0.29 
annually) would not, alone, be expected 
to adversely affect the stock through 
rates of recruitment or survival. Given 
the magnitude and severity of the take 
by harassment discussed above and any 
anticipated habitat impacts, and in 
consideration of the required mitigation 
measures and other information 
presented, the authorized take by 
harassment is unlikely to result in 
impacts on the reproduction or survival 
of any individuals and, therefore, 
unlikely to affect annual rates of 
recruitment or survival either alone or 
in combination with the authorized M/ 
SI. For these reasons, we have 
determined that the take by harassment 
anticipated and authorized will have a 
negligible impact on the Hawaii and 
CA/OR/WA stocks of sei whales. 
Odontocetes 
This section builds on the broader 
discussion above and brings together the 
discussion of the different types and 
amounts of take that different stocks 
will incur, the applicable mitigation for 
each stock, and the status and life 
history of the stocks to support the 
negligible impact determinations for 
each stock. We have already described 
above why we believe the incremental 
addition of the limited number of low- 
level auditory injury takes will not have 
any meaningful effect towards 
inhibiting reproduction or survival. We 
have also described above in this 
section the unlikelihood of any masking 
or habitat impacts having effects that 
would impact the reproduction or 
survival of any of the individual marine 
mammals affected by the Action 
Proponents’ activities. Some odontocete 
stocks have predicted non-auditory 
injury from explosives, discussed 
further below. Regarding the severity of 
individual takes by Level B harassment 
by behavioral disturbance for 
odontocetes, the majority of these 
responses are anticipated to occur at 
received levels below 178 dB for most 
odontocete species and below 154 dB 
for sensitive species (i.e., beaked whales and harbor porpoises, for which a lower 
behavioral disturbance threshold is 
applied), and last from a few minutes to 
a few hours, at most, with associated 
responses most likely in the form of 
moving away from the source, foraging 
interruptions, vocalization changes, or 
disruption of other social behaviors, 
lasting from a few minutes to several 
hours. Much of the discussion below 
focuses on the behavioral effects and the 
mitigation measures that reduce the 
probability or severity of effects in 
biologically important areas or other 
habitats. Because there are multiple 
stock-specific factors in relation to the 
status of the species, as well as mortality 
take for several stocks, at the end of the 
section we break out stock- or group- 
specific findings. 
In table 56 (sperm whales, dwarf 
sperm whales, and pygmy sperm 
whales), table 58 (beaked whales), table 
60 (dolphins and small whales), table 62 
(porpoises), and table 64 (pinnipeds) 
below, we indicate the total annual 
mortality, Level A harassment, and 
Level B harassment, and the maximum 
annual harassment as a percentage of 
stock abundance.

sperm whales, and pygmy sperm 
whales), table 59 (beaked whales), table 
61 (dolphins and small whales), table 63 
(porpoises), and table 65 (pinnipeds), 
below, we indicate the status, life 
history traits, important habitats, and 
threats that inform our analysis of the 
potential impacts of the estimated take 
on the affected odontocete stocks.

Sperm Whales, Dwarf Sperm Whales, 
and Pygmy Sperm Whales— 
Sperm Whale (Hawaii and CA/OR/WA 
Stocks) 
Sperm whales are listed as 
endangered under the ESA and are 
considered depleted and strategic under 
the MMPA. The Navy’s NMSDD 
estimate for the Hawaii stock is 6,062 
animals and for the CA/OR/WA stock is 
4,549 animals. There are no UMEs or 
other factors that cause particular 
concern for these stocks, and there are 
no known biologically important areas 
for the sperm whales in the HCTT Study 
Area. Sperm whales generally have 
higher abundances in deep water and 
areas of high productivity and are 
somewhat migratory, but their 
movement ecology is demographically 
dependent. The Hawaii stock is 
residential and occurs in Hawaiian 
waters year-round, while the CA/OR/ 
WA stock is somewhat migratory, with 
some individuals leaving warm waters 
in summer to travel north to their arctic 
feeding grounds and returning south in 
the fall and winter. Sperm whales face 
several chronic anthropogenic and non- 
anthropogenic risk factors, including 
vessel strike, fisheries interactions, 
pollution, ocean noise, and disease, 
among others. 
As shown in table 56, the maximum 
annual allowable instances of take 
under this rule by Level A and Level B 
harassment are 1 (Hawaii stock) and 3 
(CA/OR/WA stock), and 1,649 (Hawaii 
stock) to 3,891 (CA/OR/WA stock), 
respectively. As indicated, the rule also 
allows for up to one take by serious 
injury or mortality of Hawaii sperm 
whales over the course of the 7-year 
rule, the impacts of which are discussed 
above in the Serious Injury and 
Mortality section. The total take 
allowable for each stock across all 7 
years of the rule is indicated in table 19. 
Regarding the potential takes 
associated with auditory impairment, as 
described in the Auditory Injury from 
Sonar Acoustic Sources and Explosives 
and Non-Auditory Injury from 
Explosives section above, any takes in 
the form of TTS are expected to be 
lower-level, of short duration (from 
minutes to, at most, several hours or less 
than a day), and mostly not in a 
frequency band that would be expected 
to interfere with sperm whale 
communication or other important low- 
frequency cues. Any associated lost 
opportunities or capabilities individuals 
might experience as a result of TTS 
would not be at a level or duration that 
would be expected to impact 
reproductive success or survival. For 
similar reasons, while auditory injury 
impacts last longer, the low anticipated 
levels of AUD INJ that could be 
reasonably expected to result from these 
activities are unlikely to have any effect 
on fitness. 
Regarding the likely severity of any 
single instance of take by behavioral 
disturbance, as described above, the 
majority of the predicted exposures are 
expected to be below 178 dB SPL and 
last from a few minutes to a few hours, 
at most, with associated responses most 
likely in the form of moving away from 
the source, foraging interruptions, 
vocalization changes, or disruption of 
other social behaviors, lasting from a 
few minutes to several hours. Sperm 
whales are large-bodied income 
breeders with a slow pace of life and are 
likely more resilient to missed foraging 
opportunities due to acoustic 
disturbance than smaller odontocetes. 
However, they may be more susceptible 
to impacts due to lost foraging 
opportunities during reproduction, 
especially if they occur during lactation 
(Farmer et al., 2018b). Further, as described in the Group and Species- 
Specific Analyses section above and the 
Mitigation Measures section, mitigation 
measures are expected to further reduce 
the potential severity of impacts through 
real-time operational measures that 
minimize higher level/longer duration 
exposures and time/area measures that 
reduce impacts in high value habitat. 
As described above, in addition to 
evaluating the anticipated impacts of 
the single instances of takes, it is 
important to understand the degree to 
which individual marine mammals may 
be disturbed repeatedly across multiple 
days of the year. For both stocks of 
sperm whales, given the lower number 
of takes by harassment as compared to 
the stock/species abundance (see table 
56), and the absence of take 
concentrated in areas in which animals 
are known to congregate, it is unlikely 
that any individual sperm whales would 
be taken on more than a limited number 
of days within a year and, therefore, the 
anticipated behavioral disturbance is 
not expected to affect reproduction or 
survival. 
Given the magnitude and severity of 
the impacts discussed above to sperm 
whales (considering annual take 
maxima and the total across 7 years) and 
their habitat, and in consideration of the 
required mitigation measures and other 
information presented, the authorized 
take by harassment is not expected to 
impact the reproduction or survival of 
any individuals nor, as described 
previously, is the authorized mortality 
expected to adversely affect the species 
or stock. For these reasons, we have 
determined that the anticipated and 
authorized take will have a negligible 
impact on the Hawaii and CA/OR/WA 
stocks of sperm whale.

OR/WA Stocks) and Pygmy Sperm 
Whale (Hawaii and CA/OR/WA Stocks) 
Neither dwarf sperm whales nor 
pygmy sperm whales are listed under 
the ESA, and none of the stocks are 
considered depleted or strategic under 
the MMPA. The current stock 
abundance of the CA/OR/WA stock of 
pygmy sperm whale is 4,111 animals, 
and the stock abundances from Navy’s 
NMSDD are 2,426 (CA/OR/WA stock of 
dwarf sperm whale), 43,246 (Hawaii 
stock of dwarf sperm whale), and 48,589 
(Hawaii stock of pygmy sperm whale). 
There are no UMEs or other factors that 
cause particular concern for these 
stocks. As described in the Description 
of Marine Mammals and Their Habitat 
in the Area of the Specified Activities 
section, the HCTT Study Area overlaps 
two known BIAs for small and resident 
populations of the Hawaii stocks of 
dwarf and pygmy sperm whale. Dwarf 
and pygmy sperm whales face several 
chronic anthropogenic and non- 
anthropogenic risk factors, including 
fisheries interactions, marine debris, 
and ocean noise, among others. 
As shown in table 56, the maximum 
annual allowable instances of take 
under this rule by Level A and Level B 
harassment are: 915 and 45,224 for the 
Hawaii stock of dwarf sperm whale, 
respectively; 94 and 5,664 for the CA/ 
OR/WA stock of dwarf sperm whale, 
respectively; 936 and 45,787 for the 
Hawaii stock of pygmy sperm whale, 
respectively; and 107 and 5,615 for the 
CA/OR/WA stock of pygmy sperm 
whale, respectively. No mortality is 
anticipated or authorized. The rule 
allows for a limited number of takes by 
non-auditory injury (one each for the 
Hawaii stocks of dwarf and pygmy 
sperm whales). As described above, 
given the limited number of potential 
exposures and the anticipated 
effectiveness of the mitigation measures 
in minimizing the pressure levels to 
which any individuals are exposed, 
these injuries are unlikely to impact 
reproduction or survival. The total take 
allowable across all 7 years of the rule 
is indicated in table 19. 
Regarding the potential takes 
associated with auditory impairment, as 
described in the Auditory Injury from 
Sonar Acoustic Sources and Explosives 
and Non-Auditory Injury from 
Explosives section above, any takes in 
the form of TTS are expected to be 
lower-level, of short duration (from 
minutes to, at most, several hours or less 
than a day), and mostly not in a 
frequency band that would be expected 
to interfere with dwarf and pygmy 
sperm whale communication, overlap 
more than a relatively narrow portion of 
the vocalization range of any single 
species or stock, or preclude detection 
or interpretation of important low- 
frequency cues. Any associated lost 
opportunities or capabilities individuals 
might experience as a result of TTS 
would not be at a level or duration that 
would be expected to impact 
reproductive success or survival. For 
similar reasons, while auditory injury 
impacts last longer, the low anticipated 
levels of AUD INJ that could be 
reasonably expected to result from these 
activities are unlikely to have any effect 
on fitness. The rule also allows for a 
limited number of takes by non-auditory 
injury (one per stock) for the Hawaii 
stocks of dwarf and pygmy sperm 
whales. As described above in the 
Auditory Injury from Sonar Acoustic 
Sources and Explosives and Non- 
Auditory Injury from Explosives 
section, given the limited number of 
potential exposures and the anticipated 
effectiveness of the mitigation measures 
in minimizing the pressure levels to 
which any individuals are exposed, 
these non-auditory injuries are unlikely 
to be of a nature or level that would 
impact reproduction or survival for 
either of the Hawaii stocks of dwarf and 
pygmy sperm whales. 
Regarding the likely severity of any 
single instance of take by behavioral 
disturbance, as described above, the 
majority of the predicted exposures are 
expected to be below 178 dB SPL and 
last from a few minutes to a few hours, 
at most, with associated responses most 
likely in the form of moving away from 
the source, foraging interruptions, 
vocalization changes, or disruption of 
other social behaviors, lasting from a 
few minutes to several hours. Dwarf and 
pygmy sperm whales are small-to- 
medium-bodied income breeders with a 
fast pace of life. They are generally more 
sensitive to missed foraging 
opportunities than larger odontocetes, 
especially during lactation, but would 
be quick to recover given their fast pace 
of life. Further, as described in the 
Group and Species-Specific Analyses 
section above and the Mitigation 
Measures section, mitigation measures 
are expected to further reduce the 
potential severity of impacts through 
real-time operational measures that 
minimize higher level/longer duration 
exposures and time/area measures that 
reduce impacts in high value habitat. In 
particular, this rulemaking includes a 
Hawaii Island Marine Mammal 
Mitigation Area, within which the 
Action Proponents must not use more 
than 300 combined hours of MF1 and 
MF1C surface ship hull-mounted MFAS 
or 20 hours of helicopter dipping sonar 
(a MFAS source) annually and must not 
detonate in-water explosives (including 
underwater explosives and explosives 
deployed against surface targets). These 
restrictions will reduce exposure of 
numerous small and resident marine 
mammal populations, including dwarf 
and pygmy sperm whales, to levels of 
sound from sonar or explosives that 
have the potential to cause injury or 
mortality, thereby reducing the 
likelihood of those effects and, further, 
minimizing the severity of behavioral 
disturbance. 
As described above, in addition to 
evaluating the anticipated impacts of 
the single instances of takes, it is 
important to understand the degree to 
which individual marine mammals may 
be disturbed repeatedly across multiple 
days of the year. In this case, given the 
number of takes by harassment as 
compared to the stock/species 
abundance (see table 56) and the fact 
that a portion of the takes occur in BIAs 
for the Hawaii stocks, it is likely that 
some portion of the individuals taken 
are taken repeatedly over a limited to 
moderate number of days. However, 
given the variety of activity types that 
contribute to take across separate 
exercises conducted at different times 
and in different areas, and the fact that 
many result from transient activities 
conducted at sea, it is unlikely that 
repeated takes would occur either in 
numbers or clumped across sequential 
days in a manner likely to impact 
foraging success and energetics or other 
behaviors such that reproduction or 
survival of any individuals is likely to 
be impacted. 
Given the magnitude and severity of 
the impacts discussed above to dwarf 
and pygmy sperm whale stocks in the 
HCTT Study Area (considering annual 
take maxima and the total across 7 
years) and their habitats, and in 
consideration of the required mitigation 
measures and other information 
presented, the Action Proponents’ 
activities are not expected to result in 
impacts on the reproduction or survival 
of any individuals, much less affect 
annual rates of recruitment or survival. 
For these reasons, we have determined 
that the anticipated and authorized take 
will have a negligible impact on the 
Hawaii and CA/OR/WA stocks of dwarf 
and pygmy sperm whales.

from 1,300 (Hawaii stock of Blainville’s 
beaked whale, NMSDD) to 13,531 (CA/ 
OR/WA stock of goose-beaked whale, 
NMSDD). There are no UMEs or other 
factors that cause particular concern for 
these stocks in the HCTT Study Area. 
As described in the Description of 
Marine Mammals and Their Habitat in 
the Area of the Specified Activities 
section, the HCTT Study Area overlaps 
two known biologically important areas 
for small and resident populations for 
the Hawaii stocks of Blainville’s and 
goose-beaked whales. Beaked whales 
face several chronic anthropogenic and 
non-anthropogenic risk factors, 
including fisheries interactions, and 
ocean noise, among others. 
As shown in table 58, the maximum 
annual allowable instances of take 
under this rule by Level A and Level B 
harassment range from 0 to 2, and 7,542 
and 166,816, respectively. No mortality 
is anticipated or authorized, nor is any 
non-auditory injury. The total take 
allowable across all 7 years of the rule 
is indicated in table 19. 
Regarding the potential takes 
associated with auditory impairment, as 
described in the Auditory Injury from 
Sonar Acoustic Sources and Explosives 
and Non-Auditory Injury from 
Explosives section above, any takes in 
the form of TTS are expected to be 
lower-level, of short duration (from 
minutes to, at most, several hours or less 
than a day), and mostly not in a 
frequency band that would be expected 
to interfere with echolocation, overlap 
more than a relatively narrow portion of 
the vocalization range of any single 
species or stock, or preclude detection 
or interpretation of important low- 
frequency cues. Any associated lost 
opportunities or capabilities individuals 
might experience as a result of TTS 
would not be at a level or duration that 
would be expected to impact 
reproductive success or survival. For 
similar reasons, while auditory injury 
impacts last longer, the low anticipated 
levels of AUD INJ that could be 
reasonably expected to result from these 
activities are unlikely to have any effect 
on fitness on the CA/OR/WA stocks of 
goose- and mesoplodont beaked whales 
and the Hawaii stock of Longman’s 
beaked whales. 
Regarding the likely severity of any 
single instance of take by behavioral 
disturbance, as described above, the 
majority of the predicted exposures are 
expected to be below 154 dB SPL and 
last from a few minutes to a few hours, 
at most, with associated responses most 
likely in the form of moving away from 
the source, foraging interruptions, 
vocalization changes, or disruption of 
other social behaviors, lasting from a 
few minutes to several hours. Beaked 
whales are medium-to-large-bodied 
odontocetes with a medium pace of life 
and likely moderately resilient to 
missed foraging opportunities due to 
acoustic disturbance. They are mixed 
breeders (i.e., behaviorally income breeders), and they demonstrate capital 
breeding strategies during gestation and 
lactation (Keen et al., 2021). Therefore, 
they may be more vulnerable to 
prolonged loss of foraging opportunities 
during gestation. Further, as described 
in the Group and Species-Specific 
Analyses section above and the Mitigation Measures section, mitigation 
measures are expected to further reduce 
the potential severity of impacts through 
real-time operational measures that 
minimize higher level/longer duration 
exposures and time/area measures that 
reduce impacts in high value habitat. In 
particular, this rulemaking includes a 
Hawaii Island Marine Mammal 
Mitigation Area, within which the 
Action Proponents must not use more 
than 300 combined hours of MF1 and 
MF1C surface ship hull-mounted MFAS 
or 20 hours of helicopter dipping sonar 
(a MFAS source) annually and must not 
detonate in-water explosives (including 
underwater explosives and explosives 
deployed against surface targets). These 
restrictions will reduce exposure of 
numerous small and resident marine 
mammal populations, including the 
Hawaii stocks of Blainville’s and goose- 
beaked whales, to levels of sound from 
sonar or explosives that have the 
potential to cause injury or mortality, 
thereby reducing the likelihood of those 
effects and, further, minimizing the 
severity of behavioral disturbance. 
As described above, in addition to 
evaluating the anticipated impacts of 
the single instances of takes, it is 
important to understand the degree to 
which individual marine mammals may 
be disturbed repeatedly across multiple 
days of the year. In this case, given the 
number of takes by harassment as 
compared to the stock/species 
abundance (see table 58), it is likely that 
some portion of the individuals taken 
are taken repeatedly over a moderate 
number of days. However, given the 
variety of activity types that contribute 
to take across separate exercises 
conducted at different times and in 
different areas, and the fact that many 
result from transient activities 
conducted at sea, it is unlikely that 
repeated takes would occur clumped 
across sequential days in a manner 
likely to impact foraging success and 
energetics or other behaviors such that 
reproduction or survival of any 
individuals is likely to be impacted. 
Given the magnitude and severity of 
the impacts discussed above to beaked 
whale stock/species (considering annual 
take maxima and the total across 7 
years) and their habitat, and in 
consideration of the required mitigation 
measures and other information 
presented, the Action Proponents’ 
activities are not expected to result in 
impacts on the reproduction or survival 
of any individuals, much less affect 
annual rates of recruitment or survival. 
For these reasons, we have determined 
that the anticipated and authorized take 
will have a negligible impact on the CA/ 
OR/WA stocks of Baird’s, goose-, and 
mesoplodont beaked whales, and the 
Hawaii stocks of Blainville’s, goose-, 
and Longman’s beaked whale stocks. 
Dolphins and Small Whales— 
Of the 39 stocks of dolphins and small 
whales (Delphinidae) for which 
incidental take is authorized (see table 
60), one is listed as endangered under 
the ESA and depleted and strategic 
under the MMPA: the Main Hawaiian 
Islands Insular stock of false killer 
whale. While not ESA-listed, the Hawaii 
Pelagic stock of false killer whale is 
considered strategic under the MMPA. 
As shown in table 60 and table 61, these 
delphinids vary in stock abundance, 
body size, and movement ecology from, 
for example, the small-bodied, nomadic 
CA/OR/WA stock of short-beaked 
common dolphin with NMSDD 
abundance estimate of 1,049,117, to the 
medium-sized small and resident Main 
Hawaiian Islands Insular stock of false 
killer whale with an estimated 
abundance of 138. The HCTT Study 
Area overlaps ESA-designated critical 
habitat for the Main Hawaiian Islands 
Insular stock of false killer whale (83 FR 
35062, July 24, 2018), as well as BIAs 
for the following small and resident 
populations: false killer whale (Main 
Hawaiian Islands Insular and Northwest 
Hawaiian Islands stocks), melon-headed 
whale (Hawaiian Islands and Kohala 
Resident stocks), short-finned pilot 
whale (Hawaii stock), bottlenose 
dolphin (Maui Nui, Hawaii Island, 
Kaua’i/Ni’ihau, and O’ahu stocks), 
pantropical spotted dolphins (Maui Nui, 
Hawaii Island, and O’ahu stocks), 
rough-toothed dolphin (Hawaii stock), 
and spinner dolphin (Hawaii Island, 
Kaua’i/Ni’ihau, and O’ahu/4 Islands 
Region stocks). These areas are 
described in the Description of Marine 
Mammals and Their Habitat in the Area 
of Specified Activities section.

Badger et al. 2025. 59013 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations bottlenose dolphin) to 2,169,554 for the 
CA/OR/WA stock of short-beaked 
common dolphin, with 14 stocks below 
2,000, 5 stocks above 70,000, and the 
remainder between 2,000 and 70,000. 
Take by Level A harassment is 0 for 9 
of the 39 stocks, between 1 and 15 for 
20 stocks, and above 15 for 10 stocks. 
As indicated, the rule also allows for 
take by M/SI for 10 stocks (the CA/OR/ 
WA stocks of short-finned pilot whale, 
northern right whale dolphin, Pacific 
white-sided dolphin, short-beaked 
common dolphin, and striped dolphin; 
the Hawaii Pelagic and O’ahu stocks of 
bottlenose dolphin; the California stock 
of long-beaked common dolphin; the 
Baja California Peninsula Mexico 
population of pantropical spotted 
dolphin; and the Hawaii stock of rough- 
toothed dolphin), the impacts of which 
are discussed above in the Serious 
Injury and Mortality section. The total 
take allowable across all 7 years of the 
rule is indicated in table 19. 
All delphinid stocks are expected to 
incur some number of takes in the form 
of TTS. As described in the Auditory 
Injury from Sonar Acoustic Sources and 
Explosives and Non-Auditory Injury 
from Explosives section above, these 
temporary hearing impacts are expected 
to be lower-level, of short duration 
(from minutes to at most several hours 
or less than a day), and mostly not in 
a frequency band that would be 
expected to interfere with delphinid 
echolocation, overlap more than a 
relatively narrow portion of the 
vocalization range of any single species 
or stock, or preclude detection or 
interpretation of important low- 
frequency cues. Any associated lost 
opportunities or capabilities individuals 
might experience as a result of TTS 
would not be at a level or duration that 
would be expected to impact 
reproductive success or survival. About 
three-quarters of the affected delphinid 
stocks will incur some number of takes 
by AUD INJ, over half of those stocks 
will incur take in the single digits, with 
only 2 stocks exceeding 45 (long- and 
short-beaked common dolphin). For 
reasons similar to those discussed for 
TTS, while auditory injury impacts last 
longer, given the anticipated 
effectiveness of mitigation measures and 
the likelihood that individuals are 
expected to avoid higher levels 
associated with more severe impacts, 
the lower anticipated levels of AUD INJ 
that could be reasonably expected to 
result from these activities are unlikely 
to affect the fitness of any individuals. 
Two stocks are projected to incur 
notably higher numbers of take by AUD 
INJ (128 for the California stock of long- 
beaked common dolphin and 806 for the 
CA/OR/WA stock of short-beaked 
common dolphin) and while the 
conclusions above are still applicable, it 
is further worth noting that these 2 
stocks have relatively large abundances 
and limited annual mortality as 
compared to PBR. The rule also allows 
for a limited number of takes by non- 
auditory injury (1–71) for 19 stocks (less 
than 5 takes for all stocks except for the 
California stock of long-beaked common 
dolphin and the CA/OR/WA stock of 
short-beaked common dolphin). As 
described above in the Auditory Injury 
from Sonar Acoustic Sources and 
Explosives and Non-Auditory Injury 
from Explosives section, given the 
limited number of potential exposures 
and the anticipated effectiveness of the 
mitigation measures in minimizing the 
pressure levels to which any individuals 
are exposed, these non-auditory injuries 
are unlikely to be of a nature or level 
that would impact reproduction or 
survival, with the exception of long- and 
short-beaked common dolphins. 
Due to the larger number of long- and 
short-beaked common dolphin 
individuals predicted to be exposed 
annually to levels associated with non- 
auditory injury (24 and 71, 
respectively), it is more likely that some 
subset of these individuals could 
potentially be injured in a manner that 
would result in them foregoing 
reproduction for a year (up to 4 long- 
beaked and 13 short-beaked common 
dolphins). A year of foregone 
reproduction for a male is generally 
meaningless to population rates unless 
the animal ultimately dies. M/SI have 
been modeled for this activity 
separately, and NMFS does not 
anticipate that these non-auditory 
injuries would result in mortality, for 
young or adults. Neither stock is 
considered depleted or strategic. While 
the population trend of these stocks are 
not known (though the SAR notes that 
the CA/OR/WA stock of short-beaked 
common dolphin is possibly 
increasing), they are not considered 
depleted or strategic, and total annual 
mortality is well below PBR for each 
stock. Importantly, the increase in a 
calving interval by a year would have 
far less of an impact on a population 
rate than a mortality would and, 
accordingly, the number of instances of 
foregone reproduction predicted here 
are not expected to adversely affect this 
stock through effects on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival. 
Regarding the likely severity of any 
single instance of take by behavioral 
disturbance, as described above, the 
majority of the predicted exposures are 
expected to be below 178 dB SPL and 
last from a few minutes to a few hours, 
at most, with associated responses most 
likely in the form of moving away from 
the source, foraging interruptions, 
vocalization changes, or disruption of 
other social behaviors, lasting from a 
few minutes to several hours. 
Delphinids are income breeders with a 
medium pace of life, meaning that while 
they can be sensitive to the 
consequences of disturbances that 
impact foraging during lactation, from a 
population standpoint, they can be 
moderately quick to recover. Further, as 
described in the Group and Species- 
Specific Analyses section (and the 
Mitigation Measures section), mitigation 
measures are expected to further reduce 
the potential severity of impacts through 
real-time operational measures that 
minimize higher level/longer duration 
exposures and time/area measures that 
reduce impacts in higher value habitat. 
As described above, in addition to 
evaluating the anticipated impacts of 
the single instances of takes, it is 
important to understand the degree to 
which individual marine mammals may 
be disturbed repeatedly across multiple 
days of the year. In the case of over half 
of the delphinid stocks (see the 
‘‘Greatest degree any individual 
expected to be taken repeatedly across 
multiple days’’ column in table 60), 
given the low number of takes by 
harassment as compared to the stock/ 
species abundance alone, and also in 
consideration of their nomadic 
movement pattern and whether take is 
concentrated in areas in which animals 
are known to congregate, it is unlikely 
that these individual delphinids would 
be taken on more than a limited number 
of days within a year and, therefore, the 
anticipated behavioral disturbance is 
not expected to affect reproduction or 
survival. In the case of the rest of the 
stocks, given the number of takes by 
harassment as compared to the stock/ 
species abundance, it is likely that some 
portion of the individuals taken are 
taken repeatedly over a small to 
moderate number of days (as indicated 
in the ‘‘Greatest degree any individual 
expected to be taken repeatedly across 
multiple days’’ column in table 60), 
with two stocks (Kaua’i/Ni’ihau and 
O’ahu stocks of bottlenose dolphins) 
likely to be taken over a high number of 
days. However, given the variety of 
activity types that contribute to take 
across separate exercises conducted at 
different times and in different areas, 
and the fact that many result from 
transient activities conducted at sea, for 
all stocks except Kaua’i/Ni’ihau and 
O’ahu stocks of bottlenose dolphins 
(addressed below), it is unlikely that the

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES259014 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 240 / Wednesday, December 17, 2025 / Rules and Regulations anticipated small to moderate number of 
repeated takes for a given individual 
would occur clumped across sequential 
days in a manner likely to impact 
foraging success and energetics or other 
behaviors such that reproduction or 
survival of any individuals are likely to 
be impacted. Further, many of these 
stocks are nomadic and, apart from the 
small resident populations, there are no 
known foraging areas or other areas 
within which delphinids are known to 
congregate for important behaviors, and 
for most stocks, the takes are not 
concentrated within a specific region 
and season. 
Regarding the magnitude of repeated 
takes for the Kaua1i/Ni1ihau and O1ahu 
stocks of bottlenose dolphins, given the 
number of takes by harassment as 
compared to the stock/species 
abundance and the small resident 
populations, it is more likely that some 
number of individuals would 
experience a comparatively higher 
number of repeated takes over a 
potentially fair number of sequential 
days. Due to the higher number of 
repeated takes focused within the 
stocks’ limited ranges, it is thereby more 
likely that a portion of the individuals 
(approximately 50 percent of which 
would be female) could be repeatedly 
interrupted during foraging in a manner 
and amount such that impacts to the 
energy budgets of a limited number of 
females (from either losing feeding 
opportunities or expending considerable 
energy moving away from sound 
sources or finding alternative feeding 
options) could cause them to forego 
reproduction for a year (noting that 
bottlenose dolphin calving intervals are 
typically 3 or more years). Energetic 
impacts to males are generally 
meaningless to population rates unless 
they cause death, and it takes extreme 
energy deficits beyond what would ever 
be likely to result from these activities 
to cause the death of an adult marine 
mammal, male or female. The 
population trends of these stocks are 
unknown, and neither are considered 
depleted or strategic. Importantly, the 
increase in a calving interval by a year 
would have far less of an impact on a 
population rate than a mortality would 
and, accordingly, a limited number of 
instances of foregone reproduction are 
not expected to adversely affect these 
stocks through effects on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival (noting also that 
no mortality is predicted or authorized 
for the Kaua1i/Ni1ihau stock, and 0.14 
annual mortality is authorized for the 
O1ahu stock). Further, of note, use of in- 
water explosives (including underwater 
explosives and explosives deployed 
against surface targets) is prohibited 
within the Hawaii 4-Islands Marine 
Mammal Mitigation Area. This measure 
will prevent exposure of these stocks to 
explosives that have the potential to 
cause injury, mortality or behavioral 
disturbance within that area. Further, 
within the same area, mitigation from 
November 15 to April 15 prohibiting use 
of MF1 surface ship hull-mounted 
MFAS would reduce exposure of these 
stocks to levels of sound that have the 
potential to cause injurious or 
behavioral impacts. 
Given the magnitude and severity of 
the take by harassment discussed above 
and any anticipated habitat impacts, 
and in consideration of the required 
mitigation measures and other 
information presented, the Action 
Proponents’ activities are unlikely to 
result in impacts on the reproduction or 
survival of any individuals of delphinid 
stocks, with the exception of the 10 
stocks for which takes by M/SI are 
predicted and the 1 stock for which an 
increased calving interval could 
potentially occur. Regarding the Kaua1i/ 
Ni1ihau and O1ahu stocks of bottlenose 
dolphins, as described above, we do not 
anticipate the relatively limited number 
of individuals that might be taken over 
repeated days within the year in a 
manner that results in a year of foregone 
reproduction to adversely affect the 
stock through effects on rates of 
recruitment or survival, given the status 
of the stocks. Regarding the CA/OR/WA 
stock of short-finned pilot whale, 
Hawaii Pelagic and O1ahu stocks of 
bottlenose dolphin, California stock of 
long-beaked common dolphin, CA/OR/ 
WA stock of Northern right whale 
dolphin, CA/OR/WA stock of Pacific 
white-sided dolphin, Baja California 
Peninsula Mexico population of 
pantropical spotted dolphin, Hawaii 
stock of rough-toothed dolphin, CA/OR/ 
WA stock of short-beaked common 
dolphin, and CA/OR/WA stock of 
striped dolphin, as described in the 
Serious Injury and Mortality section, 
given the status of the stocks and in 
consideration of other ongoing 
anthropogenic mortality (where known), 
the authorized M/SI would not alone, 
nor in combination with the impacts of 
the take by harassment discussed above 
(which are not expected to impact the 
reproduction or survival of any 
individuals for those stocks), be 
expected to adversely affect rates of 
recruitment and survival. For these 
reasons, we have determined that the 
total take (considering annual maxima 
and across 7 years) anticipated and 
authorized will have a negligible impact 
on all delphinid species and stocks. 
Porpoises— 
Neither Dall’s porpoise nor harbor 
porpoise are listed as endangered or 
threatened under the ESA, and none of 
the porpoise stocks are considered 
depleted or strategic under the MMPA. 
The Navy’s NMSDD estimate for the 
CA/OR/WA stock of Dall’s porpoise is 
61,840, and the stock abundances of 
harbor porpoises range from 3,885 
(Navy’s NMSDD) to 15,303 (SAR). There 
are no UMEs or other factors that cause 
particular concern for this stock. As 
described in the Description of Marine 
Mammals and Their Habitat in the Area 
of the Specified Activities section, the 
HCTT Study Area overlaps two small 
and resident population BIAs for the 
Monterey Bay and Morro Bay stocks of 
harbor porpoise (Calambokidis et al., 
2015). There is no ESA-designated 
critical habitat for Dall’s or harbor 
porpoise as neither species is ESA- 
listed. Dall’s porpoises occur from Baja 
California, Mexico, to the northern 
Bering Sea. They shift their distribution 
southward during cooler-water periods 
on both interannual and seasonal time 
scales. They primarily congregate in 
shelf and slope waters, and decrease 
substantially in waters warmer than 17 
degrees Celsius (°C) (63°F (F)). Harbor porpoises generally have higher 
abundances in shallow waters (less than 
200 m (656 ft)) and near shore, but they 
sometimes move into deeper offshore 
waters. However, this species has no 
overlap with nearshore or offshore areas 
in the SOCAL Range Complex (e.g., San Diego, SOAR) or the southern nearshore 
portions of PMSR (e.g., Port Hueneme). Dall’s and harbor porpoises face several 
chronic anthropogenic and non- 
anthropogenic risk factors, including 
fishing gear, fisheries interactions, and 
ocean noise (including acoustic 
deterrent devices or ‘‘seal bombs’’ in the 
case of harbor porpoises), among others.

maximum allowable take of harbor 
porpoise by Level A and Level B 
harassment are 88 (Morro Bay stock) 
and 9,960 (San Francisco/Russian River 
stock), respectively. No mortality is 
anticipated or authorized. The rule 
allows for a limited number of takes by 
non-auditory injury (two for Dall’s 
porpoise, one for the Morro Bay stock of 
harbor porpoise). As described above, 
given the limited number of potential 
exposures and the anticipated 
effectiveness of the mitigation measures 
in minimizing the pressure levels to 
which any individuals are exposed, 
these injuries are unlikely to impact 
reproduction or survival. The total take 
allowable across all 7 years of the rule 
is indicated in table 19. 
Regarding the potential takes 
associated with auditory impairment, as 
VHF cetaceans, Dall’s and harbor 
porpoises are more susceptible to 
auditory impacts in mid- to high 
frequencies and from explosives than 
other species. As described in the 
Temporary Threshold Shift section 
above, any takes in the form of TTS are 
expected to be lower-level, of short 
duration (even the longest recovering in 
less than a day), and mostly not in a 
frequency band that would be expected 
to interfere with porpoise 
communication or other important 
auditory cues. Any associated lost 
opportunities or capabilities individuals 
might experience as a result of TTS 
would not be at a level or duration that 
would be expected to impact 
reproductive success or survival. For 
similar reasons, while auditory injury 
impacts last longer, the low anticipated 
levels of AUD INJ that could be 
reasonably expected to result from these 
activities are unlikely to have any effect 
on fitness. The rule also allows for a 
limited number of takes by non-auditory 
injury for Dall’s porpoise and the Morro 
Bay stock of harbor porpoise (two and 
one, respectively). As described above 
in the Auditory Injury from Sonar 
Acoustic Sources and Explosives and 
Non-Auditory Injury from Explosives 
section, given the limited number of 
potential exposures and the anticipated 
effectiveness of the mitigation measures 
in minimizing the pressure levels to 
which any individuals are exposed, 
these non-auditory injuries are unlikely 
to be of a nature or level that would 
impact reproduction or survival for 
these stocks. 
Harbor porpoises are more susceptible 
to behavioral disturbance than other 
species. They are highly sensitive to 
many sound sources and generally 
demonstrate strong avoidance of most 
types of acoustic stressors. The 
information currently available 
regarding harbor porpoises suggests a 
very low threshold level of response for 
both captive (Kastelein et al., 2000; 
Kastelein et al., 2005) and wild (Johnston, 2002) animals. Southall et al. 
(2007) concluded that harbor porpoises 
are likely sensitive to a wide range of 
anthropogenic sounds at low received 
levels (approximately 90 to 120 dB). 
Research and observations of harbor 
porpoises for other locations show that 
this species is wary of human activity 
and will display profound avoidance 
behavior for anthropogenic sound 
sources in many situations at levels 
down to 120 dB re 1 mPa (Southall et al., 
2007). Harbor porpoises routinely avoid 
and swim away from large, motorized 
vessels (Barlow, 1988; Evans et al., 
1994; Palka and Hammond, 2001; 
Polacheck and Thorpe, 1990). 
Accordingly, and as described in the 
Estimated Take of Marine Mammals 
section, the threshold for behavioral 
disturbance is lower for harbor 
porpoises, and the number of estimated 
takes is higher, with many occurring at 
lower received levels than other taxa. 
Regarding the likely severity of any 
single instance of take by behavioral 
disturbance, as described above, the 
majority of the predicted exposures are 
expected to be below 154 dB SPL and 
last from a few minutes to a few hours, 
at most. Associated responses would 
likely include avoidance, foraging 
interruptions, vocalization changes, or 
disruption of other social behaviors, 
lasting from a few minutes to several 
hours and not likely to exceed 24 hours. 
As small odontocetes and income 
breeders with a fast pace of life, Dall’s 
and harbor porpoises are less resilient to 
missed foraging opportunities than 
larger odontocetes. Although 
reproduction in populations with a fast 
pace of life is more sensitive to foraging 
disruption, these populations are quick 
to recover. Further, as described in the 
Group and Species-Specific Analyses 
section and the Mitigation Measures 
section, mitigation measures are 
expected to further reduce the potential 
severity of impacts through real-time 
operational measures that minimize 
higher level/longer duration exposures 
and time/area measures that reduce 
impacts in high value habitat. 
As described above, in addition to 
evaluating the anticipated impacts of 
the single instances of takes, it is 
important to understand the degree to 
which individual marine mammals may 
be disturbed repeatedly across multiple 
days of the year. In this case, for the 
Monterey Bay and Morro Bay stocks of 
harbor porpoise, given the number of 
takes by harassment as compared to the 
stock/species abundance (see table 62) 
and the small resident populations, it is 
likely that some portion of the 
individuals taken are taken repeatedly 
over a limited number of days. 
However, given the variety of activity 
types that contribute to take across 
separate exercises conducted at different 
times and in different areas, and the fact 
that many result from transient 
activities conducted at sea, it is unlikely 
that repeated takes would occur either 
in numbers or clumped across 
sequential days in a manner likely to 
impact foraging success and energetics 
or other behaviors such that 
reproduction or survival of any 
individuals is likely to be impacted. 
Given the magnitude and severity of 
the impacts discussed above to Dall’s 
porpoises and harbor porpoises 
(considering annual take maxima and 
the total across 7 years) and their 
habitat, and in consideration of the 
required mitigation measures and other 
information presented, the Action 
Proponents’ activities are unlikely to 
result in impacts on the reproduction or 
survival of any individuals and, 
therefore, unlikely to affect annual rates 
of recruitment or survival. For these 
reasons, we have determined that the 
take by harassment anticipated and 
authorized will have a negligible impact 
on Dall’s porpoise and all four stocks of 
harbor porpoises. 
Pinnipeds 
This section builds on the broader 
discussion above and brings together the 
discussion of the different types and 
amounts of take that different pinniped 
stocks will incur, the applicable 
mitigation for each stock, and the status 
and life history of the stocks to support 
the negligible impact determinations for 
each. We have already described above 
why we believe the incremental 
addition of the moderate number of low- 
level auditory injury takes will not have 
any meaningful effect towards 
inhibiting reproduction or survival. We 
have also described above in this 
section the unlikelihood of any masking 
or habitat impacts having effects that 
would impact the reproduction or 
survival of any of the individual marine 
mammals affected by the Action 
Proponents’ activities. Regarding the 
severity of individual takes by Level B 
harassment by behavioral disturbance 
for pinnipeds, the majority of these 
responses are anticipated to occur at 
received levels below 172 dB, and last 
from a few minutes to a few hours, at 
most, with associated responses most 
likely in the form of moving away from 
the source, foraging interruptions, 
vocalization changes, or disruption of

The Hawaiian monk seal (a NMFS 
Species in the Spotlight) and Guadalupe 
fur seal are listed as endangered and 
threatened, respectively, under the ESA 
and are considered depleted and 
strategic under the MMPA. Northern fur 
seals are not listed as endangered or 
threatened under the ESA, but the 
Eastern Pacific stock is considered 
depleted and strategic under the MMPA. 
The remaining pinniped stocks for 
which incidental take is authorized (see 
table 64) are neither ESA-listed nor 
considered depleted or strategic under 
the MMPA. 
As shown in table 64 and table 65, 
these pinnipeds vary in stock 
abundance and movement ecology from, 
for example, the resident Hawaii stock 
of Hawaiian monk seal with an 
estimated abundance of 1,605 animals 
to the migratory Eastern Pacific stock of 
Northern fur seal with an estimated 
abundance of 612,765 animals. The 
HCTT Study Area overlaps the 
Hawaiian monk seal ESA-designated 
critical habitat (51 FR 16047, April 30, 
1986; 53 FR 18988, May 26, 1988; 80 FR 
50925, August 21, 2015), as described in 
the Description of Marine Mammals and 
Their Habitat in the Area of Specified 
Activities section, and there are no 
known BIAs for pinnipeds that overlap 
the HCTT Study Area. There are no 
UMEs or other factors that cause 
additional concern for these stocks. 
Pinnipeds face a number of chronic 
anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic 
risk factors including fisheries 
interactions, illegal harassment, habitat 
degradation, disease, intentional killing/ 
harassment, chemical contaminants, 
power plant entrainment, vessel strike, 
harmful algal blooms, commercial 
aquaculture, and harassment/ 
disturbance at rookeries. 
As shown in table 64, the maximum 
annual allowable instances of take by 
Level B harassment for pinnipeds ranges 
from 999 (Eastern stock of Steller sea 
lion) to 1,899,749 (U.S. stock of 
California sea lion), with 3 stocks below 
23,000, 5 stocks above 23,000, and 
California sea lion being the only stock 
over 348,000. Take by Level A 
harassment is at or below 12 for 4 
stocks, and above 12 for 4 stocks. As 
described above, given the limited 
number of potential exposures and the 
anticipated effectiveness of the 
mitigation measures in minimizing the 
pressure levels to which any individuals 
are exposed, these injuries are unlikely 
to impact reproduction or survival. No 
mortality is anticipated or authorized 
for any pinniped stocks except the U.S. 
stock of California sea lion, Mexico 
stock of Guadalupe fur seal, and 
California stock of harbor seal. For those 
3 stocks, the rule also allows for up to 
27, 1, and 7 takes by serious injury or 
mortality, respectively, over the course 
of the 7-year rule, the impacts of which 
are discussed above in the Serious 
Injury and Mortality section. The total 
authorized take across all 7 years of the 
rule is indicated in table 19. 
Regarding the potential takes 
associated with auditory impairment, as 
described in the Auditory Injury from 
Sonar Acoustic Sources and Explosives 
and Non-Auditory Injury from 
Explosives section above, any takes in 
the form of TTS are expected to be 
lower-level, of short duration (from 
minutes to, at most, several hours or less 
than a day), and mostly not in a 
frequency band that would be expected 
to interfere with pinniped 
communication or other important 
auditory cues. Any associated lost 
opportunities or capabilities individuals 
might experience as a result of TTS 
would not be at a level or duration that 
would be expected to impact 
reproductive success or survival. For 
similar reasons, while auditory injury 
impacts last longer, the low anticipated 
levels of AUD INJ that could be 
reasonably expected to result from these 
activities are unlikely to have any effect 
on fitness. 
The rule also allows for a limited 
number of takes by non-auditory injury 
(1 to 57) for 7 of the 8 stocks (less than 
5 takes for all stocks except for the U.S. 
stock of California sea lion and 
California stock of harbor seal). As 
described above in the Auditory Injury 
from Sonar Acoustic Sources and 
Explosives and Non-Auditory Injury 
from Explosives section, given the 
limited number of potential exposures 
and the anticipated effectiveness of the 
mitigation measures in minimizing the 
pressure levels to which any individuals 
are exposed, these non-auditory injuries 
are unlikely to be of a nature or level 
that would impact reproduction or 
survival of these stocks, with the 
exception of the U.S. stock of California 
sea lion and California stock of harbor 
seal. 
Due to the larger number of California 
sea lion and California stock of harbor 
seal individuals predicted to be exposed 
annually to levels associated with non- 
auditory injury (57 and 7, respectively), 
it is more likely that some subset of 
these individuals could potentially be 
injured in a manner that would result in 
them foregoing reproduction for a year 
(up to 10 California sea lions and 1 
harbor seal). A year of foregone 
reproduction for a male is generally 
meaningless to population rates unless 
the animal ultimately dies. M/SI have 
been modeled for this activity 
separately, and NMFS does not 
anticipate that these non-auditory 
injuries would result in mortality, for

California sea lion is considered stable. 
While the population trend of the 
California stock of harbor seal is 
decreasing, neither of these stocks are 
considered depleted or strategic, and 
total annual mortality is well below PBR 
for both stocks. Importantly, the 
increase in a pupping interval by a year 
would have far less of an impact on a 
population rate than a mortality would 
and, accordingly, the number of 
instances of foregone reproduction 
predicted here would not be expected to 
adversely affect this stock through 
effects on annual rates of recruitment or 
survival. 
Regarding the likely severity of any 
single instance of take by behavioral 
disturbance, as described above, the 
majority of the predicted exposures are 
expected to be below 172 dB SPL and 
last from a few minutes to a few hours, 
at most, with associated responses most 
likely in the form of moving away from 
the source, foraging interruptions, 
vocalization changes, or disruption of 
other social behaviors, lasting from a 
few minutes to several hours. Pinnipeds 
are small-bodied (or small to medium- 
bodied) income breeders with a fast 
pace of life, but have a relatively lower 
energy requirement for their body size, 
which may moderate any impact due to 
foraging disruption. Further, as 
described in the Group and Species- 
Specific Analyses section above and the 
Mitigation Measures section, mitigation 
measures are expected to further reduce 
the potential severity of impacts through 
real-time operational measures that 
minimize higher level/longer duration 
exposures and time/area measures that 
reduce impacts in high value habitat. In 
particular, this rulemaking includes a 
Hawaii Island Marine Mammal 
Mitigation Area and a Hawaii 4-Islands 
Marine Mammal Mitigation Area which 
will reduce exposure of Hawaiian monk 
seals to levels of sound that have the 
potential to cause injury or behavioral 
impacts, including within a portion of 
Hawaiian monk seal critical habitat. 
As described above, in addition to 
evaluating the anticipated impacts of 
the single instances of takes, it is 
important to understand the degree to 
which individual marine mammals may 
be disturbed repeatedly across multiple 
days of the year. Given the number of 
takes by harassment as compared to the 
stock/species abundance alone (see 
table 64), and also in consideration of 
their movement pattern and whether 
take is concentrated in areas in which 
animals are known to congregate, it is 
unlikely that these individual pinnipeds 
would be taken on more than a limited 
number of days within a year (with the 
exception of California sea lion for 
which some individuals may be taken 
on a limited to moderate number of days 
within a year) and, therefore, the 
anticipated behavioral disturbance is 
not expected to affect reproduction or 
survival. However, given the variety of 
activity types that contribute to take 
across separate exercises conducted at 
different times and in different areas, 
and the fact that many result from 
transient activities conducted at sea, it 
is unlikely that repeated takes would 
occur either in numbers or clumped 
across sequential days in a manner 
likely to impact foraging success and 
energetics or other behaviors such that 
reproduction or survival of any 
individuals is likely to be impacted. 
Further, many of these stocks are 
migratory and apart from the small 
resident populations, there are no 
known foraging areas or other areas 
within which animals are known to 
congregate for important behaviors, and 
for most stocks, the predicted takes are 
not concentrated within a specific 
region and season. 
Given the magnitude and severity of 
the take by harassment discussed above 
and any anticipated habitat impacts, 
and in consideration of the required 
mitigation measures and other 
information presented, the Action 
Proponents’ activities are unlikely to 
result in impacts on the reproduction or 
survival of any individuals of pinniped 
stocks, with the exception of the three 
stocks for which takes by M/SI are 
predicted and the two stocks for which 
an increased pupping interval could 
potentially occur. Regarding the U.S. 
stock of California sea lion and 
California stock of harbor seal, as 
described above, we do not anticipate 
the relatively limited number of 
individuals that might be taken by non- 
auditory injury in a manner that results 
in a year of foregone reproduction to 
adversely affect the stock through effects 
on rates of recruitment or survival, 
given the status of the stocks. Regarding 
the U.S. stock of California sea lion, 
Mexico stock of Guadalupe fur seal, and 
California stock of harbor seal, as 
described in the Serious Injury and 
Mortality section, given the status of the 
stocks and in consideration of other 
ongoing anthropogenic mortality, the 
authorized M/SI take would not alone, 
nor in combination with the impacts of 
the take by harassment discussed above 
(which are not expected to impact the 
reproduction or survival of any 
individuals for those stocks), be 
expected to adversely affect rates of 
recruitment and survival. For these 
reasons, we have determined that the 
total take (considering annual maxima 
and across 7 years) anticipated and 
authorized will have a negligible impact 
on all pinniped species and stocks. 
Determination 
Based on the analysis contained 
herein of the likely effects of the 
specified activities on marine mammals 
and their habitat, and taking into 
consideration the implementation of the 
proposed monitoring and mitigation 
measures, NMFS finds that the total 
marine mammal take from the specified 
activity will have a negligible impact on 
all affected marine mammal species or 
stocks. 
Unmitigable Adverse Impact Analysis 
and Determination 
There are no relevant subsistence uses 
of the affected marine mammal stocks or 
species implicated by this action. 
Therefore, NMFS has determined that 
the total taking of affected species or 
stocks will not have an unmitigable 
adverse impact on the availability of 
such species or stocks for taking for 
subsistence purposes. 
Classification 
Endangered Species Act 
There are 10 marine mammal species 
under NMFS jurisdiction that are listed 
as endangered or threatened under the 
ESA with confirmed or possible 
occurrence in the HCTT Study Area: 
blue whale, fin whale, gray whale, 
humpback whale, sei whale, sperm 
whale, killer whale, false killer whale, 
Guadalupe fur seal, and Hawaiian monk 
seal. The humpback whale (86 FR 
21082, April 21, 2021), killer whale (71 
FR 69054, November 29, 2006; revised 
August 2, 2021 (86 FR 41668)), false 
killer whale (83 FR 35062, July 24, 
2018), and Hawaiian monk seal (51 FR 
16047, April 30, 1986; revised in 1988 
(53 FR 18988, May 26, 1988) and in 
2015 (80 FR 50925, August 21, 2015)) 
have critical habitat designated under 
the ESA in the HCTT Study Area. 
The Action Proponents consulted 
with NMFS pursuant to section 7 of the 
ESA for HCTT activities, and NMFS also 
consulted internally on the 
promulgation of this rule and the 
issuance of LOAs under section 
101(a)(5)(A) of the MMPA. NMFS issued 
a biological and conference opinion 
concluding that the promulgation of the 
rule and issuance of subsequent LOAs 
are not likely to jeopardize the 
continued existence of threatened and 
endangered species under NMFS’ 
jurisdiction and are not likely to result 
in the destruction or adverse 
modification of designated or proposed

National Marine Sanctuaries Act 
Federal agency actions that are likely 
to injure sanctuary resources are subject 
to consultation with NOAA’s Office of 
National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS) 
under section 304(d) of the National 
Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA) (16 
U.S.C. 1431 et seq.). 
On June 3, 2025, NMFS and the 
Action Proponents jointly requested 
consultation with NOAA’s ONMS to 
fulfill our responsibilities under the 
NMSA, as warranted. At that time, 
NMFS and the Action Proponents 
submitted a Sanctuary Resource 
Statement (SRS), as the Action 
Proponents concluded that their 
training and testing activities in the 
HCTT Study Area may incidentally 
expose sanctuary resources that reside 
within Channel Islands NMS, Chumash 
Heritage NMS, Cordell Bank NMS, 
Greater Farallones NMS, Monterey Bay 
NMS, Hawaiian Islands Humpback 
Whale NMS, and Papaha¯naumokua¯kea 
NMS to sound and other environmental 
stressors, and NMFS concluded that 
proposed MMPA regulations and 
associated LOAs that would allow the 
Action Proponents to incidentally take 
marine mammals include a subset of 
those impacts that could occur to NMS 
resources. 
ONMS reviewed the SRS and found 
the SRS sufficient for the purposes of 
making an injury determination and 
developing recommended alternatives 
as required by the NMSA. On 
September 30, 2025, ONMS provided its 
injury determination and five 
recommended alternatives to minimize 
injury and to protect sanctuary 
resources. On October 20, 2025, NMFS 
and the Navy submitted a joint response 
to the ONMS recommended 
alternatives. Consultation under the 
NMSA is now concluded. 
National Environmental Policy Act 
To comply with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and 
NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 
216–6A, NMFS must review our 
proposed actions with respect to 
potential impacts on the human 
environment. NMFS participated as a 
cooperating agency on the 2025 HCTT 
EIS/OEIS, which was made available to 
the public on October 3, 2025 (90 FR 
52660), and is available at: https://
www.nepa.navy.mil/hctteis/. NMFS independently reviewed and evaluated 
the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS and 
determined that it is adequate and 
sufficient to meet our responsibilities 
under NEPA for the issuance of this rule 
and associated LOAs. NOAA therefore, 
has adopted the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS. 
NMFS has prepared a separate Record of 
Decision. NMFS’ Record of Decision for 
adoption of the 2025 HCTT EIS/OEIS 
and issuance of this final rule and 
subsequent LOAs can be found at: 
https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/ 
national/marine-mammal-protection/ 
incidental-take-authorizations-military- 
readiness-activities. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act (RFA), the Chief Counsel for 
Regulation of the Department of 
Commerce has certified to the Chief 
Counsel for Advocacy of the Small 
Business Administration during the 
proposed rule stage that this action 
would not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. The factual basis for the 
certification was published in the 
proposed rule and is not repeated here. 
No comments were received regarding 
this certification. As a result, a 
regulatory flexibility analysis was not 
required and none was prepared. 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
This action does not contain any 
collection of information requirements 
for purposes of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
et seq.). 
Executive Order 12866 
The Office of Management and Budget 
has determined that this rule is not 
significant for purposes of Executive 
Order 12866. 
Executive Order 14192 
This final rule is not an Executive 
Order 14192 regulatory action because 
this rule is not significant under 
Executive Order 12866. 
Waiver of Delay in Effective Date 
NMFS has determined that there is 
good cause under the Administrative 
Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 
553(d)(3)) to waive the 30-day delay in 
the effective date of this final rule. No 
individual or entity other than the 
Action Proponents are affected by the 
provisions of these regulations. The 
Action Proponents have requested that 
this final rule take effect on or before 
December 21, 2025, to accommodate the 
Navy’s LOAs that expire on December 
20, 2025, so as to not cause a disruption 
in training and testing activities. The 
waiver of the 30-day delay of the 
effective date of the final rule will 
ensure that the MMPA final rule and 
LOAs are in place by the time the 
previous authorizations expire. Any 
delay in effectiveness of the final rule 
would result in either: (1) a suspension 
of planned naval training and testing, 
which would disrupt vital training and 
testing essential to national security; or 
(2) the Action Proponents’ procedural 
non-compliance with the MMPA 
(should the Action Proponents conduct 
training and testing without LOAs), 
thereby resulting in the potential for 
unauthorized takes of marine mammals. 
Moreover, the Action Proponents are 
ready to implement the regulations 
immediately. For these reasons, NMFS 
finds good cause to waive the 30-day 
delay in the effective date. In addition, 
the rule authorizes incidental take of 
marine mammals that would otherwise 
be prohibited under the statute. 
Therefore, by granting an exception to 
the Action Proponents, the rule relieves 
restrictions under the MMPA, which 
provides a separate basis for waiving the 
30-day effective date for the rule under 
section 553(d)(1) of the APA.

m), 200 to 500 yd (182.9 to 457.2 m), 
500 to 1,000 yd (457.2 to 914.4 m), 1,000 
to 2,000 yd (914.4 to 1,828.8 m), or 
greater than 2,000 yd (1,828.8 m). 
(J) Lookouts must report the observed 
behavior of the animal(s) in plain 
language and without trying to 
categorize in any way (such as animal 
closing to bow ride, paralleling course/ 
speed, floating on surface and not 
swimming, etc.), including speed and direction and if any calves were present. 
(K) The report must indicate whether 
explosive detonations were delayed, 
ceased, modified, or not modified due to 
marine mammal presence and for how 
long. 
(L) If observation occurred while 
explosives were detonating in the water, 
indicate munition type in use at time of 
marine mammal detection. 
(3) Summary of sources used. This section of the report must include the 
following information summarized from 
the analyzed sound sources used in all 
training and testing events: 
(i) Totals for sonar or other acoustic source bins. Total annual hours or 
quantity (per the LOA) of each bin of 
sonar or other acoustic sources (e.g., pile driving and air gun activities); and 
(ii) Total for explosive bins. Total annual expended/detonated ordnance 
(missiles, bombs, sonobuoys, etc.) for 
each explosive bin. 
(4) San Nicolas Island. The report must summarize activities and 
observations of the San Nicolas Island 
target and missile launch activities for 
the monitoring period. 
(5) Special reporting for geographic mitigation areas. This section of the 
report must contain the following 
information for activities conducted in 
geographic mitigation areas in the HCTT 
Study Area: 
(i) Hawaii humpback whale special reporting mitigation area. The Action 
Proponents must report the total hours 
of MF1 and MF1C surface ship hull- 
mounted mid-frequency active sonar 
used from November through May in 
the mitigation area. 
(ii) California large whale real-time notification mitigation area. The Navy 
must report the date, time and general 
location of the whales when an 
aggregation is first sighted and the total 
number of whales in the aggregation. If 
the whales are identified by species, the 
Navy must report that information as 
well. 
(iii) National security requirement. If an Action Proponent(s) invokes the 
national security requirement described 
in §

218.74(a)(2)(xi), the Action 
Proponent personnel must include 
information about the event in its 
Annual HCTT Training and Testing 
Report. 
(6) Foreign military sonar and explosives. Navy personnel must confirm that foreign military use of 
sonar and explosives, when such 
militaries are participating in a U.S. 
Navy-led exercise or event, combined 
with the Action Proponents’ use of 
sonar and explosives, would not cause 
exceedance of the analyzed levels 
within each NAEMO modeled sonar and 
explosive bin used for estimating 
predicted impacts. 
(g) MTE sonar exercise notification. The Action Proponents must submit to 
NMFS (contact as specified in the 
LOAs) an electronic report within 15 
calendar days after the completion of 
any MTE indicating: 
(1) Location. Location of the exercise; (2) Dates. Beginning and end dates of the exercise; and 
(3) Type. Type of exercise. VerDate Sep<11>2014  19:02 Dec 16, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00231 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\17DER2.SGM 17DER2

(a) To incidentally take marine 
mammals pursuant to this subpart, the 
Action Proponents must apply for and 
obtain LOAs. 
(b) An LOA, unless suspended or 
revoked, may be effective for a period of 
time not to exceed the expiration date 
of this subpart. 
(c) In the event of projected changes 
to the activity or to mitigation, 
monitoring, or reporting measures 
(excluding changes made pursuant to 
the adaptive management provision of 
§ 218.77(c)(1)) required by an LOA, the 
Action Proponent must apply for and 
obtain a modification of the LOA as 
described in § 218.77. 
(d) Each LOA will set forth: 
(1) Permissible methods of incidental 
taking; 
(2) Geographic areas for incidental 
taking; 
(3) Means of effecting the least 
practicable adverse impact (i.e., 
mitigation) on the species and stocks of 
marine mammals and their habitat; and 
(4) Requirements for monitoring and 
reporting. 
(e) Issuance of the LOA(s) must be 
based on a determination that the level 
of taking is consistent with the findings 
made for the total taking allowable 
under the regulations of this subpart. 
(f) Notice of issuance or denial of the 
LOA(s) will be published in the Federal 
Register within 30 days of a determination. 
§ 218.77 Modifications of Letters of 
Authorization. 
(a) An LOA issued under §§ 216.106 
of this chapter and 218.76 for the 
activity identified in § 218.70(c) shall be 
modified, upon request by the Action 
Proponents, provided that: 
(1) The specified activity and 
mitigation, monitoring, and reporting 
measures, as well as the anticipated 
impacts, are the same as those described 
and analyzed for the regulations in this 
subpart (excluding changes made 
pursuant to the adaptive management 
provision in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section); and 
(2) NMFS determines that the 
mitigation, monitoring, and reporting 
measures required by the previous 
LOAs under this subpart were 
implemented. 
(b) For LOA modification requests by 
the applicants that include changes to 
the activity or to the mitigation, 
monitoring, or reporting measures 
(excluding changes made pursuant to 
the adaptive management provision in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section), the 
LOA should be modified provided that: 
(1) NMFS determines that the 
change(s) to the activity or the 
mitigation, monitoring, or reporting do 
not change the findings made for this 
subpart and do not result in more than 
a minor change in the total estimated 
number of takes (or distribution by 
species or stock or years); and 
(2) NMFS may publish a notice of 
proposed modified LOA in the Federal 
Register, including the associated 
analysis of the change, and solicit 
public comment before issuing the LOA. 
(c) An LOA issued under §§ 216.106 
of this chapter and 218.76 for the 
activities identified in § 218.70(c) may 
be modified by NMFS Office of 
Protected Resources under the following 
circumstances: 
(1) After consulting with the Action 
Proponents regarding the practicability 
of the modifications, through adaptive 
management, NMFS may modify 
(including remove, revise, or add to) the 
existing mitigation, monitoring, or 
reporting measures if doing so creates a 
reasonable likelihood of more 
effectively accomplishing the goals of 
the mitigation and monitoring measures 
set forth in this subpart. 
(i) Possible sources of data that could 
contribute to the decision to modify the 
mitigation, monitoring, or reporting 
measures in an LOA include, but are not 
limited to: 
(A) Results from the Action 
Proponents’ monitoring report and 
annual exercise reports from the 
previous year(s); 
(B) Results from other marine 
mammal and/or sound research or 
studies; or 
(C) Any information that reveals 
marine mammals may have been taken 
in a manner, extent, or number not 
authorized by this subpart or 
subsequent LOAs. 
(ii) If, through adaptive management, 
the modifications to the mitigation, 
monitoring, or reporting measures are 
substantial, NMFS shall publish a notice 
of proposed LOA(s) in the Federal 
Register and solicit public comment. (2) If the NMFS Office of Protected 
Resources determines that an emergency 
exists that poses a significant risk to the 
well-being of the species or stocks of 
marine mammals specified in LOAs 
issued pursuant to §§ 216.106 of this 
chapter and 218.76, a LOA may be 
modified without prior notice or 
opportunity for public comment. Notice 
would be published in the Federal 
Register within 30 days of the action. §§ 218.78–218.79 [Reserved]
