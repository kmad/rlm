MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION 
BOARD 
5 CFR Part 1201 
Practices and Procedures 
AGENCY: Merit Systems Protection Board. 
ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board) is amending its 
rules of organization and procedure in 
this part to reflect the closure of its New 
York Field Office, and a change of 
address for its Washington Regional 
Office. 
DATES: This final rule is effective on December 18, 2025. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gina K. Grippando, Clerk of the Board, Merit 
Systems Protection Board, 1615 M 
Street NW, Washington, DC 20419; 
phone: (202) 653–7200; fax: (202) 653– 
7130; or email: mspb@mspb.gov. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 1, 2024, MSPB closed its New 
York Field Office. Appendix II of this 
part is amended to reflect the closure of 
the New York Field Office, and that all 
geographic areas previously served by 
the New York Field Office will now be 
served by the Board’s Northeastern 
Regional Office. 
Effective November 13, 2025, MSPB’s 
Washington Regional Office moved to a 
different location. Appendix II of this 
part is amended to reflect the 
Washington Regional Office’s new 
address. 
The Board is publishing this as a final 
rule pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 1204(h). 
I. Procedural Requirements 
A. Administrative Procedure Act 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), MSPB 
finds that there is good cause to issue 
this final rule without prior notice and 
comment. The notice and comment 
requirements of section 553(b) do not 
apply to interpretive rules, general 
statements of policy, or rules of agency 
organization, procedure, or practice. 
This final rule merely reflects the 
closure of one office within MSPB and 
the physical move of another and thus 
relates solely to agency organization. No 
substantive changes in existing law or 
policy are effected by this amendment. 
Under these circumstances, notice and 
comment rulemaking is unnecessary 
and not required by any public interest. 
Similarly, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
553(d)(3), MSPB finds that there is good 
cause to make this final rule effective 
immediately upon publication. Again, 
this rule merely reflects the closure of 
one office within MSPB and the 
physical move of another. 
B. Regulatory Impact Analysis: 
Executive Order 12866 
The MSPB has determined that this is 
not a significant regulatory action under 
E.O. 12866. Therefore, no regulatory 
impact analysis is required. 
C. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
requires an agency to prepare a 
regulatory flexibility analysis for rules 
unless the agency certifies that the rule 
will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. The RFA applies only to rules 
for which an agency is required to first 
publish a proposed rule. See 5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a). As discussed above, 
notice and comment rulemaking is 
unnecessary for this change due to the 
lack of any substantive change to 
existing law or policy. Thus, the RFA 
does not apply to this final rule. 
D. Paperwork Reduction Act 
This document does not contain 
information collection requirements 
subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995, Public Law 104–13 (44 U.S.C. 
Chapter 35). 
E. Congressional Review Act 
Pursuant to the Congressional Review 
Act (5 U.S.C. 801, et seq.), the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs 
designated this rule as not a ‘‘major 
rule’’ as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

FEDERAL RETIREMENT THRIFT 
INVESTMENT BOARD 
5 CFR Part 1655 
RIN 322–AA01 
Curing Missed Loan Payments 
AGENCY: Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. 
ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) amends its 
regulations regarding the methods 
available to participants to cure missed 
loan payments. This final rule will 
permit resumed payroll deductions for 
TSP loans to automatically apply to 
missed payments, giving participants 
more flexibility to cure missed 
payments. 
DATES: The effective date is December 18, 2025. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For press inquiries: James Kaplan at (202) 
809–2625. For information about this final rule: Elizabeth Harris at (202) 942– 
1600. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FRTIB administers the TSP, which was 
established by the Federal Employees’ 
Retirement System Act of 1986 
(FERSA), Public Law 99–335, 100 Stat. 
514. The TSP is a retirement savings 
plan for Federal civilian employees and 
members of the uniformed services. It is 
similar to cash or deferred arrangements 
established for private-sector employees 
under section 401(k) of the Internal 
Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 401(k)). The 
provisions of FERSA that govern the 
TSP are codified, as amended, largely at 
5 U.S.C. 8351 and 8401–80. 
I. Background 
When a TSP participant who is 
employed by the federal government has 
an outstanding loan from their TSP 
account, their loan payments are 
automatically made via payroll 
deductions. Loan payments might be 
missed if payroll deductions are 
interrupted due to a temporary change 
in payroll status, a transfer to another 
federal agency with a different pay 
schedule, or other circumstances. When 
that happens, the participant must make 
up the missed payment within a certain 
period of time called a cure period. 
In the past, if a participant’s payroll 
deductions were interrupted, they were 
required to make up the missed 
payment via personal check, money 
order, or direct debit. When their 
payroll deductions restarted, those 
resumed payments only counted for that 
current month, not for the month that 
was missed. For example, if a 
participant missed a June payment, but 
payroll deductions resumed in July, the 
July deduction would only cover July’s 
payment. The participant would still 
owe June’s payment, and if they did not 
make a payment via personal check, 
money order, or direct debit by the end 
of the cure period, the IRS would treat 
the loan as in default. 
This final rule amends Title 5, Part 
1655 of the Code of Federal Regulations 
to make the loan payment process more 
flexible. Now, when payroll deductions 
resume after an interruption, the first 
deduction will apply to the missed 
payment. The next regularly scheduled 
deduction will then be considered as 
the next required payment. In the 
example above, the July deduction 
would apply to June payment, the 
August deduction would apply to the 
July payment, and so on. This 
effectively shifts the schedule forward 
by one month on a rolling basis and 
gives the participant extra time to make 
up any missed payments before a 
default occurs. This cycle continues, 
with each new payment covering the 
prior missed one, so the participant 
remains one payment behind. This cycle 
continues until (1) a one-time make up 
payment is made via personal check, 
money order, or direct debit, (2) a 
default is triggered because the loan has 
reached its maximum term, or (3) a 
default is triggered because additional 
payments are missed. This gives the 
participant flexibility on when to make 
up a missed payment, but it does not 
extend the term of loan. 
II. Response to Public Comments 
On May 12, 2025, the FRTIB 
published a proposed rule to amend its 
regulations (90 FR 20132, May 12, 
2025). We received five comments. One 
comment was outside the scope of this 
rule, three comments supported the 
proposed rule, and one comment 
identified minor grammatical changes 
intended to improve the clarity of the 
rule. We have adopted the 
recommended grammatical changes. 
In addition to supporting the 
proposed rule, one commentor 
recommended clarifying that the TSP’s 
cure period aligns with the maximum 
timeframe allowable under the Internal 
Revenue Code. In response, we have 
amended the definition of ‘‘cure period’’ 
in section 1655.1. The term ‘‘cure 
period’’ is now defined by reference to 
the maximum timeframe allowable 
under Treasury Regulation § 1.72(p)–1. 
For the reasons described above, the 
FRTIB is adopting the proposed rule as 
final, without substantive change. The 
final rule differs from the proposed rule 
only in minor edits intended to improve 
clarity. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
This regulation will not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
This regulation will affect Federal 
employees and members of the 
uniformed services who participate in 
the Thrift Savings Plan, which is a 
Federal defined contribution retirement 
savings plan created under the Federal 
Employees’ Retirement System Act of 
1986 (FERSA), Public Law 99–335, 100 
Stat. 514, and which is administered by 
the FRTIB. 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
This final regulation does not require 
additional reporting under the criteria of 
the Paperwork Reduction Act. 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 
1995 
Pursuant to the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 602, 632, 
653, and 1501–1571, the effects of this 
regulation on State, local, and Tribal 
governments and the private sector have 
been assessed. This regulation will not 
compel the expenditure in any one year 
of $100 million or more by State, local, 
and Tribal governments, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector. 
Therefore, a statement under 2 U.S.C. 
1532 is not required. 
Submission to Congress and the 
General Accountability Office 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 801(a)(1)(A), the 
FRTIB submitted a report containing 
this rule and other required information 
to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of 
Representatives, and the Government 
Accountability Office before publication 
of this rule in the Federal Register. This 
rule is not a major rule as defined at 5 
U.S.C. 804(2).

Government service, if a payment is not 
made when due, the TSP record keeper 
will notify the participant of the missed 
payment. 
(1) Making up the missed payment. The participant may make up the 
missed payment using one of the 
following methods: 
(i) A personal check, 
(ii) Guaranteed funds, or 
(iii) Direct debit. 
(2) Deemed distribution. If the participant has not made a payment in 
accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section and has not resumed payroll 
deductions by the end of the cure period 
described in § 1655.1, the TSP record 
keeper will declare the loan to be a 
deemed distribution in accordance with 
§ 1655.15(a). 
(3) Resuming payroll deductions. When payroll deductions resume, the 
first deduction shall be applied to the 
earliest missed payment. Each 
subsequent regularly scheduled 
deduction shall be applied to the next 
missed payment. This process shall 
continue on a rolling basis, such that the 
participant remains behind in payments 
until: 
(i) A make up payment is submitted 
for each missed payment in accordance 
with paragraph (e)(1) of this section; 
(ii) The loan reaches its maximum 
term and a deemed distribution of the 
remaining missed payment(s) is 
declared under § 1655.15(a); or 
(iii) Additional missed payments 
trigger a deemed distribution under 
§ 1655.15(a). 
* * * * * 
(g) * * * If the participant does not 
make up all missed payments by the 
end of the cure period described in 
§ 1655,1, the TSP record keeper will 
declare the outstanding loan balance 
and accrued interest to be a loan offset 
in accordance with § 1655.15(b).

I. Discussion 
We are adopting amendments to 
correct errors and to address outdated 
references in certain Commission rules 
and Form N–CEN. Specifically, we are 
adopting amendments to rule 498 under 
the Securities Act to update the 
definition of ‘‘exchange-traded fund’’ to 
provide additional specificity in light of 
subsequent Commission action, and to 
remove outdated requirements that have 
been rendered moot by subsequent 
Commission action. We are also 
adopting amendments to correct 
erroneous or outdated cross-references 
in rules 0–10, 30e–2, and 35d–1 under 
the Investment Company Act, as well as 
in Form N–CEN. 
A. Rule 498 
We are adopting amendments to 
address outdated references in rule 498. 
Open-end management investment 
companies (‘‘open-end funds’’) may 
choose to rely on rule 498 to use a 
summary prospectus to satisfy their 
prospectus delivery obligations under 
certain conditions.

direct reference to rule 6c–11. This 
amendment will result in specificity to 
the particular exemptive rule for ETFs 
that the Commission has adopted, 
compared to a more-general reference. 
We are also adopting amendments to 
remove outdated requirements in rule 
498, which have been rendered moot by 
subsequent Commission action. Rule 
498 includes requirements for a legend 
that must appear on the cover page or 
at the beginning of a summary 
prospectus.
5
Among other things, these 
legend requirements specify that, if a 
fund relies on rule 30e–3 under the Act 
to transmit a report to shareholders, the 
legend must also include the website 
address where the report is available. In 
2022, the Commission adopted 
amendments to rule 30e–3 that exclude 
open-end funds from the scope of the 
rule.
6
These amendments were effective 
on July 24, 2024 (18 months following 
the amendments’ effective date of 
January 24, 2023).
7
Rule 498 applies 
only to open-end funds. As a result, no 
funds that use summary prospectuses 
under rule 498 are currently relying on 
rule 30e–3 to transmit shareholder 
reports, and therefore the language in 
the rule 498 legend requirements that 
references rule 30e–3 is moot. We are 
therefore removing this language from 
the legend requirements of rule 498.
8
 
Language about notices to 
shareholders provided by funds that are 
relying on rule 30e–3 also appears in 
rule 498’s ‘‘greater prominence’’ 
requirements.
9
Specifically, for funds 
that use summary prospectuses, the 
fund’s summary prospectus must be 
given greater prominence than any 
materials that accompany the summary 
prospectus, with certain exceptions 
(including the notice to shareholders 
provided under rule 30e–3). The 
language in the ‘‘greater prominence’’ 
requirements that references rule 30e–3 
is moot, and therefore we are removing 
this language from the ‘‘greater 
prominence’’ requirements of rule 
498.
10
 
B. Rule 0–11 
We are adopting amendments to 
correct an outdated cross-reference in 
rule 0–11 under the Investment 
Company Act. Rule 0–11, ‘‘Customer 
identification programs,’’ references the 
requirements of 31 U.S.C. 5318(l) and 
the implementing regulation 
thereunder. Rule 0–11 currently refers, 
in multiple locations, to the 
implementing regulation as ‘‘31 CFR 
103.131’’ and ‘‘31 CFR part 103.’’ These 
citations to the implementing regulation 
are outdated. In 2010, the Financial 
Crimes Enforcement Network 
(‘‘FinCEN’’) issued a final rule to move 
the Bank Secrecy Act regulations to a 
new chapter in the Code of Federal 
Regulations.
11
At the time, the 
Commission did not make conforming 
edits to rule 0–11 to reflect updated 
references. The amendments we are 
adopting make these conforming edits. 
C. Rule 30e–2 
We are adopting amendments to 
correct an erroneous cross-reference in 
rule 30e–2 under the Investment 
Company Act. Rule 30e–2 requires 
registered unit investment trusts that 
invest substantially all of their assets in 
shares of a management investment 
company to send their unitholders 
annual and semiannual reports 
containing financial information on the 
underlying company. Paragraph (a) of 
this rule refers to this requirement by 
referencing rule 30e–1 under the 
Investment Company Act, which 
provides requirements for reports to 
stockholders of management companies. 
However, one of the references in this 
paragraph also erroneously refers to rule 
30d–1 under the Act, which provides 
requirements for filing copies of reports 
to shareholders with the Commission 
(as opposed to rule 30e–1, which 
addresses the information to be 
included in such reports and other 
requirements necessary to satisfy 
obligations under section 30(e) of the 
Act).
12
We are changing this erroneous 
reference instead to refer to rule 30e–1. 
D. Rule 35d–1 
We are adopting amendments to 
correct an erroneous cross-reference in 
rule 35d–1 under the Investment 
Company Act. Rule 35d–1 addresses the 
names of registered investment 
companies and business development 
companies that the Commission defines 
as materially misleading or deceptive. In 
2023, the Commission adopted 
amendments to rule 35d–1 that, among 
other things, modernize the 
requirements for certain notices to 
shareholders that must be sent under 
the rule.
13
These requirements are set 
forth in paragraph (d) of rule 35d–1, as 
amended. Instead of referring to 
paragraph (d), an earlier paragraph of 
rule 35d–1, which references the notice 
requirements under the rule, 
erroneously refers to paragraph (e).
14
 
We are changing this erroneous 
reference instead to refer to paragraph 
(d). 
E. Form N–CEN 
We are adopting amendments to 
correct an outdated citation in Form N– 
CEN. Item C.12.a of Form N–CEN 
requires Form N–CEN filers to provide 
certain information about each person 
that provided custodial services during 
the reporting period. With respect to the 
custodian, Item C.12.a.vii requires the 
filer to check a box indicating the type 
of custody (e.g., bank, member national securities exchange, self custody, etc.). 
One option that a filer may check under 
this item is ‘‘insurance company 
sponsor,’’ which includes as a citation 
‘‘rule 26a–2 (17 CFR 270.26a–2).’’ In 
2020, the Commission adopted 
amendments to—and also rescinded— 
certain rules governing variable life 
insurance contracts and variable 
annuity contracts as a result of the 
enactment of the National Securities 
Market Improvement Act of 1996 
(‘‘NSMIA’’), which modified Investment

These 
amendments and rescissions reflected 
that these rules no longer followed 
statutory requirements.

The 
Commission rescinded rule 26a–2 at 
that time, as NSMIA added Investment 
Company Act section 26(e) (later 
renumbered as section 26(f)), which 
codified those parts of rule 26a–2 that 
permit an insurance company to 
maintain custody of separate account 
assets. The Commission did not, 
however, make a conforming edit to 
Form N–CEN at that time to remove the 
reference to rule 26a–2 and replace it 
with a reference to section 26(f). The 
amendments we are adopting make this 
conforming edit. 
Statutory Authority 
The Commission is adopting these 
amendments under the authority set 
forth in the Securities Act, particularly 
sections 5, 6, 7, 10, and 19 thereof [15 
U.S.C. 77a et seq.] and the Investment

* * * * * 
2. Amend § 230.498 by revising 
paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(1)(v)(A), and (f)(2) 
to read as follows:

open-end management investment 
companies.

website address, other than the address 
of the Commission’s electronic filing 
system; toll free (or collect) telephone

Prospectus and other information. The 
website address must be specific enough 
to lead investors directly to the 
Statutory Prospectus and other materials 
that are required to be accessible under 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, rather 
than to the home page or other section 
of the website on which the materials 
are posted. The website could be a 
central site with prominent links to each 
document. The legend may indicate, if 
applicable, that the Statutory Prospectus

programs. 
Each registered open-end company is 
subject to the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 
5318(l) and the implementing regulation

Where 31 CFR 1024.220 and this 
chapter require the same records to be 
preserved for different periods of time, 
such records shall be preserved for the 
longer period of time. 
5. Amend § 270.30e–2 by revising 
paragraph (a) to read as follows: 
§ 270.30e–2 Reports to shareholders of 
unit investment trusts. 
(a) At least semiannually every 
registered unit investment trust 
substantially all the assets of which 
consist of securities issued by a 
management company must transmit to

AGENCY: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
ACTION: Direct final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission is partially rescinding a direct final rule that 
inserted a conditional sunset date into 
certain regulations. The Commission is 
rescinding the sunset provision from 
one regulation because it received a 
significant adverse comment in 
response to an identical proposed rule 
which was published concurrently with 
the direct final rule. 
DATES: This rule is effective January 20, 2026.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
1. In the Direct Final Rule
1
(90 FR 
48397, October 21, 2025), the 
Commission stated that if any 
significant adverse comments are 
received on any part of the Direct Final 
Rule, the Commission will publish a 
document that rescinds any such part of 
this action and will address the 
comments received in a subsequent 
final rule as a response to the 
companion proposed rule. 
2. The Commission received a 
significant adverse comment on the 
amendment to insert a conditional 
sunset provision in 18 CFR 2.27 
(Availability of North American Energy 
Standards Board (NAESB) Smart Grid 
Standards as non-mandatory guidance); 
therefore, the Commission is rescinding 
that amendment to 18 CFR 2.27. 
3. As stated in the Direct Final Rule, 
the Commission will address the 
comment received on the companion 
proposed rule in a subsequent final rule. 
The Commission will not initiate a 
second comment period on this action.

AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. 
ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document contains final regulations regarding the base erosion 
and anti-abuse tax imposed on certain 
large corporate taxpayers with respect to 
certain payments made to foreign 
related parties. The final regulations 
relate to how qualified derivative 
payments with respect to securities 
lending transactions are determined and 
reported. The final regulations affect 
corporations with substantial gross 
receipts that make payments to foreign 
related parties. 
DATES: 
Effective date: The final regulations 
are effective December 17, 2025. 
Applicability dates: For dates of 
applicability, see §§ 1.59A–10 and 1.6038A–2(g).

This document contains additions 
and amendments to 26 CFR part 1 
(Income Tax Regulations) under 
sections 59A and 6038A of the Internal 
Revenue Code (Code) (‘‘the final 
regulations’’). The additions and 
amendments are issued pursuant to the 
express delegations of authority to the 
Secretary of the Treasury (or his 
delegate) provided under sections 
59A(i) and 6038A(b)(2). The final 
regulations are also issued under the

section 7805(a) of the Code.

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES159047 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Rules and Regulations 6038A. The base erosion and anti-abuse 
tax (‘‘BEAT’’) of section 59A imposes on 
each applicable taxpayer a tax equal to 
the base erosion minimum tax amount 
for the taxable year, which is the excess 
of a specified percentage of the modified 
taxable income of the applicable 
taxpayer minus the applicable 
taxpayer’s regular tax liability under 
section 26(b) of the Code reduced (but 
not below zero) by certain credits. See 
section 59A(b)(1) and (2). 
The applicable taxpayer determines 
its modified taxable income by 
computing its taxable income without 
regard to any base erosion tax benefit 
with respect to any base erosion 
payment or the base erosion percentage 
of any net operating loss deduction 
allowed under section 172 of the Code 
for the taxable year. See section 59A(c)(1). Generally, a base erosion 
payment is any deductible amount paid 
or accrued by an applicable taxpayer to 
a foreign person (as defined in section 
6038A(c)(3)) that is a related party of the 
applicable taxpayer and the base erosion 
tax benefit is the deduction allowed 
under Chapter 1 of the Code for the 
taxable year for the base erosion 
payment. See section 59A(d)(1), (c)(2) and (f). Qualified derivative payments 
(‘‘QDPs’’), as defined in section 
59A(h)(2)(A), are not treated as base 
erosion payments if they are properly 
reported to the IRS. See section 59A(h)(1) and (h)(2)(B). 
On January 10, 2025, the Treasury 
Department and the IRS published 
proposed regulations under sections 
59A and 6038A (REG–107895–24) in the 
Federal Register (90 FR 3085). The 
proposed regulations would address 
how taxpayers determine and report 
qualified derivative payment amounts 
with respect to securities lending 
transactions. Two comments were 
submitted in response to the proposed 
regulations, but only one of those 
comments addressed the proposed 
regulations. The Summary of Comments 
and Explanation of Revisions section of 
this preamble discusses this comment. 
All written comments received in 
response to the proposed regulations are 
available at https:www.regulations.gov 
or upon request. A public hearing on the 
proposed regulations was not held 
because there were no requests to speak. 
Summary of Comments and 
Explanation of Revisions 
Proposed § 1.59A–6(b)(3)(iii)(A) 
would provide that mark-to-market 
gains and losses from the securities leg 
of an intercompany securities lending 
transaction are not treated as QDPs. As 
proposed, taxpayers would not be 
required to include those amounts in 
their QDP reporting. A conforming 
amendment in proposed § 1.59A– 
3(b)(2)(iv) would provide that mark-to- 
market gains and losses from the 
securities leg of a securities lending 
transaction are not taken into account 
when determining the amount of a 
taxpayer’s base erosion payment. 
Proposed § 1.59A–6(b)(3)(iv) would 
provide rules for determining whether a 
taxpayer made a substitute payment or 
other payment pursuant to a securities 
lending transaction to a foreign related 
party. Specifically, the rule would 
provide that a taxpayer may determine 
the amount of a substitute payment or 
other payment that it has paid to a 
foreign related party by using the 
amount actually paid by the taxpayer to 
the foreign related party if the taxpayer 
can specifically identify each recipient 
of the substitute payment or other 
payment. If the taxpayer cannot 
determine the recipient of those 
payments, the rule would provide a 
method that treats the substitute 
payments or other payments that a 
taxpayer pays with respect to borrowed 
securities as having been paid first to 
foreign related parties (but not in excess 
of the total amount of the payments 
received by the foreign related parties 
from all payors). 
The comment recommended that the 
final regulations provide definitions for 
terms used in the regulations such as 
‘‘qualified derivative payment,’’ 
‘‘substitute payment,’’ ‘‘other amounts 
that relate to the securities lending 
transaction,’’ ‘‘mark-to-market gains and 
losses,’’ ‘‘securities leg of a securities 
lending transaction,’’ and ‘‘cash 
collateral’’ to reduce ambiguity. The 
comment asserted that the ambiguity 
could potentially lead to substitute 
payments being misclassified as QDPs 
rather than base erosion payments. The 
comment also requested additional 
examples illustrating the classification 
of substitute payments. 
In response to this comment, the final 
regulations include cross-references to 
§§ 1.861–2(a)(7) and 1.861–3(a)(6) to 
clarify the meaning of the term 
‘‘substitute payment.’’ 
Although proposed § 1.59A– 
3(b)(2)(iv)(B) indicates by exclusion that 
‘‘other amounts that relate to the 
securities lending transaction’’ refers to 
payments relating to the transaction 
other than mark-to-market gains or 
losses and the delivery of securities to 
or receipt of securities from the lender, 
greater clarity that substitute payments 
and borrow fees are included in this 
term may be helpful. Therefore, for 
consistency purposes, §§ 1.59A– 
3(b)(2)(iv)(B) and 1.59A–6(b)(3)(iii) of 
the final regulations have been modified 
to use the term ‘‘items of income, gain, 
loss, or deduction during the taxable 
year’’ and explain that this term refers 
to amounts such as substitute payments 
and borrow fees that relate to the 
securities lending transaction and does 
not include the delivery or receipt of 
securities. The final regulations also 
clarify that the term ‘‘mark-to-market 
gains and losses’’ with respect to a 
securities lending transaction refers to 
the recognition of gain or loss on the 
transaction as if the taxpayer’s position 
in the securities lending position were 
sold for its fair market value on the last 
business day of the taxable year, as 
described in § 1.59A–6(b)(1)(i). 
Proposed § 1.59A–6(b)(3)(iii) would 
provide cross-references to §§ 1.861– 
2(a)(7) and 1.861–3(a)(6) for the 
definition of a ‘‘securities lending 
transaction.’’ Sections 1.861–2(a)(7) and 
1.861–3(a)(6) define the term ‘‘securities 
lending transaction’’ as ‘‘a transfer of 
one or more securities that is described 
in section 1058(a) or a substantially 
similar transaction.’’ These cross- 
references were intended to indicate 
that ‘‘securities leg of a securities 
lending transaction’’ refers to the 
components of the transaction that 
relate to the transfer of a security. The 
final regulations have been modified to 
clarify that the securities leg of a 
securities lending transaction refers to 
the rights, obligations, and transfers of 
securities and payments under the 
transaction other than the obligation to 
provide or right to receive cash 
collateral and interest (sometimes 
referred to as rebate) thereon. 
Some of the terms cited by the 
comment are already defined in other 
parts of the regulations or are commonly 
understood industry terms. For 
example, the term ‘‘qualified derivative 
payment’’ is defined in section 
59A(h)(2)(A) and § 1.59A–6(b); 
therefore, no additional definition is 
required. Additionally, ‘‘cash collateral’’ 
is a commonly understood industry 
term that does not require a definition 
and is already used in the existing 
regulations at § 1.59A–6(d)(2)(iii)(B). 
The final regulations do not adopt the 
comment to include examples 
illustrating the classification of 
substitute payments. The Treasury 
Department and IRS are of the view that 
additional examples would not add 
clarity because the final regulations now 
cross-reference regulations illustrating 
the meaning of a substitute payment, 
and the examples in proposed § 1.59A– 
6(b)(3)(iii)(B) clearly indicate the types 
of payments that are referenced by the 
term ‘‘substitute payment.’’ 
The final regulations also make 
clarifying edits to the specific

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES159048 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Rules and Regulations identification method in proposed 
§ 1.59A–6(b)(3)(iv)(B). As noted 
previously, the proposed regulations 
would have provided that a taxpayer 
may determine the amount of substitute 
payments or other payments with 
respect to the securities leg of a 
securities lending transaction that it has 
paid to a foreign related party by using 
the amount actually paid by the 
taxpayer to the foreign related party if 
the taxpayer can specifically identify 
each recipient of the substitute payment 
or other payment. This proposed rule 
was intended to be available to a 
taxpayer only if the taxpayer is able to 
identify all of the recipients of the 
substitute payments and other payments 
that taxpayer made with respect to the 
securities leg of a securities lending 
transaction during the taxable year. The 
final regulations clarify this rule and 
expand the situations when a taxpayer 
may use the specific identification 
method. Specifically, a taxpayer may 
use the specific identification method of 
§ 1.59A–6(b)(3)(iv)(B) to determine the 
amount of the substitute payments or 
other payments with respect to the 
securities leg of a securities lending 
transaction that it has paid to foreign 
related parties only if the taxpayer can 
specifically identify all recipients of the 
substitute payments or other payments 
paid by the taxpayer or the taxpayer can 
specifically identify the payor for all 
substitute payments or other payments 
with respect to the securities leg of a 
securities lending transaction received 
by foreign related parties. If a taxpayer 
has paid any substitute payment or 
other payment for which it cannot 
determine the recipient and cannot 
specifically identify the payor for all 
substitute payments received by foreign 
related parties, the final regulations 
provide that the taxpayer must use the 
alternative method provided in § 1.59A– 
6(b)(3)(iv)(C). 
The comment also recommended that 
the final regulations provide additional 
clarifying examples illustrating mark-to- 
market adjustments and the operation of 
the allocation method of proposed 
§ 1.59A–6(b)(3)(iv). The Treasury 
Department and the IRS consider the 
examples that were provided in 
proposed § 1.59A–6(b)(3)(iii)(B) to be 
sufficiently illustrative of the mechanics 
of mark-to-market adjustments; 
therefore, the clarity of these rules will 
not be improved by adding additional 
examples in the final regulations. The 
Treasury Department and the IRS agree, 
however, that an example illustrating 
the allocation method would be helpful. 
Therefore, the final regulations include 
an example of the allocation method in 
§ 1.59A–6(b)(3)(iv)(D). 
Finally, the comment requested 
additional transition relief with respect 
to the reporting requirements of 
§ 1.6038A–2(b)(7)(ix) such as a two-year 
phased implementation. The comment 
suggested that in the first phase, the IRS 
could adopt reduced reporting 
requirements or grant safe harbor 
treatment for systems unable to capture 
detailed data immediately to allow time 
for internal systems upgrades and 
process testing before requiring full 
compliance. As an alternative, the 
comment suggested permitting 
taxpayers to submit evidence of system 
limitations as the basis for temporary 
relief, while establishing clear 
compliance milestones. The final 
regulations do not adopt this comment. 
Instead, the final regulations retain the 
transition relief provided in the 
proposed regulations, which delays the 
applicability date of § 1.6038A– 
2(b)(7)(ix). The rules relating to QDP 
reporting apply to payments made in 
taxable years beginning on or after 
January 1, 2027. It is expected that this 
delayed applicability date will give 
taxpayers sufficient time to build and 
update the systems needed to track 
QDPs. 
Applicability Date 
The preamble to the proposed 
regulation explained that proposed 
§§ 1.59A–3(b)(2)(iv) (application of 
BEAT netting rule to securities lending 
transactions) and 1.59A–6(b)(3)(ii) 
through (iv) (QDP rules relating to 
securities lending transactions) would 
apply to taxable years beginning on or 
after the date that final regulations are 
filed with the Federal Register. The text 
of proposed § 1.59A–10(c), however, 
mistakenly provided that proposed 
§§ 1.59A–3(b)(2)(iv) and 1.59A– 
6(b)(3)(iii) and (iv) would apply to 
taxable years beginning on or after 
January 10, 2025, which was the date 
that the proposed regulations were filed 
with the Federal Register. Consistent 
with the preamble to the proposed 
regulations, the final regulations 
provide that §§ 1.59A–3(b)(2)(iv) and 
1.59A–6(b)(3)(iii) and (iv) apply to 
taxable years beginning on or after 
December 17, 2025. However, taxpayers 
may choose to apply these final rules to 
a taxable year beginning on or after 
January 10, 2025, and before December 
17, 2025. Section 1.6038A–2(b)(7)(ix) 
(rules relating to QDP reporting) applies 
to payments made in taxable years 
beginning on or after January 1, 2027. 
Special Analysis 
I. Regulatory Planning and Review— 
Economic Analysis 
These final regulations are not subject 
to review under section 6(b) of 
Executive Order 12866 pursuant to the 
Memorandum of Agreement (July 4, 
2025) between the Treasury Department 
and the Office of Management and 
Budget regarding review of tax 
regulations. 
II. Paperwork Reduction Act 
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(44 U.S.C. 3501–3520) (PRA) generally 
requires that a Federal agency obtain the 
approval of the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) before collecting 
information from the public, whether 
such collection of information is 
mandatory, voluntary, or required to 
obtain or retain a benefit. An agency 
may not conduct or sponsor, and a 
person is not required to respond to, a 
collection of information unless it 
displays a valid control number 
assigned by the Office of Management 
and Budget. These final regulations do 
not create or impose any additional 
information collection requirements in 
the form of reporting, recordkeeping 
requirements, or third-party disclosure 
statements. The collection requirements 
are within Form 8991 and its 
instructions which are included in the 
OMB Control Number 1545–0123. 
III. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
Generally, the final regulations affect 
only aggregate groups of corporations 
with average annual gross receipts of at 
least $500 million and that make 
payments to foreign related parties. 
Generally, only large businesses have 
both substantial gross receipts and make 
payments to foreign related parties. In 
accordance with the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) the 
Secretary hereby certifies that these 
final regulations will not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility 
analysis under the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act is not required. 
IV. Section 7805(f) 
Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the 
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking 
was submitted to the Chief Counsel for 
Advocacy of the Small Business 
Administration for comment on their 
impact on small business, and no 
comments were received.

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES159049 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Rules and Regulations that agencies assess anticipated costs 
and benefits and take certain other 
actions before issuing a final rule that 
includes any Federal mandate that may 
result in expenditures in any one year 
by a State, local, or Tribal government, 
in the aggregate, or by the private sector, 
of $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated 
annually for inflation. The final 
regulations do not include any Federal 
mandate that may result in expenditures 
by State, local, or Tribal governments, or 
by the private sector in excess of that 
threshold. 
VI. Executive Order 13132: Federalism 
Executive Order 13132 (entitled 
‘‘Federalism’’) prohibits an agency from 
publishing any rule that has federalism 
implications if the rule either imposes 
substantial, direct compliance costs on 
State and local governments, and is not 
required by statute, or preempts State 
law, unless the agency meets the 
consultation and funding requirements 
of section 6 of the Executive order. The 
final regulations do not have federalism 
implications and do not impose 
substantial direct compliance costs on 
State and local governments or preempt 
State law within the meaning of the 
Executive order. 
Drafting Information 
The principal authors of these final 
regulations are D. Peter Merkel and 
Sheila Ramaswamy of the Office of 
Associate Chief Counsel (International). 
However, other personnel from the 
Treasury Department and the IRS 
participated in their development. 
List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 1 
Income taxes, Reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements. 
Adoption of Amendments to the 
Regulations 
Accordingly, the Treasury Department 
and IRS amend 26 CFR part 1 as 
follows: 
PART 1—INCOME TAXES 
Paragraph 1. The authority citation 
for part 1 continues to read in part as 
follows: 
Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * * § 1.59A–2 [Amended] 
Par. 2. Section 1.59A–2 is amended 
by removing the language ‘‘§ 1.59A– 
3(b)(2)(iii)’’ from the last sentence of 
paragraph (e)(3)(vi) and adding the 
language ‘‘§ 1.59A–3(b)(2)(iv)’’ in its 
place. 
Par. 3. Section 1.59A–3 is amended 
by revising paragraph (b)(2)(iv) to read 
as follows: 
§ 1.59A–3 Base erosion payments and 
base erosion tax benefits. 
* * * * * 
(b) * * * 
(2) * * * 
(iv) Amounts paid or accrued with respect to mark-to-market positions— 
(A) In general. For any transaction with respect to which the taxpayer applies 
the mark-to-market method of 
accounting for U.S. Federal income tax 
purposes, the rules set forth in § 1.59A– 
2(e)(3)(vi) apply to determine the 
amount of the base erosion payment. 
(B) Application of the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (‘‘BEAT’’) netting 
rule to securities lending transactions. 
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) 
of this section, mark-to-market gains 
and losses from the securities leg of a 
securities lending transaction as defined 
in §§ 1.861–2(a)(7) and 1.861–3(a)(6) are 
not taken into account when applying 
§ 1.59A–2(e)(3)(vi) for purposes of 
determining the amount of a taxpayer’s 
base erosion payment. Mark-to market 
gains and losses from the securities leg 
of a securities lending transaction are 
the ordinary gains and losses that a 
taxpayer recognizes with respect to the 
transaction by treating the taxpayer’s 
position in the transaction as having 
been sold for its fair market value on the 
last business day of the taxable year 
(and any additional times as required by 
the Internal Revenue Code or the 
taxpayer’s method of accounting). See 
§ 1.59A–6(b)(1)(i). When determining 
the amount of the taxpayer’s base 
erosion payment, items of income, gain, 
loss, or deduction that relate to the 
securities leg of a securities lending 
transaction, such as substitute payments 
defined in §§ 1.861–2(a)(7) and 1.861– 
3(a)(6) and borrow fees, must be taken 
into account on a consistent basis that 
does not result in the duplication or 
omission of these amounts. For 
purposes of the immediately preceding 
sentence, the term items of income, 
gain, loss, or deduction that relate to the 
securities leg of a securities lending 
transaction does not include delivery of the securities to, or receipt of securities 
from, the lender. This paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(B) applies to a taxpayer that is 
either the borrower or lender with 
respect to the securities lending 
transaction. 
* * * * * 
Par. 4. Section 1.59A–6 is amended 
by adding paragraphs (b)(3)(iii) and (iv) 
to read as follows: 
§ 1.59A–6 Qualified derivative payment. 
* * * * * 
(b) * * * 
(3) * * * 
(iii) Special rule for mark-to-market gains and losses on the securities leg of 
a securities lending transaction—(A) In general. The amount of any qualified derivative payment with respect to the 
securities leg of a securities lending 
transaction as defined in §§ 1.861– 
2(a)(7) and 1.861–3(a)(6) that is 
excluded from the denominator of the 
base erosion percentage is determined 
under § 1.59A–3(b)(2)(iv)(B). The 
securities leg of a securities lending 
transaction refers to the rights, 
obligations, and transfers of securities 
and payments under the transaction 
other than the obligation to provide or 
right to receive cash collateral and 
interest thereon. Pursuant to § 1.59A– 
3(b)(2)(iv)(B), mark-to-market gains and 
losses on a securities leg of a securities 
lending transaction are not included in 
determining the amount of the qualified 
derivative payment with respect to that 
security. Thus, the amount of the 
qualified derivative payment with 
respect to the securities leg of a 
securities lending transaction is 
determined by taking into account only 
other items of income, gain, loss, or 
deduction during the taxable year that 
relate to the securities leg, such as 
substitute payments defined in 
§§ 1.861–2(a)(7) and 1.861–3(a)(6) and 
borrow fees. This paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) 
applies to a taxpayer that is either the 
borrower or lender with respect to the 
securities lending transaction. 
(B) Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of 
this paragraph (b)(3)(iii). 
(1) Example 1: Securities loan—(i) Facts. FP is a foreign corporation that owns all of the shares of DC, a domestic 
corporation. FP is a foreign related party 
of DC under § 1.59A–1(b)(12). DC is a 
registered securities dealer. On 
September 1 of year 1, DC enters into a 
securities lending transaction with FP in 
which it borrows stock from FP. DC 
provides cash collateral for the loan and 
receives a rebate on that collateral from 
FP. On September 1, year 1, the stock 
has a value of $100x. On November 1, 
year 1, a dividend of $1x is paid by the 
issuer on the stock. DC pays a substitute 
dividend of $1x to FP on November 1, 
year 1 under the terms of the securities 
loan. There are no other payments made 
or received in year 1. On December 31, 
year 1, the stock has a value of $106x. 
DC is required to mark-to-market the 
securities leg of the securities lending 
transaction for U.S. Federal income tax 
purposes. DC is a calendar year 
taxpayer. 
(ii) Analysis. DC has a deduction of $1x as a result of the substitute dividend 
it pays to FP. Assuming that the 
securities lending transaction otherwise

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES159050 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Rules and Regulations meets the requirements of this section 
(including reporting the information 
required by § 1.6038A–2(b)(7)(ix)), the 
amount of DC’s qualified derivative 
payment with respect to the securities 
lending transaction is $1x. Payments 
with respect to the cash collateral are 
not treated as part of the securities 
lending transaction. See paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. With respect 
to the securities leg of the securities 
lending transaction, DC has a mark-to- 
market loss of ($6x). Under paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the amount 
of this mark-to-market loss is not 
included when determining the amount 
of the qualified derivative payment. 
Under § 1.59A–3(b)(2)(iv)(B), DC’s ($6x) 
mark-to-market loss on the securities leg 
of the securities lending transaction also 
is not taken into account in determining 
the base erosion tax benefit amount for 
purposes of the numerator of the base 
erosion percentage. The ($6x) loss is 
taken into account in the denominator 
of the base erosion percentage, while the 
$1x substitute dividend payment is not 
taken into account for that purpose 
because it is a qualified derivative 
payment. See § 1.59A–2(e)(3)(ii)(C) and (e)(3)(vi). The amount of the qualified 
derivative payment would be the same 
if the lender paid a rebate on the cash 
collateral in year 1, without regard to 
whether the parties agree to pay and 
receive a net payment reflecting the 
difference between the amount of the 
rebate and the amount of the substitute 
payment. 
(2) Example 2: Securities loan. The facts are the same as in paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii)(B)(1) of this section (Example 
1) except that on December 31, year 1, 
the stock has a value of $94x. With 
respect to the securities leg of the 
securities lending transaction, DC has a 
mark-to-market gain of $6x. Under 
paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, 
the amount of this mark-to-market gain 
is not included when determining the 
amount of the qualified derivative 
payment. DC has a deduction of $1x as 
a result of the substitute dividend 
payment it makes to FP. Assuming that 
the securities lending transaction 
otherwise meets the requirements of this 
section (including reporting the 
information required by § 1.6038A– 
2(b)(7)(ix)), the amount of DC’s qualified 
derivative payment with respect to the 
securities lending transaction is $1x. 
Neither the $6x gain nor the $1x 
substitute dividend payment, which is a 
qualified derivative payment, are taken 
into account in the denominator of the 
base erosion percentage. 
(iv) Rule for determining the amount of a substitute payment or other 
payment paid with respect to a 
securities lending transaction to a 
foreign related party—(A) In general. When a taxpayer makes a substitute 
payment as defined in § 1.861–2(a)(7) or 
§ 1.861–3(a)(6) or other payment with 
respect to the securities leg of a 
securities lending transaction, the 
taxpayer must determine whether the 
substitute payment or other payment is 
paid to a foreign related party. The 
amount of the substitute payment or 
other payment paid by the taxpayer to 
a foreign related party is determined 
under either paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B) or 
(C) of this section. 
(B) Specific identification method. The taxpayer may determine the amount 
of the substitute payments or other 
payments with respect to the securities 
leg of a securities lending transaction 
that it has paid to foreign related parties 
by using the amount actually paid by 
the taxpayer to the foreign related 
parties if the taxpayer can specifically 
identify all recipients of the substitute 
payments or other payments paid by the 
taxpayer during the taxable year with 
respect to the securities leg of a 
securities lending transaction or the 
taxpayer can specifically identify the 
payor for all substitute payments or 
other payments received by foreign 
related parties during the taxable year 
with respect to the securities leg of a 
securities lending transaction. 
(C) Alternative method. If the taxpayer has paid any substitute payment or 
other payment with respect to the 
securities leg of a securities lending 
transaction to which the taxpayer 
cannot apply paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B) of 
this section, the taxpayer must use the 
methodology provided in this paragraph 
(b)(3)(iv)(C). 
(1) Step 1: Determining the total amount of substitute payments and 
other payments received by foreign 
related parties. The taxpayer must 
determine the total amount of substitute 
payments and other payments with 
respect to the securities leg of a 
securities lending transaction received 
by all foreign related parties of the 
taxpayer during the taxable year. 
(2) Step 2: Determining the total amount of substitute payments and 
other payments paid by taxpayer. The 
taxpayer must determine the total 
amount of substitute payments and 
other payments with respect to the 
securities leg of a securities lending 
transaction paid by the taxpayer during 
the taxable year. 
(3) Step 3: Determining the amount of substitute payments and other payments 
paid by the taxpayer to foreign related 
parties. The amount of substitute payments and other payments with 
respect to the securities leg of a 
securities lending transaction paid by 
the taxpayer is treated as being paid first 
to foreign related parties of the taxpayer 
up to the total amount of substitute 
payments and other payments with 
respect to the securities leg of a 
securities lending transaction received 
by foreign related parties. Any amount 
of substitute payments and other 
payments with respect to the securities 
leg of a securities lending transaction 
paid by the taxpayer that exceeds the 
amount of substitute payments and 
other payments received by foreign 
related parties is treated as paid to 
unrelated parties for purposes of this 
paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(C)(3). 
(D) Example—(1) Facts. FP is a foreign corporation that owns all of the 
shares of DC, a domestic corporation, 
and all of the shares of several foreign 
subsidiaries. FP and its foreign 
subsidiaries are foreign related parties of 
DC under § 1.59A–1(b)(12). DC is a 
registered securities dealer. DC enters 
into securities lending transactions 
pursuant to which it borrows securities 
both from foreign affiliates that are 
members of the FP controlled group and 
from unrelated customers. DC obtains 
the securities from a common pool of 
available securities that includes 
securities from DC’s U.S. customer 
accounts as well as securities held by 
members of the FP controlled group for 
their own account and for the account 
of customers. DC is unable to determine 
from its records either the identities of 
the counterparties from which DC has 
borrowed securities or whether it has 
entered into a securities lending 
transaction with a foreign affiliate. In 
year 1, DC makes substitute payments of 
$500x in aggregate with respect to the 
securities lending transactions. DC’s 
foreign affiliates receive substitute 
payments in year 1 totaling $100x. 
Because DC cannot determine whether 
it has entered into a securities lending 
transaction with a foreign affiliate, DC 
does not know what portion of the 
$100x received by DC’s foreign affiliates 
was paid by DC. 
(2) Analysis. Because DC is unable to determine the actual amount of 
substitute payments it has paid to DC’s 
foreign affiliates, DC cannot use the 
specific identification method of 
paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B) of this section to 
determine the amount of substitute 
payments it has paid to foreign related 
parties for QDP reporting purposes. 
Instead, DC must use the alternative 
method set forth in paragraph 
(b)(3)(iv)(C) of this section to determine 
the amount of substitute payments 
treated as made to foreign related party 
recipients. Under Step 1, DC determines 
that its foreign affiliates have received

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES159051 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Rules and Regulations substitute payments of $100x. Under 
Step 2, DC determines that it has paid 
substitute payments totaling $500x. 
Under Step 3, DC is treated as having 
paid substitute payments to its foreign 
affiliates of $100x, up to the total 
amount of substitute payments they 
received in year 1. The remaining $400x 
of substitute payments paid by DC is 
treated as having been paid to unrelated 
parties for purposes of paragraph 
(b)(3)(iv)(C)(3) of this section.

I. Background 
A. Statutory Requirements 
Section 110(a)(1) of the CAA requires 
each state to submit to the EPA, within 
three years after the promulgation of a 
primary or secondary NAAQS or any 
revision thereof, a SIP revision that 
provides for the implementation, 
maintenance, and enforcement of such 
NAAQS. 
Section 110(a)(2) of the CAA contains 
the infrastructure SIP requirements that 
generally relate to the information, 
authorities, compliance assurances, 
procedural requirements, and control 
measures that constitute the 
‘‘infrastructure’’ of a state’s air quality 
management program. These 
infrastructure SIP requirements (or 
‘‘elements’’) required by section 
110(a)(2) are as follows: 
€Section 110(a)(2)(A): Emission limits and other control measures. 
€Section 110(a)(2)(B): Ambient air quality monitoring/data system. 
€Section 110(a)(2)(C): Program for enforcement of control measures and 
regulation of new and modified 
stationary sources. 
€Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i): Interstate pollution transport. 
€Section 110(a)(2)(D)(ii): Interstate and international pollution abatement. 
€Section 110(a)(2)(E): Adequate resources and authority, conflict of 
interest, and oversight of local and 
regional government agencies. 
€Section 110(a)(2)(F): Stationary source monitoring and reporting. 
€Section 110(a)(2)(G): Emergency episodes. 
€Section 110(a)(2)(H): SIP revisions. €Section 110(a)(2)(J): Consultation with government officials, public 
notification, PSD, and visibility 
protection. 
€Section 110(a)(2)(K): Air quality modeling and submittal of modeling 
data. 
€Section 110(a)(2)(L): Permitting fees. 
€Section 110(a)(2)(M): Consultation/ participation by affected local entities. 
There are certain infrastructure SIP 
requirements under section 110(a)(2) 
that are not addressed in this final 
action. First, two elements identified in 
section 110(a)(2) are not governed by the 
three-year submittal deadline of section 
110(a)(1). These two elements are: (i) 
section 110(a)(2)(C), to the extent that it 
refers to permit programs required 
under part D (nonattainment new source 
review (NSR)), and (ii) section 
110(a)(2)(I), pertaining to the 
nonattainment planning requirements of 
part D. As a result, this action does not 
address the nonattainment NSR 
requirements of section 110(a)(2)(C) or 
the entirety of section 110(a)(2)(I). 
Additionally, this action does not 
address the requirements of section 
110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) pertaining to 
contributions to nonattainment or 
interference with maintenance in other 
States, referred to as ‘‘prongs 1 and 2’’ 
and 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(II) pertaining to 
interference with visibility protection in 
other States, referred to as ‘‘prong 4.’’ 
The EPA has proposed action on 
Arizona’s SIP revision with respect to 
prongs 1 and 2 in a separate 
rulemaking,
1
and has finalized action on 
prong 4 in a separate rulemaking.
2
 
Finally, there are several requirements, 
for which we originally proposed partial 
approval and partial disapproval,
3
that 
we will now be deferring action on. 
These include the requirements of 
110(a)(2)(C) as they relate to major 
source preconstruction PSD permitting, 
but also extend to the portions of 
110(a)(2)(D)(i), 110(a)(2)(D)(ii), and 
110(a)(2)(J) that reference PSD 
requirements and rely on our analysis of 
PSD permitting in Element C. We will 
be addressing the PSD requirements of 
110(a)(2)(C), 110(a)(2)(D)(i), 
110(a)(2)(D)(ii), and 110(a)(2)(J) in a 
separate, future rulemaking. 
B. State Submittals 
The Arizona Department of 
Environmental Quality (ADEQ) 
submitted two SIP revisions to address 
the infrastructure SIP requirements in 
CAA sections 110(a)(1) and 110(a)(2) for 
the 2012 PM
2.5
NAAQS. On December 
11, 2015, ADEQ submitted the ‘‘Arizona 
State Implementation Plan Revision for 
the 2012 Fine Particulate Matter (PM
2.5
) 
National Ambient Air Quality 
Standard’’ (‘‘2015 PM
2.5
I–SIP 
submittal’’).
4
On February 10, 2022, 
ADEQ submitted the ‘‘State 
Implementation Plan Revision: Clean 
Air Act Section 110(a)(2) for the 2012 
Fine Particulate & 2015 Ozone NAAQS’’ 
(‘‘2022 I–SIP supplement’’).
5
These 
submittals collectively address 
Arizona’s obligation to satisfy 
infrastructure SIP requirements for the 
2012 PM
2.5
NAAQS. We refer to them 
herein as ‘‘Arizona’s 2012 PM
2.5
I–SIP 
submittals.’’ 
We are taking final action on these 
submittals with respect to the 2012 
PM
2.5
NAAQS except for those portions 
of the 2012 PM
2.5
I–SIP submittals 
addressing prongs 1, 2, and 4 of the 
interstate transport requirements under 
CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(i). 
Additionally, we are deferring action on 
the requirements under CAA section

Prior to ADEQ’s submittal of Maricopa County’s 
Regulation VI—Emergency Episodes, Rule 600 
‘‘Emergency Episodes’’ with the 2022 I–SIP 
supplement on February 10, 2022, ADEQ submitted 
the same rule as a standalone submission on 
December 17, 2021. We have determined the 
content of these two submittals to be identical to 
one another. Therefore, we are choosing to fulfill 
our statutory obligation to act on the rule by 
approving the submission included as part of the 
2022 I–SIP supplement. Furthermore, ADEQ, 
prompted by a request from Maricopa County Air 
Quality Department, has withdrawn the December 
17, 2021 rule submittal, included in the docket for 
this rulemaking.

ADEQ’s ‘‘Procedures for the Prevention of 
Emergency Episodes’’ is located in Appendix D to 
the 2022 I–SIP supplement.

CFR 81.268 with ADEQ and the State’s concurrence 
and formal request for these revisions is included 
as a letter in the docket for this rulemaking with 
our notice of final action. See letter from Daniel 
Czecholinkski, Director, ADEQ Air Quality 
Division, to Matthew Lakin, Director, EPA Region

110(a)(2)(D)(ii), and 110(a)(2)(J) with 
respect to the major source PSD 
requirements referenced within those 
elements. Our deferral on these sub- 
elements extends to all Arizona 
permitting agencies. We are also not 
taking action on the portions of the 2022 
I–SIP supplement addressing the 2015 
ozone NAAQS in this rulemaking. 
C. Summary of EPA’s Proposal and 
Incorporation of Rules Into Arizona’s 
State Implementation Plan 
We evaluated Arizona’s 2012 PM
2.5
I– 
SIP submittals and the existing 
provisions of the Arizona SIP for 
compliance with the infrastructure SIP 
requirements of CAA section 110(a)(2) 
and the applicable regulations in 40 
CFR part 51 (‘‘Requirements for 
Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of 
State Implementation Plans’’). Based on 
the evaluation presented in the June 13, 
2024 proposed rulemaking and in the 
accompanying technical support 
document (TSD), we proposed to 
partially approve and partially 
disapprove Arizona’s 2012 PM
2.5
I–SIP 
submittals with respect to the 2012 
PM
2.5
NAAQS.
6
Additionally, we 
proposed to approve two rules and one 
plan submitted with the 2022 I–SIP 
supplement: the revised Maricopa 
County Air Pollution control Regulation 
VI—Emergency Episodes ‘‘Rule 600 
Emergency Episodes,’’
7
the revised 
Arizona Administrative Code (AAC) 
R18–2–220 ‘‘Air Pollution Emergency 
Episodes,’’ and the ‘‘Procedures for the 
Prevention of Emergency Episodes.’’
8
 
Also submitted with the 2022 I–SIP 
supplement are the Arizona Revised 
Statute (ARS) 49–432(C), dealing with 
public availability of emissions records, 
and Pima County Code (PCC) 17.24.010 
‘‘Confidentiality of trade secrets, sales 
data, and propriety information.’’
9
The 
EPA took final action to approve the 
revised ARS 49–432 and PCC 17.24.010 
for incorporation into the Arizona SIP in 
a separate rulemaking.
10
Based upon the 
analysis detailed in our proposed 
rulemaking and TSD, we find that 
Maricopa County Regulation VI— 
Emergency Episodes, Rule 600 
‘‘Emergency Episodes,’’ AAC R18–2– 
220 ‘‘Air Pollution Emergency 
Episodes,’’ and the ‘‘Procedures for the 
Prevention of Emergency Episodes,’’ 
meet the requirements of CAA section 
110(a)(2)(G) and other CAA 
requirements. Therefore, the EPA is 
approving the revised versions of 
Maricopa County Regulation VI— 
Emergency Episodes, Rule 600 
‘‘Emergency Episodes,’’ AAC R18–2– 
220 ‘‘Air Pollution Emergency 
Episodes,’’ and the ‘‘Procedures for the 
Prevention of Emergency Episodes’’ into 
the Arizona SIP. 
D. Revising Air Quality Control Regions 
and Evaluating Emergency Episode 
Planning Requirements for PM
2.5
in 
Arizona 
40 CFR part 51, subpart H 
(‘‘Prevention of Air Pollution 
Emergency Episodes’’) contains EPA’s 
implementing regulations for CAA 
section 110(a)(2)(G) (§§ 51.150 through 
51.153). 40 CFR 51.150 of subpart H 
provides criteria for the classification of 
areas for emergency episode planning 
purposes based on measured 
concentrations of ambient air pollutants, 
specifically sulfur oxides, particulate 
matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen 
dioxide, and ozone. The priority 
thresholds for classification of AQCR 
are listed at 40 CFR 51.150, and the 
specific classifications of AQCR in 
Arizona are listed at 40 CFR 52.121. 
Consistent with the provisions of 40 
CFR 51.153, reclassification of an AQCR 
must rely on the most recent three years 
of air quality data. Under 40 CFR 51.151 
and 51.152, regions classified under the 
more stringent classifications of Priority 
I, IA, or II are required to have SIP- 
approved emergency episode 
contingency plans, while those 
classified Priority III are not required to 
have plans. We also interpret 40 CFR 
51.153 as establishing the means for 
states to review air quality data and 
request a higher or lower classification 
for any given region and as providing 
the regulatory basis for the EPA to 
reclassify such regions, as appropriate, 
under the authorities of CAA sections 
110(a)(2)(G) and 301(a)(1). For reasons 
detailed in our notice of proposed 
rulemaking and the TSD, we determined 
that counties in the Maricopa Intrastate 
AQCR are required to have emergency 
episode plans for PM
2.5
. ADEQ and 
Maricopa County both regulate air 
quality in the Maricopa Intrastate AQCR 
and as covered in our notice of 
proposed rulemaking, both counties 
have submitted emergency episode 
plans. As detailed in our proposal and 
associated TSD, we find that these plans 
satisfy the requirements of 110(a)(2)(G) 
of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51, subpart 
H. 
We also proposed a revision to 40 
CFR 52.121 to add La Paz County to the 
list of constituent counties for the 
Mohave-Yuma Intrastate AQCR, and to 
40 CFR 81.268, we proposed to add La 
Paz County to the delimited area of the 
Mohave-Yuma Intrastate AQCR.
11
This 
action finalizes those amendments to 40 
CFR 51.121 and 40 CFR 81.268 as 
proposed. 
II. Public Comments and EPA 
Responses 
The EPA’s proposed action provided 
a 30-day public comment period that 
ended on July 15, 2024. During this 
period, the EPA received four 
comments. Three of these comments 
were from the Center for Biological 
Diversity (CBD) and the remaining 
comment was from another 
organization. Copies of each comment 
have been added to the docket for this 
action and are accessible at https://
www.regulations.gov. The three comments from CBD concerned ADEQ’s 
PSD permitting program. Because we 
are deferring action on the PSD-related 
elements of Arizona’s 2012 PM
2.5
I–SIP 
submittal, we are not responding to 
those comments at this time. Below we 
summarize the remaining comment and 
provide our response. 
One comment from a different 
organization argued that the EPA’s 
review of infrastructure SIP submittals 
for the 2012 PM
2.5
NAAQS should 
include considerations for the emissions 
caused by the smoking of marijuana and 
cannabis, and the emissions associated 
with their production. Additionally, the 
comment requested that the EPA also 
add marijuana and cannabis to the 
‘‘toxic substance list.’’
12
 
After reviewing the comment, the 
EPA has determined that the comment 
fails to raise issues germane to the

III. Final Action 
A. Approvals 
As detailed in section I. of this 
rulemaking, we are taking final action to 
approve certain portions of Arizona’s I– 
SIP submittals for the 2012 PM
2.5
 
NAAQS. Specifically, we are approving 
the submittal for the requirements of the 
following CAA sections: 
€110(a)(2)(A)—Emission limits and other control measures. 
€110(a)(2)(B)—Ambient air quality monitoring/data system.

B. Deferred Action 
The EPA previously proposed to 
partially approve and partially 
disapproval the following PSD-related 
CAA requirements under 110(a)(2). At 
this time, we are not finalizing our 
proposed action on these elements and 
will instead address the requirements in 
a separate rulemaking: 
€110(a)(2)(C)—Program for regulation of new and modified major 
source stationary sources. 
€110(a)(2)(D)(i)(II)—Interference with PSD (prong 3). 
€110(a)(2)(D)(ii)—Interstate pollution abatement, CAA section 126. 
€110(a)(2)(J)—PSD. We note that the EPA proposed to 
approve prongs 1 and 2 of 
110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) in a separate 
rulemaking.
13
We took final action to 
disapprove prong 4 of 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(II) 
as part of a larger action addressing 
Arizona’s Regional Haze requirements 
for the second implementation period.

C. Incorporation of Rules Into Arizona’s 
State Implementation Plan 
For the reasons described in our 
proposed rulemaking and TSD, we are 
finalizing approval of two rules and one 
plan included with the 2022 I–SIP 
supplement into the Arizona SIP: AAC 
R18–2–220 ‘‘Air Pollution Emergency 
Episodes,’’ the accompanying plan 
‘‘Procedures for the Prevention of 
Emergency Episodes,’’ and the Maricopa 
County Air Pollution Control Regulation 
VI, ‘‘Emergency Episodes: Rule 600 
Emergency Episodes’’. Based on our 
analysis, we find that these rules meet 
the requirements of CAA sections 
110(a)(2), 110(l), and 193. 
D. Revising Air Quality Control Regions 
and Evaluating Emergency Episode 
Planning Requirements for PM
2.5
in 
Arizona 
For the reasons described in our 
proposed rulemaking, and in response 
to the State’s request, we are taking final 
action to revise 40 CFR 52.121 to add La 
Paz County to the list of constituent 
counties for the Mohave-Yuma 
Intrastate AQCR, and to 40 CFR 81.268, 
to add La Paz County to the delimited 
area of the Mohave-Yuma Intrastate 
AQCR.
15
We also evaluated the three 
most recent years of complete, quality- 
assured, and certified ambient air 
monitoring data to yield maximum 24- 
hour PM
2.5
concentrations for each 
county;
16
the maximum recorded 24- 
hour PM
2.5
concentrations along with 
our finalized classifications for each 
AQCR are compiled in table 16 of the 
TSD accompanying this rulemaking. As 
discussed in our proposed rulemaking 
document, ADEQ and Maricopa County 
have both submitted emergency episode 
plans, and we are taking final action to 
find that these plans satisfy the 
requirements of 40 CFR 51.152(a)–(b) 
and 110(a)(2)(G) of the CAA. 
IV. Incorporation by Reference 
In this document, the EPA is 
finalizing regulatory text that includes 
incorporation by reference. The EPA is 
finalizing the incorporation of AAC 
R18–2–220 ‘‘Air Pollution Emergency 
Episodes,’’ the ‘‘Procedures for the 
Prevention of Emergency Episodes,’’ 
and the Maricopa County Air Pollution 
Control Regulation VI, ‘‘Emergency 
Episodes: Rule 600 Emergency 
Episodes,’’ into the Arizona SIP, which 
are incorporated by reference in 
accordance with the requirements of 1 
CFR part 51. The EPA has made, and 
will continue to make, these documents 
available through https://
www.regulations.gov and at the EPA Region 9 Office (please contact the 
person identified in the 
FOR FURTHER 
INFORMATION CONTACTsection of this 
preamble for more information). 
V. Statutory and Executive Order 
Reviews 
Under the CAA, the Administrator is 
required to approve a SIP submission 
that complies with the provisions of the 
Act and applicable federal regulations. 
42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). 
Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, the 
EPA’s role is to approve state choices, 
provided that they meet the criteria of 
the CAA. Accordingly, this action 
merely approves state law as meeting 
federal requirements and does not 
impose additional requirements beyond 
those imposed by state law. For that 
reason, this action: 
€Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review by the Office of 
Management and Budget under 
Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, 
October 4, 1993); 
€Is not subject to Executive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, February 6, 2025) 
because SIP actions are exempt from 
review under Executive Order 12866; 
€Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions 
of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 
U.S.C. 3501 et seq.); 
€Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities 
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601 et seq.); 
€Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely 
affect small governments, as described 
in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
of 1995 (Pub. L. 104–4); 
€Does not have federalism implications as specified in Executive 
Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 
1999); 
€Is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997)

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES159055 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Rules and Regulations because it proposes to approve a state 
program; 
€Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 
28355, May 22, 2001); and 
€Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the National 
Technology Transfer and Advancement 
Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because 
application of those requirements would 
be inconsistent with the CAA. 
In addition, the SIP is not approved 
to apply on any Indian reservation land 
or in any other area where the EPA or 
an Indian Tribe has demonstrated that a 
Tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of 
Indian country, the rule does not have 
Tribal implications and will not impose 
substantial direct costs on Tribal 
governments or preempt Tribal law as 
specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 
FR 67249, November 9, 2000). 
This action is subject to the 
Congressional Review Act (CRA), and 
the EPA will submit a rule report to 
each House of the Congress and to the 
Comptroller General of the United 
States. This action is not a ‘‘major rule’’ 
as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2). 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 
petitions for judicial review of this 
action must be filed in the United States 
Court of Appeals for the appropriate 
circuit by February 17, 2026. Filing a 
petition for reconsideration by the 
Administrator of this final rule does not 
affect the finality of this action for the 
purposes of judicial review nor does it 
extend the time within which a petition 
for judicial review may be filed, and 
shall not postpone the effectiveness of 
such rule or action. This action may not 
be challenged later in proceedings to 
enforce its requirements (see section 
307(b)(2)).

New Source Performance Standards; 
Delegation of Authority to Oklahoma 
AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
ACTION: Final rule; notification of delegation. 
SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving updates to 
the Code of Federal Regulations that 
reflect Oklahoma’s current New Source 
Performance Standards (NSPS) 
delegation status and the mailing 
address for the Oklahoma Department of 
Environmental Quality (ODEQ). The 
ODEQ submitted updated regulations 
for receiving delegation of EPA 
authority for implementation and 
enforcement of certain NSPS. The 
updated State regulations incorporate by 
reference certain NSPS promulgated by 
EPA, as they existed through June 30, 
2023. The delegation of authority for 
implementation and enforcement 
applies to sources subject to the 
delegated NSPS, including those located 
in certain areas of Indian country as 
discussed herein. 
DATES: This rule is effective on January 20, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: The EPA has established a docket for this action under Docket ID 
No. EPA–R06–OAR–2010–0580. All 
documents in the docket are listed on 
the https://www.regulations.gov website. Although listed in the index,

Throughout this document whenever 
‘‘we,’’ ‘‘us,’’ or ‘‘our’’ is used, we mean 
the EPA. 
I. Background 
The background for this action is 
discussed in detail in our July 7, 2025, 
proposal (90 FR 29826). In that 
document we proposed to approve 
updates to the delegation of NSPS to 
ODEQ. The delegation provides ODEQ 
with the primary responsibility to 
implement and enforce the delegated 
NSPS standards, as they existed through 
June 30, 2023. 
II. Response to Comments 
EPA received two anonymous 
comments. One comment was deemed 
to be non-relevant to this action. The 
other comment requests EPA encourage 
ODEQ to consider carbon dioxide 
emissions as part of its broader 
regulatory and permitting context and in 
its implementation of NSPS standards. 
We thank the commenter for the 
comment but find the request to be 
beyond the scope of the current NSPS 
delegation. This action aims to approve 
ODEQ’s requested updates to its current 
NSPS delegation, it does not speak to 
Oklahoma’s broader regulatory scheme 
or alter the requirements of the 
delegated NSPS standards. As such, we 
are finalizing the NSPS delegations to 
ODEQ as proposed. 
III. Impacts on Areas of Indian Country 
Following the U.S. Supreme Court 
decision in McGirt v. Oklahoma, 140 S. Ct. 2452 (2020), the Governor of the 
State of Oklahoma requested approval 
under Section 10211(a) of the Safe, 
Accountable, Flexible, Efficient 
Transportation Equity Act of 2005: A 
Legacy for Users, Public Law 109–59, 
119 Stat. 1144, 1937 (August 10, 2005) 
(‘‘SAFETEA’’), to administer in certain 
areas of Indian country (as defined at 18 
U.S.C. 1151) the State’s environmental 
regulatory programs that were 
previously approved by the EPA outside 
of Indian country. The State’s request 
excluded certain areas of Indian country 
further described below. 
The EPA has approved Oklahoma’s 
SAFETEA request to administer all of 
the State’s EPA-approved environmental 
regulatory programs in the requested 
areas of Indian country. As requested by 
Oklahoma, the EPA’s approval under 
SAFETEA does not include Indian 
country lands, including rights-of-way 
running through the same, that: (1) 
qualify as Indian allotments, the Indian 
titles to which have not been 
extinguished, under 18 U.S.C. 1151(c); 
(2) are held in trust by the United States 
on behalf of an individual Indian or 
Tribe; or (3) are owned in fee by a Tribe, 
if the Tribe (a) acquired that fee title to 
such land, or an area that included such 
land, in accordance with a treaty with 
the United States to which such Tribe 
was a party, and (b) never allotted the 
land to a member or citizen of the Tribe 
(collectively ‘‘excluded Indian country 
lands’’). 
The EPA’s approval under SAFETEA 
expressly provided that to the extent the 
EPA’s prior approvals of Oklahoma’s 
environmental programs excluded 
Indian country, any such exclusions are 
superseded for the geographic areas of 
Indian country covered by the EPA’s 
approval of Oklahoma’s SAFETEA 
request. The approval also provided that 
future revisions or amendments to 
Oklahoma’s approved environmental 
regulatory programs would extend to 
the covered areas of Indian country 
(without any further need for additional 
requests under SAFETEA). 
As explained above, the EPA is 
finalizing an update to the Oklahoma 
NSPS delegation which will apply 
statewide in Oklahoma. Consistent with 
the EPA’s SAFETEA approval, this 
NSPS delegation will apply to areas of 
Indian country pursuant to the 
SAFETEA approval, including to all

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES159058 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Rules and Regulations 1
The ODEQ previously submitted requests to 
EPA for updates to the Oklahoma NSPS delegation, 
by letters dated August 23, 2012, March 17, 2015, 
November 2, 2016, June 6, 2018 (revised with a 
subsequent June 29, 2018 letter), December 23, 
2019, March 23, 2021 (revised with a subsequent 
September 14, 2021 email), December 2, 2021 
(revised with a subsequent October 17, 2022 letter), 
October 17, 2022, and November 30, 2023. EPA 
determined that those requests met the 
requirements of the CAA and the 1982 and 1999 
NSPS Delegations concerning the approval of EPA’s 
delegation of authority for the enforcement and 
implementation of the NSPS in Oklahoma. EPA 
previously proposed an action on ODEQ’s request 
to update its NSPS delegation (85 FR 31423, May 
26, 2020); that proposed action was subsumed and 
incorporated into our July 7, 2025, re-proposal (90 
FR 29826). 
Indian country in the State of Oklahoma 
other than the excluded Indian country 
lands as described above. 
IV. Final Action 
EPA is taking final action to approve 
updates to the delegation of certain 
NSPS to ODEQ, and amending 40 CFR 
part 60 to (1) include a table of the 
specific NSPS provisions delegated to 
the ODEQ and (2) update the mailing 
address for the ODEQ for submittal of 
documents required under the delegated 
NSPS provisions, so as to provide the 
ODEQ with the authority to implement 
and enforce certain newly incorporated 
NSPS promulgated by the EPA and 
amendments to existing standards 
currently delegated, as they existed 
though June 30, 2023. 
V. Statutory and Executive Order 
Reviews 
Under the CAA, EPA previously 
delegated to the ODEQ the authority to 
implement and enforce certain NSPS for 
sources located in Oklahoma, as 
provided for under 42 U.S.C. 7411(c)(1); 
see also 40 CFR 60.4(b). Pursuant to the 
terms and conditions of that delegation, 
this action informs the public that EPA 
has found the ODEQ’s October 28, 2024, 
request
1
to update the delegation status 
for NSPS standards meets Federal 
requirements and does not impose 
additional requirements beyond those 
imposed by State law. Through this 
action, EPA is proposing to add a table 
to 40 CFR part 60 listing the specific 
NSPS currently delegated to the ODEQ 
and update the ODEQ’s address for 
submittal of documents required under 
the delegated NSPS provisions. 
For this action, a review of all 
applicable Statutory and Executive 
Orders are indicated as follows: 
A. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory 
Planning and Review and Executive 
Order 13563: Improving Regulation and 
Regulatory Review 
This action is not a significant 
regulatory action as defined in 
Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, 
October 4, 1993) and was therefore not 
submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) for review. 
B. Executive Order 14192: Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation 
This action is not an Executive Order 
14192 regulatory action because this 
action is not significant under Executive 
Order 12866. 
C. Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) 
This action does not impose an 
information collection burden under the 
PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) because it 
does not contain any information 
collection activities. 
D. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
This action is certified to not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities 
under the RFA (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). 
This action approves the delegation of 
Federal rules as requested by the state 
agency and will therefore have no net 
regulatory burden for all directly 
regulated small entities. 
E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
(UMRA) 
This action does not contain an 
unfunded mandate as described in 
UMRA, 2 U.S.C. 1531–1538, and does 
not significantly or uniquely affect small 
governments. This action imposes no 
enforceable duty on any State, local, or 
tribal governments or the private sector. 
F. Executive Order 13132: Federalism 
This action does not have federalism 
implications as specified in Executive 
Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 
1999). It will not have substantial direct 
effects on the states, on the relationship 
between the national government and 
the states, or on the distribution of 
power and responsibilities among the 
various levels of government. 
G. Executive Order 13175: Consultation 
and Coordination With Indian Tribal 
Governments 
This update to the delegation of 
certain NSPS to ODEQ will apply to 
certain areas of Indian country 
throughout Oklahoma as discussed in 
the preamble, and therefore has tribal 
implications as specified in E.O. 13175 
(65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). 
However, this action will neither 
impose substantial direct compliance 
costs on federally recognized tribal 
governments, nor preempt Tribal law. 
This action will not impose substantial 
direct compliance costs on federally 
recognized tribal governments because 
no actions will be required of Tribal 
governments. This action will also not 
preempt tribal law as no Oklahoma tribe 
implements a regulatory program under 
the CAA and thus does not have 
applicable or related Tribal laws. 
Consistent with the EPA Policy on 
Consultation and Coordination with 
Indian Tribes (December 7, 2023), the 
EPA has offered consultation to all 38 
Tribal governments whose lands are 
located within the exterior boundaries 
of the State of Oklahoma and that may 
be affected by this action and provided 
information about this action. 
H. Executive Order 13045: Protection of 
Children From Environmental Health 
Risks and Safety Risks 
The EPA interprets Executive Order 
13045 as applying only to regulatory 
actions considered significant under 
section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866 
and that concern environmental health 
or safety risks that EPA has reason to 
believe may disproportionately affect 
children, per the definition of ‘‘covered 
regulatory action’’ in section 2–202 of 
Executive Order 13045. This action is 
not subject to Executive Order 13045 
because it approves a state program. 
I. Executive Order 13211: Actions 
Concerning Regulations That 
Significantly Affect Energy Supply, 
Distribution or Use 
This action is not subject to Executive 
Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 
2001), because it is not a significant 
regulatory action under Executive Order 
12866. 
J. National Technology Transfer and 
Advancement Act (NTTAA) 
This rule does not involve technical 
standards. This action is not subject to 
requirements of section 12(d) of the 
National Technology Transfer and 
Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 
272 note) because application of those 
requirements would be inconsistent 
with the Clean Air Act. 
K. Congressional Review Act (CRA) 
This action is subject to the CRA, and 
the EPA will submit a rule report to 
each House of the Congress and to the 
Comptroller General of the United 
States. This action is not a ‘‘major rule’’ 
as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2). 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 
petitions for judicial review of this 
action must be filed in the United States 
Court of Appeals for the appropriate 
circuit by February 17, 2026. Filing a 
petition for reconsideration by the 
Administrator of this final rule does not 
affect the finality of this action for the 
purposes of judicial review nor does it 
extend the time within which a petition

New Source Performance Standards 
and National Emission Standards for 
Hazardous Air Pollutants; Delegation 
of Authority to Louisiana 
AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) has 
submitted updated regulations for 
receiving delegation and approval of its 
program for the implementation and 
enforcement of certain New Source 
Performance Standards (NSPS) and 
National Emission Standards for 
Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for 
all sources (both part 70 and non-part 70 
sources), as provided for under 
previously approved delegation 
mechanisms. The updated State 
regulations incorporate by reference 
certain NSPS and NESHAP promulgated 
by the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) at parts 60, 61 and 63, as they 
existed through July 1, 2021. The EPA 
is providing notice that it is taking final 
action to approve the delegation of 
certain NSPS and NESHAP to LDEQ. 
The delegation of authority under this 
action does not apply to sources located 
in Indian country. 
DATES: This rule is effective on January 20, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: The EPA has established a docket for this action under Docket ID 
No. EPA–R06–OAR–2010–1054. All

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Throughout this document ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘us,’’ 
and ‘‘our’’ means the EPA. 
I. Background 
The background for this action is 
discussed in detail in our June 23, 2025, 
proposal (90 FR 26482). In that 
document we proposed to approve 
updating the delegation of certain NSPS 
and NESHAP to LDEQ. The delegation 
will provide LDEQ with the primary 
responsibility to implement and enforce 
the delegated standards. 
During the update of the 
aforementioned delegations, we 
identified the need to correct certain 
subparts that were mistakenly included 
and/or omitted in the Technical Support 
Document (TSD) submitted with the 
proposal for this action and filed in the 
docket. These corrections are the logical 
outgrowth from our finalization of the 
LDEQ’s proposed delegations for NSPS 
and NESHAP. They are now reflected in 
the respective tables located in the 
amendatory language section of this 
action. 
II. Response to Comment 
EPA received an anonymous public 
comment. The comment states that 
administrative practice is required and 
necessary to achieve goals. We thank the 
commenter for the comment and note 
administrative practices were followed 
for this action. This action finalizes 
updates to LDEQ’s current NSPS and 
NESHAP delegations, following a 
proposed action and a public comment 
period. As such, we are finalizing the 
NSPS and NESHAP delegations to 
LDEQ as proposed. 
III. Final Action 
The EPA is taking final action to 
approve updates to the delegation of 
certain NSPS to LDEQ, and to update 
the Louisiana NESHAP delegation to 
provide the LDEQ with the authority to 
implement and enforce certain newly 
incorporated NESHAP promulgated by 
the EPA and amendments to existing 
standards currently delegated, as they 
existed through July 1, 2021. 
IV. Statutory and Executive Order 
Reviews 
Under the CAA, the Administrator 
has the authority to approve delegation 
requests that comply with the 
provisions of the Act and applicable 
Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7411(c) 
and 7412(1). In reviewing delegation 
submissions, the EPA’s role is to 
approve State choices, provided that 
they meet the criteria and objectives of 
the CAA and of the EPA’s implementing 
regulations. Accordingly, this action 
merely approves the State’s request as 
meeting Federal requirements and does 
not impose additional requirements 
beyond those imposed by State law. For 
that reason, this action: 
A. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory 
Planning and Review and Executive 
Order 13563: Improving Regulation and 
Regulatory Review 
This action is not a significant 
regulatory action as defined in 
Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, 
October 4, 1993) and was therefore not 
submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) for review. 
B. Executive Order 14192: Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation 
This action is not an Executive Order 
14192 regulatory action because this 
action is not significant under Executive 
Order 12866. 
C. Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) 
This action does not impose an 
information collection burden under the 
PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) because it 
does not contain any information 
collection activities. 
D. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
This action is certified to not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities 
under the RFA (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). 
This action approves the delegation of 
federal rules as requested by the state 
agency and will therefore have no net 
regulatory burden for all directly 
regulated small entities. 
E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
(UMRA) 
This action does not contain an 
unfunded mandate as described in 
UMRA, 2 U.S.C. 1531–1538, and does 
not significantly or uniquely affect small 
governments. This action imposes no 
enforceable duty on any State, local, or 
tribal governments or the private sector. 
F. Executive Order 13132: Federalism 
This action does not have federalism 
implications as specified in Executive 
Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 
1999). It will not have substantial direct 
effects on the states, on the relationship 
between the national government and 
the states, or on the distribution of 
power and responsibilities among the 
various levels of government. 
G. Executive Order 13175: Consultation 
and Coordination With Indian Tribal 
Governments 
This final approval to update the 
delegation of certain NSPS to LDEQ and 
the approval of LDEQ’s request to 
update their NESHAP delegation will 
not apply in areas of Indian Country, 
and therefore has no tribal implications 
as specified in Executive Order 13175 
(65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). This 
action will neither impose substantial 
direct compliance costs on federally 
recognized tribal governments, nor 
preempt tribal law. This action will not 
impose substantial direct compliance 
costs on federally recognized tribal 
governments because no actions will be 
required of tribal governments. This 
action will also not preempt tribal law 
as no Louisiana tribe implements a 
regulatory program under the CAA and 
thus does not have applicable or related 
tribal laws. 
H. Executive Order 13045: Protection of 
Children From Environmental Health 
Risks and Safety Risks 
The EPA interprets Executive Order 
13045 as applying only to regulatory 
actions considered significant under 
section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866 
and that concern environmental health 
or safety risks that EPA has reason to 
believe may disproportionately affect 
children, per the definition of ‘‘covered 
regulatory action’’ in section 2–202 of 
Executive Order 13045. This action is 
not subject to Executive Order 13045 
because it approves a state action 
implementing a federal standard. 
I. Executive Order 13211: Actions 
Concerning Regulations That 
Significantly Affect Energy Supply, 
Distribution or Use 
This action is not subject to Executive 
Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 
2001), because it is not a significant 
regulatory action under Executive Order 
12866. 
J. National Technology Transfer and 
Advancement Act (NTTAA) 
This rulemaking does not involve 
technical standards. This action is not 
subject to requirements of section 12(d) 
of the National Technology Transfer and 
Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 
272 note) because application of those 
requirements would be inconsistent 
with the Clean Air Act.

This action is subject to the CRA, and 
the EPA will submit a rule report to 
each House of the Congress and to the 
Comptroller General of the United 
States. This action is not a ‘‘major rule’’ 
as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2). 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 
petitions for judicial review of this 
action must be filed in the United States 
Court of Appeals for the appropriate 
circuit by February 17, 2026. Filing a 
petition for reconsideration by the 
Administrator of this final rule does not 
affect the finality of this action for the 
purposes of judicial review nor does it 
extend the time within which a petition 
for judicial review may be filed and 
shall not postpone the effectiveness of 
such rule or action. This action may not 
be challenged later in proceedings to 
enforce its requirements. (See section 
307(b)(2).)

RIN 1004–AF52 
Federal Onshore Oil and Gas 
Statewide Bonds; Extension of Phase- 
In Deadline 
AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. 
ACTION: Direct final rule; request for comments. 
SUMMARY: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM, we) is issuing this 
direct final rule (DFR) to amend BLM 
regulations to extend the phase-in date 
for compliance with the minimum bond 
amount for Statewide oil and gas bonds. 
The current regulation requires 
operators to increase or replace existing 
Statewide bonds to meet the $500,000 
minimum bond amount by June 22, 
2026. This rule extends that deadline to 
June 22, 2027, aligning it with the 
phase-in date for individual lease 
bonds. 
DATES: The final rule is effective on February 17, 2026, unless significant 
adverse comments are received by 
January 20, 2026. If significant adverse 
comments are received, notice will be 
published in the Federal Register before 
the effective date either withdrawing the 
rule or issuing a new final rule that 
responds to any significant adverse 
comments. 
ADDRESSES: You may submit comments by one of the following methods: 
€Federal eRulemaking Portal: https://www.regulations.gov. In the Search box, enter the Docket Number 
‘‘BLM–2025–0269’’ and click the 
‘‘Search’’ button. Follow the 
instructions at this website.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Peter Cowan, Senior Minerals Leasing 
Specialist, email: picowan@blm.gov; 
telephone: 720–838–1641. Individuals 
in the United States who are deaf, 
deafblind, hard of hearing, or have a 
speech disability may dial 711 (TTY, 
TDD, or TeleBraille) to access 
telecommunications relay services. 
Individuals outside the United States 
should use the relay services offered 
within their country to make 
international calls to the point-of- 
contact in the United States. 
For a summary of the final rule, 
please see the abstract description of the 
document in Docket Number BLM– 
2025–0269 on www.regulations.gov. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Oil and gas leasing on Federal lands managed by 
the BLM is governed by the Mineral 
Leasing Act of 1920 (MLA), 30 U.S.C. 
181 et seq., and other pertinent statutes. The BLM published a final rule on April 
23, 2024 (89 FR 30916) that, among 
other topics, updated bonding 
requirements for Federal onshore oil 
and gas operations, including increases 
to the minimum bond amounts and 
phase-in deadlines for when operators 
must update their existing bonds. Under 
43 CFR 3104.1(c)(1), operators must 
bring existing Statewide bonds into 
compliance with the increased bond 
amount by June 22, 2026. This DFR will 
extend the deadline to comply with the 
existing Statewide bond requirement 
from June 22, 2026, to June 22, 2027. 
That is the same deadline for individual 
lease bonds in 43 CFR 3104.1(c)(2). 
The BLM seeks to delay this 
requirement as we are pursuing a 
separate but related rulemaking in the 
coming months, which could 
significantly change the timeline for this 
requirement. This delay will provide 
operators with relief while the BLM 
pursues this change. 
This rule is consistent with broader 
energy policy goals, as reflected in 
Executive Order (E.O.) 14154, 
‘‘Unleashing American Energy’’ (90 FR

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES159070 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Rules and Regulations 8353, Jan. 20, 2025), and E.O. 14156, 
‘‘Declaring a National Energy 
Emergency’’ (90 FR 8433, Jan. 20, 2025), 
which emphasize: 
€Reducing regulatory burdens on domestic energy producers; 
€Promoting energy independence through expanded access to Federal 
lands; 
€Streamlining compliance timelines to avoid unnecessary disruptions to 
operations; and 
€Encouraging capital investment in exploration and production by 
minimizing near-term financial strain. 
Extending the Statewide bond phase- 
in deadline aligns with these priorities 
by providing operators with additional 
time to secure financing or to 
restructure bonding instruments. It also 
ensures parity between Statewide and 
lease-level bonding compliance, 
simplifying implementation and 
reducing confusion. 
This action reflects the Department of 
the Interior’s commitment to regulatory 
certainty, economic growth, and 
responsible resource development. It 
does not alter the minimum bond 
amounts. 
Procedural Matters 
Executive Order (E.O.) 12866— 
Regulatory Planning and Review and 
E.O. 13563—Improving Regulation and 
Regulatory Review 
E.O. 12866 provides that the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs 
(OIRA) in the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) will review all significant 
rules. OIRA has determined that this 
rule is not significant. 
E.O. 13563 reaffirms the principles of 
E.O. 12866, while calling for 
improvements in the Nation’s regulatory 
system to promote predictability, reduce 
uncertainty, and use the best, most 
innovative, and least burdensome tools 
for achieving regulatory ends. E.O. 
13563 directs agencies to consider 
regulatory approaches that reduce 
burdens and maintain flexibility and 
freedom of choice for the public where 
these approaches are relevant, feasible, 
and consistent with regulatory 
objectives. E.O. 13563 emphasizes 
further that agencies must base 
regulations on the best available science 
and that the rulemaking process must 
allow for public participation and an 
open exchange of ideas. The Department 
developed this rule in a manner 
consistent with these requirements. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA, 
5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) requires an 
agency to prepare a regulatory flexibility 
analysis for all rules unless the agency 
certifies that the rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
The RFA applies only to rules for which 
an agency is required to first publish a 
proposed rule. See 5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 
604(a). As the Department is not 
required to publish a notice of proposed 
rulemaking for this DFR, the RFA does 
not apply. 
Congressional Review Act 
This rule is not a major rule under the 
Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 
804(2). Specifically, the DFR: (a) will 
not have an annual effect on the 
economy of $100 million or more; (b) 
will not cause a major increase in costs 
or prices for consumers, individual 
industries, Federal, State, or local 
government agencies, or geographic 
regions; and (c) will not have significant 
adverse effects on competition, 
employment, investment, productivity, 
innovation, or on the ability of U.S.- 
based enterprises to compete with 
foreign-based enterprises in domestic 
and export markets. 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
This rule does not impose an 
unfunded mandate on State, local, or 
Tribal governments, or the private 
sector, of more than $100 million per 
year. The rule does not have a 
significant or unique effect on State, 
local, or Tribal governments, or the 
private sector. The rule merely extends 
the deadline for complying with the 
increased Statewide bond requirement. 
Therefore, a statement containing the 
information required by the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 1531 et 
seq.) is not required. 
E.O. 12630—Governmental Actions and 
Interference With Constitutionally 
Protected Property Rights 
This rule does not result in a taking 
of private property or otherwise have 
regulatory takings implications under 
E.O. 12630. The rule merely extends an 
existing phase-in period. The rule will 
not result in private property being 
taken for public use without just 
compensation because this rule only 
extends the compliance deadline for an 
existing Statewide bond requirement. A 
takings implication assessment is 
therefore not required. 
E.O. 13132—Federalism 
Under the criteria of section 1 of E.O. 
13132, this rule does not have sufficient 
federalism implications to warrant the 
preparation of a federalism summary 
impact statement. This rule will not 
have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the 
national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. A federalism 
summary impact statement is not 
required. 
E.O. 12988—Civil Justice Reform 
This DFR complies with the 
requirements of E.O. 12988. Among 
other things, this rule: 
(a) Meets the criteria of section 3(a) 
requiring that all regulations be 
reviewed to eliminate errors and 
ambiguity and be written to minimize 
litigation; 
(b) Meets the criteria of section 3(b)(2) 
requiring that all regulations be written 
in clear language and contain clear legal 
standards. 
E.O. 13175—Consultation and 
Coordination With Indian Tribal 
Governments 
The Department of the Interior strives 
to strengthen its government-to- 
government relationship with Indian 
Tribes through a commitment to 
consultation with Tribes and 
recognition of their right to Tribal self- 
governance and sovereignty. The 
Department evaluated this DFR under 
E.O. 13175 and the Department’s 
consultation policies. The Department 
determined that this DFR has no 
substantial, direct effects on federally 
recognized Indian Tribes and that 
consultation under the Department’s 
Tribal consultation policies is not 
required. The rule merely revises the 
Federal regulations to extend the phase- 
in date for Federal onshore Statewide 
bond amounts. 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
This rule does not impose any new 
information collection burdens under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act. OMB 
previously approved the information 
collection activities contained in the 
existing regulations and assigned OMB 
control number 1004–0185. This rule 
does not impose an information 
collection burden because the 
Department is not making any changes 
to the information collection 
requirements. 
National Environmental Policy Act 
This DFR does not constitute a major 
Federal action significantly affecting the 
quality of the human environment. A 
detailed statement under the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA, 42 
U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) is not required 
because this rule is covered by a 
categorical exclusion applicable to 
regulatory functions ‘‘that are of an

46.210(i). In addition, the Department 
has determined that this rule does not 
involve any of the extraordinary 
circumstances listed in 43 CFR 46.215 
that would require further analysis 
under NEPA. 
E.O. 13211—Actions Concerning 
Regulations That Significantly Affect 
Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use 
This DFR is not a significant energy 
action as defined in E.O. 13211. 
Therefore, a statement of energy effects 
is not required.

Ensuring Consistent and Rigorous 
Standards for Senior Executive Service 
Candidate Development Programs 
AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposes to revise 
its Senior Executive Service (SES) 
Candidate Development Program 
(SESCDP) regulations to implement 
certain SES training and development 
requirements. The SES represents the 
Federal Government’s leadership, 
composed of executive positions above 
the GS–15 level. SESCDPs serve as a 
crucial succession management tool for 
Federal agencies, designed to identify 
and prepare high-potential employees 
for future roles within the SES. These 
programs aim to cultivate leaders 
equipped with a government-wide 
perspective and the competencies 
necessary to tackle complex challenges.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
The Senior Executive Service (SES) is 
a corps of top-level Federal executives 
who provide leadership and oversee 
government operations, bridging the gap 
between political appointees and career 
civil servants. The SES was established 
by the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) 
of 1978 and became effective in July 
1979. The CSRA envisioned a senior 
executive corps with solid executive 
expertise, public service values, and a 
broad perspective of the Government. 
The CSRA established the SES as a 
distinct personnel system that applies 
the same executive qualifications 
requirements to all members. The 
system was designed to provide greater 
authority to agencies to manage their 
executive resources, including the 
flexibility for selecting and developing 
Federal executives within a framework 
that preserves the larger corporate 
interests of the Government. 
An SESCDP is a structured program 
designed to identify and prepare 
individuals who aspire to become senior 
executive leaders, exhibit readiness or 
near-readiness for executive-level 
responsibilities, demonstrate leadership 
across organizational boundaries, and 
show potential to manage complex, 
cross-agency initiatives. As a strategic 
succession tool, SESCDPs serve to 
strengthen selected candidates’ 
leadership skills and characteristics 
based on current standards. 
Participation provides governmentwide 
leadership opportunities to interact with 
senior employees outside their 
department and/or agency, interagency 
training experiences, executive-level 
development assignments, mentoring, 
and coaching. Further, an SESCDP 
boosts participants’ executive 
competencies and expands their 
understanding of governmentwide 
programs and issues beyond their 
individual agency and profession, 
broadening participants’ understanding 
of missions, programs, core values, and 
management challenges. 
Graduates of an OPM-approved 
SESCDP, who are selected through civil 
service-wide competition and are 
certified by OPM’s Qualifications 
Review Board (QRB), may receive a 
career SES appointment without further 
competition. The QRB certifies the 
executive qualifications of candidates 
for initial career SES appointments. 
QRB members judge the overall scope, 
quality, and depth of a candidate’s 
executive qualifications and experience 
within the context of the Executive Core 
Qualifications. QRB certification does 
not guarantee placement in the SES, and 
SESCDP participation is not required for 
selection into the SES. 
On October 30, 2004, the President 
signed the Federal Workforce Flexibility 
Act of 2004 (Act), Public Law 108–411, 
into law. The Act made several 
significant changes in the law governing 
the training and development of Federal 
employees, supervisors, managers, and 
executives. The first change required 
each agency to evaluate, on a regular 
basis, its training programs and plans 
with respect to the accomplishment of 
its specific performance plans and 
strategic goals, and to modify its 
training plans and programs as needed 
to accomplish the agency’s performance 
plans and strategic goals. 
The second major change the Act 
required was for agencies to consult 
with OPM to establish comprehensive 
succession management programs 
designed to provide training to 
employees to develop managers for the 
agency. It also required agencies, in 
consultation with OPM, to establish 
programs to provide training to 
managers regarding actions, options, 
and strategies a manager may use in 
relating to employees with unacceptable 
performance, mentoring employees, 
improving employee performance and 
productivity, and conducting employee 
performance appraisals. 
On January 20, 2025, President Trump 
issued a Presidential Memorandum

OPM, ‘‘Hiring and Talent Development for the 
Senior Executive Service’’ (May 29, 2025), available 
at https://www.chcoc.gov/content/hiring-and- 
talent-development-senior-executive-service.

Id. 
titled ‘‘Restoring Accountability for 
Career Senior Executives.’’ 90 FR 8481, 
January 30, 2025. With this Presidential 
Memorandum, President Trump 
directed agencies to ‘‘reinvigorate the 
SES system and prioritize 
accountability’’ to ensure proper 
accountability to both the President and 
the American people. The Presidential 
Memorandum further directed the 
Director of OPM, in coordination with 
the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, to reassign 
agency SES members as needed to 
ensure alignment between their 
knowledge, skills, abilities, and mission 
assignments and the President’s agenda. 
To advance this directive, on May 29, 
2025, OPM released the memorandum, 
Hiring and Talent Development for the 
Senior Executive Service,
1
which 
provides policy, guidance, and 
timelines to agencies on SES hiring and 
development, to include new SESCDP 
certification requirements. The 
memorandum noted that ‘‘these changes 
in hiring, training, development and 
oversight will drive a cultural shift in 
the SES.’’ The memorandum further 
highlights that Federal agencies are 
responsible for ensuring appropriate 
succession planning for executive 
positions by building a pipeline of 
qualified candidates that are well- 
prepared to serve as Federal executives, 
and that ‘‘OPM is required to establish 
programs for the systematic 
development of candidates for the SES 
and/or assist agencies in the 
establishment of such programs which 
meet OPM prescribed criteria.’’ 
Through the introduction of more 
stringent SESCDP certification 
requirements, OPM aims to enhance 
training and development for aspiring 
SES and accelerate the placement of 
well-prepared leaders to ensure 
leadership continuity. OPM has 
reviewed evaluation feedback from 
agencies and graduates of SESCDPs over 
the years, which suggest some 
adjustments can be made to enhance the 
experience for SESCDP participants and 
aim for better outcomes. To accomplish 
this transformation, OPM proposes to 
adjust the formal training content, adopt 
a more streamlined program cohort 
duration, and utilize developmental 
assignments of a longer minimum 
duration. In turn, agencies will have a 
more appropriate timeframe to conduct 
an SESCDP and allow for aspiring SES 
to learn in an environment that 
promotes governmentwide cohesion and 
prepares them to deliver results as 
accountable senior executives. 
Proposed Changes in This Rulemaking 
OPM has reviewed the supervisory, 
management and executive 
development regulations governing the 
SESCDP and is issuing this proposed 
rule in response to the President’s 
directives and pursuant to its regulatory 
authority in 5 U.S.C. 3396 (a) and (b). 
The following are the principal results 
sought by the proposed changes to 5 
CFR part 412: 
ÆAgencies have effective and cost- efficient SESCDPs that will support 
agency succession planning and 
candidate development; 
ÆAgencies identify and select individuals that have demonstrated 
executive ability and further develop 
them professionally to step into the SES 
with the experiences to handle the 
challenges presented at the highest 
caliber of public service; 
ÆAgencies maintain a minimum placement rate of program graduates 
receiving OPM QRB certification as 
determined by OPM policy to ensure a 
return on investment; and 
ÆAgencies are better equipped to collect SESCDP evaluation data to 
identify and implement program 
enhancements or alternative approaches 
to improve program administration. 
To assist agencies in accomplishing 
these results, we are proposing changes 
to 5 CFR part 412, subpart C ‘‘Senior 
Executive Service Candidate 
Development Programs.’’ In addition to 
modifying §§ 412.301 and 412.302, OPM 
also proposes to add a new § 412.303 to 
address SESCDP oversight and 
evaluation. The following are the major 
proposed changes in part 412, subpart 
C: 
§ 412.301 
Section 412.301 provides the 
requirements for an agency to obtain 
approval from OPM to conduct an 
SESCDP. OPM proposes to add a 
requirement for each Department or 
Agency HQ-level seeking approval to 
submit a blanket, enterprise-wide policy 
for itself and all subcomponents. OPM 
also proposes to prescribe program 
policy parameters and require agencies 
to use an OPM-provided program policy 
template when applying for program 
and policy approval. The template 
submission process streamlines program 
creation by standardizing most elements 
and aligning all policies across agencies 
for uniformity. The proposal would 
amend § 412.301(b) to require a 
participating agency to include in its 
policy a description of SESCDP program 
methodologies, modifications, and 
improvements by using the OPM- 
developed SESCDP policy template, as 
well as program evaluation templates. 
Further, the proposal would also require 
agencies to obtain OPM re-approval for 
an SESCDP on a triennial basis to 
ensure alignment and strategic linkage 
with agency succession plans. 
OPM has directed all agencies that 
currently operate SESCDPs to ensure 
alignment with the new Administration 
policies. OPM also directed that, no 
later than October 31, 2025, those 
agencies must submit updated policies 
for OPM review and approval.
2
 
Agencies must submit all updated 
policies using the OPM-developed 
template but may need to submit policy 
modifications if there are any changes in 
the final rule. OPM policy approvals 
will occur within 30 days after the final 
rule date, and agencies cannot begin 
new program cohorts until their new 
policy has been approved by OPM. 
§ 412.302 
Section 412.302 provides the criteria 
for an SESCDP. Currently, SESCDPs 
must be a minimum of 12 months and 
can run up to 24 months. This length of 
time involves considerable expense and 
resources to ostensibly turn ‘‘almost 
ready’’ talent into ‘‘ready now’’ talent. 
OPM proposes to limit program cohort 
duration from a minimum of 9 months 
to a maximum of 12 months. 
Additionally, to allow flexibility based 
on extenuating circumstances, agencies 
may be granted by OPM an extension of 
program cohort length up to 15 months 
for the affected participant(s). This 
reduced duration serves as part of a re- 
envisioned SESCDP to more effectively 
identify and prepare ‘‘almost ready’’ 
talent and decrease the time needed for 
high-potential executive talent to reach 
optimal performance. 
Current SESCDPs must provide at 
least 80 hours of formal interagency or 
multi-sector training experience. OPM 
proposes to increase this to 100 hours of 
formal training which must include 
topics identified by the agencies that 
best serve the development of their 
participants and must also include topic 
areas specific to: strategic planning, 
financial management, human resource 
management, government efficiency, 
management and supervision, and 
accountability. Targeted training in the 
above-specified areas will serve to 
improve leadership skills such as 
decision-making, communicating, 
problem-solving, and adaptability. The 
number of specific hours allocated to 
each of these topics is at the discretion 
of the agencies.

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with PROPOSALS159074 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Proposed Rules OPM proposes that participants in an 
agency SESCDP must receive at least 
two validated executive assessments 
(i.e., structured evaluation tools that have been scientifically tested to ensure 
they reliably measure specific 
competencies, behaviors, or traits 
relevant to executive leadership). The 
first assessment must be conducted at 
selection, and a second assessment must 
be conducted during the program 
cohort. An agency would be required to 
consider the results of the first 
assessment in its evaluation of which 
candidates are best suited to participate 
in an SESCDP. Similarly, agencies 
would be required to use the in-program 
assessment results to identify and 
adjust, as needed, areas of continuing 
development for SESCDP participants 
while they progress through their 
program cohort. 
Finally, OPM proposes to require a 
minimum 10 hours each of coaching 
and mentoring and to require at least 
one developmental assignment of 120 
continuous days outside the scope of 
the candidate’s position of record and 
require the assignments to include roles 
at the executive level where the 
candidate is held responsible for 
achieving organizational or agency 
results during the developmental 
assignment. The purpose of the new 
developmental assignment provision is 
to enhance and broaden the candidate’s 
experience, increase his or her 
knowledge, and maximize his or her 
understanding of the overall functioning 
of the agency, so the candidate is 
prepared for a range of agency positions 
at the SES level. 
§ 412.303 
OPM proposes to add a Program 
Evaluation requirement. Agencies 
would be required to implement 
programmatic changes based on that 
feedback. Each SESCDP would be 
required to obtain re-approval from 
OPM based on demonstrated program 
effectiveness. 
Expected Impact of This Rulemaking 
A. Statement of Need 
OPM is issuing this proposed rule 
pursuant to its authority to issue 
regulations governing the development 
for and within the SES in 5 U.S.C. 3396. 
Succession planning, through the 
identification of high performers, 
coupled with enhanced leadership 
preparation and development, plays a 
critical part in agency mission success. 
Building a pipeline of high performing 
GS–14s, 15s, and equivalents equipped 
with the skills, knowledge, technical 
expertise, and strategic mindset 
necessary to excel in senior leadership 
roles is crucial. Therefore, in order to 
build and maintain this ‘‘ready now’’ 
pipeline, a reformed SESCDP, focused 
and targeted, is needed and will 
contribute to increased succession 
readiness, particularly through the 
strategic placement of program 
graduates who receive OPM SES QRB 
certification. These prescribed changes 
will also drive a shift in the culture of 
the SES and implement more impactful 
SES training and development 
requirements. 
Inconsistencies among SESCDPs have 
yielded mixed results across 
participating agencies. That variability 
has resulted in different training and 
development experiences for SESCDP 
participants and leads to some programs 
that are more effective than others in 
preparing their leaders. This causes 
fluctuating levels of candidate 
placement rates and creates challenges 
in supporting government-wide 
succession planning efforts. 
Additionally, OPM and agencies lack 
visibility on standardized government- 
wide program data. The absence of 
consistent metrics prevents OPM and 
agencies from comparing results across 
programs and assessing the impact and 
value to SESCDP participants and the 
government. 
B. Impact 
SESCDPs are designed to strengthen 
executive core qualifications (ECQ) 
competencies for selected high- 
performing aspiring executives through 
a demanding learning and 
developmental experience. An SESCDP 
provides candidates with 
governmentwide leadership challenges, 
opportunities to interact with senior 
employees outside their assigned 
department and/or agency, interagency 
training experiences, executive-level 
development assignments, mentoring, 
and coaching. 
This experience boosts participants’ 
executive competencies and expands 
their understanding of governmentwide 
programs and issues beyond their 
individual agency of assignment and 
their profession, broadening 
participants’ understanding of missions, 
programs, core values, and management 
challenges. Utilizing an SESCDP can 
support an agency’s talent management 
and succession planning efforts through 
building an equipped pipeline of ‘‘ready 
now’’ aspiring leaders. This allows 
senior agency leaders to make strategic 
and timely placements to improve 
performance, accomplish agency 
mission, and effectively provide 
services to the American public. 
The proposed program changes will 
add a more unified structure to the 
SESCDPs and ensure a more aligned 
cadre of graduates through this 
succession management track. 
Templated program areas, from policy 
to program evaluations, will allow for a 
more integrated comparison of programs 
over time, allowing decision makers to 
further tailor the programs to meet the 
needs of agencies governmentwide and 
fully aligned with incumbent SES 
demonstrated leadership competencies. 
Ultimately, by increasing program 
standards and training requirements, an 
SESCDP will better equip program 
participants to excel in senior 
leadership roles and effectively 
implement the President’s agenda. This 
will not only increase the President’s 
confidence in the ability of the 
Executive Branch to serve the Nation 
but also build trust with the American 
people. 
C. Costs 
This proposed rule would affect the 
operations of the 13 Federal agencies 
that currently have an OPM-approved 
SESCDP policy—ranging from cabinet- 
level departments to small independent 
agencies. There are also two other 
Federal agencies that previously 
informed OPM that they would be 
submitting a SESCDP policy for 
approval. We estimate that this rule 
would require individuals employed by 
these agencies to spend time creating an 
updated SESCDP policy—whether 
updating their current SESCDP policy or 
creating a policy to start a new 
SESCDP—to reflect the updated 
program structure and administration. 
There would also be potential cost 
savings for the two sub-level agencies 
that have currently approved SESCDP 
policies as, moving forward, they would 
fall under their top-level agency policy. 
Typically, an agency’s Executive 
Resources or Training and Development 
staff handles tasks associated with 
overseeing the management of SESCDP 
policies and programs. Therefore, for 
this cost analysis, OPM assumes the 
average salary rate of Federal employees 
performing this work will be the rate in 
2025 for GS–14, step 5, in the 
Washington, DC, locality pay table 
($161,486 annual locality rate and 
$77.38 hourly locality rate). Typically, 
there are two types of roles who oversee 
the administration of an SESCDP— 
program managers and program 
coordinators—and their combined time 
would average the equivalent of one 
FTE at this grade level. We assume the 
total dollar value of labor, which 
includes wages, benefits, and overhead, 
is equal to 200 percent of the wage rate,

Management & Society for Industrial and 
Organizational Psychology. 2015. 
resulting in an assumed labor cost of 
$154.76 per hour. 
To comply with the regulatory 
changes in the proposed rule, affected 
agencies would need to review the rule 
and update their policies and 
procedures. We estimate that, in the first 
year following publication of a final 
rule, this would require an average of 
100 hours of work by employees with an 
average hourly cost of $154.76 per hour. 
Accounting for the 11 agencies with 
current approved policies, and the two 
agencies planning to submit for initial 
policy approval, this would result in 
estimated costs of about $15,000 per 
agency, or about $200,000 total. Further, 
because federal agencies are not 
required to obtain an OPM-approved 
SESCDP policy, each additional agency 
that decides to apply for a policy 
approval would equal an estimated cost 
of $15,000 per agency. For the second 
and third years of having an approved 
policy, agencies would see a cost 
savings of $15,000 each year, as the 100 
hours of work to review the rule and 
update policies would not be required. 
However, following the third year, this 
cost would be incurred again when the 
agency must submit a policy re- 
approval. 
When calculating other operational 
program costs per SESCDP participant, 
OPM estimates the average number of 
participants per program is about 25 
participants per cohort. In addition, 
when calculating program costs for the 
assessment of applicants, OPM 
estimates that the assessments would be 
administered to those applicants on the 
Best Qualified list, which we estimate to 
be 40 people per cohort. 
These additional program costs would 
include the increase in formal training 
hours, the addition of a second 
validated executive assessment, and the 
addition of 10 coaching hours to 
develop a candidate at the executive 
level. The current average cost of a 
formal training hour per SESCDP 
participant is $150. By adding 20 more 
formal training hours, the cost of this 
program element increases the cost per 
participant by $3,000. The current 
average cost of administering one 
validated executive assessment is $350 
per assessment. Typically, these 
assessments require the results to be 
interpreted to the participant by a 
professional, adding additional cost. 
Adding a second assessment for use 
during the program is an additional 
$350. Finally, the cost of external 
coaching services can range anywhere 
from $200 to $3,000 per hour. However, 
when identifying sources that provide 
the level of professional expertise and 
coaching services needed to support 
SESCDP participants, it was estimated 
to cost approximately $1,000 per hour. 
However, to offset costs pertaining to 
coaching requirements, agencies can 
utilize federal coaches (i.e., graduates of the Federal Internal Coaching Training 
Program) certified in providing coaching 
services and administering feedback on 
assessments used by the agency. Of the 
11 agencies currently holding policies, 
and the two agencies that have 
expressed interest in obtaining an 
approved policy, eight have formal 
programs that offer coaching to 
employees. If these agencies utilize their 
certified internal coaches to provide this 
service, the cost of adding the coaching 
requirement into the SESCDP could be 
reduced by approximately $3 million 
each year across government. 
Additionally, agencies that do not have 
coaching programs can partner with 
OPM to identify and utilize federal 
coaches through the Federal Coaching 
Network (FCN). The FCN is a 
community of individuals across the 
federal government who are invested in 
the practice of coaching and support its 
role in leadership development. 
Furthermore, by leveraging a multi- 
agency OPM-approved SESCDP policy, 
these agencies can partner with those 
that do have a formal coaching program 
to combine and share resources. For 
agencies who are able to leverage 
internal coaching services, it is 
estimated that the combined costs for 
new training and development 
requirements would be approximately 
$152,000 per agency. For agencies who 
must or choose to leverage external 
coaching services, that cost would 
increase to approximately $402,000 per 
agency. 
It is also important to note that the 
recruitment and hiring costs to onboard 
an SES can vary from agency to agency. 
OPM anticipates that the SESCDPs 
under this revised framework will more 
reliably produce high-caliber SES 
candidates that are ready to step into 
SES positions. This proposed rule 
would require a minimum level of 
SESCDP graduate placement rate of 
participants set by OPM as evaluation 
criteria, reflecting the improved 
effectiveness of the OPM-approved 
SESCDPs. OPM expects that this would 
allow agencies to realize cost savings, as 
they could offset SES recruitment and 
hiring costs by increasing the amount of 
SESCDP graduates placed in vacant 
executive positions. 
OPM anticipates that total costs for 
agencies who are able to leverage the 
internal savings mentioned above would 
be an estimated $167,000 per agency, or 
$2.2M across all participating agencies. 
If all participating agencies must, or 
choose, to leverage external 
developmental services or resources, 
that cost would increase to 
approximately $417,000 per agency, or 
$5.4M total. 
D. Benefits 
The standardization of program 
policies will save time for agencies by 
reducing policy drafting and approval 
timelines. Decreasing the program 
cohort duration allows for a more 
expedited timeline of identifying near 
ready talent and preparing them fully to 
fill SES vacancies. Common practice in 
program evaluation allows for 
measuring the individual SESCDP 
participant input on program outcomes, 
and the standardized feedback will 
allow for easier comparison from 
program to program. Additionally, 
adding an organizational standard 
evaluation feedback tool provides an 
opportunity for the impact to be 
measured more easily for return on 
investment to the organization, as 
referenced by Njah et al., which can aid 
in continued decisions about the 
impacts that the program outcomes have 
on the organization.

Utilization of validated assessments 
during the recruitment process would 
support agencies in identifying those 
candidates who are on the cusp of 
becoming senior executives and that are 
best suited to participate in an SESCDP. 
Further, use of an assessment—such as 
a 360-degree assessment—during the 
course of the SESCDP will also provide 
valuable feedback to candidates, 
especially when used as a part of the 
coaching relationship. Because this kind 
of assessment provides feedback from a 
variety of perceptions, coaches can 
utilize feedback, ‘‘. . . to bring a 
measure of objectivity and structure to 
the coaching engagement.’’
4
The 
frequency of coaching sessions can be 
prescribed using the common practice 
of meeting once per month as is typical 
with a leadership or executive coach. 
Therefore, a nine-month SESCDP would 
account for 9 hours of coaching and also 
allow for 1 hour focusing on providing 
assessment feedback. This structure is 
supported by research from DiGirolamo, 
who discusses the benefits of using 
coaching as a tool in leadership

‘‘[i]ndividualized attention in coaching 
will bring a laser-sharp focus on unique 
strengths and growth opportunities.’’ 
E. Regulatory Alternatives 
An alternative to this rulemaking is to 
not modify current regulatory program 
requirements and instead issue further 
OPM guidance encouraging agencies to 
be increasingly rigorous in their 
management of their SESCDPs. OPM 
could recommend that agencies 
incorporate these changes as promising 
or best practices, with the goal to 
increase program oversight, 
participation, and performance. 
However, previous attempts to achieve 
this result through recommendations 
and informal guidance to agencies have 
not been successful and, instead, have 
allowed agencies to continue to modify 
program methodologies, resulting in 
varying program policies and results. 
According to feedback from agencies 
with approved policies, program 
managers and coordinators have 
consistently suggested that OPM 
standardize improved program 
requirements so that their SESCDPs 
would be more aligned. Therefore, 
solidifying the requirements through 
OPM-developed templates would 
reduce the burden on agencies and 
would help produce consistent data 
points for comparison to ensure quality 
implementation of SESCDPs 
government wide. Additionally, this 
will help provide universal datapoints 
to agency leadership to illustrate the 
effectiveness of an agency’s SESCDP, 
how it compares to other agency 
programs, and ensure program 
accountability to produce measurable 
high-quality, timely, and cost-effective 
results. 
Request for Comments 
OPM requests comments on the 
implementation and potential impacts 
of this proposed rule. Such information 
will be useful for better understanding 
the effect of this amendment on 
SESCDP. The type of information in 
which OPM is interested includes, but 
is not limited to, the following: 
€What research should OPM consider regarding the time 
requirements allotted for training, 
mentoring, and coaching in addition to 
what has been mentioned? 
€Should OPM prescribe a specific number of hours for each of the 
proposed training topics listed in 
§ 412.302? Should the number of hours 
be equally allocated to each topic, or 
should agencies have the flexibility to 
ensure each topic is appropriately 
covered? 
€What is the benefit of expanding executive assessments on the 
effectiveness of development programs? 
€What promising practices have similar executive development 
programs in the private sector adopted? 
How have they impacted talent 
management and succession planning 
efforts? 
€What additional executive development research should be 
considered regarding proposed changes 
to these elements of the regulation? 
In the final rule, OPM may adopt 
changes from the proposed 
requirements based on the information 
it receives in response to these 
questions. 
Regulatory Compliance 
A. Regulatory Review 
OPM has examined the impact of this 
rule as required by E.O.s 12866 and 
13563, which direct agencies to assess 
all costs and benefits of available 
regulatory alternatives and, if regulation 
is necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, 
environmental, public, health, and 
safety effects, distributive impacts, and 
equity). A regulatory impact analysis 
must be prepared for rules that have an 
annual effect on the economy of $100 
million or more or adversely affect in a 
material way the economy, a sector of 
the economy, productivity, competition, 
jobs, the environment, public health or 
safety, or State, local, or tribal 
governments or communities. This 
rulemaking does not reach that 
threshold but has otherwise been 
designated a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ under section 3(f) of Executive 
Order 12866. This rule is not expected 
to be an E.O. 14192 regulatory action 
because it imposes no more than de 
minimis costs. 
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Director of OPM certifies that this 
rulemaking will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities because it will 
apply only to Federal agencies and 
employees. 
C. Federalism 
This rulemaking will not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, 
on the relationship between the 
National Government and the States, or 
on distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. Therefore, in 
accordance with Executive Order 13132, 
it is determined that this proposed rule 
does not have sufficient federalism 
implications to warrant preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 
D. Civil Justice Reform 
This rulemaking meets the applicable 
standards set forth in section 3(a) and 
(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988. 
E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 
1995 
Section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) 
requires that agencies assess anticipated 
costs and benefits before issuing any 
rule that would impose spending costs 
on State, local, or tribal governments in 
the aggregate, or on the private sector, 
in any 1 year of $100 million in 1995 
dollars, updated annually for inflation. 
That threshold is currently 
approximately $206 million. This 
rulemaking will not result in the 
expenditure by State, local, or tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector, in excess of the 
threshold. Thus, no written assessment 
of unfunded mandates is required. 
F. Paperwork Reduction Act 
This regulatory action will not impose 
any reporting or recordkeeping 
requirements under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act. 
List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 412 
Education, Government employees. 
Accordingly, for the reasons stated in 
the preamble, OPM proposes to amend 
5 CFR part 412 as follows: 
PART 412—SUPERVISORY, 
MANAGEMENT, AND EXECUTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT 
1. The authority citation for part 412 
is revised to read as follows: 
Authority: 5 U.S.C. 1103(c)(2)(C), 3396, 3397, and ch. 41. 
Subpart C—Senior Executive Service 
Candidate Development Programs 
2. Amend § 412.301 by revising 
paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) to read as 
follows: 
§ 412.301 Obtaining approval to conduct a 
Senior Executive Service candidate 
development program (SESCDP). 
* * * * * 
(b) An agency covered by 5 U.S.C., 
chapter 31, subchapter II, may apply to 
OPM to conduct an SESCDP alone or on 
behalf of a group of agencies. (In this 
subpart, the term ‘‘agency’’ refers to 
either a single agency or a group of 
agencies acting in partnership under 
this subpart.) Any agency developing an 
SESCDP must submit a single 
overarching policy document to OPM

implementing the SESCDP. Agencies 
must use the OPM-developed SESCDP 
policy template to describe program 
methodologies. 
(c) An agency must seek OPM re- 
approval (see § 412.303) on a triennial 
basis and must also consult OPM before 
implementing a change substantially 
altering how the SESCDP complies with 
the requirements of this regulation. 
OPM re-approval must be obtained 
before an agency initiates a new 
SESCDP. 
(d) An approved SESCDP policy will 
serve as an umbrella program policy and 
establish enterprise-wide requirements 
for the entire agency. An agency with an 
OPM-approved SESCDP policy may 
authorize a major agency component or 
subcomponent employing senior 
executives to conduct an SESCDP. The 
major agency component or 
subcomponent must utilize and adhere 
to the approved agency policy when 
administering an individual SESCDP 
cohort. 
* * * * * 
3. Amend § 412.302 by revising 
paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) to read as 
follows: 
§ 412.302 Criteria for a Senior Executive 
Service candidate development program 
(SESCDP). 
(a) Executive Resources Board requirements. An agency’s Executive Resources Board (ERB) must oversee the 
SESCDP. The ERB ensures the 
development program both complies 
with the requirements of paragraph (c) 
of this section and includes substantive 
developmental experiences that should 
equip a successful candidate to 
accomplish Federal Government 
missions as a senior executive. The 
agency ERB must oversee and be 
accountable for SESCDP recruitment, 
merit staffing, and assessment. The 
agency ERB must ensure the program 
follows SES merit staffing provisions in 
5 CFR 317.501, subject to the condition 
explained in § 412.302(d)(1). The ERB 
also must oversee development, 
evaluation, progress in the program, and 
graduation of candidates, and submit for 
QRB review within 80 calendar-days of 
graduation those candidates determined 
by the ERB to possess the executive core 
qualifications. The ERB must also 
oversee the writing and implementation 
of a removal policy for program 
candidates who do not make adequate 
progress. 
(b) Recruitment. (1) Consistent with the merit system 
principles in 5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(1) and (2), 
agencies must ensure that recruitment 
for the program is from all groups of 
qualified individuals within the civil 
service, or all groups of qualified 
individuals whether or not within the 
civil service. 
(2) The number of expected SES 
vacancies must be considered as one 
factor in determining the number of 
selected candidates, and agencies, to the 
maximum extent possible, should 
ensure program participation includes 
candidates from outside of the agency. 
(3) Agencies must require each 
applicant to complete one validated 
executive assessment during the 
program application process and each 
SESCDP participant to complete at least 
one additional validated executive 
assessment during the course of the 
SESCDP. Agencies must consider the 
results of the assessment conducted 
during the application process in 
identifying those candidates who are 
best suited to participate in an SESCDP. 
Agencies must use the in-program 
assessment results to identify and 
adjust, as needed, areas of continuing 
development for each SESCDP 
participant while they progress through 
the program cohort. 
(c) Senior Executive Service candidate development program requirements. An 
SESCDP program cohort must last a 
minimum of nine months but must not 
exceed twelve months in duration. To 
graduate, a candidate must accomplish 
the requirements of the program 
established by his or her agency. An 
SESCDP must include each of the 
following elements for each SESCDP 
participant: 
(1) A documented development plan 
based upon a competency-based needs 
determination and approved by the 
agency ERB. The candidate must utilize 
the OPM-standardized Executive 
Development Plan (EDP) template, 
which will: 
(i) Address the executive core 
qualifications (ECQs); 
(ii) Address Federal Government 
leadership challenges crucial to the 
senior executive; 
(iii) Provide increased knowledge and 
understanding of the overall functioning 
of the agency, so the participant is 
prepared for a range of positions and 
responsibilities; 
(iv) Include interaction with senior 
employees outside the candidate’s 
department or agency to foster a broader 
perspective; and 
(v) Address Governmentwide or 
multi-agency applicability in the nature 
and scope of the training; 
(2) A formal interagency and/or multi- 
sector training experience lasting at 
least 100 hours that, at a minimum, 
addresses the topics of strategic 
planning, financial management, human 
capital management, human resource 
management, government efficiency, 
management and supervision, and 
accountability. The number of specific 
hours allocated to each training topic is 
at the discretion of the agency. The 
agency may add additional agency- 
specific training topics as appropriate 
and any additional topics prescribed 
through OPM guidance and policy. The 
training experience must include 
interaction with senior employees 
outside the candidate’s department or 
agency. 
(3) A developmental assignment of at 
least 120 continuous days of full-time 
service to a position other than, and 
substantially different from, the 
candidate’s position of record. The 
assignment must include executive- 
level responsibility and differ from the 
candidate’s current and past 
assignments in ways that broaden the 
candidate’s experience, as well as 
challenge the candidate with respect to 
leadership competencies and the ECQs. 
Assignments need not be restricted to 
the agency, the Executive Branch, or the 
Federal Government, so long as they can 
be accomplished in compliance with 
applicable law and Federal and agency- 
specific ethics regulations. The 
candidate is held accountable for 
organizational or agency results 
achieved during the assignment. If the 
assignment is in a non-Federal 
organization, the ERB must provide for 
adequate documentation of the 
individual’s actions and 
accomplishments and must determine 
the assignment will contribute to 
development of the candidate’s 
executive qualifications. 
(4) A mentor who is a member of the 
SES or is otherwise determined by the 
ERB to have the knowledge and capacity 
to advise the candidate, consistent with 
goals of the SESCDP. The mentor and 
the candidate are jointly responsible for 
a productive mentoring relationship and 
are required to meet for a minimum of 
10 hours during the course of the 
SESCDP. However, the agency should 
establish methods to assess these 
relationships and, if necessary, facilitate 
them or make appropriate changes in 
the interest of the candidate. 
(5) A leadership or executive-level 
coach who is certified with an 
accredited coaching organization and is 
determined by the ERB to have the 
knowledge and capacity to advise the 
candidate, consistent with the goals of 
the SESCDP. The coach and the 
candidate are jointly responsible for a 
productive coaching relationship and 
are required to meet for a minimum of 
10 hours during the course of the 
SESCDP. However, the agency must

5. Add § 412.303 to read as follows: 
§ 412.303 Senior Executive Service 
candidate development program (SESCDP) 
oversight and evaluation. 
(a) Agencies must complete and 
maintain program evaluations pursuant 
to training evaluation requirements in 5 
CFR 410.202 and must use OPM- 
developed evaluation templates for 
completion, respectively, by individual 
SESCDP participants and agency 
program managers: 
(1) Upon completion of each 
individual SESCDP cohort; 
(2) Annually for the overarching 
SESCDP; and 
(3) To collect evaluation data for the 
purpose of identifying and 
implementing program enhancements or 
alternative approaches to program 
administration. 
(b) To seek OPM re-approval of an 
SESCDP policy, an agency must submit 
its current program policy and 
completed overarching program 
evaluation template. Evaluations must 
include initial SES placement rates for 
graduates who receive a QRB 
certification and demonstrate that the 
agency maintains a minimum placement 
rate as required by OPM policy and 
guidance. Individual participant 
program cohort evaluation templates are 
not required for re-approval; however, 
OPM reserves the right to request 
templates for each individual cohort 
during the current approval period.

Airworthiness Directives; Airbus 
Helicopters Deutschland GmbH (AHD) 
Helicopters 
AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 
SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all 
Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH 
(AHD) Model MBB–BK 117 A–1, MBB– 
BK 117 A–3, MBB–BK 117 A–4, MBB– 
BK 117 B–1, MBB–BK 117 B–2, and 
MBB–BK 117 C–1 helicopters. This 
proposed AD was prompted by a report 
of a main rotor head (MRH) having the 
same part number (P/N) and serial 
number (S/N) as another MRH due to 
incorrect modification instructions 
where the modified part serial number 
was not re-identified and the MRH can 
be operated with the wrong associated 
log card if accidently interchanged. This 
proposed AD would require performing 
a one-time consistency check of the P/ 
N and S/N of the MRH, performing 
corrective actions if applicable, 
determining if the MRH has been 
modified, and re-identifying the 
modified MRH. The proposed AD 
would also allow replacing the MRH as 
an optional action and would prohibit 
the installation of an affected MRH on 
any helicopter. The FAA is proposing 
this AD to address the unsafe condition 
on these products. 
DATES: The FAA must receive comments on this NPRM by February 2, 2026.

Background 
EASA, which is the Technical Agent 
for the Member States of the European 
Union, issued EASA AD 2025–0028, 
dated February 7, 2025 (EASA AD 
2025–0028) (also referred to as the 
MCAI), to correct an unsafe condition 
on Airbus Helicopters Deutschland 
GmbH Model MBB–BK117 A–1, MBB– 
BK117 A–3, MBB–BK117 A–4, MBB– 
BK117 B–1, MBB–BK117 B–2, and 
MBB–BK117 C–1 helicopters. The MCAI 
states that an occurrence was reported 
of two MRHs having an identical P/N 
and S/N. The MCAI further states that 
a subsequent investigation determined 
that the duplicate identification was due 
to incorrect modification instructions 
for the MRH in an Airbus Helicopters 
service information notice where the 
modified part serial number was not re- 
identified; this could result in the MRH 
being operated with the wrong 
associated log card if incorrectly 
interchanged. This condition, if not 
detected and corrected, could result in 
operation of an MRH and its critical 
parts beyond certified limits and lead to 
failure of certain parts and consequent 
loss of control of the helicopter. 
You may examine the MCAI in the 
AD docket at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA–2025–5393. 
Material Incorporated by Reference 
Under 1 CFR Part 51 
The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2025– 
0028, which specifies procedures for a 
one-time consistency check of the P/N 
and S/N of the MRH to verify against the 
existing helicopter log card or 
equivalent record and, depending on the 
results, contacting Airbus Helicopters 
for approved instructions. EASA AD 
2025–0028 also specifies procedures for 
performing an additional check of the 
existing helicopter log card or 
equivalent record to determine if the 
MRH has been modified and procedures 
for re-identifying an MRH that has been 
modified. EASA AD 2025–0028 allows 
replacing the MRH with a serviceable 
part in accordance with the instructions 
of the applicable Aircraft Maintenance 
Manual as an optional action to 
accomplishing the initial consistency 
check and the corrective actions. EASA 
AD 2025–0028 prohibits installing an 
affected MRH on any helicopter. 
This material is reasonably available 
because the interested parties have 
access to it through their normal course 
of business or by the means identified 
in the 
ADDRESSESsection. 
FAA’s Determination 
These products have been approved 
by the civil aviation authority (CAA) of 
another country and are approved for 
operation in the United States. Pursuant 
to the FAA’s bilateral agreement with 
this State of Design Authority, it has 
notified the FAA of the unsafe condition 
described in the MCAI referenced 
above. The FAA is issuing this NPRM 
after determining that the unsafe 
condition described previously is likely 
to exist or develop on other products of 
the same type design. 
Proposed AD Requirements in This 
NPRM 
This proposed AD would require 
accomplishing the actions specified in 
EASA AD 2025–0028, described 
previously, as incorporated by 
reference, except for any differences 
identified as exceptions in the 
regulatory text of this proposed AD. See 
‘‘Differences Between this Proposed AD 
and the MCAI’’ for a general discussion 
of these differences. 
Differences Between This Proposed AD 
and the MCAI 
Where the MCAI specifies contacting 
Airbus Helicopters for repair 
instructions, this proposed AD would 
require using a method approved by the 
FAA, EASA, or Airbus Helicopters’ 
EASA Design Organization Approval. 
Explanation of Required Compliance 
Information 
In the FAA’s ongoing efforts to 
improve the efficiency of the AD 
process, the FAA developed a process to 
use some CAA ADs as the primary 
source of information for compliance 
with requirements for corresponding 
FAA ADs. The FAA has been 
coordinating this process with 
manufacturers and CAAs. As a result, 
the FAA proposes to incorporate EASA 
AD 2025–0028 by reference in the FAA 
final rule. This proposed AD would, 
therefore, require compliance with 
EASA AD 2025–0028 in its entirety 
through that incorporation, except for 
any differences identified as exceptions 
in the regulatory text of this proposed 
AD. Using common terms that are the 
same as the heading of a particular 
section in EASA AD 2025–0028 does 
not mean that operators need comply 
only with that section. For example, 
where the AD requirement refers to ‘‘all 
required actions and compliance times,’’ 
compliance with this AD requirement is

Title 49 of the United States Code 
specifies the FAA’s authority to issue 
rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, 
section 106, describes the authority of 
the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: 
Aviation Programs, describes in more 
detail the scope of the Agency’s 
authority. 
The FAA is issuing this rulemaking 
under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 
44701: General requirements. Under 
that section, Congress charges the FAA 
with promoting safe flight of civil 
aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
regulations for practices, methods, and 
procedures the Administrator finds 
necessary for safety in air commerce. 
This regulation is within the scope of 
that authority because it addresses an 
unsafe condition that is likely to exist or 
develop on products identified in this 
rulemaking action. 
Regulatory Findings 
The FAA determined that this 
proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 
13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the 
States, on the relationship between the 
national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
For the reasons discussed above, I 
certify this proposed regulation: 
(1) Is not a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ under Executive Order 12866, 
(2) Would not affect intrastate 
aviation in Alaska, and 
(3) Would not have a significant 
economic impact, positive or negative, 
on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act.

The Proposed Amendment 
Accordingly, under the authority 
delegated to me by the Administrator, 
the FAA proposes to amend 14 CFR part 
39 as follows: 
PART 39—AIRWORTHINESS 
DIRECTIVES 
1. The authority citation for part 39 
continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701. § 39.13 [Amended] 
2. The FAA amends § 39.13 by adding 
the following new airworthiness 
directive: 
Airbus Helicopters Deutschland GmbH 
(AHD): Docket No. FAA–2025–5393; Project Identifier MCAI–2025–00157–R. 
(a) Comments Due Date 
The FAA must receive comments on this 
airworthiness directive (AD) by February 2, 
2026. 
(b) Affected ADs 
None. 
(c) Applicability 
This AD applies to Airbus Helicopters 
Deutschland GmbH (AHD) Model MBB–BK 
117 A–1, MBB–BK 117 A–3, MBB–BK 117 
A–4, MBB–BK 117 B–1, MBB–BK 117 B–2, 
and MBB–BK 117 C–1 helicopters, 
certificated in any category. 
(d) Subject 
Joint Aircraft System Component (JASC) 
Code 6220, Main Rotor Head. 
(e) Unsafe Condition 
This AD was prompted by a report of a 
main rotor head (MRH) having the same part 
number (P/N) and serial number (S/N) as 
another MRH due to incorrect modification 
instructions where the modified part S/N was 
not re-identified and the MRH can be 
operated with the wrong associated log card 
if accidently interchanged. The FAA is 
issuing this AD to detect and correct the 
incorrect identification of S/Ns and P/Ns on 
MRHs which, if not addressed, could result 
in operation of an MRH and its critical parts 
beyond certified limits and lead to failure of 
certain parts and consequent loss of control 
of the helicopter. 
(f) Compliance 
Comply with this AD within the 
compliance times specified, unless already 
done. 
(g) Requirements 
Except as specified in paragraphs (h) and 
(i) of this AD: Comply with all required 
actions and compliance times specified in, 
and in accordance with, European Union 
Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD 2025– 
0028, dated February 7, 2025 (EASA AD 
2025–0028). 
(h) Exceptions to EASA AD 2025–0028

(2) Where EASA AD 2025–0028 requires 
compliance in terms of flight hours, this AD 
requires using hours time-in-service. 
(3) Where paragraphs (2) and (4) of EASA 
AD 2025–0028 specify discrepancy, for the 
purposes of this AD, a discrepancy can be 
defined as the serial number on the MRH 
[Main Rotor Head] not matching the serial 
number on the helicopters existing log card 
or equivalent record. 
(4) Where the material referenced in EASA 
AD 2025–0028 specifies ‘‘check’’, this AD 
requires replacing that text with ‘‘inspect’’. 
(5) Where EASA AD 2025–0028 and the 
material referenced in EASA AD 2025–0028 
specifies ‘‘MRH log card’’, this AD requires 
replacing that text with ‘‘existing helicopter 
log card or equivalent record’’. 
(6) Where EASA AD 2025–0028 or the 
referenced material specifies to contact AH 
[Airbus Helicopters] to obtain approved 
instructions, or specifies a part is eligible for 
installation in accordance with AH 
instructions, this AD requires those actions 
done in accordance with a method approved

Incorporation by Reference 
Class D and Class E airspace are 
published in paragraphs 5000 and 6005 
of FAA Order JO 7400.11, Airspace 
Designations and Reporting Points, 
which is incorporated by reference in 14 
CFR 71.1 on an annual basis. This 
document proposes to amend the 
current version of that order, FAA Order 
JO 7400.11K, dated August 4, 2025, and 
effective September 15, 2025. These 
updates would be published 
subsequently in the next update to FAA 
Order JO 7400.11. FAA Order JO 
7400.11K, which lists Class A, B, C, D, 
and E airspace areas, air traffic service 
routes, and reporting points, is publicly 
available as listed in the 
ADDRESSES 
section of this document. 
The Proposal 
The FAA is proposing an amendment 
to 14 CFR part 71 that would modify the 
Class D airspace and establish Class E 
airspace extending upward from 700 
feet above the surface at Chandler, 
Arizona, and Phoenix, Arizona, due to 
biennial airspace reviews. 
For the Chandler Municipal Airport, 
Chandler, AZ, Class D airspace the 
proposal would: (1) increase the radius 
from 4 miles to 4.8 miles; (2) increase 
the vertical limit from 3,000 feet MSL to 
3,700 feet MSL; (3) remove Williams 
Gateway Airport and the associated 
exclusion area as they are no longer 
required; (4) add an exclusion area west 
of 111°5341 W; (5) update the airspace legal description header from ‘‘Chandler 
Municipal Airport, AZ’’ to ‘‘Chandler, 
AZ’’ to comply with changes to FAA 
Order JO 7400.2R, Procedures for 
Handling Airspace Matters; and (6) 
update the outdated term of ‘‘Airport/ 
Facility Directory’’ to ‘‘Chart 
Supplement.’’ 
For the Mesa Gateway Airport, 
Phoenix, AZ, the proposal would: (1) 
increase the radius from 5 miles to 5.4 
miles; (2) add an exclusion area for the 
Chandler Municipal Airport Class D 
airspace; (3) add an exclusion area 
within a 1.2-mile radius of Pegasus 
Airpark, Queen Creek, AZ; (4) update 
the name of the airport from Williams 
Gateway Airport to Mesa Gateway 
Airport and update the geographic 
coordinates of the airport to coincide 
with the FAA’s aeronautical database; 
(5) update the airspace legal description 
header from ‘‘Chandler, AZ’’ to 
‘‘Phoenix, AZ’’ to coincide with the 
FAA’s aeronautical database; and (6) 
update the outdated term of ‘‘Airport/ 
Facility Directory’’ to ‘‘Chart 
Supplement.’’ 
This action proposes to establish 
Class E airspace extending upward from 
700 feet above the surface at Stellar 
Airport, Chandler, AZ, within a 13.9- 
mile radius of the airport. 
This action proposes to establish 
Class E airspace extending upward from 
700 feet above the surface at Mesa 
Gateway Airport, Phoenix, AZ; (1) 
within a 7.9-mile radius of the airport; 
(2) within 4 miles northeast and 8 miles 
southwest of the 136° bearing for the Mesa Gateway: RWY 30C–LOC 
extending from the 7.9-mile radius of 
the airport to 17.7 miles southeast of the 
Mesa Gateway: RWY 30C–LOC; (3) and 
within 7.9 miles northeast and 4 miles 
southwest of the 136° bearing from the airport extending from the 7.9-mile 
radius of the airport to 12.6 miles 
southeast of the airport. 
This action is the result of biennial 
airspace reviews at these airports, 
would support IFR operations, and 
bring the airspace into compliance with 
current FAA orders. 
Regulatory Notices and Analyses 
The FAA has determined that this 
proposed regulation only involves an 
established body of technical 
regulations for which frequent and 
routine amendments are necessary to 
keep them operationally current. It, 
therefore: (1) is not a ‘‘significant 
regulatory action’’ under Executive 
Order 12866; (2) is not a ‘‘significant 
rule’’ under DOT Regulatory Policies 
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 
26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant 
preparation of a regulatory evaluation as 
the anticipated impact is so minimal. 
Since this is a routine matter that will 
only affect air traffic procedures and air 
navigation, it is certified that this 
proposed rule, when promulgated, will 
not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. 
Environmental Review 
This proposal will be subject to an 
environmental analysis in accordance 
with FAA Order 1050.1G, ‘‘FAA 
National Environmental Policy Act 
Implementing Procedures’’ prior to any 
FAA final regulatory action.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 
SUMMARY: This action proposes to amend the Class E airspace extending 
upward from 700 feet above the surface 
at Morganton, NC, by expanding the 
airspace to encompass Carolinas 
Healthcare System Blue Ridge, 
Morganton, NC. It would also update 
the name of the former Morganton- 
Lenoir Airport to Foothills Regional 
Airport, Morganton, NC, as the airport 
has changed its name. Finally, it would 
remove the Grace Hospital reference 
along with the point in space 
coordinates, as Grace Hospital no longer 
exists. Controlled airspace is necessary 
for the safety and management of 
instrument flight rules (IFR) operations 
at this airport.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Authority for This Rulemaking 
The FAA’s authority to issue rules 
regarding aviation safety is found in 
Title 49 of the United States Code. 
Subtitle I, Section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. 
Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the 
agency’s authority. This rulemaking is 
promulgated under the authority 
described in Subtitle VII, Part A, 
Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that 
section, the FAA is charged with 
prescribing regulations to assign the use 
of airspace necessary to ensure the 
safety of aircraft and the efficient use of 
airspace. This regulation is within the 
scope of that authority, as it would 
amend Class E airspace in Morganton, 
NC. 
Comments Invited 
The FAA invites interested persons to 
participate in this rulemaking by 
submitting written comments, data, or 
views. Comments are specifically 
invited on the overall regulatory, 
aeronautical, economic, environmental, 
and energy-related aspects of the 
proposal. The most helpful comments 
reference a specific portion of the 
proposal, explain the reason for any 
recommended change, and include 
supporting data. To ensure the docket 
does not contain duplicate comments, 
commenters should submit only one 
time if comments are filed 
electronically, or commenters should 
send only one copy of written 
comments if comments are filed in 
writing. 
The FAA will file in the docket all 
comments it receives, as well as a report 
summarizing each substantive public 
contact with FAA personnel concerning 
this proposed rulemaking. Before acting 
on this proposal, the FAA will consider 
all comments it receives on or before the

will consider comments filed after the 
comment period has closed if it is 
possible to do so without incurring 
expense or delay. The FAA may change 
this proposal in light of the comments 
it receives. 
Privacy: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(c), DOT solicits comments from the 
public to better inform its rulemaking 
process. DOT posts these comments, 
without edits, including any personal 
information the commenter provides, to

Incorporation by Reference 
Class E airspace designations are 
published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA 
Order JO 7400.11, Airspace 
Designations and Reporting Points, 
which is incorporated by reference in 14 
CFR 71.1 on an annual basis. This 
document proposes to amend the 
current version of that order, FAA Order 
JO 7400.11K, Airspace Designations and 
Reporting Points, dated August 4, 2025, 
and effective September 15, 2025. These 
updates would be published in the next 
update to FAA Order JO 7400.11. FAA 
Order JO 7400.11K, which lists Class A, 
B, C, D, and E airspace areas, air traffic 
service routes, and reporting points, is 
publicly available as listed in the 
ADDRESSESsection of this document. 
The Proposal 
The FAA proposes an amendment to 
14 CFR part 71 to modify Class E 
airspace by expanding the Class E 
airspace extending upward from 700 
feet above the surface within a 7-mile 
radius of the Carolinas Healthcare 
System Blue Ridge, Morganton, NC. It 
would also update the airport name 
from the former Morganton-Lenoir 
Airport, Morganton, NC, to Foothills 
Regional Airport, Morganton, NC, as the 
airport has changed its name. 
Additionally, it would update the 
coordinates for Foothills Regional 
Airport, Morganton, NC, to reflect its 
most accurate coordinates. Finally, it 
would remove Grace Hospital along 
with its Point in Space Coordinates, as 
that hospital no longer exists. 
Controlled airspace is necessary for the 
safety and management of instrument 
flight rules (IFR) operations in the area. 
Regulatory Notices and Analyses 
The FAA has determined that this 
proposed regulation only involves an 
established body of technical 
regulations for which frequent and 
routine amendments are necessary to 
keep them operationally current. It, 
therefore, (1) is not a ‘‘significant 
regulatory action’’ under Executive 
Order 12866; (2) is not a ‘‘significant 
rule’’ under Department of 
Transportation (DOT) Regulatory 
Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; 
February 26, 1979); and (3) does not 
warrant preparation of a regulatory 
evaluation as the anticipated impact is 
so minimal. Since this is a routine 
matter that will only affect air traffic 
procedures and air navigation, it is 
certified that this proposed rule, when 
promulgated, will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities under the 
criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
Environmental Review 
This proposal will be subject to an 
environmental analysis in accordance 
with FAA Order 1050.1G, ‘‘FAA 
National Environmental Policy Act 
Implementing Procedures,’’ prior to any 
final regulatory action by the FAA.

Reclamation Plan 
II. Description of the Proposed Amendment 
III. Public Comment Procedures 
IV. Statutory and Executive Order Review 
I. Background on the North Dakota 
Reclamation Plan 
OSMRE’s Abandoned Mine Land 
Reclamation Program was established 
by title IV of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1201 et 
seq.), in response to concerns over 
extensive environmental damage caused 
by coal mining activities prior to the 
enactment of SMCRA. Traditionally, 
this program has been funded primarily 
by a reclamation fee collected by 
OSMRE on each ton of coal that is 
produced. The money is placed in the 
Federal Abandoned Mine Reclamation 
Fund and is distributed to States and 
Tribes with approved reclamation plans 
as grants to be used to finance the 
reclamation of coal mines abandoned 
before the enactment of SMCRA and left 
in an unreclaimed or inadequately 
reclaimed condition and for certain 
other purposes. 
Section 405 of the Act (30 U.S.C. 
1235) allows States and Tribes to 
assume exclusive responsibility for 
AML reclamation activity on lands 
within their jurisdiction if they develop 
and submit to the Secretary of the 
Interior for approval, a reclamation plan 
for the reclamation of abandoned coal 
mines. On the basis of these criteria, the 
Secretary of the Interior conditionally 
approved the North Dakota Abandoned 
Mine Plan on July 27, 1992. You can 
find background information on the 
North Dakota plan, including the 
Secretary’s findings, the disposition of 
comments, and conditions of approval 
of the North Dakota program in the July 
27, 1992, Federal Register (57 FR 
33116). 
II. Description of the Proposed 
Amendment 
By letter dated September 10, 2025 
(Administrative Record No. ND–058– 
01), North Dakota sent us an 
amendment to its plan under SMCRA 
(30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.). Through Senate 
bill 2117 (SB 2117), North Dakota 
proposed changes to chapter 38–14.2 of 
the North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) 
in response to the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act (Pub. L. 117– 
58), the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, 2023 (Pub. L. 117–328), and 
changes to title 30, chapter VII, 
subchapter R of the Code of Federal 
Regulations. 
This proposed amendment updates 
the purposes for which the North 
Dakota abandoned mine reclamation 
fund may be used and creates a set-aside 
trust account in the State treasury. The 
definition of eligible lands and water 
and project priorities are also revised. 
The full text of the plan amendment is 
available for you to read at the locations 
listed above under 
ADDRESSESor at 
www.regulations.gov. 
III. Public Comment Procedures 
We are seeking your comments on 
whether the amendment satisfies the 
applicable plan approval criteria of 30 
CFR 884.14 and 884.15. If we approve 
the amendment, it will become part of 
the North Dakota reclamation plan. 
Electronic or Written Comments 
If you submit written or electronic 
comments on the proposed rule during 
the 30-day comment period, they should 
be specific, confined to issues pertinent 
to the proposed regulations, and explain 
the reason for any recommended 
change. We appreciate any and all 
relevant comments, but those most 
useful and likely to influence decisions 
on the final regulations will be those 
that either involve personal experience 
or include citations to and analyses of 
SMCRA, its legislative history, its 
implementing regulations, case law, 
other pertinent State or Federal laws or 
regulations, technical literature, or other 
relevant publications. 
We cannot ensure that comments 
received after the close of the comment 
period (see 
DATES) or sent to an address 
other than those listed (see 
ADDRESSES) 
will be included in the docket for this 
rulemaking and considered.

In the first two of these instances, the 
Commission put in place interim reporting 
requirements to enable it to evaluate the effect of 
these changes on SPM’s accuracy, reliability, and 
representativeness, and also to evaluate whether 
any revisions to the Commission’s service 
performance reporting requirements with respect to 
measurement exclusions are necessary. See Docket Nos. RM2024–9 and PI2025–2, Interim Order 
Regarding Proposed Service Performance 
Measurement Changes, March 28, 2025, at 22–23, 
37–39, 40–41 (Order No. 8761). These reporting

the hearing. If no one requests an 
opportunity to speak, we will not hold 
a hearing. 
To assist the transcriber and ensure an 
accurate record, we request, if possible, 
that each person who speaks at the 
public hearing provide us with a written 
copy of his or her comments. The public 
hearing will continue on the specified 
date until everyone scheduled to speak 
has been given an opportunity to be 
heard. If you are in the audience and 
have not been scheduled to speak and 
wish to do so, you will be allowed to 
speak after those who have been 
scheduled. We will end the hearing after 
everyone scheduled to speak and others 
present in the audience who wish to 
speak, have been heard. 
Public Meeting 
If only one person requests an 
opportunity to speak, we may hold a 
public meeting rather than a public 
hearing. If you wish to meet with us to 
discuss the amendment, please request 
a meeting by contacting the person 
listed under 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION 
CONTACT. All such meetings are open to 
the public and, if possible, we will post 
notices of meetings at the locations 
listed under 
ADDRESSES. We will make 
a written summary of each meeting a 
part of the administrative record. 
IV. Statutory and Executive Order 
Review 
Executive Order 12866—Regulatory 
Planning and Review and Executive 
Order 13563—Improving Regulation 
and Regulatory Review 
Executive Order 12866 provides that 
the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs in the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) will review all significant 
rules. Pursuant to OMB guidance, dated 
October 12, 1993 (OMB Memo M–94–3), 
the approval of reclamation plan 
amendments is exempted from OMB 
review under Executive Order 12866. 
Other Laws and Executive Orders 
Affecting Rulemaking 
When a State submits a plan 
amendment to OSMRE for review, our 
regulations at 30 CFR 884.14 and 
884.15, and agency policy require 
public notification and an opportunity 
for public comment. We accomplish this 
by publishing a notice in the Federal 
Register indicating receipt of the proposed amendment and its text or a 
summary of its terms. 
We will conclude our review of the 
proposed amendment after the close of 
the public comment period and will 
determine whether the amendment 
should be approved, approved in part, 
or not approved. At that time, we will 
also make the determinations and 
certifications required by the various 
laws and executive orders governing the 
rulemaking process and include them in 
the final rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Table of Contents 
I. Background 
II. Basis of Proposed Rules 
III. Proposed Rules 
I. Background 
The Postal Accountability and 
Enhancement Act (PAEA) enhanced the 
Commission’s role in overseeing how 
the Postal Service reports information.
1
 
The PAEA requires the Commission to 
prescribe the content and form of the 
public reports that the Postal Service 
files with the Commission under section 
3652. 39 U.S.C. 3652(e)(1). The 
Commission may initiate proceedings to 
improve the quality, accuracy, or 
completeness of Postal Service reporting 
whenever the Commission determines 
that service performance data have 
become significantly inadequate, could 
be significantly improved, or otherwise 
requires revision as necessitated by the 
public interest. 39 U.S.C. 3652(e)(2). 
The PAEA introduced new 
requirements that led to the Postal 
Service developing service standards (a 
delivery day range and business rules), 
service performance goals (on-time 
percent targets), and service 
performance measurement systems. 
Following a multi-year evaluation 
process, on July 5, 2018, the 
Commission approved the use of the 
Internal Service Performance 
Measurement (SPM) System.
2
In doing 
so, the Commission found the 
applicable standard for use of an 
internal service performance 
measurement system to be whether the 
system is capable of reporting accurate, 
reliable, and representative service 
performance data. Id. at 15. From a design perspective, SPM is significantly 
more complex than the measurement 
systems that preceded it. In recent 
months, the Postal Service has three 
times given the Commission notice of 
substantial planned changes to the SPM

Postal Service Reform Act of 2022, Public Law 
117–108, 136 Stat. 1127 (2022). 
The recent enactment of the Postal 
Service Reform Act of 2022 (PSRA) 
codified a requirement for the Postal 
Service to set reasonable performance 
targets for each product and to provide 
those targets to the Commission for the 
Commission to evaluate compliance 
each year.

II. Basis of Proposed Rules 
Pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 503, 3652, 3653, 
3691, and 3692, the Commission 
proposes revisions to the service 
performance reporting rules at 39 CFR 
part 3055, subpart A. 
First, the Commission proposes 
revisions to existing sections 3055.4 and 
3055.5 to more specifically address 
changes to internal service performance 
measurement systems. These revisions 
would establish a burden of proof that 
proposed changes to such systems 
would be required to meet and would 
prevent the Postal Service from 
implementing changes without prior 
Commission approval. They would also 
codify the Commission’s existing 
authority to initiate a proceeding to 
review such systems at any time, and 
would implement a procedure whereby 
interested persons could petition the 
Commission to initiate such a 
proceeding. 
Second, the Commission proposes 
revisions to existing section 3055.5 to 
require the Postal Service to begin 
providing notice of all changes to 
service standard delivery day ranges 
and changes to origin/destination ZIP 
Code pairs that affect the number of 
days to delivery, at least 30 days prior 
to implementation. 
Third, the Commission proposes 
revisions to existing sections 3055.6 and 
3055.7 in recognition of the PSRA’s 
requirement that the Postal Service 
establish and file with the Commission 
reasonable performance targets, which 
the Commission must use to evaluate 
compliance for each product. 39 U.S.C. 
3692(a). The Postal Service would be 
required to provide sufficient 
information about the criteria used to 
select the targets for the Commission to 
be able to determine, by a 
preponderance of the evidence, that the 
targets are, in fact, reasonable. 
The Commission finds that each of 
these revisions should improve the 
quality of service performance data and 
further the public interest. 39 U.S.C. 
3652(e)(2)(B)–(C). 
III. Proposed Rules 
List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 3055 
Administrative practice and 
procedure, Reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements. 
For the reasons stated in the 
preamble, the Commission proposes to 
amend 39 CFR part 3055 as follows: 
PART 3055—SERVICE 
PERFORMANCE AND CUSTOMER 
SATISFACTION REPORTING 
1. The authority citation for part 3055 
is revised to read as follows: 
Authority: 39 U.S.C. 503, 3622, 3651, 3652, 3653, 3691, 3692, 3705. 
Subpart A—Annual Reporting of 
Service Performance Achievements 
2. Revise § 3055.4 to read as follows: 
§ 3055.4 Internal service performance 
measurement systems. 
(a) Service performance 
measurements obtained from internal 
service performance measurement 
systems or hybrid service performance 
measurement systems (which are 
defined as systems that rely on both an 
internal and an external measurement 
component) shall not be used to comply 
with any reporting requirement under 
subparts A or B of this part without 
prior Commission approval. 
(b) The Postal Service shall file notice 
with the Commission describing any 
proposed changes to internal or hybrid 
service performance measurement 
systems (including proposed changes to 
any associated reporting methodologies 
or the use of proxies). In proposing such 
changes, the Postal Service must 
demonstrate, by a preponderance of the 
evidence, that internal or hybrid service 
performance measurement systems will 
be capable of producing accurate, 
reliable, representative, and useful 
service performance data and results. 
The Commission may summarily 
dismiss (without prejudice to refiling) 
any proposal that fails to include this 
information. The Postal Service’s 
proposal must specify any planned 
implementation date(s), any requested 
decision date(s), and the reasons 
therefor. Preponderance of the evidence 
means proof by information that, 
compared with that opposing it, leads to 
the conclusion that the fact at issue is 
more probably true than not. 
(c) Changes to internal or hybrid 
service performance measurement 
systems proposed pursuant to paragraph 
(b) of this section may not be 
implemented without prior Commission 
approval. 
(d) The Commission may initiate a 
proceeding at any time to consider 
whether internal or hybrid service 
performance measurement systems are 
producing accurate, reliable, 
representative, and useful service 
performance data and results. Any 
interested person, including a public 
representative, may submit a petition to 
the Commission to initiate such a 
proceeding. 
3. Revise § 3055.5 to read as follows: 
§ 3055.5 Changes to external service 
performance measurement systems, 
service standards, service goals, or 
reporting methodologies. 
(a) The Postal Service shall file notice 
with the Commission describing all 
changes to external service performance 
measurement systems and service goals 
(including performance targets), 30 days 
prior to planned implementation. The 
Postal Service shall also file notice with 
the Commission describing all changes 
to reporting methodologies, including 
the use of proxies (other than reporting 
methodologies or the use of proxies 
associated with internal or hybrid 
service performance measurement 
systems as described by section 3055.4 
of this part), 30 days prior to planned 
implementation. The Commission may 
initiate a proceeding at any time to 
consider such changes if it appears that 
the changes might have a material 
impact on the accuracy, reliability, or 
utility of the reported measurement, or 
if the changes might have a material 
impact on the characteristics of the 
underlying product. 
(b) No later than 30 days before 
planned implementation of any change 
to service standard delivery day ranges 
or origin/destination ZIP Code pairs that 
affect the number of days to delivery, 
the Postal Service shall file notice with 
the Commission describing the exact 
nature and scope of implementation. 
Each notice shall use plain language to 
list all locations affected by the change 
in service standards (at the level of 
granularity of the service standard), the 
categories of affected market dominant 
products, the current service standard, 
the planned service standard, and the 
date of the planned change. If the 
change in service standards is 
associated with a Change in the Nature 
of Postal Services docket pursuant to 39 
U.S.C. 3661 and part 3020 of this 
chapter, then each notice shall be filed 
in the applicable Change in the Nature

each notice should be filed in the most 
recent Annual Compliance Report 
docket. 
4. Revise § 3055.6 to read as follows: 
§ 3055.6 Addition of new market dominant 
products or changes to existing market 
dominant products. 
Whenever the Postal Service proposes 
the addition of a new market dominant 
product or a change to an existing 
market dominant product, it also shall 
propose new or revised (as necessary) 
service performance measurement 
systems, service standards, service goals 
(including performance targets), data 
reporting elements, and data reporting 
methodologies. 
5. Revise § 3055.7 to read as follows: 
§ 3055.7 Reasonable performance targets. 
(a) Pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 3692(a)(1), 
the Postal Service shall establish 
reasonable performance targets for each 
market dominant product for each fiscal 
year and provide such targets to the 
Commission not later than 60 days after 
the beginning of the fiscal year in which 
they will apply. In setting reasonable 
performance targets, the Postal Service 
must consider and balance: 
(1) the need for each target to 
establish a clear path toward improving 
performance and enabling the provision 
of high-quality service; and 
(2) the need for each target to be 
realistically attainable considering the 
Postal Service’s network, workforce, 
transportation capacity, and financial 
resources, and actual service standards 
in effect. 
(b) The Postal Service’s filing made 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
shall contain sufficient information 
about the criteria used to select the 
targets for the Commission to be able to 
determine (based on the contents of the 
Postal Service’s filing alone), by a 
preponderance of the evidence, that the 
targets set by the Postal Service are 
reasonable. Preponderance of the 
evidence means proof by information 
that, compared with that opposing it, 
leads to the conclusion that the fact at 
issue is more probably true than not. 
(c) The Commission will use each 
reasonable target set by the Postal 
Service to evaluate compliance for each 
market dominant product for a given 
fiscal year pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 
3653(b)(2). 
By the Commission.

Secretary.

Telephone 202–480–2080; email 
smcgibbon@acus.gov. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Administrative Conference of the 
United States makes recommendations 
to federal agencies, the President, 
Congress, and the Judicial Conference of 
the United States regarding the 
improvement of administrative 
procedures (5 U.S.C. 594). The 
membership of the Conference, when 
meeting in plenary session, constitutes 
the Assembly of the Conference (5 
U.S.C. 595). 
Agenda: Subject to approval of the ACUS Council, four proposed 
recommendations will be placed on the 
agenda and considered by the 
Assembly. In addition, there will be 
updates on past, current, and pending 
initiatives, as well as other business. 
Summaries of the recommendations 
appear below: 
Temporary Rules. This proposed 
recommendation identifies best 
practices for temporary rules. 
Temporary rules cease to be effective 
after a specific calendar date or upon 
the occurrence of a future event unless 
an agency takes action to extend the 
rule, make it permanent, or repeal it. 
The proposed recommendation provides 
guidance to agencies on determining 
whether to issue a temporary rule, 
drafting and publishing temporary rules, 
conducting timely assessments of 
temporary rules and taking appropriate 
action, and developing internal 
procedures for temporary rules. It also 
recommends that Congress consider 
how specific agencies might use 
temporary rules to respond efficiently 
and effectively to emergencies. 
Obtaining Government Records for 
Use in Agency Proceedings. This 
proposed recommendation provides 
agencies with best practices for making 
federal government records available for 
use in agency proceedings. It provides 
guidance on procedures for ensuring 
that government officials and private 
parties have access to the records they 
need to participate effectively in agency 
proceedings and decide matters fairly, 
accurately, and efficiently. 
Federal Agency Collaboration with 
State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial 
Governments. This proposed recommendation provides agencies with 
a framework that federal agencies 
should use to identify and collaborate 
more effectively with relevant state, 
local, tribal, and territorial governments 
(SLTTGs). It provides guidance on 
practices agencies can adopt when 
initiating, managing, and evaluating 
collaborations with SLTTGs that 
promote a culture of improved 
coordination and strengthen working 
relationships between governments. 
Organization, Management, and 
Operation of Agency Adjudication 
Offices. This proposed recommendation provides agencies with best practices for 
organizing, managing, and operating 
agency adjudication offices. It 
encourages agencies to collect, analyze, 
and use data to identify and adopt the 
organizational, management, and 
operational practices that are best suited 
to each agency’s unique circumstances 
and most effective in promoting 
fairness, accuracy, consistency, 
efficiency, and timeliness in the 
adjudications they conduct. 
Additional information about the 
proposals and the agenda, as well as any 
changes or updates to the same, can be 
found at the 84th Plenary Session page 
on ACUS’s website prior to the start of 
the meeting: https://www.acus.gov/

Agency Information Collection 
Activities: Notice of Intent To Renew 
Collection 3038–0107, Generic 
Clearance for the Collection of 
Qualitative Feedback on Agency 
Service Delivery 
AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (‘‘Commission’’ or 
‘‘CFTC’’) is announcing an opportunity 
for public comment on the renewal of 
collection of certain information by the 
Commission’s Office of Customer 
Education and Outreach (‘‘OCEO’’). 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
(‘‘PRA’’), Federal agencies are required 
to publish notice in the Federal Register 
concerning each proposed or renewal of 
a collection of information and to allow 
60 days for public comment. The 
Commission is soliciting comments for 
the renewal of its generic information 
collection that will help the CFTC 
satisfy responsibilities under the Dodd- 
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act (‘‘Dodd-Frank Act’’), 
found in Section 748 of the Dodd-Frank 
Act. The generic information collection 
will provide the OCEO a means to 
gather qualitative consumer and 
stakeholder feedback in an efficient, 
timely manner to facilitate service 
delivery. 
DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before February 17, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: You may submit comments, identified by ‘‘Generic Clearance for the 
Collection of Qualitative Feedback on 
Agency Service Delivery,’’ and 
Collection Number 3038–0107, by any 
of the following methods: 
€The Agency’s website, at https://comments.cftc.gov/. Follow the instructions for submitting comments 
through the website.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dan Rutherford, Associate Director, Office of 
Customer Education and Outreach, 
Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, 1155 21st Street NW, 
Washington, DC 20581, (202) 418–6623; 
email: drutherford@cftc.gov, and refer to OMB Control No. 3038–0107. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA, Federal agencies must obtain 
approval from the Office of Management 
and Budget (‘‘OMB’’) for each collection 
of information they conduct or sponsor. 
‘‘Collection of Information’’ is defined 
in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3 
and includes agency requests or 
requirements that members of the public 
submit reports, keep records, or provide 
information to a third party. Section 
3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 
3506(c)(2)(A), requires Federal agencies 
to provide a 60-day notice in the 
Federal Register concerning each 
proposed collection of information, 
including each proposed extension of an

existing collection of information, 
before submitting the collection to OMB 
for approval. To comply with this 
requirement, the CFTC is publishing 
notice of the proposed collection of 
information listed below. An agency 
may not conduct or sponsor, and a 
person is not required to respond to, a 
collection of information unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control 
number. 
Title: Generic Clearance for Collection of Qualitative Feedback on Agency 
Service Delivery (OMB Control No. 
3038–0107). This is a request for an 
extension of a currently approved 
information collection. 
Abstract: In accordance with section 748 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the OCEO 
anticipates undertaking a variety of 
service delivery focused activities over 
the next few years that include 
consumer outreach and information- 
sharing with stakeholders which are 
responsive to stakeholders’ needs and 
sensitive to changes in the market. The 
proposed information collection activity 
will use similar methods for information 
collection or otherwise share common 
elements, and provide a means to gather 
qualitative customer and stakeholder 
feedback in an efficient, timely manner. 
By qualitative feedback we mean 
information that provides useful 
information on perceptions and 
opinions. The solicitation of 
information on delivery of consumer 
services will address such areas as 
appropriate messages, effective message 
delivery methods, effective event 
outreach tactics and characteristics, new 
outreach program ideas and content, 
and current consumer beliefs, 
psychographics and social norms that 
will assist the agency in developing 
outreach and communications 
campaigns. Since these systems will use 
similar methods for information 
collection or otherwise share common 
elements, the OCEO is proposing a 
generic clearance for this process, which 
will allow the OCEO to implement these 
systems and meet the obligations of the 
PRA without the delays of the normal 
clearance process. Collection methods 
may include focus groups and surveys 
as well as other relevant collection 
methods that meet the conditions 
appropriate for a generic clearance as 
outlined below. The OCEO will only 
submit a collection for approval under 
this generic clearance if it meets the 
following conditions: 
€The collections are voluntary; €The collections are low-burden for respondents (based on considerations of 
total burden hours, total number of 
respondent, or burden-hours per 
respondent) and are low-cost for both 
the respondents and the Federal 
Government; 
€The collections are non- controversial and do not raise issues of 
concern to other Federal agencies; 
€Any collection is targeted to the solicitation of opinions from 
respondents who have experience with 
the program or may have experience 
with the program in the near future; 
€Personally identifiable information (PII) is collected only to the extent 
necessary and is not retained; 
€Information gathered is intended to be used only internally for general 
service improvement and program 
management purposes and is not 
intended for release outside of the 
Commission (if released, the 
Commission must indicate the 
qualitative nature of the information); 
€Information gathered will not be used for the purpose of substantially 
informing influential policy decisions; 
and 
€Information gathered will yield qualitative information; the collections 
will not be designed or expected to 
yield statistically reliable results or used 
as though the results are generalizable to 
the population of study. 
With respect to the collection of 
information, the Commission invites 
comments on: 
€Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the 
Commission, including whether the 
information will have a practical use; 
€The accuracy of the Commission’s estimate of the burden of the proposed 
collection of information, including the 
validity of the methodology and 
assumptions used; 
€Ways to enhance the quality, usefulness, and clarity of the 
information to be collected; and 
€Ways to minimize the burdens of collection of information on those who 
are to respond, including through the 
use of appropriate automated electronic, 
mechanical, or other technological 
collection techniques or other forms of 
information technology, e.g., permitting electronic submission of responses. 
You should submit only information 
that you wish to make available 
publicly. If you wish the Commission to 
consider information that you believe is 
exempt from disclosure under the 
Freedom of Information Act, a petition 
for confidential treatment of the exempt 
information may be submitted according 
to the procedures established in § 145.9 
of the Commission’s regulations.

The Commission reserves the right, 
but shall have no obligation, to review, 
pre-screen, filter, redact, refuse or 
remove any or all of your submission 
from https://www.cftc.gov that it may deem to be inappropriate for 
publication, such as obscene language. 
All submissions that have been redacted 
or removed that contain comments on 
the merits of the Information Collection 
Request will be retained in the public 
comment file and will be considered as 
required under the Administrative 
Procedure Act and other applicable 
laws, and may be accessible under the 
Freedom of Information Act.

burden for this collection is estimated to 
be as follows: 
Type of Review: Generic Clearance 
Request. 
Affected Public/Entities: Individuals 
and Households, Businesses and 
Organization, State, Local or Tribal

Title of Collection: National 
Assessment of Educational Progress 
(NAEP) 2027. 
OMB Control Number: 1850–0928. 
Type of Review: A revision of a 
currently approved ICR. 
Respondents/Affected Public: State, 
Local, and Tribal Governments. 
Total Estimated Number of Annual 
Responses: 17,830. Total Estimated Number of Annual 
Burden Hours: 10,625. 
Abstract: The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is a 
federally authorized survey of student 
achievement at grades 4, 8, and 12 in 
various subject areas, such as 
mathematics, reading, writing, science, 
U.S. history, and civics. 
NAEP is conducted by the National 
Center for Education Statistics (NCES) 
in the Institute of Education Sciences of 
the U.S. Department of Education. NCES 
is responsible for designing and 
executing the assessment, including 
designing the assessment procedures 
and methodology, developing the 
assessment content, selecting the final 
assessment content, sampling schools 
and students, recruiting schools, 
administering the assessment, scoring 
student responses, determining the 
analysis procedures, analyzing the data, 
and reporting the results. 
The National Assessment Governing 
Board (henceforth referred to as the 
Governing Board or NAGB), appointed 
by the Secretary of Education but 
independent of the Department, is a 
bipartisan group whose members 
include governors, state legislators, local 
and state school officials, educators, 
business representatives, and members 
of the general public. The Governing 
Board sets policy for NAEP and is 
responsible for developing the 
frameworks and test specifications that 
serve as the blueprint for the 
assessments. 
NAEP consists of two assessment 
programs: the NAEP Long-term Trend 
(LTT) assessment and the main NAEP 
assessment. The LTT assessments are 
given at the national level only and are 
administered to students at ages 9, 13, 
and 17 in a manner that is very different 
from that used for the main NAEP 
assessments. LTT reports mathematics 
and reading results that present trend 
data since the 1970s. LTT does not

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159096 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices provide scores for individual students 
or schools. 
The main NAEP assessments report 
current achievement levels and trends 
in student achievement at grades 4, 8, 
and 12 for the nation and, for certain 
assessments (e.g., reading and mathematics), states and select urban 
districts (i.e., Trial Urban District Assessment, or TUDA). The main NAEP 
assessments provide results on subject- 
matter achievement, instructional 
experiences, and school environment 
for different student populations (e.g., 
all fourth-graders) and groups within 
those populations (e.g., sex [male and female students], race/ethnicity groups). 
NAEP does not provide scores for 
individual students or schools. 
The NAEP assessments contain two 
different types of items: ‘‘cognitive’’ 
assessment items, which measure what 
students know and can do in an 
academic subject, and ‘‘survey’’ or 
‘‘non-cognitive’’ items, which gather 
information such as demographic 
variables, as well as construct-related 
information, such as courses taken. The 
survey portion includes a collection of 
data from students, teachers, and school 
administrators. Since NAEP assessments 
are administered uniformly using the 
same sets of test forms across the nation, 
NAEP results serve as a common metric 
for all states and select urban districts. 
The assessment stays essentially the 
same from year to year, with only 
carefully documented changes. This 
permits NAEP to provide a clear picture 
of student academic progress over time. 
The possible universe of student 
respondents for NAEP 2027 is estimated 
to be 12,000 students at grade 8 
attending the approximately 308 public 
and private schools in a variety of states 
and the District of Columbia and may 
include Bureau of Indian Education 
Schools. 
This request is to conduct NAEP in 
2027, specifically for the Grade 8 
Science Pilot. 
NAEP will administer the assessment 
using school devices and the internet. 
For schools that cannot meet the 
minimum specification for the use of 
school devices, NAEP will provide an 
alternate delivery model utilizing NAEP 
Chromebooks. NAEP has transitioned to 
primarily administer on school devices 
with a staged approach so that trends 
can be measured across time. NAEP 
conducted a School-based Equipment 
study in 2024 (OMB #1850–0803 v.347) 
as well as a Field Test in 2025 (OMB 
#1850–0803 v.353) to provide more 
information about student and school 
interactions with the eNAEP system on 
school devices, as compared to NAEP 
Chromebooks and Surface Pros, to 
inform the use of school devices at a 
larger scale in NAEP assessments 
beginning in 2026. Also, a 2026 bridge 
study will compare NAEP devices and 
school devices to evaluate whether 
scores from the two different assessment 
models are comparable. Note: in this 
study, some schools that qualify to be 
assessed on school devices will be 
assessed on NAEP devices, since the 
two different school types (i.e., those qualified to assess on school devices, 
and those not qualified to assess on 
school devices) may have different 
characteristics. This will allow the 
study to establish a common linking 
population. 
This Clearance package is the first 
submission for the 2027 assessment, 
with both 60-day and 30-day 
consecutive public comment period 
notices that will be published in the 
Federal Register. While some drafted 
materials are included in this 60-day 
package in Appendices D, E, and I, the 
majority of 2027 materials are not 
available for this submission. Several 
final communications and Assessment 
Management System screens will be 
available in the 30-day package, which 
will be posted to the Federal Register in 
March 2026. This Clearance Package 
will have one amendment, which is 
planned to be submitted in July 2026, 
and which will replace any remaining 
drafted materials with final versions for 
the 2027 NAEP assessments.

Agency Information Collection 
Request for Comments 
AGENCY: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. Department 
of Energy (DOE). 
ACTION: Notice and request for comments. 
SUMMARY: EIA invites public comment and other Federal agencies to comment 
on a proposed information collection. 
EIA plans to collect information from 
the public to fulfill its data security 
requirements when providing access to 
confidential microdata for the purpose 
of evidence building. EIA’s data security 
agreements and other paperwork along 
with the corresponding security 
protocols allow EIA to maintain careful 
controls on confidentiality and privacy, 
as required by law. The purpose of this 
notice is to allow for 60 days of public 
comment on the proposed data security 
information collection, prior to 
submission of the information collection 
request (ICR) to the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Foundations for Evidence-Based 
Policymaking Act of 2018 mandates that 
the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) establish a Standard Application 
Process (SAP) for requesting access to 
certain confidential data assets. While 
the adoption of the SAP is required for 
statistical agencies and units designated 
under the Confidential Information 
Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act 
(CIPSEA), it is recognized that other 
agencies and organizational units within 
the Executive branch may benefit from 
the adoption of the SAP to accept 
applications for access to confidential 
data assets. The SAP is a process 
through which agencies, the 
Congressional Budget Office, State, 
local, and Tribal governments, 
researchers, and other individuals, as 
appropriate, may apply to access 
confidential data assets held by a 
Federal statistical agency or unit for the 
purposes of developing evidence. With 
the Interagency Council on Statistical 
Policy (ICSP) as advisors, the entities 
upon whom this requirement is levied 
are working with the SAP Project 
Management Office (PMO) and with 
OMB to implement the SAP. The SAP 
Portal is a single web-based common 
application for the public to request 
access to confidential data assets from 
Federal statistical agencies and units. 
The National Center for Science and 
Engineering Statistics (NCSES), within 
the National Science Foundation (NSF), 
submitted a Federal Register Notice in 
September 2022 announcing plans to 
collect information through the SAP 
Portal (87 FR 53793). Once an 
application for confidential data is

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159097 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices approved through the SAP Portal, EIA 
will collect information to meet its data 
security requirements. This collection 
will occur outside of the SAP Portal. 
(1) OMB No.: 1905–New; (2) Information Collection Request Title: DATA SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCESSING 
CONFIDENTIAL DATA; 
(3) Type of Request: Intent to seek approval to collect information from the 
public to fulfill the EIA security 
requirements allowing individuals to 
access confidential data assets for the 
purposes of building evidence; 
(4) Purpose: Title III of the Foundations for Evidence-Based 
Policymaking Act of 2018 (hereafter 
referred to as the Evidence Act) 
mandates that OMB establish a Standard 
Application Process (SAP) for 
requesting access to certain confidential 
data assets. Specifically, the Evidence 
Act requires OMB to establish a 
common application process through 
which agencies, the Congressional 
Budget Office, State, local, and Tribal 
governments, researchers, and other 
individuals, as appropriate, may apply 
for access to confidential data assets 
collected, accessed, or acquired by a 
statistical agency or unit. This new 
process will be implemented while 
maintaining stringent controls to protect 
confidentiality and privacy, as required 
by law. 
Data collected, accessed, or acquired 
by statistical agencies and units is vital 
for developing evidence on conditions, 
characteristics, and behaviors of the 
public and on the operations and 
outcomes of public programs and 
policies. This evidence can benefit the 
stakeholders in the programs, the 
broader public, as well as policymakers 
and program managers at the local, 
State, Tribal, and National levels. The 
many benefits of access to data for 
evidence building notwithstanding, EIA 
is required by law to maintain careful 
controls that allow it to minimize 
disclosure risk while protecting 
confidentiality and privacy. The 
fulfillment of EIA’s data security 
requirements places a degree of burden 
on the public, which is outlined below. 
The SAP Portal is a web-based 
application for the public to request 
access to confidential data assets from 
Federal statistical agencies and units. 
The objective of the SAP Portal is to 
increase public access to confidential 
data for the purposes of evidence 
building and reduce the burden of 
applying for confidential data. Once an 
individual’s application in the SAP 
Portal has received a positive 
determination, the data-owning 
agency(ies) or unit(s) will begin the 
process of collecting information to 
fulfill their data security requirements. 
The paragraphs below outline the 
SAP Policy, the steps to complete an 
application through the SAP Portal, and 
the process for agencies to collect 
information fulfilling their data security 
requirements. 
The SAP Policy 
At the recommendation of the ICSP, 
the SAP Policy establishes the SAP to be 
implemented by statistical agencies and 
units and incorporates directives from 
the Evidence Act. The policy is 
intended to provide guidance as to the 
application and review processes using 
the SAP Portal, setting forth clear 
standards that enable statistical agencies 
and units to implement a common 
application form and a uniform review 
process. The SAP Policy was submitted 
to the public for comment in January 
2022 (87 FR 2459). 
The SAP Portal 
The SAP Portal is an application 
interface connecting applicants seeking 
data with a catalog of data assets owned 
by the Federal statistical agencies and 
units. The SAP Portal is not a new data 
repository or warehouse; confidential 
data assets will continue to be stored in 
secure data access facilities owned and 
hosted by the Federal statistical 
agencies and units. The Portal will 
provide a streamlined application 
process across agencies, reducing 
redundancies in the application process. 
This single SAP Portal will improve the 
process for applicants, tracking and 
communicating the application process 
throughout its lifecycle. This reduces 
redundancies and burden on applicants 
that request access to data from multiple 
agencies. The SAP Portal will automate 
key tasks to save resources and time and 
will bring agencies into compliance 
with the Evidence Act statutory 
requirements. 
Data Discovery 
Individuals begin the process of 
accessing confidential data by 
discovering confidential data assets 
through the SAP data catalog, 
maintained by Federal statistical 
agencies at www.researchdatagov.org. 
Potential applicants can search by 
agency, topic, or keyword to identify 
data of interest or relevance. Once they 
have identified data of interest, 
applicants can view metadata outlining 
the title, description or abstract, scope 
and coverage, and detailed methodology 
related to a specific data asset to 
determine its relevance to their 
research. While statistical agencies and 
units shall endeavor to include 
metadata in the SAP data catalog on all 
confidential data assets for which they 
accept applications, it may not be 
feasible to include metadata for some 
data assets (e.g., potential curated versions of administrative data). A 
statistical agency or unit may still 
accept an application through the SAP 
Portal even if the requested data asset is 
not listed in the SAP data catalog. 
SAP Application Process 
Individuals who have identified and 
wish to access confidential data assets 
may apply for access through the SAP 
Portal. Applicants must create an 
account and follow all steps to complete 
the application. Applicants begin by 
entering their personal, contact, and 
institutional information, as well as the 
personal, contact, and institutional 
information of all individuals on their 
research team. Applicants proceed to 
provide summary information about 
their proposed project, to include 
project title, duration, funding, timeline, 
and other details including the data 
asset(s) they are requesting and any 
proposed linkages to data not listed in 
the SAP data catalog, including non- 
Federal data sources. Applicants then 
proceed to enter detailed information 
regarding their proposed project, 
including a project abstract, research 
question(s), literature review, project 
scope, research methodology, project 
products, and anticipated output. 
Applicants must demonstrate a need for 
confidential data, outlining why their 
research question cannot be answered 
using publicly available information. 
Submission for Review 
Upon submission of their application, 
applicants will receive a notification 
that their application has been received 
and is under review by the data owning 
agency or agencies (in the event where 
data assets are requested from multiple 
agencies). At this point, applicants will 
also be notified that application 
approval does not alone grant access to 
confidential data, and that, if approved, 
applicants must comply with the data- 
owning agency’s security requirements 
outside of the SAP Portal, which may 
include a background check. 
In accordance with the Evidence Act 
and the direction of the ICSP, agencies 
will approve or reject an application 
within a prompt timeframe. In some 
cases, agencies may determine that 
additional clarity, information, or 
modification is needed and request the 
applicant to ‘‘revise and resubmit’’ their 
application. Data discovery, the SAP 
application process, and the submission 
for review are planned to take place 
within the web-based SAP Portal. As

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159098 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices noted above, the notice announcing 
plans to collect information through the 
SAP Portal has been published 
separately (87 FR 53793). 
Access to Confidential Data 
In the event of a positive 
determination, the applicant will be 
notified that their proposal has been 
accepted. The positive or final adverse 
determination concludes the SAP Portal 
process. In the instance of a positive 
determination, the data-owning agency 
(or agencies) will contact the applicant 
to provide instructions on the agency’s 
security requirements that must be 
completed to gain access to the 
confidential data. The completion and 
submission of the agency’s security 
requirements will take place outside of 
the SAP Portal. 
Collection of Information for Data 
Security Requirements 
In order for researchers to access 
confidential data onsite at EIA’s 
headquarters in Washington, DC, they 
must fulfill all requirements for 
becoming temporary agents of EIA. To 
fulfill these requirements, a Data Access 
Agreement (DAA) must be signed 
between EIA and the researcher’s 
employing institution, and the team 
members must complete EIA’s CIPSEA 
training and sign a Non-disclosure 
Agreement, affirming their U.S. 
citizenship and their commitment not to 
disclose confidential data to 
unauthorized parties. 
(5) Annual Estimated Number of Respondents: 20; (6) Annual Estimated Number of Total Responses: 20; 
(7) Annual Estimated Number of Burden Hours: 100; 
(8) Annual Estimated Reporting and Recordkeeping Burden: The amount of 
time to complete the DAA and training 
will vary based on the confidential data 
assets requested and the access 
modality. To obtain access to EIA 
confidential data assets, it is estimated 
that the average time to complete and 
submit EIA’s data security agreements is 
100 minutes (5 hours) per applicant. 
This estimate does not include the time 
needed to complete and submit an 
application within the SAP Portal. All 
efforts related to SAP Portal 
applications occur prior to and separate 
from EIA’s effort to collect information 
related to data security requirements. 
Comments are invited on whether or 
not: (a) The proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper 
performance of agency functions, 
including whether the information will 
have a practical utility; (b) EIA’s 
estimate of the burden of the proposed 
collection of information, including the 
validity of the methodology and 
assumptions used, is accurate; (c) EIA 
can improve the quality, utility, and 
clarity of the information it will collect; 
and (d) EIA can minimize the burden of 
the collection of information on 
respondents, such as automated 
collection techniques or other forms of 
information technology.

Title: FERC–552, Annual Report of Natural Gas Transactions; FERC–549E, 
Price Index Data Providers and 
Developers. 
OMB Control No.: 1902–0242, 1902– 
0328 
Type of Request: Three-year extension 
of the FERC–549E and FERC–552 
information collection requirements 
with no changes to the current reporting 
requirements. 
Abstract: 
FERC–552: The Commission uses the information collected in the FERC Form 
No. 552
1
to provide greater 
transparency into the size of the 
physical natural gas market and the use 
of physical fixed-price and index-based 
natural gas transactions. This 
information assists the Commission and 
the public in assessing whether index 
prices are the result of a robust market 
of fixed-price transactions. 
FERC Form No. 552 had its genesis in 
the Energy Policy Act of 2005,
2
which 
added section 23 of the Natural Gas Act 
(NGA). Section 23 of the NGA, among 
other things, directs the Commission ‘‘to 
facilitate price transparency in markets 
for the sale or transportation of physical 
natural gas in interstate commerce, 
having due regard for the public 
interest, the integrity of those markets, 
and the protection of consumers.’’
3
 
FERC–549E: Price indices are commonly used in natural gas and 
electricity wholesale markets. These 
indices are used by market participants 
to price their commodities. The 
Commission set forth standards for price 
index developers to demonstrate that 
their internal processes were sufficient 
to qualify as a Commission-approved 
price index developer and, thus, have 
their price indices referenced in 
Commission-jurisdictional tariffs in 
their Initial Policy Statement.
4
Price 
index developers seeking approval 
voluntarily provide written statements 
to the Commission to explain how they 
met these standards. The Commission 
uses the information collected from 
these price index developers to 
determine whether the Commission

Actions Regarding the Commission’s Policy on 
Price Index Formation and Transparency, and 
Indices Referenced in Natural Gas and Electric 
Tariffs (PL20–3–000) (Revised Policy Statement), 
April 21, 2022. 
6
The Commission defines burden as the total 
time, effort, or financial resources expended by 
persons to generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or 
provide information to or for a Federal agency. For 
further explanation of what is included in the 
information collection burden, reference 5 Code of 
Federal Regulations 1320.3. 
7
The estimates for cost per response are derived 
using the following formula: Average Burden Hours 
per Response $103 per Hour = Average Cost per 
Response. The hourly cost figure comes from 
FERC’s average annual cost of salary plus benefits 
in FY25 of $214,093. We believe this estimate is 
comparable to respondents salaries.

would approve the use of their indices 
in Commission-jurisdictional tariffs. 
After the Initial Policy Statement was 
issued, thirteen price index developers 
sought approval. The Commission 
issued a Revised Policy Statement on 
April 21, 2022, effective on December 
31, 2022.
5
Beginning six months after 
the effective date of this revision, 
interstate natural gas pipelines and 
public utilities proposing to use price 
indices in jurisdictional tariffs are no 
longer entitled to the rebuttable 
presumption that a price index 
developer’s price indices produce just 
and reasonable rates unless the price 
index developer has obtained approval 
or re-approval from the Commission 
within the last seven years. The FERC– 
549E represents the burden for price 
index developers to comply with 
Commission requirements pertaining to 
information collection and data 
publication and to seek approval of their 
index with the Commission and for data 
providers that submit information to 
price index developers. 
Type of Respondents: Wholesale 
natural gas market participants (FERC– 
552), price index data providers and 
developers (FERC–549E).

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY 
Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission 
[Docket No. CP25–497–000] 
Northwest Pipeline, LLC; Notice of 
Availability of the Environmental 
Assessment for the Proposed; Wild 
Trail Project 
The staff of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (FERC or 
Commission) has prepared an 
environmental assessment (EA) for the 
Wild Trail Project (Project), proposed by 
Northwest Pipeline, LLC (Northwest) in 
the above-referenced docket.
1
Northwest 
requests authorization to construct and 
operate the Daggett Compressor Station, 
adjacent to the existing Clay Basin 
Meter Station, in Daggett County, Utah. 
The Project would provide an additional 
57,955 dekatherms a day of northbound 
firm transportation service from the 
existing Wild Horse Receipt Point to the 
Kern River Muddy Creek Delivery Point. 
Any person wishing to comment on 
the EA may do so. To ensure 
consideration of your comments on the 
proposal prior to making a decision on 
the project, it is important that the 
Commission receive your comments on 
or before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 
January 14, 2026. Instructions for filing 
comments are provided on page 3. 
FERC is the lead federal agency for 
authorizing interstate natural gas 
transmission facilities under the Natural 
Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and the lead 
federal agency for preparation of the EA. 
The EA assesses the potential 
environmental effects of the Project in 
accordance with the requirements of the 
National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA)
2
and the Commission’s 
implementing regulations.
3
The 
principal purposes of the EA are to: 
identify and assess the potential effects 
on the natural and human environment; 
describe and evaluate reasonable 
alternatives; identify and recommend 
mitigation measures; and facilitate 
public involvement in the 
environmental review process. The EA 
concludes that approval of the proposed 
project would not constitute a major 
federal action significantly affecting the 
quality of the human environment. 
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management 
participated as a cooperating agency in 
the preparation of the EA. Cooperating 
agencies have jurisdiction by law or 
special expertise with respect to 
resources potentially affected by the 
proposal and participate in the NEPA 
analysis. The BLM will adopt and use 
the EA, along with other supporting 
documentation, to consider the issuance 
of a Mineral Leasing Act right-of-way 
grant for the Project, as the proposed 
compressor station site is on federal 
lands managed by the BLM. Although 
the BLM provided input to the 
conclusions and recommendations 
presented in the EA, the BLM will 
present its own conclusions and 
recommendations in its respective 
Record of Decision for the project. 
The EA addresses the potential 
environmental effects of the following 
project facilities: 
€construction and operation of the new Daggett Compressor Station, 
including one gas-fired turbine with 
11,110 nominal horsepower and 
ancillary facilities; 
€installation of 24-inch-diameter suction and discharge yard piping to 
interconnect the Daggett Compressor 
Station to Northwest’s existing 26-inch- 
diameter Northwest Pipeline; and 
€minor modifications to the existing Clay Basin Meter Station. 
The Commission mailed a copy of the 
Notice of Availability of the EA to 
federal, state, and local government 
representatives and agencies; elected 
officials; environmental and public 
interest groups; Native American tribes; 
potentially affected landowners and 
other interested individuals and groups; 
and newspapers and libraries in the 
project area. The EA is only available in 
electronic format. It may be viewed and 
downloaded from the FERC’s website 
(www.ferc.gov), on the natural gas 
environmental documents page (https:// 
www.ferc.gov/industries-data/natural- 
gas/environment/environmental- 
documents). In addition, the EA may be 
accessed by using the eLibrary link on 
the FERC’s website. Click on the 
eLibrary link (https://elibrary.ferc.gov/ 
eLibrary/search), select ‘‘General 
Search’’ and enter the docket number in 
the ‘‘Docket Number’’ field, excluding 
the last three digits (i.e. CP25–497). Be sure you have selected an appropriate

reasonable alternatives, and measures to 
avoid or lessen environmental effects. 
The more specific your comments, the 
more useful they will be. For your 
convenience, there are three methods 
you can use to file your comments to the 
Commission. The Commission 
encourages electronic filing of 
comments and has staff available to

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Title: Standards of Conduct for Transmission Providers and Marketing 
Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines 
OMB Control No.: 1902–0157 
Type of Request: Three-year extension 
of the FERC–592 information collection 
requirements with no changes to the 
current reporting requirements. 
Abstract: The Commission uses the information maintained and posted by 
the respondents to monitor the 
pipeline’s transportation, sales, and 
storage activities for its marketing 
affiliates to deter undue discrimination 
by pipeline companies in favor of their 
marketing affiliates. Non-affiliated 
shippers and other entities (e.g. state commissions) also use the information 
to determine whether they have been 
harmed by affiliate preference and to 
prepare submissions and formulate 
positions in rate cases and other 
proceedings. 
18 CFR Part 358 (Standards of Conduct) 
Respondents maintain and provide 
the information required by 18 CFR part 
358 on their public websites. This

‘‘Burden’’ is defined as the total time, effort, or 
financial resources expended by persons to 
generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or provide 
information to or for a Federal agency. For further 
explanation of what is included in the information 
collection burden, reference 5 CFR 1320.3. 
2
The cost is based on FERC’s 2025 Commission- 
wide average salary cost (salary plus benefits) of 
$103.00/hour. The Commission staff believes the 
FERC FTE (full-time equivalent) average cost for 
wages plus benefits is representative of the 
corresponding cost for the industry respondents. 
requirement ensures that non-affiliated 
shippers obtain comparable access to 
the non-public transportation 
information, which allows them to 
compete with marketing affiliates on a 
more equal basis. 
18 CFR 250.16, and the FERC–592 Log/ 
Format 
This form (log/format) provides the 
electronic formats for maintaining 
information on discounted 
transportation transactions and capacity 
allocation to support monitoring of 
activities of interstate pipeline 
marketing affiliates. 
Without this information collection: 
€the Commission would have difficulty effectively monitoring 
whether pipelines are giving 
discriminatory preference to their 
marketing affiliates; and 
€non-affiliated shippers, state commissions, and others would have 
difficulty determining whether they 
have been harmed by affiliate preference 
and preparing submissions for rate cases 
and other proceedings. 
Type of Respondents: Natural gas 
pipelines.

Commission estimates the annual

have practical utility; (2) the accuracy of 
the agency’s estimate of the burden and 
cost of the collection of information, 
including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used; (3) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and

Fall River Electric Cooperative, Inc.; 
Notice of Intent To Prepare an 
Environmental Assessment 
On August 31, 2021, Fall River 
Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Fall River) 
filed an application for a new major 
license for the existing 7.45-megawatt 
Felt Project (FERC No. 5089). The Felt 
Project is located on the Teton River in 
Teton County, Idaho. The project 
occupies federal lands administered by 
the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. 
In accordance with the Commission’s 
regulations, on October 1, 2025, 
Commission staff issued a notice that 
the project was ready for environmental 
analysis (REA Notice). Based on the 
information in the record, including 
comments filed on the REA Notice, staff 
does not anticipate that licensing the 
project would constitute a major federal 
action significantly affecting the quality 
of the human environment. Therefore, 
staff intends to prepare an 
Environmental Assessment (EA) on the 
application to license the Felt Project.

The EA will be issued and circulated 
for review by all interested parties. All 
comments filed on the EA will be 
analyzed by staff and considered in the 
Commission’s final licensing decision.

with making filings such as

[Docket No. CP26–17–000] 
Leaf River Energy Center LLC; Notice 
of Scoping Period Requesting 
Comments on Environmental Issues 
for the Proposed Leaf River Capacity 
Expansion Project 
The staff of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (FERC or 
Commission) will prepare an 
environmental document that will 
discuss the environmental impacts of 
the Leaf River Capacity Expansion 
Project (Project) involving construction 
and operation of facilities by Leaf River 
Energy Center LLC (LREC) in Smith, 
Jasper, and Clarke counties, Mississippi. 
The Commission will use this 
environmental document in its 
decision-making process to determine 
whether the project is in the public 
convenience and necessity. 
This notice announces the opening of 
the scoping process the Commission 
will use to gather input from the public 
and interested agencies regarding the 
project. As part of the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) 
review process, the Commission takes 
into account concerns the public may 
have about proposals and the 
environmental impacts that could result 
from its action whenever it considers 
the issuance of a Certificate of Public 
Convenience and Necessity. This 
gathering of public input is referred to 
as ‘‘scoping.’’ The main goal of the 
scoping process is to focus the analysis 
in the environmental document on the 
important environmental issues. 
Additional information about the 
Commission’s NEPA process is 
described below in the NEPA Process 
and Environmental Document section of 
this notice. 
By this notice, the Commission 
requests public comments on the scope 
of issues to address in the 
environmental document. To ensure 
that your comments are timely and 
properly recorded, please submit your 
comments so that the Commission 
receives them in Washington, DC on or 
before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 
January 12, 2026. Comments may be 
submitted in written form. Further 
details on how to submit comments are 
provided in the Public Participation 
section of this notice. 
Your comments should focus on the 
potential environmental effects, 
reasonable alternatives, and measures to 
avoid or lessen environmental impacts. 
Your input will help the Commission 
staff determine what issues they need to 
evaluate in the environmental 
document. Commission staff will 
consider all written comments during 
the preparation of the environmental 
document. 
If you submitted comments on this 
project to the Commission before the 
opening of this docket on October 31, 
2025, you will need to file those 
comments in Docket No. CP26–17–000 
to ensure they are considered as part of 
this proceeding. 
This notice is being sent to the 
Commission’s current environmental 
mailing list for this project. State and 
local government representatives should 
notify their constituents of this 
proposed project and encourage them to 
comment on their areas of concern. 
If you are a landowner receiving this 
notice, a pipeline company 
representative may contact you about 
the acquisition of an easement to 
construct, operate, and maintain the 
proposed facilities. The company would 
seek to negotiate a mutually acceptable 
easement agreement. You are not 
required to enter into an agreement.

However, if the Commission approves 
the project, the Natural Gas Act conveys 
the right of eminent domain to the 
company. Therefore, if you and the 
company do not reach an easement 
agreement, the pipeline company could 
initiate condemnation proceedings in 
court. In such instances, compensation 
would be determined by a judge in 
accordance with state law. The 
Commission does not subsequently 
grant, exercise, or oversee the exercise 
of that eminent domain authority. The 
courts have exclusive authority to 
handle eminent domain cases; the 
Commission has no jurisdiction over 
these matters. 
LREC provided landowners with a 
fact sheet prepared by the FERC entitled 
‘‘An Interstate Natural Gas Facility On 
My Land? What Do I Need To Know?’’ 
which addresses typically asked 
questions, including the use of eminent 
domain and how to participate in the 
Commission’s proceedings. This fact 
sheet along with other landowner topics 
of interest are available for viewing on 
the FERC website (www.ferc.gov) under 
the Natural Gas, Landowner Topics link.

Summary of the Proposed Project 
LREC proposes to expand existing 
natural gas storage caverns and create a 
new natural gas storage cavern. The Leaf 
River Capacity Expansion Project would 
allow LREC to increase the certificated 
natural gas storage capacity at its 
existing New Home Salt Dome storage 
facility by 17.62 billion cubic feet 
(‘‘Bcf’’). According to LREC, the project 
would help satisfy market demand for 
incremental natural gas storage and is 
needed to provide critical natural gas 
grid reliability, and to help reduce price 
volatility and physical supply and 
demand imbalances in the Gulf Coast 
natural gas market. 
The Leaf River Capacity Expansion 
Project would consist of the following 
facilities: 
€one new salt dome cavern with 12.52 billion cubic feet of working gas 
capacity, a well pad site, wellhead 
equipment, and other pipeline 
appurtenances; 
€a new service corridor that includes 16-inch- and 24-inch-diameter gas 
headers, 16-inch-diameter raw water 
and brine lines, and appurtenant 
facilities connecting to the new cavern 
well; 
€two new gas-powered centrifugal compressors with a total of 27,010 
horsepower (hp) at an existing 
compression facility; and 
€installation of a 6,130 hp gas- powered centrifugal compressor within 
the existing fence line of a booster 
station. 
The general location of the project 
facilities is shown in appendix 1.
1
 
Land Requirements for Construction 
Constructing the proposed facilities 
would disturb about 32.0 acres of land. 
Following construction, LREC would 
maintain about 18.0 acres of land for 
permanent operation of the proposed 
facilities, and the remaining acreage 
would be restored and be allowed to 
revert to former uses. 
NEPA Process and the Environmental 
Document 
Any environmental document issued 
by the Commission will discuss impacts 
that could occur as a result of the 
construction and operation of the 
proposed project under the relevant 
general resource areas: 
€geology and soils; €water resources and wetlands; €vegetation and wildlife; €threatened and endangered species; €cultural resources; €land use; €air quality and noise; and €reliability and safety. Commission staff will also evaluate 
reasonable alternatives to the proposed 
project or portions of the project and 
make recommendations on how to 
lessen or avoid impacts on the various 
resource areas. Your comments will 
help Commission staff identify and 
focus on the issues that might have an 
effect on the human environment and 
potentially eliminate others from further 
study and discussion in the 
environmental document. 
Following this scoping period, 
Commission staff will determine 
whether to prepare an Environmental 
Assessment (EA) or an Environmental 
Impact Statement (EIS). The EA or the 
EIS will present Commission staff’s 
independent analysis of the issues. If 
Commission staff prepares an EA, a 
Notice of Schedule for the Preparation 
of an Environmental Assessment will be 
issued. The EA may be issued for an 
allotted public comment period. The 
Commission would consider timely 
comments on the EA before making its 
decision regarding the proposed project. 
If Commission staff prepares an EIS, a 
Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS/ 
Notice of Schedule will be issued, 
which will open up an additional 
comment period. Staff will then prepare

Authority (GRDA) filed an application 
for a new license to continue to operate 
and maintain the 105.176-megawatt 
Pensacola Hydroelectric Project No. 
1494 (Pensacola Project). On September 
23, 2025, Commission staff issued a 
study plan determination (SPD) for an 
outstanding request for a study plan 
modification related to a contaminated 
sediment transport study. The SPD 
included an Integrated Licensing 
Process Plan and Schedule (Process 
Plan and Schedule), which among other 
things, required the filing of a final 
report for the contaminated sediment 
transport desktop study by April 21, 
2026. 
On October 23, 2025, GRDA requested 
an 180-day extension of time to file the 
final study report. GRDA requested the 
additional time to: (1) identify and 
consult with experts from federal and 
state agencies, Tribes, local 
governments, and interested non- 
governmental agencies; (2) allow time 
for GRDA and the stakeholders to 
refamiliarize themselves with the 
administrative record, as well as for 
GRDA to retain a consultant to conduct 
the study; and (3) prepare the study 
report. 
GRDA’s request is reasonable, and, 
therefore, is granted. The revised 
Process Plan and Schedule, which 
reflects the 180-day extension of time to

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Title: FERC–539 (Gas Pipeline Certificates: Import & Export Related 
Applications). 
OMB Control No.: 1902–0062. 
Type of Request: Three-year extension 
of the FERC–539 with no changes to the 
current reporting requirements. 
Abstract: The purpose of FERC–539 is to implement information collections 
pursuant to Section 3 of the Natural Gas 
Act (NGA).
1
This statute provides, in 
part, that ‘‘. . . no person shall export 
any natural gas from the United States 
to a foreign country or import any 
natural gas from a foreign country 
without first having secured an order 
from the Commission authorizing it to 
do so.’’
2
This statute applies not only to 
natural gas imported and/or exported 
via pipeline, but also to any import and/ 
or export of liquefied natural gas via a 
liquefied natural gas terminal. The 1992 
amendments to Section 3 of the NGA 
concern importation or exportation 
from/to a nation which has a free trade 
agreement with the United States, and 
requires that such importation or 
exportation: (1) Shall be deemed to be 
a ‘‘first sale’’, i.e., not a sale for a resale, and (2) Shall be deemed to be consistent 
with the public interest, and 
applications for such importation or 
exportation shall be granted without 
modification or delay.

(NESHAP) for Secondary Aluminum 
Production (40 CFR part 63, subpart 
RRR) were promulgated on March 23, 
2000; and amended on the following 
dates: December 30, 2002 (67 FR 79808);

September 18, 2015 (80 FR 56700); and 
June 13, 2016 (81 FR 38085). These 
regulations apply to existing facilities 
and new facilities that are secondary 
aluminum production facilities and 
major sources of hazardous air 
pollutants (HAP) either commencing 
construction, or reconstruction, after the 
date of proposal. This includes facilities 
that operate aluminum scrap shredders, 
thermal chip dryers, scrap dryers/ 
delacquering kilns/decoating kilns, 
group 1 furnaces, group 2 furnaces, 
sweat furnaces, dross only furnaces, 
rotary dross coolers, and secondary 
aluminum processing units (SAPUs). 
The SAPUs include group 1 furnaces 
and in-line fluxers. The regulations also 
apply to secondary aluminum 
production facilities that are area 
sources of HAP only with respect to 
emissions of dioxins/furans (D/F) from 
thermal chip dryers, scrap dryers/ 
delacquering kilns/decoating kilns, 
group 1 furnaces, sweat furnaces, and 
SAPUs. New facilities include those that 
commenced either construction, or 
reconstruction after the date of proposal. 
This information is being collected to 
assure compliance with 40 CFR part 63, 
subpart RRR. 
Form Numbers: None. 
Respondents/affected entities: 
Secondary aluminum production 
facilities. 
Respondent’s obligation to respond: 
Mandatory (40 CFR part 63, subpart 
RRR). 
Estimated number of respondents: 
164 (total). 
Frequency of response: Initially and 
semiannually. 
Total estimated burden: 13,000 hours 
(per year). Burden is defined at 5 CFR 
1320.03(b). 
Total estimated cost: $5,160,000 (per 
year), which includes $4,650,000 
annualized capital or operation & 
maintenance costs. 
Changes in the Estimates: The 
increase in burden from the most 
recently approved ICR is due to an 
adjustment. The adjustment is due to an 
increase in the number of new sources 
expected over the next three years based 
on feedback received during 
consultation. There is an increase in the 
capital/O&M costs due to the increased 
number of new sources described above.

Needs and Uses: On April 20, 2017, 
the Commission adopted a Report and 
Order in MB Docket No. 12–106, FCC 
17–41, In the Matter of Noncommercial 
Educational Station Fundraising for 
Third-Party Non-Profit Organizations, 
which relaxed the rules to allow NCE 
stations to spend up to one percent of 
their total annual airtime conducting 
on-air fundraising activities that 
interrupt regular programming for the 
benefit of third-party non-profit 
organizations. The Report and Order 
imposed the following information 
collection requirements on NCE 
stations: 
Audience disclosure: The information 
collection requirements contained in 47 
CFR 73.503(e)(1) require that a 
noncommercial educational FM 
broadcast station that interrupts regular 
programming to conduct fundraising 
activities on behalf of third-party non- 
profit organizations must air a 
disclosure during such activities clearly 
stating that the fundraiser is not for the 
benefit of the station itself and 
identifying the entity for which it is 
fundraising. The information collection 
requirements contained in 47 CFR 
73.621(f)(1) require that a 
noncommercial educational TV 
broadcast station that interrupts regular 
programming to conduct fundraising 
activities on behalf of third-party non- 
profit organizations must air a 
disclosure during such activities clearly 
stating that the fundraiser is not for the 
benefit of the station itself and 
identifying the entity for which it is 
fundraising. The audience disclosure 
must be aired at the beginning and the 
end of each fundraising program and at 
least once during each hour in which 
the program is on the air. 
Retention of information on 
fundraising activities in local public 
inspection file: The information 
collection requirements contained in 47 
CFR 73.3527(e)(14) require that each 
noncommercial educational FM 
broadcast station and noncommercial 
educational TV broadcast station that 
interrupts regular programming to 
conduct fundraising activities on behalf 
of a third-party non-profit organization 
must place in its local public inspection 
file, on a quarterly basis, the following 
information for each third-party 
fundraising program or activity: The 
date, time, and duration of the 
fundraiser; the type of fundraising 
activity; the name of the non-profit 
organization benefitted by the 
fundraiser; a brief description of the 
specific cause or project, if any, 
supported by the fundraiser; and, to the 
extent that the station participated in 
tallying or receiving any funds for the 
non-profit group, an approximation, to 
the nearest $10,000, of the total funds 
raised. The information for each 
calendar quarter is to be filed by the 
tenth day of the succeeding calendar 
quarter (e.g., January 10 for the quarter October–December, April 10 for the 
quarter January–March, etc.).

Communications Commission (FCC or 
the Commission) invites the general 
public and other Federal agencies to 
take this opportunity to comment on the 
following information collection.

quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information collected; ways to minimize 
the burden of the collection of 
information on the respondents, 
including the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of 
information technology; and ways to 
further reduce the information 
collection burden on small business 
concerns with fewer than 25 employees. 
The FCC may not conduct or sponsor 
a collection of information unless it 
displays a currently valid control 
number. No person shall be subject to 
any penalty for failing to comply with

functionality by November 30, 2019 to 
allow WEA alert originators (e.g., local emergency management offices) to target 
a WEA alert to eligible devices in a 
prescribed geographic area (e.g., an area where there is imminent threat of the 
loss of life or property). See Federal 
Communications Commission, Wireless 
Emergency Alerts; Emergency Alert 
System, 83 FR 8619, 8623 (Feb. 28, 
2018) (announcing a Nov. 30, 2019 
amendment to 47 CFR 10.450). 
The Commission seeks to evaluate 
WEA performance, particularly with 
respect to the accuracy of providers’ 
geo-targeting capabilities. To do so, the 
Commission will use surveys to collect 
information and evaluate performance 
during a WEA test. Survey respondents 
affiliated with alert originators, 
partnered with the Commission in 
different geographic areas of the 
country, will be asked to complete a 
survey. The survey will be accessible by 
a hyperlink embedded in a WEA test 
alert and by a URL provided by the 
Commission. The Commission has 
developed a survey, which is available 
at https://www.fcc.gov/wea. The Commission also made available a 
Spanish-language version of the test 
message at, https://www.fcc.gov/wea-es. 
The information sought in this 
collection is necessary and vital to 
ensuring that WEA is effective at 
protecting the life and property of the 
public.

A. OMB Control Number, Title, and 
Any Associated Form(s) 
9000–0034, Examination of Records 
by Comptroller General and Contract 
Audit. 
B. Need and Uses 
This clearance covers the information 
that contractors must submit to comply 
with the following Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) requirements, as 
codified in Chapter 1 of Title 48 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations: 
FAR 52.212–5, Contract Terms and 
Conditions Required to Implement 
Statutes or Executive Orders— 
Commercial Products and Commercial 
Services. Paragraph (d) of this clause 
requires contractors to make available at 
its offices at all reasonable times the 
records, materials, and other evidence 
for examination, audit, or reproduction 
by the Comptroller General of the 
United States, or an authorized 
representative. As used in this clause, 
records include books, documents, 
accounting procedures and practices, 
and other data, regardless of type and 
regardless of form. 
FAR 52.214–26, Audit and Records— 
Sealed Bidding. This clause requires 
contractors required to submit certified 
cost or pricing data in connection with 
the pricing of a modification under a 
contract and to make all records 
available to the contracting officer, or its 
authorized representative, including 
computations and projections related to 
the proposal for the modification; the 
discussions conducted on the 
proposal(s), including those related to 
negotiating; pricing of the modification; 
or performance of the modification. This 
clause requires contractors to make all 
records available to the Comptroller 
General of the United States, or an 
authorized representative, in the case of 
pricing a modification. This clause 
allows the Comptroller General to 
interview any current employee 
regarding such transactions. 
FAR 52.215–2, Audit and Records— 
Negotiation. This clause requires 
contractors to maintain records for cost- 
reimbursement, incentive, time-and- 
materials, labor-hour, or price 
redeterminable contracts, or any 
combination of these, for contracting 
officers, or an authorized representative, 
to examine and audit all records and 
other evidence sufficient to reflect 
properly all costs claimed to have been 
incurred or anticipated to be incurred 
directly or indirectly in performance of 
a contract. The right of examination 
includes inspection at all reasonable 
times of contractor’s plants, or parts of 
them, engaged in performing the 
pertinent contract. Contractors required 
to submit certified cost or pricing data 
in connection with a pricing action 
under a contract must make all records 
available to the contracting officer, or its 
authorized representative, including 
computations and projections related to 
the proposal for the contract, 
subcontract, or modification; the 
discussions conducted on the 
proposal(s), including those related to 
negotiating; pricing of the contract, 
subcontract, or modification; or 
performance of the contract, subcontract 
or modification. Also, this clause 
requires contractors to make all records 
available to the Comptroller General of 
the United States, or an authorized 
representative, to examine any of the 
contractor’s directly pertinent records 
involving transactions under the 
pertinent contract or subcontract. This 
clause allows the Comptroller General 
to interview any current employee 
regarding such transactions. 
The information must be retained so 
that audits necessary for contract 
surveillance, verification of contract 
pricing, and reimbursement of 
contractor costs can be performed. This 
information collection does not require 
contractors to create or maintain any 
record that the contractor does not 
maintain in its ordinary course of 
business.

Extension of a currently approved 
collection. 
Type of Review Request: Regular. 
Respondents: Current executive branch employees (and/or their 
representatives) seeking to accept 
payments for legal expenses from a legal 
expense fund or the provision of pro 
bono legal services for matters arising in 
connection with the employee’s past or 
current official position, the employee’s 
prior position on a campaign of a 
candidate for President or Vice 
President, or the employee’s prior 
position on a Presidential Transition 
Team; legal expense fund trustees. 
Estimated Average Annual Number of 
Responses: 133. Total Estimated Time per Response: 5 
minutes to 20 hours (see table below for 
detailed explanation). 
Estimated Average Total Annual 
Burden: 109.2 hours. OMB Control Number: 3209–0012. 
Abstract: On May 25, 2023, OGE published a final rule establishing a 
framework to govern an executive 
branch employee’s acceptance of 
payments for legal expenses through a 
Legal Expense Fund (LEF) for matters 
arising in connection with the 
employee’s official position, the 
employee’s prior position on a 
campaign of a candidate for President or 
Vice President, or the employee’s prior 
position on a Presidential Transition 
Team. The requirements for establishing 
and maintaining an LEF are found in 5 
CFR part 2635, subpart J (LEF 
regulation). 
The LEF regulation requires that 
employees who wish to establish a legal 
expense fund do so through a trust with 
a single, named employee beneficiary 
and a trustee. It also requires an 
employee beneficiary to file quarterly 
reports that include information (1) 
regarding members of the public who 
make financial donations to help pay for 
the employee beneficiary’s legal 
expenses (donors) and (2) members of 
the public who receive payments from 
a legal expense fund (payees). The 
employee beneficiary must also file a 
termination report upon the termination 
of the trust and/or executive branch 
employment. The trust documents, 
quarterly reports, and termination 
reports will be posted directly on OGE’s 
website in accordance with 5 CFR 
2635.1007(g). Together, this information 
collection (IC) is titled ‘‘OGE Legal 
Expense Fund Information Collection.’’ 
The IC was approved by OMB and 
assigned OMB Control Number 3209– 
0012 on July 21, 2023. 
The following table estimates the total 
annual burden resulting from the OGE 
Legal Expense Fund Information 
Collection. 
Instrument Time per response Number of 
annual 
responses 
Total burden 
(hours) 
Trust Document ......................................................................................... 20 hours .......................................... 3 60 Quarterly and Termination Reports (beneficiary burden) .......................... 2 hours ............................................ 20 40 Quarterly and Termination Reports (donor and payee burden) ................ 5 minutes .........................................110 9.2 Total .................................................................................................... .......................................................... ........................109.2 OGE estimates that there will be 
approximately three new legal expense 
funds filed each year. It is anticipated 
that there may be an average of five legal 
expense fund trusts in existence each 
year. Each trust is anticipated to have 
approximately 20 donors, whose 
reporting requirements are tied to the 
frequency with which they donate, and 
approximately two payees, who will 
submit information each time they 
receive a distribution. The burden for 
collecting this information from donors 
and payees is on the trustees. These 
estimates are based in part on OGE’s 
knowledge of several legal expense 
funds that have been established for 
Executive branch employees, as well as 
OGE’s consultation with the U.S. House 
of Representatives and the U.S. Senate 
regarding the legal expense funds that 
they oversee. 
Based on the above, OGE estimates an 
average annual time burden during the 
next three years of 109.2 hours. Using 
an estimated rate of $340 per hour for 
the services of a professional trustee or 
private representative, the estimated 
annual cost burden is $37,128. 
Under OMB’s implementing 
regulations for the Paperwork Reduction 
Act, any recordkeeping, reporting, or 
disclosure requirement contained in a 
rule of general applicability is deemed 
to involve ten or more persons. See 5 
CFR 1320.3(c)(4)(i). 
OGE plans to submit the instruments 
described above to OMB for a three-year 
extension of approval without 
modification, pursuant to the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 
chapter 35. 
Request for Comments: Agency and 
public comments are invited 
specifically on the need for and 
practical utility of this information 
collection, on the accuracy of OGE’s 
burden estimate, on the enhancement of 
quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information collected, and on 
minimizing the burden to the public. 
Comments received in response to this 
notice will be summarized for, and may 
be included with, the OGE request for 
extension of OMB approval. The 
comments will also become a matter of 
public record. 
Specifically, OGE seeks public 
comment on the following: 
1. What problems do you have using the 
form? 
2. Are there sections of the form or 
instructions that are unclear? 
3. Is there information provided that is 
confusing? 
4. What additional information would be 
helpful? 
5. Is it clear from the form that the filing 
requirement begins once a Legal Expense 
Fund is approved under Subpart J of 5 CFR 
part 2635, regardless of whether a reportable 
contribution or distribution is made during a 
reporting period? 
Authority: 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A); 5 CFR 1320.8(d)(1); 5 CFR part 2635, 
subpart J. 
Approved: December 15, 2025.

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159125 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices proposal has merit and that SDU is in 
a unique position to conduct this work, 
as it has extensive experience 
conducting vaccine trials in West 
Africa, established partnerships with 
local hospitals and health authorities in 
Guinea-Bissau, and a proven track 
record in neonatal and pediatric 
research in low-resource settings. 
The award is being made non- 
competitively because there is no 
current, pending, or planned funding 
opportunity announcement under 
which this proposal could compete. 
Summary of the Award 
Recipient: University of Southern Denmark (SDU). 
Purpose of the Award: The purpose of 
this award is to evaluate the effects of 
neonatal monovalent Hepatitis B 
vaccination (HBV0) on early-life 
mortality and morbidity, as well as long- 
term neurodevelopmental outcomes, 
through a randomized controlled trial in 
Guinea-Bissau. The findings will inform 
global immunization policy and 
practice, particularly regarding the 
broader health effects of HBV0, which 
remain less well understood compared 
to BCG and OPV0. 
Amount of Award: $1,600,000 in 
Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 2026 funds, 
with the total estimated $1,600,000 
provided for the full five-year period of 
performance, subject to availability of 
funds. 
Authority: This program is authorized under the Public Health Service Act, 
Sections 301(a) [42 U.S.C. 241], 307 (42 
U.S.C. 242l], and 317(k)(2) [42 U.S.C. 
247b], as amended. 
Period of Performance: January 5, 
2026, through January 4, 2031.

grantees. PREIS grant recipients are 
required to carry out local evaluations of 
their programs and submit a final 
evaluation report to ACF documenting 
their analyses and findings. This request 
includes guidance for grant recipients in 
the form of templates. Information will 
inform technical assistance (TA) to 
support grantees in developing and 
submitting the final reports to ACF to 
fulfill a grant requirement. We do not 
intend for this information to be used as 
the principal basis for public policy 
decisions. 
DATES: Comments due January 20, 2026. ADDRESSES: The public may view and comment on this information collection 
request at: https://www.reginfo.gov/ 
public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_
nbr=202512-0970-005. You can also obtain copies of the proposed collection 
of information by emailing 
opreinfocollection@acf.hhs.gov. Identify all requests by the title of the 
information collection. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Description: The purpose of the current information collection request is 
to provide a standardized template and 
accompanying instructions to the 12 
PREIS grant recipients carrying out 
impact evaluations. This template will 
help them document their evaluation’s 
research questions, measures, study 
design, planned and actual 
implementation of the program, analytic 
methods, and findings. A structured 
final evaluation report template will 
facilitate grant recipients’ efficient and 
effective reporting of evaluation 
findings. The completed reports will be 
reviewed by the PREP Local Evaluation 
Support (LES) team to determine 
whether they meet ACF’s standards of 
rigor. The LES team will then develop 
recommendations for improvement and 
provide TA to support report 
development prior to final submission 
to ACF. While grantees are developing 
the reports, the PREP LES team will 
continue to provide support primarily 
by continuing to offer one-on-one TA 
calls with grant recipients. 
The template will be used by grant 
recipients upon Office of Management 
and Budget approval until September 
2026 (or until the end of their grant, if 
a no-cost extension is granted), which 
will allow them to submit draft versions 
of their final evaluation reports before 
revising and finalizing their reports by 
the end of their grant. Grant recipients 
will complete the PREIS Final 
Evaluation Report Template using the 
instructions which are included within 
each template section. 
The information collected is meant to 
contribute to the body of knowledge on 
ACF programs. It is not intended to be 
used as the principal basis for a decision 
by a federal decision-maker and is not 
expected to meet the threshold of 
influential or highly influential 
scientific information.

infocollection@acf.hhs.gov. Identify all requests by the title of the information 
collection. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Description: ORR proposes to continue to use the PDP Form and PPR, 
with revisions, to collect data on the 
Services for SOT grant recipients and 
their clients. The Recipients will 
continue to report their PDP through the 
ORR Refugee Arrivals Data System 
(RADS), an information technology 
platform used for enhanced data 
collection and record keeping. 
Grant recipients will provide 
aggregated data on new and continuing 
clients annually, including demographic 
information, characteristics related to 
experiences of torture, services received, 
length of service, and wellbeing across 
six outcome domains. 
Grant recipients will also provide 
information about community 
attendance at trainings and pro-bono 
services donated to the program. In the 
PPR, grant recipients will provide 
program narrative and program metric 
information on grant-funded activities 
and progress towards grant goals semi- 
annually. 
Information collected will be used in 
aggregate by ORR to provide reports to 
stakeholders, including a required 
Report to Congress, and responses to 
funding requests. 
ORR has made changes to the data 
collection, which include removing a 
total of twelve subcategories for two 
program indicators and reducing the 
frequency of reporting percentage-based 
outcomes in the program metrics. ORR 
has also added one subcategory in one 
program indicator. Overall, these 
changes have reduced the estimated 
reporting burden by 30 percent. 
Respondents: Services for SOT grant programs (this may include non-profit 
social service, health, and higher 
education organizations, states, 
municipalities, and for-profit 
organizations). 
Annual Burden Estimates 
Estimated annual burden has been 
updated to reflect a reduction in 
estimated time per response from an

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
FDA is issuing this guidance to clarify 
how FDA evaluates RWD to determine 
whether they are of sufficient quality for 
generating RWE that can be used in FDA 
regulatory decision-making for medical 
devices. This guidance provides 
expanded and updated 
recommendations to the 2017 guidance, 
‘‘Use of Real-World Evidence to Support 
Regulatory Decision-Making for Medical 
Devices’’ (the 2017 RWE Guidance) and 
supersedes the 2017 RWE Guidance. On 
December 29, 2022, the Food and Drug 
Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA) 
was signed into law as part of the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, 
Public Law 117–328. Section 3629 of 
FDORA ‘‘Facilitating the Use of Real 
World Evidence’’ directs FDA to issue 
or revise existing guidance on 
considerations for the use of RWD and 
RWE to support regulatory decision- 
making. FDA issued the draft guidance 
on December 19, 2023, to propose 
revisions to the 2017 RWE Guidance to 
satisfy the requirement under section 
3629(a)(2), and is finalizing this 
guidance to fulfill a commitment in 
section V.F. of the Medical Device User 
Fee Amendments Performance Goals 
and Procedures, Fiscal Years 2023 
Through 2027 (MDUFA V). 
This guidance includes FDA’s 
recommendations and considerations on 
the factors that sponsors should assess 
to demonstrate whether the RWD are 
relevant and reliable for a particular 
regulatory decision relating to medical 
devices. These recommendations and 
considerations apply regardless of the 
RWD source and encompass processes 
for conducting studies to generate RWE. 
FDA recognizes that there may be other 
approaches to address the 
considerations identified in this 
guidance. We encourage sponsors to 
discuss their approach with FDA, 
especially if the approach diverges from 
the recommendations in this guidance. 
The topics covered within this 
guidance are framed specifically for the 
use of RWD/RWE in regulatory 
submissions. This guidance includes 
additional clarity regarding the 
recommended methodologies for 
collection and analysis of RWD to 
generate RWE, and provides updated 
examples on previously used and 
accepted methodologies. This guidance 
also provides additional clarity 
regarding the use of clinical data 
collected from the use of a device 
authorized under an Emergency Use 
Authorization (EUA) and describes the 
type of information that could be 
applicable to support a determination 
under the Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments (CLIA) (e.g., 
Waiver by Application). 
FDA recognizes and anticipates that 
the Agency and industry may need up 
to 60 days to perform activities to 
operationalize the recommendations 
within this final guidance. For 
regulatory submissions that will be 
currently pending with FDA after 
publication of this final guidance, as 
well as those submissions received 
within 60 days following publication of 
this final guidance, FDA generally does 
not anticipate that sponsors will be 
ready to include the newly 
recommended information outlined in 
this final guidance in their submission. 
FDA, however, intends to review any 
such information if submitted at any 
time. 
A notice of availability of the draft 
guidance appeared in the Federal 
Register of December 19, 2023 (88 FR 87782). FDA considered comments 
received and revised the guidance as 
appropriate in response to the 
comments, including clarifying the 
recommendations in the guidance. This 
included clarifications on the relevance 
and reliability assessment, updating 
examples of how RWE is used in 
regulatory decision-making for medical 
devices, and how the relevance and 
reliability assessment fits into existing 
benefit/risk frameworks. 
This guidance is being issued 
consistent with FDA’s good guidance 
practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115). 
The guidance represents the current 
thinking of FDA on ‘‘Use of Real-World 
Evidence to Support Regulatory 
Decision-Making for Medical Devices.’’ 
It does not establish any rights for any 
person and is not binding on FDA or the 
public. You can use an alternative 
approach if it satisfies the requirements 
of the applicable statutes and 
regulations. FDA considered the 
applicability of Executive Order 14192, 
per OMB guidance in M–25–20, and 
finds this action to be deregulatory in 
nature.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
FDA is announcing the availability of 
a draft guidance document entitled 
‘‘Questions and Answers Regarding 
Mandatory Cosmetics Recalls: Guidance 
for Industry.’’ The purpose of this draft 
guidance document, when finalized, is 
to provide guidance to industry on the 
implementation of the mandatory 
cosmetics recall provisions of section 
611 of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act or the Act), 
which was added by section 3502 of the 
Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation 
Act of 2022 (MoCRA). The guidance is 
in the form of Questions and Answers 
and provides answers to common 
questions that might arise about these 
mandatory recall provisions and FDA’s 
current thinking regarding their 
implementation. 
This draft guidance is being issued 
consistent with FDA’s good guidance 
practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115). 
The draft guidance, when finalized, will 
represent the current thinking of FDA 
on mandatory cosmetics recalls. It does 
not establish any rights for any person 
and is not binding on FDA or the public. 
You can use an alternative approach if 
it satisfies the requirements of the 
applicable statutes and regulations. 
As we develop final guidance on this 
topic, FDA will consider comments on 
costs or cost savings the guidance may 
generate, relevant for Executive Order 
14192. 
II. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
FDA tentatively concludes that this 
draft guidance contains no collection of 
information. Therefore, clearance by the 
Office of Management and Budget under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 is 
not required. 
III. Electronic Access 
Persons with access to the internet 
may obtain the draft guidance at https:// 
www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/ 
search-fda-guidance-documents or https://www.regulations.gov.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
NIH serves as the steward of a wide 
range of research data and continuously 
works to optimize open sharing with 
appropriate protections throughout the 
entire data lifecycle. Given its numerous 
established data policies, NIH is 
proposing a holistic update to its data 
policy framework to strengthen data 
protections, clarify requirements, and 
reduce duplicative burden. 
First, NIH is proposing a new NIH 
Controlled-Access Data Policy to 
support the research community in 
fulfilling NIH data sharing expectations. 
This proposed policy specifies human 
participant data types required to be 
managed via controlled-access and 
provides criteria for assessing the need 
for controls for other data types. It also 
provides a standard set of expectations 
across NIH Institutes, Centers and

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159132 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices Offices to promote maximal responsible 
human participant data sharing through 
controlled access while simultaneously 
responding to emergent privacy and 
security risks, including those outlined 
in the following security directives: 
1. Executive Order 14117 and the 
Department of Justice’s final rule 
‘‘Preventing Access to Americans’ Bulk 
Sensitive Personal Data and United 
States Government-Related Data by 
Countries of Concern or Covered 
Persons’’ 28 CFR part 202 (see: https:// 
www.federalregister.gov/documents/ 
2025/01/08/2024-31486/preventing- 
access-to-us-sensitive-personal-data- 
and-government-related-data-by- 
countries-of-concern) identifying 
specific data types, along with 
associated thresholds, that should be 
protected to mitigate national security 
risks. 
2. The Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, 2023, requiring updates to genomic 
data sharing policies and practices to 
account for national security risks, 
Public Law No: 117–328. (see: https://
www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/ 
house-bill/2617/text). 
3. The Government Accountability 
Office report on Human Genomic Data, 
recommending NIH develop and 
implement procedures to proactively 
and comprehensively monitor 
researcher compliance with data 
management and security measures for 
human genomic data, GAO–25–107377 
(see: https://www.gao.gov/products/gao- 25-107377). 
Second, NIH is proposing to revise the 
NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy 
to reduce duplicative policy 
requirements and improve overall 
performance. The GDS Policy, issued in 
2014, promotes broad, responsible, and 
timely sharing of genomic research data 
derived from NIH research. As a 
landmark policy, it has played a crucial 
role in facilitating rapid access to 
valuable genomic data while ensuring 
participant protection through rigorous 
informed consent and privacy 
safeguards. Since 2014, NIH has issued 
the NIH Data Management and Sharing 
(DMS) Policy as well as streamlined and 
strengthened its controlled-access 
practices, including: 
€harmonizing the oversight and management of controlled-access data 
repositories and access management 
systems (see: https://grants.nih.gov/ 
grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25- 
159.html), 
€modernizing security standards for controlled-access data subject to the 
GDS Policy (see: https://grants.nih.gov/ 
grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-24- 
157.html), 
€establishing minimum expectations for access to controlled-access data by 
developers (see: https://grants.nih.gov/ 
grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-24- 
157.html), and 
€prohibiting access to NIH controlled-access data repositories and 
associated data by institutions located 
in countries of concern (see: https://
grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/ 
NOT-OD-25-083.html). 
NIH is proposing to revise the GDS 
Policy to enhance efficiency and reduce 
redundancies with these recent 
directives and policy developments. 
NIH requests public input on both the 
Draft NIH Controlled-Access Data Policy 
and the proposed revisions to the NIH 
Genomic Data Sharing Policy. 
NIH Controlled-Access Data Policy 
Scope and Applicability 
This Policy applies to all NIH- 
supported research generating human 
data or deriving data from human data, 
cell lines, or biospecimens. This Policy 
applies to the NIH Intramural Research 
Program and all NIH funding 
mechanisms (e.g., grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, Other 
Transactions), regardless of activity 
code. 
This Policy does not apply to NIH 
research that only involves: 
€Generation and sharing of non- human data 
€Collection and sharing of human cell lines and biospecimens (see: 
https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/ 
notice-files/NOT-OD-25-160.html) 
Human data or data derived from 
human cell lines or biospecimens 
already shared prior to the effective date 
of this Policy should be assessed for risk 
but are not required to be controlled to 
comport with this Policy. Additionally, 
this Policy is not intended to address 
sharing data for regulatory approval or 
to comply with regulatory requirements 
(e.g. submission of data to regulatory approval bodies). 
Requirements 
Human Data Types Required To Be 
Protected Through Controlled-Access 
(see Appendix for Definitions) The following data types, listed 
below, must be protected throughout the 
data lifecycle. Institutions conducting 
NIH-supported research must ensure 
that these data types are protected even 
if not sharing through a controlled- 
access data repository. These categories 
are based on the data types provided in 
28 CFR part 202, as well as other data 
commonly generated or used in NIH- 
supported research that warrant 
additional controls. These data types 
may only be shared without access 
controls if (1) there is informed consent 
explicitly stating data are to be shared 
openly without controls. In these 
instances, institutions must still review 
to determine that openly sharing these

Requirements for Controlled-Access 
Data Sharing 
Controlled-access data repositories 
sharing human participant data types 
identified in this Policy must adhere to 
security and operational standards 
appropriate for safeguarding of human 
data. NIH Controlled-Access Data 
Repositories (CADRs) subject to the 
‘‘Required Security and Operational 
Standards for NIH Controlled-Access 
Data Repositories’’ are fully compliant 
with the requirements of this Policy 
(https://grants.nih.gov/policy-and- 
compliance/policy-topics/sharing- 
policies/accessing-data/requirements). 
Other controlled-access data 
repositories can meet the requirements 
of this policy if, at a minimum, their 
security and operational standards 
include: 
€Prospective review of requests to access controlled data; 
€Authentication of the identity of data requesters; 
€Restrictions for sharing data with countries of concern as identified in 
Part 202; and 
€Employing security standards for protection of controlled data (e.g., 
NIST–SP–800–171 or equivalent). 
NIH does not consider repositories 
only requiring user registration and/or 
provide non-binding guidance on data 
usage to be controlled-access 
repositories. 
Additional Policy Considerations 
Data not explicitly required to be 
managed via controlled-access under 
this Policy should be assessed for the 
need for controls. Criteria for making 
these assessments include any of the 
following:

use, such as those imposed by laws, 
regulations, policies, informed consent, 
and agreements. 
2. Potential sensitivities, such as 
information regarding potentially 
stigmatizing traits, illegal behaviors, or 
other information that could be 
perceived as causing group harm or 
used for discriminatory purposes. 
Sensitive data may also include data 
from individuals, groups, or populations 
with unique attributes that increase the 
risk of re-identification. 
3. Lack of adequate data de- 
identification or the possibility of re- 
identification cannot sufficiently be 
reduced. 
Proposed Revisions to the NIH Genomic 
Data Sharing Policy 
NIH is proposing several revisions to 
the GDS Policy to reduce duplicative 
policy requirements and improve 
overall performance. Importantly, the 
core tenets of this policy will remain 
intact. The effective date for changes 
will align with the target effective date 
of the NIH Controlled-Access Data 
Policy described above. 
Proposed GDS Policy revisions: 
1. The scope of the GDS Policy is proposed to be revised as follows: 
€Apply only to human data. The NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy 
(DMS Policy) encompasses all types of 
scientific data, including genomic data. 
The GDS Policy scope will apply 
specifically to human genomic data to 
outline the specific protections needed 
to ensure participant autonomy, 
privacy, and security. Non-human 
genomic data will no longer be subject 
to the GDS Policy. 
€Simplify thresholds for ‘‘large scale’’ genomic data. Any amount of human genomic data collected from 100 
individuals or more will be defined as 
‘‘large scale’’ and required to comply 
with the GDS Policy’s consent and data 
sharing requirements. Studies 
generating and sharing human genomic 
data below this threshold will be subject 
to the expectations of the DMS Policy 
and the proposed NIH Controlled- 
Access Data Policy described above. 
€Establish consistent requirements across NIH. To reduce complexity, NIH 
Institutes, Centers, and Offices (ICOs) 
will not be permitted to expand the 
scope of the GDS Policy through 
individual program or policy 
expectations. While ICs may request 
additional data protections or 
submission of data to NIH controlled- 
access repositories in NOFOs, they may 
not characterize these requests as 
modifying the expectations of the GDS 
Policy. These data submissions will be 
governed by the DMS Policy, the 
‘‘Required Security and Operational 
Standards for NIH Controlled-Access 
Data Repositories,’’ the proposed NIH 
Controlled-Access Data Policy, and 
other relevant policies. 
2. Timelines for Data Processing: Timing of data release will be removed 
from the GDS Policy as data release 
should be immediate, depending on 
repository operations. The levels of data 
processing previously provided in 
supplementary information to the GDS 
Policy will no longer be used. Human 
genomic data should be submitted to an 
approved NIH controlled-access data 
repository (see: https://grants.nih.gov/ 
policy-and-compliance/policy-topics/ 
sharing-policies/accessing-data/best- 
practices) to make the data available 
within 6 months of generation, to allow 
time for data cleaning, quality control, 
and repository release processes. Initial 
sequence reads and raw data do not 
have to be shared, consistent with 
previous GDS Policy expectations. Data 
not shared within 6 months of data 
cleaning and quality control should be 
shared consistent with DMS Policy 
requirements (publication date or end of 
the award period, whichever comes 
first). 
3. NIH proposes modernizing the following data submission and sharing 
practices by: 
€Clarifying expectations for sharing human genomic data openly. 
Expectations for sharing genomic data 
(and other omics data) openly or with 
controls will be entirely governed by the 
proposed NIH Controlled-Access Data 
Policy, including expectations for 
informed consent to share data openly. 
€Allowing for HIPAA Expert Determination. Identifiers are allowed to be submitted under the GDS Policy so 
long as the dataset is de-identified 
according to Expert Determination and 
is accepted by the controlled-access data 
repository. Data derived from human 
research participants must be de- 
identified according to the following 
standards: 
ÆIdentities of research participants cannot be readily ascertained or 
otherwise associated with the data by 
the repository staff or secondary data 
users (45 CFR 46.102(e); Federal Policy 
for the Protection of Human Subjects); 
and 
ÆEither remove 18 identifiers enumerated at 45 CFR 164.514(b)(2) (the 
HIPAA Privacy Rule) or meet the Expert 
Determination standard according to 45 
CFR 164.514(b)(1) 
€Expanding institutional review capacity. Institutions are permitted to appoint an individual or institutional 
body technically and legally capable of 
reviewing Institutional Certifications for 
data submission beyond an Institutional 
Review Board, Privacy Board, or 
equivalent. For example, Human 
Research Protection Programs (HRPPs) 
would be permitted to review and 
approve data submissions. 
€Strengthening requirements for participant consent. Human genomic 
data collected under the GDS Policy 
from biospecimens or cell lines created 
or collected after 2015 must have 
consent for use and sharing, consistent 
with 45 CFR 46.116(d) (the Common 
Rule). If consent has not been obtained, 
the data cannot be shared. NIH accepts 
data when collected under informed 
consent for research use from a Legally 
Authorized Representative, consistent 
with the Common Rule, as long as the 
consent meets other expectations of the 
GDS Policy (e.g., consent is expected to be for future research use and be opt-in, 
not opt-out). This includes, but is not 
limited to, the following situations: 
€Consent is obtained from next-of- kin or applicable legal authority in cases 
where the individual is deceased 
€Consent is obtained from a Legally Authorized Representative, next-of-kin, 
or other forms of surrogate or proxy 
decision-making in cases where the 
individual lacks capacity to consent for 
themselves 
€Assent is obtained from minors, with parental permission 
€Updating expectations for imputation servers. NIH currently 
allows Approved Users to use 
imputation servers for imputation with 
controlled-access data from studies 
subject to the GDS Policy only in 
limited circumstances, such as the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute (NHLBI) Trans-Omics in 
Precision Medicine (TOPMed) 
Imputation Server. Specifically, these 
servers offer a secure environment for 
users to upload genotypes, the results 
are encrypted, and after 7 days the data 
are deleted from the server upholding 
the non-transferability agreement in the 
Data Use Certification (DUC) 
Agreement. The server operates in an 
environment consistent with security 
standards in the NIH Security Best 
Practices for Controlled-Access Data 
Repositories and employs 
countermeasures to reduce the risks of 
certain attacks. 
NIH currently does not allow users to 
develop their own imputation panels or 
servers. NIH has heard interest from the 
research community in allowing 
Approved Users to develop their own 
imputation panels and servers using 
controlled-access data from studies 
subject to the GDS Policy. NIH requests 
input on clarifying that Approved Users

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159134 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices may operate imputation servers if they 
ensure that (1) the controlled-access 
data used to develop the imputation 
panels are protected from disclosure 
and attacks specific to imputation 
servers, (2) the imputation server 
operates in an environment consistent 
with security controls in the NIH 
Security Best Practices for Controlled- 
Access Data Repositories and, (3) the 
imputation servers are funded or 
operated by NIH or another federal 
agency. 
Request for Input 
NIH invites public input on any 
aspect of the Draft NIH Controlled- 
Access Data Policy and the proposed 
revisions to the NIH Genomic Data 
Sharing Policy. Input is specifically 
requested on: 
1. Availability of established repositories for implementing the 
proposed Controlled-Access Data 
Policy. NIH has made investments in expanding the capacity of controlled- 
access data repositories (see: https://
grants.nih.gov/policy-and-compliance/ 
policy-topics/sharing-policies/ 
accessing-data/best-practices) and is 
interested in additional resources that 
may be needed to meet an anticipated 
increased demand for storing and 
managing larger amounts of controlled- 
access data. 
2. Appropriateness of the protected data types designated to be controlled- 
access. The data types subject to the Controlled-Access Data Policy, 
including whether any should be added, 
removed, or definitions clarified (e.g., 
whether NIH should consider adding 
thresholds for the number of analytes 
for particular data types). Additionally, 
any factors that should be considered 
when sharing data openly without 
controls, given the Draft Controlled- 
Access Data Policy’s requirements for 
informed consent and institutional 
review. NIH may provide FAQs or 
additional guidance on data types that 
typically should not be controlled, such 
as genomic summary results, 
summarized result data (including from 
clinical trials), and specific low-risk 
components of controlled-access data. 
3. Proposed Updates to the GDS Policy for Imputation Servers. NIH is 
interested in options or strategies that 
maintain the privacy of imputation 
servers and reference panels, such as 
technologies that operate servers in 
secure environments or use privacy 
enhancing technologies (PETs). 
Appendix to the Controlled-Access 
Policy: Definitions 
€Genomic summary results. The output of analyses of genomic data 
across many individuals included 
within a dataset. Includes systematically 
computed statistics such as, but not 
limited to: (1) frequency information 
(e.g., genotype counts and frequencies, or allele counts and frequencies); and 
(2) association information (e.g., effect size estimates and standard errors, and 
p-values). These values may be defined 
and calculated using scientifically 
relevant subsets of research participants 
included within study populations (e.g., 
disease, trait-based, or control 
populations). 
€Covered personal identifiers. Any listed identifier: (1) In combination with 
any other listed identifier; or (2) In 
combination with other data that is 
disclosed such that the listed identifier 
is linked or linkable to other listed 
identifiers or to other sensitive personal 
data. This excludes (1) Demographic or 
contact data that is linked only to other 
demographic or contact data (such as 
first and last name, birthplace, ZIP code, 
residential street or postal address, 
phone number, and email address and 
similar public account identifiers); and 
(2) A network-based identifier, account- 
authentication data, or call-detail data 
that is linked only to other network- 
based identifier, account-authentication 
data, or call-detail data as necessary for 
the provision of telecommunications, 
networking, or similar service (28 
CFR 202.212). 
€Listed identifier. Any piece of data in any of the following data fields: (a) 
Full or truncated government 
identification or account number (such 
as a Social Security number, driver’s 
license or State identification number, 
passport number, or Alien Registration 
Number); (b) Full financial account 
numbers or personal identification 
numbers associated with a financial 
institution or financial-services 
company; (c) Device-based or hardware- 
based identifier (such as International 
Mobile Equipment Identity (‘‘IMEI’’), 
Media Access Control (‘‘MAC’’) address, 
or Subscriber Identity Module (‘‘SIM’’) 
card number); (d) Demographic or 
contact data (such as first and last name, 
birth date, birthplace, ZIP code, 
residential street or postal address, 
phone number, email address, or similar 
public account identifiers); (e) 
Advertising identifier (such as Google 
Advertising ID, Apple ID for 
Advertisers, or other mobile advertising 
ID (‘‘MAID’’)); (f) Account- 
authentication data (such as account 
username, account password, or an 
answer to security questions); (g) 
Network-based identifier (such as 
internet Protocol (‘‘IP’’) address or 
cookie data); or (h) Call-detail data (such 
as Customer Proprietary Network 
Information (‘‘CPNI’’) (28 CFR 202.212). 
€Precise geolocation data. Data, whether real-time or historical, that 
identifies the physical location of an 
individual or a device with a precision 
of within 1,000 meters (28 CFR 
202.242). 
€Biometric identifiers. Measurable physical characteristics or behaviors 
used to recognize or verify the identity 
of an individual, including facial 
images, voice prints and patterns, retina 
and iris scans, palm prints and 
fingerprints, gait, and keyboard usage 
patterns that are enrolled in a biometric 
system and the templates created by the 
system (28 CFR 202.204). 
€Genomic data. Data representing the nucleic acid sequences that 
constitute the entire set or a subset of 
the genetic instructions found in a 
human cell, including the result or 
results of an individual’s ‘‘genetic test’’ 
(as defined in 42 U.S.C. 300gg– 
91(d)(17)) and any related human 
genetic sequencing data (28 
CFR 202.224). 
€Epigenomic data. Data derived from a systems-level analysis of human 
epigenetic modifications, which are 
changes in gene expression that do not 
involve alterations to the DNA sequence 
itself. These epigenetic modifications 
include modifications such as DNA 
methylation, histone modifications, and 
non-coding RNA regulation. Routine 
clinical measurements of epigenetic 
modifications for individualized patient 
care purposes would not be considered 
epigenomic data because such 
measurements would not entail a 
systems-level analysis of the epigenetic 
modifications in a sample (28 
CFR 202.224). 
€Proteomic data. Data derived from a systems-level analysis of proteins 
expressed by a human genome, cell, 
tissue, or organism. Routine clinical 
measurements of proteins for 
individualized patient care purposes 
would not be considered proteomic data 
under this rule because such 
measurements would not entail a 
systems-level analysis of the proteins 
found in such a sample (28 
CFR 202.224). 
€Transcriptomic data. Data derived from a systems-level analysis of RNA 
transcripts produced by the human 
genome under specific conditions or in 
a specific cell type. Routine clinical 
measurements of RNA transcripts for 
individualized patient care purposes 
would not be considered transcriptomic 
data under this rule because such 
measurements would not entail a 
systems-level analysis of the RNA

Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), and 
where applicable, in the supporting 
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) reports, 
prepared by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) for each

the listed communities. 
From the date of the second 
publication of notification of these 
changes in a newspaper of local 
circulation, any person has 90 days in

Administrator for the Federal Insurance 
Directorate, Resilience, reconsider the 
changes. The flood hazard

(FEMA) has provided to the affected 
communities. The FIRM and FIS report 
are the basis of the floodplain 
management measures that the 
community is required either to adopt 
or to show evidence of having in effect 
in order to qualify or remain qualified 
for participation in the National Flood 
Insurance Program (NFIP). 
DATES: Comments are to be submitted on or before March 18, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: The Preliminary FIRM, and where applicable, the FIS report for 
each community are available for 
inspection at both the online location 
https://hazards.fema.gov/femaportal/ 
prelimdownload and the respective Community Map Repository address 
listed in the tables below. Additionally, 
the current effective FIRM and FIS 
report for each community are 
accessible online through the FEMA 
Map Service Center at https://
msc.fema.gov for comparison. You may submit comments, identified 
by Docket No. FEMA–B–2567, to David

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
David N. Bascom, Acting Director, 
Engineering and Modeling Division, 
National Flood Insurance Program, 
Resilience, FEMA, 400 C Street SW, 
Washington, DC 20472, or (email)

eXchange (FMIX) online at https://
www.floodmaps.fema.gov/fhm/fmx_main.html. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FEMA proposes to make flood hazard 
determinations for each community 
listed below, in accordance with section 
110 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act 
of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 
67.4(a). 
These proposed flood hazard 
determinations, together with the 
floodplain management criteria required 
by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that 
are required. They should not be 
construed to mean that the community 
must change any existing ordinances 
that are more stringent in their 
floodplain management requirements. 
The community may at any time enact 
stricter requirements of its own or 
pursuant to policies established by other 
Federal, State, or regional entities. 
These flood hazard determinations are 
used to meet the floodplain 
management requirements of the NFIP. 
The communities affected by the 
flood hazard determinations are 
provided in the tables below. Any 
request for reconsideration of the 
revised flood hazard information shown 
on the Preliminary FIRM and FIS report 
that satisfies the data requirements 
outlined in 44 CFR 67.6(b) is considered 
an appeal. Comments unrelated to the 
flood hazard determinations also will be 
considered before the FIRM and FIS 
report become effective. 
Use of a Scientific Resolution Panel 
(SRP) is available to communities in 
support of the appeal resolution 
process. SRPs are independent panels of 
experts in hydrology, hydraulics, and 
other pertinent sciences established to 
review conflicting scientific and 
technical data and provide 
recommendations for resolution. Use of 
the SRP only may be exercised after 
FEMA and local communities have been 
engaged in a collaborative consultation 
process for at least 60 days without a 
mutually acceptable resolution of an 
appeal. Additional information 
regarding the SRP process can be found 
online at https://www.floodsrp.org/pdfs/ 
srp_overview.pdf. The watersheds and/or communities 
affected are listed in the tables below. 
The Preliminary FIRM, and where 
applicable, FIS report for each 
community are available for inspection 
at both the online location https://
hazards.fema.gov/femaportal/ 
prelimdownload and the respective Community Map Repository address 
listed in the tables. For communities 
with multiple ongoing Preliminary 
studies, the studies can be identified by 
the unique project number and 
Preliminary FIRM date listed in the 
tables. Additionally, the current 
effective FIRM and FIS report for each 
community are accessible online 
through the FEMA Map Service Center 
at https://msc.fema.gov for comparison. (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance No.

Proposed Flood Hazard 
Determinations 
AGENCY: Federal Emergency Management Agency, Department of 
Homeland Security. 
ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Comments are requested on proposed flood hazard determinations, 
which may include additions or 
modifications of any Base Flood 
Elevation (BFE), base flood depth, 
Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) 
boundary or zone designation, or 
regulatory floodway on the Flood 
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), and 
where applicable, in the supporting 
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) reports for 
the communities listed in the table 
below. The purpose of this notice is to 
seek general information and comment 
regarding the preliminary FIRM, and 
where applicable, the FIS report that the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) has provided to the affected 
communities. The FIRM and FIS report 
are the basis of the floodplain 
management measures that the 
community is required either to adopt 
or to show evidence of having in effect 
in order to qualify or remain qualified 
for participation in the National Flood 
Insurance Program (NFIP). 
DATES: Comments are to be submitted on or before March 18, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: The Preliminary FIRM, and where applicable, the FIS report for 
each community are available for 
inspection at both the online location 
https://hazards.fema.gov/femaportal/ 
prelimdownload and the respective Community Map Repository address 
listed in the tables below. Additionally, 
the current effective FIRM and FIS 
report for each community are 
accessible online through the FEMA 
Map Service Center at https://
msc.fema.gov for comparison. You may submit comments, identified 
by Docket No. FEMA–B–2569, to David

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FEMA proposes to make flood hazard 
determinations for each community 
listed below, in accordance with section 
110 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act 
of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 
67.4(a). 
These proposed flood hazard 
determinations, together with the 
floodplain management criteria required 
by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that 
are required. They should not be 
construed to mean that the community 
must change any existing ordinances 
that are more stringent in their 
floodplain management requirements. 
The community may at any time enact 
stricter requirements of its own or 
pursuant to policies established by other 
Federal, State, or regional entities. 
These flood hazard determinations are 
used to meet the floodplain 
management requirements of the NFIP. 
The communities affected by the 
flood hazard determinations are 
provided in the tables below. Any 
request for reconsideration of the 
revised flood hazard information shown 
on the Preliminary FIRM and FIS report 
that satisfies the data requirements 
outlined in 44 CFR 67.6(b) is considered 
an appeal. Comments unrelated to the 
flood hazard determinations also will be 
considered before the FIRM and FIS 
report become effective. 
Use of a Scientific Resolution Panel 
(SRP) is available to communities in 
support of the appeal resolution 
process. SRPs are independent panels of 
experts in hydrology, hydraulics, and 
other pertinent sciences established to 
review conflicting scientific and 
technical data and provide 
recommendations for resolution. Use of 
the SRP only may be exercised after 
FEMA and local communities have been 
engaged in a collaborative consultation 
process for at least 60 days without a 
mutually acceptable resolution of an 
appeal. Additional information 
regarding the SRP process can be found 
online at https://www.floodsrp.org/pdfs/ 
srp_overview.pdf. The watersheds and/or communities 
affected are listed in the tables below. 
The Preliminary FIRM, and where 
applicable, FIS report for each 
community are available for inspection 
at both the online location https://
hazards.fema.gov/femaportal/ 
prelimdownload and the respective Community Map Repository address 
listed in the tables. For communities 
with multiple ongoing Preliminary 
studies, the studies can be identified by 
the unique project number and 
Preliminary FIRM date listed in the 
tables. Additionally, the current 
effective FIRM and FIS report for each 
community are accessible online 
through the FEMA Map Service Center 
at https://msc.fema.gov for comparison. (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance No.

where applicable, in the supporting 
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) reports, 
prepared by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) for each

the listed communities. 
From the date of the second 
publication of notification of these 
changes in a newspaper of local 
circulation, any person has 90 days in 
which to request through the 
community that the Assistant 
Administrator for the Federal Insurance 
Directorate, Resilience, reconsider the 
changes. The flood hazard 
determination information may be 
changed during the 90-day period. 
ADDRESSES: The affected communities are listed in the table below. Revised 
flood hazard information for each 
community is available for inspection at 
both the online location and the

and are in accordance with the National 
Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 
4001 et seq., and with 44 CFR part 65. The FIRM and FIS report are the basis 
of the floodplain management measures 
that the community is required either to

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) makes the final flood hazard 
determinations as shown in the LOMRs 
for each community listed in the table 
below. Notice of these modified flood 
hazard determinations has been 
published in newspapers of local 
circulation and 90 days have elapsed 
since that publication. The Assistant 
Administrator for the Federal Insurance 
Directorate, Resilience, has resolved any 
appeals resulting from this notification. 
The modified flood hazard 
determinations are made pursuant to 
section 206 of the Flood Disaster 
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, 
and are in accordance with the National 
Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 
4001 et seq., and with 44 CFR part 65. The current effective community 
number is shown and must be used for 
all new policies and renewals. 
The new or modified flood hazard 
information is the basis for the 
floodplain management measures that 
the community is required either to 
adopt or to show evidence of being 
already in effect in order to remain 
qualified for participation in the 
National Flood Insurance Program 
(NFIP). 
This new or modified flood hazard 
information, together with the 
floodplain management criteria required 
by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that 
are required. They should not be 
construed to mean that the community 
must change any existing ordinances 
that are more stringent in their 
floodplain management requirements. 
The community may at any time enact 
stricter requirements of its own or 
pursuant to policies established by other 
Federal, State, or regional entities. 
This new or modified flood hazard 
determinations are used to meet the 
floodplain management requirements of 
the NFIP. The changes in flood hazard 
determinations are in accordance with 
44 CFR 65.4. 
Interested lessees and owners of real 
property are encouraged to review the 
final flood hazard information available

Changes in Flood Hazard 
Determinations 
AGENCY: Federal Emergency Management Agency, Department of 
Homeland Security. 
ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice lists communities where the addition or modification of 
Base Flood Elevations (BFEs), base flood 
depths, Special Flood Hazard Area 
(SFHA) boundaries or zone 
designations, or the regulatory floodway 
(hereinafter referred to as flood hazard 
determinations), as shown on the Flood 
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), and 
where applicable, in the supporting 
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) reports, 
prepared by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) for each 
community, is appropriate because of 
new scientific or technical data. The 
FIRM, and where applicable, portions of 
the FIS report, have been revised to 
reflect these flood hazard 
determinations through issuance of a 
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), in 
accordance with Federal Regulations. 
The current effective community 
number is shown in the table below and 
must be used for all new policies and 
renewals. 
DATES: These flood hazard determinations will be finalized on the 
dates listed in the table below and 
revise the FIRM panels and FIS report 
in effect prior to this determination for 
the listed communities. 
From the date of the second 
publication of notification of these 
changes in a newspaper of local 
circulation, any person has 90 days in 
which to request through the 
community that the Assistant 
Administrator for the Federal Insurance 
Directorate, Resilience, reconsider the 
changes. The flood hazard 
determination information may be 
changed during the 90-day period. 
ADDRESSES: The affected communities are listed in the table below. Revised 
flood hazard information for each 
community is available for inspection at 
both the online location and the 
respective community map repository 
address listed in the table below. 
Additionally, the current effective FIRM 
and FIS report for each community are 
accessible online through the FEMA 
Map Service Center at https://
msc.fema.gov for comparison. Submit comments and/or appeals to 
the Chief Executive Officer of the 
community as listed in the table below. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
David N. Bascom, Acting Director, 
Engineering and Modeling Division, 
National Flood Insurance Program, 
Resilience, FEMA, 400 C Street SW, 
Washington, DC 20472, or (email) 
david.bascom@fema.dhs.gov; or visit the FEMA Mapping and Insurance 
eXchange (FMIX) online at https://
www.floodmaps.fema.gov/fhm/fmx_
main.html. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The specific flood hazard determinations are 
not described for each community in 
this notice. However, the online 
location and local community map 
repository address where the flood 
hazard determination information is 
available for inspection is provided. 
Any request for reconsideration of 
flood hazard determinations must be 
submitted to the Chief Executive Officer 
of the community as listed in the table 
below. 
The modifications are made pursuant 
to section 201 of the Flood Disaster 
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, 
and are in accordance with the National 
Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 
4001 et seq., and with 44 CFR part 65. The FIRM and FIS report are the basis 
of the floodplain management measures 
that the community is required either to 
adopt or to show evidence of having in 
effect in order to qualify or remain 
qualified for participation in the 
National Flood Insurance Program 
(NFIP). 
These flood hazard determinations, 
together with the floodplain 
management criteria required by 44 CFR 
60.3, are the minimum that are required. 
They should not be construed to mean 
that the community must change any 
existing ordinances that are more 
stringent in their floodplain 
management requirements. The 
community may at any time enact 
stricter requirements of its own or 
pursuant to policies established by other 
Federal, State, or regional entities. The 
flood hazard determinations are in 
accordance with 44 CFR 65.4.

DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY 
Office of the Secretary 
Determination Pursuant to Section 102 
of the Illegal Immigration Reform and 
Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, 
as Amended 
AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, Department of Homeland Security. 
ACTION: Notice of determination. SUMMARY: The Secretary of Homeland Security has determined, pursuant to 
law, that it is necessary to waive certain 
laws, regulations, and other legal 
requirements in order to ensure the 
expeditious construction of barriers and 
roads in the vicinity of the international 
land border in the state of New Mexico. 
DATES: This determination takes effect on December 18, 2025. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Important mission requirements of the Department 
of Homeland Security (‘‘DHS’’) include 
border security and the detection and 
prevention of illegal entry into the 
United States. Border security is critical 
to the nation’s national security. 
Recognizing the critical importance of 
border security, Congress has mandated 
DHS to achieve and maintain 
operational control of the international 
land border. Secure Fence Act of 2006, 
Public Law 109–367, section 2, 120 Stat. 
2638 (Oct. 26, 2006) (8 U.S.C. 1701 
note). Congress defined ‘‘operational 
control’’ as the prevention of all 
unlawful entries into the United States, 
including entries by terrorists, other 
unlawful aliens, instruments of 
terrorism, narcotics, and other 
contraband. Id. Consistent with that mandate, the President’s Executive 
Order on Securing Our Borders directs 
that I take all appropriate action to 
deploy and construct physical barriers 
to ensure complete operational control 
of the southern border of the United 
States. Executive Order 14165, section 3 
(Jan. 20, 2025). 
Congress has provided to the 
Secretary of Homeland Security a 
number of authorities necessary to carry 
out DHS’s border security mission. One 
of those authorities is found at section 
102 of the Illegal Immigration Reform 
and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 
1996, as amended (‘‘IIRIRA’’). Public 
Law 104–208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009– 
546, 3009–554 (Sept. 30, 1996) (8 U.S.C.

Secure Fence Act of 2006, Public Law 
109–367, section 3, 120 Stat. 2638 (Oct. 
26, 2006) (8 U.S.C. 1103 note), as 
amended by the Department of 
Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 
2008, Public Law 110–161, Div. E, Title 
V, section 564, 121 Stat. 2090 (Dec. 26, 
2007). In section 102(a) of IIRIRA, 
Congress provided that the Secretary of 
Homeland Security shall take such 
actions as may be necessary to install 
additional physical barriers and roads 
(including the removal of obstacles to 
detection of illegal entrants) in the 
vicinity of the United States border to 
deter illegal crossings in areas of high 
illegal entry into the United States. In 
section 102(b) of IIRIRA, Congress 
mandated that in carrying out the 
authority of section 102(a), I provide for 
the installation of additional fencing, 
barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and 
sensors to achieve and maintain 
operational control of the border. 
Finally, in section 102(c) of IIRIRA, 
Congress granted to the Secretary of 
Homeland Security the authority to 
waive all legal requirements that I, in 
my sole discretion, determine necessary 
to ensure the expeditious construction 
of barriers and roads authorized by 
section 102 of IIRIRA. 
Determination and Waiver 
Section 1 
The El Paso Sector is an area of high 
illegal entry. Between fiscal year 2021 
and fiscal year 2025, Border Patrol 
apprehended over 1,232,000 illegal 
aliens attempting to enter the United 
States between border crossings in the 
El Paso Sector. In that same time period, 
Border Patrol seized over 14,734 pounds 
of marijuana, over 1,623 pounds of 
cocaine, over 42 pounds of heroin, over 
3,139 pounds of methamphetamine, and 
over 255 pounds of fentanyl. 
Since the President took office, DHS 
has delivered the most secure border in 
history. More can and must be done, 
however. As the statistics cited above 
demonstrate, the El Paso Sector is an 
area of high illegal entry where illegal 
aliens regularly attempt to enter the 
United States and smuggle illicit drugs, 
and given my mandate to achieve and 
maintain operational control of the 
border, I must use my authority under 
section 102 of IIRIRA to install 
additional barriers and roads in the El 
Paso Sector. Therefore, DHS will take 
immediate action to construct 
additional barriers and roads in a 
segment of the border in the El Paso 
Sector. The segment where such 
construction will occur is referred to 
herein as the ‘‘project area,’’ which is 
more specifically described in Section 2 
below. 
Section 2 
I determine that the following area in 
the vicinity of the United States border, 
located in the state of New Mexico 
within the U. S. Border Patrol El Paso 
Sector, is an area of high illegal entry 
(the ‘‘project area’’): Starting at Border 
Monument 73 and extending east and 
north to Border Monument 47. 
There is presently an acute and 
immediate need to construct additional 
physical barriers and roads in the 
vicinity of the border of the United 
States in order to prevent unlawful 
entries into the United States in the 
project area pursuant to section 102(a) 
and 102(b) of IIRIRA. In order to ensure 
the expeditious construction of 
additional physical barriers and roads in 
the project area, I have determined that 
it is necessary that I exercise the 
authority that is vested in me by section 
102(c) of IIRIRA. 
Accordingly, pursuant to section 
102(c) of IIRIRA, I hereby waive in their 
entirety, with respect to the 
construction of physical barriers and 
roads (including, but not limited to, 
accessing the project areas, creating and 
using staging areas, the conduct of 
earthwork, excavation, fill, and site 
preparation, and installation and 
upkeep of physical barriers, roads, 
supporting elements, drainage, erosion 
controls, safety features, lighting, 
cameras, and sensors) in the project 
area, all of the following statutes, 
including all federal, state, or other 
laws, regulations, and legal 
requirements of, deriving from, or 
related to the subject of, the following 
statutes, as amended: The National

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice informs the public that HUD is 
seeking approval from OMB for the 
information collection described in 
Section A. The Federal Register notice 
that solicited public comment on the 
information collection for a period of 60 
days was published on October 2, 2025 
at 90 FR 47806. 
A. Overview of Information Collection 
Title of Information Collection: 
Standards for Success Reporting. 
OMB Approval Number: 2501–0034. 
Type of Request: Extension. 
Form Number: HUD–PRL. 
Description of the need for the 
information and proposed use: This 
request is for the continued clearance of 
data collection and reporting 
requirements to enable the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) to better assess the 
effectiveness of discretionary-funded 
programs included in this information 
collection request (ICR). The 
discretionary-funded programs included 
in this ICR are the Multifamily Housing 
Service Coordinator Grant Program, the 
Multifamily Housing Budget-based 
Service Coordinator Program, and the 
Resident Opportunity and Self 
Sufficiency Service Coordinator Grant 
Program (ROSS). 
This proposed collection, titled 
Standards for Success Reporting, has 
three key components that improve data 
collection and reporting for 
participating programs. First is the 
standardization of data collection and 
reporting requirements across programs 
which increases data comparability and 
utilization. Second is the ability to 
report on measurable outcomes and to 
align them with higher-level agency 
objectives. And third is the collection of 
record-level data, instead of aggregate 
data. Collecting de-identified data at the 
level of the service recipient allows for 
more meaningful analysis, improved 
management, and the ability to 
demonstrate the progress and 
achievements of the funding recipients 
and the programs. Standards for Success 
accepts data submission by direct data 
input through the HUD-funded 
GrantSolutions online data collection 
and reporting tool (OLDC) and by data 
file upload, accommodating file formats 
in Microsoft Excel or Extensible Markup 
Language (XML). 
Currently across HUD, there are 
several reporting models in place for its 
discretionary programs. The reporting 
models provide information on a wide 
variety of outputs and outcomes and are 
based on unique data definitions and 
outcome measures in program-specific 
performance and progress reports. In 
Fiscal Year 2013, 9 program offices at 
HUD used 6 systems and 15 reporting 
tools to collect over 700 data elements 
in support of varied metrics to assess 
the performance of their funding 
recipients. The proposed data collection 
and reporting requirements described in 
this notice are designed to provide HUD 
programs with a tested alternative to 
their existing disparate reporting 
methodologies, forms, systems, and 
requirements. 
The lack of standardized data 
collection and reporting requirements 
imposes an increased burden on 
funding recipients with multiple HUD 
funding streams. The need for a 
comprehensive standardized reporting 
approach is underscored by reviews 
conducted by external oversight 
agencies, including the HUD Office of 
Inspector General (OIG) and the 
Government Accountability Office 
(GAO). These oversight agencies have 
questioned the soundness and 
comparability of data reported by HUD 
prior to Standards for Success. To 
address these issues, HUD is using its 
statutory and regulatory authority to 
improve and strengthen performance 
reporting for its discretionary programs. 
The Secretary’s statutory and 
regulatory authority to administer 
housing and urban development 
programs include provisions allowing 
for the requirement of performance 
reporting from funding recipients. This 
legal authority is codified at 42 U.S.C. 
3535(r). The individual privacy of 
service recipients is of the highest 
priority. The reporting repository 
established at HUD to receive data 
submission from funding recipients will 
not include any personally identifiable 
information (PII). Additionally, if the 
data from a funding recipient has 25 or 
fewer individuals served during a fiscal 
year as reported in the record-level 
reports, then the results for the 
demographic data elements for the 25 or 
fewer individuals will also be redacted 
or removed from the public-use data file 
and any publicly available analytical 
products in order to ensure the inability 
to identify any individual. 
Eligible entities receiving funding by 
HUD are expected to implement the 
proposed recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements with available HUD funds. 
It is important to note that affected HUD 
funding recipients are required to only 
submit a subset of the universe of data 
elements presented. The participating 
HUD program offices determine the 
specific data collection and reporting 
requirements, which considers the type 
and level of service provided by the 
respective HUD program. 
The reporting requirements in this 
proposal better organize the data than 
participating programs collected in the 
past, standardize outcomes and 
performance measures, and allow 
program offices at HUD to select which 
data elements are relevant for their 
respective programs. Documents 
detailing the data elements are available 
for review by request from Malik

information reported to HUD will be 
submitted electronically. Funding 
recipients may use existing management 
information systems provided those 
systems collect all the required data 
elements and can be exported for 
submission to HUD. Funding recipients 
that sub-award funds to other 
organizations will need to collect the 
required information from their 
subrecipients. 
Information collected and reported 
will be used by funding recipients and 
HUD for the following purposes: 
€To continuously improve the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of 
discretionary-funded programs; 
€To provide management information for use by HUD in program 
administration and oversight, including 
the scoring of applications and the 
monitoring of funding-recipient 
participation, services, and outcomes; 
€To provide data for program evaluation; and 
€To better measure and analyze performance information to identify 
successful practices to be replicated and 
prevent or correct problematic practices 
and improve outcomes in compliance 
with the Government Performance and 
Results Act (GPRA) and the GPRA 
Modernization Act. 
The data collection and reporting 
requirements may expand to other HUD 
programs. Program implementation will 
be determined by the program. HUD 
will provide technical assistance to 
funding recipients throughout the 
implementation.

Abstract of Information Available 
A total of one cultural item has been

Bidwell of Pittsfield, MA in 1877, and 
transferred to the Berkshire Museum in 
1906. The donor was the cousin of 
Mercy Patridge Whitney. The object was 
first described in 1899 by William T. 
Brigham in his study of Hawaiian 
featherwork. The museum lacks 
sufficient documentation regarding the 
acquisition of the 1ahu1ula by Mercy 
Patridge Whitney to establish right of 
ownership or to establish lineal descent.

Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing, at least, 
five individuals have been identified. 
No associated funerary objects are 
present. In 1965, the Sugar Creek Valley 
Chapter of the Archaeological Society of 
Ohio, with the assistance and guidance 
of Raymond C. Vietzen (1907–1995), 
removed multiple individuals from the 
Riker Site in Tuscarawas County, Ohio.

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159163 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices Additional individuals were likely 
removed from the location in 1966, 
1967, and 1970. On an unknown date, 
Vietzen retained or obtained an 
unknown number of individuals from 
the location. While there is no record 
regarding potentially hazardous 
substances having been used to treat the 
human remains, tape, paint, 
unidentified adhesives, an unidentified 
foam or similar type of substance, and 
an unidentified preservative coating, 
consolidant, or sealant are present. It is 
unknown when these materials and 
substances were applied. 
Vietzen, an avocational archaeologist, 
collector, and author, established the 
Indian Ridge Museum in Elyria, Ohio, 
and the Archaeological Society of Ohio 
(formerly the Ohio Indian Relic 
Collectors Society). The Indian Ridge 
Museum, founded in the 1930s, served 
as Vietzen’s laboratory and repository, 
and it remained in operation until the 
mid-1990s. After Vietzen’s death, the 
facility fell into disrepair, and most of 
the items he had acquired and housed 
at the museum were sold. In 1998, the 
Ohio Historical Society (presently the 
Ohio History Connection) removed 
ancestral human remains and some of 
the remaining items from the facility 
and temporarily housed them at the 
Ohio Historical Society. In October of 
2003, these remains were transferred 
from the Ohio Historical Society to 
Mercyhurst College (presently 
Mercyhurst University). 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is reasonably identified by the 
geographical location or acquisition 
history of the human remains described 
in this notice.

human remains consist of one cranium 
and mandible. Archival records 
indicate, ‘‘This skull was exhumed on 
the ranch of Mr. Bell, Rim Rock, 
Arizona in 1935, and was presented by 
Mr. Bell to Dr. Lyon.’’ Dr. B.J. Lyon 
donated this cranium to the Santa 
Barbara Museum of Natural History in 
1936. No associated funerary objects are 
present.

Abstract of Information Available 
In 1930, J.P. Schumacher and others 
associated with the Neville Public 
Museum excavated one of the burial 
mounds located at the site now known 
as the Shoemaker’s Point Mounds and 
Cemetery (47–DR–0043), Door County, 
WI. The mounds were known to 
archaeologists since at least the 
beginning of the 20th century and were 
excavated by various individuals, 
including Schumacher, in many 
campaigns. Schumacher’s 1930 
excavation into the mound removed 
‘‘several bundle burials’’ and one 
Ancestor laying in an extended position 
with a stone pipe in their right hand and 
iron ‘‘trade’’ knife in their left hand. 
Additionally, six iron ‘‘trade’’ arrow 
points were found in the burial. In 1930, 
the Neville Public Museum accessioned 
a ‘‘limestone pipe, a lithic projectile 
point, four iron trade points, and an iron 
trade knife’’ from Schumacher’s 
excavation. No Ancestral remains are 
mentioned in these accession records, 
though are referenced in later records. 
In 1940, the Neville Public Museum 
transferred possession of these funerary 
items and at least two sets of Ancestral 
remains to the Door County Museum, at 
which point they were put on display. 
At an unknown point between 1961– 
1980, Carol Mason, affiliated with the 
University of Wisconsin—Fox Valley, 
acquired the funerary objects, though no 
records exist to explain exactly which 
items and if the associated Ancestral 
remains were also acquired. UWO took 
possession of the funerary objects when 
UWO absorbed the previously-named 
University of Wisconsin—Fox Valley in 
2018. They were identified and 
transferred to UWO main campus in 
2022. While the Ancestor who these 
objects belonged to were once held by 
the Neville Public Museum and the 
Door County Museum, their current 
whereabouts remain unknown. There 
are five associated funerary objects 
present. Of those five associated 
funerary objects, one is missing. The

Abstract of Information Available 
A total of 10 cultural items have been 
requested for repatriation: three sacred 
objects and seven objects of cultural 
patrimony. The three sacred objects are 
a pipe bowl, pipestem, and rattle. The 
pipe bowl is t-shaped, made of catlinite 
(pipestone), and has six ‘‘x’’ shapes 
faintly etched on one side of the pipe. 
The pipestem is wide, flat, and wooden, 
with green painted sections and 
remnants of purple quillwork and red 
and blue ribbon suspensions.

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159171 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices Documents attribute the pipestem to the 
Sioux, circa 1900. The rattle is made of 
leather and has a wooden handle; 
documents estimate that it was made 
circa 1880. 
All three sacred objects described 
above were donated to Augustana 
University’s Center for Western Studies 
in the winter of 2012–2013 by Abbot 
Denis Quinkert and Director Colleen 
Cordell of the American Indian Culture 
Research Center at Blue Cloud Abbey, 
an American Benedictine monastery 
near Marvin, Grant County, South 
Dakota. Through consultation, these 
sacred objects were determined to be 
culturally affiliated with the Flandreau 
Santee Sioux Tribe of South Dakota. 
Augustana University does not have 
information indicating that these sacred 
items were treated with or exposed to 
potentially hazardous substances. 
The seven objects of cultural 
patrimony are three hammer heads, a 
pair of gloves, a spoon, a bowl, and a 
quirt. The three hammer heads are made 
of catlinite (pipestone). None of the 
hammer heads have handles; one has 
leather fringe with a red, white, and 
purple quill-wrapped slat around the 
hammer head. The gloves are made of 
soft hide with partially beaded gauntlets 
that have short leather fringe on the 
edges. The beadwork is of a stylized 
floral design in red, light blue, dark 
blue, and green. Documents attribute 
these gloves to the Santee Sioux, circa 
1900. The spoon is made of bison horn 
and has a bird effigy handle. Documents 
attribute the spoon to the Eastern Sioux, 
circa 1860–1870. The bowl is a slightly 
elongated wooden bowl with carved 
handles. Documents attribute the bowl 
to the Eastern Sioux, with an estimated 
date of pre-1850. The quirt is a sawtooth 
wood quirt with brass tacks on both 
sides; a long strip of leather and a 
feather fragment are attached, along 
with a floral beadwork wrist strap. 
Documents attribute this quirt to the 
Sioux, circa 1880. All seven objects of 
cultural patrimony described above 
were donated to Augustana University’s 
Center for Western Studies in the winter 
of 2012–2013 by Abbot Denis Quinkert 
and Director Colleen Cordell of the 
American Indian Culture Research 
Center at Blue Cloud Abbey, an 
American Benedictine monastery near 
Marvin, Grant County, South Dakota. 
Through consultation, these objects of 
cultural patrimony were determined to 
be culturally affiliated with the 
Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe of South 
Dakota. Augustana University does not 
have information indicating that these 
cultural items were treated with or 
exposed to potentially hazardous 
substances. 
Determinations 
Augustana University has determined 
that: 
€The three sacred objects described in this notice are specific ceremonial 
objects needed by a traditional Native 
American religious leader for present- 
day adherents to practice traditional 
Native American religion, according to 
the Native American traditional 
knowledge of a lineal descendant, 
Indian Tribe, or Native Hawaiian 
organization. 
€The seven objects of cultural patrimony described in this notice have 
ongoing historical, traditional, or 
cultural importance central to the 
Native American group, including any 
constituent sub-group (such as a band, 
clan, lineage, ceremonial society, or 
other subdivision), according to the 
Native American traditional knowledge 
of an Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian 
organization.

Abstract of Information Available 
Based on the available information, 
human remains representing, at least, 14 
individuals have been reasonably 
identified. No associated funerary 
objects are present. Human remains 
representing, at minimum, 14 
individuals were collected in the 
Hawaiian Island. The human remains 
are hair clippings collected from two 
individuals who were recorded as being 
17 years old, five individuals who were 
recorded as being 16 years old, two 
individuals who were recorded as being 
15 years old, one individual recorded as 
being 13 years old and four individuals 
of unknown age. Museum 
documentation indicated the clippings 
are Native American, likely collected by 
Alfred Tozzer as part of a research study 
between 1916 and 1920. It is likely 
Tozzer donated the hair clippings to the 
PMAE. 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the available information

Native American religion, according to 
the Native American traditional 
knowledge of a lineal descendant, 
Indian Tribe, or Native Hawaiian 
organization. 
€The one object of cultural patrimony described in this notice has 
ongoing historical, traditional, or 
cultural importance central to the

Abstract of Information Available 
A total of two cultural items have 
been requested for repatriation. The two 
objects claimed as cultural patrimony 
are two baskets identified in museum 
records as ‘‘Kern County, California.’’ 
FAMSF accessioned a bottleneck basket 
(Acc. 21466) on May 10, 1902 as a gift 
from ‘‘Mr. Ed. McLeod.’’ FAMSF 
accessioned a cup-shaped feather basket 
(Acc. 46767) on December 31, 1919 as 
a gift from Mrs. A.G. Boggs. These 
baskets have been physically on loan to 
the California Department of Parks and 
Recreation (CDPR) since 1958, but are 
under the control of FAMSF. At some 
point after 1958, the bottleneck basket 
(Acc. 21466) was noted as Kawaiisu, 
Shoshonean, and Paiute in CDPR 
collections records. At some point after 
1958, the cup-shaped feather basket 
(Acc. 46767) was noted as Yuki (?), 
Huchnom (?) in CDPR collections 
records. There is no known 
documentation of the presence of any 
potentially hazardous substances used 
to treat any of the cultural items. 
Determinations 
In consultation with affiliated Tribal 
representatives, FAMSF has determined 
that: 
€The two objects of cultural patrimony described in this notice have 
ongoing historical, traditional, or 
cultural importance central to the 
Native American group, including any 
constituent sub-group (such as a band, 
clan, lineage, ceremonial society, or

Bernardino intends to repatriate certain 
cultural items that meet the definition of 
objects of cultural patrimony and that 
have a cultural affiliation with the 
Indian Tribes or Native Hawaiian 
organizations in this notice. 
DATES: Repatriation of the cultural items in this notice may occur on or after 
January 20, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: Send additional, written requests for repatriation of the cultural 
items in this notice to Michael Chavez,

determinations in this notice, including 
the results of consultation, can be found 
in the summary or related records. The 
National Park Service is not responsible 
for the determinations in this notice. 
Abstract of Information Available 
A total of 12 cultural items have been 
requested for repatriation. A total of 11 
objects of cultural patrimony are nine 
arrow shafts, one bow stave and one 
coyote fur quiver. They have a limited 
provenience history but according to the 
appraisal form these objects were 
discovered in the Palm Springs area and 
later donated to CSUSB in 2006 with the 
note ‘‘Morongo’’ included by the donor. 
There is no documentation of testing or 
treatments. 
The 12th object of cultural patrimony 
is a single decorated pottery sherd that 
was discovered and collected from 
private land within the Joshua Tree 
National Park Area in the 1930’s. At this 
time there is no additional provenience 
information for this sherd and given the 
lack of provenience information the 
Joshua Tree National Park team released 
control to CSUSB for the purposes of 
repatriation. This sherd came to CSUSB 
at an undisclosed time. There is no 
documentation of testing or treatment. 
Determinations 
The California State University San 
Bernardino has determined that: 
€The 12 objects of cultural patrimony described in this notice have 
ongoing historical, traditional, or 
cultural importance central to the 
Native American group, including any 
constituent sub-group (such as a band, 
clan, lineage, ceremonial society, or 
other subdivision), according to the 
Native American traditional knowledge 
of an Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian 
organization. 
€There is a connection between the cultural items described in this notice

S–66–1–566). The locations from which 
these two sets of human remains were 
removed are unknown. Another set of 
human remains consists of a femur and 
tibia (cataloged as S–66–1–1173 and S– 
66–1–1174). This individual was 
removed from Ash Cave, Madison 
County, AR. There are no apparent 
hazardous substances present.

Abstract of Information Available 
A total of 13 cultural items have been 
requested for repatriation. The 13 sacred 
objects are prayer offerings. These 
objects were removed from a shrine site, 
likely LA 46316, in Valencia County, 
NM. The site is located on land owned 
by the Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico. 
These objects were removed from the 
site by Harmon Maxon (a University of 
New Mexico student) of Santa Fe, who 
later gave them to a University of 
Oklahoma professor, who in turn 
donated them to SNOMNH. Official 
representatives of the Pueblo of Acoma 
and Pueblo of Laguna reviewed these 
objects in person and identified and 
confirmed that they are sacred objects 
and culturally affiliated with the Pueblo 
of Acoma and Pueblo of Laguna. 
In the past, hazardous substances 
were used to treat the Ethnology 
Collection at SNOMNH. The Ethnology 
Collection in part or whole was exposed 
to Paradichlorobenzene (PBD in textile 
storage-discontinued around or before 
1981), Naphthalene (moth flake packets 
stored with textiles-discontinued 
around 1985), and Vapona (no-pest- 
strips (active ingredient: Dichlorvos 
DDVP) and pyrethrins, placed in cases 
with objects, discontinued around 
1986). None of these products were ever 
in direct contact with objects. Any 
potential treatments of these objects by 
donors are unknown. The building 
where the Ethnology collection was 
previously stored was subject to 
fumigation multiple times per year from 
1983–1985, using Vapo-Mist 500, 5% 
Vapona Insecticide (active ingredient 
was dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate 
(DDVP), and also contained petroleum 
distillates and 1,1,1-trichloethane). 
Chemical remnants may have remained 
present in objects, as well as museum 
cabinets and other furniture used to 
store collections. 
Determinations 
SNOMNH has determined that: 
€The 13 sacred objects described in this notice are specific ceremonial 
objects needed by a traditional Native 
American religious leader for present- 
day adherents to practice traditional 
Native American religion, according to 
the Native American traditional 
knowledge of a lineal descendant, 
Indian Tribe, or Native Hawaiian 
organization. 
€There is a connection between the cultural items described in this notice 
and the Pueblo of Acoma, New Mexico 
and the Pueblo of Laguna, New Mexico.

Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing, at least, 
five individuals have been identified. 
The six associated funerary objects are 
one lot of fauna, one lot of modified 
stone, one lot of unmodified stone, one 
of ceramics, one lot of modified shell, 
and one of wood. In 1869, Reverend 
Edward Osborne (E.O.) Dunning 
removed collections from Brakebill 
Mound (40Kn55) in Knox County, 
Tennessee, near the junction of the 
French Broad and Holston Rivers. The 
collection was purchased and received 
by the Yale Peabody Museum in early 
1870. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
22 individuals have been identified. The 
six associated funerary objects are one 
lot of fauna, one lot of modified stone, 
one lot of unmodified stone, one lot of 
ceramics, one of modified shell, one lot 
of modified shell and bone (fauna). In 
early 1870, Dunning removed 
collections from McBee Mound (40Je10) 
and its immediate vicinity in Jefferson 
County, Tennessee. The collection was 
purchased and received by the Yale 
Peabody Museum in April 1870. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
13 individuals have been identified. The 
five associated funerary objects are one 
lot of fauna, one lot of modified stone, 
one lot of ceramics, one of modified 
shell, one of unmodified shell. Dunning 
removed collections from Lick Creek 
Mound (40Gn2) in Greene County, 
Tennessee, circa 1871–1872. The 
collections were purchased and 
received by the Yale Peabody Museum 
in March 1872. Dunning’s initial 
descriptions of Lick Creek Mound, 
situated at the confluence of the 
Nolichucky River and Lick Creek, 
incorrectly referred to it as Lisles 
Mound. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
four individuals have been identified. 
No associated funerary objects are 
present. Following Dunning’s death in 
March 1874, a portion of his remaining 
archaeological collections, excavated 
between 1869–1872, were donated to 
the Yale Peabody Museum by his wife. 
At least two individuals were attributed 
to an unknown county in Tennessee, 
and at least two individuals were 
attributed to an unknown county in 
Tennessee or North Carolina. 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is clearly identified by the 
information available about the human 
remains and associated funerary objects 
described in this notice. 
Determinations 
The Yale Peabody Museum has 
determined that: 
€The human remains described in this notice represent the physical 
remains of 44 individuals of Native 
American ancestry. 
€The 17 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have 
been placed intentionally with or near 
individual human remains at the time of 
death or later as part of the death rite 
or ceremony. 
€There is a connection between the human remains and associated funerary 
objects described in this notice and the 
Cherokee Nation; Eastern Band of 
Cherokee Indians; The Muscogee 
(Creek) Nation; and the United 
Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in 
Oklahoma.

Abstract of Information Available 
A total of five cultural items have 
been requested for repatriation. 
One lot of sacred objects are bone 
(fauna) implements. In 1869, Reverend 
Edward Osborne (E.O.) Dunning 
removed collections from the farm of 
Adam Brakebill, adjacent to Brakebill 
Mound (40Kn55) in Knox County, 
Tennessee, near the junction of the 
French Broad and Holston Rivers. The 
collection was purchased and received 
by the Yale Peabody Museum in early 
1870. 
One lot of sacred objects are modified 
stone items. In early 1870, Dunning 
removed the objects from Island Bottom, 
a shoal on the Holston River, near 
McBee Mound (40Je10) and in Jefferson 
County, Tennessee. The collection was 
purchased and received by the Yale 
Peabody Museum in April 1870. 
Two sacred objects are one lot of 
modified stone items removed from 
Vance’s Island, and one stone bird effigy 
pipe removed from Howell Farm. 
Dunning described these locales as 
falling within three miles of Strawberry 
Plains, in Knox County, Tennessee. The 
collection was purchased and received 
by the Yale Peabody Museum in April 
1870. 
One sacred object is a ceramic vase. 
Dunning removed the vase from an 
unknown location within Cocke County, 
Tennessee and included it with the 
collections removed from Lick Creek 
Mound (40Gn2). The item was 
purchased and received by the Yale 
Peabody Museum in March 1872.

Abstract of Information Available 
One associated funerary object has 
been identified from site 45AS2 (Steptoe 
Burial) in Asotin County, Washington. 
The associated funerary object is a 
pestle. Burials from this site were likely 
from the late prehistoric period (A.D. 
1500–1700) with other areas of the site 
being used during a much wider 
temporal span. This cultural item was 
likely removed from site 45AS2 during 
excavations in 1972 conducted by the 
University of Idaho under contract with 
the Army Corps of Engineers. Between 
1996 and 2000, the cultural item was 
transferred from the University of Idaho 
to Washington State University. The 
item was recently located in 
unprovenanced archaeological 
collections at Washington State 
University. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified 
from site 45BN15 (Rabbit Island) in 
Benton County, Washington. No 
associated funerary objects are present. 
There are two distinct time periods 
represented at site 45BN15. The earlier 
burials (Rabbit Island I) date to the 
Frenchman-Springs Phase (3500–1500 
BP) while the later burials (Rabbit Island 
II) predate A.D. 1750. This Ancestor is 
currently at Central Washington 
University. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
five individuals have been identified 
from site 45BN55 (Sheep Island) in 
Benton County, Washington. No 
associated funerary objects are present. 
Site 45BN55 was likely utilized during 
the late Pre-Contact to early Historic 
Period. These Ancestors are currently at 
Central Washington University and 
Eastern Washington University. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
two individuals have been identified 
from site 45FR101 (Chiawana) in 
Franklin County, Washington. No 
associated funerary objects are present. 
These Ancestors were likely removed 
from the site during excavations in 
1967. Site 45FR101 was a village site 
with two main temporal components 
including an early component from 
5900–500 BC and a later component 
from A.D. 1000–1870. Excavated 
Ancestors and materials were 
transported to the University of Idaho 
before being transported to Washington 
State University in 2000. One of the 
Ancestors is currently at Washington 
State University while the other was 
recently returned to the University of 
Idaho by a former student. 
Three associated funerary objects 
have been identified from site 45WT002 
(Trestle) in Whitman County, 
Washington. The three associated 
funerary objects are: one modified 
faunal bone, one hawk bell, and one 
pendant. These cultural items were 
removed from the site during contract 
excavations conducted in 1963. Site 
45WT002 has been described as having 
two temporal components with the early 
site use spanning 6700–2500 BP and the 
later component being historic (mid- 
1800s-1900s). The excavated materials 
were then split between Washington 
State University and University of Idaho 
prior to being consolidated at 
Washington State University where 
these cultural items still remain. 
One associated funerary object has 
been identified from site 45WW6 in 
Walla Walla County, Washington. The 
associated funerary object is one tubular 
copper bead. This cultural item was 
likely removed from the site during 
excavations in 1951 by the Smithsonian 
River Basin Survey. Site 45WW6 was 
likely utilized from 700 BP through A.D. 
1857. This cultural item is currently at 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Walla 
Walla District Office. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified 
from an Unknown Site in Washington. 
The 36 associated funerary objects are: 
one abalone shell with serrated edge, 
two lots of copper beads, one lot of 
dentalium bead fragments, one lot of 
glass beads, one lot of glass seed beads, 
two buckles, two lots of buttons, one 
cloth fragment with copper beads, one 
cloth fragment with leather and wood, 
one glass disk, one metal disk, one 
copper fork, one lot of faunal tooth 
fragments, one lot of metal fragments, 
one leather fragment with white beads, 
one lot of lithic materials, one large 
metal hook, one piece of rusted metal, 
one small porcelain dish, one fragment 
of ribbon, two lots of shoe fragments, 
one large copper spoon, one copper 
tube, one piece of coated wire, and one 
piece of wood. The Ancestor and 
cultural items were located within 
Walla Walla District archaeological 
collections from site 45WT39 at 
Washington State University, but did 
not have associated catalog, site, or 
provenience information. This Ancestor 
and cultural items likely originated from 
Palus Cemetery (45FR36), but ultimately 
their provenience could not be 
confirmed by the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers. 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is clearly identified by the 
information available about the human 
remains and associated funerary objects 
described in this notice. 
Determinations

Walla Walla District has determined 
that: 
€The human remains described in this notice represent the physical 
remains of nine individuals of Native 
American ancestry. 
€The 41 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have 
been placed intentionally with or near 
individual human remains at the time of 
death or later as part of the death rite 
or ceremony. 
€There is a connection between the human remains and associated funerary 
objects described in this notice and the 
Confederated Tribes and Bands of the 
Yakama Nation; Confederated Tribes of 
the Colville Reservation; Confederated 
Tribes of the Umatilla Indian 
Reservation; Confederated Tribes of the

Abstract of Information Available 
A total of six cultural items have been 
requested for repatriation. The six 
sacred objects are hand-held weapons 
made of wood. These objects were given 
to the Museum by an individual donor 
in the 1950s as part of an unexpected 
bequest, and provenance was not 
provided by the late donor. In the early 
20th century, the donor traveled to 
Hawai1i, Samoa, and other Pacific 
Islands during his military service and 
for personal reasons. The six objects 
described in this notice are reasonably 
believed to have been acquired by the 
donor during those tours. The six sacred 
objects have not been tested for the 
presence of hazardous materials; they 
have not been treated with hazardous 
materials in the past twenty years. 
Determinations 
The Museum of Science, Boston, has 
determined that: 
€The six sacred objects described in this notice are specific ceremonial 
objects needed by a traditional Native 
American religious leader for present- 
day adherents to practice traditional 
Native American religion, according to 
the Native American traditional 
knowledge of a lineal descendant, 
Indian Tribe, or Native Hawaiian 
organization.

Abstract of Information Available 
Ancestors representing at least two 
individuals have been identified. There 
are no associated funerary objects 
present. Two ancestors are believed to 
have been removed from Tiburon, Marin 
County, CA. The exact location of the 
ancestors’ burials are unknown 
however, they have been marked with a 
tag marked ‘‘Marin County, Seacliff 
Tiburon.’’ It is not known how these 
ancestors were brought to SF State, at 
what time, or where from. They were 
labeled with tags marked with ‘‘Dr. 
Hirabayashi’’ and ‘‘Jane Schellenberg.’’ 
In 1970, there was an Associate 
Professor of Anthropology at SF State 
named Dr. Hirabayashi. In 1998, Julie 
London determined that these ancestors 
were culturally unidentifiable. New 
consultation with Federated Indians of 
Graton Rancheria has determined these 
items to be reasonably associated with 
their Tribe.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice is published as part of the 
National Park Service’s administrative 
responsibilities under NAGPRA. The 
determinations in this notice are the 
sole responsibility of SDSU, and 
additional information on the 
determinations in this notice, including 
the results of consultation, can be found 
in its inventory or related records. The 
National Park Service is not responsible

Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified. 
The 10 lots of associated funerary 
objects representing approximately 500+ 
associated funerary objects are one lot of 
shell, one lot of lithics, one lot of 
unidentified items, one lot of pollen 
samples, one lot of soil samples, one lot 
of non-human faunal, one lot of fire 
affected rock, one lot of historic items, 
one lot of ground stone, and one lot of 
charcoal. In 1979, SDSU led excavations 
at site CA–SDI–6153 (W–2639; La Fleur) 
located in San Diego County, California, 
during which associated funerary 
objects and the burial of an ancestor 
were uncovered and removed. After 
excavation, the associated funerary 
objects were brought to SDSU’s campus; 
it’s unclear whether any of the 
ancestor’s remains were brought to 
SDSU’s campus at that time as they 
were unaccounted for until 2025. The 
resulting collection was given accession 
number SDSU–0093 (CMP–SDSU–0093) 
and included the then unaccounted for 
ancestor. A notice was published in the 
Federal Register for a portion of the 
associated funerary objects from the 
collection on October 24, 2000 (65 FR 
63621); the associated funerary objects 
were listed as cultural items in the 
notice and were repatriated to the Tribes 
listed in the determinations section 
below in 2000. Additional associated 
funerary objects from the collection 
were not part of the repatriation in 2000 
and remained in SDSU’s custody; the 
remains of the ancestor were returned to 
SDSU in 2025. It is unknown whether 
any potentially hazardous substances 
were used to treat the associated 
funerary objects. A portion of the 
ancestral remains are documented as 
being partially soaked with ‘‘Elmer’s 
Glue-All’’ and partially mended with 
‘‘Scotch Super Strength Adhesive.’’ 
Human remains representing, at least, 
54 individuals have been identified. The 
15 lots of associated funerary objects 
representing approximately 180,000+ 
associated funerary objects are one lot of 
ground stone, one lot of historic items, 
one lot of worked non-human faunal, 
one lot of non-human faunal, one lot of 
ceramics, one lot of lithics, one lot of 
non-cultural items, one lot of fire 
affected rock, one lot of charcoal, one lot 
of unworked shell, one lot of worked 
shell, one lot of ochre, one lot of 
unmodified stone, one lot of soil, and 
one lot of seeds. The associated funerary 
objects and ancestral remains were 
removed from site CA–SDI–4638 (W– 
389; Bancroft Ranch) located in San 
Diego County, California during SDSU 
led excavations between 1970 and 1977. 
In 1980, the resulting collection was 
deeded to SDSU and was accessioned as 
SDSU–0094 (CMP–SDSU–0094). A 
notice of inventory completion was 
published in the Federal Register on 
October 24, 2000 (65 FR 63622) 
accounting for a minimum of one 
individual and two associated funerary 
objects, which were repatriated in 2001 
to the Tribes listed in the 
determinations section below. The rest 
of the collection remained in SDSU’s 
custody. It is unknown whether any 
potentially hazardous substances were 
used to treat the human remains or 
associated funerary objects. 
No human remains are present. The 
seven lots of associated funerary objects 
representing approximately 700+ 
associated funerary objects are one lot of 
worked non-human faunal, one lot of 
lithics, one lot of ground stone, one lot 
of ceramics, one lot of unworked non- 
human faunal, one lot of unworked 
shell, and one lot of worked shell. 
Associated funerary objects and human 
remains were collected by Lt. Wayne O. 
Morris on an unknown date from an 
unrecorded site referenced as near the 
Carlton Hills Estates located in San 
Diego County, California; the collection 
was then donated to SDSU in 1965 and 
accessioned as SDSU–0102 (CMP– 
SDSU–0102). Previous repatriation of 
human remains from the collection 
(representing a minimum of one 
individual) occurred in 2010 to the 
Tribes listed in the determinations 
section below; the human remains were 
published in the Federal Register on 
July 18, 2003 (68 FR 42757). The rest of 
the collection remained in SDSU’s 
custody. It is unknown whether any 
potentially hazardous substances were 
used to treat the human remains or 
associated funerary objects. 
No human remains are present. The 
three lots of associated funerary objects 
representing approximately 200+ 
associated funerary objects are one lot of 
ceramics, one lot of lithics, and one lot 
of ground stone. At an unknown date, 
associated funerary objects and human 
remains were removed from site CA– 
IMP–2 located in Imperial County, 
California by an individual identified as 
Wakefield; SDSU subsequently received 
the collection in 1959 and assigned 
accession number SDSU–0172 (CMP– 
SDSU–0172). Previous repatriation of 
the human remains from the collection 
(representing a minimum of one 
individual) occurred in 2001 to the 
Tribes listed in the determinations 
section below; the human remains were 
published in the Federal Register on 
October 24, 2000 (65 FR 63622). The 
rest of the collection remained in 
SDSU’s custody. It is unknown whether 
any potentially hazardous substances 
were used to treat the human remains or 
associated funerary objects. 
No human remains are present. The 
five lots of associated funerary objects 
representing approximately 400+ 
associated funerary objects are one lot of 
unworked shell, one lot of historic 
items, one lot of ground stone, one lot 
of chipped stone, and one lot of soil 
samples. In 1980, associated funerary 
items were removed via surface 
collection and excavation at site CA– 
SDI–215 (Seaside Solana) located in San 
Diego County, California by cultural 
resource management firm RECON. 
SDSU subsequently received the 
collection from RECON in 1984 and 
assigned accession number SDSU–0202 
(CMP–SDSU–0202). It is unknown 
whether any potentially hazardous 
substances were used to treat the human 
remains or associated funerary objects. 
No human remains are present. The 
seven lots of associated funerary objects 
representing approximately 8,800+ 
associated funerary objects are one lot of 
lithics, one lot of soil samples, one lot 
of ground stone, one lot of historic 
items, one lot of unworked non-human 
faunal, one lot of unworked shell, and 
one lot of vegetal samples. In 1978, 
cultural items and human remains were 
removed via excavation from site CA–

1979, SDSU led excavations at site CA– 
SDI–6153 (W–2639; La Fleur) located in 
San Diego County, California during 
which associated funerary objects and 
human remains were removed. After 
excavation, the associated funerary 
objects and ancestral remains were 
brought to SDSU’s campus. The 
majority of the cultural items and the 
ancestral remains were accessioned as 
collection SDSU–0093 (CMP–SDSU– 
0093), for which a notice was published 
in the Federal Register on October 24, 
2000 for a portion of the associated 
funerary objects from the collection (65 
FR 63621); repatriation of these 
associated funerary objects occurred in 
2001 to the Tribes listed in the 
determinations section below. While 
housed at SDSU, for unknown reasons 
at an unknown time, a portion of the 
collection was separated and 
unaccounted for until 2013; the 
portioned-out collection was assigned 
accession number SDSU–0862 (CMP– 
SDSU–0862). It is unknown whether 
any potentially hazardous substances 
were used to treat the human remains or 
associated funerary objects.

collection consists of over 770 bone 
fragments, representing a minimum of 
17 individuals ranging in age from 
infants to older adults. The fragmentary 
nature of the collection makes detailed 
age and sex assessments by individual 
difficult. No known individuals were 
identified from the excavated or 
otherwise obtained remains.

2025). 
On April 18, 2025, the ALJ issued an 
order requiring the remaining 
respondents in the investigation to show 
cause why they should not be found in 
default. Order No. 9 (Apr. 18, 2025). 
Respondent Pacifico filed an answer to 
the Complaint on May 1, 2025, and the 
investigation was subsequently 
terminated with respect to Pacifico 
based on a consent order. Order No. 10 
(May 23, 2025), unreviewed by Comm’n 
Notice (June 17, 2025). The 
investigation was also terminated with 
respect to respondent Salfe based on a 
consent order. Order No. 12 (June 25, 
2025), unreviewed by Comm’n Notice (July 14, 2025). The remaining four 
respondents did not file any response to 
the complaint and notice of 
investigation or to the order to show 
cause for failure to do so. 
On July 21, 2025, Complainants filed 
a motion for summary determination of 
violation, and on July 22, 2025, 
Complainants filed a motion for leave 
for acceptance of a corrected motion for 
summary determination, which was 
granted pursuant to Order No. 15 (July 
22, 2025). On August 4, 2025, OUII filed 
a response in support of Complainants’ 
motion. 
On September 10, 2025, the ALJ 
issued the subject ID granting the 
motion for summary determination, 
which included a recommended 
determination on remedy and bonding. 
No petitions for review of the ID were 
filed. 
Having reviewed the record of the 
investigation, including the ID, the 
pleadings, and the parties’ briefing on 
summary determination, the 
Commission has determined to review 
the ID in part. Specifically, the 
Commission has determined to review 
the ID’s findings with respect to the 
economic prong of the domestic 
industry requirement. The Commission 
has determined not to review the other 
findings in the ID. 
In connection with its review, the 
Commission requests responses to the 
following question: 
Question 1: On or before the date of the 
complaint, explain how and to what extent 
the investments relating to the Texas 
manufacturing facility were with respect to 
the protected domestic industry articles as 
required under section 337(a)(2). Please 
provide citation to any evidence in the record 
that would support this. If such investments 
were not exclusively with respect to the 
protected domestic industry articles, explain 
how the asserted domestic investments for 
the facility can be allocated with respect to 
the protected domestic industry articles. 
The parties are requested to brief their 
positions with reference to the 
applicable law and the existing 
evidentiary record. 
In connection with the final 
disposition of this investigation, the 
statute authorizes issuance of, inter alia, 
(1) an exclusion order that could result 
in the exclusion of the subject articles 
from entry into the United States; and/ 
or (2) cease and desist orders that could 
result in the respondents being required 
to cease and desist from engaging in 
unfair acts in the importation and sale 
of such articles. Accordingly, the 
Commission is interested in receiving 
written submissions that address the 
form of remedy, if any, that should be 
ordered. If a party seeks exclusion of an 
article from entry into the United States 
for purposes other than entry for 
consumption, the party should so 
indicate and provide information 
establishing that activities involving 
other types of entry either are adversely 
affecting it or likely to do so. For 
background, see Certain Devices for 
Connecting Computers via Telephone 
Lines, Inv. No. 337–TA–360, USITC Pub. No. 2843, Comm’n Op. at 7–10 
(Dec. 1994). 
In connection with its remedy 
determination, the Commission requests 
responses to the following question: 
Question 2: Identify evidence or allegations 
that the foreign defaulting respondents 
maintain commercially significant 
inventories and/or engage in significant 
commercial operations in the United States. 
The parties are requested to brief their 
positions with reference to the 
applicable law and the existing 
evidentiary record. 
The statute requires the Commission 
to consider the effects of that remedy 
upon the public interest. The public 
interest factors the Commission will 
consider include the effect that an 
exclusion order and cease and desist 
orders would have on: (1) the public 
health and welfare, (2) competitive 
conditions in the U.S. economy, (3) U.S. 
production of articles that are like or 
directly competitive with those that are 
subject to investigation, and (4) U.S. 
consumers. The Commission is 
therefore interested in receiving written 
submissions that address the 
aforementioned public interest factors 
in the context of this investigation. 
If the Commission orders some form 
of remedy, the U.S. Trade 
Representative, as delegated by the 
President, has 60 days to approve, 
disapprove, or take no action on the 
Commission’s determination. See 
Presidential Memorandum of July 21, 
2005, 70 FR 43251 (July 26, 2005). 
During this period, the subject articles 
would be entitled to enter the United 
States under bond, in an amount 
determined by the Commission and 
prescribed by the Secretary of the 
Treasury. The Commission is therefore 
interested in receiving submissions 
concerning the amount of the bond that 
should be imposed if a remedy is 
ordered. 
Written Submissions: Parties are 
requested to file written responses to the 
briefing questions above. Parties to the 
investigation, interested government 
agencies, and any other interested 
parties are encouraged to file written 
submissions on the issues of remedy, 
the public interest, and bonding. Such 
submissions should address the 
recommended determination by the ALJ 
on remedy and bonding. 
In their initial submission, 
Complainants are also requested to 
identify the remedy sought and 
Complainants and OUII are requested to 
submit proposed remedial orders for the 
Commission’s consideration. 
Complainants are further requested to 
provide the HTSUS subheadings under 
which the accused products are 
imported, and to supply the 
identification information for all known 
importers of the products at issue in this 
investigation. All initial written 
submissions, from the parties and/or 
third parties/interested government 
agencies, and proposed remedial orders 
from the parties must be filed no later 
than close of business on January 5,

Case No.: 1:25–cv–04235–ABJ 
COMPLAINT 
Constellation Energy Corporation 
(‘‘Constellation’’) seeks to buy one of its 
largest rivals, Calpine Corporation 
(‘‘Calpine’’), in a proposed acquisition 
that would create the largest wholesale 
power generator in the United States 
with a formidable array of assets. The 
combination of those assets would risk 
affording Constellation the opportunity 
to profitably raise the price of electricity 
for millions of citizens and businesses 
in Texas and parts of the mid-Atlantic, 
likely resulting in increased energy 
costs of more than $100 million per 
year. The United States and the State of 
Texas bring this suit to preserve 
competition. 
I. Introduction 
1. Electricity is an essential resource 
to people and companies across the 
country. 
Whether storing food in refrigerators, 
keeping the lights on in workplaces, 
watching a football game, or powering 
lifesaving support systems in hospitals, 
Americans depend on electricity for 
almost every facet of their daily lives. 
Demand for electricity is increasing 
rapidly, as the population grows and 
innovative technologies like cloud 
computing and artificial intelligence 
rely ever more on energy-intensive data 
centers. In Texas, the highest level of 
electricity consumption (so-called ‘‘peak 
load’’) handled by its largest electrical 
grid is expected to increase by 72% 
from 2024 to 2030. In the multistate 
power grid that includes the mid- 
Atlantic, summer peak load is expected 
to increase by 3.1% per year over the 
next decade. Despite this rapidly 
increasing demand, it is challenging to

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159206 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices add new reliable generation to the 
nation’s power grids. 
2. Consumers and businesses demand 
instantaneous access to electricity to 
avoid disruption to their lives and work. 
Demand for electricity changes 
depending on weather and patterns of 
social and business activity that vary 
with the time of day, day of week, and 
season of year. For example, peak 
demand may be reached during the 
hottest summer days or coldest winter 
nights, when air conditioning or electric 
heating are most needed. Lower demand 
may occur on some weekends or major 
holidays when many businesses are 
closed. Electricity must be produced 
and delivered in line with this 
fluctuating demand, and electrical grid 
operators call upon power generators 
like Constellation and Calpine to turn 
power generation plants on or shut them 
off to balance the supply of electricity 
with demand. 
3. To determine which plants should 
be turned on or shut off, and how much 
electricity each plant should produce, 
the grid operator conducts daily and 
intra-day auctions. These electricity 
auctions set the prices paid to every 
generation unit. Constellation and 
Calpine compete against each other and 
against other generators in these 
auctions by submitting offers from each 
of their individual generation units to 
produce certain amounts of electricity at 
certain times and prices to meet 
demand. The offers of individual 
generation units are accepted from 
lowest to highest price until the total 
amount of electricity from the 
generation units combined satisfies the 
demand for a particular period. The 
price for the last unit’s offer necessary 
to meet real-time demand, referred to as 
the market-clearing price, sets the price 
paid at that auction for every other 
individual unit that has received an 
accepted offer. 
4. In other words, the price of 
electricity is set by the highest price 
offered by the individual power 
generating unit whose offer is accepted. 
All other generating units with lower 
offers that had offers accepted receive 
the same market-clearing price for the 
electricity they produce within a given 
period, despite having offered lower 
prices. Because the same price is paid 
by all wholesale electricity customers, 
even small price increases driven by one 
generator’s offer strategy, executed 
during specific times throughout the 
year, can lead to market-wide price 
increases, adding tens or even hundreds 
of millions of dollars annually in 
increased electricity bills for consumers 
and businesses. 
5. On January 10, 2025, Constellation 
announced plans to acquire Calpine for 
a net purchase price of $26.6 billion (the 
‘‘Acquisition’’). If allowed to proceed, 
the Acquisition would create the largest 
wholesale electricity generating 
company in the United States. 
6. Constellation and Calpine each sell 
wholesale electricity to two of the 
nation’s major electricity grids, among 
others. The Electric Reliability Council 
of Texas (‘‘ERCOT’’) encompasses most 
of Texas, and PJM Interconnection LLC 
(‘‘PJM’’) includes all or parts of 
Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, 
Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North 
Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and 
the District of Columbia. 
7. The Acquisition would eliminate 
substantial competition between 
Constellation and Calpine within both 
of these grids by increasing the 
opportunity for the combined firm to 
engage profitably in a strategy that 
withholds output from one of its plants, 
forcing the grid operator to call on a 
higher-cost plant to set the market price. 
Increasing the market-clearing price 
would benefit the combined firm’s 
plants that have had offers accepted, as 
well as all other active plants in the 
market. The aggregation of Constellation 
and Calpine’s portfolios of generation 
capacity within each of these two grids 
confers more opportunities for the 
combined firm to engage profitably in 
anticompetitive withholding that would 
raise wholesale electricity prices within 
those grids. 
8. In short, the Acquisition would 
eliminate competition between 
Constellation and Calpine, thereby 
increasing Constellation’s ability and 
incentive to anticompetitively withhold 
electricity to raise wholesale electricity 
prices beyond what either company 
could do today as independent 
competitors. A successful withholding 
strategy could result in increased retail 
electricity prices paid by tens of 
millions of residential, commercial, and 
industrial customers across Texas and 
the area that includes southeastern 
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, 
and the eastern shores of Maryland and 
Virginia. 
II. The Defendants 
9. Constellation is a Pennsylvania 
corporation headquartered in Baltimore, 
Maryland. Constellation is one of the 
largest competitive electric generation 
companies in the nation, as measured 
by owned and contracted megawatts. 
10. In ERCOT, Constellation owns or 
exercises control over two combined- 
cycle natural gas plants and one steam 
turbine plant. In addition, it has a 44% 
interest in the South Texas Project 
nuclear plant and two wind farms. 
Constellation’s combination of nuclear, 
wind, and natural gas electricity power 
plants collectively have the capacity to 
generate approximately 5,000 megawatts 
(MW) of electricity in Texas. (For 
context, one megawatt serves between 
800 to 1,000 homes.) 
11. In PJM, Constellation owns or 
exercises control over 25 total plants 
and has a partial ownership interest in 
three. This includes combined-cycle 
natural gas plants, nuclear plants, coal 
plants, oil plants, and solar and wind 
renewals. These plants collectively 
provide more than 20,000 MW of 
electric capacity across PJM. 
12. Calpine is a Delaware corporation 
headquartered in Houston, Texas. 
Calpine is the largest generator of 
electricity from natural gas and 
geothermal resources in the United 
States. 
13. In ERCOT, Calpine owns or 
exercises control over 13 combined- 
cycle plants and one combustion 
turbine natural gas plant. In addition, 
Calpine is constructing another 
combustion turbine natural gas plant 
expected to come online in 2026 and 
holds a 28% interest in one additional 
operating combined-cycle natural gas 
plant. Calpine’s power plants 
collectively have the capacity to 
generate approximately 9,000 MW of 
electricity, making it the third-largest 
electricity generation supplier in the 
state. 
14. In PJM, Calpine owns or exercises 
control over 14 total plants, including 
natural gas plants, oil plants, and solar 
facilities. These plants collectively 
provide more than 5,000 MW of electric 
capacity. 
15. CPN CS Holdco Corp. (‘‘Holdco’’) 
is a Delaware corporation headquartered 
in Houston, Texas and a direct wholly 
owned subsidiary of Calpine. Calpine 
created Holdco as a vehicle for its sale 
to Constellation. 
III. How Electricity Is Generated and 
Sold 
A. Wholesale Electricity 
16. Electricity supplied to retail 
customers is produced at power plants. 
Wholesale electricity is electricity that 
is generated for ‘‘sale for resale’’ to 
utilities or retail electric providers that 
in turn resell it to end consumers, such 
as households and businesses. Power 
plants often contain several individual 
generating units that transform energy 
from fuel or a renewable resource into 
electricity. Important generating 
technologies in these units include 
steam turbines, combustion turbines,

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159207 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices and combined-cycle turbines powered 
by natural gas, oil, or coal, as well as 
nuclear reactors, wind turbines, and 
solar panels. 
17. Generating units vary 
considerably in their operating costs, 
which are determined primarily by the 
cost of fuel and how efficiently that fuel 
can be converted into electricity. 
€Renewable units, such as solar farms and wind turbines, have very low 
operating costs, but can operate only 
when the sun is shining or the wind is 
blowing. 
€Baseload units, such as nuclear plants and some coal-fired steam 
turbine units, also have relatively low 
operating costs and provide consistent 
generation throughout the day and 
across each season of the year. Nuclear 
plants are designed to operate at full 
capacity unless they are offline for 
refueling outages. For many coal units, 
it is impractical to turn them on and off 
on a short-term basis because of long 
startup times and mechanical stress 
from cycling the units on and off. 
€Mid-merit units, such as combined- cycle natural gas units and some coal 
steam turbines, can typically be turned 
on or have their output adjusted more 
quickly than baseload units. 
€Peaking units, such as oil- and gas- fired combustion or gas-fired steam 
turbine units, tend to run only during 
periods of high (or ‘‘peak’’) electricity 
demand. They typically have the 
highest operating costs of any 
generation units but are also the easiest 
to turn on and shut off. This makes 
them critical for balancing supply and 
demand to keep the lights on without 
overloading the system. 
18. Electricity generated at a plant is 
transported via an extensive set of 
interconnected high voltage lines and 
equipment, known as the transmission 
grid, to lower voltage distribution lines 
that relay electricity to homes and 
businesses. Transmission grid operators 
closely monitor the grid to prevent too 
little or too much electricity from 
flowing over the grid, either of which 
can risk widespread blackouts through 
damage to the lines, equipment, or 
generating units connected to the grid. 
To avoid damage and service 
interruptions, grid operators manage a 
grid to prevent additional electricity 
from flowing over a transmission line as 
that line approaches its operating limit 
(a ‘‘transmission constraint’’). 
B. The Electric Reliability Council of 
Texas 
19. ERCOT is an independent system 
operator that serves as the electricity 
grid and market operator for most of 
Texas. This means it manages the 
purchase of wholesale electricity from 
Constellation, Calpine, and their 
competitors, as well as the resale and 
transmission of that electricity to 
utilities and retail electric providers that 
directly serve end customers. 
20. ERCOT is a membership-based 
nonprofit corporation subject to 
oversight by the Public Utility 
Commission of Texas. Its members 
include consumers, cooperatives, 
generators, power marketers, retail 
electricity providers, investor-owned 
electric utilities, transmission and 
distribution providers, and municipally 
owned electric utilities. 
C. PJM Interconnection 
21. PJM is a regional transmission 
organization that manages the wholesale 
electricity market and transmission grid 
that supplies electricity to all or parts of 
Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, 
Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North 
Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and 
the District of Columbia. 
22. PJM is a private, nonprofit 
organization whose members include 
transmission line owners, generation 
owners, distribution companies, retail 
customers, and retail electricity 
suppliers. 
23. PJM manages the largest 
transmission grid in the United States, 
which provides electricity to more than 
67 million people. Each year, PJM is 
responsible for overseeing more than 
$25 billion in wholesale electricity 
sales. 
D. ERCOT and PJM Use Auctions To Set 
the Price of Electricity 
24. ERCOT and PJM each oversee two 
auctions to set the price of wholesale 
electricity and ensure there is enough 
supply to meet demand in their 
respective parts of the country. The first 
is a ‘‘day-ahead’’ auction that sets 
hourly prices for the next day, and the 
second is a ‘‘real-time’’ auction that sets 
prices for each five-minute interval 
throughout the operating day to reflect 
changing demand for electricity at 
specific times. In both auctions, 
competing generators, including 
Constellation and Calpine, submit offers 
for each of their generation units to sell 
electricity to electricity retailers at a 
specific price. These offers are the 
primary means by which electricity 
generators compete to supply electricity 
in ERCOT and PJM and drive the price 
consumers ultimately pay for it. 
25. In the day-ahead auctions, each 
buyer typically submits a bid to ERCOT 
or PJM that identifies the amount of 
electricity that the buyer expects to need 
for each hour of the next day. ERCOT 
or PJM then adds up the bids to 
determine how much total electricity is 
expected to be demanded by buyers 
each hour. Each generator offering 
electricity in the day-ahead market 
(such as Constellation and Calpine) 
submits an offer to sell electricity to 
ERCOT or PJM that indicates, for each 
generating unit, the amount of 
electricity it is willing to sell the next 
day and the price at which it is willing 
to sell. 
26. Subject to the physical limitations 
of their transmission grids, ERCOT and 
PJM seek to ‘‘dispatch’’ generating units, 
that is, to call on them to generate 
electricity in ‘‘merit’’ order, meaning 
from lowest offer price to highest. In the 
day-ahead auction, subject to expected 
transmission constraints, ERCOT and 
PJM take the least expensive offer first 
and then accept offers at progressively 
higher prices until the needs for each 
hour of the next day are covered. This 
minimizes the total cost of generating 
the electricity required for the next day. 
The clearing price for any given hour is 
determined by the generating unit with 
the highest offer price that is needed for 
that hour. All other sellers for that hour 
receive that identical price regardless of 
the individual unit’s own offer price or 
costs. So, a generating unit that offers a 
lower price to ERCOT or PJM is paid the 
higher clearing price if electricity from 
additional, higher-priced generating 
units is needed to meet demand. 
27. The real-time auctions reconcile 
the outcome of the day-ahead auctions 
with actual supply and demand. ERCOT 
and PJM follow the same auction 
mechanism as in the day-ahead 
auctions, by accepting sellers’ offers in 
merit order, subject to the physical and/ 
engineering limitations of the 
transmission grid, until there is enough 
electricity to meet actual demand. In the 
real-time auctions, however, ERCOT 
and PJM set prices for each five-minute 
interval of the day. 
28. Transmission constraints 
sometimes affect PJM’s merit order. 
When the lowest- cost generation cannot 
be dispatched because it would 
overload a transmission constraint, it is 
called ‘‘congestion.’’ To avoid 
congestion while still satisfying 
demand, PJM must call on higher-priced 
units that, given their location on the 
grid, do not overload transmission 
constraints. When this happens, prices 
are lower on one side of the constraint 
and higher on the other side. In other 
words, when the capacity of the 
transmission lines connecting two 
regions within PJM is reached so that 
electricity cannot flow from one region 
to another, the demand within each 
region has to be met by electricity that 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:49 Dec 17, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00119 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\18DEN1.SGM 18DEN1
lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159208 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices is generated within that region. In these 
situations, competition and thus pricing 
can be different across the different 
regions within PJM. 
IV. The Relevant Markets for 
Evaluating the Proposed Acquisition 
A. Wholesale Electricity Is a Relevant 
Product Market 
29. Wholesale electricity is a relevant 
product market for evaluating the 
potential competitive impact of the 
Acquisition. And each hourly increment 
in which wholesale electricity is sold in 
ERCOT’s or PJM’s ‘‘day-ahead’’ auction, 
as well as each five-minute increment in 
the ERCOT or PJM ‘‘real-time’’ auctions, 
constitutes a separate relevant product 
market. This is because electricity 
available in one time period is not a 
substitute for electricity available in 
another time period (notwithstanding 
the ability to use batteries to some 
extent to transfer electricity from one 
time period to another). While supply 
and demand for wholesale electricity 
can vary in different periods, both 
auctions share a common feature: in the 
event of a small but significant non- 
transitory increase in the price of 
wholesale electricity at relevant times, 
not enough purchasers are likely to 
switch away from wholesale electricity 
to make that increase unprofitable. 
Additionally, in the event of a small but 
significant non-transitory increase in the 
price of wholesale electricity within an 
hourly or five-minute interval, not 
enough purchasers would switch to 
consuming wholesale electricity in a 
different time period to make that price 
increase unprofitable. This means that 
each of these specific auction time 
intervals markets is a relevant product 
market and a ‘‘line of commerce’’ within 
the meaning of Section 7 of the Clayton 
Act. 
30. While each of these specific time 
intervals is a relevant product market, 
they can be aggregated into a ‘‘cluster 
market’’ for analytical convenience for 
considering whether the Acquisition 
violates the antitrust laws. For example, 
all 24 hours in a single day in either PJM 
or ERCOT’s ‘‘day-ahead’’ auction could 
be aggregated into one market, as could 
all five-minute intervals in a single hour 
in PJM or ERCOT’s ‘‘real-time’’ auction. 
Separate cluster markets could also be 
created for periods of time that exhibit 
similar market contexts and competitive 
dynamics—for example, summer 
afternoons or winter nights. 
B. ERCOT Is a Relevant Geographic 
Market 
31. The region covered by ERCOT is 
a relevant geographic market for 
evaluating the potential competitive 
impact of Constellation’s purchase of 
Calpine and a ‘‘section of the country’’ 
within the meaning of Section 7 of the 
Clayton Act. ERCOT serves more than 
27 million Texans, who collectively 
account for about 90% of the state’s 
electricity demand. In 2024, ERCOT was 
responsible for overseeing the sale of 
more than $14.4 billion in wholesale 
electricity. 
32. In the event of a small but 
significant non-transitory increase in the 
price of wholesale electricity within 
ERCOT, not enough purchasers in the 
ERCOT region are likely to switch to 
purchasing from regions outside ERCOT 
to make that increase unprofitable. At 
its annual peak, electricity demand in 
ERCOT exceeds 85,000 MW. ERCOT’s 
connections to Mexico’s grid and to the 
Southwest Power Pool grid, which 
collectively can allow about 1,200 MW 
of electricity to flow into ERCOT, are 
insufficient to prevent generators from 
imposing a small but significant non- 
transitory price increase within ERCOT. 
C. PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic Is a 
Relevant Geographic Market 
33. The PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic 
geographic area is a relevant geographic 
market for evaluating the potential 
competitive impact of Constellation’s 
purchase of Calpine and a ‘‘section of 
the country’’ within the meaning of 
Section 7 of the Clayton Act. The PJM 
Coastal Mid-Atlantic geographic area is 
a distinct area within the PJM region 
that includes southeastern 
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, 
and the eastern shores of Maryland and 
Virginia. In 2024, approximately $4 
billion of wholesale electricity was 
generated and supplied to more than 10 
million people and businesses in PJM 
Coastal Mid-Atlantic. 
34. PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic is 
affected by a major transmission 
constraint located near the Maryland- 
Pennsylvania border, called 
Nottingham, that divides PJM Coastal 
Mid-Atlantic from the rest of the PJM 
region. Generators within PJM Coastal 
Mid-Atlantic frequently sell electricity 
into other areas to the west and south. 
But when transmission lines are 
constrained, the amount of electricity 
that generators within PJM Coastal Mid- 
Atlantic can sell outside of the area is 
limited. As a result, electricity prices in 
PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic often differ 
from prices in other areas within the 
PJM region. 
35. When Nottingham is constrained, 
purchasers of wholesale electricity for 
use in PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic have 
limited ability to turn to generation 
originating outside of PJM Coastal Mid- 
Atlantic. During these times, the amount 
of electricity that purchasers could 
obtain from generators outside PJM 
Coastal Mid-Atlantic is insufficient to 
deter generators located in PJM Coastal 
Mid-Atlantic from imposing a small but 
significant non-transitory price increase. 
V. The Acquisition Is Reasonably 
Likely To Raise Electricity Prices 
36. The combination of Constellation 
and Calpine’s electricity generating 
units serving ERCOT and PJM Coastal 
Mid-Atlantic would eliminate 
competition between them and enhance 
Constellation’s post-Acquisition ability 
and incentive to withhold electricity to 
raise wholesale electricity price 
anticompetitively in those markets. 
A. Constellation’s Ability and Incentive 
To Raise Wholesale Electricity Price in 
ERCOT 
37. The Acquisition would increase 
opportunities for Constellation to 
profitably engage in a withholding 
strategy that would increase wholesale 
electricity prices in Texas. The 
Acquisition would almost triple 
Constellation’s generation capacity to 
nearly 14,000 MW in ERCOT and add to 
its Texas portfolio a fleet of gas plants 
that have relatively higher operating 
costs than Constellation’s current fleet. 
Constellation has three gas plants—one 
steam turbine plant and two combined- 
cycle plants—that total approximately 
3,500 MW. It also has a 44% share in 
a nuclear plant with a capacity of 
approximately 2,600 MW and owns two 
small wind generating assets that 
collectively have about 170 MW of 
capacity. Calpine owns or controls 13 
combined-cycle gas plants in ERCOT 
and has a minority share in a fourteenth 
plant that together have 9,000 MW of 
capacity. 
38. The Acquisition would make 
Constellation the second-largest electric 
generation company in Texas, 
controlling more than 12% of ERCOT’s 
generating capacity and over 20% of the 
natural gas generation capacity in 
ERCOT that often sets the clearing price. 
This portfolio of gas generation plants 
represents the ‘‘marginal fuel’’: natural 
gas sets the price for all customers in 
ERCOT the majority of the time, and is 
particularly valuable in ERCOT, where 
the electricity grid relies on gas to 
complement and support its increasing 
use of intermittent renewable resources 
such as sun and wind to generate 
electricity. 
39. The Acquisition would give 
Constellation a broader portfolio of 
assets that can be turned on and shut off 
more readily and quickly would enable 
it to more frequently and more 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:49 Dec 17, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00120 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\18DEN1.SGM 18DEN1
lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159209 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices strategically withhold electricity at 
lower opportunity costs in order to 
enjoy increased market prices on the 
other generation units it continues to 
operate. By withholding a unit—or 
combination of units—from ERCOT’s 
‘‘day-ahead’’ or ‘‘real-time’’ auctions, 
Constellation could force ERCOT to 
accept an offer from a higher-priced 
unit. This would in turn raise the 
market-wide price to the benefit of 
Constellation’s other units. The 
additional revenues received by 
Constellation’s lower-cost generating 
unit(s) because of anticompetitively 
higher market-wide prices would 
frequently more than compensate for the 
lost profits from the generating unit(s) 
withheld. In other words, after the 
Acquisition, Constellation would be in 
a better position than either it or 
Calpine are today as independent 
competitors to profit from withholding 
output and raising the market-wide 
price to anticompetitive levels. 
40. Because every other generation 
unit needed to meet demand in ERCOT 
would also receive the 
anticompetitively higher market-wide 
prices, the market-wide harm is much 
greater than simply Constellation’s 
increased profits and the harm would be 
felt across the entire region. A small 
price increase that results in only 
millions in profit to Constellation could 
result in more than $100 million in 
harm to Texas consumers. 
B. Constellation’s Ability and Incentive 
To Raise Wholesale Electricity Price in 
PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic 
41. The Acquisition would enhance 
Constellation’s ability to withhold 
output and raise the wholesale 
electricity price in PJM Coastal Mid- 
Atlantic by increasing its ownership of 
mid-merit and peaking units, which can 
be turned on or shut off more quickly 
than other types of generation assets. 
The Acquisition would enable 
Constellation to more frequently and 
more strategically withhold generation 
capacity at lower opportunity costs. 
42. Constellation can withhold 
capacity in several ways, such as by 
submitting high offers in the PJM 
auctions for some of the capacity from 
its higher-cost units so that they are not 
called on to produce electricity. By 
withholding capacity from a unit—or 
combination of units—from PJM’s ‘‘day- 
ahead’’ or ‘‘real-time’’ auction, 
Constellation could force PJM to accept 
an offer from a higher-priced unit in 
order to meet demand. This would raise 
the price in PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic to 
the benefit of Constellation’s other units 
supplying power to this area. 
43. The additional revenues received 
by Constellation’s lower-cost generation 
units, including its nuclear plants, 
because of anticompetitively higher 
prices in PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic 
would more than compensate for the 
lost profits from the generating unit(s) 
withheld. In other words, after the 
Acquisition, Constellation would be in 
a better position than either it or 
Calpine is today as an independent 
competitor to profit from reducing 
output and raising the wholesale 
electricity price in PJM Coastal Mid- 
Atlantic. 
44. Increasing Constellation’s 
incentive and ability to profitably 
withhold capacity for PJM Coastal Mid- 
Atlantic increases the likelihood that 
Constellation will exercise market 
power after its acquisition of Calpine. 
VI. Potential Entry Would Not Offset 
Anticompetitive Effects 
45. Entry into wholesale electricity 
markets by building new generation 
capacity in either ERCOT or PJM Coastal 
Mid-Atlantic requires significant capital 
investment in generating equipment, 
infrastructure, and technology, and 
generally takes many years, considering 
the necessary environmental, safety, 
zoning, and regulatory approvals. 
46. In both ERCOT and PJM Coastal 
Mid-Atlantic, recent supply chain 
dynamics and rising inflation have 
made it more difficult and expensive for 
companies to procure transformers and 
turbines to build gas-fired generation 
plants. Furthermore, the anticipated 
increase in electricity demand (e.g., to power AI data centers as well as 
population growth and increased 
economic activity) has led to long 
queues for the delivery of new gas 
turbines, so that new entry is unlikely 
to be timely. 
47. In PJM, interconnection queue 
wait times, or the duration from initial 
connection request to commercial 
operations, have increased substantially 
since the early 2000s. Building new 
high-voltage transmission that would 
relieve the constraints that limit the 
flow of electricity out of PJM Coastal 
Mid-Atlantic would also generally take 
many years, and require significant 
capital investment and multiple 
environmental, safety, zoning, and 
regulatory approvals. 
48. Entry into wholesale electricity 
markets in ERCOT and PJM Coastal 
Mid-Atlantic would not be timely, 
likely, or sufficient in magnitude, 
character, or scope to defeat an 
anticompetitive price increase resulting 
from the Acquisition. 
49. To the extent that there is new 
entry, including entry from renewable 
generation units, it will likely lag 
behind the substantial increases in 
demand projected in ERCOT and PJM 
Coastal Mid-Atlantic. 
50. Defendants also cannot 
demonstrate verifiable, merger-specific 
efficiencies sufficient to offset the 
Acquisition’s anticompetitive effects. 
VII. Jurisdiction and Venue 
51. The United States brings this 
action pursuant to Section 15 of the 
Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 25, 
to prevent and restrain Defendants from 
violating Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 
15 U.S.C. 18. 
52. The State of Texas brings this 
action under Section 16 of the Clayton 
Act, 15 U.S.C. 26, as parens patriae on 
behalf of and to protect its general 
economy and the health and welfare of 
its residents and to prevent and restrain 
the violation by Defendants of Section 7 
of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18. 
53. Defendants are engaged in 
interstate commerce and in activities 
substantially affecting interstate 
commerce. The Court has subject-matter 
jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 
Section 15 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 
25, and 28 U.S.C. 1331, 1337(a), and 
1345. 
54. Defendants have consented to 
venue and personal jurisdiction in this 
judicial district. Venue is therefore 
proper in this District under Section 12 
of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 22, and 28 
U.S.C. 1391(c). 
VIII. Violation Alleged 
55. The Acquisition, if it were 
consummated, likely would lessen 
competition substantially for wholesale 
electricity in ERCOT and PJM Coastal 
Mid-Atlantic, in violation of Section 7 
of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18. 
56. Unless restrained, the Acquisition 
likely would have the following 
anticompetitive effects, among others: 
(a) Competition in wholesale 
electricity markets in ERCOT and PJM 
Coastal Mid-Atlantic would be 
substantially lessened; 
(b) Constellation would wield 
increased market power in wholesale 
electricity markets in ERCOT and PJM 
Coastal Mid-Atlantic; and 
(c) Prices for wholesale electricity in 
ERCOT and PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic 
would increase. 
IX. Request for Relief 
57. Plaintiffs request that this Court: 
(a) Adjudge Constellation’s proposed 
acquisition of Calpine to violate Section 
7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18; 
(b) Permanently enjoin and restrain 
Defendants from consummating the 
proposed acquisition of Calpine by

S. ‘‘Transaction’’ means 
Constellation’s acquisition of Calpine 
that is the subject of the ‘‘Agreement

III. Applicability 
A. This Final Judgment applies to 
Constellation, Calpine, and CPN, as 
defined above, and all other persons in 
active concert or participation with any 
Defendant who receive actual notice of 
this Final Judgment. 
B. If, prior to complying with Section 
IV and Section V of this Final Judgment, 
Defendants sell or otherwise dispose of 
all or substantially all of their assets or 
of business units that include 
Divestiture Assets, Defendants must 
require any purchaser to be bound by 
the provisions of this Final Judgment. 
Defendants need not obtain such an 
agreement from Acquirers. 
IV. Divestitures 
A. Defendants are ordered and 
directed to divest the Divestiture Assets 
in a manner consistent with this Final 
Judgment to an Acquirer or Acquirers 
acceptable to the United States, in its 
sole discretion, after consultation with 
Texas. Defendants must enter into a 
definitive contract or contracts for sale 
of the Divestiture Assets within 240 
calendar days after consummation of the 
Transaction. The United States, in its 
sole discretion, may grant up to two 
thirty (30) day extensions of this time 
period, not to exceed sixty (60) calendar 
days in total, and will notify the Court 
in such circumstances. Defendants must 
seek Regulatory Approvals within five 
calendar days after the United States 
provides written notice pursuant to 
Paragraph VI.C. that it does not object to 
the proposed Acquirer or Acquirers. 
Defendants must divest the relevant 
Divestiture Assets no later than thirty 
(30) calendar days after receiving, for all 
of any Acquirer’s Divestiture Assets, the 
last necessary Regulatory Approvals 
required for that Acquirer’s Divestiture 
Assets. The United States, in its sole 
discretion, may grant up to one fifteen 
(15) day extension of this time period, 
and will notify the Court in such 
circumstances. For the avoidance of 
doubt, the deadlines set forth in this 
Paragraph apply independently to each 
set of Divestiture Assets (ERCOT 
Divestiture Assets and PJM Divestiture 
Assets), such that the timing of receipt 
of Regulatory Approvals required for 
divestiture of one set of Divestiture 
Assets does not provide a basis to delay 
the divestiture of the other set of 
Divestiture Assets. For the avoidance of 
doubt, the divestiture of assets to a 
particular Acquirer need only be 
completed once all relevant Regulatory 
Approvals have been received for all 
assets to be divested to that Acquirer. 
B. For all contracts, agreements, and 
customer relationships (or portions of 
such contracts, agreements, and 
customer relationships) included in the 
Divestiture Assets, Defendants must 
assign or otherwise transfer all 
contracts, agreements, and customer 
relationships to Acquirer or Acquirers 
within the deadlines for divestiture set 
forth in Paragraph IV.A; provided, 
however, that for any contract or agreement that requires the consent of 
another party to assign or otherwise 
transfer, Defendants must use best 
efforts to accomplish the assignment or 
transfer but it may not be a violation of 
this Final Judgment to fail to obtain the 
required consents. Defendants must not 
interfere with any negotiations between 
an Acquirer and a contracting party. 
C. Defendants must use best efforts to 
divest the Divestiture Assets as 
expeditiously as possible. Defendants 
must take no action that would 
jeopardize the completion of the 
divestitures ordered by the Court, 
including any action to impede the 
permitting, operation, or divestiture of 
the Divestiture Assets. 
D. Unless the United States otherwise 
consents in writing, the divestitures 
pursuant to this Final Judgment must 
include the entire Divestiture Assets 
and must be accomplished in such a 
way as to satisfy the United States, in its 
sole discretion, after consultation with 
Texas, that the Divestiture Assets can 
and will be used by Acquirer or 
Acquirers as part of a viable, ongoing 
business of electric generation services 
and that divestiture to Acquirer or 
Acquirers will remedy the competitive 
harm alleged in the Complaint. 
E. The divestitures must be made to 
one or more Acquirers that, in the 
United States’ sole judgment, after 
consultation with Texas, have the intent 
and capability, including the necessary 
managerial, operational, technical, and 
financial capability, to compete

provision of electric generation services. 
F. The divestitures must be 
accomplished in a manner that satisfies 
the United States, in its sole discretion, 
after consultation with Texas, that none 
of the terms of any agreement between 
an Acquirer and Defendants give 
Defendants the ability unreasonably to 
raise an Acquirer’s costs, to lower an 
Acquirer’s efficiency, or otherwise 
interfere in the ability of an Acquirer to 
compete effectively in the provision of 
electric generation services. 
G. Divestiture of the Divestiture 
Assets may be made to one or more 
Acquirers, provided that it is 
demonstrated to the sole satisfaction of 
the United States, after consultation 
with Texas, that the criteria required by 
Paragraphs IV.D., IV.E., and IV.F. will 
still be met. 
H. In accomplishing the divestitures 
ordered by this Final Judgment, 
Defendants promptly must make 
known, by usual and customary means, 
the availability of the Divestiture Assets, 
except that, for Calpine’s interest in the 
Gregory Power Plant, such notice of 
availability will be subject to any third- 
party rights under the existing 
partnership agreements relating to the 
Gregory Power Plant. Defendants must 
inform any person making an inquiry 
relating to a possible purchase of the 
Divestiture Assets that the Divestiture 
Assets are being divested in accordance 
with this Final Judgment and must 
provide that person with a copy of this 
Final Judgment. Defendants must offer 
to furnish to all prospective Acquirers, 
subject to customary confidentiality 
assurances, all information and 
documents relating to the Divestiture 
Assets that are customarily provided in 
a due diligence process; provided, 
however, that Defendants need not provide information or documents 
subject to the attorney-client privilege or 
work-product doctrine. Defendants must 
make all information and documents 
available to Plaintiffs at the same time 
that the information and documents are 
made available to any other person. 
I. Defendants must provide 
prospective Acquirers with (1) access to 
make inspections of the Divestiture 
Assets; (2) access to all environmental, 
zoning, and other permitting documents 
and information relating to the 
Divestiture Assets; and (3) access to all 
financial, operational, or other 
documents and information relating to 
the Divestiture Assets that would 
customarily be provided as part of a due 
diligence process. Defendants also must 
disclose all encumbrances on any part 
of the Divestiture Assets, including on 
intangible property. Provided, however, 
that a prospective Acquirer interested in 
purchasing only one or some of the 
Divestiture Assets must be provided 
with (1)–(3) for only the relevant 
Divestiture Assets of interest. 
J. Defendants must cooperate with 
and assist any Acquirer in identifying 
and, at the option of Acquirer, hiring all 
Relevant Personnel, including: 
1. Within 10 business days following 
receipt of a request by an Acquirer or a 
Plaintiff, Defendants must identify all 
Relevant Personnel to the requesting 
Acquirer and the Plaintiffs, including by 
providing organization charts covering 
all Relevant Personnel. 
2. Within 10 business days following 
receipt of a request by an Acquirer or a 
Plaintiff, Defendants must provide to 
the requesting Acquirer and Plaintiffs 
additional information relating to 
Relevant Personnel, including name, job 
title, reporting relationships, past 
experience, responsibilities, training 
and educational histories, relevant 
certifications, and job performance 
evaluations. Defendants must also 
provide to a requesting Acquirer and 
Plaintiffs information relating to current 
and accrued compensation and benefits 
of Relevant Personnel, including most 
recent bonuses paid, aggregate annual 
compensation, current target or 
guaranteed bonus, if any, any retention 
agreement or incentives, and any other 
payments due, compensation or benefits 
accrued, or promises made to the 
Relevant Personnel. If Defendants are 
barred by any applicable law from 
providing any of this information, 
Defendants must provide, within 10 
business days following receipt of the 
request, the requested information to the 
full extent permitted by law and also 
must provide a written explanation of 
Defendants’ inability to provide the 
remaining information, including 
specifically identifying the provisions of 
the applicable laws. 
3. At the request of an Acquirer, 
Defendants must promptly make 
Relevant Personnel available for private 
interviews with the requesting Acquirer 
during normal business hours at a 
mutually agreeable location. 
4. Defendants must not interfere with 
any effort by an Acquirer to employ any 
Relevant Personnel. Interference 
includes offering to increase the 
compensation or improve the benefits of 
Relevant Personnel at any time after the 
date of the filing of this document, 
unless (a) the offer is part of an annual 
compensation increase or improvement 
in benefits pursuant to the Defendants’ 
compensation and benefit programs 
existing as of December 1, 2025, (b) the 
offer is part of a tenure-based, automatic 
increase in compensation or 
improvement in benefits, (c) the offer is 
otherwise required pursuant to the 
terms of collective bargaining 
agreements relating to the Divested 
Assets, (d) the offer is consistent with 
the terms of the Asset Preservation and 
Hold Separate Stipulation and Order, or 
(e) the offer is approved by the United 
States in its sole discretion. Defendants’ 
obligations under this Paragraph IV.J.4. 
will expire 150 calendar days after the 
Divestiture Date for the relevant 
Divestiture Assets. 
5. For Relevant Personnel who elect 
employment with an Acquirer within 
150 calendar days of the Divestiture 
Date for the relevant Divestiture Assets, 
Defendants must waive all non-compete 
and non-disclosure agreements; vest and 
pay to the Relevant Personnel (or to 
Acquirer for payment to the employee) 
on a prorated basis any bonuses, 
incentives, other salary, benefits, or 
other compensation fully or partially 
accrued at the time of the transfer of the 
employee to Acquirer; vest any 
unvested pension and other equity 
rights; and provide all other benefits 
that those Relevant Personnel otherwise 
would have been provided had the 
Relevant Personnel continued 
employment with Defendants, including 
any retention bonuses or payments. 
Defendants may maintain reasonable 
restrictions on disclosure by Relevant 
Personnel of Defendants’ proprietary 
non-public information that is unrelated 
to the Divestiture Assets and not 
otherwise required to be disclosed by 
this Final Judgment. 
K. Defendants must warrant to any 
Acquirer that (1) the Divestiture Assets 
to be divested to that Acquirer will be 
operational and without material defect 
on the date of their transfer to the 
Acquirer; (2) the Divestiture Assets to be 
divested to that Acquirer will be 
consistent with Good Utility Practice, 
subject to legal or regulatory restrictions 
on any of the Divestiture Assets in 
existence on the date of sale; (3) there 
are no material defects in the 
environmental, zoning, or other permits 
relating to the operation of the 
Divestiture Assets to be divested to that 
Acquirer; and (4) Defendants have 
disclosed all material encumbrances on 
any part of the Divestiture Assets to be 
divested to that Acquirer, including on 
intangible property. Following the sale 
of any Divestiture Assets, Defendants 
must not undertake, directly or 
indirectly, challenges to the 
environmental, zoning, or other permits 
relating to the operation of those 
Divestiture Assets. 
L. Defendants must use best efforts to 
assist the Acquirer or Acquirers to 
obtain all necessary licenses,

relevant Divestiture Assets. Until an 
Acquirer obtains the necessary licenses, 
registrations, and permits, Defendants 
must provide that Acquirer with the 
benefit of Defendants’ licenses, 
registrations, and permits to the full 
extent permissible by law. 
M. If any term of an agreement 
between Defendants and an Acquirer, 
including an agreement to effectuate any 
of the divestitures required by this Final 
Judgment, varies from a term of this 
Final Judgment, to the extent that 
Defendants cannot fully comply with 
both, this Final Judgment determines 
Defendants’ obligations. 
V. Appointment of Divestiture Trustee 
A. If Defendants have not divested all 
of the Divestiture Assets within the 
period specified in Paragraph IV.A., 
Defendants must immediately notify 
Plaintiffs of that fact in writing. Upon 
application of the United States, which 
Defendants may not oppose, the Court 
will appoint a divestiture trustee 
selected by the United States and 
approved by the Court to effect the 
divestiture of any of the Divestiture 
Assets that have not been sold during 
the time periods specified in Paragraph 
IV.A. 
B. After the appointment of a 
divestiture trustee by the Court, only the 
divestiture trustee will have the right to 
sell those Divestiture Assets that the 
divestiture trustee has been appointed 
to sell. The divestiture trustee will have 
the power and authority to accomplish 
the divestitures to an Acquirer or 
Acquirers acceptable to the United 
States, in its sole discretion, after 
consultation with Texas, at a price and 
on terms obtainable through reasonable 
effort by the divestiture trustee, subject 
to the provisions of Sections IV, V, and 
VI of this Final Judgment, and will have 
other powers as the Court deems 
appropriate. The divestiture trustee 
must sell the Divestiture Assets as 
quickly as possible. 
C. Defendants may not object to a sale 
by the divestiture trustee on any ground 
other than malfeasance by the 
divestiture trustee. Objections by 
Defendants must be conveyed in writing 
to the United States and the divestiture 
trustee within 10 calendar days after the 
divestiture trustee has provided the 
notice of proposed divestiture required 
by Section VI. 
D. The divestiture trustee will serve at 
the cost and expense of Defendants 
pursuant to a written agreement, on 
terms and conditions, including 
confidentiality requirements and 
conflict of interest certifications, 
approved by the United States in its sole 
discretion. 
E. The divestiture trustee may hire at 
the cost and expense of Defendants any 
agents or consultants, including 
investment bankers, attorneys, and 
accountants, that are reasonably 
necessary in the divestiture trustee’s 
judgment to assist with the divestiture 
trustee’s duties. These agents or 
consultants will be accountable solely to 
the divestiture trustee and will serve on 
terms and conditions, including 
confidentiality requirements and 
conflict-of-interest certifications, 
approved by the United States in its sole 
discretion. 
F. The compensation of the 
divestiture trustee and agents or 
consultants hired by the divestiture 
trustee must be reasonable in light of the 
value of the Divestiture Assets and 
based on a fee arrangement that 
provides the divestiture trustee with 
incentives based on the price and terms 
of the divestiture and the speed with 
which it is accomplished. If the 
divestiture trustee and Defendants are 
unable to reach agreement on the 
divestiture trustee’s compensation or 
other terms and conditions of 
engagement within 14 calendar days of 
the appointment of the divestiture 
trustee by the Court, the United States, 
in its sole discretion, may take 
appropriate action, including by making 
a recommendation to the Court. Within 
three business days of hiring an agent or 
consultant, the divestiture trustee must 
provide written notice of the hiring and 
rate of compensation to Defendants and 
the United States. 
G. The divestiture trustee must 
account for all monies derived from the 
sale of the Divestiture Assets by the 
divestiture trustee and all costs and 
expenses incurred. Within 30 calendar 
days of the Divestiture Date, the 
divestiture trustee must submit that 
accounting to the Court for approval. 
After approval by the Court of the 
divestiture trustee’s accounting, 
including fees for unpaid services and 
those of agents or consultants hired by 
the divestiture trustee, all remaining 
money must be paid to Defendants, and 
the trust will then be terminated. 
H. Defendants must use best efforts to 
assist the divestiture trustee to 
accomplish the required divestitures, 
including best efforts to obtain all 
necessary Regulatory Approvals. Subject 
to reasonable protection for trade 
secrets, other confidential research, 
development, or commercial 
information, or any applicable 
privileges, Defendants must provide the 
divestiture trustee and agents or 
consultants retained by the divestiture 
trustee with full and complete access to 
all personnel, books, records, and 
facilities of the Divestiture Assets. 
Defendants also must provide or 
develop financial and other information 
relevant to the Divestiture Assets that 
the divestiture trustee may reasonably 
request. Defendants must not take any 
action to interfere with or to impede the 
divestiture trustee’s accomplishment of 
the divestitures. 
I. The divestiture trustee must 
maintain complete records of all efforts 
made to sell the Divestiture Assets, 
including by providing monthly reports 
to the Plaintiffs setting forth the 
divestiture trustee’s efforts to 
accomplish the divestitures ordered by 
this Final Judgment. The reports must 
include the name, address, and 
telephone number of each person who, 
during the preceding month, made an 
offer to acquire, expressed an interest in 
acquiring, entered into negotiations to 
acquire, or was contacted or made an 
inquiry about acquiring any interest in 
the Divestiture Assets and must describe 
in detail each contact. 
J. If the divestiture trustee has not 
accomplished the divestitures ordered 
by this Final Judgment within 180 
calendar days of appointment, the 
divestiture trustee must promptly 
provide Plaintiffs with a report setting 
forth: (1) the divestiture trustee’s efforts 
to accomplish the required divestitures; 
(2) the reasons, in the divestiture 
trustee’s judgment, why the required 
divestitures have not been 
accomplished; and (3) the divestiture 
trustee’s recommendations for 
completing the divestitures. Following 
receipt of that report, the United States 
may make additional recommendations 
to the Court. The Court thereafter may 
enter such orders as it deems 
appropriate to carry out the purpose of 
this Final Judgment, which may include 
extending the trust and the term of the 
divestiture trustee’s appointment by a 
period requested by the United States. 
K. The divestiture trustee will serve 
until divestiture of all Divestiture Assets 
is completed or for a term otherwise 
ordered by the Court. 
L. If the United States determines that 
the divestiture trustee is not acting 
diligently or in a reasonably cost- 
effective manner, the United States may 
recommend that the Court appoint a 
substitute divestiture trustee. 
VI. Notice of Proposed Divestiture 
A. Within two business days 
following execution of a definitive 
agreement to divest the Divestiture 
Assets, Defendants or the divestiture 
trustee, whichever is then responsible 
for effecting the divestitures, must

divestiture. If the divestiture trustee is 
responsible for completing the 
divestiture, the divestiture trustee also 
must notify Defendants. The notice 
must set forth the details of the 
proposed divestiture and list the name, 
address, and telephone number of each 
person not previously identified who 
offered or expressed an interest in or 
desire to acquire any ownership interest 
in the Divestiture Assets. 
B. After receipt of the notice required 
by Paragraph VI.A., the United States, 
after consultation with Texas, may make 
one or more requests to Defendants or 
the divestiture trustee for additional 
information concerning the proposed 
divestiture, the proposed Acquirers, and 
other prospective Acquirers. Defendants 
and the divestiture trustee must furnish 
any additional information requested 
within 15 calendar days of the receipt 
of each request unless the United States 
provides written agreement to a 
different period. 
C. Within 45 calendar days after 
receipt of the notice required by 
Paragraph VI.A or within 20 calendar 
days after the United States has been 
provided the additional information 
requested pursuant to Paragraph VI.B, 
whichever is later, the United States 
will provide written notice to 
Defendants and any divestiture trustee 
that states whether the United States, in 
its sole discretion, after consultation 
with Texas, objects to the proposed 
Acquirers or any other aspect of the 
proposed divestitures. Without written 
notice that the United States does not 
object, a divestiture may not be 
consummated. If the United States 
provides written notice that it does not 
object, the divestiture may be 
consummated, subject only to 
Defendants’ limited right to object to the 
sale under Paragraph V.C. of this Final 
Judgment. Upon objection by 
Defendants pursuant to Paragraph V.C., 
a divestiture by the divestiture trustee 
may not be consummated unless 
approved by the Court. 
VII. Financing 
Defendants may not finance all or any 
part of any Acquirer’s purchase of all or 
part of the Divestiture Assets. 
VIII. Asset Preservation and Hold 
Separate Obligations 
Defendants must take all steps 
necessary to comply with the Asset 
Preservation and Hold Separate 
Stipulation and Order entered by the 
Court. 
IX. Affidavits 
A. Within 20 calendar days of entry 
of the Hold Separate Stipulation and

divestitures required by this Final 
Judgment have been completed, each 
Defendant must deliver to Plaintiffs an 
affidavit, signed by each Defendant’s 
Chief Financial Officer and General 
Counsel, describing in reasonable detail 
the fact and manner of that Defendant’s 
compliance with this Final Judgment. 
The United States, in its sole discretion, 
may approve different signatories for the 
affidavits. 
B. Each affidavit required by 
Paragraph IX.A. must include: (1) the 
name, address, and telephone number of 
each person who, during the preceding 
30 calendar days, made an offer to 
acquire, expressed an interest in 
acquiring, entered into negotiations to 
acquire, or was contacted or made an 
inquiry about acquiring, an interest in 
the Divestiture Assets and describe in 
detail each contact with such persons 
during that period; (2) a description of 
the efforts Defendants have taken to 
solicit buyers for and complete the sale 
of the Divestiture Assets and to provide 
required information to prospective 
Acquirers; and (3) a description of any 
limitations placed by Defendants on 
information provided to prospective 
Acquirers. Objection by the United 
States to information provided by 
Defendants to prospective Acquirers 
must be made within 14 calendar days 
of receipt of the affidavit, except that the 
United States may object at any time if 
the information set forth in the affidavit 
is not true or complete. 
C. Defendants must keep all records of 
any efforts made to divest the 
Divestiture Assets until one year after 
the Divestiture Date.

filing of the Complaint in this matter, 
each Defendant must deliver to 
Plaintiffs an affidavit signed by each 
Defendant’s Chief Financial Officer and 
General Counsel that describes in 
reasonable detail all actions that 
Defendant has taken and all steps that 
Defendant has implemented on an 
ongoing basis to comply with Section 
VIII of this Final Judgment. The United 
States, in its sole discretion, may 
approve different signatories for the 
affidavits. 
E. If a Defendant makes any changes 
to actions and steps described in 
affidavits provided pursuant to 
Paragraph IX.A, the Defendant must, 
within 15 calendar days after any 
change is implemented, deliver to 
Plaintiffs an affidavit describing those 
changes. 
F. Defendants must keep all records of 
any efforts made to comply with Section 
IX until one year after the Divestiture 
Date. 
X. Compliance Inspection 
A. For the purposes of determining or 
securing compliance with this Final 
Judgment or of related orders such as 
the Asset Preservation and Hold 
Separate Stipulation and Order or of 
determining whether this Final 
Judgment should be modified or 
vacated, upon written request of an 
authorized representative of the 
Assistant Attorney General for the 
Antitrust Division and reasonable notice

retained by the United States: 
1. to have access during Defendants’ 
office hours to inspect and copy, or at 
the option of the United States, to 
require Defendants to provide electronic 
copies of all books, ledgers, accounts, 
records, data, and documents, wherever 
located, in the possession, custody, or 
control of Defendants relating to any 
matters contained in this Final 
Judgment; and 
2. to interview, either informally or on 
the record, Defendants’ officers, 
employees, or agents, wherever located, 
who may have their individual counsel 
present, relating to any matters 
contained in this Final Judgment. The 
interviews must be subject to the 
reasonable convenience of the 
interviewee and without restraint or 
interference by Defendants. 
B. Upon the written request of an 
authorized representative of the 
Assistant Attorney General for the 
Antitrust Division, Defendants must 
submit written reports or respond to 
written interrogatories, under oath if 
requested, relating to any matters 
contained in this Final Judgment. 
XI. No Reacquisition 
Defendants may not reacquire any 
part of or any interest in the Divestiture 
Assets during the term of this Final 
Judgment without prior written 
authorization of the United States. 
XII. Public Disclosure 
A. No information or documents 
obtained pursuant to any provision in 
this Final Judgment may be divulged by 
Plaintiffs to any person other than an 
authorized representative of the 
executive branch of the United States or 
an authorized representative of Texas, 
except in the course of legal proceedings

a party, including grand-jury 
proceedings, for the purpose of 
evaluating a proposed Acquirer or 
securing compliance with this Final 
Judgment, or as otherwise required by 
law. 
B. In the event of a request by a third 
party, pursuant to the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or similar 
state disclosure laws, for disclosure of 
information obtained pursuant to any 
provision of this Final Judgment, the 
United States will act in accordance 
with that statute and the Department of 
Justice regulations at 28 CFR part 16, 
including the provision on confidential 
commercial information at 28 CFR 16.7, 
and Texas will act in accordance with 
its applicable disclosure laws. 
Defendants submitting information to 
the Antitrust Division or Texas should 
designate the confidential commercial 
information portions of all applicable 
documents and information under 28 
CFR 16.7 or the relevant state statute. 
Designations of confidentiality under 28 
CFR part 16 expire 10 years after 
submission, ‘‘unless the submitter 
requests and provides justification for a 
longer designation period.’’ See 28 CFR 16.7(b). 
C. If at the time that Defendants 
furnish information or documents to the 
United States or Texas pursuant to any 
provision of this Final Judgment, 
Defendants represent and identify in 
writing information or documents for 
which a claim of protection may be 
asserted under Rule 26(c)(1)(G) of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and 
Defendants mark each pertinent page of 
such material, ‘‘Subject to claim of 
protection under Rule 26(c)(1)(G) of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,’’ the 
United States and Texas must give 
Defendants 10 calendar days’ notice 
before divulging the material in any 
legal proceeding (other than a grand jury 
proceeding). 
XIII. Retention of Jurisdiction 
The Court retains jurisdiction to 
enable any party to this Final Judgment 
to apply to the Court at any time for 
further orders and directions as may be 
necessary or appropriate to carry out or 
construe this Final Judgment, to modify 
any of its provisions, to enforce 
compliance, and to punish violations of 
its provisions. 
XIV. Enforcement of Final Judgment 
A. The United States and Texas retain 
and reserve all rights to enforce the 
provisions of this Final Judgment, 
including the right to seek an order of 
contempt from the Court. In a civil 
contempt action, a motion to show 
cause, or a similar action brought by the 
United States or Texas relating to an 
alleged violation of this Final Judgment, 
the United States or Texas may establish 
a violation of this Final Judgment and 
the appropriateness of a remedy therefor 
by a preponderance of the evidence, and 
Defendants waive any argument that a 
different standard of proof should 
apply. 
B. This Final Judgment should be 
interpreted to give full effect to the 
procompetitive purposes of the antitrust 
laws and to restore the competition the 
Plaintiffs allege was harmed by the 
challenged conduct. Defendants may be 
held in contempt of, and the Court may 
enforce, any provision of this Final 
Judgment that, as interpreted by the 
Court in light of these procompetitive 
principles and applying ordinary tools 
of interpretation, is stated specifically 
and in reasonable detail, whether or not 
it is clear and unambiguous on its face. 
In any such interpretation, the terms of 
this Final Judgment should not be 
construed against either party as the 
drafter. 
C. In an enforcement proceeding in 
which the Court finds that Defendants 
have violated this Final Judgment, the 
United States may apply to the Court for 
an extension of this Final Judgment, 
together with other relief that may be 
appropriate. In connection with a 
successful effort by the United States or 
Texas to enforce this Final Judgment 
against a Defendant, whether litigated or 
resolved before litigation, Defendant 
must reimburse the United States and 
Texas for the fees and expenses of their 
attorneys, as well as all other costs 
including experts’ fees, incurred in 
connection with that effort to enforce 
this Final Judgment, including in the 
investigation of the potential violation. 
D. For a period of four years following 
the expiration of this Final Judgment, if 
the United States has evidence that a 
Defendant violated this Final Judgment 
before it expired, the United States, may 
file an action against that Defendant in 
this Court requesting that the Court 
order: (1) Defendant to comply with the 
terms of this Final Judgment for an 
additional term of at least four years 
following the filing of the enforcement 
action; (2) all appropriate contempt 
remedies; (3) additional relief needed to 
ensure the Defendant complies with the 
terms of this Final Judgment; and (4) 
fees or expenses as called for by this 
Section XIV. 
XV. Expiration of Final Judgment 
Unless the Court grants an extension, 
this Final Judgment will expire 10 years 
from the date of its entry, except that 
after five years from the date of its entry, 
this Final Judgment may be terminated 
upon notice by the United States to the 
Court, Defendants, and Texas that the 
divestitures have been completed and 
continuation of this Final Judgment is 
no longer necessary or in the public 
interest. 
XVI. Public Interest Determination 
Entry of this Final Judgment is in the 
public interest. The parties have 
complied with the requirements of the 
Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 
15 U.S.C. 16, including by making 
available to the public copies of this 
Final Judgment and the Competitive 
Impact Statement, public comments 
thereon, and any response to comments 
by the United States. Based upon the

Case No. 1:25–cv–04235–ABJ 
Competitive Impact Statement 
In accordance with the Antitrust 
Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 
16(b)–(h) (the ‘‘APPA’’ or ‘‘Tunney 
Act’’), the United States of America files 
this Competitive Impact Statement 
related to the proposed Final Judgment 
filed in this civil antitrust proceeding. 
I. Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding 
On January 10, 2025, Constellation 
Energy Corporation (‘‘Constellation’’) 
announced its agreement to acquire 
Calpine Corporation (‘‘Calpine’’) for a 
net purchase price of $26.6 billion (the 
‘‘Acquisition’’), a transaction that would 
create the largest wholesale electricity 
generating company in the United 
States. The United States and the State 
of Texas (collectively, the ‘‘Plaintiffs’’), 
filed a civil antitrust Complaint on 
December 5, 2025, seeking to enjoin the 
Acquisition. 
The Complaint alleges that the likely 
effect of this Acquisition would be to 
substantially lessen competition for 
wholesale electricity in two relevant 
geographic markets in violation of

Stipulation And Order, United States et al. v.

Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 
18. One market comprises the area 
operated by the Electric Reliability 
Council of Texas (‘‘ERCOT’’), an 
independent system operator that serves 
as the electricity grid and market 
operator for most of Texas. ERCOT’s 
electricity is delivered to more than 27 
million Texans, supplying 
approximately 90% of the state’s 
electricity demand. In 2024, ERCOT 
oversaw the sale of more than $14.4 
billion in wholesale electricity. The 
second market comprises the Coastal 
Mid-Atlantic area of the PJM 
Interconnection, LLC (‘‘PJM’’). PJM is a 
regional transmission organization that 
manages the largest electricity 
transmission grid in the United States. 
It serves all or parts of Delaware, 
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, 
Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, 
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, 
Virginia, West Virginia, and the District 
of Columbia, supplying electricity to 
more than 67 million Americans. The 
PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic geographic 
area is a distinct area within PJM that 
includes southeastern Pennsylvania, 
New Jersey, Delaware, and the eastern 
shores of Maryland and Virginia. In 
2024, approximately $4 billion of 
wholesale electricity was generated and 
supplied to more than 10 million people 
and businesses in PJM’s Coastal Mid- 
Atlantic area. 
Concurrent with filing the Complaint, 
the United States filed a proposed Final 
Judgment
1
and an Asset Preservation 
and Hold Separate Stipulation and 
Order (‘‘Stipulation and Order’’),
2
 
which are designed to remedy the loss 
of competition alleged in the Complaint. 
Under the proposed Final Judgment, 
which is explained more fully below, 
Constellation, Calpine, and CPN CS 
Holdco Corp. (collectively the 
‘‘Defendants’’) are required to divest the 
Calpine electric generating facilities 
listed below. 
In ERCOT: 
€Jack A. Fusco Energy Center, located southwest of the city of 
Houston, Texas (‘‘Jack A. Fusco’’); and 
€Calpine’s minority ownership interest in the Gregory Energy Center, 
located northeast of the city of Corpus 
Christi, Texas (‘‘Gregory’’). 
In PJM: 
€Bethlehem Energy Center, located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania 
(‘‘Bethlehem’’); 
€Edge Moor Energy Center, located in Wilmington, Delaware (‘‘Edge 
Moor’’); 
€Hay Road Energy Center, located in Wilmington, Delaware (‘‘Hay Road’’); 
and 
€York Energy Center (York 1 and York 2), located southeast of the city of 
York, Pennsylvania (‘‘York’’). 
The Stipulation and Order requires 
the Defendants to take certain steps to 
operate, preserve, and maintain the full 
economic viability, marketability, and 
competitiveness of the assets that must 
be divested pending entry of the 
proposed Final Judgment by this Court. 
Plant management and operations of the 
assets to be divested must be held 
entirely separate, distinct, and apart 
from Defendants’ other operations. 
For the four PJM electric generating 
facilities the Defendants must divest, 
the Stipulation and Order requires the 
Defendants to submit offers into the PJM 
day-ahead auction market, described in 
detail at Section II.B.2 below, at a price 
not greater than its costs. For each of 
these facilities, the Defendants must 
submit offers to this market at cost or 
lower, unless unable to do so due to an 
outage, as defined in the Stipulation and 
Order. In the event of an outage, the 
Defendants must submit offers for all 
output that is unaffected by the outage. 
Similarly, for Jack A. Fusco, the 
Defendants must submit offers into 
ERCOT’s day-ahead auction, described 
in detail at Section II.B.2 below, at a 
price not greater than its costs in 
accordance with the physical 
characteristics of the applicable units 
unless unable to do so due to an outage 
or because ERCOT has issued an 
Advanced Action Notice or Weather 
Watch as specified in the Stipulation 
and Order. In the event of an outage, 
ERCOT Advanced Action Notice, or 
ERCOT Weather Watch, the Defendants 
must submit offers for all output that is 
unaffected by the outage, ERCOT 
Advanced Action Notice, or ERCOT 
Weather Watch. The Stipulation and 
Order prohibits the Defendants from 
participating in the formulation, 
determination, or direction of the 
strategy for Gregory’s offers into the 
ERCOT auction markets. 
The purpose of these terms in the 
Stipulation and Order is to ensure that 
competition is maintained during the 
pendency of the required divestiture of 
the six Calpine electric generating 
facilities listed above. 
The Plaintiffs and Defendants have 
stipulated that the proposed Final 
Judgment may be entered after 
compliance with the APPA. Entry of the 
proposed Final Judgment will terminate 
this action, except that the Court will 
retain jurisdiction to construe, modify, 
or enforce the provisions of the 
proposed Final Judgment and to punish 
violations thereof. 
II. Description of Events Giving Rise to 
the Alleged Violations 
A. The Defendants and the Proposed 
Acquisition 
Constellation is a publicly held 
Pennsylvania corporation headquartered 
in Baltimore, Maryland. The company is 
one of the largest competitive electric 
generation companies in the nation, as 
measured by owned and contracted 
megawatts, generating $23.6 billion in 
revenue in 2024. Constellation controls 
approximately 5,000 megawatts (MW) of 
electric generation capacity in ERCOT 
and over 20,000 MW in PJM. For 
context, one MW serves between 800 to 
1,000 homes. 
Calpine is a privately held Delaware 
corporation headquartered in Houston, 
Texas. Calpine is the largest generator of 
electricity from natural gas and 
geothermal resources in the United 
States. Calpine’s power plants 
collectively have the capacity to 
generate approximately 9,000 MW of 
electricity in ERCOT, making it the 
third-largest electricity generation 
supplier in the state. In PJM, Calpine 
owns or exercises control over 14 total 
plants. These plants collectively provide 
more than 5,000 MW of capacity. 
Defendant CPN CS Holdco Corp. 
(‘‘Holdco’’) is a Delaware corporation 
headquartered in Houston, Texas. It is a 
direct wholly owned subsidiary of 
Calpine that was created to serve as a 
vehicle for Calpine’s sale to 
Constellation. 
Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of 
Merger dated January 10, 2025, 
Defendant Constellation proposes to 
acquire Defendant Calpine for a net 
purchase price of $26.6 billion. 
B. The Acquisition’s Competitive Effects 
The Complaint alleges that the 
Acquisition would result in likely 
anticompetitive effects in the markets 
for wholesale electricity in ERCOT and 
PJM’s Coastal Mid-Atlantic area. 
1. Electricity Background 
Generating companies such as 
Constellation and Calpine own power 
plants that produce electricity. Electric 
utilities and retail providers purchase 
that electricity from the generating 
companies and resell it to their end 
customers, such as households and 
businesses. 
Power plants, which often contain 
several individual generating units, 
transform fuel or renewable resources

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159218 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices into electricity. Steam turbines, 
combustion turbines, and combined- 
cycle turbines powered by natural gas, 
oil, or coal, as well as nuclear reactors, 
wind turbines, and solar panels are 
important electric generating 
technologies. 
The cost to operate generating units 
varies considerably, based primarily on 
the cost of fuel and the efficiency of 
converting that fuel into electricity: 
€Renewable units, such as solar farms and wind turbines, have very low 
operating costs, but can operate only 
when the sun is shining or the wind is 
blowing. 
€Baseload units, such as nuclear plants and some coal-fired steam 
turbine units, also have relatively low 
operating costs and provide consistent 
generation throughout the day and 
across each season of the year. Nuclear 
units are designed to operate at full 
capacity unless they are offline for 
refueling outages. For many coal units, 
it is impractical to turn them on and off 
on a short-term basis because of long 
startup times and mechanical stress 
from cycling the units on and off. 
€Mid-merit units, including combined-cycle natural gas units and 
some coal steam turbines, can typically 
turn on or have their output adjusted 
more quickly than baseload units. 
€Peaking units, such as oil- and gas- fired combustion or gas-fired steam 
turbine units, tend to run only during 
periods of high (or ‘‘peak’’) electricity 
demand. They typically have the 
highest operating costs of any 
generation units but are also the easiest 
to turn on and shut off. This makes 
them critical for balancing supply and 
demand to keep the lights on without 
overloading the system. 
Electricity generated at a plant is 
transported via an extensive set of 
interconnected high voltage lines and 
equipment, known as the transmission 
grid, to lower voltage distribution lines 
that relay electricity to businesses and 
consumers in their homes. Operators, 
such as ERCOT and PJM, monitor the 
transmission grid closely to prevent too 
little or too much electricity from 
flowing over the grid, either of which 
can risk widespread blackouts through 
damage to the lines, equipment, or 
generating units connected to the grid. 
To avoid damage and service 
interruptions, grid operators manage the 
grid to prevent additional electricity 
from flowing over a transmission line as 
it approaches its operating limit (a 
‘‘transmission constraint’’). 
2. ERCOT and PJM Use Auctions to Set 
the Price of Electricity 
ERCOT and PJM each oversees two 
auctions that set the wholesale 
electricity price in their respective 
areas. These auctions are the primary 
means by which electricity generators 
compete to supply electricity in ERCOT 
and PJM and drive the price consumers 
ultimately pay for it. 
The first auction is called the ‘‘day- 
ahead auction.’’ Each generator offering 
electricity in the day-ahead market 
submits an individual offer for each of 
its participating generating units 
indicating the amount of electricity the 
unit is willing to sell each hour of the 
following day and the price at which it 
is willing to sell. Similarly, each buyer 
typically submits a bid identifying the 
amount of electricity that the buyer 
expects to need for each hour of the 
following day. ERCOT and PJM will 
take each of the bids and offers, add 
them up, and determine how much 
electricity will be demanded each hour. 
ERCOT and PJM will then ‘‘dispatch’’ 
generating units to meet each hour’s 
demand. Subject to the physical 
limitations of their transmission grids, 
ERCOT and PJM will call on individual 
units to operate in ‘‘merit’’ order, 
meaning that each will begin by 
accepting the least-expensive offer and 
thereafter, accept offers from units at 
progressively higher prices until the 
needs for each hour of the next day are 
met. The price offered by the last unit 
to be accepted to meet demand for an 
individual hour sets the clearing price 
for that hour. All other units whose 
offers also have been accepted for that 
individual hour receive the price of that 
highest cost unit, regardless of their 
individual offer price (or their units’ 
costs). Thus, a generator may be paid a 
higher clearing price than its own offer 
price if electricity from additional, 
higher-priced generating units is needed 
to meet demand. 
The second auction is a ‘‘real-time’’ 
auction that operates functionally in the 
same way. However, it clears the same 
day the electricity is required and 
reconciles the results of the day-ahead 
auctions with actual supply and 
demand. In the real-time auctions, 
ERCOT and PJM set prices for each five- 
minute interval of the day rather than 
each hour as in the day-ahead auction. 
3. Wholesale Electricity Markets 
As alleged in the complaint, 
wholesale electricity is a relevant 
product for evaluating the competitive 
impact of the Acquisition. Each hourly 
increment in which wholesale 
electricity is sold in ERCOT’s or PJM’s 
‘‘day-ahead’’ auction and each five- 
minute increment in the ERCOT or PJM 
‘‘real-time’’ auctions is a separate 
relevant product market. This is because 
electricity in one time period is not a 
substitute for electricity in another time 
period. While supply and demand for 
wholesale electricity varies in different 
periods, both auctions share a common 
feature: in the event of a small but 
significant non-transitory increase in the 
price of wholesale electricity at relevant 
times, not enough purchasers are likely 
to switch away from wholesale 
electricity to make that increase 
unprofitable. Additionally, in the event 
of a small but significant non-transitory 
increase in the price of wholesale 
electricity within an hourly or five- 
minute time period, not enough 
purchasers would switch to consuming 
wholesale electricity in a different time 
period to make that price increase 
unprofitable. This means that each of 
these specific auction time periods is a 
relevant product market and a ‘‘line of 
commerce’’ within the meaning of 
Section 7 of the Clayton Act. 
Although each of these specific time 
periods is a relevant product market, 
they can be aggregated into a ‘‘cluster 
market’’ for analytical convenience for 
considering whether the Acquisition 
violates the antitrust laws. For example, 
all 24 hours in a single day in either PJM 
or ERCOT’s ‘‘day-ahead’’ auction could 
be aggregated into one market, as could 
all five-minute intervals in a single hour 
in PJM or ERCOT’s ‘‘real-time’’ auction. 
4. Geographic Markets 
At times, transmission constraints 
within power grids limit the free flow of 
electricity across a geographic region. 
Energy produced on one side of a 
constraint cannot easily flow to the 
other side of the constraint once the 
transfer limit has been reached. 
Transmission constraints can affect 
electricity flow within ERCOT and PJM 
to varying degrees with PJM, in 
particular, impacted. When constraints 
arise, PJM cannot dispatch generating 
units in merit order if doing so would 
overload a transmission constraint, a 
concept called ‘‘congestion.’’ To avoid 
congestion while still satisfying 
demand, PJM must call on higher-priced 
units that, given their grid location, do 
not overload the transmission 
constraint. When this happens, prices 
are lower on one side of the constraint 
and higher on the other side. 
a. PJM’s Coastal Mid-Atlantic Market 
The Complaint alleges that the PJM 
Coastal Mid-Atlantic geographic area is 
a relevant geographic market for 
evaluating the potential competitive

Section 7 of the Clayton Act covers ERCOT, a 
geographic region located entirely within the state 
of Texas. 
impact of the Acquisition. PJM Coastal 
Mid-Atlantic is a distinct area within 
PJM that includes parts of southeastern 
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, 
and the eastern shores of Maryland and 
Virginia. 
PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic is affected 
by Nottingham, a major transmission 
constraint located near the Maryland- 
Pennsylvania border that divides PJM 
Coastal Mid-Atlantic from the rest of the 
PJM region. Generators within PJM 
Coastal Mid-Atlantic frequently sell 
electricity into other areas to the west 
and south. However, when transmission 
lines are constrained, the amount of 
electricity that generators within PJM 
Coastal Mid-Atlantic can sell outside of 
the area is limited. As a result, 
electricity prices in PJM Coastal Mid- 
Atlantic often differ from other areas 
within the PJM region. 
When Nottingham is constrained, 
purchasers of wholesale electricity for 
use in PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic have 
limited capability to turn to generation 
outside of PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic. At 
such times, the amount of electricity 
that purchasers could obtain from 
generators outside PJM Coastal Mid- 
Atlantic is insufficient to deter 
generators located in PJM Coastal Mid- 
Atlantic from imposing a small but 
significant non-transitory price increase. 
Thus, PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic is a 
relevant geographic market and a 
‘‘section of the country’’ within the 
meaning of Section 7 of the Clayton Act. 
b. ERCOT Market 
The Complaint also alleges that the 
entire ERCOT region is a relevant 
geographic market for evaluating the 
potential competitive impact of the 
Acquisition. The ERCOT grid 
experiences very little congestion. In the 
event of a small but significant non- 
transitory increase in the price of 
wholesale electricity within ERCOT, not 
enough purchasers in the ERCOT region 
are likely to switch to purchasing from 
regions outside ERCOT to make that 
increase unprofitable. At its annual 
peak, the electricity in demand in 
ERCOT exceeds 85,000 MW. ERCOT’s 
connections to Mexico’s grid and to the 
Southwest Power Pool grid, which 
collectively can for approximately 1,200 
MW of electricity to flow into ERCOT. 
The volume of these power flows is 
insufficient to prevent generators from 
imposing a small but significant non- 
transitory price increase within ERCOT. 
Thus, the region covered by ERCOT is 
a relevant geographic market and a 
‘‘section of the country’’ within the 
meaning of Section 7 of the Clayton 
Act.

5. Anticompetitive Effects 
As alleged in the Complaint, the 
Acquisition risks substantially lessening 
competition in the ERCOT and PJM 
Coastal Mid-Atlantic wholesale 
electricity markets. The combination of 
Constellation and Calpine’s electricity 
generating units serving ERCOT and 
PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic would 
eliminate competition between them 
and enhance Constellation’s post- 
Acquisition ability and incentive to 
withhold electricity to raise wholesale 
electricity price anticompetitively in 
those markets. 
Under certain circumstances, a 
wholesale electricity generator, such as 
Constellation or Calpine, may profitably 
withhold electricity, leading to 
increased wholesale electricity prices. 
An operator of a generating unit may 
withhold capacity in several ways, 
including by submitting high offers for 
some of its higher-cost units into the 
day-ahead or real-time auctions so that 
its units are not dispatched. If a unit is 
withheld from an auction, then a higher- 
priced unit may need to take the place 
of the withheld capacity because the 
units are dispatched in merit order, that 
is from the lowest-priced unit to the 
highest until demand matches supply. 
Thus, withholding a unit (or units) can 
lead to a higher market-clearing price 
because the withheld units force ERCOT 
or PJM to accept higher-priced offers 
from units that end up setting the 
market clearing price. All accepted units 
are paid the identical price regardless of 
the unit’s offer price or its operating 
cost. Withholding can be profitable for 
generating companies that offer multiple 
units into an auction. For example, a 
generator might have four units 
accepted and a fifth higher-cost unit 
that, if accepted, would be one of the 
last units needed to meet demand and 
thus affect the market clearing price. If 
that fifth unit were withheld, then 
ERCOT or PJM would be required to 
accept an even higher-priced unit, 
thereby increasing the market-clearing 
price that would benefit the generator’s 
four other units which had been 
accepted. In this example, withholding 
the fifth unit would be profitable for the 
generator if it increases the market- 
clearing price such that increased 
profits from the four dispatched units 
attributable to that price increase exceed 
the lost profits that would have been 
earned by the fifth unit if it were offered 
into the market at the lower market- 
clearing price. This type of electricity 
withholding is well established in a 
large body of theoretical and empirical 
literature in economics, public policy, 
and electricity markets analysis. 
The risk that an electricity generator 
such as Constellation or Calpine may 
profitably withhold depends in part on 
the generator’s asset mix. A profitable 
withholding strategy typically requires a 
combination of units that confer the 
ability to withhold and relatively low- 
cost units that provide an incentive to 
withhold. Units that provide an 
incentive to withhold typically are 
relatively low cost and operate 
consistently throughout the day and 
across all seasons of the year. As the 
Complaint describes, baseload units, 
such as nuclear plants and some coal- 
fired steam turbine units, are low cost 
and consistently operating. Because 
these types of units run frequently and 
at operating costs lower than the 
market-clearing price, they benefit from 
the higher prices and provide a 
significant incentive for their owner to 
withhold another, higher-cost 
generating asset. 
These higher-cost units provide the 
ability to raise the market-clearing price. 
As the Complaint describes, peaking 
units, such as oil- and gas-fired 
combustion turbine or internal 
combustion units, are among the 
highest-cost electricity generators. 
Peaking units are also relatively easy to 
turn on and shut off and typically 
operate during high-demand periods, 
often setting the market-clearing price. 
Mid-merit units, including combined- 
cycle natural gas units and some coal 
steam turbines, often possess similar 
characteristics. As the Complaint 
describes, such units can typically be 
turned on and off or adjust their output 
more rapidly than baseload units. 
Although they are typically lower cost 
than peaking units, mid-merit units set 
the market-clearing price during periods 
of lower demand. This means that an 
owner of a peaking or mid-merit unit 
can raise the market-clearing price by 
withholding the unit. Withholding a 
unit is profitable to the extent that the 
company also owns enough low-cost 
units that confer incentive to at least 
recoup the profit foregone by 
withholding the unit that confers the 
withholding ability. 
The Acquisition would likely enhance 
Constellation’s ability and incentive to 
withhold electricity to raise prices in 
ERCOT and PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic 
by giving Constellation a broader 
portfolio of units and a richer mix of 
assets. This combination of assets would 
enable Constellation to profitably

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159220 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices withhold one or more units in the 
ERCOT and PJM day-ahead and real- 
time auctions to a greater degree than 
either it or Calpine would have had 
individually, leading to higher market- 
clearing prices. 
As the Complaint alleges, through the 
Acquisition, Constellation is increasing 
its share of mid-merit and peaking units 
serving PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic. The 
acquisition of mid-merit and peaking 
units would give Constellation an 
enhanced ability to profitably withhold 
in that market. The additional revenues 
received by Constellation’s lower-cost 
generation units, including its nuclear 
plants, because of anticompetitively 
higher prices in PJM Coastal Mid- 
Atlantic would more than compensate 
for the lost profits from the generating 
unit(s) withheld. 
Similarly, in ERCOT, the Complaint 
alleges that after the Acquisition, 
Constellation would control more than 
12% of ERCOT’s generating capacity, 
and over 20% of the natural gas 
generation units in ERCOT that often set 
the clearing price. As the Complaint 
alleges, natural gas units set the market- 
clearing price in ERCOT the majority of 
the time, making them particularly 
valuable in Texas, where the electricity 
grid relies on gas to complement and 
support its increasing use of 
intermittent renewable resources such 
as sun and wind to generate electricity. 
Thus, the Acquisition would confer on 
Constellation an enhanced ability to 
profitably withhold. The additional 
revenues received by Constellation’s 
lower-cost generating units because of 
anticompetitively higher market-wide 
prices would frequently more than 
compensate for the lost profits from the 
generating unit(s) withheld. 
6. Possible Entry and Expansion 
Unlikely To Offset Anticompetitive 
Effects 
Entry of additional generation into 
either the PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic 
market or ERCOT market is unlikely to 
be timely or sufficient in deterring or 
counteracting the competitive harm that 
may result from the Acquisition. 
Expansion by existing generators in 
those markets is similarly unlikely to 
occur in a sufficient and timely fashion 
to prevent such harm. Wholesale 
electricity markets feature high barriers 
to entry and expansion. Among those 
barriers, building new generation 
capacity in either the ERCOT and PJM 
Coastal Mid-Atlantic regions requires 
significant capital investment in 
generating equipment, infrastructure, 
and technology, and generally takes 
many years, considering the necessary 
environmental, safety, zoning, and 
regulatory approvals. Furthermore, the 
anticipated increase in electricity 
demand (e.g., to power AI data centers) has led to long queues for the delivery 
of new gas turbines. There are 
additional barriers affecting the PJM 
Coastal Mid-Atlantic market. For 
example, building new high-voltage 
transmission lines that would relieve 
the constraints that limit the flow of 
electricity out of PJM Coastal Mid- 
Atlantic would also generally take many 
years, and require significant capital 
investment and multiple environmental, 
safety, zoning, and regulatory approvals. 
III. Explanation of the Proposed Final 
Judgment 
The relief required by the proposed 
Final Judgment will remedy the loss of 
competition alleged in the Complaint by 
establishing one or more independent 
and economically viable competitors in 
the ERCOT and PJM Coastal Mid- 
Atlantic wholesale electricity markets. 
A. Divestitures 
Paragraph IV.A of the proposed Final 
Judgment requires Defendants, within 
240 calendar days after consummation 
of the Acquisition, to enter into a 
definitive contract or contracts to divest 
two sets of assets to an acquirer or 
acquirers acceptable to the United 
States. Allowing Defendants a 240-day 
period will help ensure that the 
transition of generation assets to an 
acquirer or acquirors will not occur 
during peak summer months. 
Defendants must divest the ‘‘ERCOT 
Divestiture Assets’’ as that term is 
defined in Paragraph II.H of the 
proposed Final Judgment. The ERCOT 
Divestiture Assets include Calpine’s 
Jack A. Fusco plant and Calpine’s 
ownership interest in the Gregory plant, 
including all of Defendants’ rights, 
titles, and interests in and to all 
property and assets, tangible and 
intangible, relating to or used in 
connection with the plants’ generation, 
dispatch, and offer of electricity from 
these plants. 
Defendants must also divest the ‘‘PJM 
Divestiture Assets’’ as that term is 
defined in Paragraph II.O of the 
proposed Final Judgment. The PJM 
Divestiture Assets include Calpine’s 
Bethlehem, York, Hay Road, and Edge 
Moor plants, including all of 
Defendants’ rights, titles, and interests 
in and to all property and assets, 
tangible and intangible, relating to or 
used in connection with the plants’ 
generation, dispatch, and offer of 
electricity in PJM. 
Defendants are responsible for 
divesting to an acquirer or acquirers 
acceptable to the United States in its 
sole discretion. The assets must be 
divested in such a way as to satisfy the 
United States, in its sole discretion, that 
the assets can and will be operated by 
an acquirer or acquirers as a viable, 
ongoing business that can compete 
effectively in the ERCOT and PJM 
Coastal Mid-Atlantic markets. 
Defendants must take all reasonable 
steps necessary to accomplish the 
divestitures quickly and must cooperate 
with any acquirer. 
1. Divestiture Assets 
Calpine’s two ERCOT plants to be 
divested as part of the ERCOT 
Divestiture Assets are Jack A. Fusco and 
Gregory. Jack A. Fusco is a 557 MW 
combined-cycle natural gas facility 
located in Richmond, Texas. Gregory is 
a 365 MW combined-cycle natural gas 
facility located in Gregory, Texas. 
Calpine owns approximately 28.5% of 
Gregory. 
Calpine’s four PJM Coastal Mid- 
Atlantic plants to be divested as part of 
the PJM Divestiture Assets are 
Bethlehem, York, Hay Road, and Edge 
Moor. Bethlehem is a 1,134 MW natural 
gas-fired combined cycle plant located 
in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. It began 
commercial operations in 2003. York 
comprises two generating units, known 
as York 1 and York 2. York 1 is a 569 
MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle 
unit. It began operations in 2011. York 
2 is an 828 MW natural gas-fired 
combined-cycle unit. It is newer than 
York 1, having begun operations in 
2019, eight years later. York 1 and 2 are 
in Peach Bottom Township, 
Pennsylvania. Hay Road is a 1,136 MW 
dual-fuel combined cycle plant. It began 
commercial operations in 1989. Edge 
Moor is a 707 MW simple cycle natural 
gas-fired plant that began commercial 
operations in 1965. Both Hay Road and 
Edge Moor are in Wilmington, 
Delaware. 
For each plant, the Defendants must 
divest the entirety of their rights, titles, 
and interests in and to all property and 
assets, tangible and intangible, relating 
to or used in connection with the 
generation, dispatch, and offer of 
electricity. This includes all real 
property, tangible personal property, 
intangible property, and intellectual 
property relating to each plant. This also 
includes all customer contracts and 
relationships, as well as all supply 
agreements. The proposed Final 
Judgment defines the entirety of the 
assets that the Defendants must divest 
as the ‘‘Divestiture Assets.’’ 
The divestiture requirements of the 
proposed Final Judgment will maintain 
competition for wholesale electricity in 
the ERCOT and PJM Coastal Mid-

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159221 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices Atlantic markets by allowing one or 
more competitors independent of the 
Defendants to acquire the Divestiture 
Assets. The proposed Final Judgment 
seeks to preserve competition by 
depriving Constellation of assets that are 
key to making it profitable for 
Constellation to withhold electricity 
generation to raise the market-clearing 
price in ERCOT and PJM’s day-ahead 
and real-time auctions. In ERCOT, 
Defendants must divest the Jack A. 
Fusco plant and Calpine’s interest in the 
Gregory plant. These plants are natural- 
gas plants, a critical fuel type in ERCOT 
that, as the Complaint alleges, set the 
market-clearing price the majority of the 
time. Constellation’s divestiture of these 
plants will keep it from gaining an 
enhanced ability to raise the market- 
clearing prices in the ERCOT auctions. 
In the PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic market, 
Defendants must divest the Bethlehem, 
York, Hay Road, and Edge Moor plants. 
These are mid-merit and peaking units, 
which often set the market-clearing 
price in the PJM Coastal Mid-Atlantic 
market. Divestiture of these four plants 
ensures that the Acquisition does not 
confer on Constellation an enhanced 
ability to withhold electricity to raise 
the market-clearing price and the 
incentive to make withholding 
profitable. Accordingly, the proposed 
Final Judgment protects competition in 
these markets. 
2. Relevant Personnel 
The proposed Final Judgment 
contains provisions intended to 
facilitate an acquirer’s efforts to hire 
certain employees. Specifically, 
Paragraph IV.J of the proposed Final 
Judgment requires Defendants to 
provide an acquirer, the United States, 
and the State of Texas with organization 
charts and information relating to these 
employees and to make them available 
for interviews. It also provides that 
Defendants must not interfere with any 
negotiations by an acquirer to hire these 
employees. In addition, for employees 
who elect employment with an acquirer, 
Defendants must waive all non-compete 
and non-disclosure agreements, vest all 
unvested pension and other equity 
rights, provide any pay pro rata, provide 
all compensation and benefits that those 
employees have fully or partially 
accrued, and provide all other benefits 
that the employees would generally be 
provided had those employees 
continued employment with 
Defendants, including but not limited to 
any retention bonuses or payments. 
3. Divestiture Trustee 
If Defendants do not accomplish the 
divestitures within the period 
prescribed in Paragraph IV.A of the 
proposed Final Judgment, Section V of 
the proposed Final Judgment provides 
that the Court will appoint a divestiture 
trustee selected by the United States to 
effect the divestiture. If a divestiture 
trustee is appointed, the proposed Final 
Judgment provides that Defendants 
must pay all costs and expenses of the 
trustee. The divestiture trustee’s 
commission must be structured to 
provide an incentive for the trustee 
based on the price obtained and the 
speed with which the divestiture is 
accomplished. After the divestiture 
trustee’s appointment becomes effective, 
the trustee must provide monthly 
reports to the United States and State of 
Texas setting forth his or her efforts to 
accomplish the divestiture. If the 
divestiture has not been accomplished 
within 180 calendar days of the 
divestiture trustee’s appointment, the 
United States may make 
recommendations to the Court, which 
will enter such orders as appropriate, to 
carry out the purpose of the Final 
Judgment, including by extending the 
term of the divestiture trustee’s 
appointment by a period requested by 
the United States. 
B. Other Provisions To Ensure 
Compliance 
The proposed Final Judgment also 
contains provisions designed to promote 
compliance with and make enforcement 
of the Final Judgment as effective as 
possible. Paragraph XIV.A provides that 
the United States and the State of Texas 
retain and reserve all rights to enforce 
the Final Judgment, including the right 
to seek an order of contempt from the 
Court. Under the terms of this 
paragraph, Defendants have agreed that 
in any civil contempt action, any 
motion to show cause, or any similar 
action brought by the United States or 
the State of Texas regarding an alleged 
violation of the Final Judgment, the 
United States or the State of Texas may 
establish the violation and the 
appropriateness of any remedy by a 
preponderance of the evidence and that 
Defendants have waived any argument 
that a different standard of proof should 
apply. This provision aligns the 
standard for compliance with the Final 
Judgment with the standard of proof 
that applies to the underlying offense 
that the Final Judgment addresses. 
Paragraph XIV.B provides additional 
clarification regarding the interpretation 
of the provisions of the proposed Final 
Judgment. The proposed Final Judgment 
is intended to remedy the loss of 
competition the United States and the 
State of Texas allege would otherwise 
result from the Acquisition. Defendants 
agree that they will abide by the 
proposed Final Judgment and that they 
may be held in contempt of the Court 
for failing to comply with any provision 
of the proposed Final Judgment that is 
stated specifically and in reasonable 
detail, as interpreted in light of this 
procompetitive purpose. 
Paragraph XIV.C provides that, if the 
Court finds in an enforcement 
proceeding that a Defendant has 
violated the Final Judgment, the United 
States may apply to the Court for an 
extension of the Final Judgment, 
together with such other relief as may be 
appropriate. In addition, to compensate 
American taxpayers for any costs 
associated with investigating and 
enforcing violations of the Final 
Judgment, Paragraph XIV.C provides 
that, in any successful effort by the 
United States or the State of Texas to 
enforce the Final Judgment against a 
Defendant, whether litigated or resolved 
before litigation, the Defendant must 
reimburse the United States and the 
State of Texas for attorneys’ fees, 
experts’ fees, and other costs incurred in 
connection with that effort to enforce 
the Final Judgment, including the 
investigation of the potential violation. 
Paragraph XIV.D states that the 
United States may file an action against 
a Defendant for violating the Final 
Judgment for up to four years after the 
Final Judgment has expired or been 
terminated. This provision is meant to 
address circumstances such as when 
evidence that a violation of the Final 
Judgment occurred during the term of 
the Final Judgment is not discovered 
until after the Final Judgment has 
expired or been terminated or when 
there is not sufficient time for the 
United States to complete an 
investigation of an alleged violation 
until after the Final Judgment has 
expired or been terminated. This 
provision, therefore, makes clear that, 
for four years after the Final Judgment 
has expired or been terminated, the 
United States may still challenge a 
violation that occurred during the term 
of the Final Judgment. 
Finally, Section XV of the proposed 
Final Judgment provides that the Final 
Judgment will expire ten years from the 
date of its entry, except that after five 
years from the date of its entry, the Final 
Judgment may be terminated upon 
notice by the United States to the Court, 
Defendants and the State of Texas that 
the divestitures have been completed 
and continuation of the Final Judgment 
is no longer necessary or in the public 
interest.

Private Plaintiffs 
Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 
U.S.C. 15, provides that any person who 
has been injured as a result of conduct 
prohibited by the antitrust laws may 
bring suit in federal court to recover 
three times the damages the person has 
suffered, as well as costs and reasonable 
attorneys’ fees. Entry of the proposed 
Final Judgment neither impairs nor 
assists the bringing of any private 
antitrust damage action. Under the 
provisions of Section 5(a) of the Clayton 
Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(a), the proposed Final 
Judgment has no prima facie effect in 
any subsequent private lawsuit that may 
be brought against Defendants. 
V. Procedures Available for 
Modification of the Proposed Final 
Judgment 
The United States and Defendants 
have stipulated that the proposed Final 
Judgment may be entered by the Court 
after compliance with the provisions of 
the APPA, provided that the United 
States has not withdrawn its consent. 
The APPA conditions entry upon the 
Court’s determination that the proposed 
Final Judgment is in the public interest. 
The APPA provides a period of at 
least 60 days preceding the effective 
date of the proposed Final Judgment 
within which any person may submit to 
the United States written comments 
regarding the proposed Final Judgment. 
Any person who wishes to comment 
should do so within 60 days of the date 
of publication of this Competitive 
Impact Statement in the Federal 
Register, or within 60 days of the first 
date of publication in a newspaper of 
the summary of this Competitive Impact 
Statement, whichever is later. All 
comments received during this period 
will be considered by the U.S. 
Department of Justice, which remains 
free to withdraw its consent to the 
proposed Final Judgment at any time 
before the Court’s entry of the Final 
Judgment. The comments and the 
response of the United States will be 
filed with the Court. In addition, the 
comments and the United States’ 
responses will be published in the 
Federal Register unless the Court agrees 
that the United States instead may 
publish them on the U.S. Department of 
Justice, Antitrust Division’s internet 
website. 
Written comments should be 
submitted in English to: Patricia C. 
Corcoran, Acting Chief, Transportation, 
Energy & Agriculture Section, Antitrust 
Division, United States Department of 
Justice, 450 Fifth St. NW, Suite 8000, 
Washington, DC 20530, ATR.Public- 
Comments-Tunney-Act-MB@usdoj.gov. The proposed Final Judgment 
provides that the Court retains 
jurisdiction over this action, and the 
parties may apply to the Court for any 
order necessary or appropriate for the 
modification, interpretation, or 
enforcement of the Final Judgment. 
VI. Alternatives to the Proposed Final 
Judgment 
As an alternative to the proposed 
Final Judgment, the United States 
considered a full trial on the merits 
against Defendants. The United States 
could have pursued litigation and 
sought preliminary and permanent 
injunctions against the Acquisition. The 
United States is satisfied, however, that 
the relief required by the proposed Final 
Judgment will remedy the 
anticompetitive effects alleged in the 
Complaint, preserving competition in 
the markets for wholesale electricity in 
ERCOT and PJM’s Coastal Mid-Atlantic 
area. Thus, the proposed Final Judgment 
achieves all or substantially all of the 
relief the United States would have 
obtained through litigation but avoids 
the time, expense, and uncertainty of a 
full trial on the merits. 
VII. Standard of Review Under the 
APPA for the Proposed Final Judgment 
Under the Clayton Act and APPA, 
proposed Final Judgments, or ‘‘consent 
decrees,’’ in antitrust cases brought by 
the United States are subject to a 60-day 
comment period, after which the Court 
shall determine whether entry of the 
proposed Final Judgment ‘‘is in the 
public interest.’’ 15 U.S.C. 16(e)(1). In 
making that determination, the Court, in 
accordance with the statute as amended 
in 2004, is required to consider: 
(A) the competitive impact of such 
judgment, including termination of alleged 
violations, provisions for enforcement and 
modification, duration of relief sought, 
anticipated effects of alternative remedies 
actually considered, whether its terms are 
ambiguous, and any other competitive 
considerations bearing upon the adequacy of 
such judgment that the court deems 
necessary to a determination of whether the 
consent judgment is in the public interest; 
and 
(B) the impact of entry of such judgment 
upon competition in the relevant market or 
markets, upon the public generally and 
individuals alleging specific injury from the 
violations set forth in the complaint 
including consideration of the public benefit, 
if any, to be derived from a determination of 
the issues at trial. 
15 U.S.C. 16(e)(1)(A) & (B). In 
considering these statutory factors, the 
Court’s inquiry is necessarily a limited 
one, as the government is entitled to 
‘‘broad discretion to settle with the 
defendant within the reaches of the 
public interest.’’ United States v. 
Microsoft Corp., 56 F.3d 1448, 1461 
(D.C. Cir. 1995); United States v. U.S. Airways Grp., Inc., 38 F. Supp. 3d 69, 
75 (D.D.C. 2014) (explaining that the 
‘‘court’s inquiry is limited’’ in Tunney 
Act settlements); United States v. InBev N.V./S.A., No. 08–1965 (JR), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84787, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 
11, 2009) (noting that a court’s review 
of a proposed Final Judgment is limited 
and only inquires ‘‘into whether the 
government’s determination that the 
proposed remedies will cure the 
antitrust violations alleged in the 
complaint was reasonable, and whether 
the mechanisms to enforce the final 
judgment are clear and manageable’’). 
As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia Circuit has held, 
under the APPA, a court considers, 
among other things, the relationship 
between the remedy secured and the 
specific allegations in the government’s 
complaint, whether the proposed Final 
Judgment is sufficiently clear, whether 
its enforcement mechanisms are 
sufficient, and whether it may positively 
harm third parties. See Microsoft, 56 
F.3d at 1458–62. With respect to the 
adequacy of the relief secured by the 
proposed Final Judgment, a court may 
not ‘‘make de novo determination of 
facts and issues.’’ United States v. W. Elec. Co., 993 F.2d 1572, 1577 (D.C. Cir. 
1993) (quotation marks omitted); see 
also Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1460–62; 
United States v. Alcoa, Inc., 152 F. Supp. 2d 37, 40 (D.D.C. 2001); United 
States v. Enova Corp., 107 F. Supp. 2d 10, 16 (D.D.C. 2000); InBev, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84787, at *3. Instead, ‘‘[t]he 
balancing of competing social and 
political interests affected by a proposed 
antitrust decree must be left, in the first 
instance, to the discretion of the 
Attorney General.’’ W. Elec. Co., 993 
F.2d at 1577 (quotation marks omitted). 
‘‘The court should also bear in mind the 
flexibility of the public interest inquiry: the court’s function is not to determine 
whether the resulting array of rights and 
liabilities is the one that will best serve society, but only to confirm that the 
resulting settlement is within the 
reaches of the public interest.’’ Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1460 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) 
(emphases in original); see also United 
States v. Deutsche Telekom AG, No. 19– 2232 (TJK), 2020 WL 1873555, at *7 
(D.D.C. Apr. 14, 2020). More demanding 
requirements would ‘‘have enormous 
practical consequences for the 
government’s ability to negotiate future 
settlements,’’ contrary to congressional 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:49 Dec 17, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00134 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\18DEN1.SGM 18DEN1
lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159223 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices intent. Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1456. ‘‘The Tunney Act was not intended to create 
a disincentive to the use of the consent 
decree.’’ Id. The United States’ predictions about 
the efficacy of the remedy are to be 
afforded deference by the Court. See, 
e.g., Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1461 
(recognizing courts should give ‘‘due 
respect to the Justice Department’s . . . 
view of the nature of its case’’); United 
States v. Iron Mountain, Inc., 217 F. Supp. 3d 146, 152–53 (D.D.C. 2016) (‘‘In 
evaluating objections to settlement 
agreements under the Tunney Act, a 
court must be mindful that [t]he 
government need not prove that the 
settlements will perfectly remedy the 
alleged antitrust harms[;] it need only 
provide a factual basis for concluding 
that the settlements are reasonably 
adequate remedies for the alleged 
harms.’’ (internal citations omitted)); 
United States v. Republic Servs., Inc., 723 F. Supp. 2d 157, 160 (D.D.C. 2010) 
(noting ‘‘the deferential review to which 
the government’s proposed remedy is 
accorded’’); United States v. Archer- Daniels-Midland Co., 272 F. Supp. 2d 1, 
6 (D.D.C. 2003) (‘‘A district court must 
accord due respect to the government’s 
prediction as to the effect of proposed 
remedies, its perception of the market 
structure, and its view of the nature of 
the case.’’). The ultimate question is 
whether ‘‘the remedies [obtained by the 
Final Judgment are] so inconsonant with 
the allegations charged as to fall outside 
of the ‘reaches of the public interest.’ ’’ 
Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1461 (quoting W. Elec. Co., 900 F.2d at 309). 
Moreover, the Court’s role under the 
APPA is limited to reviewing the 
remedy in relationship to the violations 
that the United States has alleged in its 
Complaint and does not authorize the 
Court to ‘‘construct [its] own 
hypothetical case and then evaluate the 
decree against that case.’’ Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1459; see also U.S. Airways, 38 
F. Supp. 3d at 75 (noting that the court 
must simply determine whether there is 
a factual foundation for the 
government’s decisions such that its 
conclusions regarding the proposed 
settlements are reasonable); InBev, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84787, at *20 (‘‘[T]he 
‘public interest’ is not to be measured by 
comparing the violations alleged in the 
complaint against those the court 
believes could have, or even should 
have, been alleged’’). Because the 
‘‘court’s authority to review the decree 
depends entirely on the government’s 
exercising its prosecutorial discretion by 
bringing a case in the first place,’’ it 
follows that ‘‘the court is only 
authorized to review the decree itself,’’ 
and not to ‘‘effectively redraft the 
complaint’’ to inquire into other matters 
that the United States did not pursue. 
Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1459–60. In its 2004 amendments to the APPA, 
Congress made clear its intent to 
preserve the practical benefits of using 
judgments proposed by the United 
States in antitrust enforcement, Public 
Law 108–237 § 221, and added the 
unambiguous instruction that ‘‘[n]othing 
in this section shall be construed to 
require the court to conduct an 
evidentiary hearing or to require the 
court to permit anyone to intervene.’’ 15 
U.S.C. 16(e)(2); see also U.S. Airways, 
38 F. Supp. 3d at 76 (indicating that a 
court is not required to hold an 
evidentiary hearing or to permit 
intervenors as part of its review under 
the Tunney Act). This language 
explicitly wrote into the statute what 
Congress intended when it first enacted 
the Tunney Act in 1974. As Senator 
Tunney explained: ‘‘[t]he court is 
nowhere compelled to go to trial or to 
engage in extended proceedings which 
might have the effect of vitiating the 
benefits of prompt and less costly 
settlement through the consent decree 
process.’’ 119 Cong. Rec. 24,598 (1973) 
(statement of Sen. Tunney). ‘‘A court 
can make its public interest 
determination based on the competitive 
impact statement and response to public 
comments alone.’’ U.S. Airways, 38 F. 
Supp. 3d at 76 (citing Enova Corp., 107 
F. Supp. 2d at 17).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Discussion 
Notice is hereby given that the NRC 
has issued Subsequent Renewed Facility 
Operating License Nos. DPR–19 and 
DPR–25 to CEG for Dresden. CEG is the 
operator of the facilities. Subsequent 
Renewed Facility Operating License 
Nos. DPR–19 and DPR–25 authorize 
operation of Dresden, Units 2 and 3, by 
CEG at reactor core power levels not in 
excess of 2,957 megawatts thermal, in 
accordance with the provisions of the 
Dresden subsequent renewed licenses 
and technical specifications. Notice is 
also given that the ROD that supports 
the NRC’s decision to issue Subsequent 
Renewed Facility Operating License 
Nos. DPR–19 and DPR–25 is available in 
the ‘‘Availability of Documents’’ section 
of this document. 
As discussed in the ROD and the final 
supplemental environmental impact 
statement (SEIS), published as NUREG– 
1437, Supplement 17, Second Renewal, 
‘‘Generic Environmental Impact 
Statement for License Renewal of 
Nuclear Plants: Regarding Subsequent 
License Renewal for Dresden Nuclear 
Power Station, Units 2 and 3, Final 
Report,’’ dated September 2025, the 
final SEIS documents the NRC staff’s 
environmental review, including the 
determination that the adverse 
environmental impacts of subsequent 
license renewal (SLR) for Dresden are 
not so great that preserving the option 
of SLR for energy planning 
decisionmakers would be unreasonable. 
The final SEIS conclusion is based on 
(1) information provided in the 
environmental report submitted by CEG, 
as supplemented, (2) the NRC staff’s 
consultations with Federal, State, local, 
and Tribal agencies, (3) the NRC staff’s 
independent environmental review, and 
(4) the NRC staff’s consideration of 
public comments received during the 
scoping process and on the 2025 draft 
SEIS. 
Dresden is a boiling water reactor site 
located near Morris, Illinois. CEG 
submitted its application for the 
subsequent renewed license, ‘‘Dresden 
Nuclear Power Station, Units 2 and 3— 
Subsequent License Renewal 
Application,’’ on April 17, 2024, as 
supplemented by letters through May 8, 
2025 (see ‘‘Availability of Documents’’ 
section of this document). The NRC staff 
has determined that CEG’s application 
complies with the standards and 
requirements of the Atomic Energy Act 
of 1954, as amended (the Act), and 
NRC’s regulations. As required by the 
Act and NRC regulations in Chapter 1 of 
title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR), the NRC has made appropriate findings, which are set forth 
in the subsequent renewed licenses. 
A public notice of the NRC’s 
acceptance for docketing of the 
subsequent renewed license application 
and an opportunity for a hearing was 
published in the Federal Register on 
June 24, 2024 (89 FR 52514). Further, a 
notice of intent to conduct 
environmental scoping was published 
on August 5, 2024 (89 FR 63450). On 
August 6, 2024, the NRC amended its 
environmental protection regulations by 
updating the Commission’s 2013 
findings on the environmental effects of 
renewing the operating license of a 
nuclear power plant. This final rule 
redefines the number and scope of the 
environmental issues that must be 
addressed during the review of each 
application for license renewal (LR) and 
specifically considers the environmental 
effects of SLR. As part of this update, 
the NRC issued Revision 2 to the LR 
Generic Environmental Impact 
Statement (GEIS) to account for new 
information and to address the impacts 
of initial license renewal as well as one 
20-year period of SLR. The final rule 
became effective for NRC staff on 
September5,2024. On September 9, 
2025, the NRC staff issued its Safety 
Evaluation (SE) concerning the Dresden 
subsequent license renewal application 
(SLRA). In May 2025, the NRC staff 
issued a draft SEIS for public comment, 
providing the preliminary results of the

General collateral, or GC, refers to a set of high- 
quality, liquid security issues, which trade in the 
repo market at the same or a very similar repo rate. 
These security issues can therefore be substituted 
for one another without changing the repo rate. In 
other words, the buyer in a general collateral repo 
is indifferent to which of the general collateral 
securities she will receive. The basket of security 
issues that form a particular general collateral repo 
market belong to the same class (e.g., government bonds) or sub-class (e.g., government bonds with no more than five years remaining to maturity). See 
International Capital Market Association, [FAQ] 8.

The Commission has received no 
comments regarding the substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change. For the 
reasons discussed below, the 
Commission is approving the Proposed 
Rule Change. 
I. Description of the Proposed Rule 
Change 
A. Background 
FICC, through GSD, serves as a central 
counterparty (‘‘CCP’’) and provides real- 
time trade matching, clearing, risk 
management and netting for cash 
purchases and sales and repurchase and 
reverse repurchase transactions 
(‘‘repos’’) involving U.S. Treasury 
securities. Market participants that are 
not direct members of FICC may access 
FICC’s clearing services indirectly 
through a FICC direct member (i.e., 
Netting Member). Through the 
Sponsored Service, one of FICC’s 
indirect participation offerings, FICC 
permits Netting Members, approved 
under the GSD Rules as ‘‘Sponsoring 
Members,’’ to sponsor certain firms, 
referred to as ‘‘Sponsored Members,’’ 
into a limited form of GSD 
membership.
10
A Sponsoring Member is 
permitted to submit to FICC, for 
comparison, novation, and netting, 
certain eligible securities transactions of 
its Sponsored Members. FICC requires 
each Sponsoring Member to establish an 
omnibus account at FICC (separate from 
its regular netting account) for 
Sponsored Member trading activity. For 
operational and administrative 
purposes, a Sponsored Member 
appoints its Sponsoring Member to act 
as processing agent with respect to the 
Sponsored Member’s satisfaction of its 
securities and funds-only settlement 
obligations.
11
 
A Sponsored Member is the legal 
counterparty to FICC for any submitted 
transactions.
12
However, the Sponsoring 
Member unconditionally guarantees to 
FICC the Sponsored Member’s 
performance under a Sponsoring 
Member Guaranty, which guarantees to 
FICC the payment and performance of a 
Sponsored Member’s obligations to 
FICC.
13
Therefore, FICC relies on the 
financial resources of the Sponsoring 
Member as guarantor. 
General collateral
14
triparty repos 
between Sponsoring Members and 
Sponsored Members (i.e., ‘‘done-with’’ trades) are eligible for clearing under 
FICC’s Sponsored GC Service within 
FICC’s Sponsored Service (‘‘Sponsored 
GC Trades’’).
15
After the Start Leg settles 
away from FICC, the End Leg, or the 
concluding Sponsored GC Trade (i.e., 
the ‘‘repurchase’’), is novated to FICC 
and is eligible for netting against all 
other eligible trades of the GSD 
Member.
16
FICC states that, to protect 
against the non-performance of the End 
Leg, certain cash lenders, such as 
registered investment companies 
(‘‘RICs’’), generally charge cash 
borrowers a haircut as additional 
collateral above 100% of the cash value 
lent at settlement of the Start Leg 
(hereinafter ‘‘collateral haircut’’).
17
 
Currently, this haircut is charged away 
from FICC and is distinct from FICC’s 
margin charge.
18
Furthermore, FICC 
charges margin (i.e., the member’s Clearing Fund Requirement) on all 
trades, including any Sponsored GC 
Trades, novated to FICC. 
FICC states that certain market 
participants have identified a number of 
constraints on the ability of RICs and 
other cash providers to access FICC’s 
clearance and settlement services.
19
 
First, Sponsoring Members, who are 
either borrowing cash or intermediating 
the trade on behalf of a cash borrower 
on a done-with basis, currently are 
charged a collateral haircut by the RIC 
or other cash provider, away from 
FICC.
20
Because that collateral haircut 
cannot be on-posted to FICC, 
Sponsoring Members must also pay 
margin to FICC in relation to the cash 
provider’s obligations under the 
Sponsored GC Trade.
21
Second, FICC 
states Sponsoring Members face 
regulatory capital requirements 
associated with providing the 
Sponsoring Member Guaranty on behalf 
of the RICs and other cash providers it 
sponsors into FICC membership, which 
may limit Sponsoring Members’ ability 
to provide clearing services for these 
trades on either a done-with or done- 
away basis.
22
Third, FICC understands 
certain RICs and other cash providers 
may face operational constraints on 
making or receiving Funds-Only 
Settlement Amount payments twice 
daily; therefore, it is common practice 
for the Sponsoring Member to agree to 
pay the amounts due on behalf of the 
Sponsored Member.
23
Fourth, there are 
timing constraints around allocations 
that limit a Sponsoring Member’s ability 
to submit to FICC triparty repo 
transactions entered into through joint 
trading accounts, as detailed below.
24
 
Additionally, market participants have 
expressed interest in being able to clear 
‘‘done-away’’ Sponsored GC Trades 
between the Sponsored Member and 
either a Netting Member other than the 
Sponsoring Member or another Indirect 
Participant of any Netting Member.

29
FICC states that by proposing the CIL Service 
under its existing Sponsored GC Service, it would 
leverage much of the legal and operational 
framework applicable to the existing Sponsored GC 
Service, including the process for trade submission, 
the use of Generic CUSIP Numbers, and the process 
for settling the transactions through the triparty 
platform of the Sponsored GC Clearing Agent Bank. 
See Notice of Filing, supra note 4, at 44409. 30
See id. at 44411. 
31
See id. at 44411–12. 
32
See id. at 44412. 
33
FICC states that this instruction right is 
consistent with the Sponsored GC Service in which 
the cash borrower is generally entitled to the return 
of excess margin. Such excess would generally arise 
due to an increase in the market value of the 
Purchased GC Repo Securities since the Sponsored 
GC CIL Trade was executed. See Notice of Filing, supra note 4, at 44412. 34
The GC Funds Borrower would be entitled to 
effectuate, and a CIL Funds Lender would be 
required to process, a substitution for some or all 
of the Purchased GC Repo Securities of the same 
Generic CUSIP Number. 
35
The lien would be documented in a ‘‘CIL 
Custodial Agreement Supplement’’ between a 
Sponsored GC Clearing Agent Bank, a CIL Funds 
Lender, FICC, and the GC Funds Borrower. The 
Rules would require that each CIL Custodial 
Agreement Supplement include, at a minimum, the 
terms set forth in the Rules and no terms 
inconsistent with such terms. The CIL Custodial 
Agreement Supplement would supplement the 
existing custodial undertaking or similar agreement 
(‘‘Custody Agreement’’) governing the account in 
which the Sponsored GC Clearing Agent Bank 
maintains the Purchased GC Repo Securities for the 
CIL Funds Lender (‘‘Buyer’s GC CIL Trade 
Account’’). See Notice of Filing, supra note 4, at 44412.

38
See id. 
B. Proposed Changes
26
 
FICC proposes two sets of changes to 
address these issues. First, FICC 
proposes to expand its Sponsored 
Service to add a new Collateral-in-Lieu 
offering to its Sponsored GC Service, in 
which FICC will take a lien on the 
collateral in lieu of charging margin. 
The lien on collateral generally will 
obviate FICC’s need to collect margin or 
the Funds Only Settlement Amount 
payments and to obtain the Sponsoring 
Member Guaranty on these trades.
27
 
Second, FICC proposes to allow a 
Sponsoring Member to submit for 
clearance and settlement a ‘‘done-away’’ 
Sponsored GC Trade. As discussed 
further below, the purpose of this 
expansion is to facilitate access to 
central clearing for market participants, 
particularly RICs including money 
market funds and other cash 
providers.
28
 
1. Expand the Sponsored GC Service for 
a New Collateral-in-Lieu Offering (‘‘CIL 
Service’’) 
CIL Service Offering 
Under the proposed CIL Service, a 
Sponsoring Member would be eligible to 
submit to FICC for clearance and 
settlement a GC triparty repo 
(‘‘Sponsored GC CIL Trade’’) entered 
into by its Sponsored Member as cash 
provider (‘‘CIL Funds Lender’’).
29
FICC 
proposes that Sponsored GC CIL Trades 
would be recorded in a new type of 
Indirect Participants Account, called a 
‘‘Sponsored GC CIL Omnibus Account.’’ 
FICC states the reason for the separate 
Sponsored GC CIL Omnibus Account is 
that the margin requirements for 
Sponsored GC CIL Trades would be 
calculated differently from those for 
general Sponsored Member Trades.
30
In 
addition, since one of the principal 
purposes of the CIL Service is to address 
the inability of CIL Funds Lenders to 
post margin, and the margin for 
Segregated Indirect Participants 
Accounts must generally consist of 
Indirect Participant assets, the Rules 
would not permit a Sponsored GC CIL 
Omnibus Account to be a Segregated 
Indirect Participants Account.
31
 
Risk Management Under New CIL 
Service 
FICC proposes to require each CIL 
Funds Lender to collect a haircut and to 
grant FICC a lien on the Purchased GC 
Repo Securities subject to the 
Sponsored GC CIL Trade. FICC states 
that the purpose of the lien would be to 
allow FICC to acquire the Purchased GC 
Repo Securities and use them to settle 
with the GC Funds Borrower in the 
event FICC ceases to act for the CIL 
Funds Lender or its Sponsoring 
Member.
32
FICC proposes to amend the 
Rules to provide that if FICC ceases to 
act for a CIL Funds Lender, FICC may, 
in lieu of closing out the Sponsored GC 
CIL Trades (or a portion of any such 
trades), exercise its right as a secured 
party in relation to the Purchased GC 
Repo Securities and instruct the 
Sponsored GC Clearing Agent Bank to 
remove such Purchased GC Repo 
Securities from the account of such CIL 
Funds Lender. 
Once FICC ceases to act for a CIL 
Funds Lender, FICC would only be 
permitted, under the GSD Rules, to 
instruct the Sponsored GC Clearing 
Agent Bank to remove the Purchased GC 
Repo Securities from the account of the 
CIL Funds Lender in two scenarios. 
First, FICC would be able to remove 
such securities if such removal is 
against cash in an amount equal to the 
amount payable to the CIL Funds 
Lender (i.e., against the repurchase price due back to the CIL Funds Lender in 
final settlement of the Sponsored GC 
CIL Trade). Second, FICC would be able 
to remove the amount of Purchased GC 
Repo Securities necessary to satisfy the 
CIL Funds Lender’s obligation to return 
excess Purchased GC Repo Securities
33
 
or to return Purchased GC Repo 
Securities for which the GC Funds 
Borrower has exercised its right to make 
a substitution.
34
 
To ensure that the Sponsored GC 
Clearing Agent Bank acts on such 
instructions and to perfect FICC’s 
security interest in the Purchased GC 
Repo Securities, the CIL Custodial 
Agreement Supplement would contain 
an agreement by the Sponsored GC 
Clearing Agent Bank to comply with 
FICC’s instructions except following 
delivery by the CIL Funds Lender to the 
Sponsored GC Clearing Agent Bank of a 
notice of a Corporation Default (a ‘‘GC 
CIL Notice of Default’’).
35
FICC states 
the reason the Sponsored GC Clearing 
Agent Bank would agree not to act on 
FICC’s instructions following the 
delivery by the CIL Funds Lender of a 
CIL GC Notice of Default is to ensure 
that, the CIL Funds Lender would be 
able to exercise remedies against the 
Purchased GC Repo Securities promptly 
upon a Corporation Default without 
potential competing instructions from 
FICC.
36
 
FICC states that the lien on the 
Purchased GC Repo Securities generally 
will obviate FICC’s need to collect 
margin or the Funds Only Settlement 
Amount payments and to obtain the 
Sponsoring Member Guaranty on these 
trades.
37
In the context of a reverse 
repurchase transaction (‘‘reverse repo’’), 
FICC collects margin to ensure that it 
has sufficient resources in the event it 
ceases to act for the reverse repo buyer 
or its Sponsoring Member, to purchase 
the relevant securities and deliver them 
to the non-defaulting pre-Novation 
counterparty.
38
However, if FICC can 
acquire the securities without taking 
market action by virtue of a lien on such 
securities, FICC states that it would not

See id. 
40
See id. 
41
See id. For example, if the GC Funds Borrower 
is an Indirect Participant of the defaulting 
Sponsoring Member and the Sponsoring Member’s 
trustee or bankruptcy receiver refuses to perform its 
obligation as processing agent for such Indirect 
Participant to complete settlement, FICC would not 
be able to settle. See Notice of Filing, supra note 4, at 44413. 
42
See id. For instance, if the Sponsoring Member 
were the GC Funds Borrower but entered into a 
back-to-back FICC-cleared transaction involving 
some of the Purchased GC Repo Securities with a 
Netting Member or an Indirect Participant of a third 
party Netting Member, the Sponsoring Member’s 
obligations would net out, and FICC would not? be 
able to complete settlement with the Sponsoring 
Member’s pre-Novation counterparty on the back- 
to-back transaction. 
43
In furtherance of the foregoing, the CIL 
Custodial Agreement Supplement would permit the 
CIL Funds Lender to instruct the Sponsored GC 
Clearing Agent Bank in relation to any Purchased 
GC Repo Securities that FICC has informed the 
Sponsored GC Clearing Agent Bank FICC does not 
intend to use to complete settlement with the 
relevant GC Funds Borrower. 
44
To the extent the Sponsoring Member posted 
Clearing Fund to secure the obligations of the GC 
Funds Borrower, that Clearing Fund could serve as 
such resources. Accordingly, FICC proposes to 
amend the Rules to allow it to look to such Clearing 
Fund deposits to address a CIL Funds Lender’s 
obligations in the event FICC closes out the 
Sponsored GC CIL Trades. However, if the GC 
Funds Borrower is an Indirect Participant that has 
posted Segregated Customer Margin, such margin 
would only be available to cover the GC Funds 
Borrower’s obligations and could not be used to 
address the obligations of a CIL Funds Lender. FICC 
would therefore require other resources to cover 
such liquidation amount. See Notice of Filing, supra note 4, at 44413. 45
See id. 
46
FICC states this would only occur in situations 
where (1) the Sponsored GC CIL Omnibus Account 
has been enabled to record Sponsored GC CIL 
Trades for which the GC Funds Borrower is its 
Sponsoring Member or a Segregated Indirect 
Participant of its Sponsoring Member; and (2) that 
Sponsoring Member or its Affiliate has a Segregated 
Indirect Participants Account. See id. 
47
In addition to the VaR Charge, the Sponsored 
GC CIL Omnibus Account Required Fund Deposit

Liquidity Adjustment Charge and Intraday 
Supplemental Deposit. See GSD Margin Component Schedule, supra note 3. 48

See GSD Rule 22A Section 2a(b), supra note 3. need margin to secure the CIL Funds 
Lender’s obligations because FICC 
would generally be able to settle with 
the GC Funds Borrower and CIL Funds 
Lender even if FICC ceased to act for the 
CIL Funds Lender’s Sponsoring 
Member.
39
 
FICC states that, nonetheless, certain 
limited circumstances could prevent 
FICC from effectuating such settlement, 
namely, if the GC Funds Borrower on 
the Sponsored GC CIL Trade is the 
defaulting Sponsoring Member or an 
Indirect Participant of that Sponsoring 
Member or its Affiliate.
40
In such a 
default scenario, FICC may not be able 
to settle the Sponsored GC CIL Trade at 
all.
41
In other cases, FICC may be able 
to complete only partial settlement 
notwithstanding the fact that it has 
ceased to act for the Sponsoring 
Member.
42
 
To address these possibilities, FICC 
proposes to provide that, if FICC ceases 
to act for the Sponsoring Member, and 
the GC Funds Borrower is the defaulting 
Sponsoring Member or one of its 
Indirect Participants, FICC may, as an 
alternative to effectuating settlement or 
exercising rights under its lien, 
terminate the Sponsored GC CIL Trade 
(or portion thereof). In that situation, the 
CIL Funds Lender would be permitted 
to take such market action in relation to 
the relevant Purchased GC Repo 
Securities as it determines in its 
discretion.
43
Were FICC to terminate a 
Sponsored GC CIL Trade (or a portion 
thereof), FICC would calculate a 
liquidation amount owing in respect 
thereof pursuant to GSD Rule 22A. If the 
liquidation amount is owed by the CIL 
Funds Lender to FICC, FICC would 
require resources to ensure the CIL 
Funds Lender can satisfy its obligation 
to pay such amount.
44
 
FICC proposes to address such need 
for additional resources in two ways. 
First, FICC proposes to require that a 
Sponsored GC CIL Trade have an Initial 
Haircut no less than 2 percent of the 
Contract Value of the Start Leg or such 
other amount determined by FICC (‘‘CIL 
Required Haircut’’). FICC states that this 
requirement would be broadly 
consistent with the market practice of 
how uncleared triparty repos of RICs are 
overcollateralized today.
45
FICC would 
provide Netting Members with at least 
30 Business Days’ advance notice of any 
changes to the CIL Required Haircut. 
Second, FICC proposes to subject the 
CIL Funds Lender’s Sponsoring Member 
to a Clearing Fund requirement for a 
Sponsored GC CIL Omnibus Account 
(‘‘Sponsored GC CIL Omnibus Account 
Required Fund Deposit’’) when 
necessary to ensure that FICC would 
have resources, in the form of Clearing 
Fund deposits or Purchased GC Repo 
Securities, no less than the Clearing 
Fund FICC would otherwise collect in 
relation to the transaction.
46
 
The Sponsored GC CIL Omnibus 
Account Required Fund Deposit would 
be the greater of a $1 million minimum 
and the sum of all applicable charges, 
with margin calculated in the same 
manner as when calculated with respect 
to a Sponsoring Member Omnibus 
Account. The VaR Charge would be 
calculated for each CIL Funds Lender as 
the positive difference between (1) the 
amount of VaR Charge that FICC would 
have collected if the Sponsored GC CIL 
Trades of that CIL Funds Lender had 
been subject to the calculation of a 
Sponsoring Member Omnibus Account 
Required Fund Deposit, and (2) the 
aggregate of all CIL Required Haircuts 
on that CIL Funds Lender’s Sponsored 
GC CIL Trades.
47
 
FICC states that its security interest in 
Purchased GC Repo Securities subject to 
Sponsored GC CIL Trades would also 
generally remove the need for the 
Sponsoring Member to guarantee to 
FICC the performance by the CIL Funds 
Lender of its obligations under the 
Sponsored GC CIL Trades, since FICC’s 
lien generally would allow it to obtain 
the Purchased GC Repo Securities and 
perform to the GC Funds Borrower.
48
 
Accordingly, FICC proposes to amend 
the Rules to provide that, 
notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary set forth in any Sponsoring 
Member Guaranty, the Sponsoring 
Member does not guarantee to FICC and, 
except as expressly set forth in the 
Rules, shall not be responsible for, the 
obligations of a Sponsored Member 
arising under any Sponsored GC CIL 
Trade for which the Sponsored Member 
is the CIL Funds Lender. 
Because FICC would generally 
anticipate addressing a CIL Funds 
Lender default by utilizing the lien to 
settle with the GC Funds Borrower, 
FICC proposes to amend Section 16 of 
Rule 3A, which generally allows a 
Sponsoring Member to liquidate a done- 
with Sponsored Member Trade,
49
to 
provide that a Sponsoring Member may 
only trigger that provision if FICC has 
not exercised its rights as a secured 
party. In addition, FICC is proposing to 
amend the GSD Rules to provide that, in 
the event that the Sponsoring Member 
did exercise its rights to terminate any 
done-with Sponsored GC CIL Trades, 
the Sponsoring Member would be 
responsible for any Sponsored Member 
Liquidation Amount owed by the CIL 
Funds Lender. 
FICC states that the CIL Service would 
not present additional or new liquidity 
risks to FICC.
50
FICC would incorporate 
Sponsored GC CIL Trades into its 
liquidity risk management calculations 
and the calculation of Sponsoring 
Members’ obligations for the Capped 
Contingency Liquidity Facility 
(‘‘CCLF’’), using the same methodology, 
logic and parameters that FICC uses 
with respect to Sponsored GC Trades.

Service, the only Funds-Only

FICC states that the Forward Mark Adjustment 
Payment captures the loss or gain to FICC and the 
defaulting pre-Novation counterparty of such 
greater or lower costs and thereby ensures that FICC 
and the pre-Novation counterparty are made whole 
in the event FICC ceases to act for the pre-Novation 
counterparty. See Notice of Filing, supra note 4, at 44418. 
53
FICC states that the Interest Adjustment 
Payment serves to compensate the payer of the 
Forward Mark Adjustment Payment for the time 
value of the payment. See id. 
54
See id. 
55
See id. 
56
FICC states it would still collect Funds-Only 
Settlement Amounts from the GC Funds Borrower 
in relation to the Sponsored GC CIL Trade because, 
in the event the GC Funds Borrower (or its 
Sponsoring Member or Agent Clearing Member, as 
applicable) defaults, FICC might need to enter into 
a replacement transaction to perform to the CIL 
Funds Lender. However, FICC would not pay 
Funds-Only Settlement Amounts to the GC Funds 
Borrower because FICC would not be collecting 
such amounts from the CIL Funds Lender. See id.

If FICC determines that its exercise of remedies 
would have a significant adverse impact on the 
interest of any non-defaulting CIL Funds Lender 
(e.g., if the CIL Joint Account Block has not been allocated), then FICC would refrain from exercising 
its remedies against the CIL Funds Lender in 
relation to such CIL Joint Account Block or 
Purchase GC Repo Securities, including its rights 
under its security interest in the Purchased GC 
Repo Securities, as long as it determines that such 
non-action is allowed, and would not prejudice its 
rights under, applicable law and is necessary to 
preserve the interest of any non-defaulting CIL 
Funds Lenders. In this scenario, the only actions 
FICC would take would be to (1) facilitate the 
movement of an Margin Excess Amount or (2) cause 
the transfer of the Purchased GC Repo Securities 
against the amount due under the CIL Joint Account 
Block. See Notice of Filing, supra note 4, at 44417. Settlement Amounts that the pre- 
Novation counterparties to a Sponsored 
GC Trade are obligated to pay to FICC 
and entitled to receive from FICC are the 
Forward Mark Adjustment Payment
52
 
and Interest Adjustment Payment.
53
 
FICC exchanges such amounts with the 
pre-Novation counterparties to address 
the risk that the pre-Novation 
counterparty (or its Sponsoring Member 
or Agent Clearing Member, as 
applicable) defaults and FICC needs to 
enter into a replacement transaction at 
market interest rates, which may have 
changed since the date of Novation, in 
order to perform to the other pre- 
Novation counterparty.
54
 
According to FICC, in the context of 
the CIL Service, FICC’s lien on the 
Purchased GC Repo Securities and 
ability to instruct the Sponsored GC 
Clearing Agent Bank to transfer such 
securities would effectively ensure that 
FICC never needs to enter into a 
replacement transaction to address the 
default of a CIL Funds Lender (or its 
Sponsoring Member). Rather, FICC 
would rely upon its lien and instruction 
right to settle with the GC Funds 
Borrower or, if the GC Funds Borrower 
is the Sponsoring Member or its Indirect 
Participant, possibly terminate both the 
transaction with the CIL Funds Lender 
and GC Funds Borrower such that no 
replacement transaction is required.
55
 
FICC is therefore proposing for FICC not 
to pay or collect Funds-Only Settlement 
Amounts to or from a CIL Funds Lender 
(or its Sponsoring Member) in relation 
to a Sponsored GC CIL Trade.
56
FICC 
states that, in turn, this change would 
facilitate the ability of RICs and other 
cash providers to access FICC’s 
clearance and settlement services 
because, without the need for these 
obligations, Sponsoring Members would 
have more capacity and therefore could 
be better able provide access to 
clearance and settlement services for 
these indirect participants.
57
 
Joint Trading Accounts Under the CIL 
Service 
FICC states that RICs and other cash 
providers that have engaged a common 
investment adviser may seek to enter 
into triparty repo transactions using 
joint trading accounts.
58
The investment 
adviser acts as agent for the joint trading 
account, and the obligations of the 
investment adviser and a cash provider 
in relation to the joint trading account 
are typically set out in an agreement 
between the investment adviser and the 
cash provider.
59
 
FICC states that one of the obligations 
of an investment adviser that acts on 
behalf of a joint trading account is to 
‘‘allocate’’ transactions entered into 
through the joint trading account to the 
individual participants.
60
The allocation 
serves to cause the transaction to 
constitute separate individual 
transactions between the counterparty 
and each participant based on the 
participant’s allocated portion.
61
 
However, prior to such allocation, the 
transaction remains a single transaction, 
with each participant having a pro rata 
interest in it and being liable for a pro 
rata share of the obligations.
62
 
Regardless of whether a transaction has 
been allocated, each participant’s 
entitlement to the purchased securities 
in the triparty account corresponds to 
its portion of the relevant transaction. 
To facilitate the ability of CIL Funds 
Lenders to access FICC’s clearance and 
settlement systems in relation to 
transactions executed through a joint 
trading account, FICC proposes to 
permit two or more CIL Funds Lenders 
to be represented by an agent (a ‘‘CIL 
Joint Account Agent’’) that has been 
approved by FICC. Each such CIL Funds 
Lender and CIL Joint Account Agent 
would need to sign and deliver to FICC 
a ‘‘CIL Joint Account Agent Agreement’’ 
in such form as may be prescribed by 
FICC. FICC further proposes to amend 
its Rules to permit a Sponsoring 
Member to submit to FICC for Novation 
a Sponsored GC CIL Trade entered into 
by a CIL Joint Account Agent on behalf 
of multiple CIL Funds Lenders (each 
such Sponsored GC CIL Trade, a ‘‘CIL 
Joint Account Block’’). 
Each such CIL Funds Lender on 
whose behalf a CIL Joint Account Block 
has been submitted would only be 
entitled to, and liable for, its respective 
portion of the rights and obligations 
arising under or in connection with the 
CIL Joint Account Block. The GSD Rules 
would provide that, if the CIL Joint 
Account Agent has performed such 
allocation, the entitlement of each CIL 
Funds Lender to, and liability of each 
such CIL Funds Lender for, the rights 
and obligations arising under or in 
connection with such CIL Joint Account 
Block shall be limited to the amount of 
such CIL Joint Account Block allocated 
to each such CIL Funds Lender. If the 
CIL Joint Account Agent has not 
performed such allocation, the CIL 
Funds Lender would be liable for its pro 
rata portion of the transaction. 
FICC proposes to provide in the GSD 
Rules that, in a default of a CIL Funds 
Lender on whose behalf a CIL Joint 
Account Block has been submitted, 
FICC would, to the extent it determines 
doing so is feasible and consistent with 
applicable law, exercise remedies in a 
way that would have no significant 
adverse impact on the interest of any 
non-defaulting CIL Funds Lender in 
such CIL Joint Account Block or the 
Purchased GC Repo Securities related 
thereto.
63
As discussed above, in 
relation to a defaulting CIL Funds 
Lender, such exercise would constitute 
an exercise of remedies as a secured 
party. In relation to any non-defaulting 
CIL Funds Lender, such exercise of 
remedies would constitute settlement of 
its portion of the CIL Joint Account 
Block in relation to mark-to-market, 
substitution, or final settlement 
obligations with respect thereto. 
In order to ensure that FICC knows 
the respective interests of the defaulting 
and non-defaulting CIL Funds Lenders 
in a CIL Joint Account Block, FICC 
proposes to require that a CIL Joint 
Account Agent provide FICC with 
certain information in the event FICC 
ceases to act for a CIL Funds Lender on 
whose behalf a CIL Joint Account Agent 
acts. In particular, the Rules would

compliance-dates.pdf (describing ‘‘margin issues associated with registered funds’ Treasury repo

provide that, in the event FICC ceases to 
act for a CIL Funds Lender that is a 
participant in a CIL Joint Account 
Block, the relevant CIL Joint Account 
Agent must promptly notify FICC 
whether such CIL Joint Account Block 
had been allocated and, if so, the 
respective allocation to the defaulting 
CIL Funds Lender. The Rules would 
further provide that the CIL Joint 
Account Agent would not be permitted 
to change the allocation information 
with respect to the defaulting CIL Funds 
Lender following such notification. 
FICC does not propose to require the 
CIL Joint Account Agent to provide 
allocation information outside the 
context of a default by a CIL Funds 
Lender because, in light of FICC’s lien 
on the Purchased GC Repo Securities 
and instruction right, FICC does not 
require such information to risk manage 
the Sponsored GC CIL Trade or to 
effectuate settlement thereof.
64
 
2. Expand the Sponsored GC Service To 
Allow for ‘‘Done-Away’’ Trades 
Currently, a Sponsoring Member may 
submit only done-with transactions to 
FICC under the Sponsored GC Service.
65
 
FICC proposes to amend its Rules to 
permit a Sponsoring Member to submit 
to FICC for clearing under the existing 
Sponsored GC Service done-away 
transactions. FICC is proposing to 
effectuate this change by revising a 
number of defined terms and certain 
sections in Rule 3A to make clear that 
counterparties to a Sponsored GC Trade 
do not need to be a Sponsored Member 
and its Sponsoring Member, but instead 
can be a Sponsored Member and any 
Netting Member or its Indirect 
Participant. FICC states that allowing for 
the submission of done-away 
transactions should facilitate greater 
access by allowing a Sponsored Member 
to submit more of their eligible 
secondary market transactions and to do 
so without entering into clearing 
agreements with each of their execution 
counterparties.
66
 
FICC states that its risk management 
and liquidity requirements in respect of 
done-away Sponsored GC Trades would 
not be different from those in respect of 
other done-away sponsored trades.
67
 
Done-away Sponsored GC Trades would 
be subject to all applicable requirements 
as done-with Sponsored GC Trades. 
Furthermore, as with existing 
Sponsored Member Trades, the 
liquidation provision in the GSD Rules 
would only be applicable to done-with 
Sponsored GC Trades.
68
 
In connection with this proposed 
change, FICC is also proposing to extend 
the deadline set forth in the Schedule of 
Sponsored GC Trade Timeframes for (i) 
full settlement of the Start Leg of 
Sponsored GC Trades, (ii) substitutions 
of Purchased GC Repo Securities, and 
(iii) satisfaction of GC Collateral Return 
Obligations and cash payment 
obligations associated with GC 
Collateral Return Entitlements by GC 
Funds Lenders and GC Funds 
Borrowers. The current deadline for 
these actions is 5:30 p.m. and the 
proposal would move this deadline to 
7:00 p.m. (New York City times), which 
would align with the close of the 
Fedwire Funds Service at the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York. Currently, 
Sponsored GC Trades for which funds 
are delivered between 5:30 p.m. and 
7:00 p.m. do not settle until the next 
Business Day. FICC states that aligning 
these two deadlines would facilitate 
additional settlement of Sponsored GC 
Trades.
69
 
II. Discussion and Commission 
Findings 
Section 19(b)(2)(C) of the Exchange 
Act
70
directs the Commission to 
approve a proposed rule change of a 
self-regulatory organization if it finds 
that such proposed rule change is 
consistent with the requirements of the 
Exchange Act and rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to such 
organization. After carefully considering 
the Proposed Rule Change, the 
Commission finds that the Proposed 
Rule Change is consistent with the 
requirements of the Exchange Act
71
and 
the rules and regulations thereunder 
applicable to FICC.
72
In particular, the 
Commission finds that the Proposed 
Rule Change is consistent with Sections 
17A(b)(3)(F)
73
of the Exchange Act and 
Rules 17ad–22(e)(4)(i), (e)(6), (e)(7), 
(e)(18)(iv)(C), (e)(19), and (e)(21) 
thereunder.
74
 
A. Consistency With Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Exchange Act 
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Exchange 
Act
75
requires that the rules of a 
clearing agency, such as FICC, be 
designed to, among other things, (i) 
promote the prompt and accurate 
clearance and settlement of securities 
transactions, (ii) assure the safeguarding 
of securities and funds which are in the 
custody or control of the clearing agency 
or for which it is responsible, and (iii) 
protect investors and the public interest. 
As described above in Section I.B., the 
Proposed Rule Change changes to the 
GSD Rules that are designed to 
encourage and facilitate a greater 
number of market participants to utilize 
GSD’s clearance and settlement systems 
for transactions in U.S. securities, 
including for done-with and done-away 
transactions. As described above in 
Section I.A, and as market participants 
have indicated to the Commission, RICs 
and other cash providers may face 
certain issues when seeking to access 
FICC’s clearance and settlement 
services.
76
As described above in 
Section I.B, by creating the CIL Service, 
FICC generally would eliminate margin 
requirements and Funds Only 
Settlement Payments by taking a 
perfected security interest in the 
Purchased GC Repo Securities. The lien 
would also allow FICC not to require a 
Sponsoring Member to guarantee the 
obligations of a CIL Funds Lender under 
a Sponsored GC CIL Trade. The 
elimination of such guarantee 
requirement would have substantial 
capital savings for the Sponsoring 
Member (and corresponding cost 
savings for the CIL Funds Lender). FICC 
would also accommodate the clearance 
and settlement of Sponsored GC CIL 
Trades entered into through a joint 
trading account even before such 
transactions have been allocated. 
Accordingly, the proposed changes are 
designed to address these issues for 
RICs and other cash providers to access 
FICC’s clearance and settlement 
services, which should increase the

A ‘‘covered clearing agency’’ is, among other

seller to every buyer. 17 CFR 240.17ad–22(a); see 
also 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(23) (defining a clearing agency). FICC is a clearing agency registered with 
the Commission under Section 17A of the Exchange 
Act (15 U.S.C. 78q–1), and it acts as a CCP.

promote the prompt and accurate 
clearance and settlement of securities 
transactions because securities 
transactions that might otherwise be 
conducted outside of central clearing 
would benefit from FICC’s risk 
management and guarantee of 
settlement.
77
 
The Proposed Rule Change would 
encourage and facilitate greater 
participation in central clearing, while 
still providing sound risk management 
which would promote the prompt and 
accurate clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions, and would 
protect investors and the public interest.

adopted amendments to the standards 
applicable to covered clearing agencies, 
such as FICC,
78
requiring each such 
clearing agency for U.S. Treasury 
securities to have written policies and 
procedures reasonably designed to, 
among other things, ensure that it has 
appropriate means to facilitate access to 
clearance and settlement services of all 
eligible secondary market transactions 
in U.S. Treasury securities, including 
those of the clearing agency’s indirect 
participants.
79
As the Commission 
explained when adopting the Treasury 
Clearing Rules, U.S. Treasury securities 
play a critical and unique role in the 
U.S. and global economy, serving as a 
significant investment instrument and 
hedging vehicle for investors, a risk-free 
benchmark for other financial 
instruments, and an important 
mechanism for the Federal Reserve’s 
implementation of monetary policy.
80
 
Consequently, confidence in the U.S. 
Treasury market, and in its ability to 
function efficiently is critical to the 
stability of the global financial system. 
In central clearing, through novating 
transactions (i.e., becoming the counterparty to both sides of a 
transaction), a CCP addresses concerns 
about counterparty risk by substituting 
its own creditworthiness and liquidity 
for the creditworthiness and liquidity of 
the counterparties.
81
A CCP thereby 
enables market participants to 
effectively reduce costs, increase 
operational efficiency, and manage 
risks.
82
Moreover, a CCP provides a 
centralized system of default 
management that can mitigate the 
potential for a single market 
participant’s failure to destabilize other 
market participants or the financial 
system more broadly.
83
The 
Commission adopted the Treasury 
Clearing Rules, in part, to help reduce 
contagion risk to the CCP and bring the 
benefits of central clearing to more 
transactions involving U.S. Treasury 
securities, thereby lowering overall 
systemic risk in the market.
84
 
Furthermore, CCP rules that are clear 
and comprehensible, increase 
operational efficiency, and more 
effectively manage risks, like the 
Proposed Rule Change, should 
encourage a broader scope of market 
participants to utilize the CCP’s 
services, thereby promoting the prompt 
and accurate clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions, and protecting 
investors and the public interest, 
consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of 
the Exchange Act. The Proposed Rule 
Change is consistent with those 
objectives because it encourages and 
supports greater participation in GSD’s 
central clearing services for RICs and 
other cash lenders and for done-away 
transactions. Accordingly, the Proposed 
Rule Change would promote the prompt 
and accurate clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions, and protect 
investors and the public interest, 
because by encouraging greater 
participation in central clearing, the 
proposals would extend the benefits of 
operational efficiency and risk 
management to a greater segment of the 
U.S. Treasury securities market. 
In addition, although the proposed 
amendments would not provide FICC 
with custody of any additional 
securities, as described above in Section 
I.B.1, the proposed CIL Custodial 
Agreement Supplement would provide 
FICC with ‘‘control’’ of Purchased GC 
Repo Securities subject to a Sponsored 
GC CIL Trade.
85
FICC’s lien and control 
are specifically designed so that FICC 
can complete settlement of Sponsored 
GC CIL Trades even in a default of the 
CIL Funds Lender or Sponsoring 
Member. Furthermore, the CIL Custodial 
Agreement Supplement would prohibit 
any withdrawals of the Purchased GC 
Repo Securities by the CIL Funds 
Lender other than to allow for ordinary 
course settlement, in a Corporation 
Default, or in respect of securities that 
FICC does not intend to use to complete 
settlement with the GC Funds Borrower 
on the Sponsored GC CIL Trade. 
Accordingly, the proposed changes 
should ensure that the Purchased GC 
Repo Securities subject to FICC’s control 
remain safeguarded in the Buyer’s GC 
CIL Trade Account at the Sponsored GC 
Clearing Agent Bank until such time as 
they are needed for settlement or the 
Sponsored GC CIL Trade is terminated. 
More broadly, the proposed changes 
are designed to ensure that FICC 
calculates and has sufficient resources 
to cover potential losses from a default 
on a done-away Sponsored GC Trade or 
on a Sponsored GC CIL Trade.
86
In the 
case of Sponsored GC CIL Trades, 
FICC’s perfected security interest in the 
Purchased GC Repo Securities subject to 
the Sponsored GC CIL Trades, as 
supplemented by the Clearing Fund 
posted by the Sponsoring Member for its 
Sponsored GC CIL Omnibus Account, 
the mandatory CIL Required Haircut, 
and any Sponsored GC CIL Omnibus 
Account Required Fund Deposit, is 
designed to ensure that FICC has 
sufficient resources to address a default 
of a CIL Funds Lender or its Sponsoring 
Member. As noted above, the perfected 
security interest as well as FICC’s right 
to instruct the Sponsored GC Clearing 
Agent Bank in relation to such securities 
would ensure that FICC can settle with 
the GC Funds Borrower in a CIL Funds 
Lender default or the default of its

Sponsoring Member, provided that the 
Sponsoring Member or its Indirect 
Participant is not the GC Funds 
Borrower. If the Sponsoring Member or 
its Indirect Participant is the GC Funds 
Borrower, FICC may need to terminate 
the Sponsored GC Trade in whole or in 
part and rely upon the Sponsoring 
Member’s Clearing Fund, the CIL 
Required Haircut, or the Sponsored GC 
CIL Omnibus Account Required Fund 
Deposit to cover any losses resulting 
from the liquidation. Such amounts, 
however, would never be less than the 
Clearing Fund FICC would have 
available for a Sponsored GC Trade. 
Therefore, the proposed changes would 
enhance FICC’s ability to safeguard 
funds and securities which are in the 
custody or control of FICC or for which 
it is responsible. 
For the foregoing reasons, the 
Commission finds that the Proposed 
Rule Change is designed to promote the 
prompt and accurate clearance and 
settlement of securities transactions, 
safeguard securities and funds that are 
in the custody or control of FICC, and 
protect investors and the public interest, 
consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of 
the Exchange Act.
87
 
B. Consistency With Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(4)(i) 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(4)(i) under the Act 
requires that FICC establish, implement, 
maintain, and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to 
effectively identify, measure, monitor, 
and manage its credit exposures to 
participants and those arising from its 
payment, clearing, and settlement 
processes by maintaining sufficient 
financial resources to cover its credit 
exposure to each participant fully with 
a high degree of confidence.
88
 
First, as described above in Section 
I.B.1, the proposed changes relating to 
the risk and default management 
mechanism for the CIL Service, i.e., 
FICC’s perfected security interest in the 
Purchased GC Repo Securities subject to 
the Sponsored GC CIL Trades, 
supplemented by the Clearing Fund for 
the Sponsoring Member’s Sponsoring 
Member Omnibus Account, the 
mandatory CIL Required Haircut, and 
the Sponsored GC CIL Omnibus 
Account Required Fund Deposit 
requirement, should ensure that the 
resources available to FICC to manage 
the default on a Sponsored GC CIL 
Trade would accurately reflect FICC’s 
credit exposures to participants in the 
CIL Service, and that FICC would be 
able to use such resources to cover its 
credit exposure in the event of a default 
by the CIL Funds Lender or its 
Sponsoring Member. 
Second, as described in Section I.B.2, 
the done-away Sponsored GC Trades 
(other than Sponsored GC CIL Trades), 
which present the same credit and 
market risk profile as done-with 
Sponsored GC Trades, would be 
margined in the same manner as done- 
with Sponsored GC Trades using 
methodologies that have been approved 
by the Commission.
89
 
Therefore, collectively, these changes 
should enhance the ability of FICC to 
cover its credit exposure to its 
participants with a high degree of 
confidence. Accordingly, the Proposed 
Rule Change is consistent with Rule 
17ad–22(e)(4)(i) under the Act. 
C. Consistency With Rule 17ad–22(e)(6) 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(6) under the Act 
requires, in part, that FICC establish, 
implement, maintain and enforce 
written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to cover its credit 
exposures to its participants by 
establishing a risk-based margin 
system.
90
As described in Section I.B.1, 
the Proposed Rule Change is designed to 
ensure that FICC has sufficient 
resources to perform to non-defaulting 
participants in a participant default. In 
particular, the proposed changes would 
provide FICC, in the form of its lien on 
Purchased GC Repo Securities and the 
potential to require Clearing Fund 
deposits as needed in circumstances 
described above, with resources to 
address a CIL Funds Lender default that 
are equal to, or in excess of, the 
resources FICC calculates using its 
established and approved risk-based 
models as necessary to address the 
default of a Sponsored Member under a 
Sponsored GC Trade. Additionally, as 
described above in Section I.B.2, the 
done-away Sponsored GC Trades (other 
than Sponsored GC CIL Trades), which 
present the same credit and market risk 
profile as done-with Sponsored GC 
Trades, would be margined in the same 
manner as done-with Sponsored GC 
Trades using methodologies that have 
been approved by the Commission.
91
 
Accordingly, the Proposed Rule 
Change would ensure FICC covers its 
credit exposures to its participants 
consistent with Rule 17ad–22(e)(6) 
under the Act. 
D. Consistency With Rule 17ad–22(e)(7) 
Rule 17Ad–22(e)(7) under the Act 
requires a covered clearing agency, such 
as FICC, to establish, implement, 
maintain, and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to 
effectively measure, monitor, and 
manage the liquidity risk that arises in 
or is borne by the covered clearing 
agency.
92
 
As discussed above in Section I.B.1, 
FICC would incorporate Sponsored GC 
CIL Trades into its liquidity risk 
management calculations and into the 
calculation of Sponsoring Members’ 
obligations with respect to CCLF, using 
the same methodology, logic and 
parameters that FICC uses with respect 
to Sponsored GC Trades.
93
 
Additionally, as discussed above in 
Section I.B.2, done-away Sponsored GC 
Trades, which present the same 
liquidity risks as other done-away 
transactions, would be treated 
identically to such other done-away 
transactions for purposes of calculating 
a Sponsoring Member’s CCLF 
obligations. Therefore, collectively, 
these changes should enhance FICC’s 
ability to manage the liquidity risks 
arising from the Sponsored GC CIL 
Trades it clears and settles. 
Accordingly, the Proposed Rule 
Change is consistent with Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(7) under the Act. 
E. Consistency With Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(18)(iv)(C) 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(18)(iv)(C) under the 
Exchange Act requires that a covered 
clearing agency, such as FICC, when 
providing CCP services for transactions 
in U.S Treasury securities, establish 
objective, risk-based, and publicly 
disclosed criteria for participation, 
which ensure that it has appropriate 
means to facilitate access to clearance 
and settlement services of all eligible 
secondary market transactions in U.S. 
Treasury securities, including those of 
indirect participants.
94
 
As described above in Section I.B.1, 
the Proposed Rule Change is designed to 
facilitate increased access to FICC’s 
clearing and settlement services for 
triparty repo transactions by eliminating 
or ameliorating certain existing 
impediments to access that RICs and 
other cash providers face. 
First, FICC’s security interest in the 
Purchased GC Repo Securities would 
address what market participants have 
referred to as ‘‘double margining’’ that 
increases the costs (and thereby 
decreases the ability of) a Sponsoring

Member to provide clearance and 
settlement services to RICs and other 
cash providers.
95
The lien would also 
eliminate the need for a Sponsoring 
Member to guarantee the obligations of 
a CIL Funds Lender. The elimination of 
the guarantee should reduce the capital 
requirements associated with a 
Sponsoring Member providing access to 
FICC’s clearance and settlement 
systems, and thus the costs of providing 
such access. 
Second, the CIL Service would allow 
a Sponsoring Member to submit to FICC 
for clearance and settlement 
transactions that have been entered into 
by multiple RICs or other CIL Funds 
Lenders using a joint trading account. 
Such transactions may be ineligible for 
submission to FICC today because 
investment advisers are unable to 
complete final allocations to individual 
cash providers by the FICC submission 
deadline. As a result, the proposed 
changes should facilitate the ability of 
RICs and other cash providers to access 
FICC’s clearance and settlement services 
in relation to transactions that they are 
currently only able to clear bilaterally. 
Third, the CIL Service would not 
include the exchange of Funds-Only 
Settlement Amounts between FICC and 
a CIL Funds Lender (or its Sponsoring 
Member). This proposed change should 
facilitate access to central clearing by 
eliminating the possibility of such 
Funds-Only Settlement Amount 
obligations and entitlements giving rise 
to operational or regulatory 
impediments for RICs, other cash 
providers, and their Sponsoring 
Members. As such, the CIL Service 
would facilitate access to clearance and 
settlement services of all eligible 
secondary market transactions in U.S. 
Treasury securities, including those of 
indirect participants.
96
 
Moreover, as described in Section 
1.B.2, the proposed changes to provide 
for clearing of done-away Sponsored GC 
Trades and to extend its settlement 
deadline for Sponsored GC Trades 
would promote access to FICC’s 
clearance and settlement systems in 
respect of eligible secondary market 
transactions in U.S. Treasury securities. 
Currently, a Sponsoring Member may 
submit only done-with transactions to 
FICC under the Sponsored GC Service. 
Allowing for the submission of done- 
away transactions should facilitate 
greater access by allowing a Sponsored 
Member to submit more of their eligible 
secondary market transactions and to do 
so without entering into clearing 
agreements with each of their execution 
counterparties. The proposed change to 
align FICC’s settlement and substitution 
deadlines for Sponsored GC Trades with 
the close of the Fedwire Funds Service 
at 7:00 p.m. (New York City time) would 
support the settlement of additional tri- 
party activity and, therefore, also 
promote access to FICC’s clearance and 
settlement systems in respect of eligible 
secondary market transactions. As such, 
these proposed changes should facilitate 
access to clearance and settlement 
services of all eligible secondary market 
transactions in U.S. Treasury 
securities.
97
 
Accordingly, for the reasons above, 
the Proposed Rule Change is consistent 
with Rule 17ad–22(e)(18)(iv)(C).
98
 
F. Consistency With Rule 17ad–22(e)(19) 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(19) under the Act 
requires that FICC establish, implement, 
maintain and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to 
identify, monitor, and manage the 
material risks to the covered clearing 
agency arising from arrangements in 
which firms that are indirect 
participants in the covered clearing 
agency rely on the services provided by 
direct participants to access the covered 
clearing agency’s payment, clearing, or 
settlement facilities.
99
The proposed 
changes relating to the CIL Service 
contain specific risk management 
features to address FICC’s exposure to 
CIL Funds Lenders, including (i) a lien 
on the Purchased GC Repo Securities 
subject to the Sponsored GC CIL Trades, 
(ii) provisions describing how FICC 
would enforce remedies and otherwise 
address such a default, and (iii) the 
Clearing Fund, mandatory CIL Required 
Haircut, and Sponsored GC CIL 
Omnibus Account Required Fund 
Deposit that FICC would require. These 
risk management features should ensure 
that FICC has sufficient resources to 
cover simultaneous default of both a CIL 
Funds Lender and its Sponsoring 
Member and would allow FICC to settle 
with the GC Funds Borrower even in a 
CIL Funds Lender default. 
Because of these features, the 
proposed changes would promote 
FICC’s ability to identify, monitor, and 
manage the material risks arising from 
indirect participants’ (i.e., the CIL Funds Lenders) access to its payment, 
clearing, or settlement facilities and is 
therefore consistent with Rule 17ad- 
22(e)(19). 
G. Consistency With Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(21) 
Rule 17Ad–22(e)(21) under the Act 
requires a covered clearing agency to 
establish, implement, maintain, and 
enforce written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to be efficient and 
effective in meeting the requirements of 
its participants and the markets it 
serves, including the clearing agency’s 
clearing and settlement arrangements 
and the scope of products cleared or 
settled.
100
 
As described above in Sections I.A. 
and I.B.1, market participants have 
stated that FICC’s current Sponsored GC 
Service does not accommodate certain 
aspects of how RICs and other cash 
providers currently conduct repo 
transactions in U.S. Treasury securities, 
including current industry practices in 
which RICs and other cash providers 
collect a haircut from cash borrowers. 
The proposed changes relating to the 
CIL Service contain features to address 
these issues, including a lien on the 
Purchased GC Repo Securities subject to 
the Sponsored GC CIL Trades that 
generally would obviate FICC’s need to 
collect margin or Fund-Only Settlement 
Amounts from CIL Funds Lenders or 
their Sponsors as well as the need to 
obtain a Sponsoring Member Guaranty 
on Sponsored GC CIL Trades. Moreover, 
by providing FICC a lien on the 
Purchased GC Repo Securities in lieu of 
FICC margin charges generally, the 
proposed changes would accommodate 
current industry practices in which RICs 
and other cash providers collect a 
haircut from cash borrowers. 
Additionally, as described above in 
Section I.B.2, FICC’s proposed CIL 
Service would accommodate both done- 
with and done-away Sponsored GC CIL 
Trades. 
By expanding the Sponsored GC 
Service in these ways, the Proposed 
Rule Change is designed to address the 
feedback FICC has received from market 
participants regarding their needs to 
facilitate access to FICC’s clearance and 
settlement services through a 
Sponsoring Member. For these reasons, 
the Proposed Rule Change is consistent 
with Rule 17Ad–22(e)(21)
101
because it 
is responsive to the requests from FICC’s 
members for the ability to trade 
centrally cleared tri-party repos in a 
manner that is efficient and effective in 
meeting the operational requirements of 
FICC’s members. 
III. Conclusion 
On the basis of the foregoing, the 
Commission finds that the Proposed

Rule 4.13, Interpretation and Policy .04 defines 
‘‘reasonably related to the current index value of the 
underlying index’’ as the exercise price (i.e., strike price) being within 30% of the current index value. 
That provision also provides that the Exchange may 
also open for trading additional series of index 
options that are more than 30% away from the 
current index value, provided that demonstrated 
customer interest exists for such series, as 
expressed by institutional, corporate, or individual 
customers or their brokers.

MGTN options are currently not eligible for the 
Nonstandard Expirations Program or QIXs. 
However, the Exchange has a separate proposal 
pending that would permit the Exchange to list 
MGTN options with those expirations. See 
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 104019 
(September 23, 2025), 90 FR 46424 (September 26, 
2025) (SR–CBOE–2025–068). Therefore, this 
proposed provision that would permit $0.50 strikes 
for MGTN series listed with those expirations 
would apply only if the Commission approves that 
filing. If that filing is not approved, then MGTN 
options with all expirations would be eligible for 
$1 strikes only pursuant to this proposed rule 
change. 
7
Current Rule 4.13, Interpretation and Policy 
.01(i) relates to permissible strike prices for options 
on the Mini-Russell 2000 Index (‘‘MRUT options’’ 
or ‘‘Mini-RUT options’’). The proposed rule change 
makes nonsubstantive changes to paragraph (i) so 
that it applies to MRUT options, as well as MBTX 
and MGTN options (but has no impact on 
permissible strike prices for MRUT options). 
Rule Change is consistent with the 
requirements of the Exchange Act and 
in particular with the requirements of 
Section 17A of the Exchange Act
102
and 
the rules and regulations promulgated 
thereunder. 
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act

that proposed rule change SR–FICC–

I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
Cboe Exchange, Inc. (the ‘‘Exchange’’ 
or ‘‘Cboe Options’’) proposes to permit 
strike price intervals for options on the 
Cboe Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index 
(‘‘MBTX options’’) and the Cboe 
Magnificent 10 Index (‘‘MGTN options’’) 
to be no less than $1. The text of the 
proposed rule change is provided in 
Exhibit 5. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is also available on the Commission’s 
website (https://www.sec.gov/rules/

II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
Rules to modify the permissible strike 
price intervals for options on the Cboe 
Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index (‘‘MBTX 
options’’) and the Cboe Magnificent 10 
Index (‘‘MGTN options’’). Pursuant to 
Rule 4.13, Interpretation and Policy 
.01(a), the interval between strike prices 
for index options can be no less than 
$5.00 (with certain specified 
exceptions). Additionally, Rule 4.13, 
Interpretation .01(d) provides that when 
new series of index options with a new 
expiration date are opened for trading, 
or when additional series of index 
options in an existing expiration date 
are opened for trading as the current 
value of the underlying index to which 
such series relate moves substantially 
from the strike prices of series already 
opened, the strike prices of such new or 
additional series shall be reasonably 
related to the current value of the 
underlying index at the time such series 
are first opened for trading. In the case 
of all classes of index options, the term 
‘‘reasonably related to the current value 
of the underlying index’’ shall have the 
meaning set forth in Interpretation and 
Policy .04 under Rule 4.13.
5
These 
provisions currently apply to MBTX 
options and would apply to MGTN 
options (which the Exchange plans to 
begin listing in the fourth quarter of 
2025). 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Rule 4.13, Interpretation and Policy 
.01(i) to provide that notwithstanding 
Interpretation and Policies .01(a), .01(d), 
and .04, the strike price intervals for 
new and additional series of each of 
MBTX options and MGTN options shall 
be listed subject to the following: 
(1) if the current value of the index is 
less than or equal to 20, the Exchange 
shall not list series with an exercise 
price (i.e., strike price) of more than 100% above or below the current value 
of the index; 
(2) if the current value of the index is 
greater than 20, the Exchange shall not 
list series with an exercise price (i.e., 
strike price) of more than 50% above or 
below the current value of the index; 
and 
(3) the lowest strike price interval that 
may be listed for standard index 
options, including LEAPS, is $1, and the 
lowest strike price interval that may be 
listed for series of index options listed 
under the Nonstandard Expirations 
Program in Rule 4.13(e) and for QIX 
index options
6
is $0.50.

MGTN options are not currently eligible for 
Nonstandard Expirations, as a rule filing to permit 
such expiration is pending. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 104019 (September 23, 2025), 90 
FR 185 (September 26, 2025) (SR–CBOE–2025–068). 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’) and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
8
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5)
9
requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged 
in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, 
and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
10
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
In particular, the Exchange believes 
the proposed rule change will protect 
investors and the public interest, 
because it will provide investors with 
greater flexibility by allowing them to 
establish positions better tailored to 
meet their investment objectives. The 
Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change will also remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, because it aligns the permissible 
strike intervals for MBTX and MGTN 
options with permissible strike intervals 
of other index options with similar 
index values, such as options on the 
Mini-Russell 200 Index (‘‘MRUT 
options’’) and the Mini S&P 500 Index 
(‘‘XSP options’’). For example, current 
Rule 4.13, Interpretation and Policy 
.01(i) provides that MRUT options
11
 
may have the same strike prices as 
proposed for MBTX
12
and MGTN.
13
 
Similarly, Rule 4.13, Interpretation and 
Policy .10 provides XSP options may 
have the same strikes as proposed for 
MBTX and MGTN options.
14
 
A wider base of MBTX and MGTN 
options will afford market participants 
additional hedging and trading 
opportunities, including the ability to 
roll positions more aligned with 
movements in the value of the 
underlying index, similar to those 
available for other index options that 
overlie indexes with comparable values. 
For example, if the value of the Cboe 
Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index is 270, 
MBTX options are currently permitted 
to be listed with strikes of 275, 280, and 
285, as opposed to 271, 272 and 273, as 
proposed. Therefore, new strikes are 
added in percentage intervals of 
approximately 1.9% and not investment 
strategies more aligned with moves in 
the index value (such as from 270 to 
272, representing a 0.7% change, and 
thus over 1% away from the next 
highest strike). Additionally, the Cboe 
Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index is 1/10th 
the value of the Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF 
Index, options on which (‘‘CBTX 
options’’) may be listed in the same $5 
strike intervals. Given MBTX options 
have 1/10th the value of CBTX options, 
the Exchange believes MBTX options 
should be permitted in smaller strike 
price intervals than CBTX options. 
MBTX options are intended, among 
other things, to allow smaller-scale 
investors to gain broad exposure to the 
Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index market and 
hedge CBTX-related positions with a 
manageably sized contract, and the 
proposed finer strike prices for MBTX 
options will permit strike prices 
accordingly aligned with CBTX options. 
The proposed rule change will allow the 
Exchange to better respond to customer 
demand for additional strike prices for 
MBTX and MGTN options (the 
Exchange expects this demand for 
MGTN options when listing begins), as 
the more granular strike prices allowed 
by the proposed rule change will permit 
investors to use these options in a 
manner more closely tailored to their 
investment needs, as they are currently 
able to do with other index options. For 
example, if the Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF 
Index value is 2700, the Cboe Mini 
Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index value is 270. 
CBTX options would be permitted to be 
listed with strikes of 2710, 2720, and 
2730. Corresponding MBTX options 
strikes, as proposed, would be 271, 272, 
and 273, as opposed to strikes of only 
270 and 275, as permitted under the 
current rule. The proposed $1 strike 
price intervals for MBTX options will 
permit the listing of series with strikes 
that correspond more closely to CBTX 
option strikes. 
Similarly, while MGTN options do 
not correspond to larger-sized options, 
the proposed $1 strike price intervals for 
MGTN options will permit investors to 
engage in investment strategies more 
closely aligned with movements in the 
value of the underlying index. For 
example, if the value of the Cboe 
Magnificent 10 Index is 400, MBTX 
options are currently permitted to be 
listed with strikes of 405, 410, and 415, 
as opposed to 401, 402, and 403, as 
proposed. Therefore, new strikes are 
added in percentage intervals of 
approximately 1.25% and not 
investment strategies more aligned with 
moves in the index value (such as from 
400 to 402, representing a 0.5% change, 
and thus nearly 1% away from the next 
highest strike). 
The Exchange recognizes the 
proposed $1 strike price intervals for 
MBTX options and MGTN options alone 
do not achieve full alignment with the 
applicable underlying index (or with 
CBTX options with respect to MBTX 
options). For example, if the value of the 
underlying index was 271.5 (and if there 
was a 2715 strike in CBTX options), the 
$1 strike interval would not permit the 
Exchange to list a corresponding 271.5 
strike in MBTX options. However, the 
Exchange believes $1 strike price 
intervals will increase the alignment in 
a manner to provide investors with 
additional flexibility to tailor their 
investment strategies more closely with 
changes in the underlying index value. 
Therefore, the Exchange also proposes 
$0.50 strike price intervals for MBTX 
and MGTN options with Nonstandard 
Expirations
15
and for QIX MBTX and 
MGTN options. The Exchange believes 
that smaller strike intervals for MBTX 
and MGTN options with Nonstandard 
and QIX expirations (all of which are 
‘‘nonstandard’’ expirations with P.M.- 
settlement, and, at times, have 
expirations that coincide) will provide 
market participants with more efficient 
hedging and trading opportunities. The 
proposed $0.50 strike price intervals 
would permit strikes on a more refined 
scale that, at times, will more closely 
reflect values in the underlying RUT 
[sic] Index and allow market 
participants to roll open positions from 
a lower strike to a higher strike in 
conjunction with the price movement of 
the underlying. 
Additionally, the proposed strike 
price range limitations (100% and 50% 
away from the current index value, 
rather than 30% as used in the 
definition of ‘‘reasonably related’’) are 
closely aligned with the strike price 
range limitations for equity and ETF 
options pursuant to the Rule 4.7(b) and 
the Options Listing Procedure Plan

See Rule 4.7(b) 17
See Rule 4.13, Interpretations and Policies .01(i) and .10. 
18
See Rule 4.13, Interpretation and Policy .04. (‘‘OLPP’’).
16
The OLPP and Rule 4.7(b) 
set forth strike price range limitations 
for equity and ETF options which differ 
from the general exercise price range 
limitations for index options set forth in 
Interpretations and Policies .01(d) and 
.04 to Rule 4.13. The Exchange also 
notes that the exercise price range 
limitations currently in place for Mini- 
SPX options and MRUT options are 
consistent with these OLPP 
limitations.
17
Interpretation and Policy 
.01(d) requires the exercise price of each 
series of index options to be reasonably 
related to the current index value of the 
underlying index to which the series 
relates at time the series is first opened 
for trading on the Exchange. 
‘‘Reasonably related to the current index 
value of the underlying index’’ means 
the exercise price must be within 30% 
of the current index value.
18
Pursuant to 
Interpretation and Policy .04 to Rule 
4.13, the Exchange may also open for 
trading additional series of index 
options that are more than 30% away 
from the current index value, provided 
that demonstrated customer interest 
exists for the series. Therefore, if the 
value of the Cboe Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF 
Index or Cboe Magnificent 10 Index is 
200, under the current Rules providing 
general strike price range limitations for 
index options, the Exchange may only 
list options with the strikes ranging 
from $140 to $260 (i.e., 30% above and below the current value). Pursuant to 
the OLPP and Rule 4.7(b) strike price 
limitations for equity and ETF options, 
however, if the underlying price of an 
equity or ETF option is $200 (including 
equities that comprise the Cboe 
Magnificent 10 Index or ETFs that 
comprise the Cboe Mini Bitcoin U.S. 
ETF Index), the Exchange is permitted 
to list options on those stocks or ETFs 
with strikes ranging from $100 through 
$300 (i.e., 50% above and below the current value). Therefore, by applying 
the OLPP limitations, as proposed, if the 
value of the Cboe Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF 
Index or Cboe Magnificent 10 Index is 
200, the Exchange will be able to list 
strikes ranging 50% above and below 
the current value of the index. The 
Exchange believes the proposed exercise 
price limitations for both MBTX and 
MGTN options will put such options on 
equal standing with equity and ETF 
options (including options on equities 
that comprise the Cboe Magnificent 10 
Index and the ETFs that comprise the 
Cboe Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index), as 
well as Mini-SPX options, in connection 
with exercise price limitations and, as a 
result, will allow the Exchange to list 
strikes that more closely reflect the 
current values in the RUT Index and to 
better respond to customer demand for 
MBTX and MGTN options strike prices 
that better relate to current values of the 
underlying indexes. 
The Exchange acknowledges the 
proposed rule change may augment the 
potential number of options series 
available on the Exchange. However, the 
Exchange believes any such increase 
will be moderate and that the number of 
strikes that may be listed will be 
contained by the percentages proposed, 
specifically that strike prices may not be 
listed more than 100% above or below 
the current index value if less than or 
equal to 20, and not more than 50% 
above or below the current index value 
if greater than 20. Rather, the Exchange 
may determine to list strikes in $1 
intervals or higher based on the level of 
the applicable underlying index and 
customer demand. Also, the Exchange 
believes that there is no reason to have 
a more limited range of strikes for 
MBTX or MGTN options than is 
currently permitted for other index 
options that overlie indexes with 
comparable values. Additionally, the 
Exchange believes it and the Options 
Price Reporting Authority (‘‘OPRA’’) 
have the necessary systems capacity to 
handle any potential additional traffic 
associated with this proposed rule 
change. The Exchange also believes that 
TPHs will not have a capacity issue due 
to the proposed rule change. The 
Exchange does not believe that this 
expansion will cause fragmentation of 
liquidity, but rather, believes that finer 
strike intervals will serve to increase 
liquidity available as well as price 
efficiency by providing more trading 
opportunities for all market 
participants. 
Ultimately, the proposed strike price 
intervals will provide the Exchange 
with flexibility to respond to customer 
demand for MBTX and MGTN option 
strike prices that relate to and more 
closely reflect the current value of the 
applicable underlying index, which will 
allow investors to roll open positions 
from a lower strike to a higher strike in 
conjunction with the price movement of 
the underlying index. The Exchange 
believes the proposed strike price 
intervals will afford investors important 
hedging and trading opportunities by 
allowing investors (particularly retail 
investors) to fine-tune their use of both 
MBTX and MGTN options to gain 
exposure to the applicable index, hedge 
index-related positions, and manage 
their portfolios. The proposed rule 
change will add consistency to the 
options market for these index options 
and the options overlying the equities 
and ETFs that comprise each index. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
Exchange does not believe that the 
proposed rule change will impose any 
burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act, because all 
strikes will be available to all market 
participants. The Exchange does not 
believe that the proposed rule change 
will impose any burden on competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act, 
because the proposed strike regime for 
MBTX and MGTN options is available 
for other index options, as discussed 
above. Additionally, the proposed 
percentage bounds for the strike prices 
of MBTX and MGTN options align with 
that of equity and ETF options, 
including the equities that comprise the 
Cboe Magnificent 10 Index and the ETFs 
that comprise the Cboe Mini Bitcoin 
U.S. ETF Index, as provided in Rule 4.7 
and the OLPP. The Exchange believes 
the proposed rule change may promote 
competition by affording investors for 
these index options additional 
investment opportunities that are 
similarly available for other index 
options, which opportunities may be 
more aligned with their investment 
needs and changes in the underlying 
index values. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received written comments on the 
proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The Exchange has filed the proposed 
rule change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
19
and Rule 
19b–4(f)(6) thereunder.
20
Because the 
proposed rule change does not: (i) 
significantly affect the protection of 
investors or the public interest; (ii) 
impose any significant burden on 
competition; and (iii) become operative 
prior to 30 days from the date on which 
it was filed, or such shorter time as the 
Commission may designate, if 
consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest, the 
proposed rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) 
of the Act
21
and Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii) 
thereunder.
22
 
A proposed rule change filed under 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
23
normally does not 
become operative prior to 30 days after 
the date of the filing. However, pursuant 
to Rule 19b4(f)(6)(iii),
24
the Commission 
may designate a shorter time if such 
action is consistent with the protection 
of investors and the public interest. The 
Exchange has asked the Commission to 
waive the 30-day operative delay so that 
the proposal may become operative 
immediately upon filing. The Exchange 
states that the proposal will benefit 
investors by permitting the Exchange to 
list more granular strikes in both MBTX 
and MGTN options as soon as 
practicable, and the more granular 
strikes would permit investors to use 
these options in a manner more closely 
tailored to their investment needs. For 
these reasons, and because the proposed 
rule change does not raise any new or 
novel regulatory issues, the Commission 
finds that waiving the 30-day operative 
delay is consistent with the protection 
of investors and the public interest. 
Accordingly, the Commission hereby 
waives the 30-day operative delay and 
designates the proposed rule change as 
operative upon filing.
25
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
under Section 19(b)(2)(B)
26
of the Act to 
determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments

arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

‘‘Public Customer that is not a Priority Customer’’ 
in the MIAX Options Fee Schedule is substantively 
similar to the origin type of the order ‘‘Professional’’ 
in the MEMX Options Fee Schedule. The term 
‘‘Public Customer’’ means a person that is not a 
broker or dealer in securities. The term ‘‘Priority 
Customer’’ means a person or entity that (i) is not 
a broker or dealer in securities, and (ii) does not 
place more than 390 orders in listed options per day 
on average during a calendar month for its own 
beneficial account(s). See Exchange Rule 100. The term ‘‘Professional’’ means any person or entity that 
(A) is not a broker or dealer in securities; and (B) 
places more than 390 orders in listed options per 
day on average during a calendar month for its own 
beneficial account(s). See Rules of MEMX, Rule 16.1, available at https://info.memxtrading.com/ wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MEMX-Rulebook-

statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend the 
exchange grouping of options exchanges 
within the routing fee table in Section 
1)c) of the Fee Schedule, Fees for 
Customer Orders Routed to Another 
Options Exchange, to adjust the 
groupings of options exchanges. 
Background 
Currently, the Exchange assesses 
routing fees based upon (i) the origin 
type of the order; (ii) whether or not it 
is an order for standard option classes 
in the Penny Interval Program
3
(‘‘Penny 
classes’’) or an order for standard option 
classes which are not in the Penny 
Interval Program (‘‘Non-Penny classes’’) 
(or other explicitly identified classes); 
and (iii) to which away market it is 
being routed. This assessment practice 
is identical to the routing fees 
assessment practice currently utilized 
by the Exchange’s affiliates, MIAX 
PEARL, LLC (‘‘MIAX Pearl’’), MIAX 
Emerald, LLC (‘‘MIAX Emerald’’), and 
MIAX Sapphire, LLC (‘‘MIAX 
Sapphire’’). This is also similar to the 
methodology utilized by the Cboe BZX 
Exchange, Inc. (‘‘Cboe BZX Options’’), a 
competing options exchange, in 
assessing routing fees. Cboe BZX 
Options has exchange groupings in its 
fee schedule, similar to those of the 
Exchange, whereby several exchanges 
are grouped into the same category 
dependent upon the order’s origin type 
and whether it is a Penny or Non-Penny 
class.
4
 
As a result of conducting a periodic 
review of the current transaction fees 
charged by away markets the Exchange 
has determined to amend the exchange 
groupings of options exchanges within 
the routing fee table to better reflect the 
associated costs and fees of routing 
customer orders to certain away markets 
for execution. 
Proposal 
The Exchange proposes to amend the 
table in Section 1)c) of the Exchange’s 
Fee Schedule, Fees for Customer Orders 
Routed to Another Options Exchange, to 
update the exchange groupings of 
options exchanges within the routing 
fee table. Under this proposed change, 
the Exchange will not amend the fees 
associated with the exchange groupings. 
This proposal merely seeks to amend 
the exchange groupings, which change 
is reflected in the routing fee table 
below and described in detail herein.

Options, MEMX ................................................................................................................................................................................ 1.40 The Exchange proposes to remove 
‘‘MEMX’’ from the ‘‘Routed, Public 
Customer that is not a Priority 
Customer, Non-Penny Program’’ $1.25 
fee tier and amend the ‘‘Routed, Public 
Customer that is not a Priority 
Customer, Non-Penny Program’’ $1.40 
fee tier to add ‘‘MEMX’’. This change is 
being made as MEMX LLC (‘‘MEMX’’) 
recently amended its fee schedule and 
now assesses a transaction fee of $1.21 
per contract for orders in Non-Penny 
classes in Professional capacities which 
remove liquidity from the MEMX 
Options Book.

The purpose of the proposal is to 
adjust the routing fee groups for orders 
routed to other exchanges to better 
reflect the associated costs for that 
routed execution in Penny and Non- 
Penny classes as determined by the fees 
and rebates at the executing exchange. 
In determining to amend its groupings, 
the Exchange took into account 
transaction fees assessed by the away 
market to which the Exchange routes 
orders, as well as the Exchange’s 
clearing costs, administrative, 
regulatory, and technical costs 
associated with routing orders to an 
away market. The Exchange uses 
unaffiliated routing brokers to route 
orders to the away markets; the costs 
associated with the use of these services 
are included in the routing fees 
specified in the Fee Schedule. This

See supra note 4. The Cboe BZX Options fee 
schedule has exchange groupings, whereby several 
exchanges are grouped into the same category, 
dependent on the order’s origin type and whether 
it is a Penny or Non-Penny class. 
7
This amount is to cover de minimis differences/ 
changes to away market fees (i.e., minor increases or decreases) that would not necessitate a fee filing 
by the Exchange to re-categorize the away exchange 
into a different grouping. Routing fees are not 
intended to be a profit center for the Exchange and 
the Exchange’s goal regarding routing fees and 
expenses is to be as close as possible to net neutral. 
8
The term ‘‘Member’’ means an individual or 
organization approved to exercise the trading rights 
associated with a Trading Permit. Members are 
deemed ‘‘members’’ under the Exchange Act. See 
Exchange Rule 100.

routing fee structure is not only similar 
to the Exchange’s affiliates, MIAX Pearl, 
MIAX Emerald, and MIAX Sapphire, 
but is also comparable to the structure 
in place on at least one other competing 
options exchange, Cboe BZX Options.
6
 
The Exchange’s routing fee structure 
approximates the Exchange’s costs 
associated with routing orders to away 
markets. The per-contract transaction 
fee amount associated with each 
grouping closely approximates the 
Exchange’s all-in cost (plus an 
additional, non-material amount)
7
to 
execute that corresponding contract at 
that corresponding exchange. 
The Exchange notes that in 
determining whether to adjust certain 
groupings of options exchanges in the 
routing fee table, the Exchange 
considered the transaction fees assessed 
by away markets, and determined to 
amend the grouping of exchanges that 
assess transaction fees for routed orders 
within a similar range. This same logic 
and structure apply to all of the 
groupings in the routing fee table. By 
utilizing the same structure that is 
utilized by the Exchange’s affiliates, 
MIAX Pearl, MIAX Emerald, and MIAX 
Sapphire, the Exchange’s Members
8
 
will be assessed routing fees in a similar 
manner. The Exchange notes that its 
affiliates, MIAX Pearl, MIAX Emerald, 
and MIAX Sapphire, will file to make 
the same proposed routing fee changes 
contained herein. 
Implementation 
The proposed rule changes will 
become effective on December 1, 2025. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal to amend its Fee Schedule is 
consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act
9
 
in general, and furthers the objectives of 
Section 6(b)(4) of the Act
10
in 
particular, in that it is an equitable 
allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and 
other charges among its members and 
issuers and other persons using its 
facilities. The Exchange also believes 
the proposal furthers the objectives of 
Section 6(b)(5) of the Act
11
in that it is 
designed to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in 
general to protect investors and the 
public interest and is not designed to 
permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers and dealers. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed changes to the exchange 
groupings of options exchanges within 
the routing fee table furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(4) of the Act 
and is reasonable, equitable and not 
unfairly discriminatory because the 
proposed change will continue to apply 
in the same manner to all Members that 
are subject to routing fees. The 
Exchange believes the proposed changes 
to the routing fee table exchange 
groupings furthers the objectives of 
Section 6(b)(5) of the Act and is 
designed to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade and is not unfairly 
discriminatory because the proposed 
changes seek to recoup costs that are 
incurred by the Exchange when routing 
orders for Public Customers that are not 
Priority Customers to away markets on 
behalf of Members and does so in the 
same manner for all Members that are 
subject to routing fees. The costs to the 
Exchange to route orders to away 
markets for execution primarily 
includes transaction fees assessed by the 
away markets to which the Exchange 
routes orders, in addition to the 
Exchange’s clearing costs, 
administrative, regulatory and technical 
costs. The Exchange believes that the 
proposed re-categorization of certain 
exchange groupings would enable the 
Exchange to better reflect the costs and 
fees associated with routing orders to 
other exchanges for execution. 
The Exchange places away markets in 
the fee tier grouping that best 
approximates the Exchange’s costs and 
fees to route the orders in that segment 
to that away market. The per-contract 
transaction fee amount associated with 
each grouping approximates the 
Exchange’s all-in cost (plus an 
additional, non-material amount)
12
to 
execute the corresponding contract at 
the corresponding exchange. The 
Exchange believes its tier structure 
represents the best approach to reflect 
the costs and fees associated with 
routing and executing orders on other 
exchanges. As noted above, this routing 
fee structure is comparable to the 
structure in place on at least one other 
competing options exchange, Cboe BZX 
Options.
13
 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
Exchange’s proposed re-categorization 
of certain exchange groupings is 
intended to enable the Exchange to 
recover the costs it incurs to route 
orders to away markets. The costs to the 
Exchange to route orders to away 
markets for execution primarily 
includes the transaction fees assessed by 
the away markets to which the 
Exchange routes orders, in addition to 
the Exchange’s clearing costs, 
administrative, regulatory and technical 
costs. The Exchange does not believe 
that this proposal imposes any 
unnecessary burden on competition 
because it seeks to better reflect the 
costs and fees incurred by the Exchange 
when routing orders to away markets on 
behalf of Members and notes that at 
least one other options exchange has a 
similar routing fee structure.

proposed rule change as described in 
Items I, II, and III below, which Items 
have been prepared by the Exchange. 
The Commission is publishing this 
notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change from interested 
persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend the 
fee schedule (the ‘‘Fee Schedule’’) 
applicable to the Exchange’s options 
trading platform MIAX Pearl Options. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/ 
us-options/pearl-options/rule-filings 
and at MIAX Pearl’s principal office. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend the 
exchange grouping of options exchanges 
within the routing fee table in Section 
1)b) of the Fee Schedule, Fees for 
Customer Orders Routed to Another 
Options Exchange, to adjust the 
groupings of options exchanges. 
Background 
Currently, the Exchange assesses 
routing fees based upon (i) the origin 
type of the order; (ii) whether or not it 
is an order for standard option classes 
in the Penny Interval Program
3
(‘‘Penny 
classes’’) or an order for standard option 
classes which are not in the Penny 
Interval Program (‘‘Non-Penny classes’’) 
(or other explicitly identified classes); 
and (iii) to which away market it is 
being routed. This assessment practice 
is identical to the routing fees 
assessment practice currently utilized 
by the Exchange’s affiliates, Miami 
International Securities Exchange, LLC 
(‘‘MIAX’’), MIAX Emerald, LLC (‘‘MIAX 
Emerald’’), and MIAX Sapphire, LLC 
(‘‘MIAX Sapphire’’). This is also similar 
to the methodology utilized by the Cboe 
BZX Exchange, Inc. (‘‘Cboe BZX 
Options’’), a competing options 
exchange, in assessing routing fees. 
Cboe BZX Options has exchange 
groupings in its fee schedule, similar to 
those of the Exchange, whereby several 
exchanges are grouped into the same 
category dependent upon the order’s 
origin type and whether it is a Penny or 
Non-Penny class.

Exchange notes that the origin type of the order 
‘‘Public Customer that is not a Priority Customer’’ 
in the MIAX Options Fee Schedule is substantively 
similar to the origin type of the order ‘‘Professional’’ 
in the MEMX Options Fee Schedule. The term 
‘‘Public Customer’’ means a person that is not a 
broker or dealer in securities. The term ‘‘Priority 
Customer’’ means a person or entity that (i) is not 
a broker or dealer in securities, and (ii) does not 
place more than 390 orders in listed options per day 
on average during a calendar month for its own 
beneficial account(s). See Exchange Rule 100. The term ‘‘Professional’’ means any person or entity that 
(A) is not a broker or dealer in securities; and (B) 
places more than 390 orders in listed options per 
day on average during a calendar month for its own 
beneficial account(s). See Rules of MEMX, Rule 16.1, available at https://info.memxtrading.com/ wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MEMX-Rulebook-

being made as MEMX LLC (‘‘MEMX’’) 
recently amended its fee schedule and 
now assesses a transaction fee of $1.21

The purpose of the proposal is to 
adjust the routing fee groups for orders 
routed to other exchanges to better 
reflect the associated costs for that 
routed execution in Penny and Non- 
Penny classes as determined by the fees 
and rebates at the executing exchange. 
In determining to amend its groupings, 
the Exchange took into account 
transaction fees assessed by the away 
market to which the Exchange routes

away market. The Exchange uses

are included in the routing fees 
specified in the Fee Schedule. This 
routing fee structure is not only similar 
to the Exchange’s affiliates, MIAX, 
MIAX Emerald, and MIAX Sapphire, 
but is also comparable to the structure 
in place on at least one other competing 
options exchange, Cboe BZX Options.

The Exchange’s routing fee structure 
approximates the Exchange’s costs 
associated with routing orders to away 
markets. The per-contract transaction 
fee amount associated with each 
grouping closely approximates the 
Exchange’s all-in cost (plus an 
additional, non-material amount)
7
to 
execute that corresponding contract at 
that corresponding exchange. 
The Exchange notes that in 
determining whether to adjust certain 
groupings of options exchanges in the 
routing fee table, the Exchange 
considered the transaction fees assessed 
by away markets, and determined to 
amend the grouping of exchanges that 
assess transaction fees for routed orders 
within a similar range. This same logic 
and structure apply to all of the 
groupings in the routing fee table. By 
utilizing the same structure that is 
utilized by the Exchange’s affiliates, 
MIAX, MIAX Emerald, and MIAX 
Sapphire, the Exchange’s Members
8
 
will be assessed routing fees in a similar 
manner. The Exchange notes that its 
affiliates, MIAX, MIAX Emerald, and 
MIAX Sapphire, will file to make the 
same proposed routing fee changes 
contained herein. 
Implementation 
The proposed rule changes will 
become effective on December 1, 2025. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal to amend its Fee Schedule is 
consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act
9
 
in general, and furthers the objectives of 
Section 6(b)(4) of the Act
10
in 
particular, in that it is an equitable 
allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and 
other charges among its members and 
issuers and other persons using its 
facilities. The Exchange also believes 
the proposal furthers the objectives of

in that it is 
designed to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in 
general to protect investors and the 
public interest and is not designed to 
permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers and dealers. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed changes to the exchange 
groupings of options exchanges within 
the routing fee table furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(4) of the Act 
and is reasonable, equitable and not 
unfairly discriminatory because the 
proposed change will continue to apply 
in the same manner to all Members that 
are subject to routing fees. The 
Exchange believes the proposed changes 
to the routing fee table exchange 
groupings furthers the objectives of 
Section 6(b)(5) of the Act and is 
designed to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade and is not unfairly 
discriminatory because the proposed 
changes seek to recoup costs that are 
incurred by the Exchange when routing 
orders for Public Customers that are not 
Priority Customers to away markets on 
behalf of Members and does so in the 
same manner for all Members that are 
subject to routing fees. The costs to the 
Exchange to route orders to away 
markets for execution primarily 
includes transaction fees assessed by the 
away markets to which the Exchange 
routes orders, in addition to the 
Exchange’s clearing costs, 
administrative, regulatory and technical 
costs. The Exchange believes that the 
proposed re-categorization of certain 
exchange groupings would enable the 
Exchange to better reflect the costs and 
fees associated with routing orders to 
other exchanges for execution. 
The Exchange places away markets in 
the fee tier grouping that best 
approximates the Exchange’s costs and 
fees to route the orders in that segment 
to that away market. The per-contract 
transaction fee amount associated with 
each grouping approximates the 
Exchange’s all-in cost (plus an 
additional, non-material amount)
12
to 
execute the corresponding contract at 
the corresponding exchange. The 
Exchange believes its tier structure 
represents the best approach to reflect 
the costs and fees associated with 
routing and executing orders on other 
exchanges. As noted above, this routing 
fee structure is comparable to the 
structure in place on at least one other 
competing options exchange, Cboe BZX 
Options.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
Exchange’s proposed re-categorization 
of certain exchange groupings is 
intended to enable the Exchange to 
recover the costs it incurs to route 
orders to away markets. The costs to the 
Exchange to route orders to away 
markets for execution primarily 
includes the transaction fees assessed by 
the away markets to which the 
Exchange routes orders, in addition to 
the Exchange’s clearing costs, 
administrative, regulatory and technical 
costs. The Exchange does not believe 
that this proposal imposes any 
unnecessary burden on competition 
because it seeks to better reflect the 
costs and fees incurred by the Exchange 
when routing orders to away markets on 
behalf of Members and notes that at 
least one other options exchange has a 
similar routing fee structure.

Currently, the ORF is assessed by C2 Options 
and collected via OCC on executions for the 
account of Public Customers, including 
Professionals, and Broker-Dealers including Foreign 
Broker-Dealers. These market participants clear in 
the ‘‘C’’ range at OCC. ORF will continue to be 
assessed to executions for the account of these 
market participants under the proposed 
methodology. On the Exchange, a ‘‘Public 
Customer’’ means a person that is not a broker or 
dealer in securities and includes Professionals. A 
‘‘Professional’’ is any person or entity that (a) is not 
a broker or dealer in securities, and (b) places more 
than 390 orders in listed options per day on average 
during a calendar month for its own beneficial 
account(s). Executions for the account of an OCC 
clearing member firm proprietary account, joint 
back office account clearing in the Firm range, or 
account of a market maker clearing in the Market 
Maker range are not charged an ORF, nor would 
they be charged an ORF under the current proposal.

The Exchange intends to file an ORF increase to 
$0.0003 per contract effective January 2, 2026. 
5
The Exchange notes that in the case where a 
non-self clearing TPH executes a transaction on the 
Exchange, the TPH’s guaranteeing CTPH is reflected 
as the Executing Clearing Firm in the OCC cleared 
trades file and the ORF is assessed to and collected 
from the Executing Clearing Firm.

The Exchange notes that OCC provides the 
Exchange and other exchanges with information to 
assist in excluding CMTA transfers done to correct 
bona fide errors from the ORF calculation. 
Specifically, if a clearing firm gives up or CMTA 
transfers a position to the wrong clearing firm, the 
firm that caused the error will send an offsetting 
CMTA transfer to that firm and send a new CMTA 
transfer to the correct firm. The offsetting CMTA 
transfer is marked with a CMTA Transfer ORF 
Indicator which results in the original erroneous 
transfer being excluded from the ORF calculation.

notice is hereby given that on December 
2, 2025, Cboe C2 Exchange, Inc. (the 
‘‘Exchange’’ or ‘‘C2’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
Fees Schedule relating to the Options 
Regulatory Fee (‘‘ORF’’) to adopt a new 
methodology for assessment and 
collection of ORF for transactions that 
occur on the Exchange (‘‘On-Exchange 
ORF’’), effective as of July 1, 2026. The 
text of the proposed rule change is 
available on the Commission’s website 
(https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml), the Exchange’s website (https://
www.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/ 
rule_filings/bzx/), and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
current methodology for assessment and 
collection of a regulatory fee to assess 
On-Exchange ORF only for options 
transactions that occur on the Exchange 
that would clear in the customer
3
range 
at The Options Clearing Corporation 
(‘‘OCC’’). The Exchange would no 
longer assess a regulatory fee for options 
transactions that occur on other 
exchanges. This proposal only proposes 
to amend the method of assessment and 
collection of the fee. A future rule filing 
would be filed to set the applicable On- 
Exchange ORF rate. If the On-Exchange 
ORF model were to go into effect today, 
the current ORF rate would increase 
from $0.0002 per contract to an 
estimated On-Exchange ORF rate of 
$0.01521 per contract based on 2026 
estimates of regulatory revenue, 
regulatory costs, and customer volume.
4
 
The following provides more detail 
regarding the proposal. 
Background 
Today, ORF is assessed by C2 Options 
to each Clearing Trading Permit Holder 
(‘‘CTPH’’) for options transactions that 
are cleared by the CTPH at OCC in the 
Customer range, regardless of the 
exchange on which the transaction 
occurs. In other words, the Exchange 
imposes the ORF on all Customer-range 
transactions cleared by a CTPH, even if 
the transactions do not take place on the 
Exchange. The ORF is collected by OCC 
on behalf of the Exchange from the 
CTPH or non-Trading Permit Holder 
(‘‘TPH’’) OCC Clearing Member that 
ultimately clears the transaction as 
further described below. With respect to 
linkage transactions, C2 Options 
reimburses its routing broker providing 
Routing Services pursuant to C2 
Options Rule 5.36 for options regulatory 
fees it incurs in connection with the 
Routing Services it provides. The 
current C2 Options ORF is $0.0002 per 
contract side. 
The following scenarios reflect how 
the ORF is currently assessed and 
collected (these apply regardless of 
whether the transaction is executed on 
the Exchange or on an away exchange): 
1. If a TPH is the executing clearing 
firm on a transaction (‘‘Executing 
Clearing Firm’’), the ORF is assessed to 
and collected from that TPH by OCC on 
behalf of the Exchange. 
2. If a TPH is the Executing Clearing 
Firm and the transaction is ‘‘given up’’ 
to a different TPH that clears the 
transaction (‘‘Clearing Give-Up’’), the 
ORF is assessed to the Executing 
Clearing Firm (the ORF is the obligation 
of the Executing Clearing Firm). The 
ORF is collected from the Clearing Give- 
Up. 
3. If the Executing Clearing Firm is a 
non-TPH and the Clearing Give-up is a 
TPH, the ORF is assessed to and 
collected from the Clearing Give-up. 
4. If a TPH is the Executing Clearing 
Firm and a non-TPH is the Clearing 
Give-up, the ORF is assessed to the 
Executing Clearing Firm. The ORF is the 
obligation of the Executing Clearing 
Firm but is collected from the non-TPH 
Clearing Give-up (for the reasons 
described below). 
5. No ORF is assessed if a TPH is 
neither the Executing Clearing Firm nor 
the Clearing Give-up. 
The Exchange uses an OCC cleared 
trades file to determine the Executing 
Clearing Firm and the Clearing Give- 
up.
5
 
In each of scenarios 1 through 4 
above, if the transaction is transferred 
pursuant to a Clearing Member Trade 
Assignment (‘‘CMTA’’) agreement to 
another clearing firm who ultimately 
clears the transaction, the ORF is 
collected from the clearing firm that 
ultimately clears the transaction (which 
firm may be a non-TPH) by OCC on 
behalf of the Exchange. Using CMTA 
transfer information provided by the 
OCC, the Exchange subtracts the ORF 
charge from the monthly ORF bill of the 
clearing firm that transfers the position 
and adds the charge to the monthly ORF 
bill of the clearing firm that receives the 
CMTA transfer (i.e., the ultimate clearing firm).
6
This process is 
performed at the end of each month on 
each transfer in the OCC CMTA transfer 
file for that month.
7
 
ORF is collected by OCC on behalf of 
the Exchange from the CTPH or non- 
TPH OCC Clearing Member that 
ultimately clears the transaction. While

9
These expectations are estimated and may be 
subject to change. 
10
See supra note 3. 
11
Under the current methodology for assessing 
ORF, the Exchange on which the transaction 
occurred is irrelevant. 
12
The Exchange originally planned to exclude all 
CMTAs whether reported to the Exchange or 
directly to the OCC. If CMTAs are excluded, the 
Exchange would only collect ORF from its TPHs 
and ORF would no longer be collected from non- 
TPHs. The Exchange continues to believe that a 
new ORF model should be assessed to TPHs only, 
but also understands the desire for a uniform 
approach to the assessment and collection of ORF 
across all options exchanges. As of filing, 6 
exchanges have also filed to assess and collect ORF 
to transactions occurring on their respective 
exchanges (see Securities Exchange Act Releases No. 103103 (May 22, 2025), 90 FR 22797 (May 29, 
2025) (SR–MRX–2025–11) as amended by No. 
103618 (August 1, 2025), 90 FR 37910 (August 6,

No. 103620 (August 1, 2025), 90 FR 37918 (August 
8, 2025) (SR–Phlx–2025–30)). As proposed, these 
filings also will consider CMTAs reported to the 
respective exchange and not CMTAs reported 
directly to OCC. 
13
The Exchange estimates it will take 
approximately three months to implement the 
system changes associated with On-Exchange ORF. 
the ORF is an obligation of the 
Executing Clearing Firm, the ORF is 
collected from the clearing firm that 
ultimately clears the eligible trade, even 
if such firm is not a TPH. The Exchange 
and OCC adopted this collection 
method in response to industry 
feedback that it would allow TPHs and 
non-TPHs to more easily pass-through 
the ORF to their customers. In the 
original ORF filing by Cboe Exchange. 
Inc. (‘‘Cboe Options’’), an affiliate of C2 
Options,
8
Cboe Options stated that it 
expected TPHs to pass-through the ORF 
to their customers in the same manner 
that firms pass-through to their 
customers the fees charged by self- 
regulatory organizations (‘‘SROs’’) to 
help the SROs meet their obligations 
under Section 31 of the Exchange Act 
(and the Exchange understands this to 
be the case currently). Accordingly, in 
scenario 4 above, the ORF is collected 
from the non-TPH OCC Clearing 
Member that clears the transaction in 
order to facilitate the pass-through of 
the ORF to the end-customer. Likewise, 
collection of the ORF from the ultimate 
(CMTA) clearing firm facilitates the 
passing the fee through to the end- 
customer. In those cases where the ORF 
is collected from a non-TPH OCC 
Clearing Member, the Exchange 
(through OCC) collects the ORF as a 
convenience for the CTPH whose 
obligation it is to pay the fee to the 
Exchange. 
ORF Revenue and Monitoring of ORF 
Today, revenue generated from ORF, 
when combined with all of the 
Exchange’s other regulatory fees and 
fines, is designed to recover a material 
portion of the regulatory costs to the 
Exchange of the supervision and 
regulation of TPH customer options 
business including performing routine 
surveillances, investigations, 
examinations, financial monitoring, and 
policy, rulemaking, interpretive, and 
enforcement activities. Regulatory costs 
include direct regulatory expenses and 
certain indirect expenses for work 
allocated in support of the regulatory 
function. The direct expenses include 
in-house and third-party service 
provider costs to support the day-to-day 
regulatory work such as surveillances, 
investigations and examinations. The 
indirect expenses include support to the 
regulatory function from such areas as 
human resources, legal, compliance, 
information technology, facilities and 
accounting. Today, these indirect 
expenses are estimated to be 
approximately 23% of the Exchange’s 
total regulatory costs for 2026. Thus, 
direct expenses are estimated to be 
approximately 77% of total regulatory 
costs for 2026.
9
In addition, based on 
the Exchange’s analysis of its regulatory 
work associated with options regulation, 
and considering other regulatory 
revenue, it is the Exchange’s practice 
that revenue generated from ORF not 
exceed more than 75% of total annual 
regulatory costs. 
Proposal for On-Exchange ORF 
C2 Options appreciates the evolving 
changes in the market and regulatory 
environment and has been evaluating its 
current methodologies and practices for 
the assessment and collection of ORF 
while considering industry and 
Commission feedback. As a result of this 
review, the Exchange is proposing the 
On-Exchange ORF, which assesses a 
regulatory fee to only Exchange 
transactions that would clear in the 
Customer range at OCC (as is the case 
today).
10
The following scenarios reflect 
how the On-Exchange ORF will be 
assessed and collected: 
1. If a TPH is the Executing Clearing 
Firm on a transaction that occurred on 
the Exchange, the fee would be assessed 
to and collected from that CTPH by OCC 
on behalf of the Exchange. 
2. If a TPH is the Executing Clearing 
Firm and the transaction is ‘‘given up’’ 
to a Clearing Give-Up, the On-Exchange 
ORF is assessed to the Executing 
Clearing Firm (the On-Exchange ORF 
remains the obligation of the Executing 
Clearing Firm under the proposal), but 
the On-Exchange ORF will be collected 
from the Clearing Give-Up. 
The Exchange expects to provide 
CTPHs sufficient information in 
connection with their invoice in order 
to reconcile charges associated with 
ORF. In addition, the proposed method 
for collecting On-Exchange ORF will 
only consider CMTAs reported to the 
Exchange and not those reported 
directly to OCC. As described above, 
today’s ORF is the responsibility of the 
Executing Clearing Firm and collected 
from the CMTA (which may be a non- 
TPH) as an administrative convenience. 
The Exchange understands that a CMTA 
may be added at order entry, via post- 
trade edit on the Exchange, or post-trade 
at OCC. CMTA transfers that occur at 
OCC do not necessarily contain reliable 
information regarding the Exchange on 
which the original transaction 
occurred.
11
Without specific 
information as to where the original 
transaction occurred, the Exchange 
would not be able to accurately account 
for CMTA transfers that occur at OCC. 
Therefore, the Exchange will only 
account for CMTAs that occur on the 
Exchange (which may be a non-TPH) 
and exclude CMTAs occurring at 
OCC.
12
 
With this proposal, the Exchange 
intends to collect ORF under its current 
methodology for assessment and 
collection of ORF until at least June 30, 
2026. The Exchange is prepared to 
implement On-Exchange ORF effective 
July 1, 2026 if by April 1, 2026 all U.S. 
options exchanges charging an ORF 
have filed to modify their current 
methodologies of assessment of the fee 
to limit the fee to transactions occurring 
on their respective exchange.
13
 
However, if all other options exchanges 
have not filed to adopt a similar 
methodology by April 1st, the Exchange 
will delay implementation 
commensurate with the additional time 
required for other options exchanges to 
adopt a similar method for collection 
and assessment of ORF. The Exchange 
will at that time file a separate rule 
filing with the amount of the On- 
Exchange ORF in advance of assessing 
and collecting the fee under the 
proposed method. The Exchange will 
provide at least 30 days’ notice of the 
applicable On-Exchange ORF rate. The 
Exchange believes a fee to recover [sic] 
costs for regulatory programs associated 
with TPH customer business is

Depending on the operative date for the filing, 
the Exchange will submit an additional filing to 
specify the ORF rate based on the then-current 
estimates for regulatory revenues, regulatory costs

If the Exchange changes its method of funding 
regulation or if circumstances otherwise change in 
the future, the Exchange may decide to modify On- 
Exchange ORF or assess a separate regulatory fee on 
TPH proprietary transactions if the Exchange deems 
it advisable. 
reasonable; however, the Exchange 
would consider alternative approaches 
for assessment and collection of the fee 
in order to achieve consistency across 
the industry. 
To demonstrate the impact of the 
proposed change, the Exchange 
estimates that, if the On-Exchange ORF 
went into effect today, the current ORF 
of $0.0002 per contract side would 
increase to $0.01521 per contract side 
using 2026 estimates for regulatory 
revenue, regulatory costs and customer 
volume.
14
As is the case today, revenue 
generated from On-Exchange ORF, 
when combined with all of the 
Exchange’s other regulatory fees and 
fines, is designed to recover a material 
portion of the regulatory costs to the 
Exchange of the supervision and 
regulation of TPH customer options 
business, including performing routine 
surveillances, investigations, 
examinations, financial monitoring, and 
policy, rulemaking, interpretive, and 
enforcement activities. As discussed 
above, regulatory costs include direct 
regulatory expenses
15
and certain 
indirect expenses in support of the 
regulatory function.
16
Indirect expenses 
are estimated to be approximately 23% 
of the Exchange’s total regulatory costs 
for 2026. Thus, direct expenses are 
estimated to be approximately 77% of 
total regulatory costs for 2026. 
The Exchange will continue to 
monitor the amount of revenue 
collected from On-Exchange ORF to 
ensure that it, in combination with its 
other regulatory fees and fines, does not 
exceed the Exchange’s total regulatory 
costs. Further, C2 Options expects to 
continue its current practice that 
revenue generated from On-Exchange 
ORF not exceed more than [sic] 75% of 
total annual regulatory costs. And as is 
the Exchange’s practice today, revenue 
generated by On-Exchange ORF will not 
be used for non-regulatory purposes. 
The Exchange will continue to 
monitor its regulatory costs and 
revenues at a minimum on a semi- 
annual basis. If the Exchange 
determines regulatory revenues exceed 
or are insufficient to cover a material 
portion of its regulatory costs in a given 
year, the Exchange will adjust the On- 
Exchange ORF by submitting a fee 
change filing to the Commission. The 
Exchange will notify TPHs of 
adjustments to the On-Exchange ORF 
via an Exchange Notice in advance of 
any change.
17
 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the Act 
and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
18
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) 
of the Act,
19
which provides that 
Exchange rules may provide for the 
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees, and other charges among its TPHs 
and other persons using its facilities. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
20
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
change to assess and collect an On- 
Exchange ORF is reasonable, equitable 
and not unfairly discriminatory for 
various reasons. First, On-Exchange 
ORF is reasonable, equitable and not 
unfairly discriminatory in that it is 
charged to all Exchange transactions 
that clear in the Customer range at the 
OCC. Similar to ORF today, the 
Exchange believes On-Exchange ORF 
ensures fairness by assessing a specific 
fee to those TPHs that require more 
Exchange regulatory services based on 
the amount of customer options 
business they conduct. Over recent 
years, options trading volume has 
increased with a growing percentage of 
the volume applicable to customer 
transactions. Customers trading on the 
Exchange (through a TPH) benefit from 
the protections of a robust regulatory 
program including the maintenance of 
fair and orderly markets and protections 
against fraud and other manipulation. 
The Exchange believes it is equitable 
and not unfairly discriminatory to 
assess a regulatory fee to transactions 
that clear in the Customer range to cover 
regulatory costs, but not to transactions 
clearing in the Firm or Market Maker 
range because CTPHs and Market Maker 
TPHs (who clear in the Firm and Market 
Maker range), as those market 
participants are generally subject to 
other Exchange fees, fines and 
obligations. For example, CTPHs and 
Market Maker TPHs are required to pay 
Exchange application fees, permit fees, 
and connectivity fees, amongst others. 
In addition, all fines issued by the 
Exchange for regulatory infractions are 
assessed only to TPHs and would be 
applied to regulatory revenues. As with 
today’s ORF, the Exchange expects that 
CTPHs from whom On-Exchange ORF is 
collected will pass through the fee to 
their customers (as the Exchange 
understands occurs today). In addition, 
Market Makers in particular are subject 
to various quoting and other obligations 
to ensure that they provide stable and 
liquid markets, which benefit all market 
participants including customers. 
Excluding Market Maker transactions 
from On-Exchange ORF will allow 
Market Makers to better manage their 
costs more effectively thus enabling 
them to better allocate resources toward 
technology, risk management, and 
capacity to ensure continued liquidity 
provision. 
In addition to the overall increase in 
Customer-range volume generally, 
regulating customer trading activity is 
more labor intensive and requires 
greater expenditure of human and 
technical resources than regulating non- 
customer trading activity, which tends 
to be more automated and less labor- 
intensive. For example, there are costs 
associated with main office and branch 
office examinations (e.g., staff and travel expenses), as well as investigations into 
customer complaints and terminations 
of Registered Persons. As a result, the 
costs associated with administering the 
customer component of the Exchange’s 
overall regulatory program are 
materially higher than the costs 
associated with administering the non- 
customer component (e.g., CTPH proprietary transactions) of its 
regulatory program.
21
While the 
Exchange notes that it has broad 
regulatory responsibilities with respect 
to its TPHs’ activities, irrespective of 
where their transactions take place, the 
Exchange believes it is reasonable to 
assess the proposed fee to only those 
transactions occurring on the Exchange. 
The proposed change more narrowly 
tailors the fee to products and 
transactions with a direct connection to 
the Exchange. Today, a customer 
transaction may be assessed an ORF 
from every options exchange totaling as 
much as $0.0187 per transaction per

As of October 1, 2025. 
23
Under the current methodology for assessing 
ORF, the Exchange on which the transaction 
occurred is irrelevant. 
24
Consistent with Rule 2.2 (Regulatory Revenue), 
the Exchange notes that should excess ORF revenue 
be collected prior to any reduction in an ORF rate, 
such excess revenue will not be used for 
nonregulatory purposes. 
25

side.
22
While the Exchange’s proposed 
ORF rate under the proposed model of 
$0.01521 is higher than its current ORF 
rate of $0.0002 under the current model, 
if all exchanges adopted a similar on- 
exchange model, ORF rates may 
decrease for individual transactions 
overall because the proposed On- 
Exchange ORF will avoid overlapping 
ORFs that would otherwise be assessed 
by C2 Options and other options 
exchanges that also assess an ORF. With 
this proposal, transactions that would 
clear in the Customer range occurring 
on other exchanges would no longer be 
subject to an ORF assessed by C2 
Options. 
The Exchange believes it is equitable 
and not unduly discriminatory to 
modify the method of collecting the fee 
such that On-Exchange ORF will not 
consider CMTAs reported directly to 
OCC as is done in today’s method of 
ORF. CMTA transfers are considered 
today under the current collection 
methodology for ORF as a convenience 
to industry members in administering a 
pass through of the fee to their 
customers. Limiting the On-Exchange 
ORF to transactions on the Exchange 
poses a limitation in the use of CMTA 
for this purpose. The Exchange 
understands that a CMTA may be added 
at order entry, via post-trade edit on the 
Exchange, or post-trade at OCC. CMTA 
transfers that occur at OCC do not 
necessarily contain reliable information 
regarding the Exchange on which the 
original transaction occurred.
23
Without 
specific information as to where the 
original transaction occurred, the 
Exchange would not be able to 
accurately account for CMTA transfers 
that occur at OCC. 
The Exchange also believes that the 
fact that a Consolidated Audit Trail 
(‘‘CAT’’) fee is in place should not 
preclude the Exchange from assessing 
On-Exchange ORF. The CAT is a 
repository of order, trade and customer 
information that is used as the basis for 
an audit trail of such activities. Like 
industry members, the exchanges, 
including C2 Options, also pays a CAT 
fee to support the operation and 
maintenance of CAT (in other words, it 
does not support regulatory work 
undertaken by exchanges). C2 Options 
does not include fees it pays for CAT in 
the regulatory expenses it looks to offset 
under ORF. Yes, the Exchange uses CAT 
data as part of its regulatory work, but 
only from an audit trail perspective. On- 
Exchange ORF, on the other hand, 
offsets the regulatory work the Exchange 
performs (using CAT data among other 
sources) such as surveillance, 
investigations, examinations, etc. The 
Exchange believes its fair and 
reasonable to assess an On-Exchange 
ORF in addition to fees associated with 
CAT. 
The Exchange further believes that the 
proposed change to the method for 
assessment and collection of the fee is 
reasonable because it would help ensure 
that revenue collected from the On- 
Exchange ORF, in combination with 
other regulatory fees and fines, would 
help offset, but not exceed, the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. As 
discussed, On-Exchange ORF is 
similarly designed to the current ORF, 
in that revenues generated from the fee 
would be less than or equal to 75% of 
the Exchange’s regulatory costs, which 
is consistent with the practice across the 
options industry today and the view of 
the Commission that regulatory fees be 
used for regulatory purposes and not to 
support the Exchange’s business side. 
As noted above, the Exchange will 
also continue to monitor on at least a 
semi-annual basis the amount of 
revenue collected from the On-Exchange 
ORF, even as amended, to ensure that it, 
in combination with its other regulatory 
fees and fines, does not exceed the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. If the 
Exchange determines regulatory 
revenues would exceed its regulatory 
costs in a given year, the Exchange will 
reduce the On-Exchange ORF by 
submitting a fee change filing to the 
Commission.
24
 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. This 
proposal does not create an unnecessary 
or inappropriate intra-market burden on 
competition because On-Exchange ORF 
applies to all customer activity on the 
Exchange, thereby raising regulatory 
revenue to offset regulatory expenses. It 
also supplements the regulatory revenue 
derived from non-customer activity. The 
Exchange notes, however, the proposed 
change is not designed to address any 
competitive issues. Indeed, this 
proposal does not create an unnecessary 
or inappropriate inter-market burden on 
competition because it is a regulatory 
fee that supports regulation in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
The Exchange is obligated to ensure that 
the amount of regulatory revenue 
collected from the On-Exchange ORF, in 
combination with its other regulatory 
fees and fines, does not exceed 
regulatory costs. In addition, the 
Exchange will not implement the On- 
Exchange ORF until all other options 
exchanges are prepared to adopt a 
similar model to avoid overlapping 
ORFs. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received written comments on the 
proposed rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) 
of the Act
25
and paragraph (f) of Rule 
19b–4
26
thereunder. At any time within 
60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved.

Currently, the ORF is assessed by BZX Options 
and collected via OCC on executions for the 
account of Public Customers, including 
Professionals, and Broker-Dealers including Foreign 
Broker-Dealers. These market participants clear in 
the ‘‘C’’ range at OCC. ORF will continue to be 
assessed to executions for the account of these 
market participants under the proposed 
methodology. On the Exchange, a ‘‘Public 
Customer’’ means a person that is not a broker or 
dealer in securities and includes Professionals. A 
‘‘Professional’’ is any person or entity that (a) is not 
a broker or dealer in securities, and (b) places more 
than 390 orders in listed options per day on average 
during a calendar month for its own beneficial 
account(s). Executions for the account of an OCC 
clearing member firm proprietary account, joint 
back office account clearing in the Firm range, or 
account of a market maker clearing in the Market 
Maker range are not charged an ORF, nor would 
they be charged an ORF under the current proposal.

The Exchange intends to file an ORF increase to 
$0.0002 per contract effective January 1, 2026.

Proposed Rule Change To Adopt a

December 15, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
2, 2025, Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the 
‘‘Exchange’’ or ‘‘BZX’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
Fees Schedule relating to the Options 
Regulatory Fee (‘‘ORF’’) to adopt a new 
methodology for assessment and 
collection of ORF for transactions that 
occur on the Exchange (‘‘On-Exchange 
ORF’’), effective as of July 1, 2026. The 
text of the proposed rule change is 
available on the Commission’s website 
(https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml), the Exchange’s website (https://
www.cboe.com/us/equities/regulation/ 
rule_filings/bzx/), and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
current methodology for assessment and 
collection of a regulatory fee to assess 
On-Exchange ORF only for options 
transactions that occur on the Exchange 
that would clear in the customer
3
range 
at The Options Clearing Corporation 
(‘‘OCC’’). The Exchange would no 
longer assess a regulatory fee for options 
transactions that occur on other 
exchanges. This proposal only proposes 
to amend the method of assessment and 
collection of the fee. A future rule filing 
would be filed to set the applicable On- 
Exchange ORF rate. If the On-Exchange 
ORF model were to go into effect today, 
the current ORF rate would increase 
from $0.0001 per contract to an 
estimated On-Exchange ORF rate of 
$0.00467 per contract based on 2026 
estimates of regulatory revenue, 
regulatory costs, and customer volume.
4
 
The following provides more detail 
regarding the proposal. 
Background 
Today, ORF is assessed by BZX 
Options to each Member for options 
transactions that are cleared by the 
Member (‘‘Clearing Member’’) at OCC in 
the Customer range, regardless of the 
exchange on which the transaction 
occurs. In other words, the Exchange 
imposes the ORF on all Customer-range 
transactions cleared by a Member, even 
if the transactions do not take place on 
the Exchange. The ORF is collected by 
OCC on behalf of the Exchange from the 
Clearing Member or non-Member that 
ultimately clears the transaction as 
further described below. With respect to 
linkage transactions, BZX Options 
reimburses its routing broker providing 
Routing Services pursuant to BZX 
Options Rule 21.9 for options regulatory 
fees it incurs in connection with the 
Routing Services it provides. The 
current BZX Options ORF is $0.0001 per 
contract side. 
The following scenarios reflect how 
the ORF is currently assessed and 
collected (these apply regardless of 
whether the transaction is executed on 
the Exchange or on an away exchange): 
1. If a Member is the executing 
clearing firm on a transaction 
(‘‘Executing Clearing Firm’’), the ORF is 
assessed to and collected from that 
Member by OCC on behalf of the 
Exchange. 
2. If a Member is the Executing 
Clearing Firm and the transaction is 
‘‘given up’’ to a different Member that 
clears the transaction (‘‘Clearing Give- 
Up’’), the ORF is assessed to the 
Executing Clearing Firm (the ORF is the 
obligation of the Executing Clearing 
Firm). The ORF is collected from the 
Clearing Give-Up. 
3. If the Executing Clearing Firm is a 
non-Member and the Clearing Give-up 
is a Member, the ORF is assessed to and 
collected from the Clearing Give-up. 
4. If a Member is the Executing 
Clearing Firm and a non-Member is the 
Clearing Give-up, the ORF is assessed to 
the Executing Clearing Firm. The ORF is 
the obligation of the Executing Clearing 
Firm but is collected from the non- 
Member Clearing Give-up (for the 
reasons described below).

The Exchange notes that in the case where a 
non-self clearing Member executes a transaction on 
the Exchange, the Member’s guaranteeing Clearing 
Member is reflected as the Executing Clearing Firm 
in the OCC cleared trades file and the ORF is 
assessed to and collected from the Executing 
Clearing Firm. 
6
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 83878 (August 17, 2018), 83 FR 42715 (August 23, 2018) 
(SR–CboeBZX–2018–061). 
7
The Exchange notes that OCC provides the 
Exchange and other exchanges with information to 
assist in excluding CMTA transfers done to correct 
bona fide errors from the ORF calculation. 
Specifically, if a clearing firm gives up or CMTA 
transfers a position to the wrong clearing firm, the 
firm that caused the error will send an offsetting 
CMTA transfer to that firm and send a new CMTA 
transfer to the correct firm. The offsetting CMTA 
transfer is marked with a CMTA Transfer ORF 
Indicator which results in the original erroneous 
transfer being excluded from the ORF calculation. 
8
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 58817 (October 20, 2008), 73 FR 63744 (October 27, 2008) 
(SR–CBOE–2008–105). 
9
These expectations are estimated and may be 
subject to change. 
10
See supra note 3. 
11
Under the current methodology for assessing 
ORF, the Exchange on which the transaction 
occurred is irrelevant. 
12
The Exchange originally planned to exclude all 
CMTAs whether reported to the Exchange or 
directly to the OCC. If CMTAs are excluded, the 
Exchange would only collect ORF from its Members 
and ORF would no longer be collected from non- 
Members. The Exchange continues to believe that 
5. No ORF is assessed if neither the 
Executing Clearing Firm nor the 
Clearing Give-up are Members. 
The Exchange uses an OCC cleared 
trades file to determine the Executing 
Clearing Firm and the Clearing Give- 
up.
5
 
In each of scenarios 1 through 4 
above, if the transaction is transferred 
pursuant to a Clearing Member Trade 
Assignment (‘‘CMTA’’) agreement to 
another clearing firm who ultimately 
clears the transaction, the ORF is 
collected from the clearing firm that 
ultimately clears the transaction (which 
firm may be a non-Member) by OCC on 
behalf of the Exchange. Using CMTA 
transfer information provided by the 
OCC, the Exchange subtracts the ORF 
charge from the monthly ORF bill of the 
clearing firm that transfers the position 
and adds the charge to the monthly ORF 
bill of the clearing firm that receives the 
CMTA transfer (i.e., the ultimate clearing firm).
6
This process is 
performed at the end of each month on 
each transfer in the OCC CMTA transfer 
file for that month.
7
 
ORF is collected by OCC on behalf of 
the Exchange from the Member or non- 
Member OCC Clearing Member that 
ultimately clears the transaction. While 
the ORF is an obligation of the 
Executing Clearing Firm, the ORF is 
collected from the clearing firm that 
ultimately clears the eligible trade, even 
if such firm is not a Member. The 
Exchange and OCC adopted this 
collection method in response to 
industry feedback that it would allow 
Members and non-Members to more 
easily pass-through the ORF to their 
customers. In the original ORF filing by 
Cboe Exchange. Inc. (‘‘Cboe Options’’), 
an affiliate of BZX Options,
8
Cboe 
Options stated that it expected its 
members to pass-through the ORF to 
their customers in the same manner that 
firms pass-through to their customers 
the fees charged by self-regulatory 
organizations (‘‘SROs’’) to help the 
SROs meet their obligations under 
Section 31 of the Exchange Act (and the 
Exchange understands this to be the 
case currently). Accordingly, in scenario 
4 above, the ORF is collected from the 
non-Member OCC Clearing Member that 
clears the transaction in order to 
facilitate the pass-through of the ORF to 
the end-customer. Likewise, collection 
of the ORF from the ultimate (CMTA) 
clearing firm facilitates the passing the 
fee through to the end-customer. In 
those cases where the ORF is collected 
from a non-Member, the Exchange 
(through OCC) collects the ORF as a 
convenience for the Member whose 
obligation it is to pay the fee to the 
Exchange. 
ORF Revenue and Monitoring of ORF 
Today, revenue generated from ORF, 
when combined with all of the 
Exchange’s other regulatory fees and 
fines, is designed to recover a material 
portion of the regulatory costs to the 
Exchange of the supervision and 
regulation of Member customer options 
business including performing routine 
surveillances, investigations, 
examinations, financial monitoring, and 
policy, rulemaking, interpretive, and 
enforcement activities. Regulatory costs 
include direct regulatory expenses and 
certain indirect expenses for work 
allocated in support of the regulatory 
function. The direct expenses include 
in-house and third-party service 
provider costs to support the day-to-day 
regulatory work such as surveillances, 
investigations and examinations. The 
indirect expenses include support to the 
regulatory function from such areas as 
human resources, legal, compliance, 
information technology, facilities and 
accounting. Today, these indirect 
expenses are estimated to be 
approximately 28% of the Exchange’s 
total regulatory costs for 2026. Thus, 
direct expenses are estimated to be 
approximately 72% of total regulatory 
costs for 2026.
9
In addition, based on 
the Exchange’s analysis of its regulatory 
work associated with options regulation, 
and considering other regulatory 
revenue, it is the Exchange’s practice 
that revenue generated from ORF not 
exceed more than 75% of total annual 
regulatory costs. 
Proposal for On-Exchange ORF 
BZX Options appreciates the evolving 
changes in the market and regulatory 
environment and has been evaluating its 
current methodologies and practices for 
the assessment and collection of ORF 
while considering industry and 
Commission feedback. As a result of this 
review, the Exchange is proposing the 
On-Exchange ORF, which assesses a 
regulatory fee to only Exchange 
transactions that would clear in the 
Customer range at OCC (as is the case 
today).
10
The following scenarios reflect 
how the On-Exchange ORF will be 
assessed and collected: 
1. If a Member is the Executing 
Clearing Firm on a transaction that 
occurred on the Exchange, the fee 
would be assessed to and collected from 
that Member by OCC on behalf of the 
Exchange. 
2. If a Member is the Executing 
Clearing Firm and the transaction is 
‘‘given up’’ to a Clearing Give-Up, the 
On-Exchange ORF is assessed to the 
Executing Clearing Firm (the On- 
Exchange ORF remains the obligation of 
the Executing Clearing Firm under the 
proposal), but the On-Exchange ORF 
will be collected from the Clearing Give- 
Up. 
The Exchange expects to provide 
Members sufficient information in 
connection with their invoice in order 
to reconcile charges associated with 
ORF. In addition, the proposed method 
for collecting On-Exchange ORF will 
only consider CMTAs reported to the 
Exchange and not those reported 
directly to OCC. As described above, 
today’s ORF is the responsibility of the 
Executing Clearing Firm and collected 
from the CMTA (which may be a non- 
Member) as an administrative 
convenience. The Exchange 
understands that a CMTA may be added 
at order entry, via post-trade edit on the 
Exchange, or post-trade at OCC. CMTA 
transfers that occur at OCC do not 
necessarily contain reliable information 
regarding the Exchange on which the 
original transaction occurred.
11
Without 
specific information as to where the 
original transaction occurred, the 
Exchange would not be able to 
accurately account for CMTA transfers 
that occur at OCC. Therefore, the 
Exchange will only account for CMTAs 
that occur on the Exchange (which may 
be a non-Member) and exclude CMTAs 
occurring at OCC.

only, but also understands the desire for a uniform 
approach to the assessment and collection of ORF 
across all options exchanges. As of filing, 6 
exchanges have also filed to assess and collect ORF 
to transactions occurring on their respective 
exchanges (see Securities Exchange Act Releases No. 103103 (May 22, 2025), 90 FR 22797 (May 29, 
2025) (SR–MRX–2025–11) as amended by No.

8, 2025) (SR–Phlx–2025–30)). As proposed, these 
filings also will consider CMTAs reported to the 
respective exchange and not CMTAs reported 
directly to OCC. 
13
The Exchange estimates it will take 
approximately three months to implement the 
system changes associated with On-Exchange ORF. 
14
Depending on the operative date for the filing, 
the Exchange will submit an additional filing to 
specify the ORF rate based on the then-current 
estimates for regulatory revenues, regulatory costs 
and Customer volume. 
15
Direct expenses include in-house and third- 
party service provider costs to support the day-to- 
day regulatory work such as surveillances, 
investigations, and examinations. 
16
Indirect expenses include support from areas 
such as human resources, legal, compliance, 
information technology, facilities and accounting.

With this proposal, the Exchange 
intends to collect ORF under its current 
methodology for assessment and 
collection of ORF until at least June 30, 
2026. The Exchange is prepared to 
implement On-Exchange ORF effective 
July 1, 2026 if by April 1, 2026 all U.S. 
options exchanges charging an ORF 
have filed to modify their current 
methodologies of assessment of the fee 
to limit the fee to transactions occurring 
on their respective exchange.
13
 
However, if all other options exchanges 
have not filed to adopt a similar 
methodology by April 1st, the Exchange 
will delay implementation 
commensurate with the additional time 
required for other options exchanges to 
adopt a similar method for collection 
and assessment of ORF. The Exchange 
will at that time file a separate rule 
filing with the amount of the On- 
Exchange ORF in advance of assessing 
and collecting the fee under the 
proposed method. The Exchange will 
provide at least 30 days’ notice of the 
applicable On-Exchange ORF rate. The 
Exchange believes a fee to recover [sic] 
costs for regulatory programs associated 
with Member customer business is 
reasonable; however, the Exchange 
would consider alternative approaches 
for assessment and collection of the fee 
in order to achieve consistency across 
the industry. 
To demonstrate the impact of the 
proposed change, the Exchange 
estimates that, if the On-Exchange ORF 
went into effect today, the current ORF 
of $0.0001 per contract side would 
increase to $0.00467 per contract side 
using 2026 estimates for regulatory 
revenue, regulatory costs and customer 
volume.
14
As is the case today, revenue 
generated from On-Exchange ORF, 
when combined with all of the 
Exchange’s other regulatory fees and 
fines, is designed to recover a material 
portion of the regulatory costs to the 
Exchange of the supervision and 
regulation of Member customer options 
business, including performing routine 
surveillances, investigations, 
examinations, financial monitoring, and 
policy, rulemaking, interpretive, and 
enforcement activities. As discussed 
above, regulatory costs include direct 
regulatory expenses
15
and certain 
indirect expenses in support of the 
regulatory function.
16
Indirect expenses 
are estimated to be approximately 28% 
of the Exchange’s total regulatory costs 
for 2026. Thus, direct expenses are 
estimated to be approximately 72% of 
total regulatory costs for 2026. 
The Exchange will continue to 
monitor the amount of revenue 
collected from On-Exchange ORF to 
ensure that it, in combination with its 
other regulatory fees and fines, does not 
exceed the Exchange’s total regulatory 
costs. Further, BZX Options expects to 
continue its current practice that 
revenue generated from On-Exchange 
ORF not exceed more than [sic] 75% of 
total annual regulatory costs. And as is 
the Exchange’s practice today, revenue 
generated by On-Exchange ORF will not 
be used for non-regulatory purposes. 
The Exchange will continue to 
monitor its regulatory costs and 
revenues at a minimum on a semi- 
annual basis. If the Exchange 
determines regulatory revenues exceed 
or are insufficient to cover a material 
portion of its regulatory costs in a given 
year, the Exchange will adjust the On- 
Exchange ORF by submitting a fee 
change filing to the Commission. The 
Exchange will notify Members of 
adjustments to the On-Exchange ORF 
via an Exchange Notice in advance of 
any change.
17
 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the Act 
and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
18
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) 
of the Act,
19
which provides that 
Exchange rules may provide for the 
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees, and other charges among its 
Members and other persons using its 
facilities. Additionally, the Exchange 
believes the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the Section 6(b)(5)
20
 
requirement that the rules of an 
exchange not be designed to permit 
unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
change to assess and collect an On- 
Exchange ORF is reasonable, equitable 
and not unfairly discriminatory for 
various reasons. First, On-Exchange 
ORF is reasonable, equitable and not 
unfairly discriminatory in that it is 
charged to all Exchange transactions 
that clear in the Customer range at the 
OCC. Similar to ORF today, the 
Exchange believes On-Exchange ORF 
ensures fairness by assessing a specific 
fee to those Members that require more 
Exchange regulatory services based on 
the amount of customer options 
business they conduct. Over recent 
years, options trading volume has 
increased with a growing percentage of 
the volume applicable to customer 
transactions. Customers trading on the 
Exchange (through a Member) benefit 
from the protections of a robust 
regulatory program including the 
maintenance of fair and orderly markets 
and protections against fraud and other 
manipulation. The Exchange believes it 
is equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory to assess a regulatory fee 
to transactions that clear in the 
Customer range to cover regulatory 
costs, but not to transactions clearing in 
the Firm or Market Maker range because 
Clearing Members and Market Makers 
(who clear in the Firm and Market 
Maker range), as those market 
participants are generally subject to 
other Exchange fees, fines and 
obligations. For example, Clearing 
Members and Market Makers are 
required to pay Exchange application 
fees, permit fees, and connectivity fees, 
amongst others. In addition, all fines 
issued by the Exchange for regulatory 
infractions are assessed only to 
Members and would be applied to 
regulatory revenues. As with today’s 
ORF, the Exchange expects that 
Members from whom On-Exchange ORF 
is collected will pass through the fee to 
their customers (as the Exchange 
understands occurs today). In addition, 
Market Makers in particular are subject 
to various quoting and other obligations 
to ensure that they provide stable and

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159250 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices 21
If the Exchange changes its method of funding 
regulation or if circumstances otherwise change in 
the future, the Exchange may decide to modify On- 
Exchange ORF or assess a separate regulatory fee on 
Member proprietary transactions if the Exchange 
deems it advisable. 
22
As of October 1, 2025. 
23
Under the current methodology for assessing 
ORF, the Exchange on which the transaction 
occurred is irrelevant. 
24
Consistent with Rule 15.2 (Regulatory 
Revenues), the Exchange notes that should excess 
ORF revenue be collected prior to any reduction in 
an ORF rate, such excess revenue will not be used 
for nonregulatory purposes. 
liquid markets, which benefit all market 
participants including customers. 
Excluding Market Maker transactions 
from On-Exchange ORF will allow 
Market Makers to better manage their 
costs more effectively thus enabling 
them to better allocate resources toward 
technology, risk management, and 
capacity to ensure continued liquidity 
provision. 
In addition to the overall increase in 
Customer-range volume generally, 
regulating customer trading activity is 
more labor intensive and requires 
greater expenditure of human and 
technical resources than regulating non- 
customer trading activity, which tends 
to be more automated and less labor- 
intensive. For example, there are costs 
associated with main office and branch 
office examinations (e.g., staff and travel expenses), as well as investigations into 
customer complaints and terminations 
of Registered Persons. As a result, the 
costs associated with administering the 
customer component of the Exchange’s 
overall regulatory program are 
materially higher than the costs 
associated with administering the non- 
customer component (e.g., Clearing Member proprietary transactions) of its 
regulatory program.
21
While the 
Exchange notes that it has broad 
regulatory responsibilities with respect 
to its Members’ activities, irrespective of 
where their transactions take place, the 
Exchange believes it is reasonable to 
assess the proposed fee to only those 
transactions occurring on the Exchange. 
The proposed change more narrowly 
tailors the fee to products and 
transactions with a direct connection to 
the Exchange. Today, a customer 
transaction may be assessed an ORF 
from every options exchange totaling as 
much as $0.0187 per transaction per 
side.
22
While the Exchange’s proposed 
ORF rate under the proposed model of 
$0.00467 is higher than its current ORF 
rate of $0.0001 under the current model, 
if all exchanges adopted a similar on- 
exchange model, ORF rates may 
decrease for individual transactions 
overall because the proposed On- 
Exchange ORF will avoid overlapping 
ORFs that would otherwise be assessed 
by BZX Options and other options 
exchanges that also assess an ORF. With 
this proposal, transactions that would 
clear in the Customer range occurring 
on other exchanges would no longer be 
subject to an ORF assessed by BZX 
Options. 
The Exchange believes it is equitable 
and not unduly discriminatory to 
modify the method of collecting the fee 
such that On-Exchange ORF will not 
consider CMTAs reported directly to 
OCC as is done in today’s method of 
ORF. CMTA transfers are considered 
today under the current collection 
methodology for ORF as a convenience 
to industry members in administering a 
pass through of the fee to their 
customers. Limiting the On-Exchange 
ORF to transactions on the Exchange 
poses a limitation in the use of CMTA 
for this purpose. The Exchange 
understands that a CMTA may be added 
at order entry, via post-trade edit on the 
Exchange, or post-trade at OCC. CMTA 
transfers that occur at OCC do not 
necessarily contain reliable information 
regarding the Exchange on which the 
original transaction occurred.
23
Without 
specific information as to where the 
original transaction occurred, the 
Exchange would not be able to 
accurately account for CMTA transfers 
that occur at OCC. 
The Exchange also believes that the 
fact that a Consolidated Audit Trail 
(‘‘CAT’’) fee is in place should not 
preclude the Exchange from assessing 
On-Exchange ORF. The CAT is a 
repository of order, trade and customer 
information that is used as the basis for 
an audit trail of such activities. Like 
industry members, the exchanges, 
including BZX Options, also pays a CAT 
fee to support the operation and 
maintenance of CAT (in other words, it 
does not support regulatory work 
undertaken by exchanges). BZX Options 
does not include fees it pays for CAT in 
the regulatory expenses it looks to offset 
under ORF. Yes, the Exchange uses CAT 
data as part of its regulatory work, but 
only from an audit trail perspective. On- 
Exchange ORF, on the other hand, 
offsets the regulatory work the Exchange 
performs (using CAT data among other 
sources) such as surveillance, 
investigations, examinations, etc. The 
Exchange believes its fair and 
reasonable to assess an On-Exchange 
ORF in addition to fees associated with 
CAT. 
The Exchange further believes that the 
proposed change to the method for 
assessment and collection of the fee is 
reasonable because it would help ensure 
that revenue collected from the On- 
Exchange ORF, in combination with 
other regulatory fees and fines, would 
help offset, but not exceed, the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. As 
discussed, On-Exchange ORF is 
similarly designed to the current ORF, 
in that revenues generated from the fee 
would be less than or equal to 75% of 
the Exchange’s regulatory costs, which 
is consistent with the practice across the 
options industry today and the view of 
the Commission that regulatory fees be 
used for regulatory purposes and not to 
support the Exchange’s business side. 
As noted above, the Exchange will 
also continue to monitor on at least a 
semi-annual basis the amount of 
revenue collected from the On-Exchange 
ORF, even as amended, to ensure that it, 
in combination with its other regulatory 
fees and fines, does not exceed the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. If the 
Exchange determines regulatory 
revenues would exceed its regulatory 
costs in a given year, the Exchange will 
reduce the On-Exchange ORF by 
submitting a fee change filing to the 
Commission.
24
 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. This 
proposal does not create an unnecessary 
or inappropriate intra-market burden on 
competition because On-Exchange ORF 
applies to all customer activity on the 
Exchange, thereby raising regulatory 
revenue to offset regulatory expenses. It 
also supplements the regulatory revenue 
derived from non-customer activity. The 
Exchange notes, however, the proposed 
change is not designed to address any 
competitive issues. Indeed, this 
proposal does not create an unnecessary 
or inappropriate inter-market burden on 
competition because it is a regulatory 
fee that supports regulation in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
The Exchange is obligated to ensure that 
the amount of regulatory revenue 
collected from the On-Exchange ORF, in 
combination with its other regulatory 
fees and fines, does not exceed 
regulatory costs. In addition, the 
Exchange will not implement the On- 
Exchange ORF until all other options 
exchanges are prepared to adopt a 
similar model to avoid overlapping 
ORFs.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934,

and 
Rule 19b–4,
2
notice is hereby given that 
on December 4, 2025, ICE Clear Credit 
LLC (‘‘ICC’’ or ‘‘ICE Clear Credit’’) filed 
with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission the proposed rule change 
as described in Items I, II and III below, 
which Items have been primarily 
prepared by ICC. The Commission is 
publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change 
from interested persons. 
I. Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Terms of Substance of the Proposed 
Rule Change 
The principal purpose of the 
proposed rule change is to revise the 
ICC Risk Management Framework 
(‘‘RMF’’), ICC Risk Management Model 
Description (‘‘RMMD’’), and ICC End-of- 
Day Price Discovery Policies and 
Procedures (‘‘Pricing Policy’’). These 
revisions do not require any changes to 
the ICC Clearing Rules (the ‘‘Rules’’).

II. Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the 
Proposed Rule Change 
In its filing with the Commission, ICC 
included statements concerning the 
purpose of and basis for the proposed 
rule change, security-based swap 
submission, or advance notice and 
discussed any comments it received on 
the proposed rule change, security- 
based swap submission, or advance 
notice. The text of these statements may 
be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. ICC has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), 
and (C) below, of the most significant 
aspects of these statements. 
(A) Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the 
Proposed Rule Change 
(a) Purpose 
ICC proposes to enhance its liquidity 
charge methodology for credit default 
swap (‘‘CDS’’) index instruments by 
amending the RMF and RMMD. ICC also 
proposes additional updates to reflect 
current governance practices and make 
minor clean-up changes in the RMF, 
RMMD, and Pricing Policy. ICC believes 
that such revisions will facilitate the 
prompt and accurate clearance and 
settlement of securities transactions and 
derivative agreements, contracts, and 
transactions for which it is responsible. 
ICC proposes to make such changes 
effective following Commission 
approval of the proposed rule change. 
The proposed revisions are described in 
detail as follows. 
I. Index Liquidity Charge Enhancement 
ICC proposes to update its liquidity 
charge methodology for CDS index 
instruments. The liquidity charge 
represents one component of the Initial 
Margin (‘‘IM’’) requirement that ICC 
calculates for each Clearing Participant 
(‘‘CP’’) portfolio.
4
The liquidity charge 
incorporates the transaction costs 
associated with liquidating the portfolio 
of a defaulting CP under stress market 
conditions. More specifically, ICC 
estimates a liquidity charge for CDS 
index instruments by directly 
considering the bid-offer width 
(‘‘BOW’’) values used for ICC’s end-of- 
day price discovery process.
5
For each 
CDS index instrument, ICC maintains 
three predefined BOWs that correspond 
to one of three specific market regimes 
or levels. Level I is associated with

ICC adopted this approach to reflect that selling 
protection may carry more risk and incur higher 
cost of liquidation by exhibiting wider BOWs. The 
proposed changes would generally make the index 
liquidity charge methodology more conservative by 
using Level III conditions (extreme) for both long 
and short protection positions, instead of just for 
short protection positions. 
7
Symmetric BOWs apply the same Level III 
conditions for both long and short protection 
positions, whereas asymmetric BOWs apply 
different conditions (i.e., Level II conditions for long protection positions and Level III conditions 
for short protection positions). 
8
The CDS single name liquidity charge 
methodology incorporates a price-based BOW 
component to provide stability of requirements and 
a dynamic spread-based BOW component to reflect 
the additional risk associated with distressed 
market conditions. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 79220 (November 2, 2016), 81 FR 78677 
(November 8, 2016) (File No. SR–ICC–2016–010). 
9
ICC previously filed proposed rule changes to 
establish the Board Risk Committee and 
Nominating Committee. See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 103161 (May 30, 2025), 90 FR 
23970 (June 5, 2025) (File No. SR–ICC–2025–006) 
and 101820 (December 5, 2024), 89 FR 99917 
(December 11, 2024) (File No. SR–ICC–2024–010). 
10
Such change is consistent with ICC Rule 501 
that refers to the establishment of a CDS risk 
committee. 
11
See supra note 7.

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 103161 (May 30, 2025), 90 FR 23970, 23970 (June

Risk Committee would oversee (i) risk management 
models, systems, and processes used to identify and 
manage systemic, market, credit, and liquidity risks 
at ICC and (ii) matters that could materially affect 
the risk profile of ICC’’). The Board Risk Committee 
regularly reports its activities to the Board.

associated with market conditions that 
experience some measure of volatility, 
and Level III is associated with more 
extreme market conditions. The 
predefined BOW for Level I is smaller 
than the BOW for Level II, and the 
predefined BOW for Level II is smaller 
than the BOW for Level III. 
The current liquidity charge 
methodology for CDS index instruments 
assumes that short protection and long 
protection positions are liquidated at 
different BOWs. To estimate CDS index 
instrument liquidity charges, ICC uses 
Level II conditions (volatile) for long 
protection positions and Level III 
conditions (extreme) for short protection 
positions.
6
Under the proposed changes 
to the CDS index liquidity charge 
methodology, short protection and long 
protection positions would be 
liquidated at the same BOWs. 
Specifically, to estimate CDS index 
instrument liquidity charges, ICC would 
use Level III conditions for both long 
and short protection positions. 
ICC believes that the proposed 
changes would enhance the CDS index 
liquidity charge methodology. Such 
changes would simplify the 
methodology by making the 
methodology consistent for both CDS 
index and single name instruments by 
using symmetric BOWs
7
that reflect 
stress market conditions, which would 
promote ease of understanding of ICC’s 
methodology.
8
The proposed changes 
further promote the overall robustness 
of the liquidity charge methodology for 
CDS index instruments by using Level 
III conditions for long and short 
protection positions. 
To implement the changes ICC would 
update the RMF and RMMD as follows. 
Section IV.B.2 of the RMF states that 
ICC’s liquidity charge approach 
assumes, in general, that short 
protection and long protection positions 
are liquidated at different BOWs. 
Amended Section IV.B.2 would state 
that short protection and long protection 
positions are liquidated at the same 
BOWs. 
ICC proposes to similarly update the 
RMMD to reflect this change. ICC 
proposes to update the Table of 
Mathematical Symbols and Notations in 
the RMMD to remove symbols for BOW 
exposure for bought and sold protection 
positions. These symbols are no longer 
necessary as the amended methodology 
assumes that short protection and long 
protection positions are liquidated at 
the same BOWs. In Section II.2, ICC 
proposes to remove an equation and 
related language which uses these 
symbols to distinguish between the 
liquidation of short protection positions 
at Level III conditions and long 
protection positions at Level II 
conditions. ICC would remove reference 
to Level II conditions, as short 
protection and long protection positions 
would be liquidated at the same BOWs, 
namely, Level III conditions. Additional 
changes would also clarify that Levels I, 
II, and III range from normal to extreme 
market conditions. ICC also proposes a 
similar update in an equation that 
provides the liquidity charge calculation 
for CDS index instruments whose 
quoting convention is in price space. 
Such changes remove an equation and 
related language which distinguishes 
between the liquidation of short 
protection positions at Level III 
conditions and long protection positions 
at Level II conditions. 
II. Updates To Reflect Current 
Governance Practices and Minor Clean- 
Ups 
ICC proposes additional edits to 
reflect current ICC governance practices 
and make minor clean-up changes in the 
documentation. Specifically, ICC 
proposes adding references to the 
recently established ICC Board Risk 
Committee and ICC Nominating 
Committee in the RMF.
9
In Section II of 
the RMF, ICC proposes adding the 
Board Risk Committee and Nominating 
Committee to the list of relevant ICC 
committees for purposes of risk 
governance and to a chart showing ICC’s 
governance structure. ICC also proposes 
a minor edit to this chart to refer to the 
Risk Committee as the ‘‘CDS’’ Risk 
Committee to further distinguish it from 
the Board Risk Committee in the chart.
10
 
In Section II.A of the RMF, ICC would 
specify that there are nine committees 
which are integral to ICC’s risk 
management and add descriptions of the 
Board Risk Committee and Nominating 
Committee to reflect current 
responsibilities, as represented in other 
rule-filed documents or their charters, 
and re-number sections accordingly.
11
 
The proposed changes further specify 
items that are subject to Board Risk 
Committee review. Throughout the 
RMF, such items include policies and 
procedures, memoranda regarding CP 
membership applications, position or 
concentration limits, margin and 
guaranty fund levels, performance and 
composition of collateral, margin 
methodology changes, and model 
revisions. More specifically, certain 
periodic reporting would also be 
directed to the Board Risk Committee in 
place of the Board based on the 
committee’s mandate to assist the Board 
in fulfilling its oversight 
responsibilities.
12
ICC proposes similar 
changes to the ‘‘Initial Margin 
Methodology’’ Section of the RMMD 
and Section 3 of the Pricing Policy to 
specify that the RMMD and Pricing 
Policy, respectively, are subject to Board 
Risk Committee review at least 
annually, in addition to review by the 
Risk Committee and review and 
approval by the Board at least annually. 
Additionally, with respect to the Pricing 
Policy, ICC proposes minor clean-up 
changes to correct typographical errors 
to properly reflect table numbering 
throughout the document. 
(b) Statutory Basis 
ICC believes that the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the 
requirements of Section 17A of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’)
13
and the regulations thereunder 
applicable to it, including the applicable 
standards under Rule 17Ad–22.
14
In 
particular, Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the 
Act
15
requires, among other things, that 
the rules of a clearing agency be 
designed to promote the prompt and 
accurate clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions and, to the extent 
applicable, derivative agreements, 
contracts and transactions, to assure the

agency or for which it is responsible, 
and to protect investors and the public 
interest. 
The proposed amendments enhance 
ICC’s liquidity charge methodology for 
CDS index instruments by amending the 
RMF and RMMD. The proposed changes 
simplify ICC’s liquidity charge 
methodology by making the 
methodology consistent for both CDS 
index and single name instruments by 
using symmetric BOWs that reflect 
stress market conditions, which 
promotes ease of understanding of ICC’s 
methodology. ICC also proposes making 
additional updates to reflect current 
governance practices as well as other 
minor clean-up changes in the 
documentation. Such changes ensure 
that the documentation remains up-to- 
date, clear and transparent to support 
the effectiveness of ICC’s governance 
arrangements that support ICC’s risk 
management practices. Additionally, the 
proposed clean-ups to table numbering 
promote understanding and readability 
of the documentation, including with 
respect to ICC’s pricing practices. ICC 
believes that having policies and 
procedures that clearly and accurately 
document its risk management practices 
are an important component to the 
effectiveness of ICC’s risk management 
system and support ICC’s ability to 
maintain adequate financial resources, 
which promotes the prompt and 
accurate clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions, derivatives 
agreements, contracts, and transactions, 
the safeguarding of securities and funds 
in the custody or control of ICC or for 
which it is responsible, and the 
protection of investors and the public 
interest. Accordingly, in ICC’s view, the 
proposed rule change is designed to 
promote the prompt and accurate 
clearance and settlement of the 
contracts cleared at ICC, to assure the 
safeguarding of securities and funds in 
the custody or control of ICC or for 
which it is responsible, and to protect 
investors and the public interest, within 
the meaning of Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of 
the Act.
16
 
Rule 17Ad–22(e)(2)(i) and (v)
17
 
requires each covered clearing agency to 
establish, implement, maintain, and 
enforce written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to provide for 
governance arrangements that are clear 
and transparent and specify clear and 
direct lines of responsibility. As 
discussed above, the proposed changes 
reflect current ICC governance 
arrangements in the RMF, RMMD, and 
Pricing Policy. Specifically, ICC 
proposes adding references to the 
recently established Board Risk 
Committee and Nominating Committee. 
Such changes ensure that the RMF, 
RMMD, and Pricing Policy are up-to- 
date and clearly assign and document 
responsibility and accountability for 
relevant items to the Board Risk 
Committee and Nominating Committee. 
As such, in ICC’s view, the proposed 
rule change continues to ensure that ICC 
maintains policies and procedures that 
are reasonably designed to provide for 
clear and transparent governance 
arrangements and specify clear and 
direct lines of responsibility, consistent 
with Rule 17Ad–22(e)(2)(i) and (v).
18
 
Rule 17Ad–22(e)(3)(i)
19
requires ICC 
to establish, implement, maintain and 
enforce written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to maintain a 
sound risk management framework for 
comprehensively managing legal, credit, 
liquidity, operational, general business, 
investment, custody, and other risks 
that arise in or are borne by it, which 
includes risk management policies, 
procedures, and systems designed to 
identify, measure, monitor, and manage 
the range of risks that arise in or are 
borne by it, that are subject to review on 
a specified periodic basis and approved 
by the Board annually. The proposed 
updates would ensure clarity and 
transparency in the RMF, RMMD, and 
Pricing Policy by making minor clean- 
up changes to the documentation. The 
proposed updates would further ensure 
clarity and transparency regarding the 
review of the documents composing 
ICC’s risk management framework by 
the Board Risk Committee, which would 
promote the successful maintenance 
and operation of ICC’s risk management 
framework. As such, the amendments 
would satisfy the requirements of Rule 
17Ad–22(e)(3)(i).
20
 
Rule 17Ad–22(e)(4)(ii)
21
requires ICC 
to establish, implement, maintain, and 
enforce written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to effectively 
identify, measure, monitor, and manage 
its credit exposures to participants and 
those arising from its payment, clearing, 
and settlement processes, including by 
maintaining additional financial 
resources at the minimum to enable it 
to cover a wide range of foreseeable 
stress scenarios that include, but are not 
limited to, the default of the two 
participant families that would 
potentially cause the largest aggregate 
credit exposure for ICC in extreme but 
plausible market conditions. The 
proposed changes promote the 
soundness of the model, including by 
promoting the overall robustness of the 
liquidity charge methodology for index 
instruments by using Level III 
conditions for long and short protection 
positions, which would enhance ICC’s 
ability to manage risks and maintain 
appropriate financial resources. As 
such, the proposed amendments would 
strengthen ICC’s ability to maintain its 
financial resources and withstand the 
pressures of defaults, consistent with 
the requirements of Rule 17Ad– 
22(e)(4)(ii).
22
 
(B) Clearing Agency’s Statement on 
Burden on Competition 
ICC does not believe the proposed 
rule change would have any impact, or 
impose any burden, on competition. 
The proposed changes to the RMF, 
RMMD and Pricing Policy will apply 
uniformly across all market participants. 
ICC does not believe these amendments 
would affect the costs of clearing or the 
ability of market participants to access 
clearing. Therefore, ICC does not believe 
the proposed rule change would impose 
any burden on competition that is 
inappropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. 
(C) Clearing Agency’s Statement on 
Comments on the Proposed Rule 
Change Received from Members, 
Participants or Others 
Written comments relating to the 
proposed rule change have not been 
solicited or received. ICC will notify the 
Commission of any written comments 
received by ICC. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Within 45 days of the date of 
publication of this notice in the Federal 
Register or within such longer period up to 90 days (i) as the Commission may 
designate if it finds such longer period 
to be appropriate and publishes its 
reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which

Proposed Rule Change To Amend 
Options 7, Section 2 
December 15, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
1, 2025, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 
(‘‘Nasdaq’’ or ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘SEC’’ or ‘‘Commission’’) the proposed 
rule change as described in Items I, II, 
and III, below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend The 
Nasdaq Options Market LLC (‘‘NOM’’) 
Rules at Options 7, Section 2, Nasdaq 
Options Market—Fees and Rebates. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/nasdaq/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
NOM’s Pricing Schedule at Options 7, 
Section 2, Nasdaq Options Market— 
Fees and Rebates, with respect to a 
NOM Market Maker rebate. 
Pursuant to Options 7, Section 2(1), 
the Exchange currently assesses NOM 
Market Makers a $0.35 per contract Fee 
to Add Liquidity in Non-Penny 
Symbols. This fee applies unless 
Participants meet the volume thresholds 
set forth in note 5. Note 5 currently 
stipulates that, 
The NOM Market Maker Fee for Adding 
Liquidity in Non-Penny Symbols will apply 
unless Participants meet the volume 
thresholds set forth in this note. Participants 
that add NOM Market Maker liquidity in 
Non-Penny Symbols of 0.03% to 0.07% of 
total industry customer equity and ETF 
option ADV contracts per day in a month 
will be assessed a $0.00 per contract Non- 
Penny Options Fee for Adding Liquidity in 
that month. Participants that add NOM 
Market Maker liquidity in Non-Penny 
Symbols of above 0.07% to 0.10% of total 
industry customer equity and ETF option 
ADV contracts per day in a month will 
receive a Non-Penny Rebate to Add Liquidity 
of $0.30 per contract for that month instead 
of paying the Non-Penny Fee for Adding 
Liquidity. Participants that add NOM Market 
Maker liquidity in Non-Penny Symbols of 
above 0.10% of total industry customer 
equity and ETF option ADV contracts per day 
in a month will receive a Non-Penny Rebate 
to Add Liquidity of $0.40 per contract for 
that month instead of paying the Non-Penny 
Fee for Adding Liquidity. 
Accordingly, qualifying Participants 
are offered an opportunity to reduce the 
$0.35 Fee to Add Liquidity in Non- 
Penny Symbols or earn a rebate if they 
meet the volume-based requirements 
under note 5. 
The Exchange now proposes to amend 
the thresholds in note 5. Specifically, 
the Exchange proposes to provide that 
Participants that add NOM Market 
Maker liquidity in Non-Penny Symbols 
of 0.025% to 0.035% of total industry 
customer equity and ETF option ADV 
contracts per day in a month will be 
assessed a $0.00 per contract Non-Penny 
Options Fee for Adding Liquidity in that 
month. Further, the Exchange proposes 
that Participants that add NOM Market 
Maker liquidity in Non-Penny Symbols 
of above 0.035% to 0.075% of total 
industry customer equity and ETF 
option ADV contracts per day in a 
month will receive a Non-Penny Rebate 
to Add Liquidity of $0.30 per contract 
for that month instead of paying the 
Non-Penny Fee for Adding Liquidity. 
Finally, the Exchange proposes that 
Participants that add NOM Market 
Maker liquidity in Non-Penny Symbols 
of above 0.075% of total industry 
customer equity and ETF option ADV 
contracts per day in a month will 
receive a Non-Penny Rebate to Add 
Liquidity of $0.40 per contract for that

See Options 2, Sections 4 and 5. month instead of paying the Non-Penny 
Fee for Adding Liquidity. 
With this proposal, the Exchange is 
lowering the qualification requirements 
such that NOM Market Makers would be 
eligible for no Fee for Adding Liquidity 
in Non-Penny Symbols or a Non-Penny 
Rebate to Add Liquidity of $0.30 or 
$0.40 per contract in lieu of the Non- 
Penny Fee for Adding Liquidity. The 
Exchange believes that the note 5 
incentives will encourage NOM Market 
Makers to add additional Non-Penny 
Symbol liquidity on NOM which in turn 
will benefit of all Participants. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
3
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
4
in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges 
among members and issuers and other 
persons using any facility, and is not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Commission and the courts have 
repeatedly expressed their preference 
for competition over regulatory 
intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities 
markets. In Regulation NMS, while 
adopting a series of steps to improve the 
current market model, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO 
revenues and, also, recognized that 
current regulation of the market system 
‘‘has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
5
 
Likewise, in NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission
6
 
(‘‘NetCoalition’’) the D.C. Circuit upheld 
the Commission’s use of a market-based 
approach in evaluating the fairness of 
market data fees against a challenge 
claiming that Congress mandated a cost- 
based approach.
7
As the court 
emphasized, the Commission ‘‘intended 
in Regulation NMS that ‘market forces, 
rather than regulatory requirements’ 
play a role in determining the market 
data . . . to be made available to 
investors and at what cost.’’
8
 
Further, ‘‘[n]o one disputes that 
competition for order flow is ‘fierce.’ 
. . . As the SEC explained, ‘[i]n the U.S. 
national market system, buyers and 
sellers of securities, and the broker- 
dealers that act as their order-routing 
agents, have a wide range of choices of 
where to route orders for execution’; 
[and] ‘no exchange can afford to take its 
market share percentages for granted’ 
because ‘no exchange possesses a 
monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in 
the execution of order flow from broker 
dealers’....’’
9
Although the court and 
the SEC were discussing the cash 
equities markets, the Exchange believes 
that these views apply with equal force 
to the options markets. 
The Exchange’s proposal to amend 
the thresholds in note 5 is reasonable 
because the proposal lowers the 
qualification requirements such that 
NOM Market Makers would be eligible 
for no Fee for Adding Liquidity in Non- 
Penny Symbols or a Non-Penny Rebate 
to Add Liquidity of $0.30 or $0.40 per 
contract in lieu of the Non-Penny Fee 
for Adding Liquidity. The Exchange 
believes that the note 5 incentives will 
encourage NOM Market Makers to add 
additional Non-Penny Symbol liquidity 
on NOM which in turn will benefit of 
all Participants. 
The Exchange’s proposal to amend 
the thresholds in note 5 is equitable and 
not unfairly discriminatory because the 
Exchange will uniformly apply the 
qualifying thresholds to NOM Market 
Makers. All NOM Market Makers are 
eligible to receive the note 5 incentives 
for Non-Penny Symbols. The Exchange 
does not believe that it is unfairly 
discriminatory to offer the note 5 
incentives to only NOM Market Makers 
because these market participants add 
value through continuous quoting and 
the commitment of capital.
10
Because 
NOM Market Makers have these 
obligations to the market and regulatory 
requirements that normally do not apply 
to other market participants, the 
Exchange believes that offering the note 
5 incentives to only NOM Market 
Makers is equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory in light of their 
obligations. Finally, encouraging NOM 
Market Makers to add greater liquidity 
benefits all market participants in the 
quality of order interaction. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
Inter-Market Competition 
The proposal does not impose an 
undue burden on inter-market 
competition. The Exchange believes its 
proposal remains competitive with 
other options markets and will offer 
market participants with another venue 
in which to submit orders. The 
Exchange notes that it operates in a 
highly competitive market in which 
market participants can readily favor 
competing venues if they deem fee 
levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive, or rebate opportunities 
available at other venues to be more 
favorable. In such an environment, the 
Exchange must continually adjust its 
fees to remain competitive with other 
exchanges. Because competitors are free 
to modify their own fees in response, 
and because market participants may 
readily adjust their order routing 
practices, the Exchange believes that the 
degree to which fee changes in this 
market may impose any burden on 
competition is extremely limited. 
Intra-Market Competition 
The Exchange’s proposal to amend 
the thresholds in note 5 does not impose 
an undue burden on competition 
because the Exchange will uniformly 
apply the qualifying thresholds to all 
NOM Market Makers. All NOM Market 
Makers are eligible to receive the note 
5 incentives for Non-Penny Symbols. 
The Exchange does not believe the 
proposal will impose an undue burden 
on competition by offering the note 5 
incentives to only NOM Market Makers 
because these market participants add 
value through continuous quoting and 
the commitment of capital.
11
Because 
NOM Market Makers have these 
obligations to the market and regulatory 
requirements that normally do not apply 
to other market participants, the 
Exchange believes that offering the note 
5 incentives to only NOM Market 
Makers does not impose an undue 
burden on competition in light of their 
obligations. Finally, encouraging NOM 
Market Makers to add greater liquidity 
benefits all market participants in the 
quality of order interaction.

Rule Change To Amend Phlx Options 
7, Section 4 
December 15, 2025 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
1, 2025, Nasdaq PHLX LLC (‘‘Phlx’’ or 
‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’ or 
‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III, below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend the 
Monthly Market Maker Cap and 
Monthly Firm Fee Cap in Options 7, 
Section 4, Multiply Listed Options Fees 
(Includes options overlying equities, 
ETFs, ETNs and indexes which are 
Multiply Listed) (Excludes SPY and 
broad-based index options symbols 
listed within Options 7, Section 5.A). 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/phlx/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
Phlx proposes to amend its Pricing 
Schedule at Options 7, Section 4, 
Multiply Listed Options Fees (Includes 
options overlying equities, ETFs, ETNs 
and indexes which are Multiply Listed) 
(Excludes SPY and broad-based index 
options symbols listed within Options 
7, Section 5.A) to amend rule text 
related to the Monthly Market Maker 
Cap and the Monthly Firm Fee Cap. 
Each change is described below. 
Monthly Market Maker Cap 
Today, Lead Market Makers
3
and 
Market Makers
4
are subject to a 
‘‘Monthly Market Maker Cap’’ of 
$500,000 for: (i) electronic Option 
Transaction Charges, excluding 
surcharges and excluding options 
overlying broad-based index options 
symbols listed within Options 7, 
Section 5.A; and (ii) Qualified 
Contingent Cross (‘‘QCC’’) Transaction 
Fees (as defined in Exchange Options 3, 
Section 12 and Floor QCC Orders, as 
defined in Options 8, Section 30(e)).
5
 
Currently, all dividend, merger, short 
stock interest, reversal and conversion, 
jelly roll and box spread strategy 
executions (as defined in this Options 7, 
Section 4) are excluded from the 
Monthly Market Maker Cap. Further, 
today, Lead Market Makers or Market 
Makers that (i) are on the contra-side of 
an electronically-delivered and 
executed Customer order, excluding 
responses to a PIXL auction; and (ii) 
have reached the Monthly Market Maker

A Complex electronic auction includes, but is 
not limited to, an Exposure Complex Auction 
pursuant to Supplementary Material .01 to Options 
3, Section 14. Also, transactions which execute 
against an order for which the Exchange broadcast 
an order exposure alert or Exposure Complex 
Auction in an electronic auction will be subject to 
this fee. 
7
The term ‘‘Crossing Order’’ shall mean an order 
executed in the Facilitation Mechanism pursuant to 
Options 3, Section 11(b) or (c) or Solicited Order 
Mechanism pursuant to Options 3, Section 11(d) or 
(e). For purposes of this Pricing Schedule, orders 
executed in the Block Order Mechanism pursuant 
to Options 3, Section 11(a) are also considered 
Crossing Orders. See Options 7, Section 1(c). 8
FLEX Options are customized options contracts 
that allow investors to tailor contract terms for 
exchange-listed equity and index options. See Phlx Options 3A. 
9
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 104031 (September 24, 2025), 90 FR 46682 (September 29, 
2025) (SR–Phlx–2025–48) (Notice of Filing and 
Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change 
To Establish Pricing for New Functionality). 
10
This new functionality is being migrated to 
Phlx’s trading platform over a five week timeframe 
on a symbol by symbol basis. The migration will 
be complete on December 8, 2025. See https://
www.nasdaqtrader.com/ 
MicroNews.aspx?id=OTA2025-32. 
11
The Facilitation Mechanism would permit a 
Phlx member to execute a transaction wherein the 
member seeks to facilitate a block-size order it 
represents as agent (‘‘agency order’’), and/or a 
transaction wherein the member solicited interest to 
execute against a block-size order it represents as 
agent (‘‘Facilitation Order’’) as described in Options 
3, Section 11(b) and (c). This mechanism allows 
members the flexibility to represent a transaction 
where the member is facilitating only a portion of 
the order and has solicited interest from other 
parties for the other portion of the order. The 
Solicited Order Mechanism or ‘‘SOM’’ is a process 
by which a member can attempt to execute orders 
of 500 or more contracts it represents as agent (the 
‘‘Agency Order’’) against contra orders that it 
solicited pursuant to Options 3, Section 11(d) and 
(e). Each order entered into the SOM shall be 
designated as all-or-none. The Block Order 
Mechanism provides a means for handling ‘‘block- 
sized orders’’ (i.e., orders for fifty (50) contracts or more) pursuant to Options 3, Section 11(a). 
12
ISE does not offer a market maker cap. 
13
The term ‘‘Firm’’ applies to any transaction that 
is identified by a member or member organization 
for clearing in the Firm range at OCC. See Options 7, Section 1(c).

purposes of this fee, the opening

The Exchange proposes to amend the 
rule text by relocating current text and 
adding new text. The Exchange propose 
to state: Lead Market Makers and Market 
Makers are subject to a ‘‘Monthly 
Market Maker Cap’’ of $500,000 for: 
; electronic Option Transaction Charges, excluding: (i) surcharges; (ii) 
options overlying broad-based index 
options symbols listed (as defined in 
Options 7, Section 5.A), (iii) dividend, 
merger, short stock interest, reversal and 
conversion, jelly roll and box spread 
strategy executions (as defined in this 
Options 7, Section 4); (iv) Crossing 
Order Fees (as defined in Options 7, 
Section 6, F); and (v) FLEX Electronic 
Transaction Fees (as defined in Options 
7, Section 6, B); and 
; QCC Transaction Fees (as defined in this Options 7, Section 4). 
For this section of the Pricing 
Schedule, the Exchange is relocating 
rule text concerning dividend, merger, 
short stock interest, reversal and 
conversion, jelly roll and box spread 
strategy executions without substantive 
change. The Exchange proposes 
exclusions for Crossing Order
7
Fees and 
FLEX
8
Electronic Transaction Fees in 
the added rule text. The Exchange 
recently adopted new pricing to Phlx’s 
Pricing Schedule related to its new 
functionality
9
that was similar to 
pricing on Nasdaq ISE, LLC (‘‘ISE’’). 
Among other changes, SR–Phlx–2025– 
48 adopted pricing
10
for its (1) new 
electronic FLEX functionality pursuant 
to Options 3A, (2) Facilitation 
Mechanism pursuant to Options 3, 
Section 11(b) and (c), (3) Solicited Order 
Mechanism pursuant to Options 3, 
Section 11(d) and (e), and (4) Block 
Order Mechanism pursuant to Options 
3, Section 11(a).
11
The Exchange 
inadvertently did not include rule text 
about the new pricing for Crossing 
Order Fees and FLEX Electronic 
Transaction Fees with respect to the 
Monthly Market Maker Cap.
12
At this 
time, the Exchange proposes to note that 
Crossing Order Fees and FLEX 
Electronic Transaction Fees are 
excluded from the Monthly Market 
Maker Cap. 
The Exchange also proposes to update 
the citations to the pricing that is being 
referenced in the Monthly Market Maker 
Cap and also conforming the format of 
the citations to that pricing. 
Monthly Firm Fee Cap 
Today, Firms
13
are subject to a 
$250,000 ‘‘Monthly Firm Fee Cap.’’ 
Firm Floor Option Transaction Charges 
and QCC Transaction Fees, in the 
aggregate, for one billing month that 
exceed the Monthly Firm Fee Cap per 
member or member organization, when 
such members or member organizations 
are trading in their own proprietary 
account, are subject to a reduced 
transaction fee of $0.02 per capped 
contract unless there is no fee or the fee 
is waived. Today, all dividend, merger, 
short stock interest, reversal and 
conversion, jelly roll, and box spread 
strategy executions (as defined in this 
Options 7, Section 4) are excluded from 
the Monthly Firm Fee Cap. Today, 
transactions in broad-based index 
options symbols listed within Options 
7, Section 5.A. are excluded from the 
Monthly Firm Fee Cap. Finally, today, 
QCC Transaction Fees are included in 
the calculation of the Monthly Firm Fee 
Cap. 
At this time, as the Monthly Firm Fee 
Cap currently applies to Firm Floor 
Options Transaction Charges, the 
Exchange proposes to specifically note 
that ‘‘Electronic Options Transaction 
Charges are excluded from the Monthly 
Firm Fee Cap.’’ The Exchange notes that 
this proposed text does not 
substantively amend the Monthly Firm 
Fee Cap, rather it will complete the list 
of excluded transaction charges. Finally, 
the Exchange proposes to add a citation 
for QCC Transaction Charges. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
14
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
15
in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges 
among members and issuers and other 
persons using any facility, and is not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Commission and the courts have 
repeatedly expressed their preference 
for competition over regulatory 
intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities 
markets. In Regulation NMS, while 
adopting a series of steps to improve the 
current market model, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO 
revenues and, also, recognized that 
current regulation of the market system 
‘‘has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
16
 
Likewise, in NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission
17
 
(‘‘NetCoalition’’) the D.C. Circuit upheld 
the Commission’s use of a market-based 
approach in evaluating the fairness of 
market data fees against a challenge 
claiming that Congress mandated a cost-

based approach.
18
As the court 
emphasized, the Commission ‘‘intended 
in Regulation NMS that ‘market forces, 
rather than regulatory requirements’ 
play a role in determining the market 
data . . . to be made available to 
investors and at what cost.’’
19
 
Further, ‘‘[n]o one disputes that 
competition for order flow is ‘fierce.’ 
. . . As the SEC explained, ‘[i]n the U.S. 
national market system, buyers and 
sellers of securities, and the broker- 
dealers that act as their order-routing 
agents, have a wide range of choices of 
where to route orders for execution’; 
[and] ‘no exchange can afford to take its 
market share percentages for granted’ 
because ‘no exchange possesses a 
monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in 
the execution of order flow from broker 
dealers’....’’
20
Although the court 
and the SEC were discussing the cash 
equities markets, the Exchange believes 
that these views apply with equal force 
to the options markets. 
Monthly Market Maker Cap 
The Exchange’s proposal to relocate 
and amend current rule text is 
reasonable, equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory because the revised rule 
text makes clear what rule text is 
included and excluded in a transparent 
manner with citations to the rule text. 
The Exchange’s proposal to add new 
rule text to exclude Crossing Order Fees 
and FLEX Electronic Transaction Fees 
from the Monthly Market Maker Cap is 
reasonable. The recently adopted
21
 
auction pricing for Crossing Order Fees 
and FLEX Electronic Transaction Fees 
needs to be addressed for purposes of 
the Monthly Market Maker Cap. In 
terms of auction pricing, PIXL is the 
only other auction on Phlx and it is 
explicitly addressed in the rule text. The 
remainder of the pricing that is 
discussed in the Monthly Market Maker 
cap is order book pricing. Excluding 
these auctions (Crossing Order Fees and 
FLEX Electronic Transaction Fees) is 
reasonable because the pricing is new 
and the Phlx migration is not 
complete.
22
Phlx is seeking to encourage 
market participants to utilize this new 
functionality which is currently not 
available for all symbols until the 
migration is complete on December 8, 
2025. Once the migration is complete, 
Phlx will consider whether to amend its 
cap to include the auctions or certain 
auction transactions to encourage 
greater activity in the auctions. Further, 
when Phlx adopted the pricing in SR– 
Phlx–2025–48 it was mirroring pricing 
offered on ISE. ISE does not offer a 
similar market maker cap. 
The Exchange’s proposal to add new 
rule text to exclude Crossing Order Fees 
and FLEX Electronic Transaction Fees 
from the Monthly Market Maker Cap is 
equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory because the Exchange 
would exclude Crossing Order Fees and 
FLEX Electronic Transaction Fees from 
the Monthly Market Maker Cap in a 
uniform manner for all Phlx members 
and member organizations. 
Monthly Firm Fee Cap 
The Exchange’s proposal to 
specifically note that electronic Options 
Transaction Charges are excluded from 
the Monthly Firm Fee Cap and add a 
citation for QCC Transaction Charges is 
reasonable, equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory as these amendments are 
non-substantive technical amendments 
to further clarify existing rule text. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
Inter-Market Competition 
The proposal does not impose an 
undue burden on inter-market 
competition. The Exchange believes its 
proposal remains competitive with 
other options markets and will offer 
market participants with another choice 
of where to transact options. The 
Exchange notes that it operates in a 
highly competitive market in which 
market participants can readily favor 
competing venues if they deem fee 
levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive, or rebate opportunities 
available at other venues to be more 
favorable. In such an environment, the 
Exchange must continually adjust its 
fees to remain competitive with other 
exchanges. Because competitors are free 
to modify their own fees in response, 
and because market participants may 
readily adjust their order routing 
practices, the Exchange believes that the 
degree to which fee changes in this 
market may impose any burden on 
competition is extremely limited. 
Intra-Market Competition 
The Exchange’s proposal to add new 
rule text to exclude Crossing Order Fees 
and FLEX Electronic Transaction Fees 
from the Monthly Market Maker Cap 
does not impose an undue burden on 
competition because the Exchange 
would exclude Crossing Order Fees and 
FLEX Electronic Transaction Fees from 
the Monthly Market Maker Cap in a 
uniform manner for all Phlx members 
and member organizations. 
The Exchange’s proposal to 
specifically note that electronic Options 
Transaction Charges are excluded from 
the Monthly Firm Fee Cap and add a 
citation for QCC Transaction Charges 
does not impose an undue burden on 
competition because these amendments 
are non-substantive technical 
amendments to further clarify existing 
rule text. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act.
23
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is: (i) necessary or appropriate in 
the public interest; (ii) for the protection 
of investors; or (iii) otherwise in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
If the Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule

Self-Regulatory Organizations; The

Proposed Rule Change To Amend Rule

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that, on December

(‘‘Nasdaq’’ or ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I and II 
below, which Items have been prepared 
by the Exchange. The Commission is 
publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change 
from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Rule 5215 to allow the listing of 
American Depositary Receipts of 
Canadian companies.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of, and basis for, 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
Currently, the Exchange allows for the 
listing of American Depositary Receipts 
(‘‘ADRs’’) that represent shares in a 
foreign Company pursuant to Rule 5215 
but excludes the listing of Canadian 
ADRs on the Exchange. More 
specifically, ADRs can be listed on 
Nasdaq provided they represent shares 
in a non-Canadian foreign Company. 
Rule 5215 applies to all three tiers of the 
Exchange’s listing markets. Nasdaq 
believes that the exclusion of Canadian 
companies is based on historic issuer 
preferences, because Canadian 
companies have preferred to utilize the 
Commission’s Multijurisdictional 
Disclosure System (‘‘MJDS’’)
3
to 
streamline the listing process and list 
their securities directly with the 
Exchange through ordinary shares. 
While the MJDS process provides 
Canadian companies with a 
straightforward approach for listing, 
Nasdaq has recently been approached 
by advisors to Canadian companies, 
who indicated that certain companies 
would prefer to list in the format of 
ADRs. The Exchange does not believe 
there is any reason to continue to 
exclude Canadian companies from 
listing ADRs and is therefore proposing 
to amend Rule 5215 accordingly. More 
specifically, the Exchange proposes to 
remove the term ‘‘non-Canadian’’ from 
Rule 5215(a). The Exchange notes that 
this would align Nasdaq rules with 
those of other exchanges, which 
currently allow for the listing of 
Canadian ADRs.
4
Similar to all foreign 
issuers, all Canadian companies that 
issue ADRs will be required to maintain 
compliance with the applicable 
Exchange listing requirements pursuant 
to Rules 5300 through 5500 and the 
governance requirements pursuant to 
Nasdaq Rule 5600. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
5
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
6
 
in particular, in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general to protect 
investors and the public interest and is 
not designed to permit unfair 
discrimination, by removing an 
unnecessary restriction on which 
foreign private issuers may utilize ADRs 
as a format for listing their securities. 
In particular, the Exchange believes 
that removing the term ‘‘non-Canadian’’

17 CFR 240.19b–4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6) requires a self-regulatory organization to give 
the Commission written notice of its intent to file 
the proposed rule change at least five business days 
prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule 
change, or such shorter time as designated by the 
Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this 
requirement.

from Rule 5215 will place Canadian 
foreign private issuers on equal footing 
with all other foreign private issuers by 
providing equal eligibility to list ADRs. 
While the MJDS provides Canadian 
issuers with a path for listing ordinary 
shares, the Exchange believes that 
removing the impediment that prevents 
Canadian issuers from listing ADRs on 
the Exchange will provide such issuers 
with the same listing options as other 
foreign private issuers and the same 
listing options for Canadian ADRs as 
provided by other exchanges. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. Any foreign 
private issuer that desires to list ADRs 
on the Exchange can do so on a non- 
discriminatory basis as long as the 
foreign private issuer also maintains 
compliance with the applicable 
Exchange listing and governance 
requirements. There is no inter-market 
burden on competition because the 
proposed amendment is aligned with 
the rule on other exchanges that do not 
exclude the listing of Canadian ADRs 
and the proposal does not impose any 
burden on the ability for other 
exchanges to compete.
7
Additionally, 
there is no burden to intra-market 
competition because the proposed 
change will apply to all Canadian 
issuers and will put such issuers on 
equal footing with other foreign private 
issuers. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were solicited 
or received with respect to the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: (i) significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant 
burden on competition; and (iii) become 
operative for 30 days from the date on 
which it was filed, or such shorter time 
as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act
8
and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b–4 
thereunder.
9
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is: (i) necessary or appropriate in 
the public interest; (ii) for the protection 
of investors; or (iii) otherwise in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
If the Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

Exchange notes that the origin type of the order 
‘‘Public Customer that is not a Priority Customer’’ 
in the MIAX Options Fee Schedule is substantively 
similar to the origin type of the order ‘‘Professional’’ 
in the MEMX Options Fee Schedule. The term 
‘‘Public Customer’’ means a person that is not a 
broker or dealer in securities. The term ‘‘Priority 
Customer’’ means a person or entity that (i) is not 
a broker or dealer in securities, and (ii) does not 
place more than 390 orders in listed options per day 
on average during a calendar month for its own 
beneficial account(s). See Exchange Rule 100. The term ‘‘Professional’’ means any person or entity that 
(A) is not a broker or dealer in securities; and (B) 
places more than 390 orders in listed options per 
day on average during a calendar month for its own 
beneficial account(s). See Rules of MEMX, Rule 16.1, available at https://info.memxtrading.com/ wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MEMX-Rulebook-

the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend the 
exchange grouping of options exchanges 
within the routing fee table in Section 
1)b) of the Fee Schedule, Fees for 
Customer Orders Routed to Another 
Options Exchange, to adjust the 
groupings of options exchanges. 
Background 
Currently, the Exchange assesses 
routing fees based upon (i) the origin 
type of the order; (ii) whether or not it 
is an order for standard option classes 
in the Penny Interval Program
3
(‘‘Penny 
classes’’) or an order for standard option 
classes which are not in the Penny 
Interval Program (‘‘Non-Penny classes’’) 
(or other explicitly identified classes); 
and (iii) to which away market it is 
being routed. This assessment practice 
is identical to the routing fees 
assessment practice currently utilized 
by the Exchange’s affiliates, Miami 
International Securities Exchange, LLC 
(‘‘MIAX’’), MIAX PEARL, LLC (‘‘MIAX 
Pearl’’), and MIAX Sapphire, LLC 
(‘‘MIAX Sapphire’’). This is also similar 
to the methodology utilized by the Cboe 
BZX Exchange, Inc. (‘‘Cboe BZX 
Options’’), a competing options 
exchange, in assessing routing fees. 
Cboe BZX Options has exchange 
groupings in its fee schedule, similar to 
those of the Exchange, whereby several 
exchanges are grouped into the same 
category dependent upon the order’s 
origin type and whether it is a Penny or 
Non-Penny class.
4
 
As a result of conducting a periodic 
review of the current transaction fees 
charged by away markets the Exchange 
has determined to amend the exchange 
groupings of options exchanges within 
the routing fee table to better reflect the 
associated costs and fees of routing 
customer orders to certain away markets 
for execution. 
Proposal 
The Exchange proposes to amend the 
table in Section 1)b) of the Exchange’s 
Fee Schedule, Fees for Customer Orders 
Routed to Another Options Exchange, to 
update the exchange groupings of 
options exchanges within the routing 
fee table. Under this proposed change, 
the Exchange will not amend the fees 
associated with the exchange groupings. 
This proposal merely seeks to amend 
the exchange groupings, which change 
is reflected in the routing fee table 
below and described in detail herein.

Options, MEMX ................................................................................................................................................................................ 1.40 The Exchange proposes to remove 
‘‘MEMX’’ from the ‘‘Routed, Public 
Customer that is not a Priority 
Customer, Non-Penny Program’’ $1.25 
fee tier and amend the ‘‘Routed, Public 
Customer that is not a Priority 
Customer, Non-Penny Program’’ $1.40 
fee tier to add ‘‘MEMX’’. This change is 
being made as MEMX LLC (‘‘MEMX’’) 
recently amended its fee schedule and 
now assesses a transaction fee of $1.21 
per contract for orders in Non-Penny 
classes in Professional capacities which 
remove liquidity from the MEMX 
Options Book.
5
 
The purpose of the proposal is to 
adjust the routing fee groups for orders 
routed to other exchanges to better 
reflect the associated costs for that 
routed execution in Penny and Non- 
Penny classes as determined by the fees 
and rebates at the executing exchange. 
In determining to amend its groupings, 
the Exchange took into account 
transaction fees assessed by the away 
market to which the Exchange routes 
orders, as well as the Exchange’s 
clearing costs, administrative, 
regulatory, and technical costs 
associated with routing orders to an 
away market. The Exchange uses 
unaffiliated routing brokers to route 
orders to the away markets; the costs 
associated with the use of these services 
are included in the routing fees 
specified in the Fee Schedule. This

See supra note 4. The Cboe BZX Options fee 
schedule has exchange groupings, whereby several 
exchanges are grouped into the same category, 
dependent on the order’s origin type and whether 
it is a Penny or Non-Penny class. 
7
This amount is to cover de minimis differences/ 
changes to away market fees (i.e., minor increases or decreases) that would not necessitate a fee filing 
by the Exchange to re-categorize the away exchange 
into a different grouping. Routing fees are not 
intended to be a profit center for the Exchange and 
the Exchange’s goal regarding routing fees and 
expenses is to be as close as possible to net neutral. 
8
The term ‘‘Member’’ means an individual or 
organization approved to exercise the trading rights 
associated with a Trading Permit. Members are 
deemed ‘‘members’’ under the Exchange Act. See 
Exchange Rule 100.

routing fee structure is not only similar 
to the Exchange’s affiliates, MIAX, 
MIAX Pearl, and MIAX Sapphire, but is 
also comparable to the structure in place 
on at least one other competing options 
exchange, Cboe BZX Options.
6
The 
Exchange’s routing fee structure 
approximates the Exchange’s costs 
associated with routing orders to away 
markets. The per-contract transaction 
fee amount associated with each 
grouping closely approximates the 
Exchange’s all-in cost (plus an 
additional, non-material amount)
7
to 
execute that corresponding contract at 
that corresponding exchange. 
The Exchange notes that in 
determining whether to adjust certain 
groupings of options exchanges in the 
routing fee table, the Exchange 
considered the transaction fees assessed 
by away markets, and determined to 
amend the grouping of exchanges that 
assess transaction fees for routed orders 
within a similar range. This same logic 
and structure apply to all of the 
groupings in the routing fee table. By 
utilizing the same structure that is 
utilized by the Exchange’s affiliates, 
MIAX, MIAX Pearl, and MIAX 
Sapphire, the Exchange’s Members
8
 
will be assessed routing fees in a similar 
manner. The Exchange notes that its 
affiliates, MIAX, MIAX Pearl, and MIAX 
Sapphire, will file to make the same 
proposed routing fee changes contained 
herein. 
Implementation 
The proposed rule changes will 
become effective on December 1, 2025. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal to amend its Fee Schedule is 
consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act
9
 
in general, and furthers the objectives of 
Section 6(b)(4) of the Act
10
in 
particular, in that it is an equitable 
allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and 
other charges among its members and 
issuers and other persons using its 
facilities. The Exchange also believes 
the proposal furthers the objectives of 
Section 6(b)(5) of the Act
11
in that it is 
designed to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in 
general to protect investors and the 
public interest and is not designed to 
permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers and dealers. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed changes to the exchange 
groupings of options exchanges within 
the routing fee table furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(4) of the Act 
and is reasonable, equitable and not 
unfairly discriminatory because the 
proposed change will continue to apply 
in the same manner to all Members that 
are subject to routing fees. The 
Exchange believes the proposed changes 
to the routing fee table exchange 
groupings furthers the objectives of 
Section 6(b)(5) of the Act and is 
designed to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade and is not unfairly 
discriminatory because the proposed 
changes seek to recoup costs that are 
incurred by the Exchange when routing 
orders for Public Customers that are not 
Priority Customers to away markets on 
behalf of Members and does so in the 
same manner for all Members that are 
subject to routing fees. The costs to the 
Exchange to route orders to away 
markets for execution primarily 
includes transaction fees assessed by the 
away markets to which the Exchange 
routes orders, in addition to the 
Exchange’s clearing costs, 
administrative, regulatory and technical 
costs. The Exchange believes that the 
proposed re-categorization of certain 
exchange groupings would enable the 
Exchange to better reflect the costs and 
fees associated with routing orders to 
other exchanges for execution. 
The Exchange places away markets in 
the fee tier grouping that best 
approximates the Exchange’s costs and 
fees to route the orders in that segment 
to that away market. The per-contract 
transaction fee amount associated with 
each grouping approximates the 
Exchange’s all-in cost (plus an 
additional, non-material amount)
12
to 
execute the corresponding contract at 
the corresponding exchange. The 
Exchange believes its tier structure 
represents the best approach to reflect 
the costs and fees associated with 
routing and executing orders on other 
exchanges. As noted above, this routing 
fee structure is comparable to the 
structure in place on at least one other 
competing options exchange, Cboe BZX 
Options.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
Exchange’s proposed re-categorization 
of certain exchange groupings is 
intended to enable the Exchange to 
recover the costs it incurs to route 
orders to away markets. The costs to the 
Exchange to route orders to away 
markets for execution primarily 
includes the transaction fees assessed by 
the away markets to which the 
Exchange routes orders, in addition to 
the Exchange’s clearing costs, 
administrative, regulatory and technical 
costs. The Exchange does not believe 
that this proposal imposes any 
unnecessary burden on competition 
because it seeks to better reflect the 
costs and fees incurred by the Exchange 
when routing orders to away markets on 
behalf of Members and notes that at 
least one other options exchange has a 
similar routing fee structure.

Rule Change To Amend the MIAX

Schedule To Regroup Options 
Exchanges Within the Routing Fee 
Table 
December 15, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (‘‘Act’’ 
or ‘‘Exchange Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 
thereunder,
2
notice is hereby given that 
on December 1, 2025, MIAX Sapphire, 
LLC (‘‘MIAX Sapphire’’ or ‘‘Exchange’’) 
filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (‘‘Commission’’) the 
proposed rule change as described in 
Items I, II, and III below, which Items 
have been prepared by the Exchange. 
The Commission is publishing this 
notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change from interested 
persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend the 
MIAX Sapphire Options Exchange Fee 
Schedule (‘‘Fee Schedule’’) to amend 
the MIAX Sapphire Options Exchange 
Fee Schedule (the ‘‘Fee Schedule’’). 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/ 
us-options/all-options-exchanges/rule- 
filings, and at MIAX Sapphire’s principal office. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend the 
exchange grouping of options exchanges 
within the routing fee table in Section 
1)b) of the Fee Schedule, Fees and 
Rebates for Customer Orders Routed to 
Another Options Exchange, to adjust the 
groupings of options exchanges. In 
addition, the Exchange proposes to 
make a minor, non-substantive change 
to the heading of Section 1)b) of the Fee 
Schedule. 
Background 
Currently, the Exchange assesses 
routing fees based upon (i) the origin 
type of the order; (ii) whether or not it 
is an order for standard option classes 
in the Penny Interval Program
3
(‘‘Penny 
classes’’) or an order for standard option 
classes which are not in the Penny 
Interval Program (‘‘Non-Penny classes’’) 
(or other explicitly identified classes); 
and (iii) to which away market it is 
being routed. This assessment practice 
is identical to the routing fees 
assessment practice currently utilized 
by the Exchange’s affiliates, Miami 
International Securities Exchange, LLC 
(‘‘MIAX’’), MIAX PEARL, LLC (‘‘MIAX 
Pearl’’), and MIAX Emerald, LLC 
(‘‘MIAX Emerald’’). This is also similar 
to the methodology utilized by the Cboe 
BZX Exchange, Inc. (‘‘Cboe BZX 
Options’’), a competing options 
exchange, in assessing routing fees. 
Cboe BZX Options has exchange 
groupings in its fee schedule, similar to 
those of the Exchange, whereby several 
exchanges are grouped into the same 
category dependent upon the order’s 
origin type and whether it is a Penny or 
Non-Penny class.
4
 
As a result of conducting a periodic 
review of the current transaction fees 
charged by away markets the Exchange 
has determined to amend the exchange 
groupings of options exchanges within 
the routing fee table to better reflect the 
associated costs and fees of routing 
customer orders to certain away markets 
for execution. 
Proposal 
The Exchange proposes to amend the 
table in Section 1)b) of the Exchange’s 
Fee Schedule, Fees and Rebates for 
Customer Orders Routed to Another

See MEMX Options Fee Schedule (effective August 1, 2025), Transaction Fees, available at 
https://info.memxtrading.com/us-options-trading- 
resources/us-options-fee-schedule/ (last visited November 23, 2025); see also Securities Exchange 
Act Release No. 100804 (August 22, 2024), 89 FR 
68956 (August 28, 2024) (SR–MEMX–2024–32). The 
Exchange notes that the origin type of the order 
‘‘Public Customer that is not a Priority Customer’’ 
in the MIAX Options Fee Schedule is substantively 
similar to the origin type of the order ‘‘Professional’’ 
in the MEMX Options Fee Schedule. The term 
‘‘Public Customer’’ means a person that is not a 
broker or dealer in securities. The term ‘‘Priority 
Customer’’ means a person or entity that (i) is not 
a broker or dealer in securities, and (ii) does not 
place more than 390 orders in listed options per day 
on average during a calendar month for its own 
beneficial account(s). See Exchange Rule 100. The term ‘‘Professional’’ means any person or entity that 
(A) is not a broker or dealer in securities; and (B) 
places more than 390 orders in listed options per 
day on average during a calendar month for its own 
beneficial account(s). See Rules of MEMX, Rule 16.1, available at https://info.memxtrading.com/ wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MEMX-Rulebook- 
9.16.25-Clean.pdf (last visited November 23, 2025). 6
See supra note 4. The Cboe BZX Options fee 
schedule has exchange groupings, whereby several 
exchanges are grouped into the same category, 
dependent on the order’s origin type and whether 
it is a Penny or Non-Penny class. 
7
This amount is to cover de minimis differences/ 
changes to away market fees (i.e., minor increases or decreases) that would not necessitate a fee filing 
by the Exchange to re-categorize the away exchange 
into a different grouping. Routing fees are not 
intended to be a profit center for the Exchange and 
the Exchange’s goal regarding routing fees and 
expenses is to be as close as possible to net neutral. 
8
The term ‘‘Member’’ means an individual or 
organization that is registered with the Exchange 
pursuant to Chapter II of these Rules for purposes 
of trading on the Exchange as an ‘‘Electronic 
Exchange Member’’ or ‘‘Market Maker.’’ Members 
are deemed ‘‘members’’ under the Exchange Act. 
See Exchange Rule 100. Options Exchange, to update the 
exchange groupings of options 
exchanges within the routing fee table. 
Under this proposed change, the 
Exchange will not amend the fees 
associated with the exchange groupings. 
This proposal merely seeks to amend 
the exchange groupings, which change 
is reflected in the routing fee table 
below and described in detail herein.

Options, MEMX ................................................................................................................................................................................ 1.40 The Exchange proposes to remove 
‘‘MEMX’’ from the ‘‘Routed, Public 
Customer that is not a Priority 
Customer, Non-Penny Program’’ $1.25 
fee tier and amend the ‘‘Routed, Public 
Customer that is not a Priority 
Customer, Non-Penny Program’’ $1.40 
fee tier to add ‘‘MEMX’’. This change is 
being made as MEMX LLC (‘‘MEMX’’) 
recently amended its fee schedule and 
now assesses a transaction fee of $1.21 
per contract for orders in Non-Penny 
classes in Professional capacities which 
remove liquidity from the MEMX 
Options Book.
5
 
The purpose of the proposal is to 
adjust the routing fee groups for orders 
routed to other exchanges to better 
reflect the associated costs for that 
routed execution in Penny and Non- 
Penny classes as determined by the fees 
and rebates at the executing exchange. 
In determining to amend its groupings, 
the Exchange took into account 
transaction fees assessed by the away 
market to which the Exchange routes 
orders, as well as the Exchange’s 
clearing costs, administrative, 
regulatory, and technical costs 
associated with routing orders to an 
away market. The Exchange uses 
unaffiliated routing brokers to route 
orders to the away markets; the costs 
associated with the use of these services 
are included in the routing fees 
specified in the Fee Schedule. This 
routing fee structure is not only similar 
to the Exchange’s affiliates, MIAX, 
MIAX Pearl, and MIAX Emerald, but is 
also comparable to the structure in place 
on at least one other competing options 
exchange, Cboe BZX Options.
6
The 
Exchange’s routing fee structure 
approximates the Exchange’s costs 
associated with routing orders to away 
markets. The per-contract transaction 
fee amount associated with each 
grouping closely approximates the 
Exchange’s all-in cost (plus an 
additional, non-material amount)
7
to 
execute that corresponding contract at 
that corresponding exchange. 
The Exchange notes that in 
determining whether to adjust certain 
groupings of options exchanges in the 
routing fee table, the Exchange 
considered the transaction fees assessed 
by away markets, and determined to 
amend the grouping of exchanges that 
assess transaction fees for routed orders 
within a similar range. This same logic 
and structure apply to all of the 
groupings in the routing fee table. By 
utilizing the same structure that is 
utilized by the Exchange’s affiliates, 
MIAX, MIAX Pearl, and MIAX Emerald, 
the Exchange’s Members
8
will be 
assessed routing fees in a similar 
manner. The Exchange notes that its 
affiliates, MIAX, MIAX Pearl, and MIAX 
Emerald, will file to make the same 
proposed routing fee changes contained 
herein. 
In addition, the Exchange proposes to 
make a minor, non-substantive change 
to the heading of Section 1)b) of the Fee 
Schedule. Specifically, the Exchange 
proposes to amend the heading of 
Section 1)b) of the Fee Schedule from 
‘‘Fees and Rebates for Customer Orders 
Routed to Another Options Exchange’’ 
to ‘‘Fees for Customer Orders Routed to 
Another Options Exchange’’. The 
proposed change is intended to align the 
heading information of the Exchange’s 
Fee Schedule with the heading

conventions used for the fee schedules 
of the Exchange’s affiliates, MIAX,

proposed rule change is to promote 
consistency across the Exchange’s and 
its affiliates’ fee schedules. 
Implementation 
The proposed rule changes will 
become effective on December 1, 2025. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal to amend its Fee Schedule is 
consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act
9
 
in general, and furthers the objectives of 
Section 6(b)(4) of the Act
10
in 
particular, in that it is an equitable 
allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and 
other charges among its members and 
issuers and other persons using its 
facilities. The Exchange also believes 
the proposal furthers the objectives of 
Section 6(b)(5) of the Act
11
in that it is 
designed to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in 
general to protect investors and the 
public interest and is not designed to 
permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers and dealers. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed changes to the exchange 
groupings of options exchanges within 
the routing fee table furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(4) of the Act 
and is reasonable, equitable and not 
unfairly discriminatory because the 
proposed change will continue to apply 
in the same manner to all Members that 
are subject to routing fees. The 
Exchange believes the proposed changes 
to the routing fee table exchange 
groupings furthers the objectives of 
Section 6(b)(5) of the Act and is 
designed to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade and is not unfairly 
discriminatory because the proposed 
changes seek to recoup costs that are 
incurred by the Exchange when routing 
orders for Public Customers that are not 
Priority Customers to away markets on 
behalf of Members and does so in the 
same manner for all Members that are 
subject to routing fees. The costs to the 
Exchange to route orders to away 
markets for execution primarily 
includes transaction fees assessed by the 
away markets to which the Exchange 
routes orders, in addition to the 
Exchange’s clearing costs, 
administrative, regulatory and technical 
costs. The Exchange believes that the 
proposed re-categorization of certain 
exchange groupings would enable the 
Exchange to better reflect the costs and 
fees associated with routing orders to 
other exchanges for execution. 
The Exchange places away markets in 
the fee tier grouping that best 
approximates the Exchange’s costs and 
fees to route the orders in that segment 
to that away market. The per-contract 
transaction fee amount associated with 
each grouping approximates the 
Exchange’s all-in cost (plus an 
additional, non-material amount)
12
to 
execute the corresponding contract at 
the corresponding exchange. The 
Exchange believes its tier structure 
represents the best approach to reflect 
the costs and fees associated with 
routing and executing orders on other 
exchanges. As noted above, this routing 
fee structure is comparable to the 
structure in place on at least one other 
competing options exchange, Cboe BZX 
Options.
13
 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
change to the heading of Section 1)b) of 
the Fee Schedule furthers the objectives 
of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act and is 
designed to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade and remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system and, in 
general, protect investors and the public 
interest because the proposed rule 
change will provide greater clarity to 
Members and the public regarding the 
Exchange’s Fee Schedule by aligning the 
heading information of the Exchange’s 
Fee Schedule with the heading 
conventions used for the fee schedules 
of the Exchange’s affiliates. It is in the 
public interest for the Exchange’s Fee 
Schedule to be accurate and consistent. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed re-categorization of certain 
exchange groupings will impose any 
burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. The Exchange’s 
proposed re-categorization of certain 
exchange groupings is intended to 
enable the Exchange to recover the costs 
it incurs to route orders to away 
markets. The costs to the Exchange to 
route orders to away markets for 
execution primarily includes the 
transaction fees assessed by the away 
markets to which the Exchange routes 
orders, in addition to the Exchange’s 
clearing costs, administrative, regulatory 
and technical costs. The Exchange does 
not believe that this proposal imposes 
any unnecessary burden on competition 
because it seeks to better reflect the 
costs and fees incurred by the Exchange 
when routing orders to away markets on 
behalf of Members and notes that at 
least one other options exchange has a 
similar routing fee structure.
14
 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed change to the heading of 
Section 1)b) of the Fee Schedule will 
impose any burden on competition that 
is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
The proposed change is not intended to 
address competitive issues but rather is 
concerned solely with aligning the 
heading information of the Exchange’s 
Fee Schedule with the heading 
conventions used for the fee schedules 
of the Exchange’s affiliates. This is to 
promote consistency across the 
Exchange’s and its affiliates’ fee 
schedules.

Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
Written comments were neither 
solicited nor received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act,
15
and Rule 
19b–4(f)(2)
16
thereunder. At any time 
within 60 days of the filing of the 
proposed rule change, the Commission 
summarily may temporarily suspend 
such rule change if it appears to the 
Commission that such action is 
necessary or appropriate in the public 
interest, for the protection of investors, 
or otherwise in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. If the Commission 
takes such action, the Commission shall 
institute proceedings to determine 
whether the proposed rule should be 
approved or disapproved.

Nothing in this rule filing affects trades below 
$1.00 per share (‘‘subdollar trades’’). Any subdollar 
trade that adds displayed liquidity does not impact 
the rebate tier calculations and receives a rebate of 
0.15% of the total dollar value of the execution. See 
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 102086 
(January 2, 2025), 90 FR 1586 (January 8, 2025) (SR–

The Fee Schedule defines ‘‘ADV’’ as average 
daily volume calculated as the number of shares 
added or removed (as applicable) that execute at or 
above $1.00 per share, per day. ADV is calculated 
on a monthly basis.

Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
self-regulatory organization included 
statements concerning the purpose of 
and basis for the proposed rule change 
and discussed any comments it received 
on the proposed rule change. The text 
of these statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. 
The self-regulatory organization has

Sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant aspects of such statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to modify its 
Fee Schedule, pursuant to IEX Rule 
15.110(a) and (c), to modify the required 
criteria for one of its Displayed 
Liquidity Adding Rebate Tiers for 
executions priced at or above $1.00 to 
introduce an alternative means of 
qualifying for the rebate tier. IEX is not 
proposing to change the amounts of any 
rebates or fees. 
Displayed Liquidity Adding Rebate 
Tiers 
As reflected in the Transaction Fees 
section of the Fee Schedule, IEX 
currently offers Members the following 
seven Displayed Liquidity Adding 
Rebate tiers: 
€Tier 1: provides Member the Exchange’s base fee of FREE for all 
displayed liquidity adding executions 
priced at or above $1.00 per share 
(‘‘Added Displayed Liquidity’’)
9
if the 
Member adds less than 3,000,000 
ADV
10
of displayed liquidity in that 
month. 
€Tier 2: provides Member a rebate of $0.0010 per share for all Added 
Displayed Liquidity if the Member 
trades at least 5,000,000 non-displayed 
ADV and less than 10,000,000 non- 
displayed ADV. 
€Tier 3: provides Member a rebate of $0.0014 per share for all Added 
Displayed Liquidity if the Member: (1) 
adds at least 3,000,000 ADV of 
displayed liquidity and less than 
10,000,000 ADV of displayed liquidity; 
or (2) trades at least 10,000,000 non- 
displayed ADV; or (3) has an NBBO 
Time of at least 50% in at least 250 
ETPs. 
€Tier 4: provides Member a rebate of $0.0016 per share for all Added 
Displayed Liquidity if the Member: (1) 
adds at least 10,000,000 ADV of 
displayed liquidity and less than 
15,000,000 ADV of displayed liquidity; 
or (2) has an NBBO Time of at least 50% 
in at least 750 ETPs. 
€Tier 5: provides Member a rebate of $0.0018 per share for all Added 
Displayed Liquidity if the Member: (1) 
adds at least 15,000,000 ADV of 
displayed liquidity and less than 
20,000,000 ADV of displayed liquidity; 
or (2) trades at least 15,000,000 non-

displayed liquidity and less than 
30,000,000 ADV of displayed liquidity; 
or (2) trades at least 20,000,000 non- 
displayed ADV. 
€Tier 7: provides Member a rebate of $0.0022 per share for all Added 
Displayed Liquidity if the Member adds 
at least 30,000,000 ADV of displayed 
liquidity. 
IEX is proposing to modify the 
required criteria for qualifying for 
Displayed Liquidity Adding Rebate Tier 
7 (‘‘Tier 7’’) so that Members will have 
two ways in which they could qualify 
for Tier 7: (1) the current method, in 
which a Member qualifies for the rebate 
tier by adding at least 30,000,000 ADV 
of displayed liquidity; or (2) the 
proposed new method, in which a 
Member would qualify for the rebate tier 
by adding at least 25,000,000 ADV of 
displayed liquidity and trading at least 
30,000,000 non-displayed ADV. This 
proposed additional means of qualifying 
for Tier 7 requires a Member to both add 
a minimum amount of displayed 
liquidity and trade a minimum amount 
of non-displayed liquidity. Thus, the 
proposed change provides more 
opportunities for Members to qualify for 
Tier 7. 
Accordingly, IEX proposes to update 
its Fee Schedule to make two revisions 
to reflect the proposed changes to Tier 
7. First, the Exchange proposes to 
amend the Fee Schedule’s Base Rates 
table to update the description and fees 
associated with Base Fee Code ML 
(‘‘Add displayed liquidity’’). As 
amended, the Base Rates table will 
continue to list seven base rates for Fee 
Code ML, but the description of the base 
rate paid for a Member that adds at least 
30,000,000 ADV of displayed liquidity 
will state that a Member also can qualify 
for that base rate by adding at least 
25,000,000 ADV of displayed liquidity 
and trading at least 30,000,000 non- 
displayed ADV. Similarly, IEX proposes 
to update the description of Tier 7 in 
Footnote 4 to the Transaction Fees 
section. As proposed, Footnote 4 will be 
amended to reflect that a Member can 
qualify for Tier 7 either by adding at 
least 30,000,000 ADV of displayed 
liquidity, or by adding at least 
25,000,000 ADV of displayed liquidity 
and trading at least 30,000,000 non- 
displayed ADV. 
The proposed change to Tier 7 is 
designed to encourage Members that 
provide liquidity on the Exchange to 
maintain or increase their order flow, 
thereby contributing to a deeper and 
more liquid market to the benefit of all 
market participants and enhancing the 
attractiveness of the Exchange as a 
trading venue. IEX notes that this model 
of offering volume-based rebates is 
consistent with the rebates offered by 
competitor exchanges.
11
The Exchange 
also notes that the $0.0022 rebate for 
Tier 7, is well within the range of 
rebates offered by competing 
exchanges.
12
 
2. Statutory Basis 
IEX believes that the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the provisions 
of Section 6(b)
13
of the Act in general, 
and furthers the objectives of Sections 
6(b)(4)
14
of the Act, in particular, in that 
it is designed to provide for the 
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees and other charges among its 
Members and other persons using its 
facilities. The Exchange believes that 
the proposed fee change is reasonable, 
fair and equitable, and not designed to 
permit unfair discrimination. As 
discussed in the Purpose section, the 
Exchange has designed Tier 7 to allow 
Members an additional way to qualify 
for the Tier 7 incentive rebate. The 
Exchange notes that the proposed rebate 
is voluntary and not designed to permit 
unfair discrimination because it will be 
applied uniformly to all Members who 
satisfy the specified criteria. 
The Exchange operates in a highly 
competitive market in which market 
participants can readily direct order 
flow to competing venues if they deem 
fee levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive. IEX has concluded that, in 
the context of current regulatory 
requirements governing access fees and 
rebates, it is able to more effectively 
compete with other exchanges for order 
flow by offering Members an additional 
means of qualifying for higher rebate 
incentives. Based upon informal 
discussions with market participants, 
IEX believes that Members and other 
market participants may be more willing 
to send displayed orders to IEX if the 
proposed fee change is adopted. 
Accordingly, IEX has designed the 
proposed change to Tier 7 to allow 
Members an additional way to qualify 
for that particular incentive rebate tier. 
As discussed in the Purpose section, 
the Exchange believes that the proposed 
addition of new eligibility criteria for 
Tier 7 is reasonable and consistent with 
the Act because it is designed to 
incentivize Members to send additional 
displayed order flow to IEX as well as 
order flow seeking to trade with such 
displayed orders. Moreover, increases in 
displayed liquidity would contribute to 
the public price discovery process 
which would benefit all market 
participants and protect investors and 
the public interest. As noted in the 
Purpose section, other exchanges offer 
rebate tiers,
15
and thus the Exchange 
does not believe that this aspect of the 
proposal raises any new or novel issues 
not already considered by the 
Commission. 
As discussed above, the Exchange 
operates in a highly competitive market 
in which market participants can 
readily direct order flow to competing 
venues if they deem fee levels at a 
particular venue to be excessive. Within 
that context, the proposed additional 
criteria for qualifying for Tier 7 are 
designed to keep IEX’s displayed 
trading prices competitive with those of 
other exchanges. The proposed 
additional criteria for qualifying for Tier 
7 are comparable to the criteria applied 
by competing exchanges, and thus IEX 
does not believe that the proposal raises 
any new or novel issues not already 
considered by the Commission in the 
context of other exchanges’ fees.
16
 
Finally, to the extent this proposed 
fee change is successful in incentivizing 
the entry and execution of displayed 
orders on IEX, such greater liquidity 
will benefit all market participants by 
increasing price discovery and price 
formation as well as market quality and 
execution opportunities. And, as 
discussed above, IEX does not believe 
that any aspect of this proposal raises 
new or novel issues not already 
considered by the Commission. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
IEX does not believe that the 
proposed rule change will result in any 
burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
Exchange does not believe that the 
proposed rule change will impose any 
burden on intermarket competition that 
is not necessary or appropriate in

furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
The Exchange operates in a highly 
competitive market in which market 
participants can readily favor competing 
venues if fee schedules at other venues 
are viewed as more favorable. 
Consequently, the Exchange believes 
that the degree to which IEX fees could 
impose any burden on competition is 
extremely limited and does not believe 
that such fees would burden 
competition between Members or 
competing venues. Moreover, as noted 
in the Statutory Basis section, the 
Exchange does not believe that the 
proposed changes raise any new or 
novel issues not already considered by 
the Commission. 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on intramarket competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act 
because, while different rebates are 
assessed on Members, these rebate tiers 
are not based on the type of Member 
entering the orders that match, but 
rather on the Member’s own trading 
activity. Further, the proposed fee 
changes continue to be intended to 
encourage market participants to bring 
increased order flow to the Exchange, 
which benefits all market participants. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
Written comments were neither 
solicited nor received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii)
17
of the Act. 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
under Section 19(b)(2)(B)
18
of the Act to 
determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments

change is consistent with the Act.

FICC is proposing to revise the

Proposed Modification of the Clearing 
Fund Maintenance Fee 
The Maintenance Fee is designed to 
(i) diversify FICC’s revenue sources and 
mitigate its dependence on revenues 
driven by trading volumes, and (ii) add 
a stable revenue source that would 
contribute to FICC’s operating margin by 
offsetting increasing costs and expenses. 
The Maintenance Fee was implemented 
in 2016

and subsequently amended in 
2024.
7
Currently, the Maintenance Fee 
is calculated monthly, in arrears, as the 
product of (A) 0.085% and (B) the 
average of each Member’s Required 
Fund Deposit as of the end of each day, 
for the month, multiplied by the number 
of days in that month and divided by 
360. 
FICC operates a cost-plus pricing 
model. Accordingly, FICC’s fees are 
cost-based plus a markup. As part of 
FICC’s annual pricing review process 
and budgeting for 2026, FICC identified 
opportunities to better align fees and 
costs for FICC. Specifically, FICC is 
proposing a reduction in the 
Maintenance Fee percentage from 
0.085% to 0.075% for both GSD and 
MBSD. 
To effectuate the proposed fee change 
described above at GSD, FICC is 
proposing to change the Maintenance 
Fee percentage from ‘‘0.085%’’ to 
‘‘0.075%’’ in Section XIII (Clearing 
Fund Maintenance Fee) of the Fee 
Structure in the GSD Rules. Similarly, 
for MBSD, FICC is proposing to change 
the percentage referenced under the 
Clearing Fund Maintenance Fee from 
‘‘0.085%’’ to ‘‘0.075%’’ in Section I 
(Fees) of the Schedule of Charges Broker 
Account Group and Schedule of Charges 
Dealer Account Group, respectively, in 
the MBSD Rules. 
In addition, FICC is proposing 
changes to enhance the clarity of the 
Rules. Specifically, in Section XIII 
(Clearing Fund Maintenance Fee) of the 
Fee Structure in the GSD Rules as well 
as under the Clearing Fund 
Maintenance Fee in Section I (Fees) of 
the Schedule of Charges Broker Account 
Group and Schedule of Charges Dealer 
Account Group, respectively, in the 
MBSD Rules, FICC is proposing to 
remove the extraneous reference to ‘‘in 
the Clearing Fund’’ and replace ‘‘for’’ 
with ‘‘in’’ when referencing the number 
of days in a month. 
Proposed Removal of the Sponsored GC 
Pre-Payment Assessment 
FICC is proposing to eliminate the 
Sponsored GC Pre-Payment Assessment 
from the GSD Rules. The Sponsored GC 
Pre-Payment Assessment is a $250,000 
assessment that FICC collects from a 
Sponsoring Member at the time the 
Sponsoring Member onboards into the 
Sponsored GC Service.
8
Pursuant to the 
GSD Rules, FICC credits that amount 
back to the Sponsoring Member against 
its fees for use of the Sponsored GC 
Service until the earlier of (i) the 
assessment being completely depleted 
and (ii) thirty-six (36) months after the 
Sponsoring Member onboards into the 
Sponsored GC Service.
9
 
The Sponsored GC Pre-Payment 
Assessment was adopted in 2020, when 
FICC was developing the Sponsored GC 
Service, to ensure Sponsoring Members’ 
support of and readiness to participate 
in the Sponsored GC Service and justify 
FICC’s investment in building the new 
technology infrastructure that was 
necessary to implement the Sponsored 
GC Service.
10
Since that time, the 
Sponsored GC Service has been 
consistently used by Sponsoring 
Members, and FICC has recently 
proposed expansions to the Sponsored 
GC Service.
11
Therefore, FICC no longer 
believes the Sponsored GC Pre-Payment 
Assessment is necessary and is 
proposing to eliminate the assessment 
from the GSD Rules to further encourage 
the use of the expanded Sponsored GC 
service by Sponsoring Members. 
The proposed change would remove 
the definition of the Sponsored GC Pre- 
Payment Assessment from Rule 1 and 
would remove the description of the 
Sponsored GC Pre-Payment Assessment 
from Section VII of the GSD Fee 
Structure, which describes the 
responsibilities of Sponsoring Members 
to pay fees in connection with the 
Sponsored Service. 
Proposed Adoption of Clearing Agent 
Bank Pass-Through Fees 
FICC is proposing to include in the 
GSD Fee Structure new pass-through 
fees that would be charged by Bank of 
New York (‘‘BNY’’), as a Clearing Agent 
Bank, and passed to Members by FICC. 
The additional pass-through fees 
would include a new fee to be referred 
to as a ‘‘Core Services Fee’’ of 0.15 basis 
points calculated on the settlement 
amount of the Start Leg of all Sponsored 
GC Trades (including trades that would 
be cleared through the proposed CIL 
Service, to be referred to as Sponsored 
GC CIL Trades)
12
and triparty trades 
that would be cleared through the Agent 
Clearing Service, to be referred to as 
‘‘ACS Triparty Trades.’’
13
The 
additional pass-through fees would also 
include a fee to be referred to as the 
‘‘Enhanced Services Fee’’ of 0.35 basis 
points calculated on the settlement 
amount of the Start Leg of all Sponsored 
GC CIL Trades. The Enhanced Services 
Fee would be charged on Sponsored GC 
CIL Trades in addition to the Core 
Services Fee. Both of the new pass- 
through fees would be assessed to the 
Repo Party to the transactions. 
The GSD Fee Structure currently 
identifies fees that are charged by BNY 
in connection with existing global 
collateral services and are passed 
through to Members of FICC. These fees 
are collected in connection with 
clearing GCF Repo Transactions and 
CCLF Transactions. In connection with 
adding the new BNY pass-through fees 
to the GSD Fee Structure, the proposed 
changes would also include these 
existing pass-through fees with the Core 
Services Fees and would simplify the 
description of the calculation and 
assessment of these fees. The proposed 
changes are designed to help Members 
better understand the fees that FICC 
currently passes from BNY in 
connection with their use of these global 
collateral services. 
Therefore, the proposed changes 
would amend Section IV (Other 
Charges) of the GSD Fee Structure, 
where ‘‘Clearance Charges,’’ including 
those that are passed through from 
Clearing Agent Banks, are described. 
The proposed changes would create a 
new subsection B.4.(c) to identify fees

that may be charged by any Clearing 
Agent Bank on the global collateral 
services offered by FICC. This proposed 
change would allow FICC to identify 
any fees that may be charged by another 
Clearing Agent Bank in the future and 
would similarly be passed through to 
Members by FICC in this proposed new 
subsection. 
A new subsection B.4.(c)(i) would 
then specifically identify the fees that 
are currently, and would be, charged by 
BNY. These fees would be identified as 
either ‘‘Core Services Fees’’ or 
‘‘Enhanced Services Fees,’’ as described 
above. 
The proposed changes would not 
change the existing pass-through fees 
that are charged by BNY on GCF Repo 
Transactions and CCIT Transactions. 
The existing description of these fees 
(currently described in subsection 
B.4.(c) of the GSD Fee Schedule) would 
be replaced with clearer, simplified 
descriptions in the new subsection 
B.4.(c)(i) and would identify these fees 
as Bank of New York Core Services 
Fees. 
Expected Member Impact of Proposed 
Rule Changes 
FICC projects that all Members would 
see an approximately 12% fee reduction 
as a result of the proposed change to the 
Maintenance Fee. The proposed 
removal of the Sponsored GC Pre- 
Payment Assessment would not have an 
impact on Sponsoring Members who 
use the Sponsored GC Service because 
the current application of this fee results 
in the return of the full amount to those 
Members through a credit against its 
fees for use of the Sponsored GC 
Service, as described above. FICC is not 
able to assess the potential impact of the 
proposed new pass-through fees, which 
would be assessed by BNY as a Clearing 
Agent Bank, based on participants’ use 
of the existing and proposed global 
collateral services. 
Member Outreach Regarding Proposed 
Rule Changes 
FICC has conducted ongoing outreach 
to Members to provide them with notice 
of the proposed change to the 
Maintenance Fee and the anticipated 
impact for the Member. FICC has not 
conducted outreach regarding the 
elimination of the Sponsored GC Pre- 
Payment Assessment. FICC has also not 
conducted outreach regarding the pass- 
through fees that would be charged by 
the Clearing Agent Bank, as such 
outreach would be conducted by BNY. 
As of the date of this filing, no written 
comments relating to the proposed 
changes have been received in response 
to this outreach. The Commission will 
be notified of any written comments 
received. 
Implementation Timeframe 
FICC would implement the proposed 
changes to modify the Maintenance Fee 
on January 1, 2026. As proposed, a 
legend would be added to the Rules 
stating the change to the Maintenance 
Fee would become effective upon filing 
with the Commission but has not yet 
been implemented. The proposed 
legend would also include the date on 
which such change would be 
implemented and the file number of this 
proposal, and state that, once that 
change is implemented, the legend 
would automatically be removed. 
FICC would implement the proposed 
change to remove the Sponsored GC 
Pre-Payment Assessment upon filing, 
pursuant to paragraph A of Section 
19(b)(3) of the Act
14
and Sponsoring 
Members who elect to use the 
Sponsored GC Service on and after that 
date would not be required to make a 
Sponsored GC Pre-Payment Assessment. 
Sponsoring Members that have already 
been assessed a Sponsored GC Pre- 
Payment Assessment prior to that date 
would continue to receive a credit 
against fees for their use of the 
Sponsored GC Service until such time 
currently set forth in the GSD Rules. As 
proposed, a footnote would be added to 
the GSD Rules stating that a Sponsored 
GC Pre-Payment Assessment would no 
longer be collected from Sponsoring 
Members who elect to use the 
Sponsored GC Service and that the 
related Rules would only apply to 
Sponsoring Members who have already 
made a Sponsored GC Pre-Payment 
Assessment. The footnote and the Rules 
related to the Sponsored GC Pre- 
Payment Assessment would 
automatically be removed from the GSD 
Rules when all such assessments have 
been completely depleted or thirty-six 
(36) months after the last Sponsoring 
Member who made a Sponsored GC Pre- 
Payment Assessment onboarded to the 
Sponsored GC Service, whichever is 
earlier. 
FICC would implement the proposed 
change to adopt changes to the GSD Fee 
Schedule to assist Members to better 
understand the pass-through fees upon 
filing, pursuant to paragraph A of 
Section 19(b)(3) of the Act.
15
As 
proposed, footnotes would be added to 
the GSD Rules to reflect that the fees 
that would be applicable to Sponsored 
GC Trades would become effective on 
January 1, 2026, fees that would be 
applicable to Sponsored GC CIL Trades 
would become effective on the date 
FICC implements the changes to the 
GSD Rules that are proposed by the CIL 
Filing, and the fees that would be 
applied to ACS Triparty Trades would 
become effective on the date FICC 
implements the changes that are 
proposed by the ACS Triparty Filing. 
2. Statutory Basis 
FICC believes this proposal is 
consistent with the requirements of the 
Act, and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to a registered 
clearing agency. Specifically, FICC 
believes the proposed changes are 
consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of 
the Act
16
and Rule 17ad–22(e)(23)(ii)
17
 
thereunder, for the reasons described 
below. 
Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act 
requires that the rules of a clearing 
agency, such as FICC, provide for the 
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees, and other charges among its 
participants.
18
FICC believes that the 
proposed changes are consistent with 
this provision of the Act for the reasons 
described below. 
FICC believes the Maintenance Fee 
would continue to be equitably 
allocated. More specifically, as 
described above, the Maintenance Fee 
would be charged to all Members in 
proportion to the Members’ Required 
Fund Deposits. As such, and as is 
currently the case, Members that present 
greater risk to FICC would generally be 
subject to a larger Maintenance Fee 
because such Member would typically 
be required to maintain a higher 
Required Fund Deposit pursuant to the 
respective GSD Rules and MBSD 
Rules.
19
Conversely, Members that 
present less risk to FICC would 
generally be subject to a smaller 
Maintenance Fee because such Members 
would typically be required to maintain 
a smaller Required Fund Deposit 
pursuant to the respective GSD Rules 
and MBSD Rules.
20
For this reason, 
FICC believes the Maintenance Fee 
would continue to be equitably 
allocated among Members. 
The proposal to remove the 
Sponsored GC Pre-Payment Assessment 
would revise the fee structure of the 
Sponsored GC Service by removing a 
requirement to pre-pay a certain 
amount, which is then credited against 
fees for the use of the service. Following 
the proposed change, FICC would

instead only charge Sponsoring 
Members fees for their use of the service 
at the time of such use. This proposed 
change would continue to apply the fee 
structure for the Sponsored GC Service 
to all Sponsoring Members equally and 
would provide for an equitable 
allocation of reasonable fees that align 
to use of the associated service. 
Finally, the proposal to pass through 
the fees charged by the Clearing Agent 
Bank on the use of FICC’s global 
collateral services would apply the same 
basis point charge on the settlement 
amount of the Start Leg of trades cleared 
through such services to all Members 
who use such services. FICC would pass 
through these fees to its Members at the 
same rate that would be charged to it by 
BNY, as the Clearing Agent Bank. As 
such, these pass-through fees would be 
allocated equitably to Members. 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(23)(ii) under the Act 
requires FICC to establish, implement, 
maintain and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to 
provide sufficient information to enable 
participants to identify and evaluate the 
risks, fees, and other material costs they 
incur by participating in the covered 
clearing agency. The proposed changes, 
if approved, would be clearly and 
transparently published in Section XIII 
(Clearing Fund Maintenance Fee) of the 
Fee Structure in the GSD Rules and 
Section I (Fees) of the Schedule of 
Charges Broker Account Group as well 
as Schedule of Charges Dealer Account 
Group in the MBSD Rules, all of which 
are available on a public website,
21
 
thereby enabling Members to identify 
the fees and costs associated with 
participating in FICC. As such, FICC 
believes the proposed rule changes are 
consistent with Rule 17ad–22(e)(23)(ii) 
under the Act.
22
 
(B) Clearing Agency’s Statement on 
Burden on Competition 
FICC believes that, although Members 
may experience some impact from the 
proposed rule change to modify the GSD 
and MBSD Maintenance Fees and adopt 
new pass-through fees from BNY, the 
proposed rule change would not impose 
a burden on competition among its 
Members that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act.
23
As described 
above, the Maintenance Fee is charged 
ratably based on the risk that each 
Member brings to FICC, as reflected in 
Members’ Required Fund Deposits. 
Thus, the Maintenance Fee is designed 
to be reflective of each Member’s 
individual activity submitted for 
clearing and settlement at FICC and the 
associated risk exposure to FICC. 
Likewise, the proposal to adopt 
additional pass-through fees that would 
be charged by the Clearing Agent Bank 
would be applied equally to all 
Members who use FICC’s global 
collateral services. 
FICC does not believe the proposal to 
remove the Sponsored GC Pre-Payment 
Assessment would have any impact on 
competition as it would revise the cost 
structure for the use of the Sponsored 
GC Service for all Sponsoring Members 
who elect to use the service. 
FICC also does not believe the 
proposed clarifying change to the Rules 
would have any impact on competition. 
These proposed changes would enhance 
the Rules by providing additional 
clarity. The proposed clarifying changes 
would not advantage or disadvantage 
any particular Member at GSD and 
MBSD or unfairly inhibit access to 
FICC’s services. FICC therefore does not 
believe the proposed clarifying changes 
would have any impact, or impose any 
burden, on competition.
24

Proposed Rule Change Relating to the 
ICC Stress Testing Framework and the 
ICC Liquidity Risk Management 
Framework 
December 15, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934
1
and 
Rule 19b–4,
2
notice is hereby given that 
on December 1, 2025, ICE Clear Credit 
LLC (‘‘ICC’’ or ‘‘ICE Clear Credit’’) filed 
with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission the proposed rule change 
as described in Items I, II and III below, 
which Items have been primarily 
prepared by ICC. The Commission is 
publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change 
from interested persons. 
I. Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Terms of Substance of the Proposed 
Rule Change 
The principal purpose of the 
proposed rule change is to revise the 
ICC Stress Testing Framework (‘‘STF’’) 
and ICC Liquidity Risk Management 
Framework (‘‘LRMF’’). These revisions 
do not require any changes to the ICC 
Clearing Rules.
3
 
II. Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the 
Proposed Rule Change 
In its filing with the Commission, ICC 
included statements concerning the 
purpose of and basis for the proposed 
rule change, security-based swap 
submission, or advance notice and 
discussed any comments it received on 
the proposed rule change, security- 
based swap submission, or advance 
notice. The text of these statements may 
be examined at the places specified in 
Item IV below. ICC has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), 
and (C) below, of the most significant 
aspects of these statements. 
(A) Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the 
Proposed Rule Change 
(a) Purpose 
ICC proposes revising its STF and 
LRMF to introduce new stress scenarios 
that reflect a period of recent market 
turmoil related to the enactment of new 
U.S. tariffs (the ‘‘U.S. Tariffs Crisis 
Scenarios’’). ICC also proposes 
additional updates to reflect current 
governance practices and make minor 
clean-up changes in the STF and LRMF. 
ICC believes that such revisions will 
facilitate the prompt and accurate 
clearance and settlement of securities 
transactions and derivative agreements, 
contracts, and transactions for which it 
is responsible. ICC proposes to move 
forward with implementation of such 
changes following Commission approval 
of the proposed rule change. The 
proposed revisions are described in 
detail as follows. 
I. Stress Scenario Changes 
ICC proposes to introduce the U.S. 
Tariffs Crisis Scenarios in the STF. The 
STF sets out ICC’s stress test 
methodology, including the stress 
scenarios used in ICC’s risk 
management process. The ICC Risk 
Department maintains predefined stress 
scenarios which are divided into the 
following four categories: (1) 
Historically Observed Extreme but 
Plausible Market Scenarios,
4
(2) 
Historically Observed Extreme but 
Plausible Market Scenarios: Severity of 
Losses in Response to Baseline Market 
Events,
5
(3) Hypothetically Constructed 
(Forward Looking) Extreme but 
Plausible Market Scenarios,
6
and (4) 
Extreme Model Response Tests.
7
 
ICC proposes to amend Section 5.1 of 
the STF, which lists the Historically 
Observed Extreme but Plausible Market 
Scenarios, to add the proposed U.S. 
Tariffs Crisis Scenarios. As described in 
amended Section 5.1, the proposed 
scenarios consist of widening and 
tightening scenarios and are based on 
observed relative spread increases and 
decreases during the second quarter of 
2025. Additional description is 
proposed to explain how the scenarios 
are constructed in terms of spread 
changes and end-of-day spread levels. 
ICC proposes changes to Section 5.3 
of the STF, which sets out the 
Hypothetically Constructed (Forward 
Looking) Extreme but Plausible Market 
Scenarios to incorporate the proposed 
U.S. Tariffs Crisis Scenarios. The 
Hypothetically Constructed (Forward 
Looking) Extreme but Plausible Market 
Scenarios are based on Historically 
Observed Extreme but Plausible Market 
Scenarios augmented with adverse 
credit events and an additional loss 
scenario, as set out in the STF. ICC 
proposes to include the U.S. Tariffs 
Crisis Scenarios augmented with 
adverse credit events and an additional 
loss scenario in the bulleted list of 
Hypothetically Constructed (Forward 
Looking) Extreme but Plausible Market 
Scenarios. 
ICC proposes additional changes to 
Section 5.4 of the STF, which sets out 
the Extreme Model Response Test 
Scenarios. Such scenarios are derived 
from Historically Observed Extreme but 
Plausible Market Scenarios by 
increasing the magnitudes for the 
widening and tightening spread 
scenarios. ICC proposes to include the 
U.S. Tariffs Crisis Scenarios in the 
bulleted list of Extreme Model Response 
Test Scenarios. 
ICC proposes a conforming change to 
add the U.S. Tariffs Crisis Scenarios to 
a list of Historically Observed and 
Hypothetically Constructed Extreme but 
Plausible Scenarios in Section 14 of the 
STF. Such list describes ICC’s reporting 
obligations. 
The proposed amendments to the 
LRMF incorporate the U.S. Tariffs Crisis 
Scenarios to ensure unification of the 
LRMF and STF as ICC operates stress 
testing and liquidity stress testing on a 
unified set of stress testing scenarios. 
Section 3.3.2 of the LRMF sets out the 
four abovementioned categories of 
predefined scenarios that are 
maintained by the ICC Risk Department. 
ICC proposes to incorporate 
descriptions of the U.S. Tariffs Crisis 
Scenarios in Section 3.3.2(a), which 
contains the Historically Observed 
Extreme but Plausible Market Scenarios. 
Like the changes discussed above, the 
proposed scenarios consist of widening 
and tightening scenarios and are based 
on observed relative spread increases

ICC previously filed a proposed rule change to 
establish the Board Risk Committee. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 103161 (May 30, 2025),

and decreases during the second quarter 
of 2025. Additional language is 
proposed to explain how the scenarios 
are constructed in terms of spread 
changes, analogues, and end-of-day 
spread levels. 
ICC proposes updates to memorialize 
the proposed scenarios as part of its 
liquidity stress testing and reporting 
obligations. Specifically, ICC proposes 
to include the proposed scenarios in 
Table 1 of Section 3.3.3 of the LRMF, 
which sets out ICC’s liquidity stress 
testing scenarios. ICC also proposes to 
add the U.S. Tariffs Crisis Scenarios to 
a list of Historically Observed and 
Hypothetically Constructed Extreme but 
Plausible Scenarios in Section 3.3.4 of 
the LRMF. Such list describes ICC’s 
reporting obligations. 
II. Governance Updates and Clean-Ups 
ICC proposes changes to the 
documentation to add reference to the 
recently established Board Risk 
Committee to reflect current governance 
practices and make other minor clean- 
up changes.
8
Namely, ICC proposes 
edits to Sections 14 and 15 of the STF 
to incorporate references to the Board 
Risk Committee. In Section 14, the 
proposed changes note the items that 
are discussed with the Board Risk 
Committee (e.g., risk methodology enhancements and development) as 
well as the level of reporting and 
communication that is provided to the 
Board Risk Committee with respect to 
stress test results and stress test 
deficiencies. In Section 15, the proposed 
changes specify a timely process for 
communicating stress test results and 
associated recommendations to the 
Board Risk Committee and discuss the 
necessity of obtaining recommendations 
(for example, related to retiring or 
modifying outdated scenarios or 
portfolios or adding new scenarios or 
portfolios) from the Board Risk 
Committee. Section 15 would also 
specify that the STF is subject to Board 
Risk Committee review at least 
annually, in addition to review by the 
Risk Committee and review and 
approval by the Board at least annually. 
A conforming change is also proposed 
to Section 4.3 of the LRMF to 
memorialize the document’s review at 
least annually by the Board Risk 
Committee. 
ICC proposes additional changes to 
update governance practices in the 
LRMF. Amended Section 1.3 of the 
LRMF states that the Board Risk 
Committee is involved in the 
governance process for the reporting of 
liquidity adequacy analysis results, 
along with ICC senior management, the 
Risk Committee, and the Board. ICC 
proposes minor clean-up changes to 
move Figure 1, which contains an 
overview of the LRMF, to follow a 
narrative description of the LRMF in 
Section 1.4 to promote understanding 
and readability of key LRMF elements, 
namely, liquidity risk management 
model, measurement and monitoring, 
and governance. No changes are 
proposed to Figure 1. In Sections 3.3.4, 
4.2, and 4.3 of the LRMF, the proposed 
changes note the items that are 
discussed with the Board Risk 
Committee (e.g., liquidity risk management methodology and model 
enhancements and development) as 
well as the level of reporting and 
communication with respect to stress 
test results, liquidity stress test 
deficiency, and liquidity adequacy 
analysis that is provided to the Board 
Risk Committee. 
(b) Statutory Basis 
ICC believes that the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the 
requirements of Section 17A of the Act
9
 
and the regulations thereunder 
applicable to it, including the applicable 
standards under Rule 17Ad–22.
10
In 
particular, Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the 
Act
11
requires that the rule change be 
designed to promote the prompt and 
accurate clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions and derivative 
agreements, contracts and transactions 
cleared by ICC, to assure the 
safeguarding of securities and funds in 
the custody or control of ICC or for 
which it is responsible, and to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
As discussed herein, the proposed 
rule change would revise the STF and 
LRMF to introduce the U.S. Tariffs 
Crisis Scenarios. ICC also proposes 
additional updates to reflect current 
governance practices and make minor 
clean-up changes in the documentation. 
The proposed revisions strengthen the 
STF and LRMF through the introduction 
of the U.S. Tariffs Crisis Scenarios, 
which would complement the current 
scenarios and add additional insight 
into potential weaknesses in the ICC 
risk management methodology. ICC also 
proposes making additional minor 
updates to reflect current governance 
practices in the STF and LRMF. Such 
changes ensure that the documentation 
remains up-to-date, clear and 
transparent to support the effectiveness 
of ICC’s governance arrangements that 
support ICC’s stress testing and liquidity 
risk management practices. Such 
changes, as well as the proposed clean- 
ups moving Figure 1, promote 
understanding and readability of the 
LRMF, including with respect to ICC’s 
stress testing and liquidity risk 
management practices. ICC believes that 
having policies and procedures that 
clearly and accurately document its 
stress testing and liquidity risk 
management practices are an important 
component to the effectiveness of ICC’s 
risk management system and support 
ICC’s ability to maintain adequate 
financial resources, which promotes the 
prompt and accurate clearance and 
settlement of securities transactions, 
derivatives agreements, contracts, and 
transactions, the safeguarding of 
securities and funds in the custody or 
control of ICC or for which it is 
responsible, and the protection of 
investors and the public interest. 
Accordingly, in ICC’s view, the 
proposed rule change is designed to 
promote the prompt and accurate 
clearance and settlement of the 
contracts cleared at ICC, to assure the 
safeguarding of securities and funds in 
the custody or control of ICC or for 
which it is responsible, and to protect 
investors and the public interest, within 
the meaning of Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of 
the Act.
12
 
The amendments would also satisfy 
relevant requirements of Rule 17Ad– 
22.
13
Rule 17Ad–22(e)(2)(i) and (v)
14
 
requires each covered clearing agency to 
establish, implement, maintain, and 
enforce written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to provide for 
governance arrangements that are clear 
and transparent and specify clear and 
direct lines of responsibility. As 
discussed above, the proposed changes 
reflect current ICC governance 
arrangements in the STF and LRMF. 
Specifically, ICC proposes adding 
references to the recently established 
Board Risk Committee. Such changes 
ensure that the STF and LRMF are up- 
to-date and clearly assign and document 
responsibility and accountability for 
relevant items to the Board Risk 
Committee. As such, in ICC’s view, the 
proposed rule change continues to 
ensure that ICC maintains policies and 
procedures that are reasonably designed 
to provide for clear and transparent 
governance arrangements and specify 
clear and direct lines of responsibility,

requires ICC 
to establish, implement, maintain and 
enforce written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to maintain a 
sound risk management framework for 
comprehensively managing legal, credit, 
liquidity, operational, general business, 
investment, custody, and other risks 
that arise in or are borne by it, which 
includes risk management policies, 
procedures, and systems designed to 
identify, measure, monitor, and manage 
the range of risks that arise in or are 
borne by it, that are subject to review on 
a specified periodic basis and approved 
by the Board annually. The proposed 
updates would ensure further clarity 
and transparency in the STF and LRMF 
by making minor clean-up changes to 
the documentation and regarding the 
review of the documents composing 
ICC’s risk management framework 
(including the STF and LRMF) by the 
Board Risk Committee, which would 
promote the successful maintenance 
and operation of ICC’s risk management 
framework. As such, the amendments 
would satisfy the requirements of Rule 
17Ad–22(e)(3)(i).
17
 
Rule 17Ad–22(e)(4)(ii)
18
requires ICC 
to establish, implement, maintain, and 
enforce written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to effectively 
identify, measure, monitor, and manage 
its credit exposures to participants and 
those arising from its payment, clearing, 
and settlement processes, including by 
maintaining additional financial 
resources at the minimum to enable it 
to cover a wide range of foreseeable 
stress scenarios that include, but are not 
limited to, the default of the two 
participant families that would 
potentially cause the largest aggregate 
credit exposure for ICC in extreme but 
plausible market conditions. The 
introduction of the proposed U.S. 
Tariffs Crisis Scenarios would 
complement the current scenarios in the 
documentation and add additional 
insight into potential weaknesses in the 
ICC risk management methodology, 
thereby supporting ICC’s ability to 
manage its financial resources. 
Additional revisions memorialize 
current governance arrangements in the 
STF, which provides further clarity and 
transparency regarding ICC’s stress 
testing practices, thereby strengthening 
the documentation related to ICC’ stress 
testing methodology. As such, the 
proposed amendments would 
strengthen ICC’s ability to maintain its 
financial resources and withstand the 
pressures of defaults, consistent with 
the requirements of Rule 17Ad– 
22(e)(4)(ii).
19
 
Rule 17Ad–22(e)(7)(i)
20
requires each 
covered clearing agency to establish, 
implement, maintain, and enforce 
written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to effectively 
measure, monitor, and manage the 
liquidity risk that arises in or is borne 
by the covered clearing agency, 
including measuring, monitoring, and 
managing its settlement and funding 
flows on an ongoing and timely basis, 
and its use of intraday liquidity by 
maintaining sufficient liquid resources 
at the minimum in all relevant 
currencies to effect same-day and, 
where appropriate, intraday and 
multiday settlement of payment 
obligations with a high degree of 
confidence under a wide range of 
foreseeable stress scenarios that 
includes, but is not limited to, the 
default of the participant family that 
would generate the largest aggregate 
payment obligation for the covered 
clearing agency in extreme but plausible 
market conditions. As noted above, the 
introduction of the proposed U.S. 
Tariffs Crisis Scenarios would 
complement the current scenarios in the 
documentation and add additional 
insight into potential weaknesses in the 
ICC liquidity risk management 
methodology, thereby supporting ICC’s 
ability to ensure that it maintains 
sufficient liquidity resources. 
Additional revisions to the LRMF 
provide further clarity and transparency 
regarding ICC’s liquidity stress testing 
practices to strengthen the 
documentation surrounding ICC’s 
liquidity stress testing methodology, 
including by memorializing current 
governance arrangements and ensuring 
uniformity with the STF. As such, the 
proposed amendments would promote 
ICC’s ability to ensure that it maintains 
sufficient liquid resources in accordance 
with the requirements of Rule 17Ad– 
22(e)(7)(i).
21
 
(B) Clearing Agency’s Statement on 
Burden on Competition 
ICC does not believe the proposed 
rule change would have any impact, or 
impose any burden, on competition. 
The proposed changes to ICC’s STF and 
LRMF will apply uniformly across all 
market participants. ICC does not 
believe these amendments would affect 
the costs of clearing or the ability of 
market participants to access clearing. 
Therefore, ICC does not believe the 
proposed rule change imposes any 
burden on competition that is 
inappropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. 
(C) Clearing Agency’s Statement on 
Comments on the Proposed Rule 
Change Received From Members, 
Participants or Others 
Written comments relating to the 
proposed rule change have not been 
solicited or received. ICC will notify the 
Commission of any written comments 
received by ICC. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

publication of this notice in the Federal 
Register or within such longer period up to 90 days (i) as the Commission may 
designate if it finds such longer period

Currently, the ORF is assessed by EDGX Options 
and collected via OCC on executions for the 
account of Public Customers, including 
Professionals, and Broker-Dealers including Foreign 
Broker-Dealers. These market participants clear in 
the ‘‘C’’ range at OCC. ORF will continue to be 
assessed to executions for the account of these 
market participants under the proposed 
methodology. On the Exchange, a ‘‘Public 
Customer’’ means a person that is not a broker or 
dealer in securities and includes both Priority 
Customers and Professionals. A ‘‘Priority 
Customer’’ means a person or entity that is a Public 
Customer and is not a Professional. A 
‘‘Professional’’ is any person or entity that (a) is not 
a broker or dealer in securities, and (b) places more 
than 390 orders in listed options per day on average 
during a calendar month for its own beneficial 
account(s). Executions for the account of an OCC 
clearing member firm proprietary account, joint 
back office account clearing in the Firm range, or 
account of a market maker clearing in the Market 
Maker range are not charged an ORF, nor would 
they be charged an ORF under the current proposal.

and Immediate Effectiveness of a 
Proposed Rule Change To Adopt a 
New Methodology for Assessment and 
Collection of the Options Regulatory 
Fee (ORF) 
December 15, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
2, 2025, Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. (the 
‘‘Exchange’’ or ‘‘EDGX’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
Fees Schedule relating to the Options 
Regulatory Fee (‘‘ORF’’) to adopt a new 
methodology for assessment and 
collection of ORF for transactions that 
occur on the Exchange (‘‘On-Exchange 
ORF’’), effective as of July 1, 2026. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Commission’s 
website (https://www.sec.gov/rules/ 
sro.shtml), the Exchange’s website 
(https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/ 
regulation/rule_filings/bzx/), and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
current methodology for assessment and 
collection of a regulatory fee to assess 
On-Exchange ORF only for options 
transactions that occur on the Exchange 
that would clear in the customer
3
range 
at The Options Clearing Corporation 
(‘‘OCC’’). The Exchange would no 
longer assess a regulatory fee for options 
transactions that occur on other 
exchanges. This proposal only proposes 
to amend the method of assessment and 
collection of the fee. A future rule filing 
would be filed to set the applicable On- 
Exchange ORF rate. If the On-Exchange 
ORF model were to go into effect today, 
the current ORF rate would increase 
from $0.0001 per contract to an 
estimated On-Exchange ORF rate of 
$0.00274 per contract based on 2026 
estimates of regulatory revenue, 
regulatory costs, and customer volume.
4
 
The following provides more detail 
regarding the proposal. 
Background 
Today, ORF is assessed by EDGX 
Options to each Member for options 
transactions that are cleared by the 
Member (‘‘Clearing Member’’) at OCC in 
the Customer range, regardless of the 
exchange on which the transaction 
occurs. In other words, the Exchange 
imposes the ORF on all Customer-range 
transactions cleared by a Member, even 
if the transactions do not take place on 
the Exchange. The ORF is collected by 
OCC on behalf of the Exchange from the 
Clearing Member or non-Member that 
ultimately clears the transaction as 
further described below. With respect to 
linkage transactions, EDGX Options 
reimburses its routing broker providing 
Routing Services pursuant to EDGX 
Options Rule 21.9 for options regulatory 
fees it incurs in connection with the 
Routing Services it provides. The 
current EDGX Options ORF is $0.0001 
per contract side. 
The following scenarios reflect how 
the ORF is currently assessed and 
collected (these apply regardless of 
whether the transaction is executed on 
the Exchange or on an away exchange): 
1. If a Member is the executing 
clearing firm on a transaction 
(‘‘Executing Clearing Firm’’), the ORF is 
assessed to and collected from that 
Member by OCC on behalf of the 
Exchange. 
2. If a Member is the Executing 
Clearing Firm and the transaction is 
‘‘given up’’ to a different Member that 
clears the transaction (‘‘Clearing Give- 
Up’’), the ORF is assessed to the 
Executing Clearing Firm (the ORF is the 
obligation of the Executing Clearing 
Firm). The ORF is collected from the 
Clearing Give-Up. 
3. If the Executing Clearing Firm is a 
non-Member and the Clearing Give-up 
is a Member, the ORF is assessed to and 
collected from the Clearing Give-up. 
4. If a Member is the Executing 
Clearing Firm and a non-Member is the 
Clearing Give-up, the ORF is assessed to 
the Executing Clearing Firm. The ORF is 
the obligation of the Executing Clearing 
Firm but is collected from the non- 
Member Clearing Give-up (for the 
reasons described below). 
5. No ORF is assessed if neither the 
Executing Clearing Firm nor the 
Clearing Give-up are Members.

The Exchange notes that in the case where a 
non-self clearing Member executes a transaction on 
the Exchange, the Member’s guaranteeing Clearing 
Member is reflected as the Executing Clearing Firm 
in the OCC cleared trades file and the ORF is 
assessed to and collected from the Executing 
Clearing Firm. 
6
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 83880 (August 17, 2018), 83 FR 42719 (August 23, 2018) 
(SR–CboeEDGX–2018–033). 
7
The Exchange notes that OCC provides the 
Exchange and other exchanges with information to 
assist in excluding CMTA transfers done to correct 
bona fide errors from the ORF calculation. 
Specifically, if a clearing firm gives up or CMTA 
transfers a position to the wrong clearing firm, the 
firm that caused the error will send an offsetting 
CMTA transfer to that firm and send a new CMTA 
transfer to the correct firm. The offsetting CMTA 
transfer is marked with a CMTA Transfer ORF 
Indicator which results in the original erroneous 
transfer being excluded from the ORF calculation. 
8
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 58817 (October 20, 2008), 73 FR 63744 (October 27, 2008) 
(SR–CBOE–2008–105). 
9
These expectations are estimated and may be 
subject to change. 
10
See supra note 3. 
11
Under the current methodology for assessing 
ORF, the Exchange on which the transaction 
occurred is irrelevant. 
12
The Exchange originally planned to exclude all 
CMTAs whether reported to the Exchange or 
directly to the OCC. If CMTAs are excluded, the 
Exchange would only collect ORF from its Members 
and ORF would no longer be collected from non- 
Members. The Exchange continues to believe that 
a new ORF model should be assessed to Members 
only, but also understands the desire for a uniform 
approach to the assessment and collection of ORF 
across all options exchanges. As of filing, 6 
The Exchange uses an OCC cleared 
trades file to determine the Executing 
Clearing Firm and the Clearing Give- 
up.
5
 
In each of scenarios 1 through 4 
above, if the transaction is transferred 
pursuant to a Clearing Member Trade 
Assignment (‘‘CMTA’’) agreement to 
another clearing firm who ultimately 
clears the transaction, the ORF is 
collected from the clearing firm that 
ultimately clears the transaction (which 
firm may be a non-Member) by OCC on 
behalf of the Exchange. Using CMTA 
transfer information provided by the 
OCC, the Exchange subtracts the ORF 
charge from the monthly ORF bill of the 
clearing firm that transfers the position 
and adds the charge to the monthly ORF 
bill of the clearing firm that receives the 
CMTA transfer (i.e., the ultimate clearing firm).
6
This process is 
performed at the end of each month on 
each transfer in the OCC CMTA transfer 
file for that month.
7
 
ORF is collected by OCC on behalf of 
the Exchange from the Member or non- 
Member OCC Clearing Member that 
ultimately clears the transaction. While 
the ORF is an obligation of the 
Executing Clearing Firm, the ORF is 
collected from the clearing firm that 
ultimately clears the eligible trade, even 
if such firm is not a Member. The 
Exchange and OCC adopted this 
collection method in response to 
industry feedback that it would allow 
Members and non-Members to more 
easily pass-through the ORF to their 
customers. In the original ORF filing by 
Cboe Exchange. Inc. (‘‘Cboe Options’’), 
an affiliate of EDGX Options,
8
Cboe 
Options stated that it expected its 
members to pass-through the ORF to 
their customers in the same manner that 
firms pass-through to their customers 
the fees charged by self-regulatory 
organizations (‘‘SROs’’) to help the 
SROs meet their obligations under 
Section 31 of the Exchange Act (and the 
Exchange understands this to be the 
case currently). Accordingly, in scenario 
4 above, the ORF is collected from the 
non-Member OCC Clearing Member that 
clears the transaction in order to 
facilitate the pass-through of the ORF to 
the end-customer. Likewise, collection 
of the ORF from the ultimate (CMTA) 
clearing firm facilitates the passing the 
fee through to the end-customer. In 
those cases where the ORF is collected 
from a non-Member, the Exchange 
(through OCC) collects the ORF as a 
convenience for the Member whose 
obligation it is to pay the fee to the 
Exchange. 
ORF Revenue and Monitoring of ORF 
Today, revenue generated from ORF, 
when combined with all of the 
Exchange’s other regulatory fees and 
fines, is designed to recover a material 
portion of the regulatory costs to the 
Exchange of the supervision and 
regulation of Member customer options 
business including performing routine 
surveillances, investigations, 
examinations, financial monitoring, and 
policy, rulemaking, interpretive, and 
enforcement activities. Regulatory costs 
include direct regulatory expenses and 
certain indirect expenses for work 
allocated in support of the regulatory 
function. The direct expenses include 
in-house and third-party service 
provider costs to support the day-to-day 
regulatory work such as surveillances, 
investigations and examinations. The 
indirect expenses include support to the 
regulatory function from such areas as 
human resources, legal, compliance, 
information technology, facilities and 
accounting. Today, these indirect 
expenses are estimated to be 
approximately 34% of the Exchange’s 
total regulatory costs for 2026. Thus, 
direct expenses are estimated to be 
approximately 66% of total regulatory 
costs for 2026.
9
In addition, based on 
the Exchange’s analysis of its regulatory 
work associated with options regulation, 
and considering other regulatory 
revenue, it is the Exchange’s practice 
that revenue generated from ORF not 
exceed more than 75% of total annual 
regulatory costs. 
Proposal for On-Exchange ORF 
EDGX Options appreciates the 
evolving changes in the market and 
regulatory environment and has been 
evaluating its current methodologies 
and practices for the assessment and 
collection of ORF while considering 
industry and Commission feedback. As 
a result of this review, the Exchange is 
proposing the On-Exchange ORF, which 
assesses a regulatory fee to only 
Exchange transactions that would clear 
in the Customer range at OCC (as is the 
case today).
10
The following scenarios 
reflect how the On-Exchange ORF will 
be assessed and collected: 
1. If a Member is the Executing 
Clearing Firm on a transaction that 
occurred on the Exchange, the fee 
would be assessed to and collected from 
that Member by OCC on behalf of the 
Exchange. 
2. If a Member is the Executing 
Clearing Firm and the transaction is 
‘‘given up’’ to a Clearing Give-Up, the 
On-Exchange ORF is assessed to the 
Executing Clearing Firm (the On- 
Exchange ORF remains the obligation of 
the Executing Clearing Firm under the 
proposal), but the On-Exchange ORF 
will be collected from the Clearing Give- 
Up. 
The Exchange expects to provide 
Members sufficient information in 
connection with their invoice in order 
to reconcile charges associated with 
ORF. In addition, the proposed method 
for collecting On-Exchange ORF will 
only consider CMTAs reported to the 
Exchange and not those reported 
directly to OCC. As described above, 
today’s ORF is the responsibility of the 
Executing Clearing Firm and collected 
from the CMTA (which may be a non- 
Member) as an administrative 
convenience. The Exchange 
understands that a CMTA may be added 
at order entry, via post-trade edit on the 
Exchange, or post-trade at OCC. CMTA 
transfers that occur at OCC do not 
necessarily contain reliable information 
regarding the Exchange on which the 
original transaction occurred.
11
Without 
specific information as to where the 
original transaction occurred, the 
Exchange would not be able to 
accurately account for CMTA transfers 
that occur at OCC. Therefore, the 
Exchange will only account for CMTAs 
that occur on the Exchange (which may 
be a non-Member) and exclude CMTAs 
occurring at OCC.

8, 2025) (SR–Phlx–2025–30)). As proposed, these 
filings also will consider CMTAs reported to the 
respective exchange and not CMTAs reported 
directly to OCC. 
13
The Exchange estimates it will take 
approximately three months to implement the 
system changes associated with On-Exchange ORF. 
14
Depending on the operative date for the filing, 
the Exchange will submit an additional filing to 
specify the ORF rate based on the then-current 
estimates for regulatory revenues, regulatory costs 
and Customer volume. 
15
Direct expenses include in-house and third- 
party service provider costs to support the day-to- 
day regulatory work such as surveillances, 
investigations, and examinations.

Indirect expenses include support from areas 
such as human resources, legal, compliance, 
information technology, facilities and accounting.

15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5). 
With this proposal, the Exchange 
intends to collect ORF under its current 
methodology for assessment and 
collection of ORF until at least June 30, 
2026. The Exchange is prepared to 
implement On-Exchange ORF effective 
July 1, 2026 if by April 1, 2026 all U.S. 
options exchanges charging an ORF 
have filed to modify their current 
methodologies of assessment of the fee 
to limit the fee to transactions occurring 
on their respective exchange.
13
 
However, if all other options exchanges 
have not filed to adopt a similar 
methodology by April 1st, the Exchange 
will delay implementation 
commensurate with the additional time 
required for other options exchanges to 
adopt a similar method for collection 
and assessment of ORF. The Exchange 
will at that time file a separate rule 
filing with the amount of the On- 
Exchange ORF in advance of assessing 
and collecting the fee under the 
proposed method. The Exchange will 
provide at least 30 days’ notice of the 
applicable On-Exchange ORF rate. The 
Exchange believes a fee to recover [sic] 
costs for regulatory programs associated 
with Member customer business is 
reasonable; however, the Exchange 
would consider alternative approaches 
for assessment and collection of the fee 
in order to achieve consistency across 
the industry. 
To demonstrate the impact of the 
proposed change, the Exchange 
estimates that, if the On-Exchange ORF 
went into effect today, the current ORF 
of $0.0001 per contract side would 
increase to $0.00274 per contract side 
using 2026 estimates for regulatory 
revenue, regulatory costs and customer 
volume.
14
As is the case today, revenue 
generated from On-Exchange ORF, 
when combined with all of the 
Exchange’s other regulatory fees and 
fines, is designed to recover a material 
portion of the regulatory costs to the 
Exchange of the supervision and 
regulation of Member customer options 
business, including performing routine 
surveillances, investigations, 
examinations, financial monitoring, and 
policy, rulemaking, interpretive, and 
enforcement activities. As discussed 
above, regulatory costs include direct 
regulatory expenses
15
and certain 
indirect expenses in support of the 
regulatory function.
16
Indirect expenses 
are estimated to be approximately 34% 
of the Exchange’s total regulatory costs 
for 2026. Thus, direct expenses are 
estimated to be approximately 66% of 
total regulatory costs for 2026. 
The Exchange will continue to 
monitor the amount of revenue 
collected from On-Exchange ORF to 
ensure that it, in combination with its 
other regulatory fees and fines, does not 
exceed the Exchange’s total regulatory 
costs. Further, EDGX Options expects to 
continue its current practice that 
revenue generated from On-Exchange 
ORF not exceed more than [sic] 75% of 
total annual regulatory costs. And as is 
the Exchange’s practice today, revenue 
generated by On-Exchange ORF will not 
be used for non-regulatory purposes. 
The Exchange will continue to 
monitor its regulatory costs and 
revenues at a minimum on a semi- 
annual basis. If the Exchange 
determines regulatory revenues exceed 
or are insufficient to cover a material 
portion of its regulatory costs in a given 
year, the Exchange will adjust the On- 
Exchange ORF by submitting a fee 
change filing to the Commission. The 
Exchange will notify Members of 
adjustments to the On-Exchange ORF 
via an Exchange Notice in advance of 
any change.
17
 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the Act 
and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
18
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) 
of the Act,
19
which provides that 
Exchange rules may provide for the 
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees, and other charges among its 
Members and other persons using its 
facilities. Additionally, the Exchange 
believes the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the Section 6(b)(5)
20
 
requirement that the rules of an 
exchange not be designed to permit 
unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
change to assess and collect an On- 
Exchange ORF is reasonable, equitable 
and not unfairly discriminatory for 
various reasons. First, On-Exchange 
ORF is reasonable, equitable and not 
unfairly discriminatory in that it is 
charged to all Exchange transactions 
that clear in the Customer range at the 
OCC. Similar to ORF today, the 
Exchange believes On-Exchange ORF 
ensures fairness by assessing a specific 
fee to those Members that require more 
Exchange regulatory services based on 
the amount of customer options 
business they conduct. Over recent 
years, options trading volume has 
increased with a growing percentage of 
the volume applicable to customer 
transactions. Customers trading on the 
Exchange (through a Member) benefit 
from the protections of a robust 
regulatory program including the 
maintenance of fair and orderly markets 
and protections against fraud and other 
manipulation. The Exchange believes it 
is equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory to assess a regulatory fee 
to transactions that clear in the 
Customer range to cover regulatory 
costs, but not to transactions clearing in 
the Firm or Market Maker range because 
Clearing Members and Market Makers 
(who clear in the Firm and Market 
Maker range), as those market 
participants are generally subject to 
other Exchange fees, fines and 
obligations. For example, Clearing 
Members and Market Makers are 
required to pay Exchange application 
fees, permit fees, and connectivity fees, 
amongst others. In addition, all fines 
issued by the Exchange for regulatory 
infractions are assessed only to 
Members and would be applied to 
regulatory revenues. As with today’s 
ORF, the Exchange expects that 
Members from whom On-Exchange ORF 
is collected will pass through the fee to 
their customers (as the Exchange 
understands occurs today). In addition, 
Market Makers in particular are subject 
to various quoting and other obligations 
to ensure that they provide stable and 
liquid markets, which benefit all market 
participants including customers. 
Excluding Market Maker transactions

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159278 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices 21
If the Exchange changes its method of funding 
regulation or if circumstances otherwise change in 
the future, the Exchange may decide to modify On- 
Exchange ORF or assess a separate regulatory fee on 
Member proprietary transactions if the Exchange 
deems it advisable. 
22
As of October 1, 2025. 
23
Under the current methodology for assessing 
ORF, the Exchange on which the transaction 
occurred is irrelevant. 
24
Consistent with Rule 15.2 (Regulatory 
Revenues), the Exchange notes that should excess 
ORF revenue be collected prior to any reduction in 
an ORF rate, such excess revenue will not be used 
for nonregulatory purposes. 
from On-Exchange ORF will allow 
Market Makers to better manage their 
costs more effectively thus enabling 
them to better allocate resources toward 
technology, risk management, and 
capacity to ensure continued liquidity 
provision. 
In addition to the overall increase in 
Customer-range volume generally, 
regulating customer trading activity is 
more labor intensive and requires 
greater expenditure of human and 
technical resources than regulating non- 
customer trading activity, which tends 
to be more automated and less labor- 
intensive. For example, there are costs 
associated with main office and branch 
office examinations (e.g., staff and travel expenses), as well as investigations into 
customer complaints and terminations 
of Registered Persons. As a result, the 
costs associated with administering the 
customer component of the Exchange’s 
overall regulatory program are 
materially higher than the costs 
associated with administering the non- 
customer component (e.g., Clearing Member proprietary transactions) of its 
regulatory program.
21
While the 
Exchange notes that it has broad 
regulatory responsibilities with respect 
to its Members’ activities, irrespective of 
where their transactions take place, the 
Exchange believes it is reasonable to 
assess the proposed fee to only those 
transactions occurring on the Exchange. 
The proposed change more narrowly 
tailors the fee to products and 
transactions with a direct connection to 
the Exchange. Today, a customer 
transaction may be assessed an ORF 
from every options exchange totaling as 
much as $0.0187 per transaction per 
side.
22
While the Exchange’s proposed 
ORF rate under the proposed model of 
$0.00274 is higher than its current ORF 
rate of $0.0001 under the current model, 
if all exchanges adopted a similar on- 
exchange model, ORF rates may 
decrease for individual transactions 
overall because the proposed On- 
Exchange ORF will avoid overlapping 
ORFs that would otherwise be assessed 
by EDGX Options and other options 
exchanges that also assess an ORF. With 
this proposal, transactions that would 
clear in the Customer range occurring 
on other exchanges would no longer be 
subject to an ORF assessed by EDGX 
Options. 
The Exchange believes it is equitable 
and not unduly discriminatory to 
modify the method of collecting the fee 
such that On-Exchange ORF will not 
consider CMTAs reported directly to 
OCC as is done in today’s method of 
ORF. CMTA transfers are considered 
today under the current collection 
methodology for ORF as a convenience 
to industry members in administering a 
pass through of the fee to their 
customers. Limiting the On-Exchange 
ORF to transactions on the Exchange 
poses a limitation in the use of CMTA 
for this purpose. The Exchange 
understands that a CMTA may be added 
at order entry, via post-trade edit on the 
Exchange, or post-trade at OCC. CMTA 
transfers that occur at OCC do not 
necessarily contain reliable information 
regarding the Exchange on which the 
original transaction occurred.
23
Without 
specific information as to where the 
original transaction occurred, the 
Exchange would not be able to 
accurately account for CMTA transfers 
that occur at OCC. 
The Exchange also believes that the 
fact that a Consolidated Audit Trail 
(‘‘CAT’’) fee is in place should not 
preclude the Exchange from assessing 
On-Exchange ORF. The CAT is a 
repository of order, trade and customer 
information that is used as the basis for 
an audit trail of such activities. Like 
industry members, the exchanges, 
including EDGX Options, also pays a 
CAT fee to support the operation and 
maintenance of CAT (in other words, it 
does not support regulatory work 
undertaken by exchanges). EDGX 
Options does not include fees it pays for 
CAT in the regulatory expenses it looks 
to offset under ORF. Yes, the Exchange 
uses CAT data as part of its regulatory 
work, but only from an audit trail 
perspective. On-Exchange ORF, on the 
other hand, offsets the regulatory work 
the Exchange performs (using CAT data 
among other sources) such as 
surveillance, investigations, 
examinations, etc. The Exchange 
believes its fair and reasonable to assess 
an On-Exchange ORF in addition to fees 
associated with CAT. 
The Exchange further believes that the 
proposed change to the method for 
assessment and collection of the fee is 
reasonable because it would help ensure 
that revenue collected from the On- 
Exchange ORF, in combination with 
other regulatory fees and fines, would 
help offset, but not exceed, the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. As 
discussed, On-Exchange ORF is 
similarly designed to the current ORF, 
in that revenues generated from the fee 
would be less than or equal to 75% of 
the Exchange’s regulatory costs, which 
is consistent with the practice across the 
options industry today and the view of 
the Commission that regulatory fees be 
used for regulatory purposes and not to 
support the Exchange’s business side. 
As noted above, the Exchange will 
also continue to monitor on at least a 
semi-annual basis the amount of 
revenue collected from the On-Exchange 
ORF, even as amended, to ensure that it, 
in combination with its other regulatory 
fees and fines, does not exceed the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. If the 
Exchange determines regulatory 
revenues would exceed its regulatory 
costs in a given year, the Exchange will 
reduce the On-Exchange ORF by 
submitting a fee change filing to the 
Commission.
24
 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. This 
proposal does not create an unnecessary 
or inappropriate intra-market burden on 
competition because On-Exchange ORF 
applies to all customer activity on the 
Exchange, thereby raising regulatory 
revenue to offset regulatory expenses. It 
also supplements the regulatory revenue 
derived from non-customer activity. The 
Exchange notes, however, the proposed 
change is not designed to address any 
competitive issues. Indeed, this 
proposal does not create an unnecessary 
or inappropriate inter-market burden on 
competition because it is a regulatory 
fee that supports regulation in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
The Exchange is obligated to ensure that 
the amount of regulatory revenue 
collected from the On-Exchange ORF, in 
combination with its other regulatory 
fees and fines, does not exceed 
regulatory costs. In addition, the 
Exchange will not implement the On- 
Exchange ORF until all other options 
exchanges are prepared to adopt a 
similar model to avoid overlapping 
ORFs. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received written comments on the 
proposed rule change.

Implementing Certain Tariff-Related 
Elements of the Framework for a 
United States—Switzerland— 
Liechtenstein Agreement on Fair, 
Balanced, and Reciprocal Trade 
AGENCY: International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of 
Commerce, and the Office of the United 
States Trade Representative. 
ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: On September 5, 2025, President Trump issued Executive 
Order 14346 (Modifying the Scope of 
Reciprocal Tariffs and Establishing 
Procedures for Implementing Trade and 
Security Agreements). Executive Order 
14346 directed and authorized the 
Secretary of Commerce and the United 
States Trade Representative to take the 
necessary and appropriate steps to 
implement any current or forthcoming 
trade and security framework 
agreements between a foreign trading 
partner and the United States. On 
November 14, 2025, the United States, 
Switzerland, and Liechtenstein 
announced a Framework to negotiate an 
Agreement on Fair, Balanced, and 
Reciprocal Trade, and have agreed to 
modification of certain tariff rates. This 
notice amends the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States to 
implement the elements of the 
Framework to apply the higher of either 
the U.S. most-favored-nation tariff rate 
or a tariff rate of 15 percent, comprised 
of the most-favored-nation tariff and a 
reciprocal tariff, on products of 
Switzerland or Liechtenstein, and to 
adjust tariffs on certain articles that are 
products of Switzerland or 
Liechtenstein, including certain 
agricultural goods, unavailable natural 
resources, aircraft and aircraft parts, and 
generic pharmaceuticals and their 
ingredients and chemical precursors. 
The United States has agreed to modify 
these tariff rates with the understanding 
and expectation that the Agreement on 
Fair, Balanced, and Reciprocal Trade 
will be successfully negotiated by the 
first quarter of 2026. If the Agreement is 
not successfully negotiated by March 
31, 2026, the United States will review 
and reconsider these modifications, as 
appropriate. 
DATES: This notice is effective December 18, 2025. The Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States 
modifications set out in Annex II to this 
notice are effective with respect to 
goods entered for consumption, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. 
eastern time on November 14, 2025.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
In Executive Order 14346 of 
September 5, 2025 (Modifying the Scope 
of Reciprocal Tariffs and Establishing 
Procedures for Implementing Trade and 
Security Agreements), President Trump 
determined, among other things, that it 
is necessary and appropriate to take 
steps contemplated in certain current 
and forthcoming trade and security 
agreements between a foreign trading 
partner and the United States and that 
any modification of tariffs required to 
implement such agreements is necessary 
and appropriate to deal with the 
national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 
(Regulating Imports with a Reciprocal 
Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices that 
Contribute to Large and Persistent 
Annual United States Goods Trade 
Deficits). 
Executive Order 14346 also directed 
and authorized the Secretary of 
Commerce (Secretary) and the United 
States Trade Representative (Trade 
Representative) to determine whether 
the United States must take any action 
to implement a final agreement, and to 
take such actions as necessary and 
appropriate. It also directed and 
authorized the Secretary, the Secretary 
of Homeland Security, and the Trade 
Representative to take all necessary 
action to implement and effectuate that 
order and any actions taken under 
section 3 or section 4 of that order, and 
to employ all powers granted to the 
President as may be necessary to do so. 
That Executive Order also directs the 
Secretary and the Trade Representative, 
in consultation with the Commissioner 
of U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) and the Chair of the United States 
International Trade Commission 
(USITC), to determine whether 
modifications to the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) 
are necessary to effectuate that order 
and actions taken under that order and 
authorizes them to direct such 
modifications through notice in the 
Federal Register. 
On November 14, 2025, the United 
States, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein 
announced a Framework to negotiate an 
Agreement on Fair, Balanced, and 
Reciprocal Trade (Agreement). The 
Framework provides, among other 
things, that the United States intends to 
apply the higher of either the U.S. most- 
favored-nation (MFN) tariff rate or a 
tariff rate of 15 percent, comprised of 
the MFN tariff and a reciprocal tariff, on 
products of Switzerland or 
Liechtenstein, and that with respect to 
certain products of Switzerland and 
certain products of Liechtenstein, the 
United States shall not apply the 
additional ad valorem rate of duty applicable to those goods as provided 
for in Executive Order 14257, as 
amended. 
Consistent with Executive Order 
14346, the Secretary and the Trade 
Representative have determined that the 
additional ad valorem rate of duty applicable to any article the product of 
Switzerland or Liechtenstein shall be 
determined by the article’s current ad 
valorem (or ad valorem equivalent) rate of duty under column 1 (General) of the 
HTSUS (‘‘Column 1 Duty Rate’’). For an 
article the product of Switzerland or 
Liechtenstein with a Column 1 Duty 
Rate that is less than 15 percent, the 
sum of its Column 1 Duty Rate and the 
additional ad valorem rate of duty pursuant to this notice shall be 15 
percent ad valorem. For an article the product of Switzerland or Liechtenstein 
with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is at 
least 15 percent, the additional ad 
valorem rate of duty pursuant to this notice shall be zero. 
Additionally, in order to implement 
certain tariff-related elements of the 
Framework, the Secretary and the Trade 
Representative have determined that

certain products of Liechtenstein 
contained in the Potential Tariff 
Adjustments for Aligned Partners 
(PTAAP) Annex and provided in Annex 
I to this notice shall be exempted from 
the reciprocal tariff imposed by 
Executive Order 14257, as amended. 
Accordingly, the HTSUS is modified as 
provided for in Annex II to this notice 
with respect to goods entered for 
consumption, or withdrawn from 
warehouse for consumption, on or after 
12:01 a.m. eastern time on November 
14, 2025. To the extent that 
implementation of this notice requires a 
refund of duties collected, refunds shall 
be processed pursuant to applicable law 
and the standard procedures of CBP for 
such refunds. The United States has 
agreed to modify these tariff rates with 
the understanding and expectation that 
the Agreement will be successfully 
negotiated by the first quarter of 2026. 
If the Agreement is not successfully 
negotiated by March 31, 2026, the 
United States will review and 
reconsider these modifications, as 
appropriate. 
Executive Order 14346 provides that 
the Secretary and the Trade 
Representative, in consultation with 
other officials, are to continue to 
monitor the conditions underlying the 
national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 14257, update the 
President on the status of these 
conditions, inform the President of any 
circumstance that, in their opinion, 
might indicate the need for further 
action, and recommend additional 
action that, in their opinion, will more 
effectively deal with that emergency. 
Accordingly, the annexes to this notice 
may be amended.

Proclamation No. 7746 of December 30, 
2003 (68 FR 75789) implemented the 
Chile FTA on behalf of the United States 
and modified the HTSUS to reflect the 
tariff treatment provided for in the Chile 
FTA. 
Note 3(a) to subchapter XXII of 
HTSUS chapter 98 requires USTR to 
publish annually a determination of the 
amount of Chile’s trade surplus, by 
volume, with all sources for goods in 
Harmonized System (HS) subheadings

1702.40 and 1702.60 that are originating 
goods under the Colombia TPA and 
Colombia’s exports to the United States 
of goods classified under subheadings 
1701.12, 1701.13, 1701.14, 1701.91 and 
1701.99 are not included in the 
calculation of Colombia’s trade surplus. 
Note 32(c)(i) to subchapter XXII of 
HTSUS chapter 98 provides duty-free 
treatment for certain sugar goods of 
Colombia entered under subheading 
9822.08.01 in an amount equal to the 
lesser of Colombia’s trade surplus or the 
specific quantity set out in that note for 
that calendar year. 
During CY 2024, the most recent year 
for which data are available, Colombia’s 
exports of the sugar and syrup goods 
and sugar-containing products 
described above exceeded its imports of 
those goods by 141,864 metric tons 
according to data published by the 
Colombian National Tax and Customs 
Directorate (DIAN). Based on these data, 
USTR has determined that Colombia’s 
trade surplus is 141,864 metric tons. 
The specific quantity set out in U.S. 
Note 32(c)(i) to subchapter XXII of 
HTSUS chapter 98 for Colombia for CY 
2026 is 60,500 metric tons. Therefore, in 
accordance with that note, the aggregate 
quantity of goods of Colombia that may 
be entered duty-free under subheading 
9822.08.01 in CY 2026 is 60,500 metric 
tons (i.e., the amount that is the lesser of Colombia’s trade surplus and the 
specific quantity set out in that note for 
Colombia for CY 2026). 
VI. Panama TPA 
Pursuant to section 201 of the United 
States-Panama Trade Promotion 
Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 
112–43; 19 U.S.C. 3805 note), 
Presidential Proclamation No. 8894 of 
October 29, 2012 (77 FR 66505) 
implemented the Panama TPA on behalf 
of the United States and modified the 
HTSUS to reflect the tariff treatment 
provided for in the Panama TPA. 
Note 35(a) to subchapter XXII of 
HTSUS chapter 98 requires USTR to 
publish annually a determination of the 
amount of Panama’s trade surplus, by 
volume, with all sources for goods in HS 
subheadings 1701.12, 1701.13, 1701.14, 
1701.91, 1701.99, 1702.40 and 1702.60, 
except that Panama’s imports of U.S. 
goods classified under subheadings 
1702.40 and 1702.60 that are originating 
goods under the Panama TPA and 
Panama’s exports to the United States of 
goods classified under subheadings 
1701.12, 1701.13, 1701.14, 1701.91 and 
1701.99 are not included in the 
calculation of Panama’s trade surplus. 
Note 35(c) to subchapter XXII of 
HTSUS chapter 98 provides duty-free 
treatment for certain sugar goods of 
Panama entered under subheading 
9822.09.17 in an amount equal to the 
lesser of Panama’s trade surplus or the 
specific quantity set out in that note for 
that calendar year. 
During CY 2024, the most recent year 
for which data are available, Panama’s 
imports of the sugar and syrup goods 
and sugar-containing products 
described above exceeded its exports of 
those goods by 146 metric tons 
according to data published by the 
National Institute of Statistics and 
Census, Office of the General 
Comptroller of Panama; and the 
Ministry of Commerce and Industry of 
Panama. Based on these data, USTR has determined that Panama’s trade surplus 
is negative. Therefore, in accordance 
with that Note, goods of Panama are not 
eligible to enter the United States duty- 
free under subheading 9822.09.17 in CY 
2026.

See 80 FR 746. This final rule was subsequently amended on June 10, 2016, in response to a petition 
for reconsideration submitted by the Association of 
American Railroads. See 81 FR 37521. The FAA has received a third-party 
request for the release of the 
aforementioned engineering data under 
the provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. 
The FAA cannot release commercial or 
financial information under FOIA 
without the permission of the data 
owner. However, in accordance with 
title 49 of the United States Code 
§ 44704(a)(5), the FAA can provide STC 
‘‘engineering data’’ it possesses for STC 
maintenance or improvement, upon 
request, if the following conditions are 
met: 
1. The FAA determines the STC has 
been inactive for 3 years or more; 
2. Using due diligence, the FAA is 
unable to locate the owner of record or 
the owner of record’s heir; and 
3. The availability of such data will 
enhance aviation safety. 
There has been no activity on this 
STC for more than 3 years. 
On April 18, 2025, the FAA sent a 
certified letter to Stephen M. Hill at his 
last known addresses: 151 Chase Street, 
Florence, SC 29501 and 1300 Pickney 
Avenue, Florence, SC 29501. The letter 
informed Stephen M. Hill that the FAA 
had received a request for engineering 
data related to STC No. SA1584SW and 
was conducting a due diligence search 
to determine whether the STC was 
inactive and may be considered 
abandoned. The letter further requested 
Mr. Stephen M. Hill to respond in 
writing within 60 days and state 
whether he is the holder of the STC. The 
FAA also attempted to contact Stephen 
M. Hill by other means, including 
telephone communication, email, 
registered mail, etc., without success. 
Information Requested 
If you are the owner or heir or a 
transferee of STC No. SA1584SW or 
have any knowledge regarding who may 
now hold STC No. SA1584SW, please 
contact Richard Bolden using a method 
described in this notice under 
FOR 
FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. If you 
are the heir of the owner, or the owner 
by transfer, of STC No. SA1584SW, you 
must provide a notarized copy of your 
government-issued identification with a 
letter and background establishing your 
ownership of the STC and, if applicable, 
your relationship as the heir to the 
deceased holder of the STC. 
Conclusion 
If the FAA does not receive any 
response by June 16, 2026, the FAA will 
consider STC No. SA1584SW 
abandoned, and the FAA will proceed 
with the release of the requested data. 
This action is for the purpose of 
maintaining the airworthiness of an 
aircraft and enhancing aviation safety.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501–3520, and its 
implementing regulations, 5 CFR part 
1320, require Federal agencies to issue 
two notices seeking public comment on 
information collection activities before 
OMB may approve paperwork packages. 
See 44 U.S.C. 3506, 3507; 5 CFR 1320.8 through 1320.12. On September 12, 
2025, FRA published a 60-day notice in 
the Federal Register soliciting public comment on the ICR for which it is now 
seeking OMB approval. See 90 FR 44286. FRA has received no comments 
related to the proposed collection of 
information. 
Before OMB decides whether to 
approve this proposed collection of 
information, it must provide 30 days’ 
notice for public comment. Federal law 
requires OMB to approve or disapprove 
paperwork packages between 30 and 60 
days after the 30-day notice is 
published. 44 U.S.C. 3507(b) and (c); 5 
CFR 1320.12(d); see also 60 FR 44978, 
44983 (Aug. 29, 1995). The 30-day 
notice informs the regulated community 
of their opportunity to file relevant 
comments and affords the agency 
adequate time to consider public 
comments before it renders a decision. 
60 FR 44983 (Aug. 29, 1995). Therefore, 
respondents should submit their 
respective comments to OMB within 30 
days of publication to best ensure 
having their full effect. 
Comments are invited on the 
following ICR regarding: (1) whether the 
information collection activities are 
necessary for FRA to properly execute 
its functions, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; 
(2) the accuracy of FRA’s estimates of 
the burden of the information collection 
activities, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used to 
determine the estimates; (3) ways for 
FRA to enhance the quality, utility, and 
clarity of the information being 
collected; and (4) ways to minimize the 
burden of information collection 
activities on the public, including the 
use of automated collection techniques 
or other forms of information 
technology. 
The summary below describes the ICR 
that FRA will submit for OMB clearance 
as the PRA requires:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), Federal 
agencies must obtain approval from the 
OMB for each collection of information 
that they conduct or sponsor. 
‘‘Collection of information’’ is defined 
in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 
1320.3(c) to include agency requests or 
requirements, imposed on ten or more 
persons, that members of the public 
submit reports, keep records, or provide 
information to a third party. Section 
3506(c)(2)(A) of title 44 generally 
requires Federal agencies to provide a 
60-day notice in the Federal Register 
concerning each proposed collection of 
information, including each proposed 
extension of an existing collection of 
information, before submitting the 
collection to OMB for approval. To 
comply with this requirement, the OCC 
is publishing notice of the renewal of 
this collection. 
Title: Securities Exchange Act Disclosure Rules. 
OMB Control No.: 1557–0106. 
Type of Review: Regular. 
Affected Public: Businesses or other 
for-profit. 
Description: This submission covers an existing regulation and involves no 
change to the regulation or to the 
information collection requirements. 
The OCC requests only that OMB 
approve its revised burden estimates. 
The Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) is required by statute 
to collect, in accordance with its 
regulations, certain information and 
documents from any firm that is 
required to register its stock with the 
SEC. Federal law requires the OCC to 
apply similar regulations to any national 
bank or Federal savings association 
similarly required to be registered with 
the SEC (generally those with a class of 
equity securities held by 2,000 or more 
shareholders). 12 CFR part 11 ensures 
that a national bank or Federal savings 
association whose securities are subject 
to registration provides adequate 
information about its operations to 
current and potential shareholders and 
the public. The OCC reviews the 
information to ensure that it complies 
with Federal law and makes public all 
information required to be filed under 
the rule. 
Estimated Frequency of Response: On 
occasion. 
Estimated Number of Respondents: 
80.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
TRIA—which established TRIP—was 
signed into law on November 26, 2002, 
following the attacks of September 11, 
2001, to address disruptions in the 
market for terrorism risk insurance, to 
help ensure the continued availability 
and affordability of commercial 
property and casualty insurance for 
terrorism risk, and to allow for the 
private markets to stabilize and build 
insurance capacity to absorb any future 
losses for terrorism events.
1
TRIA 
requires insurers to ‘‘make available’’ 
terrorism risk insurance for commercial 
property and casualty losses resulting 
from certified acts of terrorism, and 
provides for shared public and private 
compensation for such insured losses. 
The Program has been reauthorized four 
times, most recently by the Terrorism 
Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization 
Act of 2019.
2
The Secretary of the 
Treasury (Secretary) administers the 
Program, with assistance from the 
Federal Insurance Office (FIO).
3
 
TRIA provides for an ‘‘industry 
marketplace aggregate retention 
amount’’ or ‘‘IMARA’’ to be used for 
determining whether Treasury must 
recoup any payments it makes under the 
Program. Under the Act, if total annual 
payments by all participating insurers 
are below the IMARA, then Treasury 
must recoup all amounts expended by it 
up to the IMARA threshold. If total 
annual payments by all participating 
insurers are above the IMARA, then 
Treasury has the discretionary authority 
(but not the obligation) to recoup all of 
the expended amounts that are above 
the IMARA threshold.
4
 
TRIA provides for a schedule of 
defined IMARA values from calendar 
year 2015 through calendar year 2019.
5
 
For calendar year 2020 and beyond, 
TRIA states that the IMARA ‘‘shall be 
revised to be the amount equal to the 
annual average of the sum of insurer 
deductibles for all insurers participating 
in the Program for the prior 3 calendar 
years,’’ as such sum is determined 
pursuant to final rules issued by the 
Secretary.
6
 
On November 15, 2019, Treasury 
issued a final rule for calculation of the 
IMARA.
7
This rule, which is codified at 
31 CFR 50.4(m)(2), provides that the 
IMARA will be calculated by averaging 
the annual industry aggregate 
deductibles over the prior three 
calendar years, based upon the direct 
earned premiums (DEP) reported to 
Treasury by insurers in Treasury’s 
annual data calls. Insurer deductibles 
under the Program are based upon the 
DEP of individual insurers reported to 
Treasury in the prior year (e.g., 2024 DEP for 2025 calendar year program 
deductibles). 
Accordingly, for purposes of 
determining the IMARA for calendar 
2026, Treasury has averaged the 
aggregate insurer deductibles for 
calendar years 2025, 2024, and 2023 (as 
reported to Treasury in each of these 
years), which are based on the reported 
DEP for calendar years 2024, 2023, and 
2022, respectively.

Treasury has used these reported 
premiums to calculate the IMARA for 
calendar year 2026. The average annual 
DEP figure for the combined period of 
2022, 2023, and 2024 is 
$293,365,903,330 [($$269,460,403,215 + 
$291,438,878,341 + 319,198,428,435)/3 
= $293,365,903,330]. The average 
aggregate deductible for the prior three 
years is 20 percent of $293,365,903,330, 
which equals $58,673,180,666.

Accordingly, the IMARA for purposes of 
calendar year 2026 is $58,673,180,666.

Response to Comments for the 
Department of Veterans Affairs to 
Assess the Current Scientific 
Literature and Historical Detailed 
Claims Data Regarding Exposure to 
Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances 
(PFAS) and Kidney Cancer 
AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: On September 26, 2024, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
solicited public comments on VA’s plan 
to assess the current scientific literature 
and historical claims data regarding 
exposure to Per- and polyfluoroalkyl 
substances (PFAS) and kidney cancer. 
The notice provided an opportunity for 
veterans, caregivers, survivors, and the 
public to share relevant information 
with VA to inform decisions regarding 
presumptive benefits that could impact 
veterans who may have experienced 
environmental and/or occupational 
exposures to PFAS during military 
service. Additionally, VA held a virtual 
public listening session on November 
19, 2024, for the public to provide 
feedback on the planned assessment. 
This notice provides VA’s responses to 
comments received from the public. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Erin Dursa, Ph.D., MPH, Director of 
Surveillance Military Environmental 
Exposures, Health Outcomes Military 
Exposures, Veterans Health 
Administration, (202) 461–7297. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 26, 2024, VA published a 
notice in the Federal Register to inform 
the public that it had plans to assess the 
relationship between exposure to PFAS 
and kidney cancer. 89 FR 78986. VA 
received 42 comments from veterans, 
family members, Veterans Service 
Organizations (VSOs), and other 
members of the public in response to 
the notice. Overall, comments 
supported VA’s plan to assess the 
scientific literature and historical claims 
data to determine whether there is an 
association between PFAS and kidney 
cancer. 
Thirty-six comments were positive 
and/or in agreement with VA’s planned 
scientific assessment, while the 
remaining six were neutral. No 
comments disagreed with the planned 
scientific assessment. Seventeen 
comments provided veteran testimony, 
exposure experience, or personal 
medical history. Thirteen comments 
voiced concern that kidney cancer is a 
narrow scope of possible conditions 
associated with PFAS exposure. Ten 
comments were requests to establish 
kidney cancer as a presumptive service- 
connected condition due to possible 
PFAS exposure. The remaining two 
comments requested benefits 
consideration. Twenty-two comments 
spoke to exposures at a specific location 
or in an occupation; of those, nine 
comments discussed firefighting foam/ 
gear as the chief exposure concern. 
Eight comments discussed medical 
conditions other than kidney cancer. 
Three comments dealt with exposures 
other than PFAS. Of the remaining nine 
comments, six dealt with personal 
medical histories, two provided 
scientific evidence, and one was 
unclear. 
Discussion on Comments 
With the enactment of Sergeant First 
Class Heath Robinson Honoring our 
Promise to Address Comprehensive 
Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), VA 
enhanced the presumptive decision- 
making process to align with 38 U.S.C. 
1171–1176 and implement 
recommendations from National 
Academies of Science, Engineering, and 
Medicine’s (NASEM) review of the 
process. Under the current enhanced 
process, every year VA announces in the 
Federal Register plans for formal 
evaluations. VA also invites comments 
and holds an open meeting for the 
public to provide input. 
In accordance with this process, VA 
established a working group called the 
Military Environmental Exposure Sub- 
Council to conduct ongoing surveillance 
and scientific assessments that may lead 
to a recommendation for formal 
evaluation. The duration of a scientific 
assessment is dependent on the 
availability, volume, and complexity of 
relevant literature and data. VA is 
required to complete formal evaluations 
within 120 days in accordance with the 
requirements in 38 U.S.C. 1173. 
At this time, VA will focus solely on 
the possibility of a relationship between

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159326 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices PFAS exposure and kidney cancer for 
the current scientific assessment. Other 
conditions that are possibly associated 
with PFAS exposure may be considered 
for future assessments. The scientific 
assessment committee will be provided 
the details from the comments that 
include veteran testimonies and 
exposure experiences. If the assessment 
results in a formal evaluation, the 
veteran testimonies and exposure 
experiences will also be provided to the 
formal evaluation team for 
consideration. 
VA agrees that the NASEM report 
‘‘Guidance on PFAS Exposure, Testing, 
and Clinical Follow-up’’ (2022) is an 
important resource, and it will be one of 
several resources VA uses to inform its 
scientific assessment. However, under 
the PACT Act and 38 U.S.C. 1172, VA 
follows a specific process to support any 
decisions regarding creating new 
presumptions of service-connection. 
This process generally includes a 
scientific assessment, which requires 
convening an interagency expert panel 
and reviewing relevant peer-reviewed 
scientific literature and historical claims 
data across multiple evidence streams. 
The panel will make recommendations 
to VA leadership regarding whether the 
evidence supports conducting a formal 
evaluation. The panel will not make any 
recommendations regarding future 
studies, as that is outside of the scope 
of the scientific assessment. 
This current assessment will focus on 
kidney cancer because it is the disability 
identified in the NASEM report as 
having the strongest evidence linking it 
to PFAS exposure. The other outcomes 
categorized as having ‘‘sufficient 
evidence of an association’’ were either 
clinical indicators (not disabilities) or 
were conditions that occur in children. 
VA only has the authority to create 
presumptions for disabilities in 
veterans; policies related to care/ 
compensation for children would 
require Congressional mandate and 
appropriations. Other disabilities, such 
as those included in other categories 
identified by NASEM, may be assessed 
in future assessments as additional data 
becomes available. VA remains 
committed to transparency, scientific 
integrity, and supporting the health of 
all veterans affected by PFAS and other 
military environmental exposures. 
VA agrees that it is important to 
ensure that the scientific assessment 
includes PFAS compounds and 
exposure routes specific to military 
settings, such as those involving fire- 
fighting foams or aqueous film-forming 
foam used to extinguish jet fuel in 
military and commercial settings. The 
assessment will examine all peer- 
reviewed studies involving relevant 
PFAS compounds, including those with 
known military applications. The 
Department of War is still in the process 
of identifying all of its uses of PFAS; 
therefore, not all potential exposure 
routes related to military service are 
known. To ensure that the assessment 
allows for as broad of a review on the 
potential relationship between PFAS 
and kidney cancer as possible, any 
published data on this relationship in 
any population will be considered. 
Regarding potential exposures at Fort 
McClellan, Alabama, section 801 of the 
PACT Act required a Congressionally 
mandated epidemiological study to 
conduct analyses of morbidity and 
mortality vis-a`-vis veterans who served 
at this location between January 1, 1935, 
and May 20, 1999. VA is currently 
conducting this research and will 
disseminate the results upon 
completion. 
VA does not currently offer PFAS 
blood testing. This is because PFAS 
blood tests have limited clinical value 
in that they can detect levels of certain 
PFAS in an individual’s body at one 
point in time, but they cannot be used 
to determine when an individual was 
exposed, the source of exposure, or 
whether it could affect an individual’s 
health now or in the future. These tests 
also do not guide treatment decisions. 
Veterans who are still interested in 
testing may choose to do so through 
private laboratories outside the VA 
health care system. If an individual has 
concerns about PFAS exposure, they 
can speak with their primary care 
provider, who can review the 
individual’s health history and 
determine if additional evaluations are 
needed. 
VA does not plan to create a PFAS 
registry, since self-reported registries 
have limited scientific value. Instead, 
VA is conducting epidemiologic studies 
to try to improve our understanding of 
the impact of PFAS exposures in 
military populations. Further, under the 
PACT Act, VA is conducting a review of 
the current evidence linking PFAS 
exposure to kidney cancer as the first 
step in the presumptive decision 
process. Additional conditions may be 
considered in future phases of review. 
The findings of this and all presumptive 
decision process reviews will be shared 
in the Federal Register. 
VA cannot comment on veteran 
medical histories or claims shared 
through the public comment process. 
VA encourages all veterans who feel 
their military service has negatively 
impacted their health to submit a claim 
for disability compensation. VA will 
review the claims on a case-by-case 
basis. Veterans who have evidence of an 
in-service toxic exposure and developed 
a non-presumptive disability related to 
that exposure may be entitled to receive 
compensation benefits under the direct 
service connection provisions if a 
medical opinion provides a causal link 
between the two. VA is unable to grant 
benefits if a link between the veteran’s 
medical conditions and military service 
is not found. When determining 
eligibility for benefits, VA considers all 
avenues of service connection, which 
includes direct service connection, 
secondary service connection, and 
presumptive service connection. Service 
connection is not limited to potential 
exposures and may be warranted for 
chronic conditions manifesting to a 
compensable degree within the 
recognized time. If a claimant disagrees 
with a claim decision, they can choose 
from the following decision review 
options: Supplemental Claim, Higher- 
Level Review, or Board Appeal, to 
continue their case. Visit www.va.gov or call (800) MYVA411 to learn about the 
options available. 
Moving Forward 
VA will provide status updates on the 
scientific assessment at the PACT Act 
Quarterly Briefing for VSOs and 
stakeholders. Additionally, VA will 
publish the annual notice for fiscal year 
(FY) 2025 as required by 38 U.S.C. 1172. 
The FY 2025 notice will announce plans 
and details for the annual listening 
session. The quarterly briefings, annual 
notice, and listening session will 
provide the opportunity for veterans, 
family members, VSOs, stakeholders, 
and the public to provide their input.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
The MMPA prohibits the ‘‘take’’ of 
marine mammals, with certain 
exceptions. Section 101(a)(5)(A) and (D) 
of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) 
directs the Secretary of Commerce (as 
delegated to NMFS) to allow, upon 
request, the incidental, but not 
intentional, taking of small numbers of 
marine mammals by U.S. citizens who 
engage in a specified activity (other than 
commercial fishing) within a specified 
geographical region if certain findings 
are made and either regulations are 
proposed or, if the taking is limited to 
harassment, a notice of a proposed IHA 
is provided to the public for review. 
Authorization for incidental takings 
shall be granted if NMFS finds that the 
taking will have a negligible impact on 
the species or stock(s) and will not have 
an unmitigable adverse impact on the 
availability of the species or stock(s) for 
taking for subsistence uses (where 
relevant). Further, NMFS must prescribe 
the permissible methods of taking; other 
‘‘means of effecting the least practicable 
adverse impact’’ on the affected species 
or stocks and their habitat, paying 
particular attention to rookeries, mating 
grounds, and areas of similar 
significance, and on the availability of 
the species or stocks for taking for 
certain subsistence uses (referred to as 
‘‘mitigation’’); and requirements 
pertaining to the monitoring and 
reporting of the takings. The definitions 
of all applicable MMPA statutory terms 
used above are included in the relevant 
sections below (see also 16 U.S.C. 1362; 
50 C.F.R 216.3, 216.103). 
National Environmental Policy Act 
To comply with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(NEPA; 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and 
NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 
216–6A, NMFS must review our 
proposed action (i.e., the issuance of an IHA) with respect to potential impacts 
on the human environment. 
This action is consistent with 
categories of activities identified in 
Categorical Exclusion B4 (IHAs with no 
anticipated serious injury or mortality) 
of the Companion Manual for NAO 216– 
6A, which do not individually or 
cumulatively have the potential for 
significant impacts on the quality of the 
human environment and for which we 
have not identified any extraordinary 
circumstances that would preclude this 
categorical exclusion. Accordingly, 
NMFS has preliminarily determined 
that the issuance of the proposed IHA 
qualifies to be categorically excluded 
from further NEPA review. 
Summary of Request 
On June 16, 2025, NMFS received a 
request from L–DEO for an IHA to take 
marine mammals incidental to a marine 
geophysical survey of the East Pacific 
Rise in the ETP. After review of the 
application and confirming details with 
the applicant, the application was 
deemed adequate and complete on 
September 10, 2025. L–DEO’s request is 
for take of 28 species of marine 
mammals, by Level B harassment only. 
Neither L–DEO nor NMFS expect 
serious injury or mortality to result from 
this activity and, therefore, an IHA is 
appropriate. 
Description of Proposed Activity 
Overview 
Researchers from the University of 
California, San Diego, and Woods Hole 
Oceanographic Institution, with funding 
from the National Science Foundation 
(NSF), and in collaboration with the 
Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, 
propose to conduct a three-dimensional 
(3–D) seismic survey, using airguns as 
the acoustic source, from the research 
vessel (R/V) Marcus G. Langseth 
(Langseth), which is owned and 
operated by L–DEO. The proposed 
survey would occur off Western Mexico 
in the ETP from approximately February 
2026 to March 2026. The proposed 
survey would occur within international 
waters, in water depths ranging from 
approximately 2,500 to 3,200 meters 
(m). To complete this 3–D survey, the 
Langseth would tow 2 18-airgun arrays with a total discharge volume of 
approximately 3,300 cubic inch (in
3
) 
(54,077 cubic centimeters (cc)) each, at 
a depth of 7.5 m. The airgun array 
receiver would consist of four 5,850 m 
long solid-state hydrophone streamer. 
The airguns would fire at a shot interval 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  21:00 Dec 17, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\18DEN2.SGM 18DEN2
lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259331 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices of 37.5 m. Approximately 3,110 
kilometers (km) of seismic acquisition is 
planned. Airgun arrays would introduce 
underwater sound that may result in 
take of marine mammals. 
The purpose of the proposed survey is 
to obtain information that would be 
used to address the evolution of fast- 
spreading mid-ocean ridge magmatic 
systems and volcanic cycles at the East 
Pacific Rise in the ETP. The main goal 
of the proposed seismic surveys is to 
collect 3–D multi-channel seismic 
(MCS) reflection data in the ETP, 
repeating the same experiment 
conducted in 2008 on board Langseth. 
The two datasets would be processed 
together, in order to obtain high- 
resolution imagery that would be used 
to investigate how the magmatic and 
hydrothermal plumbing systems 
beneath this submarine volcanic ridge 
have changed since 2008, thereby 
allowing for a unique four-dimensional 
(4–D) time-lapse study. The time-lapse 
imagery would allow scientists to test 
long-debated hypotheses about the 
eruption cycle for the first time, by 
distinguishing characteristic changes in 
the shape and melt content of the 
magmatic system. 
Dates and Duration 
The proposed IHA would be valid for 
the statutory maximum of 1 year from 
the date of effectiveness. It will become 
effective upon written notification from 
the applicant to NMFS, but not 
beginning later than 1 year from the date 
of issuance or extending beyond 2 years 
from the date of issuance. The expected 
timing of the survey is February through 
March 2026, lasting 35 days, which 
includes approximately 20 days of 
seismic operations, 3.5 days of Ocean 
Bottom Seismometers deployment, 4 
days of equipment deployment/ 
recovery, 6 days contingency, and 5 
days of transit. 
Specific Geographic Region 
The proposed survey would occur 
within approximately 10.2° N lat., 104.5° W long.; 10.2° N lat., 104.1° W long.; 8.3° N lat., 104.1° W long.; and 8.3° N lat., 104.5° W long., off the Pacific coast of Mexico in international 
waters, in water depths ranging from 
approximately 2,500 to 3,200 m. The 
region where the survey is proposed to 
occur is depicted in figure 1. 
Representative survey tracklines are 
shown; however, some deviation in 
actual tracklines, including the order of 
survey operations, could be necessary 
for reasons such as science drivers, poor 
data quality, inclement weather, or 
mechanical issues with the research 
vessel and/or equipment. Therefore, for 
the proposed survey, the tracklines 
could occur anywhere within the 
coordinates noted above. The Langseth 
would likely leave out of and return to 
port in Manzanilla, Mexico 
(approximately 1,000 km north of the 
survey area).

Activity 
The procedures to be used for the 
proposed survey would be similar to 
those used during previous seismic 
surveys conducted by L–DEO and 
would use conventional seismic 
methodology. The survey would involve 
one source vessel, Langseth, which is owned and operated by L–DEO. During 
the 3–D seismic survey, Langseth would tow 4 strings (each 16 m long) with 36 
airguns (plus 4 spares); however, only 
18 airguns in 2 strings would be firing 
at 1 time. During the surveys, the 2 18- 
airgun arrays would fire in an alternate 
‘‘flip-flop’’ mode every 37.5 m (16 
seconds (s)). The total discharge volume 
would be 3300 in
3
, and the array would 
be towed at a depth of 7.5 m. The 2 
strings in each 18-airgun array would be 
separated by 8 m, and the two ‘‘flip- 
flop’’ arrays would be spaced 75 m 
apart. The airgun strings would be 
towed 265 m behind the Langseth. The airgun arrays consist of a mixture 
of Bolt 1500LL and Bolt 1900LLX 
airguns. The airgun array configurations 
are illustrated in figure 2–11 of NSF and 
the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) 
Programmatic Environmental Impact 
Statement (PEIS; NSF–USGS, 2011). The 
PEIS is available online at: https://
www.nsf.gov/geo/oce/envcomp/usgs- 
nsf-marine-seismic-research/nsf-usgs- 
final-eis-oeis_3june2011.pdf. The main receiving system would consist of four 
5,850 m long solid-state hydrophone 
streamers, separated by 150 m (solid 
flexible polymer—neither gel nor oil 
filled). As the airgun arrays are towed 
along the survey lines, the hydrophone 
streamers will receive the returning 
acoustic signals and transfer the data to 
the on-board processing system. 
The 3–D survey would be acquired in 
a racetrack formation, a pattern whereby 
the next acquisition line is several 
kilometers away from and traversed in 
the opposite direction of the trackline 
just completed. The 3–D surveys would 
consist of 2 racetracks; one with 49 
cross-axis transect lines and one with 40 
cross-axis transect lines. There would be 
a total of 89 lines, spaced 300 m apart. 
Each line would be 26 km long, for a 
total of 2,314 line km; however, with 
infill or repeat acquisition along some 
transects, the total for the racetrack 
survey is expected to be approximately 
2,900 km. Data would not be acquired 
during turns; thus, turns are not 
included in the total. In addition, one 
single long-axis transect, 210 km long, 
would also be acquired (figure 1). Thus, 
the total survey effort would consist of 
approximately 3,110 km of seismic 
acquisition. 
In addition to the operations of the 
airgun array, the ocean floor would be 
mapped with the Kongsberg EM 122 
multibeam echosounder (MBES) and a 
Knudsen Chirp 3260 sub bottom profiler 
(SBP). A Teledyne RDI 75 kilohertz 
(kHz) Ocean Surveyor acoustic doppler 
current profiler (ADCP) would be used 
to measure water current velocities. 
Take of marine mammals is not 
expected to occur incidental to use of 
the MBES, SBP, and ADCP operations 
whether or not the airguns are operating 
simultaneously with the other sources. 
Given their characteristics (e.g., narrow downward-directed beam), marine 
mammals would experience no more 
than one or two brief ping exposures, if 
any exposure were to occur (Ruppel et 
al., 2022). Proposed mitigation, monitoring, and 
reporting measures are described in 
detail later in this Notice (please see 
Proposed Mitigation and Proposed 
Monitoring and Reporting). 
Description of Marine Mammals in the 
Area of Specified Activities 
Sections 3 and 4 of the application 
summarize available information 
regarding status and trends, distribution 
and habitat preferences, and behavior 
and life history of the potentially 
affected species. NMFS fully considered 
all of this information, and we refer the 
reader to these descriptions, instead of 
reprinting the information. Additional 
information regarding population trends 
and threats may be found in NMFS’ 
Stock Assessment Reports (SARs; 
https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/ 
national/marine-mammal-protection/ 
marine-mammal-stock-assessments) 
and more general information about 
these species (e.g., physical and behavioral descriptions) may be found 
on NMFS’ website (https://
www.fisheries.noaa.gov/find-species). 
Most populations of marine mammals 
found in the survey area do not occur 
within the U.S. EEZ and therefore, are 
not assessed in NMFS’ Stock 
Assessment Reports (SARs). For these 
populations, NMFS is evaluating 
impacts at the population level and 
ranges are considered to be the Eastern 
Tropical Pacific. As such, information 
on potential biological removal level 
(PBR; defined by the MMPA as the 
maximum number of animals, not 
including natural mortalities, that may 
be removed from a marine mammal 
stock while allowing that stock to reach 
or maintain its optimum sustainable 
population) and annual levels of serious 
injury and mortality from anthropogenic 
sources are not available for these 
marine mammal populations. 
For marine mammal populations that 
occur within the U.S. EEZ and are 
assessed in a SAR, table 1 summarizes 
information related to the population or 
stock, including regulatory status under 
the MMPA and Endangered Species Act 
(ESA) and potential biological removal 
(PBR), where known (as described in 
NMFS’ SARs). While no serious injury 
or mortality is anticipated or proposed 
to be authorized here, PBR and annual 
serious injury and mortality (M/SI) from 
anthropogenic sources are included here 
as gross indicators of the status of the 
species or stocks and other threats. All 
values presented in Table 1 for 
populations that are assessed in the 
SARs are the most recent available at 
the time of publication and are available 
in the draft 2024 SARs (available online 
at: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/ national/marine-mammal-protection/ 
draft-marine-mammal-stock- 
assessment-reports). 
Abundance estimates for marine 
mammals in the survey location are 
based on a variety of sources, including 
Gerrodette et al., 2008, Wade and Gerrodette 1993 and Gerrodette and 
Forcada 2002. The modeled abundance 
is considered the best scientific 
information available on the abundance 
of marine mammal populations in the 
survey area.

ESA status: Endangered (E), Threatened (T)/MMPA status: Depleted (D). A dash (-) indicates that the species is not listed under the ESA or designated as de-
pleted under the MMPA. Under the MMPA, a strategic stock is one for which the level of direct human-caused mortality exceeds PBR or which is determined to be 
declining and likely to be listed under the ESA within the foreseeable future. Any species or stock listed under the ESA is automatically designated under the MMPA 
as depleted and as a strategic stock.

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259334 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices As indicated above, all 28 species in 
table 1 temporally and spatially co- 
occur with the activity to the degree that 
take could occur. Although the ETP 
abundance for Sei whale is zero, they 
were sighted in a previous seismic 
survey in the ETP and therefore, could 
occur in or nearby the action area. 
Some species could occur in the 
proposed survey area but are not likely 
to be encountered due to the rarity of 
their occurrence. These species are the 
North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena 
japonica), gray whale (Eschrichtius 
robustus), Hubbs’ beaked whale 
(Mesoplodon carlhubbsi), Stejneger’s 
beaked whale (M. stejnegeri), Perrin’s 
beaked whale (M. perrini), Baird’s 
beaked whale (Berardius bairdii), harbor 
porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), Dall’s 
porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli), Pacific 
white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus 
obliquidens), and northern right whale 
dolphin (Lissodelphis borealis), which 
all generally occur well outside or north 
of the proposed survey area (e.g., north of the Baja peninsula). Although there 
are seven species of pinnipeds known to 
occur in the ETP including the 
California sea lion (Zalophus 
californianus californianus), Gala´pagos 
sea lion (Zalophus wollebaeki), 
Gala´pagos fur seal (Arctocephalus 
galapagoensis), Guadalupe fur seal 
(Arctocephalus townsendi), South 
American fur seal (A. australis), South 
American sea lion (Otaria flavescens), 
and northern elephant seal (Mirounga 
angustirostris), pinnipeds are not likely 
to be encountered during the proposed 
seismic surveys. Neither Jackson et al. 
(2004), Smultea and Holst (2003), nor 
Hauser et al. (2008) encountered any pinnipeds in offshore waters near the 
proposed study area. 
In addition to what is included in 
sections 3 and 4 of the IHA application, 
and NMFS’ website, further detail 
informing the regional occurrence for 
select species of particular or unique 
vulnerability (i.e., information regarding ESA listed or MMPA depleted species) 
is provided below. 
Humpback Whale 
The Central America distinct 
population segment (DPS) equates to the 
Central America/Southern Mexico-CA/ 
OR/WA stock designated under the 
MMPA and shown in table 1. The 
endangered Central America DPS may 
occur within the proposed survey area, 
based on the timing of the proposed 
survey (February–March). Humpbacks 
from the Central America DPS could be 
migrating through the survey area at the 
time of the proposed survey. 
Whales in the Central America/ 
Southern Mexico-CA/OR/WA stock 
winter off the coasts of Nicaragua, 
Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Panama, Costa Rica, and southern 
Mexico including the states of Oaxaca 
and Guerrero, with some animals 
ranging even farther north (Taylor et al., 
2021); they summer off California, 
Oregon, and Washington (Calambokidis 
et al., 2000). 
Nine sightings were made during 
surveys off the Pacific coast of Mexico 
in November 2019 (Oedekoven et al., 
2021). The central coast of Oaxaca is 
thought to be a migratory corridor 
during winter, with whales typically 
migrating up to 4 km from shore (Heckel 
et al., 2020). In 2012, 45 sightings were 
made off Oaxaca (Castillejos-Moguel 
and Villegas-Zurita 2014 in Heckel et 
al., 2020) including feeding behavior (Villegas-Zurita and Castillejos-Moguel 
2013 in Heckel et al., 2020). Feeding has 
also been observed in Banderas Bay, 
which is known to be an aggregation 
area for humpbacks during the winter 
months (Frish-Jorda´n et al., 2019). One sighting was made during an L–DEO 
survey off Guerrero and Michoaca´n in 
May–June 2022 (RPS 2022). Although 
sightings are regularly made within the 
region during winter, sightings during 
the proposed spring survey in deep 
offshore waters are likely to be less 
common. 
Although there are other stocks of 
humpback whales found in Mexico near 
the project area, it’s likely that 
humpbacks from the Mexico DPS 
(Mexico-North Pacific Stock and 
Mainland Mexico-CA/OR/WA Stock) 
are not found in the survey area. The 
Mexico DPS’s winter breeding grounds 
are north of the proposed survey area in 
the Revillagigedos Islands. Therefore, 
we assume that all humpback whales 
that may be taken by the proposed 
survey activities would be from the 
Central America/Southern Mexico-CA/ 
OR/WA stock. 
Sei Whale 
Sei whales are less common in the 
survey area but there have been some 
reports as summarized below. Sei 
whales are known to occasionally occur 
in the Gulf of California (Urba´n et al., 2014 in Heckel et al., 2020), as well as 
off the west coast of the Baja California 
Peninsula (Heckel et al., 2020). One 
sighting has been reported for waters off 
Nayarit (Urba´n et al., 1997, Guerrero et al., 2006 in Heckel et al., 2020), and another sighting was made near the 
northern part of the proposed survey 
area, off Jalisco (Heckel et al., 2020). 
Gonza´lez et al. (2008) also reported the presence of sei whales off west coast of 
Mexico south of 23° N lat. However, neither Ferguson and Barlow (2001) nor 
Jackson et al. (2004) positively identified any sei whales in Mexican 
waters during surveys conducted during 
July–December. RPS (2022) reported 
two sightings of single sei whales during 
an L–DEO survey off Guerrero and 
Michoaca´n in May–June 2022. 
Fin Whale 
Fin whale calls are recorded in the 
North Pacific year-round (e.g., Moore et al., 2006; Stafford et al., 2007, 2009; Edwards et al., 2015). However, fin whales are considered rare in the 
proposed survey area. No sightings were 
made in the proposed survey area 
during July–December surveys during 
1986–1996, 2003, or 2019 (Ferguson and 
Barlow 2001; Jackson et al., 2004; 
Oedekoven et al., 2021). Similarly, Edwards et al., (2015) reported no sightings or acoustic detections for the 
proposed survey area, although 
sightings have been reported for the 
Gulf of California and a few sightings 
exist for offshore waters far west of 
Mexico. However, Gonza´lez et al. (2008) reported the presence of this species off 
the west coast of Mexico south of 23° N lat., and a sighting has been reported for 
Banderas Bay (Arroyo 2017). RPS (2022) 
reported one fin whale sighting during 
an L–DEO survey off Guerrero and 
Michoaca´n in May–June 2022. 
Blue Whale 
In the Northeast Pacific Ocean, 
including the ETP, blue whale calls are 
detected year-round (Stafford et al., 
1999, 2001, 2009; Monnahan et al., 
2014). In the ETP, blue whales have 
been sighted mainly off the Baja 
California Peninsula, near Costa Rica, at 
and near the Gala´pagos Islands, and 
along the coasts of Ecuador and 
northern Peru (Clarke 1980; Donovan 
1984; Reilly and Thayer 1990; Mate et 
al., 1999; Palacios 1999; Palacios et al., 2005; Branch et al., 2006). Sightings 
have also been made off the mainland 
coast of Mexico (Fiedler 2002; Arroyo 
2017). In Mexican waters, blue whales 
generally occur from December to April 
(Rice 1974; Yochem and Leatherwood 
1985; Gendron 2002 in Heckel et al., 
2020), after which time they migrate 
northward; a large proportion occurs off 
California during the summer (Sears and 
Perrin 2018). 
During surveys within the EEZ of 
Pacific Mexico, 30 sightings of blue 
whales were reported by Gerrodette and 
Palacios (1996). The density of blue 
whales in the proposed study area was 
zero based on July–December surveys 
during 1986–1996 (Ferguson and 
Barlow 2001). However, sightings have 
been made just east of the proposed

Jackson et al., 2004; Forney et al., 2012). Sperm Whale 
During summer and fall, sperm 
whales are widely distributed in the 
ETP, although they are generally more 
abundant in deeper ‘‘nearshore’’ waters 
than far offshore (e.g., Polacheck 1987; Wade and Gerrodette 1993). More than 
180 sightings have been reported for the 
ETP, with the highest concentrations at 
10° N lat.–10° S lat., 80°–100° W long. (Guerrero et al., 2006). Sightings for Pacific Mexico include records off the 
Baja California Peninsula and in the 
Gulf of California (Guerrero et al., 2006; 
Heckel et al., 2020). During 25,356 km of surveys (excluding the Gulf of 
California) within the EEZ of Pacific 
Mexico, during July–December 1986– 
1990, 1992 and 1993, 46 sightings of 
sperm whales were made (Gerrodette 
and Palacios 1996). No sightings were 
made along the mainland coast of 
Mexico during July–December surveys 
in 2003, although one sighting was 
made off the west coast of Baja 
California Sur (Jackson et al., 2004). 
Records also exist for Banderas Bay 
(Arroyo 2017) and Oaxaca (Pe´rez and 
Gordillo 2002 in Heckel et al., 2020). 
Pantropical Spotted Dolphin 
The pantropical spotted dolphin is 
one of the most abundant cetaceans and 
is distributed worldwide in tropical and 
some subtropical waters, between 40° 
N and 40° S lat. (Jefferson et al., 2015). In the ETP, this species ranges from 25° 
N lat. off the Baja California Peninsula 
to 17° S lat., off southern Peru (Perrin and Hohn 1994). There are two forms of 
pantropical spotted dolphin (Perrin 
2018a): Coastal (Stenella attenuata 
graffmani) and offshore (S. a. 
attenuata), both of which could occur 
within the proposed survey area. Along 
the coast of Latin America, the coastal 
form typically occurs within 20 km from 
shore (Urba´n 2008 in Heckel et al., 
2020). There are currently three 
recognized stocks of spotted dolphins in 
the ETP: the coastal stock and two 
offshore stocks—the northeast and the 
west/south stocks (Wade and Gerrodette 
1993; Leslie et al., 2019). Much of what 
is known about the pantropical spotted 
dolphin in the ETP is related to the 
historical tuna purse-seine fishery in 
that area (Perrin and Hohn 1994). There 
was an overall stock decline of spotted 
dolphins from 1960 to 1980 because of 
the fishery (Allen 1985). In 1979, the 
population size of spotted dolphins in 
the ETP was estimated at 2.9–3.3 
million (Allen 1985). For 1986–1990, 
Wade and Gerrodette (1993) reported an 
estimate of 2.1 million. Gerrodette and 
Forcada (2005) noted that the 
population of offshore northeastern 
spotted dolphins had not yet recovered 
from the earlier population declines; 
possible reasons for the lack of growth 
were attributed to unreported bycatch, 
effects of fishing activity on survival 
and reproduction, and long-term 
changes in the ecosystem. The 
abundance estimate for 2006 was 
857,884 northeastern offshore spotted 
dolphins, and 439,208 western-southern 
offshore spotted dolphins; the coastal 
subspecies was estimated at 278,155 
and was less affected by fishing 
activities (Gerrodette et al., 2008). In 
2004, the mortality rate in the tuna 
fishery was estimated at 0.03 percent 
(Bayliff 2004). Perrin (2018a) noted that 
for the last few years, hundreds of 
spotted dolphins have been taken in the 
fishery. Currently, there are 640,000 
northeastern offshore spotted dolphins 
inhabiting the ETP (Perrin 2018a). This 
stock is designated as depleted under 
the MMPA and may be slow to recover 
due to continued chase and 
encirclement by the tuna fishery, which 
may in turn affect reproductive rates 
(Cramer et al., 2008; Kellar et al., 2013). The northeastern offshore and coastal 
stocks of pantropical spotted dolphins 
are likely to be encountered during the 
proposed surveys. 
Spinner Dolphin 
The spinner dolphin is pantropical in 
distribution, including oceanic tropical 
and sub-tropical waters between 40° N and 40° S lat. (Jefferson et al., 2015). It is generally considered a pelagic 
species, but it can also be found in 
coastal waters (Perrin 2018b). In the 
ETP, three types of spinner dolphins 
have been identified and two of those 
are recognized as subspecies: The 
eastern spinner dolphin (Stenella 
longirostris orientalis), considered an 
offshore species, the Central American 
spinner (S. l. centroamericana; also 
known as the Costa Rican spinner), 
considered a coastal species occurring 
from southern Mexico to Costa Rica 
(Perrin 1990; Dizon et al., 1991), and the 
‘whitebelly’ spinner which is thought to 
be a hybrid of the eastern spinner and 
Gray’s spinner (S. l. longirostris). Gray’s 
spinner dolphin is not expected to occur 
within the proposed study area. 
Although there is a great deal of overlap 
between the ranges of eastern and 
whitebelly spinner dolphins, the eastern 
form generally occurs in the 
northeastern portion of the ETP, 
whereas the whitebelly spinner occurs 
in the southern portion of the ETP, 
ranging farther offshore (Wade and 
Gerrodette 1993; Reilly and Fiedler 
1994). Reilly and Fiedler (1994) noted 
that eastern spinners are associated with 
waters that have high surface 
temperatures and chlorophyll and 
shallow thermoclines, whereas 
whitebelly spinners are associated with 
cooler surface temperatures, lower 
chlorophyll levels, and deeper 
thermoclines. The eastern spinner 
dolphins are the most likely to occur in 
the proposed survey area (see Ferguson 
and Barlow 2001; Heckel et al., 2020), 
as this subspecies occurs in the ETP, 
east of 145° W lat., between 24° N off the Baja California Peninsula and 10° S off Peru (Perrin 1990). Wade and 
Gerrodette (1993) reported an 
abundance estimate of 1.7 million, and 
Gerrodette et al. (2005) estimated the abundance at 1.1 million for 2003. 
Gerrodette and Forcada (2005) noted 
that the population of eastern spinner 
dolphins had not yet recovered from the 
earlier population declines due to the 
tuna fishery. The population estimate 
for eastern spinner dolphins in 2003 
was 612,662 (Gerrodette et al., 2005). In 
2000, the whitebelly dolphin was 
estimated to number 801,000 in the ETP 
(Gerrodette et al., 2005). Bayliff (2004) noted a spinner dolphin mortality rate 
in the tuna fishery of 0.03 percent for 
2004. At the time, possible reasons why 
the population had not recovered 
include under-reported bycatch, effects 
of fishing activity on survival and 
reproduction, and long-term changes in 
the ecosystem (Gerrodette and Forcada, 
2005). 
Marine Mammal Hearing 
Hearing is the most important sensory 
modality for marine mammals 
underwater, and exposure to 
anthropogenic sound can have 
deleterious effects. To appropriately 
assess the potential effects of exposure 
to sound, it is necessary to understand 
the frequency ranges marine mammals 
are able to hear. Not all marine mammal 
species have equal hearing capabilities 
(e.g., Richardson et al., 1995; Wartzok and Ketten, 1999; Au and Hastings, 
2008). To reflect this, Southall et al. 
(2007, 2019) recommended that marine 
mammals be divided into hearing 
groups based on directly measured 
(behavioral or auditory evoked potential 
techniques) or estimated hearing ranges 
(behavioral response data, anatomical 
modeling, etc.). Generalized hearing ranges were chosen based on 
approximately 65 decibel (dB) threshold 
from composite audiograms, previous 
analyses in NMFS (2018), and/or data 
from Southall et al. (2007) and Southall 
et al. (2019). We note that the names of 
two hearing groups and the generalized 
hearing ranges of all marine mammal 
hearing groups have been recently

Potential Effects of Specified Activities 
on Marine Mammals and Their Habitat 
This section provides a discussion of 
the ways in which components of the 
specified activity may impact marine 
mammals and their habitat. The 
Estimated Take of Marine Mammals 
section later in this document includes 
a quantitative analysis of the number of 
individuals that are expected to be taken 
by this activity. The Negligible Impact 
Analysis and Determination section 
considers the content of this section, the 
Estimated Take of Marine Mammals 
section, and the Proposed Mitigation 
section, to draw conclusions regarding 
the likely impacts of these activities on 
the reproductive success or survivorship 
of individuals and whether those 
impacts are reasonably expected to, or 
reasonably likely to, adversely affect the 
species or stock through effects on 
annual rates of recruitment or survival. 
Description of Active Acoustic Sound 
Sources 
This section contains a brief technical 
background on sound, the 
characteristics of certain sound types, 
and on metrics used in this proposal 
inasmuch as the information is relevant 
to the specified activity and to a 
discussion of the potential effects of the 
specified activity on marine mammals 
found later in this document. 
Sound travels in waves, the basic 
components of which are frequency, 
wavelength, velocity, and amplitude. 
Frequency is the number of pressure 
waves that pass by a reference point per 
unit of time and is measured in hertz 
(Hz) or cycles per second. Wavelength is 
the distance between two peaks or 
corresponding points of a sound wave 
(length of one cycle). Higher frequency 
sounds have shorter wavelengths than 
lower frequency sounds, and typically 
attenuate (decrease) more rapidly, 
except in certain cases in shallower 
water. Amplitude is the height of the 
sound pressure wave or the ‘‘loudness’’ 
of a sound and is typically described 
using the relative unit of the dB. A 
sound pressure level (SPL) in dB is 
described as the ratio between a 
measured pressure and a reference 
pressure (for underwater sound, this is 
1 micropascal (mPa)) and is a 
logarithmic unit that accounts for large 
variations in amplitude; therefore, a 
relatively small change in dB 
corresponds to large changes in sound 
pressure. The source level (SL) 
represents the SPL referenced at a 
distance of 1 m from the source 
(referenced to 1 mPa) while the received 
level is the SPL at the listener’s position 
(referenced to 1 mPa). 
Root mean square (RMS) is the 
quadratic mean sound pressure over the 
duration of an impulse. Root mean 
square is calculated by squaring all of 
the sound amplitudes, averaging the 
squares, and then taking the square root 
of the average (Urick, 1983). Root mean 
square accounts for both positive and 
negative values; squaring the pressures 
makes all values positive so that they 
may be accounted for in the summation 
of pressure levels (Hastings and Popper, 
2005). This measurement is often used 
in the context of discussing behavioral 
effects, in part because behavioral 
effects, which often result from auditory 
cues, may be better expressed through 
averaged units than by peak pressures. 
Sound exposure level (SEL; 
represented as dB re 1 mPa
2
–s) 
represents the total energy contained 
within a pulse and considers both 
intensity and duration of exposure. Peak 
sound pressure (also referred to as zero- 
to-peak sound pressure or 0-p) is the 
maximum instantaneous sound pressure 
measurable in the water at a specified 
distance from the source and is 
represented in the same units as the 
RMS sound pressure. Another common 
metric is peak-to-peak sound pressure 
(pk-pk), which is the algebraic 
difference between the peak positive 
and peak negative sound pressures. 
Peak-to-peak pressure is typically 
approximately 6 dB higher than peak 
pressure (Southall et al., 2007). 
When underwater objects vibrate or 
activity occurs, sound-pressure waves 
are created. These waves alternately 
compress and decompress the water as 
the sound wave travels. Underwater 
sound waves radiate in a manner similar 
to ripples on the surface of a pond and 
may be either directed in a beam or 
beams or may radiate in all directions 
(omnidirectional sources), as is the case 
for pulses produced by the airgun array 
considered here. The compressions and 
decompressions associated with sound 
waves are detected as changes in 
pressure by aquatic life and man-made 
sound receptors such as hydrophones. 
Even in the absence of sound from the 
specified activity, the underwater 
environment is typically loud due to 
ambient sound. Ambient sound is 
defined as environmental background 
sound levels lacking a single source or 
point (Richardson et al., 1995), and the 
sound level of a region is defined by the 
total acoustical energy being generated 
by known and unknown sources. These 
sources may include physical (e.g., 
wind and waves, earthquakes, ice, 
atmospheric sound), biological (e.g., 
sounds produced by marine mammals, 
fish, and invertebrates), and 
anthropogenic (e.g., vessels, dredging, construction) sound. A number of 
sources contribute to ambient sound, 
including the following (Richardson et 
al., 1995): VerDate Sep<11>2014  21:00 Dec 17, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\18DEN2.SGM 18DEN2

Please refer to the information given previously 
(Description of Active Acoustic Sound Sources) 
regarding sound, characteristics of sound types, and 
metrics used in this document. 
Wind and waves—The complex 
interactions between wind and water 
surface, including processes such as 
breaking waves and wave-induced 
bubble oscillations and cavitation, are a 
main source of naturally occurring 
ambient sound for frequencies between 
200 Hz and 50 kHz (Mitson, 1995). In 
general, ambient sound levels tend to 
increase with increasing wind speed 
and wave height. Surf sound becomes 
important near shore, with 
measurements collected at a distance of 
8.5 km from shore showing an increase 
of 10 dB in the 100 to 700 Hz band 
during heavy surf conditions; 
Precipitation—Sound from rain and 
hail impacting the water surface can 
become an important component of total 
sound at frequencies above 500 Hz, and 
possibly down to 100 Hz during quiet 
times; 
Biological—Marine mammals can 
contribute significantly to ambient 
sound levels, as can some fish and 
snapping shrimp. The frequency band 
for biological contributions is from 
approximately 12 Hz to over 100 kHz; 
and 
Anthropogenic—Sources of 
anthropogenic sound related to human 
activity include transportation (surface 
vessels), dredging and construction, oil 
and gas drilling and production, seismic 
surveys, sonar, explosions, and ocean 
acoustic studies. Vessel noise typically 
dominates the total ambient sound for 
frequencies between 20 and 300 Hz. In 
general, the frequencies of 
anthropogenic sounds are below 1 kHz 
and, if higher frequency sound levels 
are created, they attenuate rapidly. 
Sound from identifiable anthropogenic 
sources other than the activity of 
interest (e.g., a passing vessel) is sometimes termed background sound, as 
opposed to ambient sound. 
The sum of the various natural and 
anthropogenic sound sources at any 
given location and time—which 
comprise ‘‘ambient’’ or ‘‘background’’ 
sound—depends not only on the source 
levels (as determined by current 
weather conditions and levels of 
biological and human activity) but also 
on the ability of sound to propagate 
through the environment. In turn, sound 
propagation is dependent on the 
spatially and temporally varying 
properties of the water column and sea 
floor, and is frequency-dependent. As a 
result of this dependence on a large 
number of varying factors, ambient 
sound levels can be expected to vary 
widely over both coarse and fine spatial 
and temporal scales. Sound levels at a 
given frequency and location can vary 
by 10–20 dB from day to day 
(Richardson et al., 1995). The result is that, depending on the source type and 
its intensity, sound from a given activity 
may be a negligible addition to the local 
environment or could form a distinctive 
signal that may affect marine mammals. 
Details of source types are described in 
the following text. 
Sounds are often considered to fall 
into one of two general types: Pulsed 
and non-pulsed. The distinction 
between these two sound types is 
important because they have differing 
potential to cause physical effects, 
particularly with regard to hearing (e.g., 
NMFS, 2018; Ward, 1997 in Southall et 
al., 2007). Please see Southall et al. (2007) for an in-depth discussion of 
these concepts. 
Pulsed sound sources (e.g., airguns, explosions, gunshots, sonic booms, 
impact pile driving) produce signals 
that are brief (typically considered to be 
less than 1 s), broadband, atonal 
transients (American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI), 1986, 2005; 
Harris, 1998; National Institute for 
Occupational Health and Safety 
(NIOSH), 1998; International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO), 
2003) and occur either as isolated events 
or repeated in some succession. Pulsed 
sounds are all characterized by a 
relatively rapid rise from ambient 
pressure to a maximal pressure value 
followed by a rapid decay period that 
may include a period of diminishing, 
oscillating maximal and minimal 
pressures, and generally have an 
increased capacity to induce physical 
injury as compared with sounds that 
lack these features. 
Non-pulsed sounds can be tonal, 
narrowband, or broadband, brief or 
prolonged, and may be either 
continuous or non-continuous (ANSI, 
1995; NIOSH, 1998). Some of these non- 
pulsed sounds can be transient signals 
of short duration but without the 
essential properties of pulses (e.g., rapid rise time). Examples of non-pulsed 
sounds include those produced by 
vessels, aircraft, machinery operations 
such as drilling or dredging, vibratory 
pile driving, and active sonar systems 
(such as those used by the U.S. Navy). 
The duration of such sounds, as 
received at a distance, can be greatly 
extended in a highly reverberant 
environment. 
Airgun arrays produce pulsed signals 
with energy in a frequency range from 
about 10 to 2,000 Hz, with most energy 
radiated at frequencies below 200 Hz. 
The amplitude of the acoustic wave 
emitted from the source is equal in all 
directions (i.e., omnidirectional), but airgun arrays do possess some 
directionality due to different phase 
delays between guns in different 
directions. Airgun arrays are typically 
tuned to maximize functionality for data 
acquisition purposes, meaning that 
sound transmitted in horizontal 
directions and at higher frequencies is 
minimized to the extent possible. 
Acoustic Effects 
Here, we discuss the effects of active 
acoustic sources on marine mammals. 
Potential Effects of Underwater 
Sound
1
—Anthropogenic sounds cover a 
broad range of frequencies and sound 
levels and can have a range of highly 
variable impacts on marine life, from 
none or minor to potentially severe 
responses, depending on received 
levels, duration of exposure, behavioral 
context, and various other factors. The 
potential effects of underwater sound 
from active acoustic sources can 
potentially result in one or more of the 
following: Temporary or permanent 
hearing impairment; non-auditory 
physical or physiological effects; 
behavioral disturbance; stress; and 
masking (Richardson et al., 1995; 
Gordon et al., 2004; Nowacek et al., 2007; Southall et al., 2007; Go¨tz et al., 2009). The degree of effect is 
intrinsically related to the signal 
characteristics, received level, distance 
from the source, and duration of the 
sound exposure. In general, sudden, 
high level sounds can cause hearing 
loss, as can longer exposures to lower 
level sounds. Temporary or permanent 
loss of hearing, if it occurs at all, will 
occur almost exclusively in cases where 
a noise is within an animal’s hearing 
frequency range. We first describe 
specific manifestations of acoustic 
effects before providing discussion 
specific to the use of airgun arrays. 
Richardson et al. (1995) described zones of increasing intensity of effect 
that might be expected to occur, in 
relation to distance from a source and 
assuming that the signal is within an 
animal’s hearing range. First is the area 
within which the acoustic signal would 
be audible (potentially perceived) to the 
animal, but not strong enough to elicit 
any overt behavioral or physiological 
response. The next zone corresponds 
with the area where the signal is audible 
to the animal and of sufficient intensity 
to elicit behavioral or physiological 
response. Third is a zone within which, 
for signals of high intensity, the 
received level is sufficient to potentially 
cause discomfort or tissue damage to 
auditory or other systems. Overlaying 
these zones to a certain extent is the

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259338 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices area within which masking (i.e., when a sound interferes with or masks the 
ability of an animal to detect a signal of 
interest that is above the absolute 
hearing threshold) may occur; the 
masking zone may be highly variable in 
size. 
We describe the more severe effects of 
certain non-auditory physical or 
physiological effects only briefly as we 
do not expect that use of airgun arrays 
are reasonably likely to result in such 
effects (see below for further 
discussion). Potential effects from 
impulsive sound sources can range in 
severity from effects such as behavioral 
disturbance or tactile perception to 
physical discomfort, slight injury of the 
internal organs and the auditory system, 
or mortality (Yelverton et al., 1973). 
Non-auditory physiological effects or 
injuries that theoretically might occur in 
marine mammals exposed to high level 
underwater sound or as a secondary 
effect of extreme behavioral reactions 
(e.g., change in dive profile as a result of an avoidance reaction) caused by 
exposure to sound include neurological 
effects, bubble formation, resonance 
effects, and other types of organ or 
tissue damage (Cox et al., 2006; Southall 
et al., 2007; Zimmer and Tyack, 2007; 
Tal et al., 2015). The survey activities considered here do not involve the use 
of devices such as explosives or mid- 
frequency tactical sonar that are 
associated with these types of effects. 
Marine mammals, like all mammals, 
develop increased hearing thresholds 
over time due to age-related 
degeneration of auditory pathways and 
sensory cells of the inner ear. This 
natural, age-related hearing loss is 
contrasted by noise-induced hearing 
loss (M<ller, 2012). Marine mammals 
exposed to high-intensity sound or to 
lower-intensity sound for prolonged 
periods can experience a noise-induced 
hearing threshold shift (TS), which 
NMFS defines as a change, usually an 
increase, in the threshold of audibility 
at a specified frequency or portion of an 
individual’s hearing range above a 
previously established reference level as 
a result of noise exposure (NMFS, 2018, 
2024). The amount of TS is customarily 
expressed in dB. Noise-induced hearing 
TS can be temporary (TTS) or 
permanent (PTS), and higher-level 
sound exposures are more likely to 
cause PTS or other Auditory Injury 
(AUD INJ). As described in NMFS 
(2018, 2024) there are numerous factors 
to consider when examining the 
consequence of TS, including, but not 
limited to, the signal temporal pattern 
(e.g., impulsive or non-impulsive), likelihood an individual would be 
exposed for a long enough duration or 
to a high enough level to induce a TS, 
the magnitude of the TS, time to 
recovery (seconds to minutes or hours to 
days), the frequency range of the 
exposure (i.e., spectral content), the hearing frequency range of the exposed 
species relative to the signal’s frequency 
spectrum (i.e., how animal uses sound within the frequency band of the signal; 
e.g., Kastelein et al., 2014), and the overlap between the animal and the 
source (e.g., spatial, temporal, and spectral). 
Auditory Injury (AUD INJ) 
NMFS (2024) defines AUD INJ as 
damage to the inner ear that can result 
in destruction of tissue, such as the loss 
of cochlear neuron synapses or auditory 
neuropathy (Houser 2021; Finneran 
2024). AUD INJ may or may not result 
in a PTS. PTS is subsequently defined 
as a permanent, irreversible increase in 
the threshold of audibility at a specified 
frequency or portion of an individual’s 
hearing range above a previously 
established reference level (NMFS, 
2024). PTS does not generally affect 
more than a limited frequency range, 
and an animal that has incurred PTS has 
some level of hearing loss at the relevant 
frequencies; typically animals with PTS 
or other AUD INJ are not functionally 
deaf (Au and Hastings, 2008; Finneran, 
2016). For marine mammals, AUD INJ is 
considered to be possible when sound 
exposures are sufficient to produce 40 
dB of TTS measured after exposure 
(Southall et al., 2007, 1019). AUD INJ levels for marine mammals are 
estimates, as with the exception of a 
single study unintentionally inducing 
PTS in a harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) 
(Kastak et al., 2008; Reichmuth et al., 2019), there are no empirical data 
measuring AUD INJ in marine mammals 
largely due to the fact that, for various 
ethical reasons, experiments involving 
anthropogenic noise exposure at levels 
inducing AUD INJ are not typically 
pursued or authorized (NMFS, 2024). 
Temporary Threshold Shift (TTS) 
TTS is the mildest form of hearing 
impairment that can occur during 
exposure to sound. TTS is a temporary, 
reversible increase in the threshold of 
audibility at a specified frequency or 
portion of an individual’s hearing range 
above a previously established reference 
level (NMFS, 2024) that represents 
primarily tissue fatigue (Henderson et 
al., 2008), and is not considered an AUD INJ. Based on data from marine mammal 
TTS measurements (see Southall et al., 
2007, 2019), a TTS of 6 dB is considered 
the minimum threshold shift clearly 
larger than any day-to-day or session-to- 
session variation in a subject’s normal 
hearing ability (Finneran et al., 2000, 
2002; Schlundt et al., 2000). While 
experiencing TTS, the hearing threshold 
rises, and a sound must be at a higher 
level in order to be heard. 
In terrestrial and marine mammals, 
TTS can last from minutes or hours to 
days (i.e., there is recovery back to baseline/pre-exposure levels), can occur 
within a specific frequency range (i.e., 
an animal might only have a temporary 
loss of hearing sensitivity within a 
limited frequency band of its auditory 
range), and can be of varying amounts 
(e.g., an animal’s hearing sensitivity might be reduced by only 6 dB or 
reduced by 30 dB). In many cases, 
hearing sensitivity recovers rapidly after 
exposure to the sound ends. While there 
are data on sound levels and durations 
necessary to elicit mild TTS for marine 
mammals, recovery is complicated to 
predict and dependent on multiple 
factors. 
Relationships between TTS and AUD 
INJ thresholds have not been studied in 
marine mammals, and there are no 
measured PTS data for cetaceans, but 
such relationships are assumed to be 
similar to those in humans and other 
terrestrial mammals. AUD INJ typically 
occurs at exposure levels at least several 
dB above that inducing mild TTS (e.g., 
a 40-dB threshold shift approximates 
AUD INJ onset (Kryter et al., 1966; 
Miller, 1974), while a 6-dB threshold 
shift approximates TTS onset (Southall 
et al., 2007, 2019). Based on data from 
terrestrial mammals, a precautionary 
assumption is that the AUD INJ 
thresholds for impulsive sounds (such 
as airgun pulses as received close to the 
source) are at least 6 dB higher than the 
TTS threshold on a peak sound pressure 
level (PK SPL) basis and AUD INJ 
cumulative SEL (SEL
24h
) thresholds are 
15 (impulsive sound criteria) to 20 dB 
(non-impulsive criteria) higher than 
TTS cumulative SEL thresholds 
(Southall et al., 2007, 2019). Given the higher level of sound or longer exposure 
duration necessary to cause AUD INJ as 
compared with TTS, it is considerably 
less likely that AUD INJ could occur. 
Marine mammal hearing plays a 
critical role in communication with 
conspecifics, and interpretation of 
environmental cues for purposes such 
as predator avoidance and prey capture. 
Depending on the degree (elevation of 
threshold in dB), duration (i.e., recovery time), and frequency range of TTS, and 
the context in which it is experienced, 
TTS can have effects on marine 
mammals ranging from discountable to 
serious. For example, a marine mammal 
may be able to readily compensate for 
a brief, relatively small amount of TTS 
in a non-critical frequency range that

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259339 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices occurs during a time where ambient 
noise is lower and there are not as many 
competing sounds present. 
Alternatively, a larger amount and 
longer duration of TTS sustained during 
time when communication is critical for 
successful mother/calf interactions 
could have more serious impacts. 
Finneran et al. (2015) measured hearing thresholds in 3 captive 
bottlenose dolphins before and after 
exposure to 10 pulses produced by a 
seismic airgun in order to study TTS 
induced after exposure to multiple 
pulses. Exposures began at relatively 
low levels and gradually increased over 
a period of several months, with the 
highest exposures at peak SPLs from 
196 to 210 dB and cumulative 
(unweighted) SELs from 193 to 195 dB. 
No substantial TTS was observed. In 
addition, behavioral reactions were 
observed that indicated that animals can 
learn behaviors that effectively mitigate 
noise exposures (although exposure 
patterns must be learned, which is less 
likely in wild animals than for the 
captive animals considered in this 
study). The authors note that the failure 
to induce more significant auditory 
effects was likely due to the intermittent 
nature of exposure, the relatively low 
peak pressure produced by the acoustic 
source, and the low-frequency energy in 
airgun pulses as compared with the 
frequency range of best sensitivity for 
dolphins and other high-frequency 
cetaceans. 
Currently, TTS data only exist for four 
species of cetaceans (bottlenose 
dolphin, beluga whale (Delphinapterus 
leucas), harbor porpoise, and Yangtze 
finless porpoise (Neophocaena 
asiaeorientalis)) exposed to a limited 
number of sound sources (i.e., mostly tones and octave-band noise) in 
laboratory settings (Finneran, 2015). In 
general, harbor porpoises have a lower 
TTS onset than other measured cetacean 
species (Finneran, 2015). Additionally, 
the existing marine mammal TTS data 
come from a limited number of 
individuals within these species. 
Critical questions remain regarding 
the rate of TTS growth and recovery 
after exposure to intermittent noise and 
the effects of single and multiple pulses. 
Data at present are also insufficient to 
construct generalized models for 
recovery and determine the time 
necessary to treat subsequent exposures 
as independent events. More 
information is needed on the 
relationship between auditory evoked 
potential and behavioral measures of 
TTS for various stimuli. For summaries 
of data on TTS in marine mammals or 
for further discussion of TTS onset 
thresholds, please see Southall et al. 
(2007, 2019), Finneran and Jenkins 
(2012), Finneran (2015), and NMFS 
(2018, 2024). 
Behavioral Effects—Behavioral 
disturbance may include a variety of 
effects, including subtle changes in 
behavior (e.g., minor or brief avoidance of an area or changes in vocalizations), 
more conspicuous changes in similar 
behavioral activities, and more 
sustained and/or potentially severe 
reactions, such as displacement from or 
abandonment of high-quality habitat. 
Behavioral responses to sound are 
highly variable and context-specific, 
and any reactions depend on numerous 
intrinsic and extrinsic factors (e.g., 
species, state of maturity, experience, 
current activity, reproductive state, 
auditory sensitivity, time of day), as 
well as the interplay between factors 
(e.g., Richardson et al., 1995; Wartzok et al., 2003; Southall et al., 2007, 2019; Weilgart, 2007; Archer et al., 2010). 
Behavioral reactions can vary not only 
among individuals but also within an 
individual, depending on previous 
experience with a sound source, 
context, and numerous other factors 
(Ellison et al., 2012), and can vary depending on characteristics associated 
with the sound source (e.g., whether it is moving or stationary, number of 
sources, distance from the source). 
Please see appendices B–C of Southall 
et al. (2007) for a review of studies 
involving marine mammal behavioral 
responses to sound. 
Habituation can occur when an 
animal’s response to a stimulus wanes 
with repeated exposure, usually in the 
absence of unpleasant associated events 
(Wartzok et al., 2003). Animals are most likely to habituate to sounds that are 
predictable and unvarying. It is 
important to note that habituation is 
appropriately considered as a 
‘‘progressive reduction in response to 
stimuli that are perceived as neither 
aversive nor beneficial,’’ rather than as, 
more generally, moderation in response 
to human disturbance (Bejder et al., 
2009). The opposite process is 
sensitization, when an unpleasant 
experience leads to subsequent 
responses, often in the form of 
avoidance, at a lower level of exposure. 
As noted, behavioral state may affect the 
type of response. For example, animals 
that are resting may show greater 
behavioral change in response to 
disturbing sound levels than animals 
that are highly motivated to remain in 
an area for feeding (Richardson et al., 
1995; National Research Council (NRC), 
2003; Wartzok et al., 2003). Controlled 
experiments with captive marine 
mammals have shown pronounced 
behavioral reactions, including 
avoidance of loud sound sources 
(Ridgway et al., 1997). Observed responses of wild marine mammals to 
loud pulsed sound sources (typically 
seismic airguns or acoustic harassment 
devices) have been varied but often 
consist of avoidance behavior or other 
behavioral changes suggesting 
discomfort (Morton and Symonds, 2002; 
see also Richardson et al., 1995; 
Nowacek et al., 2007). However, many delphinids approach acoustic source 
vessels with no apparent discomfort or 
obvious behavioral change (e.g., 
Barkaszi et al., 2012, Barkaszi and Kelly, 2018). 
Available studies show wide variation 
in response to underwater sound; 
therefore, it is difficult to predict 
specifically how any given sound in a 
particular instance might affect marine 
mammals perceiving the signal. If a 
marine mammal does react briefly to an 
underwater sound by changing its 
behavior or moving a small distance, the 
impacts of the change are unlikely to be 
significant to the individual, let alone 
the stock or population. However, if a 
sound source displaces marine 
mammals from an important feeding or 
breeding area for a prolonged period, 
impacts on individuals and populations 
could be significant (e.g., Lusseau and Bejder, 2007; Weilgart, 2007; NRC, 
2005). There are broad categories of 
potential response, which we describe 
in greater detail here, that include 
alteration of dive behavior, alteration of 
foraging behavior, effects to breathing, 
interference with or alteration of 
vocalization, avoidance, and flight. 
Changes in dive behavior can vary 
widely, and may consist of increased or 
decreased dive times and surface 
intervals as well as changes in the rates 
of ascent and descent during a dive (e.g., 
Frankel and Clark, 2000; Ng and Leung, 
2003; Nowacek et al., 2004; Goldbogen 
et al., 2013a, b). Variations in dive 
behavior may reflect disruptions in 
biologically significant activities (e.g., 
foraging) or they may be of little 
biological significance. The impact of an 
alteration to dive behavior resulting 
from an acoustic exposure depends on 
what the animal is doing at the time of 
the exposure and the type and 
magnitude of the response. 
Disruption of feeding behavior can be 
difficult to correlate with anthropogenic 
sound exposure, so it is usually inferred 
by observed displacement from known 
foraging areas, the appearance of 
secondary indicators (e.g., bubble nets or sediment plumes), or changes in dive 
behavior. As for other types of 
behavioral response, the frequency, 
duration, and temporal pattern of signal 
presentation, as well as differences in

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259340 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices species sensitivity, are likely 
contributing factors to differences in 
response in any given circumstance 
(e.g., Croll et al., 2001; Nowacek et al., 2004; Madsen et al., 2006; Yazvenko et 
al., 2007a, b). A determination of whether foraging disruptions affect 
fitness consequences would require 
information on or estimates of the 
energetic requirements of the affected 
individuals and the relationship 
between prey availability, foraging effort 
and success, and the life history stage of 
the animal. 
Visual tracking, passive acoustic 
monitoring (PAM), and movement 
recording tags were used to quantify 
sperm whale behavior prior to, during, 
and following exposure to airgun arrays 
at received levels in the range 140–160 
dB at distances of 7–13 km, following a 
phase-in of sound intensity and full 
array exposures at 1–13 km (Madsen et 
al., 2006; Miller et al., 2009). Sperm whales did not exhibit horizontal 
avoidance behavior at the surface. 
However, foraging behavior may have 
been affected. The sperm whales 
exhibited 19 percent less vocal, or buzz, 
rate during full exposure relative to post 
exposure, and the whale that was 
approached most closely had an 
extended resting period and did not 
resume foraging until the airguns had 
ceased firing. The remaining whales 
continued to execute foraging dives 
throughout exposure; however, 
swimming movements during foraging 
dives were 6 percent lower during 
exposure than control periods (Miller et 
al., 2009). These data raise concerns that seismic surveys may impact foraging 
behavior in sperm whales, although 
more data are required to understand 
whether the differences were due to 
exposure or natural variation in sperm 
whale behavior (Miller et al., 2009). 
Changes in respiration naturally vary 
with different behaviors and alterations 
to breathing rate as a function of 
acoustic exposure can be expected to co- 
occur with other behavioral reactions, 
such as a flight response or an alteration 
in diving. However, respiration rates in 
and of themselves may be representative 
of annoyance or an acute stress 
response. Various studies have shown 
that respiration rates may either be 
unaffected or could increase, depending 
on the species and signal characteristics, 
again highlighting the importance in 
understanding species differences in the 
tolerance of underwater noise when 
determining the potential for impacts 
resulting from anthropogenic sound 
exposure (e.g., Kastelein et al., 2001, 2005, 2006; Gailey et al., 2007, 2016). 
Marine mammals vocalize for 
different purposes and across multiple 
modes, such as whistling, echolocation 
click production, calling, and singing. 
Changes in vocalization behavior in 
response to anthropogenic noise can 
occur for any of these modes and may 
result from a need to compete with an 
increase in background noise or may 
reflect increased vigilance or a startle 
response. For example, in the presence 
of potentially masking signals, 
humpback whales and killer whales 
have been observed to increase the 
length of their songs or amplitude of 
calls (Miller et al., 2000; Fristrup et al., 
2003; Foote et al., 2004; Holt et al., 
2012), while right whales have been 
observed to shift the frequency content 
of their calls upward while reducing the 
rate of calling in areas of increased 
anthropogenic noise (Parks et al., 2007). 
In some cases, animals may cease sound 
production during production of 
aversive signals (Bowles et al., 1994). 
Cerchio et al. (2014) used PAM to document the presence of singing 
humpback whales off the coast of 
northern Angola and to 
opportunistically test for the effect of 
seismic survey activity on the number of 
singing whales. Two recording units 
were deployed between March and 
December 2008 in the offshore 
environment; numbers of singers were 
counted every hour. Generalized 
additive mixed models were used to 
assess the effect of survey day 
(seasonality), hour (diel variation), 
moon phase, and received levels of 
noise (measured from a single pulse 
during each 10 minutes sampled period) 
on singer number. The number of 
singers significantly decreased with 
increasing received level of noise, 
suggesting that humpback whale 
communication was disrupted to some 
extent by the survey activity. 
Castellote et al. (2012) reported acoustic and behavioral changes by fin 
whales in response to shipping and 
airgun noise. Acoustic features of fin 
whale song notes recorded in the 
Mediterranean Sea and northeast 
Atlantic Ocean were compared for areas 
with different shipping noise levels and 
traffic intensities and during a seismic 
airgun survey. During the first 72 hours 
of the survey, a steady decrease in song 
received levels and bearings to singers 
indicated that whales moved away from 
the acoustic source and out of the study 
area. This displacement persisted for a 
time period well beyond the 10-day 
duration of seismic airgun activity, 
providing evidence that fin whales may 
avoid an area for an extended period in 
the presence of increased noise. The 
authors hypothesize that fin whale 
acoustic communication is modified to 
compensate for increased background 
noise and that a sensitization process 
may play a role in the observed 
temporary displacement. 
Seismic pulses at average received 
levels of 131 dB re 1 mPa
2
-s caused blue 
whales to increase call production (Di 
Iorio and Clark, 2009). In contrast, 
McDonald et al. (1995) tracked a blue whale with seafloor seismometers and 
reported that it stopped vocalizing and 
changed its travel direction at a range of 
10 km from the acoustic source vessel 
(estimated received level 143 dB pk-pk). 
Blackwell et al. (2013) found that bowhead whale call rates dropped 
significantly at onset of airgun use at 
sites with a median distance of 41–45 
km from the survey. Blackwell et al. 
(2015) expanded this analysis to show 
that whales actually increased calling 
rates as soon as airgun signals were 
detectable before ultimately decreasing 
calling rates at higher received levels 
(i.e., 10-minute cumulative SEL (SELcum
) 
of 127 dB). Overall, these results suggest that bowhead whales may adjust 
their vocal output in an effort to 
compensate for noise before ceasing 
vocalization effort and ultimately 
deflecting from the acoustic source 
(Blackwell et al., 2013, 2015). These studies demonstrate that even low levels 
of noise received far from the source can 
induce changes in vocalization and/or 
behavior for mysticetes. 
Avoidance is the displacement of an 
individual from an area or migration 
path as a result of the presence of sound 
or other stressors, and is one of the most 
obvious manifestations of disturbance in 
marine mammals (Richardson et al., 
1995). For example, gray whales are 
known to change direction—deflecting 
from customary migratory paths—in 
order to avoid noise from seismic 
surveys (Malme et al., 1984). Humpback 
whales show avoidance behavior in the 
presence of an active seismic array 
during observational studies and 
controlled exposure experiments in 
western Australia (McCauley et al., 
2000). Avoidance may be short-term, 
with animals returning to the area once 
the noise has ceased (e.g., Bowles et al., 1994; Goold, 1996; Stone et al., 2000; 
Morton and Symonds, 2002; Gailey et 
al., 2007). Longer-term displacement is possible, however, which may lead to 
changes in abundance or distribution 
patterns of the affected species in the 
affected region if habituation to the 
presence of the sound does not occur 
(e.g., Bejder et al., 2006; Teilmann et al., 2006).

mammal populations with high site 
fidelity, including displacement and

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259341 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices observed response does not imply 
absence of fitness costs and that 
apparent tolerance of disturbance may 
have population-level impacts that are 
less obvious and difficult to document. 
Avoidance of overlap between 
disturbing noise and areas and/or times 
of particular importance for sensitive 
species may be critical to avoiding 
population-level impacts because 
(particularly for animals with high site 
fidelity) there may be a strong 
motivation to remain in the area despite 
negative impacts. Forney et al. (2017) 
state that, for these animals, remaining 
in a disturbed area may reflect a lack of 
alternatives rather than a lack of effects. 
Forney et al. (2017) specifically discuss beaked whales, stating that until 
recently most knowledge of beaked 
whales was derived from strandings, as 
they have been involved in atypical 
mass stranding events associated with 
mid-frequency active (MFA) sonar 
training operations. Given these 
observations and recent research, 
beaked whales appear to be particularly 
sensitive and vulnerable to certain types 
of acoustic disturbance relative to most 
other marine mammal species. 
Individual beaked whales reacted 
strongly to experiments using simulated 
MFA sonar at low received levels, by 
moving away from the sound source and 
stopping foraging for extended periods. 
These responses, if on a frequent basis, 
could result in significant fitness costs 
to individuals (Forney et al., 2017). 
Additionally, difficulty in detection of 
beaked whales due to their cryptic 
surfacing behavior and silence when 
near the surface pose problems for 
mitigation measures employed to 
protect beaked whales. Forney et al. 
(2017) specifically states that failure to 
consider both displacement of beaked 
whales from their habitat and noise 
exposure could lead to more severe 
biological consequences. 
A flight response is a dramatic change 
in normal movement to a directed and 
rapid movement away from the 
perceived location of a sound source. 
The flight response differs from other 
avoidance responses in the intensity of 
the response (e.g., directed movement, rate of travel). Relatively little 
information on flight responses of 
marine mammals to anthropogenic 
signals exist, although observations of 
flight responses to the presence of 
predators have occurred (Connor and 
Heithaus, 1996). The result of a flight 
response could range from brief, 
temporary exertion and displacement 
from the area where the signal provokes 
flight to, in extreme cases, marine 
mammal strandings (Evans and 
England, 2001). However, it should be 
noted that response to a perceived 
predator does not necessarily invoke 
flight (Ford and Reeves, 2008), and 
whether individuals are solitary or in 
groups may influence the response. 
Behavioral disturbance can also 
impact marine mammals in more subtle 
ways. Increased vigilance may result in 
costs related to diversion of focus and 
attention (i.e., when a response consists of increased vigilance, it may come at 
the cost of decreased attention to other 
critical behaviors such as foraging or 
resting). These effects have generally not 
been demonstrated for marine 
mammals, but studies involving fish 
and terrestrial animals have shown that 
increased vigilance may substantially 
reduce feeding rates (e.g., Beauchamp and Livoreil, 1997; Fritz et al., 2002; 
Purser and Radford, 2011). In addition, 
chronic disturbance can cause 
population declines through reduction 
of fitness (e.g., decline in body condition) and subsequent reduction in 
reproductive success, survival, or both 
(e.g., Harrington and Veitch, 1992; Daan et al., 1996; Bradshaw et al., 1998). 
However, Ridgway et al. (2006) reported 
that increased vigilance in bottlenose 
dolphins exposed to sound over a 5-day 
period did not cause any sleep 
deprivation or stress effects. 
Many animals perform vital functions, 
such as feeding, resting, traveling, and 
socializing, on a diel cycle (24-hour 
cycle). Disruption of such functions 
resulting from reactions to stressors, 
such as sound exposure, are more likely 
to be significant if they last more than 
one diel cycle or recur on subsequent 
days (Southall et al., 2007). 
Consequently, a behavioral response 
lasting less than 1 day and not recurring 
on subsequent days is not considered 
particularly severe unless it could 
directly affect reproduction or survival 
(Southall et al., 2007). Note that there is a difference between multi-day 
substantive behavioral reactions and 
multi-day anthropogenic activities. For 
example, just because an activity lasts 
for multiple days does not necessarily 
mean that individual animals are either 
exposed to activity-related stressors for 
multiple days or, further, exposed in a 
manner resulting in sustained multi-day 
substantive behavioral responses. 
Stone (2015) reported data from at-sea 
observations during 1,196 seismic 
surveys from 1994 to 2010. When large 
arrays of airguns (considered to be 500 
in
3
(8,294 cc) or more in that study) 
were firing, lateral displacement, more 
localized avoidance, or other changes in 
behavior were evident for most 
odontocetes. However, significant 
responses to large arrays were found 
only for the minke whale and fin whale. 
Behavioral responses observed included 
changes in swimming or surfacing 
behavior, with indications that 
cetaceans remained near the water 
surface at these times. Cetaceans were 
recorded as feeding less often when 
large arrays were active. Behavioral 
observations of gray whales during a 
seismic survey monitored whale 
movements and respirations pre-, 
during, and post-seismic survey (Gailey 
et al., 2016). Behavioral state and water 
depth were the best ‘‘natural’’ predictors 
of whale movements and respiration 
and, after considering natural variation, 
none of the response variables were 
significantly associated with seismic 
survey or vessel sounds. 
Stress Responses—An animal’s 
perception of a threat may be sufficient 
to trigger stress responses consisting of 
some combination of behavioral 
responses, autonomic nervous system 
responses, neuroendocrine responses, or 
immune responses (e.g., Seyle, 1950; Moberg, 2000). In many cases, an 
animal’s first and sometimes most 
economical (in terms of energetic costs) 
response is behavioral avoidance of the 
potential stressor. Autonomic nervous 
system responses to stress typically 
involve changes in heart rate, blood 
pressure, and gastrointestinal activity. 
These responses have a relatively short 
duration and may or may not have a 
significant long-term effect on an 
animal’s fitness. 
Neuroendocrine stress responses often 
involve the hypothalamus-pituitary- 
adrenal system. Virtually all 
neuroendocrine functions that are 
affected by stress—including immune 
competence, reproduction, metabolism, 
and behavior—are regulated by pituitary 
hormones. Stress-induced changes in 
the secretion of pituitary hormones have 
been implicated in failed reproduction, 
altered metabolism, reduced immune 
competence, and behavioral disturbance 
(e.g., Moberg, 1987; Blecha, 2000). Increases in the circulation of 
glucocorticoids are also equated with 
stress (Romano et al., 2004). 
The primary distinction between 
stress (which is adaptive and does not 
normally place an animal at risk) and 
distress is the cost of the response. 
During a stress response, an animal uses 
glycogen stores that can be quickly 
replenished once the stress is alleviated. 
In such circumstances, the cost of the 
stress response would not pose serious 
fitness consequences. However, when 
an animal does not have sufficient 
energy reserves to satisfy the energetic 
costs of a stress response, energy 
resources must be diverted from other 
functions. This state of distress will last 
until the animal replenishes its

normal function. 
Relationships between these 
physiological mechanisms, animal 
behavior, and the costs of stress 
responses are well-studied through 
controlled experiments and for both 
laboratory and free-ranging animals 
(e.g., Holberton et al., 1996; Hood et al., 1998; Jessop et al., 2003; Krausman et 
al., 2004; Lankford et al., 2005). Stress responses due to exposure to 
anthropogenic sounds or other stressors 
and their effects on marine mammals 
have also been reviewed (Fair and 
Becker, 2000; Romano et al., 2002b) 
and, more rarely, studied in wild 
populations (e.g., Romano et al., 2002a). For example, Rolland et al. (2012) found 
that noise reduction from reduced ship 
traffic in the Bay of Fundy was 
associated with decreased stress in 
North Atlantic right whales. These and 
other studies lead to a reasonable 
expectation that some marine mammals 
will experience physiological stress 
responses upon exposure to acoustic 
stressors and that it is possible that 
some of these would be classified as 
‘‘distress.’’ In addition, any animal 
experiencing TTS would likely also 
experience stress responses (NRC, 
2003). 
Auditory Masking—Sound can 
disrupt behavior through masking, or 
interfering with, an animal’s ability to 
detect, recognize, or discriminate 
between acoustic signals of interest (e.g., 
those used for intraspecific 
communication and social interactions, 
prey detection, predator avoidance, 
navigation) (Richardson et al., 1995; 
Erbe et al., 2016). Masking occurs when the receipt of a sound is interfered with 
by another coincident sound at similar 
frequencies and at similar or higher 
intensity, and may occur whether the 
sound is natural (e.g., snapping shrimp, wind, waves, precipitation) or 
anthropogenic (e.g., shipping, sonar, seismic exploration) in origin. The 
ability of a noise source to mask 
biologically important sounds depends 
on the characteristics of both the noise 
source and the signal of interest (e.g., 
signal-to-noise ratio, temporal 
variability, direction), in relation to each 
other and to an animal’s hearing 
abilities (e.g., sensitivity, frequency range, critical ratios, frequency 
discrimination, directional 
discrimination, age or TTS hearing loss), 
and existing ambient noise and 
propagation conditions. 
Under certain circumstances, 
significant masking could disrupt 
behavioral patterns, which in turn could 
affect fitness for survival and 
reproduction. It is important to 
distinguish TTS and PTS, which persist 
after the sound exposure, from masking, 
which occurs during the sound 
exposure. Because masking (without 
resulting in a TS) is not associated with 
abnormal physiological function, it is 
not considered a physiological effect, 
but rather a potential behavioral effect. 
The frequency range of the potentially 
masking sound is important in 
predicting any potential behavioral 
impacts. For example, low-frequency 
signals may have less effect on high- 
frequency echolocation sounds 
produced by odontocetes but are more 
likely to affect detection of mysticete 
communication calls and other 
potentially important natural sounds 
such as those produced by surf and 
some prey species. The masking of 
communication signals by 
anthropogenic noise may be considered 
as a reduction in the communication 
space of animals (e.g., Clark et al., 2009) and may result in energetic or other 
costs as animals change their 
vocalization behavior (e.g., Miller et al., 2000; Foote et al., 2004; Parks et al., 
2007; Di Iorio and Clark, 2010; Holt et 
al., 2009). Masking may be less in situations where the signal and noise 
come from different directions 
(Richardson et al., 1995), through amplitude modulation of the signal, or 
through other compensatory behaviors 
(Houser and Moore, 2014). Masking can 
be tested directly in captive species 
(e.g., Erbe, 2008), but in wild populations it must be either modeled 
or inferred from evidence of masking 
compensation. There are few studies 
addressing real-world masking sounds 
likely to be experienced by marine 
mammals in the wild (e.g., Branstetter et al., 2013). Masking affects both senders and 
receivers of acoustic signals and can 
potentially have long-term chronic 
effects on marine mammals at the 
population level as well as at the 
individual level. Low-frequency 
ambient sound levels have increased by 
as much as 20 dB (more than three times 
in terms of SPL) in the world’s ocean 
from pre-industrial periods, with most 
of the increase from distant commercial 
shipping (Hildebrand, 2009). All 
anthropogenic sound sources, but 
especially chronic and lower-frequency 
signals (e.g., from vessel traffic), contribute to elevated ambient sound 
levels, thus intensifying masking. 
Masking effects of pulsed sounds 
(even from large arrays of airguns) on 
marine mammal calls and other natural 
sounds are expected to be limited, 
although there are few specific data on 
this. Because of the intermittent nature 
and low duty cycle of seismic pulses, 
animals can emit and receive sounds in 
the relatively quiet intervals between 
pulses. However, in exceptional 
situations, reverberation occurs for 
much or all of the interval between 
pulses (e.g., Simard et al., 2005; Clark and Gagnon 2006), which could mask 
calls. Situations with prolonged strong 
reverberation are infrequent. However, 
it is common for reverberation to cause 
some lesser degree of elevation of the 
background level between airgun pulses 
(e.g., Gedamke 2011; Guerra et al., 2011, 
2016; Klinck et al., 2012; Guan et al., 
2015), and this weaker reverberation 
presumably reduces the detection range 
of calls and other natural sounds to 
some degree. Guerra et al. (2016) 
reported that ambient noise levels 
between seismic pulses were elevated as 
a result of reverberation at ranges of 50 
km from the seismic source. Based on 
measurements in deep water of the 
Southern Ocean, Gedamke (2011) 
estimated that the slight elevation of 
background noise levels during intervals 
between seismic pulses reduced blue 
and fin whale communication space by 
as much as 36–51 percent when a 
seismic survey was operating 450–2,800 
km away. Based on preliminary 
modeling, Wittekind et al. (2016) 
reported that airgun sounds could 
reduce the communication range of blue 
and fin whales 2,000 km from the 
seismic source. Nieukirk et al. (2012) 
and Blackwell et al. (2013) noted the 
potential for masking effects from 
seismic surveys on large whales. 
Some baleen and toothed whales are 
known to continue calling in the 
presence of seismic pulses, and their 
calls usually can be heard between the 
pulses (e.g., Nieukirk et al., 2012; Thode et al., 2012; Bro¨ker et al., 2013; Sciacca et al., 2016). Cerchio et al. (2014) 
suggested that the breeding display of 
humpback whales off Angola could be 
disrupted by seismic sounds, as singing 
activity declined with increasing 
received levels. In addition, some 
cetaceans are known to change their 
calling rates, shift their peak 
frequencies, or otherwise modify their 
vocal behavior in response to airgun 
sounds (e.g., Di Iorio and Clark 2010; Castellote et al., 2012; Blackwell et al., 2013, 2015). The hearing systems of 
baleen whales are more sensitive to low- 
frequency sounds than are the ears of 
the small odontocetes that have been 
studied directly (e.g., MacGillivray et al., 2014). The sounds important to small odontocetes are predominantly at 
much higher frequencies than are the 
dominant components of airgun sounds, 
thus limiting the potential for masking. 
In general, masking effects of seismic

the normally intermittent nature of 
seismic pulses. 
Vessel Noise 
Vessel noise from the Langseth could affect marine animals in the proposed 
survey areas. Houghton et al. (2015) 
proposed that vessel speed is the most 
important predictor of received noise 
levels, and Putland et al. (2017) also 
reported reduced sound levels with 
decreased vessel speed. However, some 
energy is also produced at higher 
frequencies (Hermannsen et al., 2014); 
low levels of high-frequency sound from 
vessels has been shown to elicit 
responses in harbor porpoise (Dyndo et 
al., 2015). Vessel noise, through masking, can 
reduce the effective communication 
distance of a marine mammal if the 
frequency of the sound source is close 
to that used by the animal, and if the 
sound is present for a significant 
fraction of time (e.g., Richardson et al., 1995; Clark et al., 2009; Jensen et al., 
2009; Gervaise et al., 2012; Hatch et al., 
2012; Rice et al., 2014; Dunlop 2015; 
Jones et al., 2017; Putland et al., 2017). In addition to the frequency and 
duration of the masking sound, the 
strength, temporal pattern, and location 
of the introduced sound also play a role 
in the extent of the masking (Branstetter 
et al., 2013, 2016; Finneran and 
Branstetter 2013; Sills et al., 2017). 
Branstetter et al. (2013) reported that time-domain metrics are also important 
in describing and predicting masking. 
Baleen whales are thought to be more 
sensitive to sound at these low 
frequencies than are toothed whales 
(e.g., MacGillivray et al., 2014), possibly causing localized avoidance of the 
proposed survey area during seismic 
operations. Many odontocetes show 
considerable tolerance of vessel traffic, 
although they sometimes react at long 
distances if confined by ice or shallow 
water, if previously harassed by vessels, 
or have had little or no recent exposure 
to vessels (Richardson et al., 1995). 
Pirotta et al. (2015) noted that the physical presence of vessels, not just 
ship noise, disturbed the foraging 
activity of bottlenose dolphins. There is 
little data on the behavioral reactions of 
beaked whales to vessel noise, though 
they seem to avoid approaching vessels 
(e.g., Wu¨rsig et al., 1998) or dive for an extended period when approached by a 
vessel (e.g., Kasuya, 1986). In summary, project vessel sounds 
would not be at levels expected to cause 
anything more than possible localized 
and temporary behavioral changes in 
marine mammals, and would not be 
expected to result in significant negative 
effects on individuals or at the 
population level. In addition, in all 
oceans of the world, large vessel traffic 
is currently so prevalent that it is 
commonly considered a usual source of 
ambient sound (NSF–USGS, 2011). 
Vessel Strike 
Vessel collisions with marine 
mammals, or vessel strikes, can result in 
death or serious injury of the animal. 
Wounds resulting from vessel strike 
may include massive trauma, 
hemorrhaging, broken bones, or 
propeller lacerations (Knowlton and 
Kraus, 2001). An animal at the surface 
may be struck directly by a vessel, a 
surfacing animal may hit the bottom of 
a vessel, or an animal just below the 
surface may be cut by a vessel’s 
propeller. Superficial strikes may not 
kill or result in the death of the animal. 
These interactions are typically 
associated with large whales (e.g., fin whales), which are occasionally found 
draped across the bulbous bow of large 
commercial vessels upon arrival in port. 
Although smaller cetaceans are more 
maneuverable in relation to large vessels 
than are large whales, they may also be 
susceptible to strike. The severity of 
injuries typically depends on the size 
and speed of the vessel, with the 
probability of death or serious injury 
increasing as vessel speed increases 
(Knowlton and Kraus, 2001; Laist et al., 
2001; Vanderlaan and Taggart, 2007; 
Conn and Silber, 2013). Impact forces 
increase with speed, as does the 
probability of a strike at a given distance 
(Silber et al., 2010; Gende et al., 2011). Pace and Silber (2005) also found that 
the probability of death or serious injury 
increased rapidly with increasing vessel 
speed. Specifically, the predicted 
probability of serious injury or death 
increased from 45 to 75 percent as 
vessel speed increased from 10 to 14 
knots (kn, 26 kilometer per hour (kph)), 
and exceeded 90 percent at 17 kn (31 
kph). Higher speeds during collisions 
result in greater force of impact, but 
higher speeds also appear to increase 
the chance of severe injuries or death 
through increased likelihood of 
collision by pulling whales toward the 
vessel (Clyne, 1999; Knowlton et al., 
1995). In a separate study, Vanderlaan 
and Taggart (2007) analyzed the 
probability of lethal mortality of large 
whales at a given speed, showing that 
the greatest rate of change in the 
probability of a lethal injury to a large 
whale as a function of vessel speed 
occurs between 8.6 and 15 kn (28 kph). 
The chances of a lethal injury decline 
from approximately 80 percent at 15 kn 
(28 kph) to approximately 20 percent at 
8.6 kn (16 kph). At speeds below 11.8 
kn (22 kph), the chances of lethal injury 
drop below 50 percent, while the 
probability asymptotically increases 
toward one hundred percent above 15 
kn (28 kph). 
The Langseth will travel at a speed of 5 kn (9 kph) while towing seismic 
survey gear. At this speed, both the 
possibility of striking a marine mammal 
and the possibility of a strike resulting 
in serious injury or mortality are 
discountable. At average transit speed, 
the probability of serious injury or 
mortality resulting from a strike is less 
than 50 percent. However, the 
likelihood of a strike actually happening 
is again discountable. Vessel strikes, as 
analyzed in the studies cited above, 
generally involve commercial shipping, 
which is much more common in both 
space and time than is geophysical 
survey activity. Jensen and Silber (2004) 
summarized vessel strikes of large 
whales worldwide from 1975 to 2003 
and found that most collisions occurred 
in the open ocean and involved large 
vessels (e.g., commercial shipping). No such incidents were reported for 
geophysical survey vessels during that 
time period. 
It is possible for vessel strikes to occur 
while traveling at slow speeds. For 
example, a hydrographic survey vessel 
traveling at low speed (5.5 kn (10 kph)) 
while conducting mapping surveys off 
the central California coast struck and 
killed a blue whale in 2009. The State 
of California determined that the whale 
had suddenly and unexpectedly 
surfaced beneath the hull, with the 
result that the propeller severed the 
whale’s vertebrae, and that this was an 
unavoidable event. This strike 
represents the only such incident in 
approximately 540,000 hours of similar 
coastal mapping activity (p = 1.9 × 10¥6
; 
95 percent confidence interval = 0–5.5 
× 10¥6
; NMFS, 2013). In addition, a 
research vessel reported a fatal strike in 
2011 of a dolphin in the Atlantic, 
demonstrating that it is possible for 
strikes involving smaller cetaceans to 
occur. In that case, the incident report 
indicated that an animal apparently was 
struck by the vessel’s propeller as it was 
intentionally swimming near the vessel. 
While indicative of the type of unusual 
events that cannot be ruled out, neither 
of these instances represents a 
circumstance that would be considered 
reasonably foreseeable or that would be 
considered preventable. 
Although the likelihood of the vessel 
striking a marine mammal is low, we 
propose a robust vessel strike avoidance 
protocol (see Proposed Mitigation), 
which we believe eliminates any 
foreseeable risk of vessel strike during 
transit. We anticipate that vessel

acquisition vessel towing gear, while 
not impossible, represent unlikely, 
unpredictable events for which there are 
no preventive measures. Given the 
proposed mitigation measures, the 
relatively slow speed of the vessel 
towing gear, the presence of bridge crew 
watching for obstacles at all times 
(including marine mammals), and the 
presence of marine mammal observers, 
the possibility of vessel strike is 
discountable and, further, were a strike 
of a large whale to occur, it would be 
unlikely to result in serious injury or 
mortality. No incidental take resulting 
from vessel strike is anticipated, and 
this potential effect of the specified 
activity will not be discussed further in 
the following analysis. 
Stranding—When a living or dead 
marine mammal swims or floats onto 
shore and becomes ‘‘beached’’ or 
incapable of returning to sea, the event 
is a ‘‘stranding’’ (Geraci et al., 1999; 
Perrin and Geraci, 2002; Geraci and 
Lounsbury, 2005; NMFS, 2007). The 
legal definition for a stranding under the 
MMPA is that a marine mammal is dead 
and is on a beach or shore of the United 
States; or in waters under the 
jurisdiction of the United States 
(including any navigable waters); or a 
marine mammal is alive and is on a 
beach or shore of the United States and 
is unable to return to the water; on a 
beach or shore of the United States and, 
although able to return to the water, is 
in need of apparent medical attention; 
or in the waters under the jurisdiction 
of the United States (including any 
navigable waters), but is unable to 
return to its natural habitat under its 
own power or without assistance. 
Marine mammals strand for a variety 
of reasons, such as infectious agents, 
biotoxicosis, starvation, fishery 
interaction, vessel strike, unusual 
oceanographic or weather events, sound 
exposure, or combinations of these 
stressors sustained concurrently or in 
series. However, the cause or causes of 
most strandings are unknown (Geraci et 
al., 1976; Eaton, 1979; Odell et al., 1980; Best, 1982). Numerous studies suggest 
that the physiology, behavior, habitat 
relationships, age, or condition of 
cetaceans may cause them to strand or 
might predispose them to strand when 
exposed to another phenomenon. These 
suggestions are consistent with the 
conclusions of numerous other studies 
that have demonstrated that 
combinations of dissimilar stressors 
commonly combine to kill an animal or 
dramatically reduce its fitness, even 
though one exposure without the other 
does not produce the same result 
(Chroussos, 2000; Creel, 2005; DeVries 
et al., 2003; Fair and Becker, 2000; Foley 
et al., 2001; Moberg, 2000; Relyea, 
2005a; 2005b, Romero, 2004; Sih et al., 
2004). 
There is no conclusive evidence that 
exposure to airgun noise results in 
behaviorally-mediated forms of injury. 
Behaviorally-mediated injury (i.e., mass stranding events) has been primarily 
associated with beaked whales exposed 
to MFA sonar. MFA sonar and the 
alerting stimulus used in Nowacek et al. 
(2004) are very different from the noise 
produced by airguns. One should 
therefore not expect the same reaction to 
airgun noise as to these other sources. 
As explained below, military MFA 
sonar is very different from airguns, and 
one should not assume that airguns will 
cause the same effects as MFA sonar 
(including strandings). 
To understand why military MFA 
sonar affects beaked whales differently 
than airguns do, it is important to note 
the distinction between behavioral 
sensitivity and susceptibility to auditory 
injury. To understand the potential for 
auditory injury in a particular marine 
mammal species in relation to a given 
acoustic signal, the frequency range the 
species is able to hear is critical, as well 
as the species’ auditory sensitivity to 
frequencies within that range. Current 
data indicate that not all marine 
mammal species have equal hearing 
capabilities across all frequencies and, 
therefore, species are grouped into 
hearing groups with generalized hearing 
ranges assigned on the basis of available 
data (Southall et al., 2007, 2019). 
Hearing ranges as well as auditory 
sensitivity/susceptibility to frequencies 
within those ranges vary across the 
different groups. For example, in terms 
of hearing range, the very high- 
frequency cetaceans (e.g., Kogia spp.) 
have a generalized hearing range of 
frequencies between 200 Hz and 165 
kHz, while high-frequency cetaceans— 
such as dolphins and beaked whales— 
have a generalized hearing range 
between 150 Hz to 160 kHz. Regarding 
auditory susceptibility within the 
hearing range, while high-frequency 
cetaceans and very high-frequency 
cetaceans have roughly similar hearing 
ranges, the high-frequency group is 
much more susceptible to noise-induced 
hearing loss during sound exposure, i.e., 
these species have lower thresholds for 
these effects than other hearing groups 
(NMFS, 2018, 2024). Referring to a 
species as behaviorally sensitive to 
noise simply means that an animal of 
that species is more likely to respond to 
lower received levels of sound than an 
animal of another species that is 
considered less behaviorally sensitive. 
So, while dolphin species and beaked 
whale species—both in the high- 
frequency cetacean hearing group—are 
assumed to generally hear the same 
sounds equally well and be equally 
susceptible to noise-induced hearing 
loss (auditory injury), the best available 
information indicates that a beaked 
whale is more likely to behaviorally 
respond to that sound at a lower 
received level compared to an animal 
from other high-frequency cetacean 
species that are less behaviorally 
sensitive. This distinction is important 
because, while beaked whales are more 
likely to respond behaviorally to sounds 
than are many other species (even at 
lower levels), they cannot hear the 
predominant, lower frequency sounds 
from seismic airguns as well as sounds 
that have more energy at frequencies 
that beaked whales can hear better (such 
as military MFA sonar). 
Military MFA sonar effects beaked 
whales differently than airguns do 
because it produces energy at different 
frequencies than airguns. High- 
frequency cetacean hearing is 
generically thought to be best between 
8.8 and 110 kHz, i.e., these cutoff values define the range above and below which 
a species in the group is assumed to 
have declining auditory sensitivity, 
until reaching frequencies that cannot 
be heard (NMFS, 2018, 2024). However, 
beaked whale hearing is likely best 
within a higher, narrower range (20–80 
kHz, with best sensitivity around 40 
kHz), based on a few measurements of 
hearing in stranded beaked whales 
(Cook et al., 2006; Finneran et al., 2009; Pacini et al., 2011) and several studies of acoustic signals produced by beaked 
whales (e.g., Frantzis et al., 2002; Johnson et al., 2004, 2006; Zimmer et al., 2005). While precaution requires that the full range of audibility be 
considered when assessing risks 
associated with noise exposure 
(Southall et al., 2007, 2019), animals typically produce sound at frequencies 
where they hear best. More recently, 
Southall et al. (2019) suggested that certain species in the historical high- 
frequency hearing group (beaked 
whales, sperm whales, and killer 
whales) are likely more sensitive to 
lower frequencies within the group’s 
generalized hearing range than are other 
species within the group, and state that 
the data for beaked whales suggest 
sensitivity to approximately 5 kHz. 
However, this information is consistent 
with the general conclusion that beaked 
whales (and other high-frequency 
cetaceans) are relatively insensitive to 
the frequencies where most energy of an 
airgun signal is found. Military MFA 
sonar is typically considered to operate

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259345 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices in the frequency range of approximately 
3–14 kHz (D’Amico et al., 2009), i.e., outside the range of likely best hearing 
for beaked whales but within or close to 
the lower bounds, whereas most energy 
in an airgun signal is radiated at much 
lower frequencies, below 500 Hz 
(Dragoset, 1990). 
It is important to distinguish between 
energy (loudness, measured in dB) and 
frequency (pitch, measured in Hz). In 
considering the potential impacts of 
mid-frequency components of airgun 
noise (1–10 kHz, where beaked whales 
can be expected to hear) on marine 
mammal hearing, one needs to account 
for the energy associated with these 
higher frequencies and determine what 
energy is truly ‘‘significant.’’ Although 
there is mid-frequency energy 
associated with airgun noise (as 
expected from a broadband source), 
airgun sound is predominantly below 1 
kHz (Breitzke et al., 2008; 
Tashmukhambetov et al., 2008; Tolstoy et al., 2009). As stated by Richardson et 
al. (1995), ‘‘[. . .] most emitted [seismic airgun] energy is at 10–120 Hz, but the 
pulses contain some energy up to 500– 
1,000 Hz.’’ Tolstoy et al. (2009) 
conducted empirical measurements, 
demonstrating that sound energy levels 
associated with airguns were at least 20 
dB lower at 1 kHz (considered ‘‘mid- 
frequency’’) compared to higher energy 
levels associated with lower frequencies 
(below 300 Hz) (‘‘all but a small fraction 
of the total energy being concentrated in 
the 10–300 Hz range’’ (Tolstoy et al., 
2009), and at higher frequencies (e.g., 
2.6–4 kHz), power might be less than 10 
percent of the peak power at 10 Hz. 
Energy levels measured by Tolstoy et al. 
(2009) were even lower at frequencies 
above 1 kHz. In addition, as sound 
propagates away from the source, it 
tends to lose higher-frequency 
components faster than low-frequency 
components (i.e., low-frequency sounds typically propagate longer distances 
than high-frequency sounds) (Diebold et 
al., 2010). Although higher-frequency components of airgun signals have been 
recorded, it is typically in surface- 
ducting conditions (e.g., DeRuiter et al., 2006; Madsen et al., 2006) or in shallow 
water, where there are advantageous 
propagation conditions for the higher 
frequency (but low-energy) components 
of the airgun signal (Hermannsen et al., 
2015). This should not be of concern 
because the likely behavioral reactions 
of beaked whales that can result in acute 
physical injury would result from noise 
exposure at depth (because of the 
potentially greater consequences of 
severe behavioral reactions). In 
summary, the frequency content of 
airgun signals is such that beaked 
whales will not be able to hear the 
signals well (compared to MFA sonar), 
especially at depth where we expect the 
consequences of noise exposure could 
be more severe. 
Aside from frequency content, there 
are other significant differences between 
MFA sonar signals and the sounds 
produced by airguns that minimize the 
risk of severe behavioral reactions that 
could lead to strandings or deaths at sea, 
e.g., significantly longer signal duration, horizontal sound direction, typical fast 
and unpredictable source movement. 
All of these characteristics of MFA 
sonar tend towards greater potential to 
cause severe behavioral or physiological 
reactions in exposed beaked whales that 
may contribute to stranding. Although 
both sources are powerful, MFA sonar 
contains significantly greater energy in 
the mid-frequency range, where beaked 
whales hear better. Short-duration, high 
energy pulses—such as those produced 
by airguns—have greater potential to 
cause damage to auditory structures 
(though this is unlikely for high- 
frequency cetaceans, as explained later 
in this document), but it is longer 
duration signals that have been 
implicated in the vast majority of 
beaked whale strandings. Faster, less 
predictable movements in combination 
with multiple source vessels are more 
likely to elicit a severe, potentially anti- 
predator response. Of additional interest 
in assessing the divergent characteristics 
of MFA sonar and airgun signals and 
their relative potential to cause 
stranding events or deaths at sea is the 
similarity between the MFA sonar 
signals and stereotyped calls of beaked 
whales’ primary predator: the killer 
whale (Zimmer and Tyack, 2007). 
Although generic disturbance stimuli— 
as airgun noise may be considered in 
this case for beaked whales—may also 
trigger antipredator responses, stronger 
responses should generally be expected 
when perceived risk is greater, as when 
the stimulus is confused for a known 
predator (Frid and Dill, 2002). In 
addition, because the source of the 
perceived predator (i.e., MFA sonar) will likely be closer to the whales 
(because attenuation limits the range of 
detection of mid-frequencies) and 
moving faster (because it will be on 
faster-moving vessels), any antipredator 
response would be more likely to be 
severe (with greater perceived predation 
risk, an animal is more likely to 
disregard the cost of the response; Frid 
and Dill, 2002). Indeed, when analyzing 
movements of a beaked whale exposed 
to playback of killer whale predation 
calls, Allen et al. (2014) found that the 
whale engaged in a prolonged, directed 
avoidance response, suggesting a 
behavioral reaction that could pose a 
risk factor for stranding. Overall, these 
significant differences between sound 
from MFA sonar and the mid-frequency 
sound component from airguns and the 
likelihood that MFA sonar signals will 
be interpreted in error as a predator are 
critical to understanding the likely risk 
of behaviorally-mediated injury due to 
seismic surveys. 
The available scientific literature also 
provides a useful contrast between 
airgun noise and MFA sonar regarding 
the likely risk of behaviorally-mediated 
injury. There is strong evidence for the 
association of beaked whale stranding 
events with MFA sonar use, and 
particularly detailed accounting of 
several events is available (e.g., a 2000 Bahamas stranding event for which 
investigators concluded that MFA sonar 
use was responsible; Evans and 
England, 2001). D’Amico et al., (2009) 
reviewed 126 beaked whale mass 
stranding events over the period from 
1950 (i.e., from the development of modern MFA sonar systems) through 
2004. Of these, there were two events 
where detailed information was 
available on both the timing and 
location of the stranding and the 
concurrent nearby naval activity, 
including verification of active MFA 
sonar usage, with no evidence for an 
alternative cause of stranding. An 
additional 10 events were at minimum 
spatially and temporally coincident 
with naval activity likely to have 
included MFA sonar use and, despite 
incomplete knowledge of timing and 
location of the stranding or the naval 
activity in some cases, there was no 
evidence for an alternative cause of 
stranding. The U.S. Navy has publicly 
stated agreement that five such events 
since 1996 were associated in time and 
space with MFA sonar use, either by the 
U.S. Navy alone or in joint training 
exercises with the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. The U.S. Navy 
additionally noted that, as of 2017, a 
2014 beaked whale stranding event in 
Crete coincident with naval exercises 
was under review and had not yet been 
determined to be linked to sonar 
activities (U.S. Navy, 2017). Separately, 
the International Council for the 
Exploration of the Sea reported in 2005 
that, worldwide, there have been about 
50 known strandings, consisting mostly 
of beaked whales, with a potential 
causal link to MFA sonar (International 
Council for the Exploration for the Sea, 
2005). In contrast, very few such 
associations have been made to seismic 
surveys, despite widespread use of

world. 
A review of possible stranding 
associations with seismic surveys 
(Castellote and Llorens, 2016) states 
that, ‘‘[s]peculation concerning possible 
links between seismic survey noise and 
cetacean strandings is available for a 
dozen events but without convincing 
causal evidence.’’ The authors’ search of 
available information found 10 events 
worth further investigation via a ranking 
system representing a rough metric of 
the relative level of confidence offered 
by the data for inferences about the 
possible role of the seismic survey in a 
given stranding event. Only three of 
these events involved beaked whales. 
Whereas D’Amico et al., (2009) used a 
1–5 ranking system, in which ‘‘1’’ 
represented the most robust evidence 
connecting the event to MFA sonar use, 
Castellote and Llorens (2016) used a 1– 
6 ranking system, in which ‘‘6’’ 
represented the most robust evidence 
connecting the event to the seismic 
survey. As described above, D’Amico et 
al. (2009) found that two events were ranked ‘‘1’’ and 10 events were ranked 
‘‘2’’ (i.e., 12 beaked whale stranding events were found to be associated with 
MFA sonar use). In contrast, Castellote 
and Llorens (2016) found that none of 
the three beaked whale stranding events 
achieved their highest ranks of 5 or 6. 
Of the 10 total events, none achieved 
the highest rank of 6. Two events were 
ranked as 5: one stranding in Peru 
involving dolphins and porpoises and a 
2008 stranding in Madagascar. This 
latter ranking can only be broadly 
associated with the survey itself, as 
opposed to use of seismic airguns. An 
investigation of this stranding event, 
which did not involve beaked whales, 
concluded that use of a high-frequency 
mapping system (12-kHz multibeam 
echosounder) was the most plausible 
and likely initial behavioral trigger of 
the event, which was likely exacerbated 
by several site- and situation-specific 
secondary factors. The review panel 
found that seismic airguns were used 
after the initial strandings and animals 
entering a lagoon system, that airgun 
use clearly had no role as an initial 
trigger, and that there was no evidence 
that airgun use dissuaded animals from 
leaving (Southall et al., 2013). 
However, one of these stranding 
events, involving two Cuvier’s beaked 
whales, was contemporaneous with and 
reasonably associated spatially with a 
2002 seismic survey in the Gulf of 
California conducted by L–DEO, as was 
the case for the 2007 Gulf of Cadiz 
seismic survey discussed by Castellote 
and Llorens (also involving two Cuvier’s 
beaked whales). Neither event was 
considered a ‘‘true atypical mass 
stranding’’ (according to Frantzis (1998)) 
as used in the analysis of Castellote and 
Llorens (2016). While we agree with the 
authors that this lack of evidence should 
not be considered conclusive, it is clear 
that there is very little evidence that 
seismic surveys should be considered as 
posing a significant risk of acute harm 
to beaked whales or other high- 
frequency cetaceans. We have 
considered the potential for the 
proposed surveys to result in marine 
mammal stranding and, based on the 
best available information, do not 
expect a stranding to occur. 
Entanglement—Entanglements occur 
when marine mammals become 
wrapped around cables, lines, nets, or 
other objects suspended in the water 
column. During seismic operations, 
numerous cables, lines, and other 
objects primarily associated with the 
airgun array and hydrophone streamers 
will be towed behind the Langseth near the water’s surface. However, we are not 
aware of any cases of entanglement of 
marine mammals in seismic survey 
equipment. No incidents of 
entanglement of marine mammals with 
seismic survey gear have been 
documented in over 54,000 nautical 
miles (100,000 km) of previous NSF- 
funded seismic surveys when observers 
were aboard (e.g., Smultea and Holst 2003; Haley and Koski 2004; Holst 2004; 
Smultea et al., 2004; Holst et al., 2005; Haley and Ireland 2006; SIO and NSF 
2006; Hauser et al., 2008; Holst and 
Smultea 2008). Although entanglement 
with the streamer is theoretically 
possible, it has not been documented 
during tens of thousands of miles of 
NSF-sponsored seismic cruises or, to 
our knowledge, during hundreds of 
thousands of miles of industrial seismic 
cruises. There are relatively few 
deployed devices, and no interaction 
between marine mammals and any such 
device has been recorded during prior 
NSF surveys using the devices. There 
are no meaningful entanglement risks 
posed by the proposed survey, and 
entanglement risks are not discussed 
further in this document. 
Anticipated Effects on Marine Mammal 
Habitat 
Effects to Prey—Marine mammal prey 
varies by species, season, and location 
and, for some, is not well documented. 
Fish react to sounds which are 
especially strong and/or intermittent 
low-frequency sounds, and behavioral 
responses such as flight or avoidance 
are the most likely effects. However, the 
reaction of fish to airguns depends on 
the physiological state of the fish, past 
exposures, motivation (e.g., feeding, spawning, migration), and other 
environmental factors. Several studies 
have demonstrated that airgun sounds 
might affect the distribution and 
behavior of some fishes, potentially 
impacting foraging opportunities or 
increasing energetic costs (e.g., Fewtrell and McCauley, 2012; Pearson et al., 
1992; Skalski et al., 1992; Santulli et al., 
1999; Paxton et al., 2017), though the 
bulk of studies indicate no or slight 
reaction to noise (e.g., Miller and Cripps, 2013; Dalen and Knutsen, 1987; 
Pen˜a et al., 2013; Chapman and Hawkins, 1969; Wardle et al., 2001; 
Jorgenson and Gyselman, 2009; Blaxter 
et al., 1981; Cott et al., 2012; Boeger et 
al., 2006), and that, most commonly, while there are likely to be impacts to 
fish as a result of noise from nearby 
airguns, such effects will be temporary. 
For example, investigators reported 
significant, short-term declines in 
commercial fishing catch rate of gadid 
fishes during and for up to 5 days after 
seismic survey operations, but the catch 
rate subsequently returned to normal 
(Engas et al., 1996; Engas and 
Lokkeborg, 2002). Other studies have 
reported similar findings (Hassel et al., 
2004). 
Skalski et al. (1992) also found a reduction in catch rates—for rockfish 
(Sebastes spp.) in response to controlled airgun exposure—but suggested that the 
mechanism underlying the decline was 
not dispersal but rather decreased 
responsiveness to baited hooks 
associated with an alarm behavioral 
response. A companion study showed 
that alarm and startle responses were 
not sustained following the removal of 
the sound source (Pearson et al., 1992). 
Therefore, Skalski et al. (1992) 
suggested that the effects on fish 
abundance may be transitory, primarily 
occurring during the sound exposure 
itself. In some cases, effects on catch 
rates are variable within a study, which 
may be more broadly representative of 
temporary displacement of fish in 
response to airgun noise (i.e., catch rates may increase in some locations and 
decrease in others) than any long-term 
damage to the fish themselves (Streever 
et al., 2016). 
SPLs of sufficient strength have been 
known to cause injury to fish and fish 
mortality and, in some studies, fish 
auditory systems have been damaged by 
airgun noise (McCauley et al., 2003; 
Popper et al., 2005; Song et al., 2008). However, in most fish species, hair cells 
in the ear continuously regenerate and 
loss of auditory function likely is 
restored when damaged cells are 
replaced with new cells. Halvorsen et al. 
(2012) showed that a TTS of 4–6 dB was

species. Impacts would be most severe 
when the individual fish is close to the 
source and when the duration of 
exposure is long; both of which are 
conditions unlikely to occur for this 
survey that is necessarily transient in 
any given location and likely result in 
brief, infrequent noise exposure to prey 
species in any given area. For this 
survey, the sound source is constantly 
moving, and most fish would likely 
avoid the sound source prior to 
receiving sound of sufficient intensity to 
cause physiological or anatomical 
damage. In addition, ramp-up may 
allow certain fish species the 
opportunity to move further away from 
the sound source. 
A comprehensive review (Carroll et 
al., 2017) found that results are mixed as to the effects of airgun noise on the 
prey of marine mammals. While some 
studies suggest a change in prey 
distribution and/or a reduction in prey 
abundance following the use of seismic 
airguns, others suggest no effects or 
even positive effects in prey abundance. 
As one specific example, Paxton et al. 
(2017), which describes findings related 
to the effects of a 2014 seismic survey 
on a reef off of North Carolina, showed 
a 78 percent decrease in observed 
nighttime abundance for certain species. 
It is important to note that the evening 
hours during which the decline in fish 
habitat use was recorded (via video 
recording) occurred on the same day 
that the seismic survey passed, and no 
subsequent data is presented to support 
an inference that the response was long- 
lasting. Additionally, given that the 
finding is based on video images, the 
lack of recorded fish presence does not 
support a conclusion that the fish 
actually moved away from the site or 
suffered any serious impairment. In 
summary, this particular study 
corroborates prior studies indicating 
that a startle response or short-term 
displacement should be expected. 
Available data suggest that 
cephalopods are capable of sensing the 
particle motion of sounds and detect 
low frequencies up to 1–1.5 kHz, 
depending on the species, and so are 
likely to detect airgun noise (Kaifu et al., 
2008; Hu et al., 2009; Mooney et al., 
2010; Samson et al., 2014). Auditory 
injuries (lesions occurring on the 
statocyst sensory hair cells) have been 
reported upon controlled exposure to 
low-frequency sounds, suggesting that 
cephalopods are particularly sensitive to 
low-frequency sound (Andre´et al., 
2011; Sole´et al., 2013). Behavioral 
responses, such as inking and jetting, 
have also been reported upon exposure 
to low-frequency sound (McCauley et 
al., 2000b; Samson et al., 2014). Similar to fish, however, the transient nature of 
the survey leads to an expectation that 
effects will be largely limited to 
behavioral reactions and would occur as 
a result of brief, infrequent exposures. 
With regard to potential impacts on 
zooplankton, McCauley et al. (2017) 
found that exposure to airgun noise 
resulted in significant depletion for 
more than half the taxa present and that 
there were two to three times more dead 
zooplankton after airgun exposure 
compared with controls for all taxa, 
within 1 km of the airguns. However, 
the authors also stated that in order to 
have significant impacts on r-selected 
species (i.e., those with high growth rates and that produce many offspring) 
such as plankton, the spatial or 
temporal scale of impact must be large 
in comparison with the ecosystem 
concerned, and it is possible that the 
findings reflect avoidance by 
zooplankton rather than mortality 
(McCauley et al., 2017). In addition, the results of this study are inconsistent 
with a large body of research that 
generally finds limited spatial and 
temporal impacts to zooplankton as a 
result of exposure to airgun noise (e.g., 
Dalen and Knutsen, 1987; Payne, 2004; 
Stanley et al., 2011). Most prior research on this topic, which has focused on 
relatively small spatial scales, has 
showed minimal effects (e.g., 
Kostyuchenko, 1973; Booman et al., 
1996; S#tre and Ona, 1996; Pearson et 
al., 1994; Bolle et al., 2012). A modeling exercise was conducted 
as a follow-up to the McCauley et al. 
(2017) study (as recommended by 
McCauley et al.), in order to assess the potential for impacts on ocean 
ecosystem dynamics and zooplankton 
population dynamics (Richardson et al., 
2017). Richardson et al. (2017) found 
that for copepods with a short life cycle 
in a high-energy environment, a full- 
scale airgun survey would impact 
copepod abundance up to 3 days 
following the end of the survey, 
suggesting that effects such as those 
found by McCauley et al. (2017) would 
not be expected to be detectable 
downstream of the survey areas, either 
spatially or temporally. 
Notably, a more recently described 
study produced results inconsistent 
with those of McCauley et al. (2017). 
Researchers conducted a field and 
laboratory study to assess if exposure to 
airgun noise affects mortality, predator 
escape response, or gene expression of 
the copepod Calanus finmarchicus 
(Fields et al., 2019). Immediate mortality of copepods was significantly 
higher, relative to controls, at distances 
of 5 m or less from the airguns. 
Mortality 1 week after the airgun blast 
was significantly higher in the copepods 
placed 10 m from the airgun but was not 
significantly different from the controls 
at a distance of 20 m from the airgun. 
The increase in mortality, relative to 
controls, did not exceed 30 percent at 
any distance from the airgun. Moreover, 
the authors caution that even this higher 
mortality in the immediate vicinity of 
the airguns may be more pronounced 
than what would be observed in free- 
swimming animals due to increased 
flow speed of fluid inside bags 
containing the experimental animals. 
There were no sublethal effects on the 
escape performance or the sensory 
threshold needed to initiate an escape 
response at any of the distances from 
the airgun that were tested. Whereas 
McCauley et al. (2017) reported an SEL of 156 dB at a range of 509–658 m, with 
zooplankton mortality observed at that 
range, Fields et al. (2019) reported an 
SEL of 186 dB at a range of 25 m, with 
no reported mortality at that distance. 
Regardless, if we assume a worst-case 
likelihood of severe impacts to 
zooplankton within approximately 1 km 
of the acoustic source, the brief time to 
regeneration of the potentially affected 
zooplankton populations does not lead 
us to expect any meaningful follow-on 
effects to the prey base for marine 
mammals. 
A review article concluded that, while 
laboratory results provide scientific 
evidence for high-intensity and low- 
frequency sound-induced physical 
trauma and other negative effects on 
some fish and invertebrates, the sound 
exposure scenarios in some cases are 
not realistic to those encountered by 
marine organisms during routine 
seismic operations (Carroll et al., 2017). 
The review finds that there has been no 
evidence of reduced catch or abundance 
following seismic activities for 
invertebrates, and that there is 
conflicting evidence for fish with catch 
observed to increase, decrease, or 
remain the same. Further, where there is 
evidence for decreased catch rates in 
response to airgun noise, these findings 
provide no information about the 
underlying biological cause of catch rate 
reduction (Carroll et al., 2017). 
In summary, impacts of the specified 
activity on marine mammal prey species 
will likely generally be limited to 
behavioral responses, the majority of 
prey species will be capable of moving 
out of the area during the survey, a 
rapid return to normal recruitment, 
distribution, and behavior for prey 
species is anticipated, and, overall, 
impacts to prey species will be minor 
and temporary. Prey species exposed to 
sound might move away from the sound

Mortality from decompression injuries 
is possible in close proximity to a 
sound, but only limited data on 
mortality in response to airgun noise 
exposure are available (Hawkins et al., 
2014). The most likely impacts for most 
prey species in the survey area would be 
temporary avoidance of the area. The 
proposed survey would move through 
an area relatively quickly, limiting 
exposure to multiple impulsive sounds. 
In all cases, sound levels would return 
to ambient once the survey moves out 
of the area or ends and the noise source 
is shut down and, when exposure to 
sound ends, behavioral and/or 
physiological responses are expected to 
end relatively quickly (McCauley et al., 
2000). The duration of fish avoidance of 
a given area after survey effort stops is 
unknown, but a rapid return to normal 
recruitment, distribution, and behavior 
is anticipated. While the potential for 
disruption of spawning aggregations or 
schools of important prey species can be 
meaningful on a local scale, the mobile 
and temporary nature of this survey and 
the likelihood of temporary avoidance 
behavior suggest that impacts would be 
minor. 
Acoustic Habitat—Acoustic habitat is 
the soundscape—which encompasses 
all of the sound present in a particular 
location and time, as a whole—when 
considered from the perspective of the 
animals experiencing it. Animals 
produce sound for, or listen for sounds 
produced by, conspecifics 
(communication during feeding, mating, 
and other social activities), other 
animals (finding prey or avoiding 
predators), and the physical 
environment (finding suitable habitats, 
navigating). Together, sounds made by 
animals and the geophysical 
environment (e.g., produced by earthquakes, lightning, wind, rain, 
waves) make up the natural 
contributions to the total acoustics of a 
place. These acoustic conditions, 
termed acoustic habitat, are one 
attribute of an animal’s total habitat. 
Soundscapes are also defined by, and 
acoustic habitat influenced by, the total 
contribution of anthropogenic sound. 
This may include incidental emissions 
from sources such as vessel traffic, or 
may be intentionally introduced to the 
marine environment for data acquisition 
purposes (as in the use of airgun arrays). 
Anthropogenic noise varies widely in its 
frequency content, duration, and 
loudness and these characteristics 
greatly influence the potential habitat- 
mediated effects to marine mammals 
(please see also the previous discussion 
on masking under Acoustic Effects), 
which may range from local effects for 
brief periods of time to chronic effects 
over large areas and for long durations. 
Depending on the extent of effects to 
habitat, animals may alter their 
communications signals (thereby 
potentially expending additional 
energy) or miss acoustic cues (either 
conspecific or adventitious). For more 
detail on these concepts see, e.g., Barber et al., 2010; Pijanowski et al., 2011; 
Francis and Barber, 2013; Lillis et al., 
2014. 
Problems arising from a failure to 
detect cues are more likely to occur 
when noise stimuli are chronic and 
overlap with biologically relevant cues 
used for communication, orientation, 
and predator/prey detection (Francis 
and Barber, 2013). Although the signals 
emitted by seismic airgun arrays are 
generally low frequency, they would 
also likely be of short duration and 
transient in any given area due to the 
nature of these surveys. As described 
previously, exploratory surveys such as 
these cover a large area but would be 
transient rather than focused in a given 
location over time and therefore would 
not be considered chronic in any given 
location. 
Based on the information discussed 
herein, we conclude that impacts of the 
specified activity are not likely to have 
more than short-term adverse effects on 
any prey habitat or populations of prey 
species. Further, any impacts to marine 
mammal habitat are not expected to 
result in significant or long-term 
consequences for individual marine 
mammals, or to contribute to adverse 
impacts on their populations. 
Estimated Take of Marine Mammals 
This section provides an estimate of 
the number of incidental takes proposed 
for authorization through the IHA, 
which will inform NMFS’ consideration 
of ‘‘small numbers,’’ and the negligible 
impact determinations. 
Harassment is the only type of take 
expected to result from these activities. 
Except with respect to certain activities 
not pertinent here, section 3(18) of the 
MMPA defines ‘‘harassment’’ as any act 
of pursuit, torment, or annoyance, 
which (i) has the potential to injure a 
marine mammal or marine mammal 
stock in the wild (Level A harassment); 
or (ii) has the potential to disturb a 
marine mammal or marine mammal 
stock in the wild by causing disruption 
of behavioral patterns, including, but 
not limited to, migration, breathing, 
nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering 
(Level B harassment). 
Authorized takes would be by Level B 
harassment only, in the form of 
behavioral reactions and/or TTS, for 
individual marine mammals resulting 
from exposure to noise from the use of 
seismic airguns. Based on the nature of 
the activity and the anticipated 
effectiveness of the mitigation measures 
(i.e., shutdown) discussed in detail below in the Proposed Mitigation 
section, Level A harassment is neither 
anticipated nor proposed to be 
authorized. As described previously, no 
serious injury or mortality is anticipated 
or proposed to be authorized for this 
activity. Below we describe how the 
proposed take numbers are estimated. 
For acoustic impacts, generally 
speaking, we estimate take by 
considering: (1) acoustic criteria above 
which NMFS believes there is some 
reasonable potential for marine 
mammals to be behaviorally harassed or 
incur some degree of AUD INJ; (2) the 
area or volume of water that will be 
ensonified above these levels in a day; 
(3) the density or occurrence of marine 
mammals within these ensonified areas; 
and, (4) the number of days of activities. 
We note that while these factors can 
contribute to a basic calculation to 
provide an initial prediction of potential 
takes, additional information that can 
qualitatively inform take estimates is 
also sometimes available (e.g., previous monitoring results or average group 
size). Below, we describe the factors 
considered here in more detail and 
present the proposed take estimates. 
Acoustic Criteria 
NMFS recommends the use of 
acoustic criteria that identify the 
received level of underwater sound 
above which exposed marine mammals 
would be reasonably expected to be 
behaviorally harassed (equated to Level 
B harassment) or to incur AUD INJ of 
some degree (equated to Level A 
harassment). We note that the criteria 
for AUD INJ, as well as the names of two 
hearing groups, have been recently 
updated (NMFS 2024) as reflected 
below in the Level A harassment 
section. 
Level B Harassment—Though 
significantly driven by received level, 
the onset of behavioral disturbance from 
anthropogenic noise exposure is also 
informed to varying degrees by other 
factors related to the source or exposure 
context (e.g., frequency, predictability, duty cycle, duration of the exposure, 
signal-to-noise ratio, distance to the 
source), the environment (e.g., 
bathymetry, other noises in the area, 
predators in the area), and the receiving 
animals (hearing, motivation, 
experience, demography, life stage, 
depth) and can be difficult to predict 
(e.g., Southall et al., 2007, 2021, Ellison VerDate Sep<11>2014  21:00 Dec 17, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\18DEN2.SGM 18DEN2
lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259349 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices et al., 2012). Based on what the 
available science indicates and the 
practical need to use a threshold based 
on a metric that is both predictable and 
measurable for most activities, NMFS 
typically uses a generalized acoustic 
threshold based on received level to 
estimate the onset of behavioral 
harassment. NMFS generally predicts 
that marine mammals are likely to be 
behaviorally harassed in a manner 
considered to be Level B harassment 
when exposed to underwater 
anthropogenic noise above root-mean- 
squared pressure received levels (RMS 
SPL) of 120 dB (referenced to 1 
micropascal (re 1 mPa)) for continuous 
(e.g., vibratory pile driving, drilling) and above RMS SPL 160 dB re 1 mPa for non- 
explosive impulsive (e.g., seismic airguns) or intermittent (e.g., scientific sonar) sources. Generally speaking, 
Level B harassment take estimates based 
on these behavioral harassment 
thresholds are expected to include any 
likely takes by TTS as, in most cases, 
the likelihood of TTS occurs at 
distances from the source less than 
those at which behavioral harassment is 
likely. TTS of a sufficient degree can 
manifest as behavioral harassment, as 
reduced hearing sensitivity and the 
potential reduced opportunities to 
detect important signals (conspecific 
communication, predators, prey) may 
result in changes in behavior patterns 
that would not otherwise occur. L– 
DEO’s proposed activity includes the 
use of impulsive seismic sources (i.e., 
airguns), and therefore the RMS SPL 
thresholds of 160 dB re 1 mPa is 
applicable. 
Level A Harassment—NMFS’ Updated 
Technical Guidance for Assessing the 
Effects of Anthropogenic Sound on 
Marine Mammal Hearing (Version 3.0) 
(NMFS, 2024) identifies dual criteria to 
assess AUD INJ (Level A harassment) to 
five different underwater marine 
mammal groups (based on hearing 
sensitivity) as a result of exposure to 
noise from two different types of 
sources (impulsive or non-impulsive). 
L–DEO’s proposed activity includes the 
use of impulsive seismic sources (i.e., 
airguns). 
The 2024 Updated Technical 
Guidance criteria include both updated 
thresholds and updated weighting 
functions for each hearing group. The 
thresholds are provided in the table 
below. The references, analysis, and 
methodology used in the development 
of the criteria are described in NMFS’ 
2024 Updated Technical Guidance, 
which may be accessed at: https://

sound has the potential of exceeding the peak sound pressure level criteria associated with impulsive sounds, the PK SPL criteria are rec-
ommended for consideration for non-impulsive sources. 
Note: Peak sound pressure level (Lp,0-pk
) has a reference value of 1 µPa, and weighted cumulative sound exposure level (LE,p
) has a ref-
erence value of 1 µPa
2
s. In this table, criteria are abbreviated to be more reflective of International Organization for Standardization standards 
(ISO 2017). The subscript ‘‘flat’’ is being included to indicate peak sound pressure are flat weighted or unweighted within the generalized hearing 
range of marine mammals underwater (i.e., 7 Hz to 165 kHz). The subscript associated with cumulative sound exposure level criteria indicates the designated marine mammal auditory weighting function (LF, HF, and VHF cetaceans, and PW and OW pinnipeds) and that the rec-
ommended accumulation period is 24 hours. The weighted cumulative sound exposure level criteria could be exceeded in a multitude of ways 
(i.e., varying exposure levels and durations, duty cycle). When possible, it is valuable for action proponents to indicate the conditions under which these criteria will be exceeded. 
Ensonified Area 
Here, we describe operational and 
environmental parameters of the activity 
that are used in estimating the area 
ensonified above the acoustic 
thresholds, including source levels and 
transmission loss coefficient. 
The ensonified area associated with 
Level A harassment is more technically 
challenging to predict due to the need 
to account for a duration component. 
Therefore, NMFS developed an optional 
User Spreadsheet tool to accompany the 
2024 Updated Technical Guidance that 
can be used to relatively simply predict 
an isopleth distance for use in 
conjunction with marine mammal 
density or occurrence to help predict 
potential takes. We note that because of 
some of the assumptions included in the 
methods underlying this optional tool, 
we anticipate that the resulting isopleth 
estimates are typically going to be 
overestimates of some degree, which 
may result in an overestimate of 
potential take by Level A harassment. 
However, this optional tool offers the 
best way to estimate isopleth distances 
when more sophisticated modeling 
methods are not available or practical. 
The proposed survey would entail the 
use of a cluster of 2 18-airgun array with 
a total discharge volume of 3,300 in
3
at 
a tow depth of 7.5 m. L–DEO model 
results are used to determine the 160 dB 
RMS radius for the airgun source down 
to a maximum depth of 2,000 m. 
Received sound levels have been 
predicted by L–DEO’s model (Diebold et 
al., 2010) as a function of distance from the airgun array. This modeling 
approach uses ray tracing for the direct 
wave traveling from the array to the 
receiver and its associated source ghost 
(reflection at the air-water interface in 
the vicinity of the array), in a constant- 
velocity half-space (infinite 
homogeneous ocean layer, unbounded 
by a seafloor). In addition, propagation 
measurements of pulses from the 36- 
airgun array at a tow depth of 6 m have 
been reported in deep water (1,600 m), 
intermediate water depth on the slope 
(600–1,100 m), and shallow water (50 
m) in the Gulf of America (previously 
Gulf of Mexico) (Tolstoy et al., 2009; 
Diebold et al., 2010). For deep and intermediate water 
cases, the field measurements cannot be 
used readily to derive the harassment 
isopleths, as at those sites the 
calibration hydrophone was located at a 
roughly constant depth of 350–550 m, 
which may not intersect all the SPL 
isopleths at their widest point from the

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259350 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices sea surface down to the assumed 
maximum relevant water depth (2,000 
m) for marine mammals. At short 
ranges, where the direct arrivals 
dominate and the effects of seafloor 
interactions are minimal, the data at the 
deep sites are suitable for comparison 
with modeled levels at the depth of the 
calibration hydrophone. At longer 
ranges, the comparison with the 
model—constructed from the maximum 
SPL through the entire water column at 
varying distances from the airgun 
array—is the most relevant. 
In deep and intermediate water 
depths at short ranges, sound levels for 
direct arrivals recorded by the 
calibration hydrophone and L–DEO 
model results for the same array tow 
depth are in good alignment (see figures 
12 and 14 in Diebold et al., 2010). 
Consequently, isopleths falling within 
this domain can be predicted reliably by 
the L–DEO model, although they may be 
imperfectly sampled by measurements 
recorded at a single depth. At greater 
distances, the calibration data show that 
seafloor-reflected and sub-seafloor- 
refracted arrivals dominate, whereas the 
direct arrivals become weak and/or 
incoherent (see figures 11, 12, and 16 in 
Diebold et al., 2010). Aside from local topography effects, the region around 
the critical distance is where the 
observed levels rise closest to the model 
curve. However, the observed sound 
levels are found to fall almost entirely 
below the model curve. Thus, analysis 
of the Gulf of America calibration 
measurements demonstrates that 
although simple, the L–DEO model is a 
robust tool for conservatively estimating 
isopleths. 
The proposed geophysical survey 
would acquire data with the 18-airgun 
array at a tow depth of 7.5 m. For deep 
water (>1,000 m), we use the deep-water 
radii obtained from the L–DEO model 
results down to a maximum water depth 
of 2,000 m for the airgun array. 
L–DEO’s modeling methodology is 
described in greater detail in their 
application. The estimated distances to 
the Level B harassment isopleth for the 
proposed airgun configuration are 
shown in table 4.

Table 5 presents the modeled Level A 
harassment isopleths for each marine 
mammal hearing group based on L–DEO 
modeling incorporated in the 
companion user spreadsheet, for the 
low-energy surveys with the shortest 
shot interval (i.e., greatest potential to cause PTS based on accumulated sound 
energy) (NMFS 2018, 2024). 
Predicted distances to Level A 
harassment isopleths, which vary based 
on marine mammal hearing groups, 
were calculated based on modeling 
performed by L–DEO using the Nucleus 
software program and the NMFS user 
spreadsheet, described below. The 
acoustic thresholds for impulsive 
sounds contained in the NMFS 
Technical Guidance were presented as 
dual metric acoustic thresholds using 
both SEL
cum
and peak sound pressure 
metrics (NMFS, 2016). As dual metrics, 
NMFS considers onset of PTS (Level A 
harassment) to have occurred when 
either one of the two metrics is 
exceeded (i.e., metric resulting in the largest isopleth). The SEL
cum
metric 
considers both level and duration of 
exposure, as well as auditory weighting 
functions by marine mammal hearing 
group. 
The SEL
cum
for the 18-airgun array is 
derived from calculating the modified 
farfield signature. The farfield signature 
is often used as a theoretical 
representation of the source level. To 
compute the farfield signature, the 
source level is estimated at a large 
distance (right) below the array (e.g., 9 km), and this level is back projected 
mathematically to a notional distance of 
1 m from the array’s geometrical center. 
However, it has been recognized that the 
source level from the theoretical farfield 
signature is never physically achieved at 
the source when the source is an array 
of multiple airguns separated in space 
(Tolstoy et al., 2009). Near the source (at short ranges, distances <1 km), the 
pulses of sound pressure from each 
individual airgun in the source array do 
not stack constructively as they do for 
the theoretical farfield signature. The 
pulses from the different airguns spread 
out in time such that the source levels 
observed or modeled are the result of 
the summation of pulses from a few 
airguns, not the full array (Tolstoy et al., 
2009). At larger distances, away from 
the source array center, sound pressure 
of all the airguns in the array stack 
coherently, but not within one time 
sample, resulting in smaller source 
levels (a few dB) than the source level 
derived from the farfield signature. 
Because the farfield signature does not 
take into account the large array effect 
near the source and is calculated as a 
point source, the farfield signature is not 
an appropriate measure of the sound 
source level for large arrays. See L– 
DEO’s application for further detail on 
acoustic modeling. 
In consideration of the received sound 
levels in the near-field as described 
above, we expect the potential for Level 
A harassment of any species to be de 
minimis, even before the likely

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259351 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices moderating effects of aversion and/or 
other compensatory behaviors (e.g., 
Nachtigall et al., 2018) are considered. We do not anticipate that auditory 
injury or Level A harassment is a likely 
outcome for any species and do not 
propose to authorize any take by Level 
A harassment for any species, given the 
small modeled zones of injury for those 
species (estimated zones are less than 
165 m for all species), in context of 
distributed source dynamics. 
The Level B harassment estimates are 
based on a consideration of the number 
of marine mammals that could be 
within the area around the operating 
airgun array where received levels of 
sound 160 dB re 1 mPa RMS are predicted to occur. The estimated 
numbers are based on the densities 
(numbers per unit area) of marine 
mammals expected to occur in the area 
in the absence of seismic surveys. To 
the extent that marine mammals tend to 
move away from seismic sources before 
the sound level reaches the criterion 
level and tend not to approach an 
operating airgun array, these estimates 
likely overestimate the numbers actually 
exposed to the specified level of sound. 
Marine Mammal Occurrence 
In this section we provide information 
about the occurrence of marine 
mammals, including density or other 
relevant information which will inform 
the take calculations. 
L–DEO used habitat-based stratified 
marine mammal densities for summer 
(July–December) for the ETP when 
available (Barlow et al., 2009), and 
densities for the ETP from Gerrodette et 
al. (2008) for all other species (See table 3 in L–DEO’s application). Barlow et al. 
(2009) used data from 16 NMFS 
Southwest Fisheries Science Center 
(SWFSC) ship-based cetacean and 
ecosystem assessment surveys between 
1986 and 2006 to develop habitat 
models to predict density for 15 
cetacean species in the ETP. Model 
predictions were then used in standard 
line-transect formulae to estimate 
density for each transect segment for 
each survey year. Predicted densities for 
each year were smoothed with 
geospatial methods to obtain a 
continuous grid of density estimates for 
the surveyed area in the ETP. These 
annual grids were then averaged to 
obtain a composite grid that represents 
our best estimates of cetacean density 
over the past 20 years in the ETP. The 
models developed by Barlow et al. 
(2009) have been incorporated into a 
web-based geographic information 
system (GIS) software system developed 
by Duke University’s Strategic 
Environmental Research and 
Development Program. The habitat- 
based density models consist of 100 km 
x 100 km grid cells. Densities in the grid 
cells that overlapped the survey area 
were averaged for each of the three 
water depth categories (shallow, 
intermediate, deep). 
The NMFS SWFSC also developed 
density estimates for species in the ETP 
that may be affected by their own 
fisheries research activities (NMFS 
2015a). These estimates were derived 
from abundance estimates using ship- 
based surveys of marine mammals in 
the ETP, as reported by Gerrodette et al. 
(2008). While the SWFSC developed 
volumetric density estimates (animals/ 
km
3
) to account for typical dive depth 
of each species (0–200 m and >200 m), 
L–DEO used the area density (animals/ 
km

) to represent expected density 
across all water depth strata. 
For the sei whale, for which 
Gerrodette et al. (2008) reported a density of zero, L–DEO used the spring 
density for Baja from U.S. Navy (2024). 
This was done because even though 
there is a modeled density of zero, we 
do expect there is some potential for sei 
whale to be in the project area during 
the proposed survey. No densities were 
available for Blainville’s beaked whale, 
ginkgo-toothed beaked whale, 
Deraniyagala’s beaked whale, or pygmy 
beaked whale so density for 
Mesoplodon species was used. 
Take Estimation 
Here we describe how the information 
provided above is synthesized to 
produce a quantitative estimate of the 
take that is reasonably likely to occur 
and proposed for authorization. 
In order to estimate the number of 
marine mammals predicted to be 
exposed to sound levels that would 
result in Level A or Level B harassment, 
radial distances from the airgun array to 
the predicted isopleth corresponding to 
the Level A harassment and Level B 
harassment thresholds are calculated, as 
described above. Those radial distances 
were then used to calculate the area(s) 
around the airgun array predicted to be 
ensonified to sound levels that exceed 
the harassment thresholds. The distance 
for the 160-dB Level B harassment 
threshold and auditory injury (Level A 
harassment) thresholds (based on L– 
DEO model results) was used to draw a 
buffer around the area expected to be 
ensonified (i.e., the survey area). The ensonified areas were then increased by 
25 percent to account for potential 
delays, which is equivalent to adding 25 
percent to the proposed line km to be 
surveyed. The density for each species 
was then multiplied by the daily 
ensonified areas (increased as described 
above) and then multiplied by the 
number of survey days (seven) to 
estimate potential takes (see appendix B 
of L–DEO’s application for more 
information). 
L–DEO assumed that their estimates 
of marine mammal exposures above 
harassment thresholds equate to take 
and requested authorization of those 
takes. Those estimates in turn form the 
basis for our proposed take 
authorization numbers. Based on the 
nature of the activity and due to the 
unlikelihood of the calculated Level A 
harassment exposures because of the 
small Level A harassment zones (158 m 
for LF and <15 m for HF species) and 
the need for individuals to stay in the 
Level A harassment zone for 24-hours to 
incur AUD INJ, Level A harassment is 
neither anticipated nor proposed to be 
authorized. For some species (LF and 
HF) we have added L–DEO’s estimated 
exposures above Level A harassment 
thresholds to their estimated exposures 
above the Level B harassment threshold 
to produce a total number of incidents 
of take by Level B harassment that is 
proposed for authorization. 
Additionally, for three species (minke 
whale, fin whale, and Kogia spp) there 
are zero calculated takes. NMFS 
proposes to authorize a group size given 
observations reported during a previous 
survey in the project area in 2022 (RPS 
2022) and based on sightings in the 
OBIS database for the waters in and 
adjacent to the proposed study area 
(OBIS 2025). Estimated exposures and 
proposed take numbers for 
authorization are shown in table 6.

Proposed Mitigation 
In order to issue an IHA under section 
101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA, NMFS must 
set forth the permissible methods of 
taking pursuant to the activity, and 
other means of effecting the least 
practicable impact on the species or 
stock and its habitat, paying particular 
attention to rookeries, mating grounds, 
and areas of similar significance, and on 
the availability of the species or stock 
for taking for certain subsistence uses 
(latter not applicable for this action). 
NMFS regulations require applicants for 
incidental take authorizations to include 
information about the availability and 
feasibility (economic and technological) 
of equipment, methods, and manner of 
conducting the activity or other means 
of effecting the least practicable adverse 
impact upon the affected species or 
stocks, and their habitat (50 CFR 
216.104(a)(11)). 
In evaluating how mitigation may or 
may not be appropriate to ensure the 
least practicable adverse impact on 
species or stocks and their habitat, as 
well as subsistence uses where 
applicable, NMFS considers two 
primary factors: 
(1) The manner in which, and the 
degree to which, the successful 
implementation of the measure(s) is 
expected to reduce impacts to marine 
mammals, marine mammal species or 
stocks, and their habitat. This considers 
the nature of the potential adverse 
impact being mitigated (likelihood, 
scope, range). It further considers the 
likelihood that the measure will be 
effective if implemented (probability of 
accomplishing the mitigating result if 
implemented as planned), the 
likelihood of effective implementation 
(probability implemented as planned), 
and; 
(2) The practicability of the measures 
for applicant implementation, which 
may consider such things as cost, and 
impact on operations. 
The proposed mitigation requirements 
described in the following were 
proposed by L–DEO in its adequate and 
complete application or are the result of 
subsequent coordination between NMFS 
and L–DEO. L–DEO has agreed that all 
of the mitigation measures are 
practicable. NMFS has fully reviewed 
the specified activities and the 
mitigation measures to determine if the 
mitigation measures would result in the 
least practicable adverse impact on 
marine mammals and their habitat, as 
required by the MMPA, and has 
determined the proposed measures are 
appropriate. NMFS describes these 
below as proposed mitigation 
requirements, and has included them in 
the proposed IHA. 
Vessel-Based Visual Mitigation 
Monitoring 
Visual monitoring requires the use of 
trained observers (herein referred to as 
visual protected species observers 
(PSOs)) to scan the ocean surface for the 
presence of marine mammals. The area 
to be scanned visually includes 
primarily the shutdown zone (SZ), 
within which observation of certain 
marine mammals requires shutdown of 
the acoustic source, a buffer zone, and 
to the extent possible depending on 
conditions, the surrounding waters. The 
buffer zone means an area beyond the 
SZ to be monitored for the presence of 
marine mammals that may enter the SZ. 
During pre-start clearance monitoring 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  21:00 Dec 17, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\18DEN2.SGM 18DEN2
lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259353 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices (i.e., before ramp-up begins), the buffer zone also acts as an extension of the SZ 
in that observations of marine mammals 
within the buffer zone would also 
prevent airgun operations from 
beginning (i.e., ramp-up). The buffer zone encompasses the area at and below 
the sea surface from the edge of the 0– 
500 m SZ, out to a radius of 1,000 m 
from the edges of the airgun array (500– 
1,000 m). This 1,000-m zone (SZ plus 
buffer) represents the pre-start clearance 
zone. Visual monitoring of the SZ and 
adjacent waters (buffer plus surrounding 
waters) is intended to establish and, 
when visual conditions allow, maintain 
zones around the sound source that are 
clear of marine mammals, thereby 
reducing or eliminating the potential for 
injury and minimizing the potential for 
more severe behavioral reactions for 
animals occurring closer to the vessel. 
Visual monitoring of the buffer zone is 
intended to (1) provide additional 
protection to marine mammals that may 
be in the vicinity of the vessel during 
pre-start clearance, and (2) during 
airgun use, aid in establishing and 
maintaining the SZ by alerting the 
visual observer and crew of marine 
mammals that are outside of, but may 
approach and enter, the SZ. 
During survey operations (e.g., any day on which use of the airgun array is 
planned to occur and whenever the 
airgun array is in the water, whether 
activated or not), a minimum of two 
visual PSOs must be on duty and 
conducting visual observations at all 
times during daylight hours (i.e., from 30 minutes prior to sunrise through 30 
minutes following sunset). Visual 
monitoring of the pre-start clearance 
zone must begin no less than 30 minutes 
prior to ramp-up and monitoring must 
continue until 1 hour after use of the 
airgun array ceases or until 30 minutes 
past sunset. Visual PSOs shall 
coordinate to ensure 360° visual coverage around the vessel from the 
most appropriate observation posts and 
shall conduct visual observations using 
binoculars and the naked eye while free 
from distractions and in a consistent, 
systematic, and diligent manner. 
PSOs shall establish and monitor the 
SZ and buffer zone. These zones shall 
be based upon the radial distance from 
the edges of the airgun array (rather than 
being based on the center of the array 
or around the vessel itself). During use 
of the airgun array (i.e., anytime airguns are active, including ramp-up), 
detections of marine mammals within 
the buffer zone (but outside the SZ) 
shall be communicated to the operator 
to prepare for the potential shutdown of 
the airgun array. Visual PSOs will 
immediately communicate all 
observations to the on duty acoustic 
PSO(s), including any determination by 
the visual PSO regarding species 
identification, distance, and bearing and 
the degree of confidence in the 
determination. Any observations of 
marine mammals by crew members 
shall be relayed to the PSO team. During 
good conditions (e.g., daylight hours; Beaufort sea state (BSS) 3 or less), visual 
PSOs shall conduct observations when 
the airgun array is not operating for 
comparison of sighting rates and 
behavior with and without use of the 
airgun array and between acquisition 
periods, to the maximum extent 
practicable. 
Visual PSOs may be on watch for a 
maximum of 4 consecutive hours 
followed by a break of at least 1 hour 
between watches and may conduct a 
maximum of 12 hours of observation per 
24-hour period. Combined observational 
duties (visual and acoustic but not at 
same time) may not exceed 12 hours per 
24-hour period for any individual PSO. 
Passive Acoustic Monitoring 
Passive acoustic monitoring means 
the use of trained personnel (sometimes 
referred to as PAM operators, herein 
referred to as acoustic PSOs) to operate 
PAM equipment to acoustically detect 
the presence of marine mammals. 
Acoustic monitoring involves 
acoustically detecting marine mammals 
regardless of distance from the source, 
as localization of animals may not 
always be possible. Acoustic monitoring 
is intended to further support visual 
monitoring (during daylight hours) in 
maintaining a SZ around the sound 
source that is clear of marine mammals. 
In cases where visual monitoring is not 
effective (e.g., due to weather, nighttime), acoustic monitoring may be 
used to allow certain activities to occur, 
as further detailed below. 
PAM would take place in addition to 
the visual monitoring program. Visual 
monitoring typically is not effective 
during periods of poor visibility or at 
night and even with good visibility, is 
unable to detect marine mammals when 
they are below the surface or beyond 
visual range. Acoustic monitoring can 
be used in addition to visual 
observations to improve detection, 
identification, and localization of 
cetaceans. The acoustic monitoring 
would serve to alert visual PSOs (if on 
duty) when vocalizing cetaceans are 
detected. It is only useful when marine 
mammals vocalize, but it can be 
effective either by day or by night and 
does not depend on good visibility. It 
would be monitored in real time so that 
the visual observers can be advised 
when cetaceans are detected. 
The Langseth will use a towed PAM system, which must be monitored by at 
a minimum one on duty acoustic PSO 
beginning at least 30 minutes prior to 
ramp-up and at all times during use of 
the airgun array. Acoustic PSOs may be 
on watch for a maximum of 4 
consecutive hours followed by a break 
of at least 1 hour between watches and 
may conduct a maximum of 12 hours of 
observation per 24-hour period. 
Combined observational duties (acoustic 
and visual but not at same time) may 
not exceed 12 hours per 24-hour period 
for any individual PSO. 
Survey activity may continue for 30 
minutes when the PAM system 
malfunctions or is damaged, while the 
PAM operator diagnoses the issue. If the 
diagnosis indicates that the PAM system 
must be repaired to solve the problem, 
operations may continue for an 
additional 10 hours without acoustic 
monitoring during daylight hours only 
under the following conditions: 
€Sea state is less than or equal to BSS 4; 
€No marine mammals (excluding delphinids) detected solely by PAM in 
the SZ in the previous 2 hours; 
€NMFS is notified via email as soon as practicable with the time and 
location in which operations began 
occurring without an active PAM 
system; and 
€Operations with an active airgun array, but without an operating PAM 
system, do not exceed a cumulative total 
of 10 hours in any 24-hour period. 
Establishment of Shutdown and Pre- 
Start Clearance Zones 
A SZ is a defined area within which 
occurrence of a marine mammal triggers 
mitigation action intended to reduce the 
potential for certain outcomes (e.g., 
auditory injury, disruption of critical 
behaviors). The PSOs would establish a 
minimum SZ with a 500-m radius. The 
500-m SZ would be based on radial 
distance from the edge of the airgun 
array (rather than being based on the 
center of the array or around the vessel 
itself). With certain exceptions 
(described below), if a marine mammal 
appears within or enters this zone, the 
airgun array would be shut down. 
The pre-start clearance zone is 
defined as the area that must be clear of 
marine mammals prior to beginning 
ramp-up of the airgun array and 
includes the SZ plus the buffer zone. 
Detections of marine mammals within 
the pre-start clearance zone would 
prevent airgun operations from 
beginning (i.e., ramp-up). The 500-m SZ is intended to be 
precautionary in the sense that it would 
be expected to contain sound exceeding

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259354 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices the injury criteria for all cetacean 
hearing groups, (based on the dual 
criteria of SEL
cum
and peak SPL), while 
also providing a consistent, reasonably 
observable zone within which PSOs 
would typically be able to conduct 
effective observational effort. 
Additionally, a 500-m SZ is expected to 
minimize the likelihood that marine 
mammals will be exposed to levels 
likely to result in more severe 
behavioral responses. Although 
significantly greater distances may be 
observed from an elevated platform 
under good conditions, we expect that 
500 m is likely regularly attainable for 
PSOs using the naked eye during typical 
conditions. The pre-start clearance zone 
simply represents the addition of a 
buffer to the SZ, doubling the SZ size 
during pre-clearance. 
An extended SZ of 1,500 m must be 
enforced for all beaked whales, Kogia 
spp, a large whale with a calf, and 
groups of six or more large whales. No 
buffer of this extended SZ is required, 
as NMFS concludes that this extended 
SZ is sufficiently protective to mitigate 
harassment to these groups. 
Pre-Start Clearance and Ramp-Up 
Ramp-up (sometimes referred to as 
‘‘soft start’’) means the gradual and 
systematic increase of emitted sound 
levels from an airgun array. Ramp-up 
begins by first activating a single airgun 
of the smallest volume, followed by 
doubling the number of active elements 
in stages until the full complement of an 
array’s airguns are active. Each stage 
should be approximately the same 
duration, and the total duration should 
not be less than approximately 20 
minutes. The intent of pre-start 
clearance observation (30 minutes) is to 
ensure no marine mammals are 
observed within the pre-start clearance 
zone (or extended SZ, for beaked 
whales, Kogia spp, a large whale with a calf, and groups of six or more large 
whales) prior to the beginning of ramp- 
up. During the pre-start clearance period 
is the only time observations of marine 
mammals in the buffer zone would 
prevent operations (i.e., the beginning of ramp-up). The intent of the ramp-up is 
to warn marine mammals of pending 
seismic survey operations and to allow 
sufficient time for those animals to leave 
the immediate vicinity prior to the 
sound source reaching full intensity. A 
ramp-up procedure, involving a 
stepwise increase in the number of 
airguns firing and total array volume 
until all operational airguns are 
activated and the full volume is 
achieved, is required at all times as part 
of the activation of the airgun array. All 
operators must adhere to the following 
pre-start clearance and ramp-up 
requirements: 
€The operator must notify a designated PSO of the planned start of 
ramp-up as agreed upon with the lead 
PSO; the notification time should not be 
less than 60 minutes prior to the 
planned ramp-up in order to allow the 
PSOs time to monitor the pre-start 
clearance zone (and extended SZ) for 30 
minutes prior to the initiation of ramp- 
up (pre-start clearance); 
€Ramp-ups shall be scheduled so as to minimize the time spent with the 
source activated prior to reaching the 
designated run-in; 
€One of the PSOs conducting pre- start clearance observations must be 
notified again immediately prior to 
initiating ramp-up procedures and the 
operator must receive confirmation from 
the PSO to proceed; 
€Ramp-up may not be initiated if any marine mammal is within the applicable 
shutdown or buffer zone. If a marine 
mammal is observed within the pre-start 
clearance zone (or extended SZ, for 
beaked whales, a large whale with a 
calf, and groups of six or more large 
whales) during the 30 minute pre-start 
clearance period, ramp-up may not 
begin until the animal(s) has been 
observed exiting the zones or until an 
additional time period has elapsed with 
no further sightings (15 minutes for 
small odontocetes, and 30 minutes for 
all mysticetes and all other odontocetes, 
including sperm whales, beaked whales, 
and large delphinids); 
€Ramp-up shall begin by activating a single airgun of the smallest volume in 
the array and shall continue in stages by 
doubling the number of active elements 
at the commencement of each stage, 
with each stage of approximately the 
same duration. Duration shall not be 
less than 20 minutes. The operator must 
provide information to the PSO 
documenting that appropriate 
procedures were followed; 
€PSOs must monitor the pre-start clearance zone and extended SZ during 
ramp-up, and ramp-up must cease and 
the source must be shut down upon 
detection of a marine mammal within 
the applicable zone. Once ramp-up has 
begun, detections of marine mammals 
within the buffer zone do not require 
shutdown, but such observation shall be 
communicated to the operator to 
prepare for the potential shutdown; 
€Ramp-up may occur at times of poor visibility, including nighttime, if 
appropriate acoustic monitoring has 
occurred with no detections in the 30 
minutes prior to beginning ramp-up. 
Airgun array activation may only occur 
at times of poor visibility where 
operational planning cannot reasonably 
avoid such circumstances; 
€If the airgun array is shut down for brief periods (i.e., less than 30 minutes) for reasons other than implementation 
of prescribed mitigation (e.g., 
mechanical difficulty), it may be 
activated again without ramp-up if PSOs 
have maintained constant visual and/or 
acoustic observation and no visual or 
acoustic detections of marine mammals 
have occurred within the pre-start 
clearance zone (or extended SZ, where 
applicable). For any longer shutdown, 
pre-start clearance observation and 
ramp-up are required; and 
€Testing of the airgun array involving all elements requires ramp- 
up. Testing limited to individual source 
elements or strings does not require 
ramp-up but does require pre-start 
clearance watch of 30 minutes. 
Shutdown 
The shutdown of an airgun array 
requires the immediate de-activation of 
all individual airgun elements of the 
array. Any PSO on duty will have the 
authority to call for shutdown of the 
airgun array if a marine mammal is 
detected within the applicable SZ. The 
operator must also establish and 
maintain clear lines of communication 
directly between PSOs on duty and 
crew controlling the airgun array to 
ensure that shutdown commands are 
conveyed swiftly while allowing PSOs 
to maintain watch. When both visual 
and acoustic PSOs are on duty, all 
detections will be immediately 
communicated to the remainder of the 
on-duty PSO team for potential 
verification of visual observations by the 
acoustic PSO or of acoustic detections 
by visual PSOs. When the airgun array 
is active (i.e., anytime one or more airguns is active, including during 
ramp-up) and (1) a marine mammal 
appears within or enters the applicable 
SZ and/or (2) a marine mammal (other 
than delphinids, see below) is detected 
acoustically and localized within the 
applicable SZ, the airgun array will be 
shut down. When shutdown is called 
for by a PSO, the airgun array will be 
immediately deactivated and any 
dispute resolved only following 
deactivation. Additionally, shutdown 
will occur whenever PAM alone 
(without visual sighting), confirms the 
presence of marine mammal(s) in the 
SZ. If the acoustic PSO cannot confirm 
presence within the SZ, visual PSOs 
will be notified but shutdown is not 
required. 
Following a shutdown, airgun activity 
would not resume until the marine 
mammal has cleared the SZ. The animal 
would be considered to have cleared the

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259355 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices SZ if it is visually observed to have 
departed the SZ (i.e., animal is not required to fully exit the buffer zone 
where applicable), or it has not been 
seen within the SZ for 15 minutes for 
small odontocetes or 30 minutes for all 
mysticetes and all other odontocetes, 
including sperm whales, beaked whales, 
and large delphinids. 
The shutdown requirement is waived 
for specific genera of small dolphins if 
an individual is detected within the SZ. 
The small dolphin group is intended to 
encompass those members of the Family 
Delphinidae most likely to voluntarily 
approach the source vessel for purposes 
of interacting with the vessel and/or 
airgun array (e.g., bow riding). This exception to the shutdown requirement 
applies solely to the specific genera of 
small dolphins (Delphinus, 
Lagenodelphis, Stenella, Steno and 
Tursiops). 
We include this small dolphin 
exception because shutdown 
requirements for these species under all 
circumstances represent practicability 
concerns without likely commensurate 
benefits for the animals in question. 
Small dolphins are generally the most 
commonly observed marine mammals 
in the specific geographic region and 
would typically be the only marine 
mammals likely to intentionally 
approach the vessel. As described 
above, auditory injury is extremely 
unlikely to occur for high-frequency 
cetaceans (e.g., delphinids), as this group is relatively insensitive to sound 
produced at the predominant 
frequencies in an airgun pulse while 
also having a relatively high threshold 
for the onset of auditory injury (i.e., 
permanent threshold shift). 
A large body of anecdotal evidence 
indicates that small dolphins commonly 
approach vessels and/or towed arrays 
during active sound production for 
purposes of bow riding with no 
apparent effect observed (e.g., Barkaszi et al., 2012, Barkaszi and Kelly, 2018). 
The potential for increased shutdowns 
resulting from such a measure would 
require the Langseth to revisit the missed track line to reacquire data, 
resulting in an overall increase in the 
total sound energy input to the marine 
environment and an increase in the total 
duration over which the survey is active 
in a given area. Although other mid- 
frequency hearing specialists (e.g., large delphinids) are no more likely to incur 
auditory injury than are small dolphins, 
they are much less likely to approach 
vessels. Therefore, retaining a shutdown 
requirement for large delphinids would 
not have similar impacts in terms of 
either practicability for the applicant or 
corollary increase in sound energy 
output and time on the water. We do 
anticipate some benefit for a shutdown 
requirement for large delphinids in that 
it simplifies somewhat the total range of 
decision-making for PSOs and may 
preclude any potential for physiological 
effects other than to the auditory system 
as well as some more severe behavioral 
reactions for any such animals in close 
proximity to the Langseth. 
Visual PSOs shall use best 
professional judgment in making the 
decision to call for a shutdown if there 
is uncertainty regarding identification 
(i.e., whether the observed marine mammal(s) belongs to one of the 
delphinid genera for which shutdown is 
waived or one of the species with a 
larger SZ). 
L–DEO must implement shutdown if 
a marine mammal species for which 
take was not authorized or a species for 
which authorization was granted but the 
authorized takes have been met 
approaches the Level A or Level B 
harassment zones. L–DEO must also 
implement an extended shutdown of 
1,500 m if any large whale (defined as 
a sperm whale or any mysticete species) 
with a calf (defined as an animal less 
than two-thirds the body size of an adult 
observed to be in close association with 
an adult) and/or an aggregation of six or 
more large whales. 
Vessel Strike Avoidance Mitigation 
Measures 
Vessel personnel should use an 
appropriate reference guide that 
includes identifying information on all 
marine mammals that may be 
encountered. Vessel operators must 
comply with the below measures except 
under extraordinary circumstances 
when the safety of the vessel or crew is 
in doubt or the safety of life at sea is in 
question. These requirements do not 
apply in any case where compliance 
would create an imminent and serious 
threat to a person or vessel or to the 
extent that a vessel is restricted in its 
ability to maneuver and, because of the 
restriction, cannot comply. 
Vessel operators and crews must 
maintain a vigilant watch for all marine 
mammals and slow down, stop their 
vessel, or alter course, as appropriate 
and regardless of vessel size, to avoid 
striking any marine mammal. A single 
marine mammal at the surface may 
indicate the presence of submerged 
animals in the vicinity of the vessel; 
therefore, precautionary measures 
should always be exercised. A visual 
observer aboard the vessel must monitor 
a vessel strike avoidance zone around 
the vessel (separation distances stated 
below). Visual observers monitoring the 
vessel strike avoidance zone may be 
third-party observers (i.e., PSOs) or crew members, but crew members 
responsible for these duties must be 
provided sufficient training to (1) 
distinguish marine mammals from other 
phenomena and (2) broadly to identify 
a marine mammal as a large whale 
(defined in this context as sperm whales 
or baleen whales), or other marine 
mammals. 
Vessel speeds must be reduced to 10 
kn (18.5 kph) or less when mother/calf 
pairs, pods, or large assemblages of 
cetaceans are observed near a vessel. All 
vessels must maintain a minimum 
separation distance of 100 m from 
sperm whales and all other baleen 
whales. All vessels must, to the 
maximum extent practicable, attempt to 
maintain a minimum separation 
distance of 50 m from all other marine 
mammals, with an understanding that at 
times this may not be possible (e.g., for animals that approach the vessel). 
When marine mammals are sighted 
while a vessel is underway, the vessel 
shall take action as necessary to avoid 
violating the relevant separation 
distance (e.g., attempt to remain parallel to the animal’s course, avoid excessive 
speed or abrupt changes in direction 
until the animal has left the area). If 
marine mammals are sighted within the 
relevant separation distance, the vessel 
must reduce speed and shift the engine 
to neutral, not engaging the engines 
until animals are clear of the area. This 
does not apply to any vessel towing gear 
or any vessel that is navigationally 
constrained. 
NMFS conducted an independent 
evaluation of the proposed measures, 
and has preliminarily determined that 
the proposed mitigation measures 
provide the means of effecting the least 
practicable impact on the affected 
species or stocks and their habitat, 
paying particular attention to rookeries, 
mating grounds, and areas of similar 
significance. 
Proposed Monitoring and Reporting 
In order to issue an IHA for an 
activity, section 101(a)(5)(D) of the 
MMPA states that NMFS must set forth 
requirements pertaining to the 
monitoring and reporting of such taking. 
The MMPA implementing regulations at 
50 CFR 216.104(a)(13) indicate that 
requests for authorizations must include 
the suggested means of accomplishing 
the necessary monitoring and reporting 
that will result in increased knowledge 
of the species and of the level of taking 
or impacts on populations of marine 
mammals that are expected to be 
present while conducting the activities. 
Effective reporting is critical both to 
compliance as well as ensuring that the

monitoring. 
Monitoring and reporting 
requirements prescribed by NMFS 
should contribute to improved 
understanding of one or more of the 
following: 
€Occurrence of marine mammal species or stocks in the area in which 
take is anticipated (e.g., presence, abundance, distribution, density); 
€Nature, scope, or context of likely marine mammal exposure to potential 
stressors/impacts (individual or 
cumulative, acute or chronic), through 
better understanding of: (1) action or 
environment (e.g., source characterization, propagation, ambient 
noise); (2) affected species (e.g., life history, dive patterns); (3) co-occurrence 
of marine mammal species with the 
activity; or (4) biological or behavioral 
context of exposure (e.g., age, calving or feeding areas); 
€Individual marine mammal responses (behavioral or physiological) 
to acoustic stressors (acute, chronic, or 
cumulative), other stressors, or 
cumulative impacts from multiple 
stressors; 
€How anticipated responses to stressors impact either: (1) long-term 
fitness and survival of individual 
marine mammals; or (2) populations, 
species, or stocks; 
€Effects on marine mammal habitat (e.g., marine mammal prey species, acoustic habitat, or other important 
physical components of marine 
mammal habitat); and 
€Mitigation and monitoring effectiveness. 
The proposed monitoring and 
reporting requirements described in the 
following were proposed by L–DEO in 
its adequate and complete application 
and/or are the result of subsequent 
coordination between NMFS and L– 
DEO. L–DEO has agreed to the 
requirements. NMFS describes these 
below as requirements and has included 
them in the proposed IHA. 
L–DEO must use dedicated, trained, 
and NMFS-approved PSOs. The PSOs 
must have no tasks other than to 
conduct observational effort, record 
observational data, and communicate 
with and instruct relevant vessel crew 
with regard to the presence of marine 
mammals and mitigation requirements. 
PSO resumes shall be provided to 
NMFS for advance approval (prior to 
embarking on the vessel). 
At least one of the visual and two of 
the acoustic PSOs (discussed below) 
aboard the vessel must have a minimum 
of 90 days at-sea experience working in 
those roles, respectively, with no more 
than 18 months elapsed since the 
conclusion of the at-sea experience. One 
visual PSO with such experience shall 
be designated as the lead for the entire 
protected species observation team. The 
lead PSO shall serve as primary point of 
contact for the vessel operator and 
ensure all PSO requirements per the 
IHA are met. To the maximum extent 
practicable, the experienced PSOs 
should be scheduled to be on duty with 
those PSOs with appropriate training 
but who have not yet gained relevant 
experience. 
Monitoring and reporting 
requirements prescribed by NMFS 
should contribute to improved 
understanding of one or more of the 
following: 
€Occurrence of marine mammal species or stocks in the area in which 
take is anticipated (e.g., presence, abundance, distribution, density); 
€Nature, scope, or context of likely marine mammal exposure to potential 
stressors/impacts (individual or 
cumulative, acute or chronic), through 
better understanding of: (1) action or 
environment (e.g., source characterization, propagation, ambient 
noise); (2) affected species (e.g., life history, dive patterns); (3) co-occurrence 
of marine mammal species with the

context of exposure (e.g., age, calving or feeding areas); 
€Individual marine mammal responses (behavioral or physiological) 
to acoustic stressors (acute, chronic, or 
cumulative), other stressors, or 
cumulative impacts from multiple 
stressors; 
€How anticipated responses to stressors impact either: (1) long-term 
fitness and survival of individual 
marine mammals; or (2) populations, 
species, or stocks; 
€Effects on marine mammal habitat (e.g., marine mammal prey species, acoustic habitat, or other important 
physical components of marine 
mammal habitat); and, 
€Mitigation and monitoring effectiveness. 
Vessel-Based Visual Monitoring 
As described above, PSO observations 
would take place during daytime airgun 
operations. During seismic survey 
operations, at least five visual PSOs 
would be based aboard the Langseth. 
Two visual PSOs would be on duty at 
all times during daytime hours. 
Monitoring shall be conducted in 
accordance with the following 
requirements: 
€The operator shall provide PSOs with bigeye reticle binoculars (e.g., 25 x 150; 2.7 view angle; individual ocular 
focus; height control) of appropriate 
quality solely for PSO use. These 
binoculars shall be pedestal-mounted on 
the deck at the most appropriate vantage 
point that provides for optimal sea 
surface observation, PSO safety, and 
safe operation of the vessel; and 
€The operator will work with the selected third-party observer provider to 
ensure PSOs have all equipment 
(including backup equipment) needed 
to adequately perform necessary tasks, 
including accurate determination of 
distance and bearing to observed marine 
mammals. 
PSOs must have the following 
requirements and qualifications: 
€PSOs shall be independent, dedicated, trained visual and acoustic 
PSOs and must be employed by a third- 
party observer provider; 
€PSOs shall have no tasks other than to conduct observational effort (visual or 
acoustic), collect data, and 
communicate with and instruct relevant 
vessel crew with regard to the presence 
of protected species and mitigation 
requirements (including brief alerts 
regarding maritime hazards); 
€PSOs shall have successfully completed an approved PSO training 
course appropriate for their designated 
task (visual or acoustic). Acoustic PSOs 
are required to complete specialized 
training for operating PAM systems and 
are encouraged to have familiarity with 
the vessel with which they will be 
working; 
€PSOs can act as acoustic or visual observers (but not at the same time) as 
long as they demonstrate that their 
training and experience are sufficient to 
perform the task at hand; 
€NMFS must review and approve PSO resumes accompanied by a relevant 
training course information packet that 
includes the name and qualifications 
(i.e., experience, training completed, or educational background) of the 
instructor(s), the course outline or 
syllabus, and course reference material 
as well as a document stating successful 
completion of the course; 
€PSOs must successfully complete relevant training, including completion 
of all required coursework and passing 
(80 percent or greater) a written and/or 
oral examination developed for the 
training program; 
€PSOs must have successfully attained a bachelor’s degree from an 
accredited college or university with a 
major in one of the natural sciences, a 
minimum of 30 semester hours or 
equivalent in the biological sciences, 
and at least one undergraduate course in 
math or statistics; and 
€The educational requirements may be waived if the PSO has acquired the 
relevant skills through alternate

shall be submitted to NMFS and must 
include written justification. Requests 
shall be granted or denied (with 
justification) by NMFS within 1 week of 
receipt of submitted information. 
Alternate experience that may be 
considered includes, but is not limited 
to (1) secondary education and/or 
experience comparable to PSO duties; 
(2) previous work experience 
conducting academic, commercial, or 
government-sponsored protected 
species surveys; or (3) previous work 
experience as a PSO; the PSO should 
demonstrate good standing and 
consistently good performance of PSO 
duties. 
€For data collection purposes, PSOs shall use standardized electronic data 
collection forms. PSOs shall record 
detailed information about any 
implementation of mitigation 
requirements, including the distance of 
animals to the airgun array and 
description of specific actions that 
ensued, the behavior of the animal(s), 
any observed changes in behavior before 
and after implementation of mitigation, 
and if shutdown was implemented, the

Reporting 
L–DEO shall submit a draft 
comprehensive report on all activities 
and monitoring results within 90 days 
of the completion of the survey or 
expiration of the IHA, whichever comes 
sooner. The report must describe all 
activities conducted and sightings of 
marine mammals, must provide full 
documentation of methods, results, and 
interpretation pertaining to all 
monitoring, and must summarize the 
dates and locations of survey operations 
and all marine mammal sightings (dates, 
times, locations, activities, associated 
survey activities). The draft report shall 
also include geo-referenced time- 
stamped vessel tracklines for all time

data collected as described above. A 
final report must be submitted within 30 
days following resolution of any 
comments on the draft report. 
The report must include a validation 
document concerning the use of PAM, 
which should include necessary noise 
validation diagrams and demonstrate 
whether background noise levels on the 
PAM deployment limited achievement 
of the planned detection goals. Copies of 
any vessel self-noise assessment reports 
must be included with the report. 
Reporting Injured or Dead Marine 
Mammals 
Discovery of injured or dead marine 
mammals—In the event that personnel 
involved in the survey activities 
discover an injured or dead marine 
mammal, the L–DEO shall report the 
incident to the Office of Protected 
Resources (OPR) as soon as feasible. The 
report must include the following 
information: 
€Time, date, and location (latitude/ longitude) of the first discovery (and 
updated location information if known 
and applicable); 
€Species identification (if known) or description of the animal(s) involved; 
€Condition of the animal(s) (including carcass condition if the 
animal is dead); 
€Observed behaviors of the animal(s), if alive; 
€If available, photographs or video footage of the animal(s); and 
€General circumstances under which the animal was discovered. 
Vessel strike—In the event of a strike 
of a marine mammal by any vessel 
involved in the activities covered by the 
authorization, L–DEO shall report the 
incident to OPR as soon as feasible. The 
report must include the following 
information: 
€Time, date, and location (latitude/ longitude) of the incident; 
€Vessel’s speed during and leading up to the incident; 
€Vessel’s course/heading and what operations were being conducted (if 
applicable); 
€Status of all sound sources in use; €Description of avoidance measures/ requirements that were in place at the 
time of the strike and what additional 
measure were taken, if any, to avoid 
strike; 
€Environmental conditions (e.g., wind speed and direction, BSS, cloud 
cover, visibility) immediately preceding 
the strike; 
€Species identification (if known) or description of the animal(s) involved; 
€Estimated size and length of the animal that was struck; 
€Description of the behavior of the marine mammal immediately preceding 
and following the strike; 
€If available, description of the presence and behavior of any other 
marine mammals present immediately 
preceding the strike; 
€Estimated fate of the animal (e.g., dead, injured but alive, injured and 
moving, blood or tissue observed in the 
water, status unknown, disappeared); 
and 
€To the extent practicable, photographs or video footage of the 
animal(s). 
Negligible Impact Analysis and 
Determination 
NMFS has defined negligible impact 
as an impact resulting from the 
specified activity that cannot be 
reasonably expected to, and is not 
reasonably likely to, adversely affect the 
species or stock through effects on 
annual rates of recruitment or survival 
(50 CFR 216.103). A negligible impact 
finding is based on the lack of likely 
adverse effects on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival (i.e., population- level effects). An estimate of the number 
of takes alone is not enough information 
on which to base an impact 
determination. In addition to 
considering estimates of the number of 
marine mammals that might be ‘‘taken’’ 
through harassment, NMFS considers 
other factors, such as the likely nature 
of any impacts or responses (e.g., 
intensity, duration), the context of any 
impacts or responses (e.g., critical reproductive time or location, foraging 
impacts affecting energetics), as well as 
effects on habitat, and the likely 
effectiveness of the mitigation. We also 
assess the number, intensity, and 
context of estimated takes by evaluating 
this information relative to population 
status. Consistent with the 1989 
preamble for NMFS’ implementing 
regulations (54 FR 40338, September 29, 
1989), the impacts from other past and 
ongoing anthropogenic activities are 
incorporated into this analysis via their 
impacts on the baseline (e.g., as reflected in the regulatory status of the 
species, population size and growth rate 
where known, ongoing sources of 
human-caused mortality, or ambient 
noise levels). 
To avoid repetition, the discussion of 
our analysis applies to all the species 
listed in table 1, given that the 
anticipated effects of this activity on 
these different marine mammal stocks 
are expected to be similar. NMFS does 
not anticipate that serious injury or 
mortality would occur as a result of L– 
DEO’s planned survey, even in the 
absence of mitigation, and no serious 
injury or mortality is proposed to be 
authorized. As discussed in the 
Potential Effects of Specified Activities 
on Marine Mammals and Their Habitat 
section above, non-auditory physical 
effects and vessel strike are not expected 
to occur. NMFS expects that all 
potential take would be in the form of 
Level B behavioral harassment in the 
form of temporary avoidance of the area 
or decreased foraging (if such activity 
was occurring), responses that are 
considered to be of low severity, and 
with no lasting biological consequences 
(e.g., Southall et al., 2007, 2021). These low-level impacts of behavioral 
harassment are not likely to impact the 
overall fitness of any individual or lead 
to population level effects of any 
species. As described above, Level A 
harassment is not expected to occur 
given the estimated small size of the 
Level A harassment zones and the 
unlikelihood that an individual would 
stay near the active source for 24 hours. 
In addition, the maximum expected 
Level B harassment zone around the 
survey vessel is 3,526 m. Therefore, the 
ensonified area surrounding the vessel 
is relatively small compared to the 
overall distribution of animals in the 
area and their use of the habitat. 
Feeding behavior is not likely to be 
significantly impacted as prey species 
are mobile and are broadly distributed 
throughout the survey area; therefore, 
marine mammals that may be 
temporarily displaced during survey 
activities are expected to be able to 
resume foraging once they have moved 
away from areas with disturbing levels 
of underwater noise. Because of the 
short duration (35 total survey days 
with 20 days of seismic operations) and 
temporary nature of the disturbance and 
the availability of similar habitat and 
resources in the surrounding area, the 
impacts to marine mammals and marine 
mammal prey species are not expected 
to cause significant or long-term fitness 
consequences for individual marine 
mammals or their populations.

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259359 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 241 / Thursday, December 18, 2025 / Notices Additionally, the acoustic ‘‘footprint’’ 
of the proposed survey would be very 
small relative to the ranges of all marine 
mammals that would potentially be 
affected. Sound levels would increase in 
the marine environment in a relatively 
small area surrounding the vessel 
compared to the range of the marine 
mammals within the proposed survey 
area. The seismic array would be active 
24 hours per day throughout the 
duration of the proposed survey. 
However, the very brief overall duration 
of the proposed survey (35 total survey 
days with 20 days of seismic operations) 
would further limit potential impacts 
that may occur as a result of the 
proposed activity. 
Of the marine mammal species that 
are likely to occur in the project area, 
the following species are listed as 
endangered or threatened under the 
ESA: humpback whales (Central 
America DPS), fin whales, sei whales, 
blue whale, and sperm whales. The take 
numbers proposed for authorization for 
these species (table 6) are minimal 
relative to their modeled population 
sizes; therefore, we do not expect 
population-level impacts to any of these 
species. Moreover, the actual range of 
the populations extends past the area 
covered by the model, so modeled 
population sizes are likely smaller than 
their actual population size. Lastly, as 
previously described, meaningful 
impacts from the seismic survey are 
even less likely to occur for high- 
frequency cetaceans (e.g., delphinids), as this group is relatively insensitive to 
sound produced at the predominant 
frequencies in an airgun pulse. The 
other marine mammal species that may 
be taken by harassment during L–DEO’s 
seismic survey are not listed as 
threatened or endangered under the 
ESA. There is no designated critical 
habitat for any ESA-listed marine 
mammals within the project area. 
There are no rookeries, mating, or 
calving grounds known to be 
biologically important to marine 
mammals within the survey area, and 
there are no feeding areas known to be 
biologically important to marine 
mammals within the survey area. 
In summary and as described above, 
the following factors primarily support 
our preliminary determination that the 
impacts resulting from this activity are 
not expected to adversely affect any of 
the species or stocks through effects on 
annual rates of recruitment or survival: 
€No Level A harassment, serious injury, or mortality is anticipated or 
authorized; 
€The proposed activity is temporary and of relatively short duration (35 days 
total with 20 days of airgun activity); 
€The anticipated impacts of the proposed activity on marine mammals 
would be temporary behavioral changes 
due to avoidance of the ensonified area, 
which is relatively small (see tables 4 
and 5); 
€The availability of alternative areas of similar habitat value for marine 
mammals to temporarily vacate the 
survey area during the proposed survey 
to avoid exposure to sounds from the 
activity is readily abundant; 
€The potential adverse effects on fish or invertebrate species that serve as prey 
species for marine mammals from the 
proposed survey would be temporary 
and spatially limited and impacts to 
marine mammal foraging would be 
minimal; and, 
€The proposed mitigation measures are expected to reduce the number and 
severity of takes, to the extent 
practicable, by visually and/or 
acoustically detecting marine mammals 
within the established zones and 
implementing corresponding mitigation 
measures (e.g., delay; shutdown). Based on the analysis contained 
herein of the likely effects of the 
specified activity on marine mammals 
and their habitat, and taking into 
consideration the implementation of the 
proposed monitoring and mitigation 
measures, NMFS preliminarily finds 
that the marine mammal take from the 
proposed activity will have a negligible 
impact on all affected marine mammal 
species or stocks. 
Small Numbers 
As noted previously, only take of 
small numbers of marine mammals may 
be authorized under section 101(a)(5)(A) 
and (D) of the MMPA for specified 
activities other than military readiness 
activities. The MMPA does not define 
small numbers and so, in practice, 
where estimated numbers are available, 
NMFS compares the number of 
individuals taken to the most 
appropriate estimation of abundance of 
the relevant species or population in our 
determination of whether an 
authorization is limited to small 
numbers of marine mammals. When the 
predicted number of individuals to be 
taken is fewer than one-third of the 
species or population abundance, the 
take is considered to be of small 
numbers (see 86 FR 5322, January 19, 2021). Additionally, other qualitative 
factors may be considered in the 
analysis, such as the temporal or spatial 
scale of the activities. 
The number of takes NMFS proposes 
to authorize is below one-third of the 
modeled abundance for all relevant 
populations (specifically, take of 
individuals is less than 2 percent of the 
modeled abundance of each affected 
population, see table 6). This is 
conservative because the modeled 
abundance represents a population of 
the species and we assume all takes are 
of different individual animals, which is 
likely not the case. Some individuals 
may be encountered multiple times in a 
day, but PSOs would count them as 
separate individuals if they cannot be 
identified. 
Based on the analysis contained 
herein of the proposed activity 
(including the proposed mitigation and 
monitoring measures) and the estimated 
take of marine mammals, NMFS 
preliminarily finds that small numbers 
of marine mammals would be taken 
relative to the size of the affected 
species or population. 
Unmitigable Adverse Impact Analysis 
and Determination 
There are no relevant subsistence uses 
of the affected marine mammal stocks or 
species implicated by this action. 
Therefore, NMFS has determined that 
the total taking of affected species or 
stocks would not have an unmitigable 
adverse impact on the availability of 
such species or stocks for taking for 
subsistence purposes. 
Endangered Species Act 
Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA of 1973 (16 
U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) requires that each 
Federal agency ensures that any action 
it authorizes, funds, or carries out is not 
likely to jeopardize the continued 
existence of any endangered or 
threatened species or result in the 
destruction or adverse modification of 
designated critical habitat. To ensure 
ESA compliance for the issuance of 
incidental take authorizations, NMFS 
consults internally whenever we 
propose to authorize take for ESA-listed 
species, in this case with the ESA 
Interagency Cooperation Division. 
NMFS is proposing to authorize take 
of humpback whales (Central America 
DPS), fin whales, sei whales, sperm 
whales and blue whales, which are 
listed under the ESA. The NMFS OPR 
Permits and Conservation Division has 
requested initiation of section 7 
consultation with the OPR ESA 
Interagency Cooperation Division for the 
issuance of this IHA. NMFS will 
conclude the ESA consultation prior to 
reaching a determination regarding the 
proposed issuance of the authorization. 
Proposed Authorization 
As a result of these preliminary 
determinations, NMFS proposes to issue 
an IHA to L–DEO for conducting a 
marine geophysical survey of the East 
Pacific Rise in the ETP, provided the

€A request for renewal is received no later than 60 days prior to the needed 
renewal IHA effective date (recognizing 
that the renewal IHA expiration date 
cannot extend beyond 1 year from 
expiration of the initial IHA). 
€The request for renewal must include the following: 
1. An explanation that the activities to 
be conducted under the requested 
renewal IHA are identical to the 
activities analyzed under the initial 
IHA, are a subset of the activities, or 
include changes so minor (e.g., 
reduction in pile size) that the changes 
do not affect the previous analyses, 
mitigation and monitoring 
requirements, or take estimates (with 
the exception of reducing the type or 
amount of take). 
2. A preliminary monitoring report 
showing the results of the required 
monitoring to date and an explanation 
showing that the monitoring results do 
not indicate impacts of a scale or nature 
not previously analyzed or authorized. 
€Upon review of the request for renewal, the status of the affected 
species or stocks, and any other 
pertinent information, NMFS 
determines that there are no more than 
minor changes in the activities, the 
mitigation and monitoring measures 
will remain the same and appropriate, 
and the findings in the initial IHA 
remain valid.

Title 3— 
The President 
Proclamation 10997 of December 15, 2025 
Bill of Rights Day, 2025 
By the President of the United States of America 
A Proclamation 
Two hundred and fifty years ago, our Nation was conceived in liberty, 
our freedom was wrested from the hands of tyranny, and our people coura-
geously united as one Nation under God, committed to the immortal prin-
ciples of sovereignty, justice, and self-determination. Today, we proudly 
celebrate the ratification of our Bill of Rights—the revolutionary document 
that enshrines in law the principles of freedom, human dignity, and due 
process upon which the United States was founded. On this Bill of Rights 
Day, we proudly carry forth the bold vision of our Founding Fathers. We 
recommit to the timeless freedoms enshrined in the Bill of Rights, and 
we vow to always preserve, protect, and defend our God-given rights, our 
glorious American heritage, and our constitutional way of life. 
Following the Revolutionary War, the framers of our Constitution set aside 
10 core protections from government authority that would ultimately become 
known as the ‘‘Bill of Rights.’’ After decades of oppression under British 
rule, James Madison—the Father of the Constitution—came to understand 
that it was necessary to clearly define what freedoms the law protected, 
setting the stage for the triumph of true self-government. Though Madison 
was once concerned that a written bill of rights would not succeed in 
fending off forces of tyranny and oppression, his friend Thomas Jefferson 
later convinced him: ‘‘A bill of rights is what the people are entitled to 
against every government on earth, general or particular, and what no just 
government should refuse or rest on inference.’’ 
In 1789, the First United States Congress drafted the first 10 amendments 
to the Constitution and later sent them to the States to ratify. In doing 
so, the States forever secured a series of freedoms that no tyrant could 
ever infringe—including the rights to speak and worship freely, to keep 
and bear arms, to resist unlawful arrest and seizure of private property, 
to be assured of a quick and fair trial, and to be protected against cruel 
and unusual punishment—and affirmed that the States hold all powers 
not granted to the Federal Government. 
More than two centuries later, these foundational legal principles remain 
the lifeblood of our Republic and continue to stand at the heart of our 
laws, our system of government, and our livelihood. Our framers understood 
that codifying our rights in ink alone would not be sufficient and that 
our rights depended on the endurance of bedrock American principles like 
the separation of powers, due process, checks and balances, and States’ 
rights. Above all, however, they knew that our rights would forever rely 
on a good and moral citizenry committed to the virtues that gave rise 
to our Republic and have sustained our liberty through victory and defeat, 
triumphs and setbacks, and times of peace and war since July 4, 1776. 
Every day, my Administration is acting with strength and conviction to 
guard these freedoms, the meaning of American citizenship, and our constitu-
tional heritage. We are restoring the rule of law, fighting back against left- 
wing lawfare, cleaning up our corrupt bureaucracies and draining the swamp, 
and forever ensuring that the American people do not answer to Washington, 
Washington answers to the American people.

Designating Fentanyl as a Weapon of Mass Destruction 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: 
Section 1. Purpose and Policy. Illicit fentanyl is closer to a chemical weapon than a narcotic. Two milligrams, an almost undetectable trace amount equiva-
lent to 10 to 15 grains of table salt, constitutes a lethal dose. Hundreds 
of thousands of Americans have died from fentanyl overdoses. 
The manufacture and distribution of fentanyl, primarily performed by orga-
nized criminal networks, threatens our national security and fuels lawlessness 
in our hemisphere and at our borders. The production and sale of fentanyl 
by Foreign Terrorist Organizations and cartels fund these entities’ oper-
ations—which include assassinations, terrorist acts, and insurgencies around 
the world—and allow these entities to erode our domestic security and 
the well-being of our Nation. The two cartels that are predominantly respon-
sible for the distribution of fentanyl in the United States engage in armed 
conflict over territory and to protect their operations, resulting in large- 
scale violence and death that go beyond the immediate threat of fentanyl 
itself. Further, the potential for fentanyl to be weaponized for concentrated, 
large-scale terror attacks by organized adversaries is a serious threat to 
the United States. 
As President of the United States, my highest duty is the defense of the 
country and its citizens. Accordingly, I hereby designate illicit fentanyl 
and its core precursor chemicals as Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). 
Sec. 2. Implementation. The heads of relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall take appropriate action to implement this order 
and eliminate the threat of illicit fentanyl and its core precursor chemicals 
to the United States. This includes the following actions: 
(a) the Attorney General shall immediately pursue investigations and pros-
ecutions into fentanyl trafficking, including through criminal charges as 
appropriate, sentencing enhancements, and sentencing variances; 
(b) the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury shall pursue 
appropriate actions against relevant assets and financial institutions in ac-
cordance with applicable law for those involved in or supporting the manu-
facture, distribution, and sale of illicit fentanyl and its core precursor chemi-
cals; 
(c) the Secretary of War and the Attorney General shall determine whether 
the threats posed by illicit fentanyl and its impact on the United States 
warrant the provision of resources from the Department of War to the Depart-
ment of Justice to aid in the enforcement of title 18 of the United States 
Code, as consistent with 10 U.S.C. 282; 
(d) the Secretary of War, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland 
Security, shall update all directives regarding the Armed Forces’ response 
to chemical incidents in the homeland to include the threat of illicit fentanyl; 
and 
(e) to ensure the United States uses the full array of appropriate counter- 
fentanyl tools, the Secretary of Homeland Security, as consistent with applica-
ble law and in coordination with the heads of relevant agencies, as appro-
priate, shall identify threat networks related to fentanyl smuggling using

spectrum of counter-fentanyl operations. 
Sec. 3. Definitions. (a) ‘‘Illicit fentanyl’’ means fentanyl that is manufactured, distributed, or dispensed, or possessed with intent to manufacture, distribute, 
or dispense in violation of section 401 and 406 of the Controlled Substances 
Act (21 U.S.C. 841, 846). 
(b) ‘‘Core precursor chemicals’’ means the core chemicals that create illicit 
fentanyl and its analogues, such as Piperidone or other Piperidone-based 
substances. 
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: 
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, 
or the head thereof; or 
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. 
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and 
subject to the availability of appropriations. 
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, 
substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party 
against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, 
employees, or agents, or any other person. 
(d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department 
of Justice.
