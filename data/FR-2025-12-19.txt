FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
12 CFR Part 201 
[Docket No. R–1882; RIN 7100–AH15] 
Regulation A: Extensions of Credit by 
Federal Reserve Banks 
AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 
ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (‘‘Board’’) has 
adopted final amendments to its 
Regulation A to reflect the Board’s 
approval of a decrease in the rate for 
primary credit at each Federal Reserve 
Bank. The secondary credit rate at each 
Reserve Bank automatically decreased 
by formula as a result of the Board’s 
primary credit rate action. 
DATES: 
Effective date: This rule is effective 
December 19, 2025. 
Applicability date: The rate changes 
for primary and secondary credit were 
applicable on December 11, 2025. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: M. Benjamin Snodgrass, Special Counsel 
(202–263–4877), Legal Division, or 
David Lowe, Financial Institution & 
Policy Analyst (202–893–6143), 
Division of Monetary Affairs; for users 
of telephone systems via text telephone 
(TTY) or any TTY-based 
Telecommunications Relay Services, 
please call 711 from any telephone, 
anywhere in the United States; Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System, 20th and C Streets NW, 
Washington, DC 20551. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal Reserve Banks make primary 
and secondary credit available to 
depository institutions as a backup 
source of funding on a short-term basis, 
usually overnight. The primary and 
secondary credit rates are the interest 
rates that the twelve Federal Reserve 
Banks charge for extensions of credit 
under these programs. In accordance 
with the Federal Reserve Act, the 
primary and secondary credit rates are 
established by the boards of directors of 
the Federal Reserve Banks, subject to 
review and determination of the Board. 
On December 10, 2025, the Board 
voted to approve a 0.25 percentage point 
decrease in the primary credit rate, 
thereby decreasing the primary credit 
rate from 4.00 percent to 3.75 percent. 
In addition, the Board had previously 
approved the renewal of the secondary 
credit rate formula, the primary credit 
rate plus 50 basis points. Under the 
formula, the secondary credit rate 
decreased by 0.25 percentage points as 
a result of the Board’s primary credit 
rate action, thereby decreasing the 
secondary credit rate from 4.50 percent 
to 4.25 percent. The amendments to 
Regulation A reflect these rate changes. 
The 0.25 percentage point decrease in 
the primary credit rate was associated 
with a 0.25 percentage point decrease in 
the target range for the federal funds rate 
(from a target range of 3
3
4percent to 4 
percent to a target range of 3
1
2percent 
to 3
3
4percent) announced by the 
Federal Open Market Committee on 
December 10, 2025, as described in the 
Board’s amendment of its Regulation D 
published elsewhere in today’s Federal 
Register. 
Administrative Procedure Act 
In general, the Administrative 
Procedure Act (‘‘APA’’)
1
imposes three 
principal requirements when an agency 
promulgates legislative rules (rules 
made pursuant to Congressionally 
delegated authority): (1) publication 
with adequate notice of a proposed rule; 
(2) followed by a meaningful 
opportunity for the public to comment 
on the rule’s content; and (3) 
publication of the final rule not less 
than 30 days before its effective date. 
The APA provides that notice and 
comment procedures do not apply if the 
agency for good cause finds them to be 
‘‘unnecessary, impracticable, or contrary 
to the public interest.’’
2
Section 553(d) 
of the APA also provides that 
publication at least 30 days prior to a 
rule’s effective date is not required for 
(1) a substantive rule which grants or 
recognizes an exemption or relieves a 
restriction; (2) interpretive rules and 
statements of policy; or (3) a rule for 
which the agency finds good cause for 
shortened notice and publishes its 
reasoning with the rule.
3
The APA 
further provides that the notice, public 
comment, and delayed effective date 
requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 do not 
apply ‘‘to the extent that there is 
involved . . . a matter relating to agency 
management or personnel or to public 
property, loans, grants, benefits, or 
contracts.’’
4
 
Regulation A establishes the interest 
rates that the twelve Reserve Banks 
charge for extensions of primary credit 
and secondary credit. The Board has 
determined that the notice, public 
comment, and delayed effective date 
requirements of the APA do not apply 
to these final amendments to Regulation 
A. The amendments involve a matter 
relating to loans and are therefore 
exempt under the terms of the APA. 
Furthermore, because delay would 
undermine the Board’s action in 
responding to economic data and 
conditions, the Board has determined 
that ‘‘good cause’’ exists within the 
meaning of the APA to dispense with 
the notice, public comment, and 
delayed effective date procedures of the 
APA with respect to the final 
amendments to Regulation A. 
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(‘‘RFA’’) does not apply to a rulemaking 
where a general notice of proposed 
rulemaking is not required.
5
As noted 
previously, a general notice of proposed 
rulemaking is not required if the final 
rule involves a matter relating to loans. 
Furthermore, the Board has determined 
that it is unnecessary and contrary to 
the public interest to publish a general 
notice of proposed rulemaking for this 
final rule. Accordingly, the RFA’s 
requirements relating to an initial and 
final regulatory flexibility analysis do 
not apply. 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
In accordance with the Paperwork 
Reduction Act (‘‘PRA’’) of 1995,
6
the 
Board reviewed the final rule under the 
authority delegated to the Board by the 
Office of Management and Budget. The

[Docket No. R–1883; RIN 7100–AH16] 
Regulation D: Reserve Requirements 
of Depository Institutions 
AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 
ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (‘‘Board’’) has 
adopted final amendments to its 
Regulation D to revise the rate of 
interest paid on balances (‘‘IORB’’) 
maintained at Federal Reserve Banks by 
or on behalf of eligible institutions. The 
final amendments specify that IORB is 
3.65 percent, a 0.25 percentage point 
decrease from its prior level. The 
amendment is intended to enhance the 
role of IORB in maintaining the federal 
funds rate in the target range established 
by the Federal Open Market Committee 
(‘‘FOMC’’ or ‘‘Committee’’). 
DATES: 
Effective date: This rule is effective 
December 19, 2025. 
Applicability date: The IORB rate 
change was applicable on December 11, 
2025.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Statutory and Regulatory Background 
For monetary policy purposes, section 
19 of the Federal Reserve Act (‘‘Act’’) 
imposes reserve requirements on certain 
types of deposits and other liabilities of 
depository institutions.
1
Regulation D, 
which implements section 19 of the Act, 
requires that a depository institution 
meet reserve requirements by holding 
cash in its vault, or if vault cash is 
insufficient, by maintaining a balance in 
an account at a Federal Reserve Bank 
(‘‘Reserve Bank’’).
2
Section 19 also 
provides that balances maintained by or 
on behalf of certain institutions in an 
account at a Reserve Bank may receive 
earnings to be paid by the Reserve Bank 
at least once each quarter, at a rate or 
rates not to exceed the general level of 
short-term interest rates.
3
Institutions 
that are eligible to receive earnings on 
their balances held at Reserve Banks 
(‘‘eligible institutions’’) include 
depository institutions and certain other 
institutions.
4
Section 19 also provides 
that the Board may prescribe regulations 
concerning the payment of earnings on 
balances at a Reserve Bank.
5
Prior to 
these amendments, Regulation D 
established IORB at 3.90 percent.
6
 
II. Amendment to IORB 
The Board is amending § 204.10(b)(1) 
of Regulation D to establish IORB at 3.65 
percent. The amendment represents a 
0.25 percentage point decrease in IORB. 
This decision was announced on 
December 10, 2025, with an effective 
date of December 11, 2025, in the 
Federal Reserve Implementation Note 
that accompanied the FOMC’s statement 
on December 10, 2025. The FOMC 
statement stated that the Committee 
decided to lower the target range for the 
federal funds rate to 3
1
2to 3
3
4percent. 
The Federal Reserve Implementation 
Note stated: 
The Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System voted unanimously to 
lower the interest rate paid on reserve 
balances to 3.65 percent, effective 
December 11, 2025. 
As a result, the Board is amending 
§ 204.10(b)(1) of Regulation D to 
establish IORB at 3.65 percent. 
III. Administrative Procedure Act 
In general, the Administrative 
Procedure Act (‘‘APA’’)
7
imposes three 
principal requirements when an agency 
promulgates legislative rules (rules 
made pursuant to Congressionally- 
delegated authority): (1) publication 
with adequate notice of a proposed rule; 
(2) followed by a meaningful 
opportunity for the public to comment 
on the rule’s content; and (3) 
publication of the final rule not less 
than 30 days before its effective date. 
The APA provides that notice and 
comment procedures do not apply if the 
agency for good cause finds them to be 
‘‘unnecessary, impracticable, or contrary 
to the public interest.’’
8
Section 553(d) 
of the APA also provides that 
publication at least 30 days prior to a 
rule’s effective date is not required for 
(1) a substantive rule which grants or 
recognizes an exemption or relieves a 
restriction; (2) interpretive rules and 
statements of policy; or (3) a rule for 
which the agency finds good cause for 
shortened notice and publishes its 
reasoning with the rule.
9
 
The Board has determined that good 
cause exists for finding that the notice, 
public comment, and delayed effective 
date provisions of the APA are 
unnecessary, impracticable, or contrary 
to the public interest with respect to 
these final amendments to Regulation D. 
The rate change for IORB that is 
reflected in the final amendment to 
Regulation D was made with a view 
towards accommodating commerce and 
business and with regard to their

bearing upon the general credit situation 
of the country. Notice and public 
comment would prevent the Board’s 
action from being effective as promptly 
as necessary in the public interest and 
would not otherwise serve any useful 
purpose. Notice, public comment, and a 
delayed effective date would create 
uncertainty about the finality and 
effectiveness of the Board’s action and 
undermine the effectiveness of that 
action. Accordingly, the Board has 
determined that good cause exists to 
dispense with the notice, public 
comment, and delayed effective date 
procedures of the APA with respect to 
this final amendment to Regulation D. 
IV. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(‘‘RFA’’) does not apply to a rulemaking 
where a general notice of proposed 
rulemaking is not required.
10
As noted 
previously, the Board has determined 
that it is unnecessary and contrary to 
the public interest to publish a general 
notice of proposed rulemaking for this 
final rule. Accordingly, the RFA’s 
requirements relating to an initial and 
final regulatory flexibility analysis do 
not apply. 
V. Paperwork Reduction Act 
In accordance with the Paperwork 
Reduction Act (‘‘PRA’’) of 1995,
11
the 
Board reviewed the final rule under the 
authority delegated to the Board by the 
Office of Management and Budget. The 
final rule contains no requirements 
subject to the PRA.

For the reasons set forth in the 
preamble, the Board amends 12 CFR

PART 204—RESERVE 
REQUIREMENTS OF DEPOSITORY 
INSTITUTIONS (REGULATION D) 
1. The authority citation for part 204 
continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 12 U.S.C. 248(a), 248(c), 461, 601, 611, and 3105.

(b) * * * 
(1) For balances maintained in an 
eligible institution’s master account,

balances maintained on that day. The 
IORB rate is 3.65 percent.

RIN 3064–AG24 
Special Assessment Collection 
AGENCY: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
ACTION: Interim final rule; request for comments. 
SUMMARY: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has been 
collecting a special assessment to 
recover losses arising from the 
protection of uninsured depositors 
under the systemic risk exception, as 
required by statute. To ensure that the 
FDIC recovers the correct amount of 
losses while minimizing the risk of 
overcollecting or undercollecting in 
aggregate, the FDIC is adopting this 
interim final rule to reduce the rate at 
which the special assessment will be 
collected in the eighth collection quarter 
from 3.36 basis points to 2.97 basis 
points, and provide an offset to regular 
quarterly deposit insurance assessments 
for banks subject to the special 
assessment if the amount collected 
exceeds losses following the resolution 
of litigation between the FDIC and SVB 
Financial Trust (SVBFT) and again 
following the termination of the 
receiverships. 
DATES: The interim final rule is effective December 19, 2025. Comments must be 
received on or before January 20, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: You may submit comments, identified by RIN 3064–AG24, by any of 
the following methods:

may review, redact, or refrain from 
posting all or any portion of any 
comment that it may deem to be 
inappropriate for publication, such as 
irrelevant or obscene material. The FDIC 
may post only a single representative 
example of identical or substantially 
identical comments, and in such cases 
will generally identify the number of 
identical or substantially identical 
comments represented by the posted 
example. All comments that have been 
redacted, as well as those that have not 
been posted, that contain comments on 
the merits of the proposed rule will be 
retained in the public comment file and 
will be considered as required under all 
applicable laws. All comments may be

Under the special assessment rule, the term 
‘‘banking organization’’ includes IDIs that are not 
subsidiaries of a holding company as well as 
holding companies with one or more subsidiary 
IDIs. Estimated uninsured deposits are reported in 
Memoranda Item 2 on Schedule RC–O, Other Data 
for Deposit Insurance Assessments of both the Call 
Report and FFIEC 002. Insured depository 
institutions IDIs with less than $1 billion in total 
assets as of June 30, 2021, were not required to 
report the estimated amount of uninsured deposits 
on the Call Report for December 31, 2022. 
Therefore, for IDIs that had less than $1 billion in 
total assets as of June 30, 2021, the amount and 
share of estimated uninsured deposits as of 
December 31, 2022, would be zero. For an IDI that 
is part of a holding company with more than one 
subsidiary IDI, the $5 billion deduction is 
apportioned based on its estimated uninsured 
deposits as a percentage of total estimated 
uninsured deposits held by all IDI affiliates in the 
banking organization. 
(in consultation with the President).

On March 12, 2023, the Secretary of the 
Treasury, acting on the recommendation 
of the Board and Board of Governors, 
and after consultation with the 
President, invoked the statutory 
systemic risk exception with respect to 
the resolutions of Silicon Valley Bank 
and Signature Bank.
2
 
Under section 13(c)(4)(G) of the FDI 
Act, the loss to the Deposit Insurance 
Fund (DIF) arising from the use of a 
systemic risk exception must be 
recovered from one or more special 
assessments on IDIs, depository 
institution holding companies (with the 
concurrence of the Secretary of the 
Treasury with respect to holding 
companies), or both, as the FDIC 
determines to be appropriate.
3
 
The estimated losses to the DIF 
attributable to Silicon Valley Bank and 
Signature Bank are periodically adjusted 
as the FDIC, as receiver of the failed 
banks, sells assets, satisfies liabilities, 
and incurs receivership expenses. The 
exact amount of actual losses incurred, 
and therefore the amount the FDIC must 
recover through the special assessment, 
will not be determined until the FDIC 
terminates the receiverships. 
II. The Final Rule Implementing the 
Special Assessment 
On November 29, 2023, the FDIC 
published in the Federal Register a final 
rule (the special assessment rule) to 
implement a special assessment, as 
required by the FDI Act, to recover the 
loss to the DIF arising from the 
protection of uninsured depositors 
following the closures of Silicon Valley 
Bank and Signature Bank.
4
 
As stated in that rulemaking, the 
special assessment rule allocated the 
collection over eight quarterly 
assessment periods to reduce the 
likelihood of overcollecting and to 
mitigate the liquidity effects of the 
special assessment on IDIs by requiring 
smaller, consistent quarterly payments. 
The FDIC began collecting the special 
assessment with the invoice for the first 
quarterly assessment period of 2024 
(i.e., January 1, 2024, through March 31, 2024), with a payment date of June 28, 
2024. Throughout the initial eight- 
quarter collection period, the special 
assessment has been collected at a 
quarterly rate of 3.36 basis points, 
multiplied by an IDI’s special 
assessment base of estimated uninsured 
deposits as reported in the Consolidated 
Reports of Condition and Income (Call 
Report) or Report of Assets and 
Liabilities of U.S. Branches and 
Agencies of Foreign Banks (FFIEC 002), 
reported for the quarter that ended 
December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude 
the first $5 billion in estimated 
uninsured deposits from the IDI, or for 
IDIs that are part of a holding company 
with one or more subsidiary IDIs, at the 
banking organization level.
5
 
The special assessment rule included 
provisions to extend the collection 
period or cease collection early in 
response to changes to the estimated 
losses to the DIF or if assessments 
collected change due to corrective 
amendments to the amount of 
uninsured deposits reported for the 
December 31, 2022, reporting period. 
Specifically, the special assessment rule 
included provisions to allow the FDIC 
to extend the collection period over one 
or more quarters as needed to collect the 
difference between the amount collected 
after the initial eight collections and the 
estimated or actual losses at the end of 
the eight-quarter collection period. 
Conversely, if, prior to the end of the 
initial eight-quarter collection period, 
the estimated or actual losses are less 
than the amount collected, the special 
assessment rule included a provision to 
allow the FDIC to cease collection of the 
special assessment before the end of the 
initial eight-quarter collection period. 
However, pursuant to the special 
assessment rule, the FDIC is required to 
collect at a quarterly rate of 3.36 basis 
points until the FDIC has collected 
enough to recover actual or estimated 
losses, which means that it may collect 
more than the amount of estimated 
losses. Additionally, even if the FDIC 
ceased collection early, a future 
decrease in losses would result in the 
FDIC overcollecting. 
As with all receiverships, the loss 
estimates attributable to Silicon Valley 
Bank and Signature Bank are 
periodically adjusted as the FDIC, as 
receiver of the failed banks, sells assets, 
satisfies liabilities, and incurs 
receivership expenses. The exact 
amount of actual losses incurred will be 
determined when the FDIC terminates 
the receiverships. In the event that the 
final loss amounts at the termination of 
the receiverships exceed the amount 
collected, the special assessment rule 
provides for a one-time final shortfall 
special assessment. 
III. The Interim Final Rule 
The objectives of the interim final rule 
are to ensure that the FDIC recovers the 
correct amount of losses, while 
minimizing the risk of overcollecting or 
undercollecting. Through this rule, 
during the eighth collection quarter, the 
FDIC will recover approximately the full 
amount of estimated losses as of 
September 30, 2025, while minimizing 
any amounts collected in excess of the 
estimated losses, by reducing the rate at 
which the special assessment will be 
collected from 3.36 basis points to 2.97 
basis points. The interim final rule also 
requires the FDIC to provide an offset to 
regular quarterly deposit insurance 
assessments for IDIs subject to the 
special assessment if the aggregate 
amount collected exceeds estimated 
losses following the resolution of 
litigation between the FDIC and SVBFT, 
and again following the termination of 
the receiverships. As provided for in the 
special assessment rule, if losses at the 
termination of the receiverships exceed 
the amount collected, the FDIC will 
implement a one-time final shortfall 
special assessment to ensure the full 
amount of actual losses is recovered as 
required by law. 
A. Reduction in Rate for Eighth Special 
Assessment Collection 
As of September 30, 2025, the total 
loss estimate for Silicon Valley Bank 
and Signature Bank attributable to the 
protection of uninsured depositors 
pursuant to the systemic risk 
determination, which must be recovered 
through the special assessment, was 
$16.7 billion. As of September 30, 2025, 
the FDIC completed six quarterly 
collections of the special assessment, at 
an average of $2.1 billion per quarter, 
resulting in collection of $12.7 billion. 
The FDIC anticipates collecting another 
$2.1 billion for the seventh quarter of 
the initial collection period, with an 
invoice payment date of December 30, 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  15:45 Dec 18, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\19DER1.SGM 19DER1
lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES159371 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Rules and Regulations 6
In the event that an IDI’s regular quarterly 
deposit insurance assessment amount is less than 
the offset amount allocated to the IDI, the FDIC 
would apply the offset to the IDI’s assessment 
amount for one or more additional quarters as 
needed, until the offset amount is exhausted. 
7
In the event that the FDIC provides an offset to 
regular quarterly deposit insurance assessments 
prior to the termination of the receiverships, and 
loss estimates later increase relative to amounts 
collected, the FDIC will collect the remaining 
amount needed to fully recover losses through the 
one-time final shortfall special assessment.

reports/ffiec-reports-condition-and-income- 
instructions-ffiec-031-and-041-report-2. 
2025, for a total projected collection of 
$14.8 billion. 
Absent the interim final rule, the 
FDIC would invoice and collect the 
eighth quarterly special assessment 
period, with an invoice payment date of 
March 30, 2026, at the quarterly rate of 
3.36 basis points for a projected amount 
of $2.1 billion. This would bring the 
projected cumulative amount collected 
for all eight collection quarters to $16.9 
billion. Thus, if the FDIC collected the 
eighth quarter at the quarterly rate of 
3.36 basis points, as required by the 
special assessment rule, the FDIC would 
collect approximately $250 million 
more than estimated losses as of 
September 30, 2025. 
To ensure that the FDIC collects the 
correct amount (i.e., an amount approximately equal to the loss estimate 
as of September 30, 2025, and to avoid 
overcollection), the FDIC, through this 
interim final rule, will collect the 
special assessment in the eighth 
collection quarter, with an invoice 
payment date of March 30, 2026, at a 
reduced rate of 2.97 basis points. This 
is the rate required to collect an amount 
approximately equal to the difference 
between estimated losses of $16.7 
billion as of September 30, 2025, and 
the anticipated collection amount of 
$14.8 billion through the seventh 
quarterly collection period. Because the 
cumulative amount collected through 
the initial special assessment period is 
projected to equal the loss estimate as of 
September 30, 2025, the extended 
assessment period will not be necessary, 
and therefore, as a conforming change, 
the interim final rule removes the 
extended assessment period provisions 
of the special assessment rule. 
B. Potential Offset to Regular Quarterly 
Deposit Insurance Assessments 
To ensure that the FDIC collects the 
correct amount, without overcollecting 
or undercollecting, the FDIC will 
provide offsets to regular quarterly 
deposit insurance assessments for IDIs 
subject to the special assessment, as 
described below. Any offsets provided 
would be an amount proportional to the 
amount that each bank paid towards the 
special assessment.
6
 
The largest known variable that could 
result in banks overpaying is the 
outcome of pending litigation between 
the FDIC and SVBFT. SVBFT has 
asserted a $1.71 billion deposit claim, 
and the special assessment calculation 
assumes the estimated $1.71 billion 
claim will result in a $1.71 billion loss 
to the DIF. However, the FDIC, as 
receiver, has asserted defenses to this 
deposit claim, and any amounts 
awarded based on its defenses would 
offset all or part of the $1.71 billion loss 
and reduce the total amount of losses 
the FDIC needs to recover through the 
special assessment. Thus, the outcome 
of the litigation could result in a 
significant overpayment of the special 
assessment. 
As a result, the FDIC has decided to 
provide an offset to IDIs subject to the 
special assessment at the subsequent 
quarterly assessment if, following the 
final resolution of the SVBFT litigation, 
the total amount collected through the 
special assessment exceeds the loss 
estimates at that time. More specifically, 
the offset would occur beginning the 
quarter after the resolution of the final, 
unappealable, judgment or settlement of 
the litigation between the FDIC and 
SVBFT. Under the interim final rule, the 
FDIC will provide an offset at that time 
if the collection amount exceeds loss 
estimates, including any changes to loss 
estimates resulting from estimated asset 
recoveries or other asset disposition 
efforts, and regardless of the outcome of 
the SVBFT litigation. However, if the 
collection amount is equal to or less 
than loss estimates, the FDIC will take 
no action until the termination of the 
receiverships, consistent with the 
special assessment rule. The FDIC will, 
potentially, provide an offset at that 
time due to the magnitude of the SVBFT 
litigation, which is significantly larger 
than other known variables impacting 
the loss estimates. 
C. Final Offset to Regular Quarterly 
Deposit Insurance Assessments or One- 
Time Final Shortfall Special Assessment 
In addition, under the interim final 
rule, upon termination of the 
receiverships, the FDIC will either (1) 
provide an offset to regular quarterly 
deposit insurance assessments for IDIs 
subject to the special assessment if the 
amount collected exceeds losses, or (2) 
collect from IDIs subject to the special 
assessment a one-time final shortfall 
special assessment, as provided in the 
special assessment rule. In the latter 
scenario, the FDIC will implement a 
one-time final shortfall special 
assessment with advanced notice of 45 
days.
7
In aggregate, this will ensure that 
the FDIC ultimately collects the correct 
amount, equal to losses attributable to 
the systemic risk exception. 
D. Mergers, Consolidations, and 
Terminations of Deposit Insurance 
Offsets applied following a merger or 
consolidation will be provided to a 
surviving or resulting IDI. Under the 
interim final rule, any offset that would 
have been applied to any bank with an 
insured status that is terminated after 
the effective date of this interim final 
rule or prior to the application of any 
offset, and for which the deposit 
liabilities were not assumed by another 
IDI, will not occur. 
IV. Accounting Treatment 
Each bank should account for the 
special assessment in accordance with 
U.S. generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP). In accordance with 
Financial Accounting Standards Board 
Accounting Standards Codification 
Topic 450, Contingencies (FASB ASC Topic 450), an estimated loss from a loss 
contingency shall be accrued by a 
charge to income if information 
indicates that it is probable that a 
liability has been incurred and the 
amount of loss is reasonably estimable.
8
 
Therefore, a bank will recognize in the 
Call Report and other financial 
statements the accrual of a liability and 
estimated loss (i.e., expense) from a loss contingency for the special assessment 
when the bank determines that the 
conditions for accrual under GAAP have 
been met. In addition, the General 
Instructions to the Call Report provide 
guidance on ASC Topic 855, 
Subsequent Events, which may be 
applicable.
9
 
If a bank had previously accrued its 
best estimate of the liability for the 
special assessment and the related 
expense, a bank should adjust its 
previous accrual based on subsequent 
notifications from the FDIC relating to 
changes in the total special assessment 
in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 
450–20. 
Similarly, each bank should account 
for any shortfall special assessment in 
accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450 
when the conditions for accrual under 
GAAP have been met. 
V. Expected Effects 
To estimate the economic effects of 
the interim final rule, this analysis 
considers all relevant regulations 
applicable to FDIC-insured institutions,

The decline in the number of banking 
organizations subject to the special assessment 
between enactment and September 30, 2025, is due 
to bank mergers.

The difference between the $250 million 
estimated overcollection and the $246 million 
reduction in the eighth quarterly collection is the 
result of rounding when calculating the collection 
amount, using a special assessment rate in basis

considering estimated losses.

as well as information on the financial 
condition of FDIC-insured institutions 
as of the quarter ending September 30, 
2025, as the baseline to which the 
effects of the proposed rule are 
estimated. As of the quarter ending 
September 30, 2025, the FDIC-insured 
4,388 depository institutions.
10
The 
special assessment rule applies to 
banking organizations that reported 
estimated uninsured deposits in excess 
of $5 billion as of the quarter ending 
December 31, 2022. The special 
assessment rule identified 114 banking 
organizations subject to the special 
assessment, and 110 banking 
organizations remain subject to the 
special assessment as of the quarter 
ending September 30, 2025.
11
 
The interim final rule will benefit IDIs 
subject to the special assessment by 
reducing the estimated overcollection in 
the eighth collection quarter by $246 
million. These funds are a transfer in 
the context of cost-benefit analysis.
12
To 
ensure the FDIC recovers approximately 
the full amount of estimated losses as of 
September 30, 2025, while minimizing 
amounts collected in excess of the 
estimated losses, the interim final rule 
will reduce the rate at which the special 
assessment will be collected in the 
eighth collection quarter from 3.36 basis 
points to 2.97 basis points. Under the 
baseline, affected IDIs will pay $2.1 
billion scheduled to be assessed in the 
eighth quarterly collection. Under the 
interim final rule, affected IDIs will only 
pay $1.9 billion in the eight quarterly 
collection. The quarterly collection 
amount is projected to be $246 million 
lower, which results in quarterly 
savings of 11.6 percent for banking 
organizations subject to the special 
assessment.
13
 
The interim final rule could also 
benefit IDIs subject to the special 
assessment by providing an offset to 
regular quarterly deposit insurance 
assessments. If the special assessment 
amount collected exceeds estimated 
losses following the resolution of 
pending litigation between the FDIC and 
SVBFT, the FDIC will apply an offset to 
regular deposit insurance assessments. 
Any such offset will be applied to 
quarterly assessments beginning the 
quarter after the resolution of the 
litigation. If the amount collected 
exceeds losses upon termination of the 
receiverships, the FDIC will also apply 
an offset to regular deposit insurance 
assessments. 
Any such assessment offset would 
increase retained income for affected 
IDIs. Affected IDIs could employ 
increased retained income by passing it 
on to equity holders, retaining it, or 
lending those funds to customers. As 
mentioned previously, estimated losses 
remain uncertain and the amount of 
actual losses incurred will be 
determined when the FDIC terminates 
the receiverships. Therefore, based on 
estimated losses as of September 30, 
2025, the projected collection amount 
through the eighth quarterly collection, 
and continued uncertainty in estimated 
losses, the FDIC is not estimating an 
amount for any assessment offset. 
Therefore, the FDIC estimates the 
interim final rule will convey benefits to 
IDIs subject to the special assessment 
through prospective returns on the $246 
million in funds they will retain from 
the reduced eighth quarterly collection 
amount. The FDIC does not have the 
information necessary to estimate how 
IDIs will utilize those funds. If the funds 
are invested at the effective federal 
funds rate of 3.88 percent, the affected 
IDIs will earn annual benefits of $9.53 
million.
14
If the IDIs instead invest the 
funds in banking assets with a yield of 
5.56 percent (the annualized yield on 
earning assets for the banking industry 
through September 30, 2025), the 
annual benefits will be $13.66 million.
15
 
Therefore, the FDIC estimates the 
economic effect of this interim final rule 
to be $9.53 million or $13.66 million 
annually. 
VI. Request for Comment 
The FDIC invites comments on all 
aspects of the interim final rule. In 
particular, the FDIC requests comment 
on the following: 
Question 1: Are there alternative 
methodologies or timing for applying 
offsets or collecting the remaining 
amount of the estimated losses 
attributable to the protection of 
uninsured depositors pursuant to the 
systemic risk determination the FDIC 
should consider and why? 
Question 2: Are there policy or 
accounting considerations regarding the 
special assessment collection or the 
application of an offset to regular 
quarterly deposit insurance assessments 
that are relevant, but not discussed in 
the interim final rule? 
Question 3: The FDIC invites 
comments on expected effects. In 
particular, are there effects of the 
interim final rule that the FDIC did not 
consider? 
VII. Administrative Law Matters 
A. Administrative Procedure Act 
The FDIC is issuing the interim final 
rule without prior notice and the 
opportunity for public comment and the 
delayed effective date ordinarily 
prescribed by the Administrative 
Procedure Act (APA).
16
Pursuant to 
section 553(b)(B) of the APA, general 
notice and the opportunity for public 
comment are not required with respect 
to a rulemaking when an ‘‘agency for 
good cause finds (and incorporates the 
finding and a brief statement of reasons 
therefore in the rules issued) that notice 
and public procedure thereon are 
impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary 
to the public interest.’’
17
Pursuant to 
section 553(d)(1) of the APA, a rule may 
become effective without waiting for the 
delayed effective date to elapse where 
the rule ‘‘grants an exemption or 
relieves a restriction.’’
18
 
The eighth quarterly special 
assessment collection will occur in the 
first quarter of 2026, and there is 
material benefit to the FDIC in not 
delaying the collection (which would 
likely be necessary if going through a 
full notice-and-comment rulemaking 
process) and to IDIs subject to the 
special assessment, who benefit from 
having certainty regarding the amount 
to be collected in the first quarter of 
2026. As a result, the FDIC finds that the 
public interest is best served by the 
interim final rule being effective 
immediately upon publication in the 
Federal Register and without prior 
notice and opportunity for public 
comment. 
Nevertheless, the FDIC desires to have 
the benefit of public comment and 
invites interested parties to submit 
comments during a 30-day comment 
period, particularly on aspects of the 
rule that are less time-sensitive than the 
eighth collection amount. The 30-day 
comment period will allow the FDIC to

The SBA defines a small banking organization 
as having $850 million or less in assets, where an 
organization’s ’’assets are determined by averaging 
the assets reported on its four quarterly financial 
statements for the preceding year.’’ See 13 CFR 121.201 (as amended by 87 FR 69118, effective 
December 19, 2022). In its determination, the ’’SBA 
counts the receipts, employees, or other measure of 
size of the concern whose size is at issue and all 
of its domestic and foreign affiliates.’’ See 13 CFR 121.103. Following these regulations, the FDIC uses 
an insured depository institution’s affiliated and 
acquired assets, averaged over the preceding four 
quarters, to determine whether the insured 
depository institution is ’’small’’ for the purposes of 
RFA.

receive comments in a timely manner, 
given that the interim rule will be 
effective on December 19, 2025. In 
adopting any final regulation, the FDIC 
will revise the interim final rule if 
appropriate in light of the comments 
received. 
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
requires an agency to consider whether 
the rules it proposes will have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities.
19
 
The RFA applies only to rules for which 
an agency publishes a general notice of 
proposed rulemaking pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 553(b). As discussed previously, 
consistent with section 553(b)(B) of the 
APA, the FDIC has determined for good 
cause that general notice and 
opportunity for public comment is 
unnecessary, and therefore the FDIC is 
not issuing a notice of proposed 
rulemaking. Accordingly, the FDIC has 
concluded that the RFA’s requirements 
relating to initial and final regulatory 
flexibility analysis do not apply. 
Nevertheless, the FDIC is voluntarily 
presenting information in this RFA 
section and seeking comment on 
whether, and the extent to which, the 
interim final rule would affect a 
significant number of small entities. The 
Small Business Administration (SBA) 
has defined ‘‘small entities’’ to include 
banking organizations with total assets 
of less than or equal to $850 million.
20
 
The FDIC insures 4,430 institutions as 
of June 30, 2025, of which 3,092 are 
small entities.
21
The special assessment 
is paid by IDIs that are part of banking 
organizations that reported more than 
$5 billion in uninsured deposits for the 
reporting period that ended December 
31, 2022. Given that no small entity has 
reported more than $5 billion in 
uninsured deposits, the FDIC does not 
believe the interim final rule will have 
a direct effect on any small entity. 
C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(PRA)
22
states that no agency may 
conduct or sponsor, nor is the 
respondent required to respond to, an 
information collection unless it displays 
a currently valid Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) control number. The 
FDIC’s OMB control numbers for its 
assessment regulations are 3064–0057, 
3064–0151, and 3064–0179. The interim 
final rule does not create any new, or 
revise any of these existing assessment 
information collections pursuant to the 
PRA; consequently, no submissions in 
connection with these OMB control 
numbers will be made to the OMB for 
review. 
D. Riegle Community Development and 
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 
The Riegle Community Development 
and Regulatory Improvement Act of 
1994 generally provides that new 
regulations or amendments to 
regulations prescribed by a Federal 
banking agency that impose additional 
reporting, disclosure, or other new 
requirements on IDIs shall take effect on 
the first day of a calendar quarter that 
begins on or after the date on which the 
regulations are published in final form, 
unless the agency determines, for good 
cause published with the rule, that the 
rule should become effective for such 
time.
23
For the reasons discussed above, 
the FDIC has determined that good 
cause exists for the interim final rule to 
become effective immediately upon 
publication in the Federal Register. 
E. Plain Language 
Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach- 
Bliley Act
24
requires the Federal 
banking agencies to use plain language 
in all proposed and final rulemakings 
published in the Federal Register after 
January 1, 2000. The FDIC has sought to 
present the interim final rule in a simple 
and straightforward manner. The FDIC 
invites comments on whether the 
interim final rule is clearly stated and 
effectively organized and how the FDIC 
might make the proposal easier to 
understand. 
F. Congressional Review Act 
For purposes of the Congressional 
Review Act, the OMB makes a 
determination as to whether a final rule 
constitutes a ‘‘major’’ rule.
25
If a rule is 
deemed a ‘‘major rule’’ by the OMB, the 
Congressional Review Act generally 
provides that the rule may not take 
effect until at least 60 days following its 
publication.
26
 
The Congressional Review Act defines 
a ‘‘major rule’’ as any rule that the 
Administrator of the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs of 
the OMB finds has resulted in or is 
likely to result in (1) an annual effect on 
the economy of $100,000,000 or more; 
(2) a major increase in costs or prices for 
consumers, individual industries, 
Federal, State, or local government 
agencies or geographic regions; or (3) 
significant adverse effects on 
competition, employment, investment, 
productivity, innovation, or on the 
ability of United States-based 
enterprises to compete with foreign- 
based enterprises in domestic and 
export markets.
27
 
The OMB has determined that the 
interim final rule is not a major rule for 
purposes of the Congressional Review 
Act. The FDIC will submit the rule and 
other appropriate reports to Congress 
and the Government Accountability 
Office for review. 
List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 327 
Bank deposit insurance, Banks, 
Banking, Savings associations. 
Authority and Issuance 
For the reasons stated in the 
preamble, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation amends 12 CFR part 327 as 
follows: 
PART 327—ASSESSMENTS 
1. The authority citation for part 327 
continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 12 U.S.C. 1813, 1815, 1817–19, 1821, 1823. 
2. Revise and republish § 327.13 to 
read as follows: 
§ 327.13 Special assessment pursuant to 
March 12, 2023, systemic risk 
determination. 
(a) Special assessment. A special assessment shall be imposed on each 
insured depository institution to recover 
losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund, as 
described in paragraph (b) of this 
section, resulting from the March 12, 
2023, systemic risk determination 
pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1823(c)(4)(G). The 
special assessment shall be collected 
from each insured depository institution 
on a quarterly basis as described in this 
section during the initial special 
assessment period as defined in 
paragraph (i) of this section and, if 
necessary, on a one-time basis as 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  15:45 Dec 18, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\19DER1.SGM 19DER1
lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES159374 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Rules and Regulations described in paragraph (l) of this 
section. 
(b) Losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund. As used in this section, ‘‘losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund’’ refers to 
losses incurred by the Deposit Insurance 
Fund resulting from actions taken by the 
FDIC under the March 12, 2023, 
systemic risk determination, as may be 
revised from time to time. 
(c) Calculation of quarterly special assessment amount. An insured 
depository institution’s special 
assessment for each quarter during the 
initial special assessment period shall 
be calculated by multiplying the special 
assessment rate defined in paragraph 
(i)(2) of this section by the institution’s 
special assessment base as defined in 
paragraph (i)(3) of this section. 
(d) Invoicing of special assessment. For each assessment period in which 
the special assessment is imposed, the 
FDIC shall advise each insured 
depository institution of the amount and 
calculation of any special assessment 
payment due in a form that notifies the 
institution of the special assessment 
base and special assessment rate 
exclusive of any other assessments 
imposed under this part. The FDIC shall 
also advise each insured depository 
institution subject to the special 
assessment of any revisions, if any, to 
losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund as 
defined in paragraph (b) of this section. 
This information shall be provided at 
the same time as the institution’s 
quarterly certified statement invoice 
under § 327.2 for the assessment period 
in which the special assessment was 
imposed. 
(e) Payment of quarterly special assessment amount. Each insured 
depository institution shall pay to the 
Corporation any special assessment 
imposed under this section in 
compliance with and subject to the 
provisions of §§ 327.3, 327.6, and 327.7. 
The date for any special assessment 
payment shall be the date provided in 
§ 327.3(b)(2) for the institution’s 
quarterly certified statement invoice for 
the calendar quarter in which the 
special assessment was imposed. 
(f) Uninsured deposits. For purposes of this section, the term ‘‘uninsured 
deposits’’ means an institution’s 
estimated uninsured deposits as 
reported in Memoranda Item 2 on 
Schedule RC–O, Other Data For Deposit 
Insurance Assessments in the 
Consolidated Reports of Condition and 
Income (Call Report) or Report of Assets 
and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and 
Agencies of Foreign Banks (FFIEC 002) 
for the quarter ended December 31, 
2022, reported as of the later of: 
(1) November 2, 2023, adjusted for 
mergers prior to March 12, 2023; or 
(2) The date of the institution’s most 
recent amendment to its Call Report or 
FFIEC 002 for the quarter ended 
December 31, 2022, if such amendment 
arises from, or is confirmed through, the 
FDIC’s Assessment Reporting Review. 
Institutions with less than $1 billion in 
total assets as of June 30, 2021, were not 
required to report such items; therefore, 
for purposes of calculating the special 
assessment or a shortfall special 
assessment under this section, the 
amount of uninsured deposits for such 
institutions as of December 31, 2022, is 
zero. 
(g) Five billion dollar deduction from the special assessment base— 
institution’s portion. For purposes of 
this section, an institution’s portion of 
the $5 billion deduction shall equal the 
ratio of the institution’s uninsured 
deposits to the sum of the institution’s 
uninsured deposits and the uninsured 
deposits of all of the institution’s 
affiliated insured depository 
institutions, multiplied by $5 billion. 
(h) Affiliates. For the purposes of this section, an affiliated insured depository 
institution is an insured depository 
institution that meets the definition of 
‘‘affiliate’’ in section 3 of the FDI Act, 
12 U.S.C. 1813(w)(6). 
(i) Special assessment during initial special assessment period—(1) Initial special assessment period. The initial 
special assessment period shall begin 
with the first quarterly assessment 
period of 2024 and end the last 
quarterly assessment period of 2025. 
(2) Special assessment rate during initial special assessment period. The 
special assessment rate during the first 
seven quarters of the initial special 
assessment period is 3.36 basis points 
on a quarterly basis, and the rate during 
the last quarterly assessment period of 
2025 is 2.97 basis points. 
(3) Special assessment base during initial special assessment period. (i) The 
special assessment base for an insured 
depository institution during the initial 
special assessment period that has no 
affiliated insured depository institution 
shall equal: 
(A) The institution’s uninsured 
deposits; minus 
(B) Five billion dollars; provided, 
however, that an institution’s 
assessment base cannot be negative. 
(ii) The special assessment base for an 
insured depository institution during 
the initial special assessment period 
that has one or more affiliated insured 
depository institutions shall equal: 
(A) The institution’s uninsured 
deposits; minus 
(B) The institution’s portion of the $5 
billion deduction; provided, however, 
that an institution’s special assessment 
base cannot be negative. 
(j) Effect of mergers, consolidations, and other terminations of insurance on 
the special assessment—(1) Final quarterly certified invoice for acquired 
institution. The surviving or resulting insured depository institution in a 
merger or consolidation shall be liable 
for any unpaid special assessment or 
one-time final shortfall special 
assessment outstanding at the time of 
the merger or consolidation on the part 
of the institution that is not the resulting 
or surviving institution consistent with 
§ 327.6. 
(2) Special assessment for quarter in which the merger or consolidation 
occurs and subsequent quarters. If an 
insured depository institution is the 
surviving or resulting institution in a 
merger or consolidation or acquires all 
or substantially all of the assets, or 
assumes all or substantially all of the 
deposit liabilities, of an insured 
depository institution, then the 
surviving or resulting insured 
depository institution or the insured 
depository institution that acquires such 
assets or assumes such deposit 
liabilities, shall be liable for the 
acquired institutions’ special 
assessment from the quarter of the 
acquisition through the remainder of the 
initial special assessment period, 
including any one-time final shortfall 
special assessment. 
(3) Other termination. When the insured status of an institution is 
terminated, and the deposit liabilities of 
such institution are not assumed by 
another insured depository institution, 
the special assessment and any shortfall 
special assessment shall be paid 
consistent with § 327.6(c). When an 
insured depository institution 
voluntarily terminates its deposit 
insurance, the institution shall be liable 
for any unpaid special assessment or 
one-time final shortfall special 
assessment outstanding at the time of 
the termination and all future special 
assessments, if any, the institution 
would have been invoiced through the 
remainder of the initial special 
assessment period, as applicable, 
including any one-time final shortfall 
special assessment for which the 
institution has been given notice before 
termination. Any special assessment or 
one-time final shortfall special 
assessment liabilities will be included, 
in full, on the final quarterly assessment 
invoice following voluntary 
termination. 
(k) Corrective reporting amendments—(1) Recalculation of VerDate Sep<11>2014  15:45 Dec 18, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\19DER1.SGM 19DER1
lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES159375 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Rules and Regulations quarterly special assessment amount. 
Corrective amendments to an 
institution’s uninsured deposits that 
arise from, or are confirmed through, the 
FDIC’s Assessment Reporting Review 
will apply retroactively beginning the 
first quarterly collection period of the 
initial special assessment period. An 
institution’s special assessment base 
and portion of the $5 billion deduction, 
along with the portion of the $5 billion 
deduction allocated to the institution’s 
affiliated insured depository 
institutions, will be recalculated for 
prior collection quarters. Any 
overpayment or underpayment in prior 
collection quarters as a result of the 
recalculation will be invoiced as 
described in paragraph (k)(2) of this 
section. 
(2) Invoicing overpayment and underpayment. Any underpayment of the special assessment by an institution 
as the result of corrective amendments 
to uninsured deposits will be included, 
in full and with interest, on the invoice 
for the quarter following the date a 
corrective amendment is filed. If a 
corrective amendment results in an 
overpayment of the special assessment, 
the institution will be credited the 
overpayment amount, with interest, and 
such amount will be applied to the 
institution’s subsequent special 
assessment invoices beginning in the 
quarter following the date of the 
amendment. If any excess credit amount 
remains after the end of the initial 
special assessment period, the excess 
credit amount shall be refunded to the 
institution. Payment and collection of 
interest on amounts resulting from 
overpayment and underpayment of the 
special assessment shall be consistent 
with § 327.7. 
(l) One-time final shortfall special assessment. If the aggregate amount of the special assessment collected does 
not meet or exceed the losses to the 
Deposit Insurance Fund, as calculated 
after the receiverships resulting from the 
March 12, 2023, systemic risk 
determination are terminated, insured 
depository institutions shall pay a one- 
time final shortfall special assessment in 
accordance with this paragraph (l). 
(1) Notification of one-time final shortfall special assessment. The FDIC 
shall notify each insured depository 
institution of the amount of such 
institution’s one-time final shortfall 
special assessment no later than 45 days 
before such shortfall assessment is due. 
(2) Aggregate one-time final shortfall special assessment amount. The 
aggregate amount of the one-time final 
shortfall special assessment imposed 
across all insured depository 
institutions shall equal the losses to the 
Deposit Insurance Fund, as of 
termination of the receiverships to 
which the March 12, 2023, systemic risk 
determination applied, minus the 
aggregate amount of the special 
assessment collected under this section 
less any amount applied as an offset, as 
described in paragraph (p)(1)(i) of this 
section, including the net amount of 
interest paid or received as a result of 
overpayments and underpayments. 
(3) One-time final shortfall special assessment rate. The final shortfall 
special assessment rate shall be the 
aggregate final shortfall special 
assessment amount divided by the total 
amount of uninsured deposits, as 
described in paragraph (f) of this 
section, adjusted for mergers, 
consolidation, and termination of 
insurance as of the assessment period 
preceding the final shortfall special 
assessment period, minus the $5 billion 
deduction for each insured depository 
institution or each institution’s portion 
of the $5 billion deduction. 
(4) One-time final shortfall special assessment base. (i) The one-time final 
shortfall special assessment base for an 
insured depository institution that has 
no affiliated insured depository 
institution shall equal: 
(A) The institution’s uninsured 
deposits; minus 
(B) $5 billion; provided, however, that 
an institution’s one-time final shortfall 
special assessment base cannot be 
negative. 
(ii) The one-time final shortfall 
special assessment base for an insured 
depository institution that has one or 
more affiliated insured depository 
institutions shall equal: 
(A) The institution’s uninsured 
deposits; minus 
(B) The institution’s portion of the $5 
billion deduction, adjusted for 
termination of insurance as of the 
assessment period preceding the final 
shortfall assessment period; provided, 
however, that an institution’s one-time 
final shortfall special assessment base 
cannot be negative. 
(5) Calculation of one-time final shortfall special assessment. An insured 
depository institution’s final shortfall 
special assessment shall be calculated 
by multiplying the final shortfall special 
assessment rate by the institution’s one- 
time final shortfall special assessment 
base. 
(6) One-time final special assessment. The one-time final shortfall special 
assessment shall be collected on a one- 
time quarterly basis after losses to the 
Deposit Insurance Fund are determined 
after termination of the receiverships to 
which the March 12, 2023, systemic risk 
determination applied. 
(7) Payment, invoicing, and mergers. Paragraphs (d), (e), and (j) of this section 
are applicable to the one-time shortfall 
special assessment. 
(m) Request for revisions. An insured depository institution may submit a 
written request for revision of the 
computation of any special assessment 
or shortfall special assessment pursuant 
to this part consistent with § 327.3(f). 
(n) Special assessment collection in excess of losses. Any special assessment 
collected under this section that exceeds 
the losses to the Deposit Insurance 
Fund, as of termination of the 
receiverships to which the March 12, 
2023, systemic risk determination 
applied, shall be placed in the Deposit 
Insurance Fund. 
(o) Rule of construction. Nothing in this section shall prevent the FDIC from 
imposing additional special assessments 
as required to recover current or future 
losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund 
resulting from any systemic risk 
determination under 12 U.S.C. 
1823(c)(4)(G). 
(p) Assessment offsets. The FDIC will provide offsets, in accordance with this 
paragraph (p), to the quarterly risk- 
based assessments calculated under 
§ 327.3(b)(1), of institutions that have 
paid the special assessment. 
(1) Timing. Assessment offsets will be provided if the aggregate amount of the 
special assessment collected exceeds the 
losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund as 
of: 
(i) The final unappealable judgment 
or settlement of the litigation between 
the FDIC and SVB Financial Trust (Case 
No. 5:24–cv–01321–BLF, U.S. District 
Court for the Northern District of 
California); and 
(ii) The termination of the 
receiverships to which the March 12, 
2023, systemic risk determination 
applied. 
(2) Application of offsets. Assessment offsets will be included on the quarterly 
certified statement invoice(s) for the 
assessment period following the timing 
provisions in paragraphs (p)(1)(i) and 
(ii) of this section, if applicable. 
(3) Calculation. To determine an institution’s offset amount, the FDIC 
will calculate the percentage that an 
insured depository institution 
contributed towards the total amount of 
the special assessment collected and 
then multiply that percentage by the 
amount of special assessment collected 
in excess of losses to the Deposit 
Insurance Fund at the time of the 
calculation. 
(4) Mergers, consolidations, and other terminations of insurance. An offset 
under this paragraph (p) shall be 
provided to the surviving or resulting

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), U.S. Department 
of Transportation (DOT). 
ACTION: Correcting amendments. SUMMARY: On September 3, 2025, FAA published a final rule titled 
‘‘Falsification, Reproduction, Alteration, 
Omission, or Incorrect Statements’’. 
That final rule incorrectly deleted three 
sections of Title 14 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations rather than the 
intended one paragraph in each of those 
sections. This document corrects the 
final regulations. 
DATES: Effective December 19, 2025. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 3, 2025, the ‘‘Falsification, 
Reproduction, Alteration, Omission, or 
Incorrect Statements’’ final rule (RIN 
2120–AL84) was published in the 
Federal Register at 90 FR 42517. That 
final rule amended, restructured, and 
consolidated the falsification 
regulations presently located throughout 
Title 14 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations. In addition, that rule also 
created a falsification prohibition 
applicable to the regulations governing 
commercial space transportation. After 
publication, FAA discovered that three 
sections, 120.103, 142.11, and 413.17, 
were inadvertently removed. This was 
not FAA’s intent. Rather, FAA sought to 
remove and reserve paragraphs 
120.103(e), 142.11(e)(3), and 413.17(c). 
This document places §§ 120.103, 
142.11, and 413.17 back in Title 14 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations. These 
sections read the same as they did prior 
to the publication of the final rule, with 
the exception of removing and reserving 
paragraphs 120.103(e), 142.11(e)(3), and 
413.17(c).

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. 
ACTION: Final amendment; final order. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the Agency, or 
we) is classifying the electrical tongue 
nerve stimulator to treat motor deficits 
into class II (special controls). The 
special controls that apply to the device 
type are identified in this order and will 
be part of the codified language for the 
classification of the electrical tongue 
nerve stimulator to treat motor deficits. 
We are taking this action because we 
have determined that classifying the 
device into class II will provide a 
reasonable assurance of safety and 
effectiveness of the device. We believe 
this action will also enhance patients’ 
access to beneficial innovative devices, 
in part by reducing regulatory burdens.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
Upon request, FDA has classified the 
electrical tongue nerve stimulator to 
treat motor deficits as class II (special 
controls), which we have determined 
will provide a reasonable assurance of 
safety and effectiveness. In addition, we 
believe this action will enhance 
patients’ access to beneficial innovation, 
in part by reducing regulatory burdens 
by placing the device into a lower 
device class than the automatic class III 
assignment. 
The automatic assignment of class III 
occurs by operation of law and without 
any action by FDA, regardless of the 
level of risk posed by the new device. 
Any device that was not in commercial 
distribution before May 28, 1976, is 
automatically classified as, and remains 
within, class III and requires premarket 
approval unless and until FDA takes an 
action to classify or reclassify the device 
(see 21 U.S.C. 360c(f)(1)). We refer to 
these devices as ‘‘postamendments 
devices’’ because they were not in 
commercial distribution prior to the 
date of enactment of the Medical Device 
Amendments of 1976, which amended 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (FD&C Act). 
FDA may take a variety of actions in 
appropriate circumstances to classify or 
reclassify a device into class I or II. We 
may issue an order finding a new device 
to be substantially equivalent under 
section 513(i) of the FD&C Act (see 21 
U.S.C. 360c(i)) to a predicate device that 
does not require premarket approval. 
We determine whether a new device is 
substantially equivalent to a predicate 
device by means of the procedures for 
premarket notification under section 
510(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
360(k)) and part 807 (21 CFR part 807). 
FDA may also classify a device 
through ‘‘De Novo’’ classification, a 
common name for the process 
authorized under section 513(f)(2) of the 
FD&C Act (see also part 860, subpart D 
(21 CFR part 860, subpart D)). Section 
207 of the Food and Drug 
Administration Modernization Act of 
1997 (Pub. L. 105–115) established the 
first procedure for De Novo 
classification. Section 607 of the Food 
and Drug Administration Safety and 
Innovation Act (Pub. L. 112–144) 
modified the De Novo application 
process by adding a second procedure. 
A device sponsor may utilize either 
procedure for De Novo classification. 
Under the first procedure, the person 
submits a 510(k) for a device that has 
not previously been classified. After 
receiving an order from FDA classifying 
the device into class III under section 
513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, the person 
then requests a classification under 
section 513(f)(2). 
Under the second procedure, rather 
than first submitting a 510(k) and then 
a request for classification, if the person 
determines that there is no legally 
marketed device upon which to base a 
determination of substantial 
equivalence, that person requests a 
classification under section 513(f)(2) of 
the FD&C Act. 
Under either procedure for De Novo 
classification, FDA is required to 
classify the device by written order 
within 120 days. The classification will 
be according to the criteria under 
section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act. 
Although the device was automatically 
placed within class III, the De Novo 
classification is considered to be the 
initial classification of the device. 
We believe this De Novo classification 
will enhance patients’ access to 
beneficial innovation, in part by 
reducing regulatory burdens. When FDA 
classifies a device into class I or II via 
the De Novo process, the device can 
serve as a predicate for future devices of 
that type, including for 510(k)s (see 
section 513(f)(2)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act). 
As a result, other device sponsors do not 
have to submit a De Novo request or 
premarket approval application to 
market a substantially equivalent device 
(see section 513(i) of the FD&C Act, 
defining ‘‘substantial equivalence’’). 
Instead, sponsors can use the less 
burdensome 510(k) process, when 
necessary, to market their device. 
II. De Novo Classification 
On August 4, 2020, FDA received 
Helius Medical Inc.’s request for De 
Novo classification of the Portable 
Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNS). 
FDA reviewed the request in order to 
classify the device under the criteria for 
classification set forth in section 
513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act. 
We classify devices into class II if 
general controls by themselves are 
insufficient to provide reasonable 
assurance of safety and effectiveness, 
but there is sufficient information to 
establish special controls that, in 
combination with the general controls, 
provide reasonable assurance of the 
safety and effectiveness of the device for 
its intended use (see section 513(a)(1)(B) 
of the FD&C Act). After review of the 
information submitted in the request, 
we determined that the device can be 
classified into class II with the 
establishment of special controls. FDA 
has determined that these special 
controls, in addition to the general 
controls, will provide reasonable 
assurance of the safety and effectiveness 
of the device. 
Therefore, on March 25, 2021, FDA 
issued an order to the requester 
classifying the device into class II. In 
this final order, FDA is codifying the 
classification of the device by adding 21 
CFR 882.5889.
1
We have named the 
generic type of device ‘‘electrical tongue 
nerve stimulator to treat motor deficits,’’ 
and it is identified as a prescription 
device that consists of a non- 
implantable apparatus to generate 
electrical pulses for stimulation of the 
nerves in the tongue to provide 
treatment of motor deficits. 
FDA has identified the following risks 
to health associated specifically with 
this type of device and the measures 
required to mitigate these risks in table 
1.

FDA has determined that special 
controls, in combination with the 
general controls, address these risks to 
health and provide reasonable assurance 
of safety and effectiveness. For a device 
to fall within this classification, and 
thus avoid automatic classification in 
class III, it would have to comply with 
the special controls named in this final 
order. The necessary special controls 
appear in the regulation codified by this 
final order. 
Under the FD&C Act, submission of a 
premarket notification under section 
510(k) (21 U.S.C. 360(k)) is required to 
reasonably assure the safety and 
effectiveness of class II devices unless 
FDA determines that the device type 
should be exempt under section 510(m). 
At this time FDA has not made this 
determination for electrical tongue 
nerve stimulators to treat motor deficits. 
This device is therefore subject to 
premarket notification requirements 
under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act. 
At the time of classification, the 
electrical tongue nerve stimulator to 
treat motor deficits is for prescription 
use only. Prescription devices are 
exempt from the requirement for 
adequate directions for use for the 
layperson under section 502(f)(1) of the 
FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)) and 21 
CFR 801.5, as long as the conditions of 
21 CFR 801.109 are met. 
III. Analysis of Environmental Impact 
The Agency has determined under 21 
CFR 25.34(b) that this action is of a type 
that does not individually or 
cumulatively have a significant effect on 
the human environment. Therefore, 
neither an environmental assessment 
nor an environmental impact statement 
is required. 
IV. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
This final order establishes special 
controls that refer to previously 
approved collections of information 
found in other FDA regulations and 
guidance. These collections of 
information are subject to review by the 
Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501–3521). The 
collections of information in part 860, 
subpart D, regarding De Novo 
classification have been approved under 
OMB control number 0910–0844; the 
collections of information in 21 CFR 
part 814, subparts A through E, 
regarding premarket approval have been 
approved under OMB control number 
0910–0231; the collections of 
information in part 807, subpart E, 
regarding premarket notification 
submissions have been approved under 
OMB control number 0910–0120; the 
collections of information in 21 CFR 
part 820 regarding quality system 
regulation have been approved under 
OMB control number 0910–0073; and 
the collections of information in 21 CFR 
parts 801 regarding labeling have been 
approved under OMB control number 
0910–0485.

§ Section 
U.S.C. United States Code 
II. Background and Authority 
The Coast Guard received notification 
that fireworks will be launched from a 
vessel on the Ohio River near 
Wellsburg, WV. Hazards from fireworks 
displays include accidental discharge of 
fireworks, dangerous projectiles, and 
falling hot embers or other debris. The 
Captain of the Port (COTP) Pittsburgh 
has determined that potential hazards 
associated with fireworks are a safety 
concern for anyone on the Ohio River 
within a one mile area of the fireworks 
display. Therefore, the COTP is issuing 
this rule under the authority in 46 
U.S.C. 70034, which is needed to 
protect personnel, vessels, and the 
marine environment in the navigable 
waters within the safety zone. 
The Coast Guard is issuing this rule 
without prior notice and comment. As 
is authorized by 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the 
Coast Guard finds that good cause exists 
for not publishing a notice of proposed 
rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this 
rule because it is impracticable and 
contrary to the public interest. The 
Coast Guard was not provided notice of 
this event with sufficient time to 
publish an NPRM and consider public 
comments before the safety zone must 
be established on December 31, 2025. 
For the same reasons, the Coast Guard 
finds that under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), good 
cause exists for making this rule 
effective less than 30 days after 
publication in the Federal Register. 
III. Discussion of the Rule 
This rule establishes a safety zone 
from 11 p.m. on December 31, 2025 
until 1 a.m. on January 1, 2026. The 
safety zone will cover all navigable 
waters within the one-mile area between 
Mile Markers 73 and 74 on the Ohio 
River, near Wellsburg, WV. No vessel or 
person will be permitted to enter the 
safety zone without obtaining 
permission from the COTP or their 
designated representative. 
IV. Regulatory Analyses 
We developed this rule after 
considering numerous statutes and 
Executive orders related to rulemaking. 
Below we summarize our analyses 
based on a number of these statutes and 
Executive orders. 
A. Impact on Small Entities 
The regulatory flexibility analysis 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601–612, do not 
apply to rules that are not subject to 
notice and comment. Because the Coast 
Guard has, for good cause, waived the

would otherwise apply to this 
rulemaking, the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act’s flexibility analysis provisions do 
not apply here. 
Under section 213(a) of the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104–121), 
if this rule will affect your small 
business, organization, or governmental 
jurisdiction and you have questions, 
contact the person listed in the 
FOR 
FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACTsection. 
Small businesses may send comments 
to the Small Business and Agriculture 
Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman 
and the Regional Small Business 
Regulatory Fairness Boards by calling 1– 
888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734–3247). The 
Coast Guard will not retaliate against 
small entities that question or complain 
about this rule or any policy or action 
of the Coast Guard. 
B. Collection of Information 
This rule will not call for a new 
collection of information under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3501–3520). 
C. Federalism and Indian Tribal 
Governments 
We have analyzed this rule under 
Executive Order 13132, Federalism, and 
have determined that it is consistent 
with the fundamental federalism 
principles and preemption requirements 
described in that Order. 
Also, this rule does not have tribal 
implications under Executive Order 
13175, Consultation and Coordination 
with Indian Tribal Governments, 
because it does not have a substantial 
direct effect on one or more Indian 
tribes, on the relationship between the 
Federal Government and Indian tribes, 
or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities between the Federal 
Government and Indian tribes. 
D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
As required by The Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 
1531–1538), the Coast Guard certifies 
that this rule will not result in an 
annual expenditure of $100,000,000 or 
more (adjusted for inflation) by a State, 
local, or tribal government, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector. 
E. Environment 
We have analyzed this rule under 
Department of Homeland Security 
Directive 023–01, Rev. 1, associated 
implementing instructions, and 
Environmental Planning COMDTINST 
5090.1 (series), which guide the Coast 
Guard in complying with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 
U.S.C. 4321–4370f), and have 
determined that this action is one of a 
category of actions that do not 
individually or cumulatively have a 
significant effect on the human 
environment. 
This rule involves a temporary safety 
zone. It is categorically excluded from 
further review under paragraph L60(a) 
of Appendix A, Table 1 of DHS 
Instruction Manual 023–01–001–01, 
Rev. 1. A Record of Environmental 
Consideration supporting this 
determination is available in the docket.

AGENCY: Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security. 
ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for 
navigable waters of the La Quinta Ship 
Channel. The safety zone is needed to 
protect personnel, vessels, and the 
marine environment from potential 
hazards created by the removal of 
submerged dredge pipeline. Entry of 
vessels or persons into this zone is 
prohibited unless specifically 
authorized by the Captain of the Port, 
Sector Corpus Christi. 
DATES: This rule is effective without actual notice from December 19, 2025 
through December 24, 2025. For the 
purposes of enforcement, actual notice 
will be used from December 18, 2025, 
until December 19, 2025. The Coast 
Guard anticipates that this rule will be 
enforced only one day during this 
period. The day and time of 
enforcement will depend on the weather 
conditions and will be announced to the 
public in advance.

NPRM Notice of proposed rulemaking 
§ Section 
U.S.C. United States Code 
II. Background and Authority 
The Coast Guard received notification 
that Callan Marine will be removing 
submerged pipeline within the La 
Quinta Channel near Ingleside, TX. 
Hazards from this project include but 
are not limited to deployment of heavy 
equipment which will obstruct vessel 
traffic, continuous diving operation, and 
various other activities which create 
underwater hazards for workers and the 
public. The Captain of the Port (COTP) 
Corpus Christi has determined that 
potential hazards associated with 
installation of submerged pipeline are a 
safety concern for anyone within the 
work area. Therefore, the COTP is 
issuing this rule under the authority in 
46 U.S.C. 70034, which is needed to 
protect personnel, vessels, and the 
marine environment in the navigable 
waters within the safety zone. 
The Coast Guard is issuing this rule 
without prior notice and comment. As 
is authorized by 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the 
Coast Guard finds that good cause exists 
for not publishing a notice of proposed 
rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this 
rule because it is impracticable and 
contrary to the public interest. The 
Coast Guard was notified of this event 
on December 12, 2025, but we must 
establish this safety zone by December 
18, 2025, to protect personnel, vessels, 
and the marine environment. Therefore, 
we do not have enough time to solicit 
and respond to comments. 
For the same reasons, the Coast Guard 
finds that under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), good 
cause exists for making this rule 
effective less than 30 days after 
publication in the Federal Register. 
III. Discussion of the Rule 
This rule establishes a safety zone 
from December 18, 2025, to December 
24, 2025. The day and time of 
enforcement will depend on the weather 
conditions and will be announced to the 
public in advance. The safety zone will 
cover all navigable waters in the La 
Quinta Ship Channel within the 
following points: Point 1 at 27°4926.74 
N, 97°1338.82 W; thence to Point 2 at 27°4929.86 N, 97°1329.48 W; thence to Point 3 at 27°4913.55 N, 97°1310.17 W thence to Point 4 at 27°499.49 N, 97°1327.31 W; thence returning to Point 1. 
IV. Regulatory Analyses 
We developed this rule after 
considering numerous statutes and 
Executive orders related to rulemaking. 
Below we summarize our analyses 
based on a number of these statutes and 
Executive orders. 
A. Impact on Small Entities 
The regulatory flexibility analysis 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601–612, do not 
apply to rules that are not subject to 
notice and comment. Because the Coast 
Guard has, for good cause, waived the 
notice and comment requirement that 
would otherwise apply to this 
rulemaking, the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act’s flexibility analysis provisions do 
not apply here. 
Under section 213(a) of the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104–121), 
if this rule will affect your small 
business, organization, or governmental 
jurisdiction and you have questions, 
contact the person listed in the 
FOR 
FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACTsection. 
Small businesses may send comments 
to the Small Business and Agriculture 
Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman 
and the Regional Small Business 
Regulatory Fairness Boards by calling 1– 
888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734–3247). The 
Coast Guard will not retaliate against 
small entities that question or complain 
about this rule or any policy or action 
of the Coast Guard. 
B. Collection of Information 
This rule will not call for a new 
collection of information under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3501–3520). 
C. Federalism and Indian Tribal 
Governments 
We have analyzed this rule under 
Executive Order 13132, Federalism, and 
have determined that it is consistent 
with the fundamental federalism 
principles and preemption requirements 
described in that Order. 
Also, this rule does not have tribal 
implications under Executive Order 
13175, Consultation and Coordination 
with Indian Tribal Governments, 
because it does not have a substantial 
direct effect on one or more Indian 
tribes, on the relationship between the 
Federal Government and Indian tribes, 
or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities between the Federal 
Government and Indian tribes. 
D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
As required by The Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 
1531–1538), the Coast Guard certifies 
that this rule will not result in an 
annual expenditure of $100,000,000 or 
more (adjusted for inflation) by a State, 
local, or tribal government, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector. 
E. Environment 
We have analyzed this rule under 
Department of Homeland Security 
Directive 023–01, Rev. 1, associated 
implementing instructions, and 
Environmental Planning COMDTINST 
5090.1 (series), which guide the Coast 
Guard in complying with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 
U.S.C. 4321–4370f), and have 
determined that this action is one of a 
category of actions that do not 
individually or cumulatively have a 
significant effect on the human 
environment. 
This rule is a safety zone. It is 
categorically excluded from further 
review under paragraph L60(a) of 
Appendix A, Table 1 of DHS Instruction 
Manual 023–01–001–01, Rev. 1. A 
Record of Environmental Consideration

[Docket No. 2024–2] 
Group Registration of Two- 
Dimensional Artwork 
AGENCY: U.S. Copyright Office, Library of Congress. 
ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Copyright Office is creating a new group registration option 
for two-dimensional artwork. This 
option will allow applicants to register 
up to twenty works published within 
one calendar year by submitting a single 
online application with a digital deposit 
copy of each work. The Office will 
examine each work to determine if it 
contains a sufficient amount of creative 
pictorial or graphic authorship. If the 
Office registers the claim, the 
registration will cover each artwork in 
the group as a separate work of 
authorship. 
DATES: Effective February 17, 2026. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Rhea Efthimiadis, Assistant to the 
General Counsel, by email at meft@
copyright.gov, or by telephone at 202– 707–8350. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background
1
 
The Copyright Act authorizes the 
Register of Copyrights to specify by 
regulation the administrative classes of 
works available for the purpose of 
registration and the deposit required for 
each class.
2
The Act also gives the 
Register the discretion to allow 
registration of groups of related works 
with one application and filing fee.
3
 
Pursuant to her authority to establish 
group registration options, the Register 
has issued regulations permitting group 
registrations for several types of works, 
including news websites, newspapers, 
newsletters and serials, unpublished 
and published photographs, 
contributions to periodicals, secure test 
items, works on an album of music, 
short online literary works, and 
database updates.
4
 
The Office initiated this rulemaking 
after receiving requests from 
stakeholders to establish a new group 
registration option for two-dimensional 
artwork.
5
Stakeholder groups 
representing artists identified several 
common features of two-dimensional 
artwork, including its distinct 
vulnerability to downstream 
infringement
6
and the significant 
number of works some artists produce 
each year.
7
Stakeholders also stated 
that, despite infringement concerns, 
most artists do not engage with the 
Office’s registration system due to the 
cost of registering individual works 
relative to their potential revenue, the 
lack of time and resources necessary to 
register multiple individual works, and 
unfamiliarity or difficulty with the 
registration process.
8
 
On February 15, 2024, the Office 
published a Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (‘‘NPRM’’) to establish a 
new group registration option for two- 
dimensional artwork, recognizing the 
challenges facing artists and a 
‘‘legitimate need’’ for a new group 
registration option.
9
The NPRM 
proposed allowing an applicant to 
register a group of up to ten works 
published within a thirty-day time 
period by submitting a single online 
application with a digital deposit copy 
of each work. Each work included 
would have to be a single two- 
dimensional pictorial or graphic work, 
such as a painting, sketch, or character 
artwork; three-dimensional works, 
works consisting of multiple images, 
and architectural works or technical 
drawings would not be eligible for this 
group registration option. The proposed 
rule stated that the Office would 
examine each work to determine if it 
contains a sufficient amount of creative 
pictorial or graphic authorship for 
copyright protection. If registered, each 
artwork would be considered a separate 
work of authorship. The rule also 
included a requirement that each work 
in the group be created by the same 
author, who is also the copyright 
claimant for each work. Finally, 
applicants would be required to identify 
the title and publication date for each 
work, and to submit their claims

Compare NPRM at 11791 (quoting Coalition, Comments in Response to 2019 Fee Study NPRM, 
through the online copyright 
registration system, using an application 
specific to this group registration 
option. 
The Office received fourteen 
comments in response to the NPRM. 
Almost all commenters supported the 
Office’s proposal to create the new 
group registration option.
10
Some 
requested modifications to the rule, and 
three expressly conditioned their 
support on substantive changes, which 
would substantially change the rule’s 
scope.
11
In general, commenters 
proposed expanding eligibility: 
increasing the number of works that can 
be included, lengthening the time 
period during which all works within 
the application must be published (and 
clarifying the publication dates), and 
permitting the inclusion of additional 
types of works. Some commenters 
proposed including three-dimensional 
works; others proposed permitting 
works by joint authors, and revising the 
works made for hire and author/ 
claimant requirements. Several 
commenters also proposed alternative 
procedures for amending or annotating 
the submitted registration record; 
adjusting the filing fee; and using an 
alternative application form. Finally, 
one commenter suggested the Office 
permit applicants to ‘‘choose the name 
for their group of works being 
registered.’’
12
The Office has reviewed 
and carefully considered each of the 
comments. 
The final rule adopts the proposed 
rule with two clarifications and two 
modifications expanding the number of 
works that can be included and the time 
period within which they have been 
published, as described below. With 
respect to requests that the scope of the 
rule be expanded further, the Office will 
closely monitor the use of the new 
group option and determine whether 
future consideration is warranted. 
II. The Final Rule 
A. Eligibility Requirements 
1. Types of Works That May Be 
Included 
In the NPRM, the Office proposed 
limiting this group registration option to 
‘‘a pictorial or graphic work that has 
been fixed in a two-dimensional form,’’ 
such as character artwork or logos. It 
proposed that each pictorial or graphic 
work within the group consist of ‘‘no 
more than a single pictorial or graphic 
work, such as one drawing, one 
illustration, one comic strip, or one 
fabric design, and the work must be 
deposited in one uploaded file.’’ Several 
commenters urged the Office to expand 
the rule to include other types of works, 
including three-dimensional works, 
architectural works or technical 
drawings, and applied art.
13
The 
Coalition of Visual Artists (‘‘Coalition’’) 
stated that these works ‘‘involve the 
same review for copyrightability as the 
USCO proposes in the Rule.’’
14
Two 
commenters also specifically asserted 
that any distinction between two- and 
three-dimensional works is ‘‘arbitrary’’ 
because ‘‘in most instances the deposit 
copies provided in both [ ] are going to 
be the same.’’
15
Professors Elizabeth 
Townsend Gard and Blaze D’Amico 
further stated that the proposed rule 
‘‘puts a burdensome disadvantage on 3d 
artwork,’’ and ‘‘promot[es] an outmoded 
concept of art as binary.’’
16
The 
Copyright Alliance also sought ‘‘[m]ore 
clarification’’ on how ‘‘burdensome’’ the 
examination process is for three- 
dimensional works versus two- 
dimensional works to ‘‘better 
understand why these works have been 
excluded.’’
17
Other commenters, 
however, appeared satisfied with the 
types of works included in the NPRM.
18
 
The Office understands stakeholders’ 
desire to maximizes group registration 
options, but declines to expand the rule 
to permit inclusion of three-dimensional 
and architectural works. First, a 
reasonable limit on the eligible types of 
works within a group is necessary to 
manage the administrative burden of 
examining group registrations. Inclusion 
of three-dimensional and architectural 
works in this group registration option 
would increase the time and cost of 
examination, as consideration of such 
works demands the application of legal 
standards that are not generally at issue 
for two-dimensional works. For 
instance, examiners considering three- 
dimensional and architectural works 
must often determine whether the works 
are useful articles, works of artistic 
craftsmanship, or building designs. In 
addition to applying the originality 
standard, consideration of architectural 
works requires examiners to determine 
whether the works’ stationary habitual 
structures are intended for permanency 
and designed for human occupancy.
19
 
Likewise, examining works of applied 
art requires examiners to apply the 
Supreme Court’s two-step separability 
test to determine whether they serve a 
useful purpose or whether they contain 
pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features 
that can be identified and separated 
from the article’s utilitarian aspects.
20
 
These issues do not generally arise in 
evaluation of claims for two- 
dimensional works. 
Second, among the justifications for 
creating a group registration option for 
two-dimensional art is that visual artists 
are often prolific creators who produce 
a significant number of works each 
year.
21
But the same premise does not 
appear to hold with respect to three- 
dimensional artworks. As the NPRM 
notes, the Coalition previously 
submitted survey results indicating that 
most three-dimensional artists produce 
between one and fifty works per year.

Kernochan Center observed that the type of works

under the Group Registration of Unpublished 
Works (‘‘GRUW’’) application. It also requested that 
the Office acknowledge that examination times 
under the proposed group registration option ‘‘may 
be lower than GRUW examination times,’’ due to 
the former’s restrictions on the types of works 
permitted. Id. at 3. This assumption, however, may not be apt. Two-dimensional artwork accounts for 
the vast majority of claims submitted to the Visual 
Arts Division on the GRUW application and, as of 
yet, there is no basis to conclude that the amount 
of time needed to examine ten works submitted via 
GRUW or Group Registration of Two-Dimensional 
Artwork (‘‘GR2D’’) will be markedly different.

communicating with the applicant. Id. at 11794 & n.60. The Office’s position on this portion of the 
rulemaking and any responsive comments are 
discussed in a subsequent subsection.

Coalition Comments at 21–22. 
37
Id. 
Evidence submitted in response to the 
current NPRM does not undermine the 
Office’s conclusion or establish that 
three-dimensional works are now 
created or distributed more rapidly. 
Although the Coalition provided 
updated survey results indicating that at 
least some artists create large numbers 
of works, several features of the new 
survey make it less relevant than the 
group’s prior survey.
23
The new survey 
did not distinguish between 
respondents who typically create three- 
dimensional works and those who 
typically create two-dimensional works; 
and the survey sought information on 
‘‘the greatest number of works [respondents] have created in one 
month’’ rather than their average rate of 
creation.
24
The question further 
instructed respondents to ‘‘includ[e] 
preliminary works (rough sketches, 
drafts, comps)’’ as well ‘‘final versions 
that may be shown to clients or others 
at any point in time or offered for 
sale.’’
25
The routine rate of production 
of two- and three-dimensional works 
appears to meaningfully differ and, at 
this time, stakeholders have not 
demonstrated a distinct need to include 
three-dimensional and architectural 
works in the new group registration 
option. To the extent that artists who 
create three-dimensional works produce 
a large number of preliminary works, 
the Office notes that some of these 
works may be eligible for an existing 
group registration option. The Group 
Registration of Unpublished Works 
(‘‘GRUW’’) option allows creators to 
register up to ten sculptural works 
before they have been published, if all 
other requirements and eligibility 
criteria are met. 
2. Number of Works That May Be 
Included 
The NPRM proposed that an applicant 
be permitted to include up to ten 
published pictorial or graphic works in 
each application. Several commenters 
requested modification of this 
requirement to include a greater number 
of works. Professors Gard and D’Amico 
recommended that the limit be 
increased to twenty works, similar to 
the Group Registration for Works on an 
Album of Music (‘‘GRAM’’) option.
26
 
The National Society of Entertainment 
and Arts Lawyers (‘‘NSEAL’’) proposed 
allowing applicants to register up to 
twenty-five works per application.
27
 
The Coalition suggested that the 
application permit ‘‘up to 100 works,’’ 
stating that this limit would 
‘‘accommodate the majority of 
artists.’’
28
Other commenters suggested 
that the proposed limit was too low but 
did not propose a specific alternative. 
The Copyright Alliance asserted that the 
limit was ‘‘too small’’ to make it a 
‘‘sufficiently beneficial registration 
option,’’ particularly when viewed in 
combination with the proposed rule’s 
other limitations.
29
The Kernochan 
Center for Law, Media and the Arts 
asked that the Office ‘‘permit more 
works to be registered.’’
30
 
In response, the Office has modified 
the final rule to allow for up to twenty 
works per group. This number strikes an 
appropriate balance between making 
registration more accessible for creators 
and taking into account the Office’s 
administrative capabilities.
31
As stated 
in the NPRM, examining visual art, 
including two-dimensional artwork, is a 
time-consuming process that requires 
care.
32
Examiners must determine 
whether each work contains sufficient 
copyrightable authorship; this can 
involve a range of complex issues, such 
as determining the extent of any 
derivative authorship.
33
Increasing the 
number of permitted works to twenty is 
likely to increase the time necessary to 
examine some claims, but the Office is 
persuaded that this change is also likely 
to facilitate registration of more works— 
including works by creators who might 
not otherwise use the registration 
system. The Office will monitor 
utilization of the new group registration 
option to determine whether this 
number provides an effective limit, and 
whether the group option’s application 
fee is sufficient to account for 
corresponding examination times. 
3. Title Requirements 
The proposed rule stated that 
applicants must provide the title for 
each work included in the group and 
that the electronic registration system 
would automatically add a title for the 
group as a whole that consists of the 
‘‘title of the first work listed in the 
application followed by the phrase ‘and 
[NUMBER] other published works’ 
(depending on how many titles are 
entered in the application).’’
34
The title 
for the group as a whole would be used 
to identify the registration in the online 
public record.
35
 
The Coalition expressed concern 
about the automatic addition of the title 
for the group as a whole.
36
It stated that 
the proposed rule’s approach of using 
the title of the first work listed in the 
application is problematic, as it ‘‘may 
have no connection to the other works 
in the group and may not clearly 
describe the grouping’’ and ‘‘will likely 
result in mistakes.’’
37
The Coalition 
urged the Office to instead allow artists 
to choose their own name for the group 
of works, consistent with naming

46
Coalition Comments at 22–23; Copyright 
Alliance Comments at 4 & n.2. See NPRM at 11791, 11794. 
47
This requirement is consistent with several 
other group registration options. See, e.g., 37 CFR 
202.4(i)(6) (necessitating that applicants for group 
registrations of published photographs ‘‘specify the 
earliest and latest date that the photographs were 
published’’), (j)(2) (explaining that under the group 
registration for short online literary works 
applicants must ‘‘identify the earliest and latest 
date that the works were published’’). 
48
This requirement allows the Office to ensure 
compliance with the rule’s calendar-year period. It 
is also consistent with other group registration 
options. See, e.g., id. at 202.4(i)(10) (requiring applicants for group registration of published 
photographs to provide the title, file name, and 
month and year of publication for each photograph 
in the group), (j)(8) (requiring applicants of the 
group registration for short online literary works to 
provide the publication date of each work when 
providing the title and file name for each work). 
49
Should applicants choose to provide any 
additional information, such as the specific day 
and/or year that a particular work was published, 
that information may be added in the ‘‘Note to 
Copyright Office’’ section. 
50
To add the nation of first publication, 
applicants should select the name of the 
appropriate country from the drop-down menu 
marked ‘‘Nation of First Publication.’’ If the works 
were published in multiple countries, the names of 
the other countries may be provided in the ‘‘Note 
to Copyright Office’’ section. 
51
See Kernochan Center Comments at 3 (expressing skepticism of the proposed timeframe, 
given that other group registration options have 
longer timeframes, and recommending instead that 
the Office ‘‘confer with authors of two-dimensional 
works to understand what publication timeline is 
reasonable’’); Joshua Kaufman Comments 
(explaining that the timeframe renders the group 
registration option inapplicable to ‘‘almost all’’ fine 
artists, as they ‘‘rarely’’ publish works within thirty 
days); Copyright Alliance Comments at 9–10 
(stating that the proposed timeframe is ‘‘too 
restrictive’’ and ‘‘extremely burdensome’’ because 
artists’ creative processes often exceeds thirty days). 
C.f. Jason Aquilino Comments (approving of 30-day period). 
52
See AMI Comments at 2 (90-day timeframe would ‘‘allow creators more opportunity to 
efficiently group multiple iterations and derivatives 
of the same work into the same application,’’ 
resulting in fewer registration applications and 
simplifying examiners’ review processes); Coalition 
Comments at 3, 12, 27 (one calendar year timeframe 
aligns with other group registration options, such as 
GRPPH); NSEAL Comments at 2 (one calendar year 
timeframe alleviates the burden on applicants who 
may not publish within the proposed timeframe 
and furthers the Office’s ‘‘interest in protecting the 
quality and utility of public record’’). Other 
commenters advocated for enlarging the time 
period, but did not provide a specific 
recommendation. See supra note 51. 53
Elizabeth Townsend Gard et al. Comments at 3, 
15, 27, 33 (proposing that the Office limit the thirty- 
day timeframe because it ‘‘does not reflect artists’ 
needs’’ and when viewed in conjunction with the 
proposed number of works permitted under this 
option). 
54
AMI Comments at 2. 
55
At this time, given administrative capabilities, 
the Office cannot expand the option to cover works 
published outside of the calendar-year range. 
56
Please note that to claim statutory damages or 
attorney’s fees in a copyright infringement lawsuit, 
a work must be registered before the infringement 
began or within three months after the first 
publication of the work. See 17 U.S.C. 412(c), 504, Published Photographs (‘‘GRPPH’’) 
option. 
The Office has revised this aspect of 
the rule to address this concern. The 
application will not add a system- 
generated title for the group as a whole, 
but instead will require applicants to 
create their own title for the group, 
similar to the GRPPH option. 
4. Publication Requirements 
In the NPRM, the Office proposed that 
the new group registration option be 
available only when all works in a 
group have been published within a 
thirty-day period.
38
The NPRM further 
explained the publication requirement, 
stating: 
[T]he Office will generally accept that a 
work has been published when a visual artist 
distributes a copy to a client or other entity 
and authorizes them to retain, reproduce, 
redistribute, or display that copy (subject to 
any licenses or other restrictions that the 
artist may impose).
39
 
The NPRM also proposed that 
applicants be required to provide the 
earliest and most recent publication 
dates of works within the group, and the 
country where the works were first 
published.
40
 
i. Publication 
The Coalition noted their appreciation 
for the NPRM’s ‘‘clear definition of 
‘publication’ for artwork’’ and the 
Office’s effort ‘‘to help creative 
professionals more clearly understand 
the meaning’’ of the term.
41
Still, 
commenters like the Copyright Alliance 
observed that ‘‘it [is] extremely difficult 
for creators of two-dimensional works to 
know when to register their works,’’ as 
‘‘[v]isual artists often work on deadlines 
that are fluid and have quick 
turnaround times. Moreover, these 
artists often do not know when the 
revision process will end, resulting in a 
final version of the work.’’
42
In light of 
the challenges some artists face in 
determining the date of their works’ 
publication, Professors Gard and 
D’Amico suggested that the Office be 
‘‘lenient’’ when people incorrectly 
identify a work as published or 
unpublished.’’
43
 
As the Office has stated in previous 
rulemakings, section 409 of the 
Copyright Act requires registration 
applications to inquire about a work’s 
publication status, including the date 
and nation of the work’s first 
publication.
44
The Office, however, will 
generally accept an applicant’s 
statements about publication as true 
unless those statements are contradicted 
by information contained within the 
registration materials.
45
 
Two commenters asked the Office for 
clarification on whether applicants must 
list the specific publication date for 
each work or whether applicants need 
only provide the earliest and most 
recent publication date for works within 
the group.
46
The Office has clarified the 
final rule. The rule requires applicants 
to provide a date range for all the works 
within the group; to do so, applicants 
must state the earliest and most recent 
publication date (i.e., month, day, and year) for the group.
47
When providing 
title information for each work within 
the group, applicants must also identify 
the month that each work was first 
published.
48
Applicants need not 
provide the exact publication date for 
each individual work.
49
As stated in the 
NPRM, applicants are also required to 
identify the country where the works 
were first published.
50
 
ii. Expansion From Thirty-Day Limit to 
One-Year Limit 
In response to the NPRM’s suggestion 
that works in a group must be published 
within a 30-day period, a number of 
commenters advocated for a longer time 
period.
51
Commenters proposed specific 
time periods ranging from ninety (90) 
days to one calendar year.
52
One 
commenter suggested that the Office 
eliminate the time period limitation 
altogether.
53
Association of Medical 
Illustrators asserted that enlarging the 
time frame would cause ‘‘no additional 
burden’’ for examiners, who have to 
determine whether each work within 
the group falls within the permissible 
publication date range, regardless of 
what that range is.
54
 
In light of this input, the final rule 
permits works published within the 
same calendar year to be registered as a 
group.
55
In other words, for a group of 
works published in 2025, both the work 
with the earliest publication date and 
the work with the most recent 
publication date must have been 
published in 2025 (i.e., between 01/01/ 2025 and 12/31/2025).
56
Applicants will

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES159387 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Rules and Regulations 505. Thus, to maximize potential benefits under the 
law, applicants may choose to file claims on a 
quarterly basis (once every three months). 
57
As explained in the NPRM, this rule is 
consistent with the basic principle that an author 
may always be named as the copyright claimant, 
even if they do not own any of the exclusive rights 
when the claim is submitted. 
58
The rule does not permit applicants to register 
works created by an individual author together with 
works created pursuant to a work made for hire 
agreement. For example, if a small business 
commissioned a set of fabric designs through a 
work made for hire agreement and acquired another 
set of designs through an assignment of copyright 
from an individual author, the applicant would 
need to divide those designs into two groups and 
submit a separate GR2D application for each 
group—one with the small business named as the 
author/claimant and the work made for hire 
question answered ‘‘yes,’’ and the other with the 
individual author named as the author/claimant 
with the question answered ‘‘no.’’

be required to identify the month that 
each work was published, and they may

date in the ‘‘Note to Copyright Office.’’ 
The Office believes that this approach 
will ease some of the purported burdens 
faced by artists, while still protecting 
the quality and the utility of the public 
record. 
5. Authorship and Ownership 
Requirements 
The proposed rule would require that 
all works in a group be created by the 
same author, and the author be named 
as the copyright claimant even if a 
transfer of ownership has occurred.
57
 
Works made for hire would be eligible 
for this option, so long as the employer 
or commissioning party is named as the 
author and claimant on the 
application.
58
The option, however, 
would not be available to works created 
by two or more authors (i.e., joint works). 
Commenters praised the Office’s 
proposal to permit works made for hire 
under the option.
59
Four commenters, 
however, urged the Office to go further, 
allowing group registration of jointly 
authored works. These commenters 
noted that ‘‘many visual artists . . . 
collaborate . . . and frequently partner 
with other artists.’’
60
Some contended 
that the rules for the GR2D and GRUW 
options should be consistent;
61
others 
requested the eligibility criteria for 
GR2D to mirror that of GRAM, which 
permits works made for hire and works 
created by multiple authors if there is a 
common joint author.
62
 
Having considered these requests, the 
Office maintains its conclusion that 
works created by common or joint 
authors should be ineligible for the 
GR2D option. Joint authorship claims 
add complexity to an already 
multifaceted examination, resulting in 
greater burden on the Office’s resources. 
Additionally, the Office is not 
persuaded that there is a compelling 
need to allow joint authorship claims 
within the GR2D option, in light of its 
experience with Standard and GRUW 
applications for visual art works—the 
vast majority of which name only one 
author per application.
63
Each group 
registration option is designed to 
accommodate copyright owners’ 
requests balanced against the Office’s 
need for an efficient method of 
examining, indexing, and cataloging 
each work—and not every group option 
entails the same balance. As described 
in the NPRM, the Office tailored the 
proposed GR2D rule to address the 
challenges facing individual artists and 
small businesses in registering two- 
dimensional artwork one work at a time, 
in light of concerns that these claimants 
often lack the time and resources 
required to register works 
individually.
64
While the Office 
recognizes commenters’ desire for a rule 
that sweeps even more broadly, the 
Office must balance the interests of 
copyright owners with the 
administrative burden of 
implementation. In light of the wide 
range of pictorial and graphic works, the 
doubling of the number of works 
permitted in each group in the final 
rule, and the modest fee set for this 
option, some limits on the types of 
claims permitted are necessary. 
B. Filing Fee 
The NPRM proposed an $85 filing 
fee.
65
It explained that $85 is the fee that 
currently applies to GRUW claims, and 
that the expected workflow associated 
with examining groups of two- 
dimensional artworks and GRUW 
claims are similar.
66
 
Commenters generally advocated for a 
lower fee.
67
The Coalition and the 
Copyright Alliance argued that the fee is 
‘‘much too high, especially given the 
ten-work and thirty-day time period 
limitations.’’
68
The Copyright Alliance 
acknowledged that ‘‘the rate for GR2D 
would be the same as GRUW at $8.50 
per work (if ten works are grouped 
together),’’ but claimed that that rate ‘‘is 
on the costlier side when compared to 
other group registration options.’’
69
 
The final rule retains the $85 fee, but 
responds to stakeholders’ concerns 
about affordability by allowing for the 
registration of more works per group. By 
amending the rule to permit applicants 
to register up to twenty works published 
within one calendar year,
70
the Office 
has effectively reduced the per-work 
cost of registration by half, to $4.25 per 
work. 
C. Application Requirements 
The NPRM explained that the Office 
plans to adapt one of its existing group 
registration application forms to avoid 
delaying the implementation of the new 
group option for visual artists. 
Specifically, the Office stated that it 
would modify the GRUW application to 
create the GR2D form. While the 
Copyright Alliance advised the Office to 
start from scratch, other commenters 
urged the Office to model the GR2D 
application after the GRAM, GRPPH, or 
Contributions to Periodicals forms, all of 
which permit inclusion of works 
published within a twelve-month 
period.
71
 
The Office has tailored the 
application to suit the eligibility and 
application requirements described in 
the final rule. Specific instructions on 
how to complete the new application 
will be provided on the application 
itself and through the Office’s 
traditional channels, including its 
website, Circulars, and/or Chapter 1100 
of the Compendium of U.S. Copyright 
Office Practices (‘‘Compendium’’). In 
addition, the Office intends to offer a 
video providing step-by-step 
instructions on how to complete the 
form.

Additionally, reasoning that the system would 
automatically add a group title to the GR2D 
application, the NPRM stated that the examiner 
would remove any ‘‘collection’’ titles provided 
instead of or in addition to titles for the individual 
works. In response to commenters’ request, the 
system will not insert an automated group title. 
Instead, applicants should provide their own.

Id. at 604. D. Amending or Annotating the 
Registration Record 
Finally, the NPRM stated that the 
examiner would be permitted to amend 
or annotate the registration record 
without corresponding with the 
applicant, in certain circumstances. 
First, if an applicant were to submit a 
work that is ineligible for this group 
registration option, or submit more than 
the allowable number of works, the 
examiner would be permitted to remove 
the ineligible or additional titles and 
deposits from the registration record 
and send a post-registration email to the 
applicant explaining why the change 
was made. Second, if the titles and file 
names did not match, the examiner 
would be permitted to remove the 
mismatched titles and files from the 
registration record and send a post- 
registration email to explain the 
amendment.
72
Third, if an applicant 
were to submit two-dimensional 
identifying material depicting a three- 
dimensional work of authorship (such 
as a drawing of a toy or a piece of 
jewelry), the examiner would be 
permitted to add an annotation to the 
record confirming that the registration 
does not cover any three-dimensional 
authorship that is shown in the deposit. 
Allowing examiners to avoid 
superfluous communications with 
applicants in these limited 
circumstances promotes efficient 
review, improving overall processing 
times for all applicants.
73
 
Multiple commenters raised concern 
that these policies would ‘‘allow 
copyright examiners to make unilateral 
changes to a copyright registration 
application to correct perceived 
mistakes or misunderstandings without 
any input from or correspondence with 
the applicant,’’ which ‘‘could result in 
a registration certificate that does not 
reflect the applicant’s intentions in 
filing the application.’’
74
The Copyright 
Alliance argued that ‘‘not allowing 
creators to correct mistakes in their 
applications before the registration 
certificate is issued or the application is 
rejected’’ may result in material losses 
for applicants seeking statutory damages 
in infringement actions.
75
Commenters 
urged the Office to clarify that 
‘‘examiners are not permitted to make unilateral changes to a group 
registration of two-dimensional artwork 
but, instead, must communicate with 
the applicant before making any 
changes, just as examiners do with 
every other type of registration 
application.’’
76
 
While the Office acknowledges these 
concerns, authorizing an appropriate 
level of examiner discretion is essential 
to ensure the efficient processing of 
claims. This is especially true here, 
where the permitted examiner 
amendments and annotations merely 
enforce the group option criteria. 
Moreover, contrary to commenters’ 
suggestions, the latitude the new rule 
allows examiners is consistent with 
longstanding Office policy and practice. 
The Compendium already permits examiners discretion to amend the 
registration record without 
communicating with an applicant where 
the issue may be clearly resolved via 
examination.
77
Likewise, the 
Compendium permits examiners to ‘‘annotate an application without 
communicating with the applicant if the 
annotation does not cast doubt on or 
raise a question concerning the validity 
of the registration.’’
78
 
It would be infeasible for examiners to 
provide extensive correspondence when 
examining group registration claims 
involving multiple works. To the extent 
that they do so when examining 
Standard and Single Applications, that 
process imposes less administrative 
burdens than group registration. The 
somewhat more limited communication 
described in the final rule is consistent 
with the Office’s implementation of 
these practices in its administration of 
the GRUW option. Based on this 
experience, the Office has found that an 
appropriate level of examiner discretion 
ensures an efficient and productive 
examination process. 
The Office is strongly committed to 
assisting applicants as they navigate the 
registration system. It encourages 
applicants to take full advantage of the 
resources that the Office provides to aid 
them in registration, including the 
Compendium and educational Circulars, the webinars and other educational 
materials available on the Office’s 
website, and the dedicated specialists in 
the Office of Public Information and 
Education who are available to provide 
live, one-on-one support.

the Register of Copyrights has 
determined that a group of two- 
dimensional artwork may be registered 
in Class VA with one application, the 
required deposit, and the filing fee 
required by § 201.3(c) of this chapter if 
the following conditions are met: 
(1) All the works in the group must be 
two-dimensional pictorial or graphic 
works, and each work must be 
comprised of no more than one pictorial 
or graphic work. The group may include 
up to twenty works, and the application 
must specify the total number of works 
that are included in the group. The 
group may not include any three- 
dimensional pictorial, graphic, or 
sculptural works, any architectural 
works, technical drawings, or works of 
applied art, any works comprised of 
multiple pictorial or graphic works, 
including compilations, collective 
works, databases, or websites. Claims in 
any form of authorship other than ‘‘2D 
artwork’’ or claims in the selection, 
coordination, or arrangement of the 
group as a whole will not be permitted 
on the application. 
(2) The applicant must provide a title 
for each work in the group. 
(3) All the works must be created by 
the same author, and the author must be 
named as the copyright claimant for 
each work in the group. The group may 
not include any works created by more 
than one author. The works may be 
registered as works made for hire if they 
are identified in the application as such. 
(4) All the works must be published 
within one calendar year, the applicant 
must specify the earliest and latest date 
that the works were published during 
the year and the month of publication 
for each work. 
(5) The applicant must complete and 
submit the online application 
designated for a group of two- 
dimensional artwork. The application 
may be submitted by any of the parties 
listed in § 202.3(c)(1). 
(6) The applicant must submit one 
complete copy of each work. The works 
must be assembled in an orderly form 
with each work contained in a separate 
electronic file. The file name for each 
work must match the title as submitted 
on the application. All of the works 
must be submitted in one of the 
electronic formats approved by the 
Office, and they must be uploaded to 
the electronic registration system. The 
file size for each uploaded file must not 
exceed 500 megabytes; the files may be 
compressed to comply with this 
requirement. 
(7) In an exceptional case, the 
Copyright Office may waive the online 
filing requirement set forth in paragraph 
(l)(5) of this section or may grant special 
relief from the deposit requirement 
under § 202.20(d) of this chapter,

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION 
CONTACT. 
B. What is EPA’s authority for taking 
this action? 
In accordance with the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) 
sections 408(e) and 408(l)(6) of, 21 
U.S.C. 346a(e) and 346a(l)(6), EPA is 
establishing time-limited tolerances for 
residues of flupyradifurone, including 
its metabolites and degradates, in or on 
sugarcane, cane at 3 parts per million 
(ppm) and sugarcane, molasses at 90 
ppm. These time-limited tolerances 
expire on December 31, 2028. 
C. How can I file an objection or hearing 
request? 
Under section 408(g) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 
21 U.S.C. 346a, any person may file an 
objection to any aspect of this regulation 
and may also request a hearing on those 
objections. If you fail to file an objection 
to the final rule within the time period 
specified in the final rule, you will have 
waived the right to raise any issues 
resolved in the final rule. You must file 
your objection or request a hearing on 
this regulation in accordance with the 
instructions provided in 40 CFR part 
178. To ensure proper receipt by EPA, 
you must identify docket ID number 
EPA–HQ–OPP–2025–1973 in the subject 
line on the first page of your 
submission. All objections and requests 
for a hearing must be in writing and 
must be received by the Hearing Clerk 
on or before February 17, 2026. 
The EPA’s Office of Administrative 
Law Judges (OALJ), in which the 
Hearing Clerk is housed, urges parties to 
file and serve documents by electronic 
means only, notwithstanding any other 
particular requirements set forth in 
other procedural rules governing those 
proceedings. See ‘‘Revised Order Urging Electronic Filing and Service,’’ dated 
June 22, 2023, which can be found at

II. Background and Statutory Findings 
Section 408(l)(6) of FFDCA requires 
EPA to establish a time-limited 
tolerance or exemption from the 
requirement for a tolerance for pesticide 
chemical residues in food that will 
result from the use of a pesticide under 
an emergency exemption granted by 
EPA under FIFRA section 18. Such 
tolerances can be established without 
providing notice or period for public 
comment. EPA does not intend for its 
actions related to FIFRA section 18 
time-limited tolerances to set binding 
precedents for the application of FFDCA 
section 408 and the safety standard to 
other tolerances and exemptions. 
Section 408(e) of FFDCA allows EPA to 
establish a tolerance or an exemption 
from the requirement of a tolerance on 
its own initiative (i.e., without having received any petition from an outside 
party). 
FFDCA Section 408(b)(2)(A)(i) allows 
EPA to establish a tolerance (the legal 
limit for a pesticide chemical residue in 
or on a food) only if EPA determines 
that the tolerance is ‘‘safe.’’ Section 
408(b)(2)(A)(ii) of FFDCA defines ‘‘safe’’ 
to mean that ‘‘there is a reasonable 
certainty that no harm will result from 
aggregate exposure to the pesticide 
chemical residue, including all 
anticipated dietary exposures and all 
other exposures for which there is 
reliable information.’’ This includes 
exposure through drinking water and in 
residential settings but does not include 
occupational exposure. Section 
408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA requires EPA to 
give special consideration to exposure 
of infants and children to the pesticide 
chemical residue in establishing a 
tolerance and to ‘‘ensure that there is a 
reasonable certainty that no harm will 
result to infants and children from 
aggregate exposure to the pesticide 
chemical residue. . . .’’ 
Section 18 of FIFRA authorizes EPA 
to exempt any Federal or State agency 
from any provision of FIFRA if EPA 
determines that ‘‘emergency conditions 
exist which require such exemption.’’ 
EPA has established regulations 
governing such emergency exemptions 
in 40 CFR part 166. 
III. Emergency Exemption for 
Flupyradifurone on Sugarcane and 
FFDCA Tolerances 
The Louisiana Department of 
Agriculture and Forestry (LDAF) 
utilized a crisis exemption under FIFRA 
for the use of flupyradifurone to control 
West Indian canefly, sugarcane aphid, 
and yellow sugarcane aphid. The 
applicant asserts that an emergency pest 
situation exists due to simultaneous 
widespread infestations of hemipteran 
insects such as caneflies and aphids. 
According to LDAF, there is a lack of 
available insecticides to control these 
pests that can fit with integrated pest 
management in sugarcane. Without an 
effective control, Louisiana sugarcane 
growers affected by uncontrolled 
caneflies and aphids face significant 
economic yield losses. 
After having reviewed the crisis 
exemption, EPA concurred on the crisis 
exemption and determined that an 
emergency condition exists for this

As part of its evaluation of the 
emergency exemption application, EPA 
assessed the potential risks presented by 
residues of flupyradifurone in or on 
sugarcane, cane and sugarcane, 
molasses. In doing so, EPA considered 
the safety standard in FFDCA section 
408(b)(2), and EPA decided that the 
necessary tolerances under FFDCA 
section 408(l)(6) would be consistent 
with the safety standard and with 
FIFRA section 18. Consistent with the 
need to move quickly on the emergency 
exemption in order to address an urgent 
non-routine situation and to ensure that 
the resulting food is safe and lawful, 
EPA is issuing these tolerances without 
notice and opportunity for public 
comment as provided in FFDCA section 
408(l)(6). Although these time-limited 
tolerances expire on December 31, 2028, 
under FFDCA section 408(l)(5), residues 
of the pesticide not in excess of the 
amount specified in the tolerances 
remaining in or on sugarcane, cane and 
sugarcane, molasses after that date will 
not be unlawful, provided the pesticide 
was applied in a manner that was lawful 
under FIFRA, and the residues do not 
exceed a level that was authorized by 
these time-limited tolerances at the time 
of that application. EPA will take action 
to revoke the time-limited tolerances 
earlier if any experience with, scientific 
data on, or other relevant information 
about this pesticide indicates that the 
residues are not safe. 
Because these time-limited tolerances 
are being approved under emergency 
conditions, EPA has not made any 
decisions about whether 
flupyradifurone meets FIFRA’s 
registration requirements for use on 
sugarcane or whether permanent 
tolerances for this use would be 
appropriate. Under these circumstances, 
EPA does not believe that these time- 
limited tolerance decisions serve as a 
basis for registration of flupyradifurone 
by a State for special local needs under 
FIFRA section 24(c). Nor do these 
tolerances by themselves serve as the 
authority for persons in any State other 
than Louisiana to use this pesticide on 
sugarcane under FIFRA section 18 
absent the issuance of an emergency 
exemption applicable within that State. 
For additional information regarding the 
emergency exemption for 
flupyradifurone, contact the Agency’s 
Registration Division at the address

FOR FURTHER 
INFORMATION CONTACT. 
IV. Aggregate Risk Assessment and 
Determination of Safety 
Section 408(b)(2)(A)(i) of FFDCA 
allows EPA to establish a tolerance (the 
legal limit for a pesticide chemical 
residue in or on a food) only if EPA 
determines that the tolerance is ‘‘safe.’’ 
Section 408(b)(2)(A)(ii) of FFDCA 
defines ‘‘safe’’ to mean that ‘‘there is a 
reasonable certainty that no harm will 
result from aggregate exposure to the 
pesticide chemical residue, including 
all anticipated dietary exposures and all 
other exposures for which there is 
reliable information.’’ This includes 
exposure through drinking water and in 
residential settings but does not include 
occupational exposure. Section 
408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA requires EPA to 
give special consideration to exposure 
of infants and children to the pesticide 
chemical residue in establishing a 
tolerance and to ‘‘ensure that there is a 
reasonable certainty that no harm will 
result to infants and children from 
aggregate exposure to the pesticide 
chemical residue. . . .’’ 
Consistent with FFDCA section 
408(b)(2)(D), and the factors specified 
therein, EPA has reviewed the available 
scientific data and other relevant 
information in support of this action. 
EPA has sufficient data to assess the 
hazards of and to make a determination 
on aggregate exposure expected as a 
result of the use proposed by this 
emergency exemption request and the 
time-limited tolerances for residues of 
flupyradifurone on sugarcane, cane at 3 
ppm and sugarcane, molasses at 90 
ppm. EPA’s assessment of exposures 
and risks associated with establishing 
these time-limited tolerances follows. 
On September 23, 2016 (81 FR 65552) 
(FRL–9951–68), and August 21, 2020 
(85 FR 51668–51672) (FRL–10010–98), 
EPA published final rules that 
established tolerances for residues of 
flupyradifurone in or on multiple 
commodities based on the Agency’s 
determination that aggregate exposure to 
flupyradifurone resulting from the 
residues subject to those tolerances is 
safe for the U.S. general population, 
including infants and children. The 
toxicity profile for flupyradifurone has 
not changed since the September 23, 
2016 (81 FR 65552) (FRL–9951–68), rule 
was published, therefore EPA is relying 
upon the discussion of that profile (Unit 
III) and the identified toxicological 
endpoints (Unit III) as part of this 
rulemaking. 
EPA’s most recent exposure 
assessment for flupyradifurone appears 
in the comprehensive risk assessment 
dated April 6, 2023, titled: 
‘‘Flupyradifurone. Human Health Risk 
Assessment for the Proposed Use on 
Indoor and Outdoor Non-Food Uses,’’ as 
that assessment included dietary and 
aggregate exposures to flupyradifurone 
in or on multiple agricultural and non- 
agricultural commodities, including for 
flupyradifurone on sugarcane in 
Louisiana submitted in 2021 (sugarcane, 
cane at 3 ppm and sugarcane, molasses 
at 90 ppm). 
For aggregate risk assessment, risk 
estimates resulting from food, drinking 
water, and residential uses are 
combined. Acute, short- and 
intermediate-term, and long-term 
(chronic) aggregate assessments were 
performed for flupyradifurone, and no 
risk estimates of concern were 
identified. Further information about 
EPA’s risk assessment and 
determination of safety supporting these 
tolerances can be found at http://
www.regulations.gov in the document titled ‘‘Flupyradifurone. Human Health 
Risk Assessment for the Proposed Use 
on Indoor and Outdoor Non-Food 
Uses,’’ dated April 6, 2023, and 
identified by docket ID EPA–HQ–OPP– 
2022–0444. 
In the 2023 assessment, EPA 
conducted unrefined acute and partially 
refined chronic dietary analyses for all 
current uses of flupyradifurone together 
with the emergency use in or on 
sugarcane, cane and sugarcane, 
molasses. The assessments incorporated 
tolerance-level residues, average 
residues for some commodities 
(chronic), Health Effects Division 
default and empirical processing factors, 
and conservative drinking water 
estimates, and assumed that 100% of 
the proposed crops were treated. The 
results of the acute and chronic analyses 
do not exceed the Agency’s level of 
concern. That is, less than 100% of the 
acute population adjusted dose (aPAD) 
or less than 100% of the chronic 
population adjusted dose (cPAD) are not 
of concern for the general U.S. 
population and all population 
subgroups. At the 95th percentile of 
exposure, the acute dietary (i.e., food and drinking water) risk estimates 
utilized 27% of the aPAD for the general 
U.S. population and 55% of the aPAD 
for children 1–2 years old, the most 
highly exposed population subgroup. 
The chronic dietary (i.e., food and drinking water) risk estimates utilized 
30% of the cPAD for the general U.S. 
population and 70% of the cPAD for 
children 1–2 years old, the group with 
the highest exposed population 
subgroup. 
The aggregate exposure assessment for 
flupyradifurone is based on food and 
drinking water as well as residential 
uses. No acute or long-term (chronic) 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  15:45 Dec 18, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\19DER1.SGM 19DER1
lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES159392 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Rules and Regulations residential exposures are expected, 
therefore acute and chronic aggregate 
risks are equivalent to acute and chronic 
dietary exposure estimates, respectively. 
Since the dermal and incidental oral 
point of departures are the same for both 
short- and intermediate-term durations, 
the short-term aggregate risk estimates 
are considered protective of any 
potential intermediate-term exposures 
and risks. Aggregate short-term 
residential exposure to adults 
(residential handlers) and children 
(residential post-application exposures) 
plus background (chronic) dietary 
exposure yields margins of exposure 
(MOEs) of 270 for adults, 180 for 
children (1 to <2 years old), and 210 for 
children (6 to <11 years old); no 
aggregate risk estimates are of concern 
because EPA considers MOEs of less 
than 100 to be of concern for aggregate 
risk. 
Therefore, based on the risk 
assessments and information described 
above, EPA concludes there is a 
reasonable certainty that no harm will 
result to the general U.S. population, or 
to infants and children from aggregate 
exposure to flupyradifurone residues. 
More detailed information on the 
subject action to establish time-limited 
tolerances in or on sugarcane, cane and 
sugarcane, molasses can be found at 
http://www.regulations.gov in the document titled ‘‘Flupyradifurone: 
Human Health Risk Assessment for 
Section 18 Emergency Exemption 
Request for Use on Sugarcane in 
Louisiana.’’ This document can be 
found in docket ID number EPA–HQ– 
OPP–2025–1973. 
V. Other Considerations 
A. Analytical Enforcement Methodology 
An adequate enforcement 
methodology (Method RV–001–P10–03) 
is available to enforce the tolerance 
expression for flupyradifurone. This 
method uses high-performance liquid 
chromatography with tandem mass 
spectrometry to quantitate residues of 
flupyradifurone in various crops. This 
method may be requested from the 
Chief, Analytical Chemistry Branch, 
Environmental Science Center, 701 
Mapes Road, Ft. Meade, MD 20755– 
5350; telephone number: (410) 305– 
2905; email address: residuemethods@
epa.gov. 
B. International Residue Limits 
In making its tolerance decisions, EPA 
seeks to harmonize U.S. tolerances with 
international standards whenever 
possible, consistent with U.S. food 
safety standards and agricultural 
practices. EPA considers the 
international maximum residue limits 
(MRLs) established by the Codex 
Alimentarius Commission (Codex), as 
required by FFDCA section 408(b)(4). 
The Codex Alimentarius is a joint 
United Nations Food and Agriculture 
Organization/World Health 
Organization food standards program, 
and it is recognized as an international 
food safety standards-setting 
organization in trade agreements to 
which the United States is a party. EPA 
may establish a tolerance that is 
different from a Codex MRL; however, 
FFDCA section 408(b)(4) requires that 
EPA explain the reasons for departing 
from the Codex level. There are no 
Codex MRLs established on sugarcane. 
VI. Conclusion 
Therefore, time-limited tolerances are 
established for residues of 
flupyradifurone, in or on sugarcane, 
cane at 3 ppm and sugarcane, molasses 
at 90 ppm. These tolerances expire on 
December 31, 2028. 
VII. Statutory and Executive Order 
Reviews 
Additional information about these 
statutes and Executive Orders can be 
found at https://www.epa.gov/laws- 
regulations/laws-and-executive-orders. 
A. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory 
Planning and Review 
This action is exempt from review 
under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 
51735, October 4, 1993), because it 
establishes a time-limited tolerance or 
an exemption from the requirement of a 
tolerance for pesticide chemical 
residues in food that will result from the 
use of a pesticide under an emergency 
exemption granted by EPA under FIFRA 
section 18. The Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) has exempted these 
types of actions from review under 
Executive Order 12866. 
B. Executive Order 14192: Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation 
Executive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, 
February 6, 2025) does not apply 
because actions that establish a 
tolerance under FFDCA section 408 are 
exempted from review under Executive 
Order 12866. 
C. Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) 
This action does not impose an 
information collection burden under the 
PRA 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., because it 
does not contain any information 
collection activities. 
D. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
Since tolerance actions that are 
established in accordance with FFDCA 
sections 408(e) and 408(1)(6), such as 
the tolerance in this final rule, do not 
require the issuance of a proposed rule, 
the requirements of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 
601 et seq., do not apply. E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
(UMRA) 
This action does not contain an 
unfunded mandate of $100 million or 
more (in 1995 dollars and adjusted 
annually for inflation) as described in 
UMRA, 2 U.S.C. 1531–1538 and does 
not significantly or uniquely affect small 
governments. The action imposes no 
enforceable duty on any State, local, or 
Tribal governments or on the private 
sector. 
F. Executive Order 13132: Federalism 
This action does not have federalism 
implications as specified in Executive 
Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 
1999), because it will not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, 
on the relationship between the 
National Government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
G. Executive Order 13175: Consultation 
and Coordination With Indian Tribal 
Governments 
This action does not have Tribal 
implications as specified in Executive 
Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 
2000) because it will not have 
substantial direct effects on Tribal 
governments, on the relationship 
between the Federal Government and 
the Indian Tribes, or on the distribution 
of power and responsibilities between 
the Federal Government and Indian 
Tribes. 
H. Executive Order 13045: Protection of 
Children From Environmental Health 
Risks and Safety Risks 
This action is not subject to Executive 
Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 
1997) because tolerance actions like this 
one are exempt from review under 
Executive Order 12866. However, EPA’s 
2021 Policy on Children’s Health applies to this action. This rule finalizes 
tolerance actions under the FFDCA, 
which requires EPA to give special 
consideration to exposure of infants and 
children to the pesticide chemical 
residue in establishing a tolerance and 
to ‘‘ensure that there is a reasonable 
certainty that no harm will result to 
infants and children from aggregate 
exposure to the pesticide chemical 
residue . . .’’ (FFDCA 408(b)(2)(C)). The 
Agency’s consideration is summarized 
in Unit IV.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION 
CONTACT. 
B. What is EPA’s authority for taking 
this action? 
EPA is issuing this rulemaking under 
section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 
346a. FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(A)(i) 
allows EPA to establish a tolerance (the 
legal limit for a pesticide chemical 
residue in or on a food) only if EPA 
determines that the tolerance is ‘‘safe.’’ 
FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(A)(ii) defines 
‘‘safe’’ to mean that ‘‘there is a 
reasonable certainty that no harm will 
result from aggregate exposure to the 
pesticide chemical residue, including 
all anticipated dietary exposures and all 
other exposures for which there is 
reliable information.’’ This includes 
exposure through drinking water and in 
residential settings but does not include 
occupational exposure. FFDCA section 
408(b)(2)(C) requires EPA to give special 
consideration to exposure of infants and 
children to the pesticide chemical 
residue in establishing a tolerance and 
to ‘‘ensure that there is a reasonable

C. How can I file an objection or hearing 
request? 
Under FFDCA section 408(g), 21 
U.S.C. 346a(g), any person may file an 
objection to any aspect of this regulation 
and may also request a hearing on those 
objections. If you fail to file an objection 
to the final rule within the time period 
specified in the final rule, you will have 
waived the right to raise any issues 
resolved in the final rule. You must file 
your objection or request a hearing on 
this regulation in accordance with the 
instructions provided in 40 CFR part 
178. To ensure proper receipt by EPA, 
you must identify docket ID number 
EPA–HQ–OPP–2024–0217 in the subject 
line on the first page of your 
submission. All objections and requests 
for a hearing must be in writing and 
must be received by the Hearing Clerk 
on or before February 17, 2026. 
The EPA’s Office of Administrative 
Law Judges (OALJ), in which the 
Hearing Clerk is housed, urges parties to 
file and serve documents by electronic 
means only, notwithstanding any other 
particular requirements set forth in 
other procedural rules governing those 
proceedings. See ‘‘Revised Order Urging 
Electronic Filing and Service,’’ dated 
June 22, 2023, which can be found at

II. Petitioned-For Tolerance 
In the Federal Register of July 3, 2025 
(90 FR 29515 (FRL–12474–05–OCSPP)), 
EPA issued a document pursuant to 
FFDCA section 408(d)(3), 21 U.S.C. 
346a(d)(3), announcing the filing of a 
pesticide petition (PP 4F9156) by the 
American Spice Trade Association. The 
petition requested that 40 CFR part 180 
be amended by establishing tolerances 
for residues of the insecticide 
thiamethoxam in or on pepper, black at 
0.1 ppm. That document referenced a 
summary of the petition that was 
prepared by the petitioner and is 
included in the docket. No comments 
were received in response to that notice 
of filing. 
III. Final Tolerance Action 
A. Aggregate Risk Assessment and 
Determination of Safety 
Consistent with FFDCA section 
408(b)(2)(D), and the factors specified 
therein, EPA has reviewed the available 
scientific data and other relevant 
information in support of this action. 
Based upon review of the data 
supporting the petition and in 
accordance with its authority under 
FFDCA section 408(d)(4)(A)(i), EPA is 
establishing a tolerance that varies from 
what the petitioner sought. Specifically, 
EPA is establishing a tolerance of 0.15 
ppm (versus the petitioned-for 0.1 ppm) 
because the monitoring data the 
tolerance is based upon demonstrate 
that a tolerance of 0.15 ppm is the 
appropriate level. 
EPA has determined that it has 
sufficient data to assess the hazards of 
and to make a determination on 
aggregate exposure for thiamethoxam, 
including exposure resulting from the 
tolerance established by this action. 
EPA’s assessment of exposures and risks 
associated with thiamethoxam is 
summarized in this unit. 
In an effort to streamline its 
publications in the Federal Register, 
EPA is not reprinting discussions 
previously published in other tolerance 
rulemakings for the same pesticide 
chemical. Where scientific information 
concerning a particular chemical 
remains unchanged, the content of those 
sections would not vary between 
tolerance rulemakings, and EPA 
considers referral back to those sections 
as sufficient to provide an explanation 
of the information EPA considered in 
making its safety determination for this 
new rulemaking. 
For thiamethoxam, EPA has 
previously published tolerance 
rulemakings in which EPA concluded, 
based on the available information, that 
there is a reasonable certainty that no 
harm would result from aggregate 
exposure to thiamethoxam and 
established tolerances for residues of 
that chemical. EPA is incorporating 
previously published sections from 
previous rulemakings as described 
further in this rulemaking, as they 
remain unchanged. 
Tolerances for residues of 
thiamethoxam are listed in 40 CFR 
180.565 and are expressed in terms of 
the combined residues of the insecticide 
thiamethoxam and its metabolites and 
degradates, including its metabolite 
CGA–322704. CGA–322704 is also the 
registered active ingredient 
clothianidin, for which tolerances are 
listed in 40 CFR 180.586. Clothianidin 
(hereinafter referred to as CGA–322704) 
has a complete toxicological database 
and appears to have effects in mammals 
that are different from those of 
thiamethoxam. A separate risk 
assessment that addresses risks from 
CGA–322704 residues resulting from the 
direct application of CGA–322704 
(clothianidin), as well as risks from 
residues of CGA–322704 coming from 
thiamethoxam uses has been conducted, 
and there are no risk estimates of 
concern as a result of the proposed 
tolerance for thiamethoxam residues in 
or on black pepper. 
Specific information on the risk 
assessments conducted in support of 
this action, including on the studies 
received and the nature of the adverse 
effects caused by thiamethoxam and 
CGA–322704, can be found in the 
documents titled ‘‘Thiamethoxam. 
Human Health Risk Assessment for Use 
on Imported Black Pepper’’ (hereinafter 
‘‘Thiamethoxam Human Health Risk 
Assessment’’) and ‘‘Clothianidin. 
Human Health Risk Assessment to 
Address Exposure Associated with a 
New Tolerance for Thiamethoxam in/on 
Imported Black Pepper’’ (hereinafter 
‘‘Clothianidin Human Health Risk 
Assessment’’), which are available in 
the docket for this action. 
B. Toxicological Profile 
For a discussion of the toxicological 
profile of thiamethoxam, see Unit III.A. 
of the thiamethoxam tolerance 
rulemaking published in the Federal 
Register of February 15, 2017 (82 FR 10712) (FRL–9957–00).

Levels of Concern 
For a summary of the toxicological 
points of departure (PODs)/levels of 
concern for thiamethoxam used for 
human health risk assessment, see Unit 
III.B. of the February 15, 2017, 
rulemaking (82 FR 10712) (FRL–9957– 
00). 
D. Exposure Assessment 
Much of the exposure assessment 
remains the same although updates have 
occurred to account for exposures from 
the petitioned-for tolerance. These 
updates are discussed in this section; for 
a description of the rest of the EPA 
approach to and assumptions for the 
exposure assessment, see Unit III.C. of 
the February 15, 2017, rulemaking (82 
FR 10712) (FRL–9957–00). 
1. Dietary exposure from food and feed uses. In evaluating dietary 
exposure to thiamethoxam, EPA 
considered exposure under the 
petitioned-for tolerance as well as all 
existing thiamethoxam tolerances in 40 
CFR 180.565. The assessments were 
conducted using the Dietary Exposure 
Evaluation Model software with the 
Food Commodity Intake Database 
(DEEM–FCID) Version 4.02. EPA used 
2005–2010 food consumption 
information from the United States 
Department of Agriculture’s National 
Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey, What We Eat in America. EPA 
assessed dietary exposures from 
thiamethoxam in food as follows: 
i. Acute exposure. The acute assessment is based on tolerance-level 
residues and assumes 100 percent crop 
treated (PCT); the acute assessment is 
unrefined. 
ii. Chronic exposure. The chronic assessment is based on average residues 
from crop field trials and assumes 100 
PCT; the chronic assessment is 
moderately refined. 
iii. Cancer. EPA has concluded that thiamethoxam is not likely to be 
carcinogenic to humans. Therefore, a 
dietary exposure assessment for the 
purpose of assessing cancer risk is 
unnecessary. 
iv. Anticipated residue and PCT information. FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(E) authorizes EPA to use available data and 
information on the anticipated residue 
levels of pesticide residues in food and 
the actual levels of pesticide residues 
that have been measured in food. If EPA 
relies on such information, EPA must 
require pursuant to FFDCA section 
408(f)(1) that data be provided 5 years 
after the tolerance is established, 
modified, or left in effect, demonstrating 
that the levels in food are not above the 
levels anticipated. For the present 
action, EPA will issue such data call-ins 
as are required by FFDCA section 
408(b)(2)(E) and authorized under 
FFDCA section 408(f)(1). Data will be 
required to be submitted no later than 
5 years from the date of issuance of this 
tolerance. 
EPA did not use PCT information in 
the dietary exposure assessment for 
thiamethoxam. 100 PCT was assumed 
for all food commodities. 
2. Dietary exposure from drinking water. EPA has revised the thiamethoxam drinking water 
assessment since the February 15, 2017, 
rulemaking (82 FR 10712) (FRL–9957– 
00). Based on the Pesticide in Water 
Calculator’s version 1.52, the estimated 
drinking water concentrations (EDWCs) 
of thiamethoxam in groundwater are 63 
parts per billion (ppb) for acute 
exposures and 58 ppm for chronic 
exposures. Groundwater EDWCs were 
used in the dietary assessment for all 
sources of drinking water. Further 
information regarding EPA drinking 
water models used in pesticide 
exposure assessment can be found at 
https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-science- 
and-assessing-pesticide-risks/models- 
pesticide-risk-assessment. 
3. From non-dietary exposure. The term ‘‘residential exposure’’ is used in 
this document to refer to non- 
occupational, non-dietary exposure 
(e.g., from lawn and garden pest control, indoor pest control, termiticides, and 
flea and tick control on pets). There are 
no new proposed residential uses for 
thiamethoxam at this time. However, 
thiamethoxam is currently registered for 
the following uses that could result in 
residential handler and post-application 
short-term dermal, inhalation, and 
incidental oral exposures: turf 
(including residential lawns and golf 
courses), gardens and trees, and indoor 
environments (as a crack and crevice 
treament). Worst-case residential 
exposure scenarios for adults and 
children were included in the aggregate 
risk estimates and were associated with 
post-application exposures from treated 
gardens, golf courses, and indoor 
spraying on carpets. 
4. Cumulative effects from substances with a common mechanism of toxicity. 
Section 408(b)(2)(D)(v) of FFDCA 
requires that, when considering whether 
to establish, modify, or revoke a 
tolerance, the Agency consider 
‘‘available information’’ concerning the 
cumulative effects of a particular 
pesticide’s residues and ‘‘other 
substances that have a common 
mechanism of toxicity.’’ In 2016, EPA’s 
Office of Pesticide Programs released a 
guidance document entitled ‘‘Pesticide 
Cumulative Risk Assessment: 
Framework for Screening Analysis.’’ The 
Agency has utilized this framework for 
thiamethoxam and determined that 
thiamethoxam along with clothianidin, 
acetamiprid, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, 
nithiazine, and thiacloprid form a 
candidate common mechanism group 
(CMG). This group of pesticides, 
referred to as neonicotinoids, is 
considered a candidate CMG because 
they share characteristics to support a 
testable hypothesis for a common 
mechanism of action for neonicotinoids. 
Following this determination, the 
Agency conducted an initial and 
updated screening-level cumulative risk 
assessment consistent with the 2016 
guidance document, which indicated 
that cumulative risk estimates for 
neonicotinoids are below the Agency’s 
levels of concern. The Agency has 
determined that exposures from the 
petitioned-for tolerance are not 
anticipated to affect the overall results 
of the previous cumulative assessment. 
Therefore, there are no cumulative risks 
of concern, and the neonicotinoid 
cumulative assessment does not need to 
be updated for this action. 
E. Safety Factor for Infants and Children 
EPA continues to conclude that there 
are reliable data to support the 
reduction of the 10X Food Quality 
Protection Act (FQPA) safety factor to 
1X. See Unit III.D. of the February 15, 
2017, rulemaking (82 FR 10712) (FRL– 
9957–00) for a discussion of the 
Agency’s rationale for that 
determination. 
F. Aggregate Risks and Determination of 
Safety 
EPA determines whether acute and 
chronic dietary pesticide exposures are 
safe by comparing aggregate exposure 
estimates to the acute population 
adjusted dose (aPAD) and chronic 
population adjusted dose (cPAD). For 
linear cancer risks, EPA calculates the 
lifetime probability of acquiring cancer 
given the estimated aggregate exposure. 
Short-, intermediate-, and chronic-term 
risks are evaluated by comparing the 
estimated aggregate food, water, and 
residential exposure to the appropriate 
PODs to ensure that an adequate margin 
of exposure (MOE) exists. Where 
different routes of exposure have 
different levels of concern, the Agency 
uses the aggregate risk index approach 
for calculating short-, intermediate-, and 
long-term aggregate risk estimates. 
1. Acute dietary risk. The acute dietary risk estimates for thiamethoxam 
are not of concern. Using the exposure 
assumptions discussed in this unit for 
acute exposure, EPA has concluded that 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  15:45 Dec 18, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\19DER1.SGM 19DER1
lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with RULES159396 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Rules and Regulations acute exposure to thiamethoxam from 
food and water is 13% of the aPAD for 
all infants (less than 1 year old), the 
population group receiving the greatest 
exposure. 
2. Chronic dietary risk. The chronic dietary risk estimates for thiamethoxam 
are not of concern. Using the exposure 
assumptions described in this unit for 
chronic exposure, EPA has concluded 
that chronic exposure to thiamethoxam 
from food and water is 75% of the cPAD 
for children 1–2 years old, the 
population group receiving the greatest 
exposure. 
3. Short-term risk. Short-term aggregate exposure takes into account 
short-term residential exposure plus 
chronic exposure to food and water 
(considered to be a background 
exposure level). Thiamethoxam is 
currently registered for uses that could 
result in short-term residential 
exposure, and the Agency has 
determined that it is appropriate to 
aggregate chronic exposure through food 
and water with short-term residential 
exposures to thiamethoxam. Using the 
exposure assumptions described in this 
unit for short-term exposures, the MOEs 
for children (490 and 160) and adults 
(120) are greater than their respective 
LOCs of 100. As a result, the short-term 
aggregate risk estimates are not of 
concern for the general U.S. population 
or any population subgroup. 
4. Intermediate- and long-term risk. Intermediate- and long-term aggregate 
exposure takes into account 
intermediate-term residential exposure 
plus chronic exposure to food and water 
(considered to be a background 
exposure level). For thiamethoxam, 
residential exposures are not expected 
to occur for intermediate-term duration 
(1–6 months); therefore, intermediate- 
and long-term risk were not assessed. 
5. Aggregate cancer risk for U.S. population. Thiamethoxam is classified as ‘‘Not likely to be carcinogenic to 
humans’’; therefore, EPA does not 
expect thiamethoxam exposures to pose 
an aggregate cancer risk. 
6. Determination of safety. Based on the risk assessments and information 
described above, EPA concludes that 
there is a reasonable certainty that no 
harm will result to the general 
population, or to infants and children, 
from aggregate exposure to 
thiamethoxam residues. More detailed 
information on this action can be found 
in the Thimethoxam Human Health Risk 
Assessment and the Clothianidin 
Human Health Risk Assessment, which 
are available in the docket for this 
action. 
IV. Other Considerations 
A. Analytical Enforcement Methodology 
An adequate method, HPLC Method 
AG–675, is available to enforce the 
recommended tolerance. The method 
may be requested from: Chief, 
Analytical Chemistry Branch, 
Environmental Science Center, 701 
Mapes Rd., Ft. Meade, MD 20755–5350; 
telephone number: (410) 305–2905; 
email address: residuemethods@
epa.gov. 
B. International Residue Limits 
In making its tolerance decisions, EPA 
seeks to harmonize U.S. tolerances with 
international standards whenever 
possible, consistent with U.S. food 
safety standards and agricultural 
practices. EPA considers the 
international maximum residue limits 
(MRLs) established by the Codex 
Alimentarius Commission (Codex), as 
required by FFDCA section 408(b)(4). 
The Codex Alimentarius is a joint 
United Nations Food and Agriculture 
Organization/World Health 
Organization food standards program, 
and it is recognized as an international 
food safety standards-setting 
organization in trade agreements to 
which the U.S. is a party. EPA may 
establish a tolerance that is different 
from a Codex MRL; however, FFDCA 
section 408(b)(4) requires that EPA 
explain the reasons for departing from 
the Codex level. 
Neither Codex nor Canada’s Pest 
Management Regulatory Agency have 
established a MRL for thiamethoxam in 
or on black pepper. Therefore, there are 
no harmonization issues regarding the 
establishment of a tolerance without a 
U.S. registration on black pepper. 
C. Effective and Expiration Date(s) 
In general, a tolerance action is 
effective on the date of publication of 
the final rule in the Federal Register. 
For actions in the final rule that lower 
or revoke existing tolerances, EPA will 
set an expiration date for the existing 
tolerance of six months after the date of 
publication of the final rule in the 
Federal Register, in order to allow a 
reasonable interval for producers in 
exporting members of the World Trade 
Organization’s Sanitary and 
Phytosanitary Measures Agreement to 
adapt to the requirements. 
V. Conclusion 
Therefore, a tolerance is established 
for residues of thiamethoxam, in or on 
pepper, black at 0.15 ppm. 
VI. Statutory and Executive Order 
Reviews 
Additional information about these 
statutes and executive orders can be 
found at https://www.epa.gov/laws- 
regulations/laws-and-executive-orders. 
A. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory 
Planning and Review 
This action is exempt from review 
under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 
51735, October 4, 1993), because it 
establishes or modifies a pesticide 
tolerance or a tolerance exemption 
under FFDCA section 408 in response to 
a petition submitted to the Agency. The 
Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) has exempted these types of 
actions from review under Executive 
Order 12866. 
B. Executive Order 14192: Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation 
Executive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, 
February 6, 2025) does not apply 
because actions that establish a 
tolerance under FFDCA section 408 are 
exempted from review under Executive 
Order 12866. 
C. Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) 
This action does not impose an 
information collection burden under the 
PRA 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., because it 
does not contain any information 
collection activities. 
D. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
Since tolerance actions that are 
established on the basis of a petition 
under FFDCA section 408(d), such as 
the tolerance in this final rule, do not 
require the issuance of a proposed rule, 
the requirements of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 
601 et seq., do not apply to this action. E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
(UMRA) 
This action does not contain an 
unfunded mandate of $100 million or 
more (in 1995 dollars and adjusted 
annually for inflation) as described in 
UMRA, 2 U.S.C. 1531–1538, and does 
not significantly or uniquely affect small 
governments. The action imposes no 
enforceable duty on any state, local or 
tribal governments or on the private 
sector. 
F. Executive Order 13132: Federalism 
This action does not have federalism 
implications as specified in Executive 
Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 
1999), because it will not have 
substantial direct effects on the states, 
on the relationship between the national 
government and the states, or on the 
distribution of power and

G. Executive Order 13175: Consultation 
and Coordination With Indian Tribal 
Governments 
This action does not have Tribal 
implications as specified in Executive 
Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 
2000), because it will not have 
substantial direct effects on Tribal 
governments, on the relationship 
between the federal government and the 
Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of 
power and responsibilities between the 
federal government and Indian Tribes. 
H. Executive Order 13045: Protection of 
Children From Environmental Health 
Risks and Safety Risks 
This action is not subject to Executive 
Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 
1997) because tolerance actions like this 
one are exempt from review under 
Executive Order 12866. However, EPA’s 
2021 Policy on Children’s Health applies to this action. This rule finalizes 
a tolerance action under the FFDCA, 
which requires EPA to give special 
consideration to exposure of infants and 
children to the pesticide chemical 
residue in establishing a tolerance and 
to ‘‘ensure that there is a reasonable 
certainty that no harm will result to 
infants and children from aggregate 
exposure to the pesticide chemical 
residue . . .’’ (FFDCA 408(b)(2)(C)). The 
Agency’s consideration is summarized 
in Unit III.D. 
I. Executive Order 13211: Actions 
Concerning Regulations That 
Significantly Affect Energy Supply, 
Distribution or Use 
This action is not subject to Executive 
Order 13211 (66 FR 28355) (May 22, 
2001) because it is not a significant 
regulatory action under Executive Order 
12866. 
J. National Technology Transfer 
Advancement Act (NTTAA) 
This action does not involve technical 
standards that would require Agency 
consideration under NTTAA section 
12(d), 15 U.S.C. 272. 
K. Congressional Review Act (CRA) 
This action is subject to the CRA, 5 
U.S.C. 801 et seq., and EPA will submit 
a rule report to each House of the 
Congress and to the Comptroller General 
of the United States. This action is not 
a ‘‘major rule’’ as defined by 5 U.S.C. 
804(2).

COVID–19 Mitigation Policy 
Requirement in Head Start Programs; 
Recission 
AGENCY: Office of Head Start (OHS), Administration for Children and 
Families (ACF), Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS). 
ACTION: Direct final rule; request for comments. 
SUMMARY: This direct final rule (DFR) removes the requirement that Head Start 
programs have a COVID–19 mitigation 
policy. This requirement was included 
in the final rule titled ‘‘Mitigating the 
Spread of COVID–19 in Head Start 
Programs,’’ which ACF published on 
January 6, 2023. Specifically, this 
rescission removes the requirement 
from the Head Start Program 
Performance Standards (Performance 
Standards) that Head Start programs 
have a COVID–19 mitigation policy 
developed in consultation with their 
Health and Mental Health Services 
Advisory Committee (HMHSAC), 
formerly the Health Services Advisory 
Committee (HSAC). This DFR meets the 
deregulatory requirements of Executive 
Order 14192, Unleashing Prosperity 
Through Deregulation, and is aligned 
with Executive Order 14148, Initial 
Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders 
and Actions. 
DATES: This DFR is effective on February 17, 2026 unless significant 
adverse comments are received by 
January 20, 2026. If significant adverse 
comments are received, notice will be 
published in the Federal Register before 
the effective date either withdrawing the 
rule or issuing a new final rule that 
responds to significant adverse 
comments. 
ADDRESSES: You may submit comments, identified by [docket number and/or 
RIN number] by any of the following 
methods: 
€Federal eRulemaking Portal: http:// www.regulations.gov. Follow the instructions for submitting comments.

I. Background 
Since its inception in 1965, Head 
Start has been a leader in supporting 
children from low-income families to 
enter kindergarten healthy, prepared, 
and ready to thrive in school and life. 
Decades of evidence continue to affirm 
the positive outcomes for children and 
families who participate in and graduate 
from Head Start programs.
1
The 
program was founded on research 
demonstrating that health and well- 
being are essential prerequisites for 
optimal learning and improved short- 
and long-term outcomes. OHS 
recognizes health as the cornerstone of 
school readiness, underscoring its 
critical role in the program’s mission. 
To ensure the safety and well-being of 
all children, families, and staff, the 
Head Start program prioritizes creating 
environments that are safe and 
conducive to learning. Section 1302.47 
of the Performance Standards 
establishes comprehensive health and 
safety requirements for Head Start 
programs (45 CFR 1302.47). This section 
sets forth expectations for programs to 
implement policies and practices that 
safeguard children during program 
hours and maintain facilities and 
equipment in safe and sanitary 
conditions. Importantly, the 
requirements within § 1302.47 are 
designed with flexibility, enabling 
programs to address a wide range of 
health and safety considerations— 
including communicable disease 
prevention—tailored to their 
community’s specific needs. 
In response to the Biden 
Administration’s COVID–19 Action 
Plan, ‘‘Path out of the Pandemic,’’ ACF 
published an interim final rule with 
comment period (IFC), Vaccine and 
Mask Requirements to Mitigate the 
Spread of COVID–19 in Head Start 
Programs, on November 30, 2021.2
The 
IFC required (1) universal masking for 
individuals 2 years of age and older, 
subject to some exceptions; and (2) 
vaccination by January 31, 2022 for 
Head Start staff, contractors whose 
activities involve contact with or 
providing direct services to children 
and families, and volunteers working in 
classrooms or directly with children. 
Soon after the publication of the IFC, 
several court decisions placed a 
preliminary injunction on the IFC, 
meaning Head Start grant recipients in 
those states were not required to comply 
with the requirements in the IFC. 
Specifically, on December 31, 2021, the 
court placed a preliminary injunction 
on the IFC in Texas, and on January 1, 
2022, the court placed a preliminary 
injunction on 24 other states.
3
On 
January 6, 2023, ACF published a final 
rule in the Federal Register removing 
the universal masking requirement, and 
instead requiring Head Start programs to 
adopt an evidence-based COVID–19 
mitigation policy, developed in 
consultation with their HMHSAC, 
formerly Health Services Advisory 
Committee (HSAC). On March 31, 2023, 
the court vacated the IFC, which took 
effect April 7, 2023, removing the 
requirement for vaccination and 
testing.
4
 
On April 10, 2023, President Biden 
signed legislation ending the COVID–19 
national emergency declared under the 
National Emergencies Act.
5
 
Subsequently, on May 11, 2023, the 
COVID–19 public health emergency 
expired. In response to the court 
vacating the IFC and the end to the 
public health emergency, on June 26, 
2023, ACF issued a final rule to remove 
the vaccine and testing requirements, 
rescinding those requirements from the 
IFC issued on November 30, 2021, and 
removing them from the Performance 
Standards.
6
 
II. Statutory Authority To Issue DFR 
We publish this direct final rule (DFR) 
under the authority granted to the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services 
by sections 641A of the Act (42 U.S.C. 
9836a), as amended by the Improving 
Head Start for School Readiness Act of 
2007 (Public Law 110–134). Under these 
sections, the Secretary is required to 
establish performance standards and 
other regulations for Head Start and 
Early Head Start programs. Specifically, 
sections 641A(a)(1) and (2) of the Act 
requires the Secretary to ‘‘modify, as 
necessary, program performance 
standards by regulation applicable to 
Head Start agencies and programs.’’
7
 
This rule meets the statutory 
requirements Congress put forth in its 
2007 bipartisan reauthorization of the 
Head Start program and addresses 
Congress’s mandate that called for the 
Secretary to review and revise the 
Performance Standards.
8
The Secretary 
has determined that the removal of this 
requirement in the Performance 
Standards contained in this regulation is 
necessary, given there is no longer a 
COVID–19 pandemic, and the 
associated Public Health Emergency 
ended. 
III. Discussion of Change 
Rescinding the Requirement for a 
COVID–19 Mitigation Policy 
(§ 1302.47(b)(9)) 
Section 1302.47 establishes 
expectations for Head Start programs to 
ensure basic health and safety measures 
are taken for the protection of all 
children. We propose to remove 
§ 1302.47(b)(9), which requires 
programs specifically to have an 
evidence-based COVID–19 mitigation 
policy developed in consultation with 
their HMHSAC, formerly HSAC. 
ACF’s proposal to rescind these 
requirements is informed by three key 
factors: (1) the termination of the 
national emergency concerning COVID– 
19 on April 10, 2023, following the 
enactment of Public Law 118–3, and the 
subsequent expiration of the COVID–19 
Public Health Emergency on May 11, 
2023, as declared by the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services under the 
Public Health Service Act;
9
(2) the 
determination that this requirement is 
duplicative of existing safety practice 
provisions outlined in 
§ 1302.47(b)(7)(iii); and (3) alignment 
with the Administration’s policies, as 
articulated in Executive Order 14148. 
First, the termination of the national 
emergency concerning COVID–19 and 
expiration of the COVID–19 Public 
Health Emergency reflect a significant

shift in the federal government’s 
approach to managing the pandemic, 
signaling that the acute phase of the 
public health crisis has passed. Since 
January 2021, the United States has seen 
a sustained and substantial decline in 
COVID–19 transmission and severe 
outcomes.
10
We are no longer in a 
pandemic. With these emergency 
declarations no longer in effect, there is 
no reason to require specific COVID–19 
mitigation requirements of Head Start 
grant recipients. 
Second, § 1302.47(b)(7)(iii) of the 
Performance Standards requires 
programs to establish, follow, and 
practice procedures for ‘‘protection from 
contagious disease, including 
appropriate inclusion and exclusion 
policies for when a child is ill, and from 
an infectious disease outbreak, 
including appropriate notifications of 
any reportable illness.’’ This provision 
establishes the longstanding and 
comprehensive expectation that Head 
Start programs implement policies and 
procedures to prevent and control the 
spread of communicable diseases. These 
procedures are intended to be evidence- 
based, responsive to public health 
guidance, and adaptable to the specific 
conditions within a program and its 
community. 
With the expiration of the COVID–19 
public health emergency and the 
significant reduction in COVID–19- 
related risks, this standalone 
requirement has become duplicative of 
the broader health and safety provisions 
already required under 
§ 1302.47(b)(7)(iii). Programs continue 
to be responsible for developing and 
implementing communicable disease 
policies, including measures to address 
COVID–19, when necessary, but the 
specific regulatory requirement is no 
longer needed to achieve that objective. 
Moreover, the requirement in 
§ 1302.47(b)(7)(iii) provides programs 
with the necessary flexibility to tailor 
communicable disease policies to their 
unique circumstances, taking into 
account current public health 
conditions, local health department 
guidance, and the needs of their 
enrolled children and families. 
Retaining a COVID–19-specific 
mitigation policy requirement in 
regulation is therefore redundant. 
Maintaining the separate regulatory 
requirement may also create confusion 
or suggest a regulatory distinction 
between COVID–19 and other 
communicable diseases that no longer 
reflects current public health guidance. 
The removal of § 1302.47(b)(9) aligns 
the standards with ACF’s efforts to 
provide flexibility and reduces 
unnecessary regulatory burden on 
programs while maintaining critical 
protections for child health and safety. 
Third, the rescission of this 
requirement aligns with the 
Administration’s policies, as articulated 
in Executive Order 14148. Specifically, 
the proposal to remove this requirement 
specific to COVID–19 is consistent with 
the revocation of Executive Order 
13987, Organizing and Mobilizing the 
United States Government to Combat 
COVID–19 and To Provide United States 
Leadership on Global Health and 
Security, issued on January 20, 2021. 
Waiver of Notice and Comment Process 
When engaging in rulemaking, HHS 
will ordinarily publish a notice of 
proposed rulemaking in the Federal 
Register to provide a period for public comment before the provisions of a rule 
take effect in accordance with the 
Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 
U.S.C. 553(b).
11
Under the APA,
12
an 
agency is not required to provide notice 
and public comment prior to issuing a 
direct final rule when it determines, for 
good cause, that such procedures are 
impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary 
to the public interest. In such instances, 
the agency must include in the rule a 
statement of its findings and the reasons 
supporting its determination that the 
notice and public comment procedure 
generally required under the APA are 
impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary 
to the public interest. 
At this point in time, when the 
pandemic is over, ACF finds that it is 
unnecessary to provide a public 
comment period before issuing this 
DFR. Courts have found ‘‘good cause’’ 
that notice and comment is unnecessary 
when changes are considered ‘‘a routine 
determination, insignificant in nature 
and impact, and inconsequential to the 
industry and to the public.’’ Mack 
Trucks, Inc. v. EPA, 682 F.3d 87, 94 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting Utility Solid 
Waste Activities Grp. v. EPA, 236 F.3d 749, 755 (D.C. Cir. 2001)); accord Nat. 
Res. Def. Council v. Nat’l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 894 F.3d 95, 114 
(2d Cir. 2018); N.C. Growers’ Ass’n, Inc. 
v. United Farm Workers, 702 F.3d 755, 766–67 (4th Cir. 2012); see Attorney 
General’s APA MANUAL 31 
(‘‘ ‘Unnecessary’ refers to the issuance of 
a minor rule in which the public is not 
particularly interested.’’); APA 
LEGISLATIVE HISTORY 200 
(‘‘ ‘Unnecessary’ means unnecessary so 
far as the public is concerned, as would 
be the case if a minor or merely 
technical amendment in which the 
public is not particularly interested 
were involved.’’). 
The rescission of the requirement to 
have an evidence-based COVID–19 
mitigation plan is a minor rule change 
that is not of interest to the public to 
provide comment on because the 
COVID–19 pandemic is no longer a 
public health emergency and because 
the Performance Standards already have 
broad health and safety provisions in 
effect under § 1302.47(b)(7)(iii) that 
relate to implementing communicable 
disease policies. Duplicating other 
requirements in the Performance 
Standards creates additional regulatory 
burden for Head Start programs,and 
rescinding the outdated requirement 
specific to COVID–19 poses no harm or 
burden to programs or the public. 
Compliance With Sec 641A(a)(2) of the 
Act 
ACF will consider comments on the 
changes in this DFR from the public, 
including experts in the fields of child 
development, early childhood 
education, child health care, family 
services, administration, and financial 
management, and from persons with 
experience in the operation of Head 
Start programs. We also welcome 
feedback from Indian Tribes. Note that 
a DFR will become permanent unless 
we receive adverse comments on this 
proposed rescission that requires us to 
withdraw the DFR, but, regardless, OHS 
values input from programs regarding 
service delivery. 
IV. Regulatory Process Matters 
We have examined the impacts of the 
direct final rule under Executive Order 
12866, Executive Order 13563, 
Executive Order 14192, the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601–612), the 
Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801, 
Pub. L. 104–121), and the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 
104–4). 
Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 
direct us to assess all benefits and costs 
of available regulatory alternatives and, 
when regulation is necessary, to select 
regulatory approaches that maximize 
net benefits. This rule was determined 
to be significant under Section 3(f) of 
Executive Order 12866 and is subject to 
review by the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB). Executive Order 14192 
requires that any new incremental costs 
associated with significant new 
regulations ‘‘shall, to the extent 
permitted by law, be offset by the 
elimination of existing costs associated

Preschool and Daycare (11–9031) of $27.05 doubled 
to account for costs associated with labor other than 
wages. 
with at least ten prior regulations.’’ Our 
analysis indicates, and the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs 
(OIRA) has determined, that this direct 
final rule does not meet the criteria set 
forth in 5 U.S.C. 804(2) under the 
Congressional Review Act. 
This direct final rule is considered an 
E.O. 14192 deregulatory action. We 
estimate that this action will generate 
about $17,312 in savings per year. This 
estimate is consistent with the planned 
discontinuation of an OMB-approved 
information collection with control 
number 0970–0148, associated with the 
recordkeeping requirement of updating 
program policies and procedures. We 
pair the existing 320-hour annual time- 
burden estimate with a fully loaded 
wage rate of $54.10 based on the median 
wage of Education and Childcare 
Administrators, Preschool and 
Daycare.
13
The present value of these 
cost savings is $0.23 million, or $0.02 
million in annualized terms, reported in 
constant 2024 dollars at a 7 percent 
discount rate, discounted relative to 
year 2024, over a perpetual time 
horizon. 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
requires agencies to consider the impact 
of their regulatory proposals on small 
entities. The impacts to small entities 
attributable to the final rule are cost 
savings from eliminating a 
recordkeeping requirement. We certify 
that the direct final rule will not have 
a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
of 1995 (UMRA) generally requires that 
each agency conduct a cost-benefit 
analysis; identify and consider a 
reasonable number of regulatory 
alternatives; and select the least costly, 
most cost-effective, or least burdensome 
alternative that achieves the objectives 
of the rule before promulgating any 
proposed or final rule that includes a 
Federal mandate that may result in 
expenditures of more than $100 million 
(adjusted for inflation) in at least one 
year by State, local, and tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector. Each agency issuing a 
rule with relevant effects over that 
threshold must also seek input from 
State, local, and tribal governments. The 
current threshold after adjustment for 
inflation is $187 million, using the most 
current (2024) Implicit Price Deflator for 
the Gross Domestic Product. This direct 
final rule will not result in an unfunded 
mandate that exceeds this monetary 
threshold in any year. 
Federalism Assessment Executive Order 
13132 
Executive Order 13132 requires 
federal agencies to consult with State 
and local government officials if they 
develop regulatory policies with 
federalism implications. Federalism is 
rooted in the belief that issues that are 
not national in scope or significance are 
most appropriately addressed by the 
level of government close to the people. 
This rule would not have substantial 
direct impact on the states, on the 
relationship between the federal 
government and the states, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 6 of Executive 
Order 13132, it is determined that this 
action does not have sufficient 
federalism implications to warrant the 
preparation of a federalism summary 
impact statement. 
Treasury and General Government 
Appropriations Act of 1999 
Section 654 of the Treasury and 
General Government Appropriations 
Act of 1999 requires federal agencies to 
determine whether a policy or 
regulation may negatively affect family 
well-being. If the agency determines a 
policy or regulation negatively affects 
family well-being, then the agency must 
prepare an impact assessment 
addressing seven criteria specified in 
the law. ACF believes it is not necessary 
to prepare a family policymaking 
assessment (see Pub. L. 105–277) 
because the action it takes in this rule 
would not have any impact on the 
autonomy or integrity of the family as 
an institution. 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) 
of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., 
minimizes government-imposed burden 
on the public. In keeping with the 
notion that government information is a 
valuable asset, it also is intended to 
improve the practical utility, quality, 
and clarity of information collected, 
maintained, and disclosed. 
The PRA requires that agencies obtain 
OMB approval, which includes issuing 
an OMB number and expiration date, 
before requesting most types of 
information from the public. 
Regulations at 5 CFR part 1320 
implemented the provisions of the PRA 
and § 1320.3 defines a ‘‘collection of 
information,’’ ‘‘information,’’ and 
‘‘burden.’’ PRA defines ‘‘information’’ as 
any statement or estimate of fact or 
opinion, regardless of form or format, 
whether numerical, graphic, or narrative 
form, and whether oral or maintained 
on paper, electronic, or other media (5 
CFR 1320.3(h)). This includes requests 
for information to be sent to the 
Government, such as forms, written 
reports and surveys, recordkeeping 
requirements, and third-party or public 
disclosures (5 CFR 1320.3(c)). ‘‘Burden’’ 
means the total time, effort, or financial 
resources expended by persons to 
collect, maintain, or disclose 
information. 
When this requirement was first 
established, OHS modified the OMB- 
approved information collection with 
control number 0970–0148, associated 
with the recordkeeping requirement of 
updating program policies and 
procedures. At that time, OHS assumed 
320 burden hours and this was 
approved as part of modifications to 
OMB 0970–0148. With the publication 
of this rule, OHS will remove the 
estimated burden from OMB 0970–0148 
upon renewal.

Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard 
(Std) 603–2018, ‘‘IEEE Standard Criteria 
for Safety Systems for Nuclear Power 
Generating Stations.’’ The IEEE Std 603– 
2018 is the most recent version of IEEE 
Std 603 that addresses the power, 
instrumentation, and control safety 
systems for nuclear power reactors. This 
amendment also incorporates editorial 
changes that do not change the technical 
information. The NRC plans to hold a 
public meeting to promote full 
understanding of the proposed rule and 
facilitate public comments. 
DATES: Submit comments by February 17, 2026. Comments received after this 
date will be considered if it is practical 
to do so, but the Commission is able to 
ensure consideration only for comments 
received before this date. 
ADDRESSES: You may submit comments by any of the following methods;

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rulemaking is separate from NRC’s 
comprehensive review and reform of its 
regulations in accordance with 
Executive Order (E.O.) 14300, ‘‘Ordering 
the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission’’ (90 FR 22587; May 29, 
2025). The rulemakings associated with 
that effort will comprehensively 
reexamine NRC requirements. While 
there could be additional revisions as a 
result of these future rulemakings, the 
NRC is moving forward with 
publication of this proposed rule at this 
time because it is an action of high 
interest for stakeholders that was in 
progress before the issuance of E.O. 
14300. 
Executive Summary 
A. Need for Regulatory Action 
The IEEE periodically revises and 
updates its codes for nuclear power 
plants by issuing new editions; this 
proposed rule is in accordance with the 
NRC’s practice to incorporate new 
editions into the NRC’s regulations. This 
proposed rule allows nuclear power 
plant applicants to take advantage of the 
latest IEEE Std, enhancing efficiency for 
applicants and the NRC without 
affecting safety. The NRC’s use of the 
IEEE Std is consistent with applicable 
requirements of the National 
Technology Transfer and Advancement 
Act (NTTAA). See also Section XII of 
this document, ‘‘Voluntary Consensus 
Standards.’’ 
B. Major Provision 
The primary effect of this proposed 
rule is the incorporation by reference of 
IEEE Std 603–2018 into title 10 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) 
50.55a, ‘‘Codes and standards,’’ and to 
provide for its use for nuclear power 
reactors of all types. This proposed rule 
also includes a conforming amendment 
to paragraph (b)(1)(v) of section 50.69, 
‘‘Risk-informed categorization and 
treatment of structures, systems and 
components for nuclear power 
reactors,’’ of 10 CFR, which would 
extend that provision to allow risk- 
informed alternatives to Clauses 5.3 and 
5.4 of IEEE 603–2018 for certain 
systems, structure, and components.

II. Background 
It has been the NRC’s practice to 
establish requirements for the protection 
systems and safety systems in nuclear 
power plants by incorporating by 
reference certain standards published by 
the IEEE into 10 CFR 50.55a, ‘‘Codes 
and standards.’’ 
Paragraph 50.55a(h)(2), ‘‘Protection 
systems,’’ currently requires that the 
protection systems in nuclear power 
plants with construction permits issued 
after January 1, 1971, but before May 13, 
1999, meet the requirements stated in 
either IEEE Std 279, ‘‘Criteria for 
Protection Systems for Nuclear Power 
Generating Stations,’’ or with the 
requirements in IEEE Std 603–1991, 
‘‘IEEE Criteria for Safety Systems for 
Nuclear Power Generating Stations,’’ 
including the correction sheet dated 
January 30, 1995. For nuclear power 
plants with construction permits issued 
before January 1, 1971, 10 CFR 
50.55a(h)(2) requires that protection 
systems must be consistent with their 
licensing basis or meet the requirements 
of IEEE Std 603–1991 including the 
correction sheet dated January 30, 1995. 
Paragraph 50.55a(h)(3), ‘‘Safety 
systems,’’ currently requires that 
applications filed on or after May 13, 
1999, for construction permits and 
operating licenses under 10 CFR part 50, 
as well as standard design approvals, 
standard design certifications, and 
combined licenses under 10 CFR part 
52, meet the requirements for safety 
systems stated in IEEE Std 603–1991 
including the correction sheet dated 
January 30, 1995. 
The IEEE superseded the previous 
standards with IEEE Std 603–2018. This 
proposed rule would update the NRC’s 
regulations to incorporate by reference 
and specify the requirements for using 
this latest version of IEEE Std 603 on the 
basis of license date, construction 
permit date, and type of protection 
system or safety system modification. 
This proposed rule would apply to (1) 
reactor design applications for a license, 
construction permit, design approval, or 
design certification, and (2) applications 
for license amendments for nuclear 
power plants. The NRC is proposing to 
make the final rule effective 30 days 
after its publication in the Federal 
Register. 
This proposed rule would incorporate 
voluntary consensus standard IEEE Std 
603–2018 into the NRC’s regulations to 
establish functional and design 
requirements for power, 
instrumentation, and control safety 
systems for nuclear power plants. This 
action would be consistent with the 
provisions of the NTTAA, which 
encourage Federal regulatory agencies to 
consider adopting voluntary consensus 
standards as an alternative to agency 
development of government-unique 
standards. 
The NRC staff held two public 
meetings on IEEE Std 2018 before this 
rulemaking was initiated: one on 
September 14, 2023, and one on 
September 19, 2024. The NRC 
appreciates the feedback received 
through these public meetings, which 
contributed to the development of this 
proposed rule. 
III. Discussion 
A. IEEE 603–2018 
The NRC proposes to update 10 CFR 
50.55a to incorporate by reference IEEE 
Std 603–2018. When applying IEEE Std 
603–2018, the first sentence within 
Clause 5.16, ‘‘Common-cause failure,’’ 
captures the only regulatory 
requirement of Clause 5.16, that the 
safety system design and development 
shall address common-cause failures 
(CCFs) that create a potential to degrade 
or defeat the safety system function. 
IEEE Std 603–2018 references several 
industry codes and standards that are 
not proposed for incorporation by 
reference in this rulemaking. These 
referenced standards are not mandatory 
NRC requirements, and if a referenced 
standard has been endorsed in a 
regulatory guide, the standard 
constitutes a method acceptable to the 
NRC for meeting a regulatory 
requirement. 
This proposed rule also includes a 
conforming amendment to paragraph 
(b)(1)(v) of 10 CFR 50.69, ‘‘Risk- 
informed categorization and treatment 
of structures, systems and components 
for nuclear power reactors,’’ which 
would extend that provision to allow 
risk-informed alternatives to Clauses 5.3

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with PROPOSALS159404 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Proposed Rules and 5.4 of IEEE 603–2018 for certain 
systems, structure, and components. 
B. Discussion of Clause 5.16 Regarding 
CCF and Existing Commission Policy 
IEEE Std 603–2018 includes Clause 
5.16, which provides criteria for 
evaluating the potential for safety 
system CCF. As this Clause 5.16 does 
not exist in IEEE Std 603–1991, it is not 
in the currently incorporated by 
reference version. In the 2018 version, 
Clause 5.16 applies to any source of 
vulnerability to CCF. 
The first sentence in Clause 5.16 
states that—the safety system design 
and development shall address CCFs 
that create a potential to degrade or 
defeat the safety system function. This 
statement is consistent with the NRC’s 
position on CCF, which is why it is 
proposed to be included as part of this 
proposed rule. The Commission’s policy 
on addressing CCF is found in Staff 
Requirements Memorandum (SRM)– 
SECY–22–0076, ‘‘Expansion of Current 
Policy on Potential Common-Cause 
Failures in Digital Instrumentation and 
Control Systems,’’ dated August 10, 
2022. As noted in the Commission’s 
policy, before a nuclear generating 
station safety system is considered 
ready for implementation at the facility, 
developers must demonstrate that 
vulnerabilities to CCF have been 
adequately identified and addressed. 
The NRC staff considers the 
remainder of Clause 5.16 of IEEE Std 
603–2018 as guidance on how CCF 
could be addressed. The methods 
included in Clause 5.16 may be 
acceptable for licensees or applicants to 
address CCF as part of their overall 
defense-in-depth and diversity (D3) 
analyses, in appropriate circumstances; 
however, the list is not comprehensive 
and does not include flexibilities the 
Commission recently directed the NRC 
staff to incorporate into its licensing 
reviews. In its direction to the NRC staff 
in SRM–SECY–22–0076, the 
Commission approved expanded 
acceptance of risk-informed approaches 
in performing the defense-in-depth and 
diversity assessment and in determining 
the adequacy of design techniques, 
prevention measures, and mitigation 
measures, other than diversity, to 
address a postulated digital 
instrumentation and controls CCF. This 
policy provides additional flexibility in 
addressing CCFs beyond the methods 
described in Clause 5.16. Therefore, 
licensees or applicants may use the 
methods described in Clause 5.16 and 
other methods referenced in Draft 
Regulatory Guide (DG) DG–1251, 
Revision 1, ‘‘Guidance for the Power, 
Instrumentation, and Control Portions of 
Safety Systems for Nuclear Power 
Plants,’’ in their overall D3 analyses. 
The NRC staff guidance for evaluation of 
defense in depth and diversity to 
address CCF is found in NUREG–0800, 
‘‘Standard Review Plan,’’ Chapter 7, 
Branch Technical Position 7–19 (BTP 7– 
19), Revision 9, ‘‘Guidance for 
Evaluation of Defense in Depth and 
Diversity to Address Common-Cause 
Failure Due to Latent Design Defects in 
Digital Instrumentation and Control 
Systems,’’ and the Design Review 
Guide, ‘‘Design Review Guide (DRG): 
Instrumentation and Controls for Non- 
Light-Water Reactor (Non-LWR) 
Reviews,’’ as applicable. Further, 
regarding the last paragraph in Clause 
5.16, the NRC staff agrees that if a 
determination concludes that the 
consequences of a CCF are low or a 
determination concludes that the CCF 
has a very low likelihood of occurrence, 
then that conclusion could be credited 
in a plant-specific analysis toward 
justification of the proposed safety 
system design in a risk-informed 
approach. However, a risk-informed 
approach requires that risk insights are 
considered together with other factors to 
establish requirements that better focus 
licensee and regulatory attention on 
design and operational issues 
commensurate with their importance to 
public health and safety, consistent with 
SRM–SECY–98–144, ‘‘Risk-informed 
and Performance Based Regulation,’’ 
and SRM–SECY–22–0076. Finally, the 
NRC staff agrees that each identified 
source of CCF should be evaluated on a 
case-by-case basis. 
Therefore, the NRC proposes to 
update 10 CFR 50.55a to incorporate by 
reference IEEE Std 603–2018. When 
applying IEEE Std 603–2018, the first 
sentence within Clause 5.16, ‘‘Common- 
cause failure,’’ captures the only 
regulatory requirement of Clause 5.16, 
that the safety system design and 
development shall address CCF that 
create a potential to degrade or defeat 
the safety system function. 
C. Protection Systems and Safety 
Systems 
The NRC’s understanding of 
‘‘protection systems’’ and ‘‘safety 
systems’’ as used in 10 CFR 50.55a(h) 
remains the same as described in the 
1999 rulemaking to incorporate IEEE 
Std 603–1991 by reference into 10 CFR 
50.55a (64 FR 17944; April 13, 1999). 
Currently, 10 CFR 50.55a(h) specifies 
that ‘‘protection systems’’ for plants 
with construction permits issued after 
January 1, 1971, but before May 13, 
1999, must meet the requirements in 
IEEE Std 279–1968, ‘‘Proposed IEEE 
Criteria for Nuclear Power Plant 
Protection Systems,’’ or the 
requirements in IEEE Std 279–1971, 
‘‘Criteria for Protection Systems for 
Nuclear Power Generating Stations,’’ or 
the requirements in IEEE Std 603–1991, 
‘‘Criteria for Safety Systems for Nuclear 
Power Generating Stations, and the 
correction sheet dated January 30, 1995. 
IEEE Std 279–1971 states that a 
‘‘protection system’’ encompasses all 
electric and mechanical devices and 
circuitry (from sensors to actuation 
device input terminals) involved in 
generating those signals associated with 
the protective function. These signals 
include those that actuate reactor trip 
and that, in the event of a serious 
reactor accident, actuate engineered 
safety features, such as containment 
isolation, core spray, safety injection, 
pressure reduction, and air cleaning. In 
turn, ‘‘protective function’’ is defined in 
IEEE Std 279–1971 as the sensing of one 
or more variables associated with a 
particular generating station condition, 
signal processing, and the initiation and 
completion of the protective action at 
values of the variables established in the 
design bases. 
IEEE Std 603–2018 uses the term 
‘‘safety systems’’ rather than ‘‘protection 
systems’’ to define its scope. A ‘‘safety 
system’’ is defined in IEEE Std 603– 
2018 as a system that is relied upon to 
remain functional during and following 
design basis events to assure one of the 
following: (a) The integrity of the reactor 
coolant pressure boundary, (b) the 
capability to shut down the reactor and 
maintain it in a safe shutdown 
condition, or (c) the capability to 
prevent or mitigate the consequences of 
accidents that could result in potential 
offsite exposures comparable to 
regulatory guidelines. A ‘‘safety 
function’’ is defined in IEEE Std 603– 
2018 as one of the processes or 
conditions (for example, emergency 
negative reactivity insertion, post- 
accident heat removal, emergency core 
cooling, post-accident radioactivity 
removal, and containment isolation) 
essential to maintain plant parameters 
within acceptable limits established for 
a design basis event. 
The NRC recognizes that ‘‘protection 
systems’’ are a subset of ‘‘safety 
systems.’’ Safety system is a broad-based 
and all-encompassing term, embracing 
the protection system in addition to 
other electrical systems. Thus, the term 
‘‘protection system’’ is not synonymous 
with the term ‘‘safety system.’’ This 
proposed rule would not change the 
scope of the systems covered in the final 
safety analysis report for currently 
operating nuclear power plants.

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with PROPOSALS159405 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Proposed Rules IV. Section-by-Section Analysis 
The following paragraphs describe the 
specific changes proposed by this 
rulemaking. 
Section 50.55a Codes and Standards 
This proposed rule would revise 
paragraphs (a) and paragraphs (h)(2) and 
(h)(3) to include the IEEE standard 603– 
2018 and revise introductory text to 
paragraph (h) to align for readability. 
Section 50.69 Risk-Informed 
Categorization and Treatment of 
Structures, Systems and Components for 
Nuclear Power Reactors 
This proposed rule would revise 
paragraph (b)(v) to extend that provision 
to allow risk-informed alternatives to 
Clauses 5.3 and 5.4 of IEEE 603–2018 
for certain systems, structure, and 
components. 
Appendix E to 10 CFR Part 50— 
Emergency Planning and Preparedness 
for Production and Utilization Facilities 
This proposed rule would correct the 
title, from ‘‘Protection Systems’’ to 
‘‘Protection and safety systems,’’ 
referenced in footnote 7 of appendix E 
to 10 CFR part 50. 
V. Regulatory Flexibility Certification 
As required by the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), 
the NRC certifies that this rule, if 
adopted, will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. This proposed 
rule affects only the licensing and 
operation of nuclear power plants. The 
companies that own these plants do not 
fall within the scope of the definition of 
‘‘small entities’’ set forth in the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act or the size 
standards established by the NRC (10 
CFR 2.810). 
VI. Regulatory Analysis 
The NRC has prepared a draft 
regulatory analysis on this proposed 
regulation. The analysis examines the 
costs and benefits of the alternatives 
considered by the NRC. The NRC 
requests public comment on the draft 
regulatory analysis. The regulatory 
analysis is available as indicated in the 
‘‘Availability of Documents’’ section of 
this document. Comments on the draft 
analysis may be submitted to the NRC 
as indicated under the 
ADDRESSES 
caption of this document. 
VII. Backfitting and Issue Finality 
The NRC’s Backfit Rule in 10 
CFR 50.109 states that the NRC shall 
require the backfitting of a facility only 
when it finds the action to be justified 
under specific standards stated in the 
rule. Section 50.109(a)(1) defines 
backfitting as the modification of or 
addition to systems, structures, 
components, or design of a facility; the 
design approval or manufacturing 
license for a facility; or the procedures 
or organization required to design, 
construct, or operate a facility. Any of 
these modifications or additions may 
result from a new or amended provision 
in the NRC’s rules or the imposition of 
a regulatory position interpreting the 
NRC’s rules that is either new or 
different from a previously applicable 
NRC position after issuance of the 
construction permit or the operating 
license or the design approval. 
This rulemaking proposes to 
incorporate by reference the IEEE 603– 
2018. This proposed rule would not 
change requirements for existing 
licensees or applicants. If existing 
licensees or applicants request changes 
to their power and instrumentation 
control systems, this proposed rule 
would allow them to voluntarily comply 
with IEEE Std 603–2018 instead of other 
existing requirements. The proposed 
rule would require applicants and 
holders of new construction permits, 
new operating licenses, new final design 
certifications, and new combined 
licenses to meet IEEE Std 603–2018 after 
the effective date of the rule. However, 
changes in requirements for new 
applicants or licensees do not constitute 
backfitting. Therefore, this proposed 
rule, if finalized, would not constitute 
‘‘backfitting’’ as defined in 10 CFR 
50.109(a)(1). 
VIII. Plain Writing 
The Plain Writing Act of 2010 (Pub. 
L. 111–274) requires Federal agencies to 
write documents in a clear, concise, and 
well-organized manner. The NRC has 
written this document to be consistent 
with the Plain Writing Act as well as the 
Presidential Memorandum, ‘‘Plain 
Language in Government Writing,’’ 
published June 10, 1998, (63 FR 31885). 
The NRC requests comment on this 
document with respect to the clarity and 
effectiveness of the language used. 
IX. Environmental Assessment and 
Proposed Finding of No Significant 
Environmental Impact 
The Commission has determined 
under the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the 
Commission’s regulations in subpart A 
of 10 CFR part 51, that this rule, if 
adopted, would not be a major Federal 
action significantly affecting the quality 
of the human environment, and 
therefore an environmental impact 
statement is not required. 
The proposed rule does not 
significantly increase the probability or 
consequences of accidents, no changes 
are being made in the types of effluents 
that may be released off-site, and there 
is no significant increase in public 
radiation exposure. This proposed rule 
does not involve non-radiological plant 
effluents and has no other 
environmental impact. Therefore, no 
significant non-radiological impacts are 
associated with this proposed action. 
The determination of this 
environmental assessment is that there 
will be no significant effect on the 
quality of the human environment from 
this action. Public stakeholders should 
note; however, that comments on any 
aspect of this environmental assessment 
may be submitted to the NRC as 
indicated under the 
ADDRESSEScaption. 
X. Paperwork Reduction Act 
This proposed rule does not contain 
any new or amended collections of 
information subject to the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
et seq.). Existing collections of

Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB), approval numbers 3150–0011,

to a collection of information unless the 
document requesting or requiring the 
collection displays a currently valid 
OMB control number. 
XI. Executive Orders 
The following are Executive orders 
that are related to this proposed rule: 
A. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory 
Planning and Review (as Amended by 
Executive Order 14215, Ensuring 
Accountability for All Agencies) 
This action is not a significant 
regulatory action and therefore was not 
submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) for review. 
B. Executive Order 14154: Unleashing 
American Energy 
The NRC has examined this proposed 
rule and has determined that it is 
consistent with the policies and 
directives outlined in E.O. 14154. 
C. Executive Order 14192: Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation 
This action is a regulatory action as 
defined by E.O. 14192. Details on the 
estimated costs of this proposed rule 
can be found in Section VI of this 
document, ‘‘Regulatory Analysis.’’

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with PROPOSALS159406 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Proposed Rules 1
State-recognized Indian Tribes are not within 
the scope of 10 CFR 2.351(c). However, for purposes 
of the NRC’s compliance with 1 CFR 51.5, 
‘‘interested parties,’’ includes a broad set of 
stakeholders, including State-recognized Indian 
Tribes. 
D. Executive Order 14270: Zero-Based 
Regulatory Budgeting To Unleash 
American Energy 
E.O. 14270, ‘‘Zero-Based Regulatory 
Budgeting to Unleash American 
Energy,’’ requires the NRC to insert a 
conditional sunset date into all new or 
amended NRC regulations provided the 
regulations are (1) promulgated under 
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended (AEA), the Energy 
Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended 
(ERA), or the Nuclear Waste Policy Act 
of 1982, as amended (NWPA); (2) not 
statutorily required; and (3) not part of 
the NRC’s permitting regime. The NRC 
determined that the regulatory changes 
proposed in this rule are part of the 
NRC’s regulatory permitting scheme 
authorized by the AEA. Therefore, the 
NRC views this rulemaking to be 
outside the scope of Executive Order 
14270 and did not insert conditional 
sunset dates for the regulatory changes 
in this proposed rule. 
XII. Voluntary Consensus Standards 
The National Technology Transfer 
and Advancement Act of 1995, Public 
Law 104–113, requires that Federal 
agencies use technical standards that are 
developed or adopted by voluntary 
consensus standards bodies unless 
using such a standard is inconsistent 
with applicable law or is otherwise 
impractical. In this proposed rule, the 
NRC would incorporate the following 
voluntary consensus standard: IEEE Std 
603–2018, Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers, September 27, 
2018. The NRC invites comment on the 
applicability and use of other standards. 
XIII. Incorporation by Reference— 
Reasonable Availability to Interested 
Parties 
The NRC proposes to incorporate by 
reference the IEEE Std 603–2018. When 
applying IEEE Std 603–2018, the first 
sentence within Clause 5.16, ‘‘Common- 
cause failure,’’ captures the only 
regulatory requirement of Clause 5.16, 
that the safety system design and 
development shall address CCFs that 
create a potential to degrade or defeat 
the safety system function. As described 
in the ‘‘Background’’ and ‘‘Discussion’’ 
sections of this document, the material 
contains standards for establishing the 
minimum functional and design criteria 
for the power, instrumentation, and 
control portions of safety systems for 
nuclear power generating stations. 
The NRC is required by law to obtain 
approval for incorporation by reference 
from the Office of the Federal Register 
(OFR). The OFR’s requirements for 
incorporation by reference are set forth 
in 1 CFR part 51. On November 7, 2014, 
the OFR adopted changes to its 
regulations governing incorporation by 
reference (79 FR 66267). The OFR 
regulations require an agency to include 
in a proposed rule a discussion of the 
ways that the material the agency 
proposes to incorporate by reference are 
reasonably available to interested 
parties or how it worked to make the 
material reasonably available to 
interested parties. The discussion in this 
section complies with the requirement 
for proposed rules as set forth in 1 CFR 
51.5(a)(1). 
The NRC considers ‘‘interested 
parties’’ to include all potential NRC 
stakeholders and not only the 
individuals and entities regulated or 
otherwise subject to the NRC’s 
regulatory oversight. These NRC 
stakeholders are not a homogenous 
group but vary with respect to the 
considerations for determining 
reasonable availability. Therefore, the 
NRC distinguishes between different 
classes of interested parties for the 
purposes of determining whether the 
material is ‘‘reasonably available.’’ The 
NRC considers the following to be 
classes of interested parties in NRC 
rulemakings with regard to the material 
to be incorporated by reference: 
€Individuals and small entities regulated or otherwise subject to the 
NRC’s regulatory oversight (this class 
also includes applicants and potential 
applicants for licenses and other NRC 
regulatory approvals) and who are 
subject to the material to be 
incorporated by reference by 
rulemaking. In this context, ‘‘small 
entities’’ has the same meaning as a 
‘‘small entity’’ under 10 CFR 2.810. 
€Large entities otherwise subject to the NRC’s regulatory oversight (this 
class also includes applicants and 
potential applicants for licenses and 
other NRC regulatory approvals) and 
who are subject to the material to be 
incorporated by reference by 
rulemaking. In this context, ‘‘large 
entities’’ are those that do not qualify as 
a ‘‘small entity’’ under 10 CFR 2.810. 
€Non-governmental organizations with institutional interests in the 
matters regulated by the NRC. 
€Other Federal agencies, States, local governmental bodies (within the 
meaning of 10 CFR 2.315(c)). 
€Federally-recognized and State- recognized
1
Indian Tribes. 
€Members of the public (i.e., individual, unaffiliated members of the 
public who are not regulated or 
otherwise subject to the NRC’s 
regulatory oversight) who may wish to 
gain access to the material that the NRC 
proposes to incorporate by reference by 
rulemaking in order to participate in the 
rulemaking process. 
The IEEE 603–2018 Standard may be 
viewed, by appointment, at the 
Technical Library, which is located at 
Two White Flint, 11545 Rockville Pike, 
Rockville, Maryland 20852. You may 
submit your request to the Technical 
Library via email at Library.Resource@
nrc.gov between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. eastern time, Monday through Friday, 
except Federal holidays. In addition, as 
described in Section XVI of this 
document, documents related to this 
proposed rule are available online in the 
NRC’s ADAMS Public Documents 
collection at https://www.nrc.gov/ 
reading-rm/adams.html. 
Interested parties may purchase a 
copy of the IEEE material at the IEEE 
Standards Association website, https://
standards.ieee.org/. The material also is accessible through a third-party 
subscription service such as Accuris 
IHS (15 Inverness Way East, Englewood, 
CO 80112; https://store.accuristech.
com/publishers/ieee). 
The material is available to all 
interested parties in multiple ways and 
in a manner consistent with their 
interest in this proposed rule. Therefore, 
the NRC concludes that the material the 
NRC proposes to incorporate by 
reference in this proposed rule is 
reasonably available to all interested 
parties. 
XIV. Availability of Guidance 
The NRC is issuing draft guidance in 
conjunction with this proposed rule. 
Draft Regulatory Guide (DG)DG–1251,

The revision and addition read as 
follows: 
§ 50.55a Codes and standards. 
* * * * * 
(v) IEEE standard 603–2018. (IEEE Std 
603–2018), ‘‘Standard Criteria for Safety 
Systems for Nuclear Power Generating 
Stations’’ (Approval date: September 27, 
2018), referenced in paragraphs (h)(2) 
and (h)(3) of this section. All other 
standards that are referenced in IEEE 
Std 603–2018 are not approved for 
incorporation by reference. 
* * * * * 
(h) Protection and safety systems. Protection and safety systems of nuclear 
power reactors of all types must meet 
the requirements specified in this 
paragraph. Each combined license for a 
utilization facility is subject to the 
following conditions. * * * 
(2) * * * 
(i) For nuclear power plants with 
construction permits issued after 
January 1, 1971, but before May 13, 
1999, protection systems must meet the 
requirements in IEEE Std 279–1968, 
‘‘Proposed IEEE Criteria for Nuclear 
Power Plant Protection Systems,’’ or the 
requirements in IEEE Std 279–1971,

When applying IEEE Std 603–2018, the 
first sentence within Clause 5.16, 
‘‘Common-cause failure,’’ captures the 
only regulatory requirement of Clause 
5.16, that the safety system design and 
development shall address common- 
cause failures (CCFs) that create a 
potential to degrade or defeat the safety 
system function. 
(ii) For nuclear power plants with 
construction permits issued before 
January 1, 1971, protection systems 
must be consistent with their licensing 
basis or may meet the requirements of 
IEEE Std 603–1991 and the correction 
sheet dated January 30, 1995, or the 
requirements in IEEE Std 603–2018, 
dated September 27, 2018. When 
applying IEEE Std 603–2018, Clause 
5.16, ‘‘Common-cause failure,’’ the first 
sentence within Clause 5.16, ‘‘Common- 
cause failure,’’ captures the only 
regulatory requirement of Clause 5.16, 
that the safety system design and 
development shall address CCFs that 
create a potential to degrade or defeat 
the safety system function. 
(3) Safety systems. 
(i) Applications filed on or after May 
13, 1999, but before [DATE 30 DAYS 
AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION OF

certifications, and combined licenses 
under part 52 of this chapter, must meet 
the requirements for safety systems in 
IEEE Std 603–1991 and the correction 
sheet dated January 30, 1995, or the 
requirements in IEEE Std 603–2018. 
When applying IEEE Std 603–2018, the 
first sentence within Clause 5.16, 
‘‘Common-cause failure,’’ captures the 
only regulatory requirement of Clause 
5.16, that the safety system design and 
development shall address CCFs that 
create a potential to degrade or defeat 
the safety system function. 
(ii) Applications filed on or after

PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE 
IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER], for 
construction permits and operating 
licenses under this part, and for design 
approvals, design certifications, and 
combined licenses under part 52 of this 
chapter, must meet the requirements for 
safety systems in IEEE Std 603–2018, 
dated September 27, 2018. When 
applying IEEE Std 603–2018, the first 
sentence within Clause 5.16, ‘‘Common-

See 12 U.S.C. 5902. The GENIUS Act defines a payment stablecoin as a digital asset 1) that is, or 
is designed to be, used as a means of payment or 
settlement and 2) the issuer of which is obligated 
to convert, redeem, or repurchase for a fixed 
amount of monetary value and represents or creates 
the reasonable expectation that it will maintain a 
stable value relative to a fixed amount of monetary 
value. 12 U.S.C. 5901(22)(A). The GENIUS Act 
further provides that a payment stablecoin is not a 
national currency, deposit, or security. 12 U.S.C.

I. Policy Objectives 
The FDIC is issuing this notice of 
proposed rulemaking (proposed rule) to 
implement certain application 
provisions under the GENIUS Act (or 
the Act).
1
The proposed rule would 
establish a tailored application process 
for an FDIC-supervised institution to 
obtain approval from the FDIC to issue 
payment stablecoins
2
through a 
subsidiary. The FDIC seeks to evaluate 
the safety and soundness of an 
applicant’s proposed activities based on 
consideration of statutory factors and 
support the responsible growth and use 
of digital assets and related 
technologies
3
while minimizing the 
regulatory burden on applicants. 
II. Background and Authority 
A. GENIUS Act Overview 
The GENIUS Act was enacted on July 
18, 2025, and will become effective on 
January 18, 2027, or 120 days after the 
date on which the primary Federal 
payment stablecoin regulators
4
issue 
any final implementing regulations, if 
earlier.
5
This proposed rule, once 
finalized, will implement the Federal 
statutory framework for applications for 
issuance of payment stablecoins and 
related payment stablecoin activities by 
subsidiaries of FDIC-supervised 
institutions for which the FDIC is the 
primary Federal payment stablecoin 
regulator, as defined under section 2 of 
the Act.
6
A subsidiary of an insured 
depository institution (IDI)
7
that has 
been approved to issue payment 
stablecoins under section 5 of the 
GENIUS Act is a permitted payment 
stablecoin issuer, or PPSI. 
Under the GENIUS Act, subject to 
certain limited exceptions, only a PPSI 
may issue a payment stablecoin in the 
United States. A PPSI is a person
8
 
formed in the United States that is (1) 
a subsidiary of an IDI approved by its 
primary Federal payment stablecoin 
regulator; (2) a Federal qualified 
payment stablecoin issuer approved by 
the OCC; or (3) a State-qualified 
payment stablecoin issuer approved by 
its State payment stablecoin regulator.
9
 
With respect to a PPSI that is a 
subsidiary of an IDI, the PPSI’s primary 
Federal payment stablecoin regulator is 
the same as the IDI’s appropriate 
Federal banking agency under section 3 
of the Federal Deposit Insurance (FDI)

See 12 U.S.C. 5901(1), (23), (25)(A); 12 U.S.C. 5904. 
11
The term ‘‘State nonmember bank’’ includes 
any insured State bank that is an industrial bank, 
industrial loan company, or other similar 
institution that is excluded from the definition of 
‘‘bank’’ in section 2(c)(2)(H) of the Bank Holding 
Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1841(c)(2)(H)). See FDI Act section 3(a)(2) (12 U.S.C. 1813(a)(2)); 12 CFR part 
347. 
12
See 12 U.S.C. 1813(q). As of September 30, 2025, the FDIC supervises approximately 2,772 
insured State nonmember banks and insured State 
savings associations. FDIC Call Report Data, 
September 30, 2025. The FDIC is also the 
appropriate Federal banking agency of any foreign 
bank having an insured State branch.

See 12 U.S.C. 5904(a)(1)(B). 14
See 12 U.S.C. 5904(a)(2). 15
See 12 U.S.C. 5904(g). 16
The GENIUS Act provides that an application 
is substantially complete if it contains sufficient 
information for the FDIC to render a decision on 
whether the applicant satisfies specified statutory 
factors. See 12 U.S.C. 5904(d)(1)(B)(i). For applications pending as of the effective date of the 
GENIUS Act, section 5(f) of the Act authorizes the 
FDIC to provide a safe harbor for an FDIC- 
supervised institution’s subsidiary and waive 
requirements under the GENIUS Act for up to 12 
months from the Act’s effective date. 12 U.S.C. 
5904(f). 
17
See 12 U.S.C. 5904(c). 18
12 U.S.C. 5904(d)(2)(A)(i). The GENIUS Act 
provides that the issuance of a payment stablecoin 
on an open, public, or decentralized network is not 
a valid basis for denying an application. 12 U.S.C.

12 U.S.C. 5903(a)(4)(A). The FDIC is currently 
developing proposed regulations that will be issued 
for public comment. Section 4(a)(5) of the GENIUS 
Act treats a PPSI as a financial institution for 
purposes of the BSA and subjects the PPSI to all 
applicable Federal laws relating to economic 
sanctions, prevention of money laundering, 
customer identification, and due diligence. See 12 U.S.C. 5903(a)(5)(A). The FDIC will consider any 
BSA and sanctions regulations that may be issued 
by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. 
27
If federally supervised, an approved PPSI can 
engage in custody and safekeeping services for 
payment stablecoin reserves, payment stablecoins 
used as collateral, and private keys used to issue 
permitted payment stablecoins. See 12 U.S.C. 5909(a). 
28
12 U.S.C. 5903(a)(7)(A). In addition to payment 
stablecoin activities of the PPSI, the FDIC- 
supervised institution may engage in certain 
payment stablecoin activities pursuant to section 
16(b) of the GENIUS Act. See 12 U.S.C. 5915(b). Issuance, however, is limited to the PPSI, which is 
the FDIC-supervised institution’s subsidiary.

See 12 U.S.C. 5903(a)(7)(B); 12 U.S.C. 5901(7) (defining digital asset service provider).

Act or the National Credit Union 
Administration, as applicable.
10
 
The FDIC is the appropriate Federal 
banking agency of each IDI that is a 
State-chartered insured bank that is not 
a member of the Federal Reserve System 
(State non-member bank)
11
and each 
State-chartered savings association 
(State savings association) (collectively, 
as noted above, FDIC-supervised 
institutions).
12
Accordingly, an FDIC- 
supervised institution must obtain 
approval for its subsidiary PPSI from the 
FDIC pursuant to the GENIUS Act and, 
once the application is approved, the 
FDIC will supervise that PPSI as its 
primary Federal payment stablecoin 
regulator. 
B. Statutory Requirements and 
Authority for Approving PPSI 
Applications 
1. Authority To Accept and Process 
PPSI Applications 
Section 5 of the GENIUS Act directs 
the FDIC, and the other primary Federal 
payment stablecoin regulators, to 
establish a process and Federal 
framework for the licensing, regulation, 
examination, and supervision of PPSIs 
that prioritizes the safety and soundness 
of such entities.
13
As required by the 
GENIUS Act, this proposed rule would 
establish a process and Federal 
framework for the acceptance and 
processing of PPSI applications
14
from 
FDIC-supervised institutions that is 
consistent with the requirements of the 
Act.
15
 
2. Overview of the Application Process 
In connection with the processing of 
applications to issue payment 
stablecoins, section 5 of the GENIUS Act 
includes specific timelines, evaluation 
criteria, and appeal rights for denied 
applicants. 
The FDIC is required to evaluate and 
make a determination on a substantially 
complete application
16
using the factors 
listed in section 5(c) of the GENIUS Act, 
including the subsidiary’s ability to 
meet statutory and regulatory 
requirements and other factors related to 
management and safety and 
soundness.
17
These factors are 
discussed in greater detail in section 
II.B.3 of this document. The GENIUS 
Act provides that the FDIC shall only 
deny an application upon determining 
that the activities of the applicant 
(including the proposed activities of the 
subsidiary) would be unsafe or unsound 
based on the factors.
18
 
If the FDIC denies an application, it 
must provide the applicant with an 
opportunity to appeal. The GENIUS Act 
sets forth specific timelines for 
requesting an appeal, holding a hearing, 
and issuing a final decision, but is silent 
on the modus for appeal.
19
Lastly, the 
GENIUS Act states that a denial does 
not prohibit an applicant from filing a 
subsequent application.
20
 
3. Required Factors for the Evaluation of 
Applications 
a. Ability To Meet Requirements for 
Issuing Payment Stablecoins Under 
Section 4 of the GENIUS Act 
When evaluating an application, 
section 5(c)(1) of the GENIUS Act 
provides that the FDIC is required to 
consider the ability of the IDI’s 
subsidiary, based on financial condition 
and resources, to meet the requirements 
for issuing payment stablecoins set forth 
in section 4 of the GENIUS Act.
21
 
Section 4 sets out standards for the 
issuance of payment stablecoins by 
PPSIs.
22
Section 4 requires that a PPSI 
maintain identifiable reserves backing 
the outstanding payment stablecoins on 
at least a 1 to 1 basis, comprised of 
specified categories of reserves,
23
and 
the ability to relatedly meet the monthly 
reserve disclosure requirements 
applicable to a PPSI. The reserve 
disclosure requirements include 
disclosing the composition of the PPSI’s 
reserves on its website
24
and submitting 
to the FDIC certified reports examined 
by a public accounting firm regarding 
the prior month’s reserve composition 
disclosure.
25
 
Additionally, the FDIC is required to 
consider the ability of the IDI’s 
subsidiary, based on financial condition 
and resources, to comply with 
forthcoming regulations to be issued by 
the FDIC regarding capital requirements; 
liquidity requirements; reserve asset 
diversification; and operational, 
compliance, and information technology 
risk management principles-based 
requirements and standards, including 
Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and sanctions 
compliance standards.
26
 
Section 4 also establishes certain 
limitations on a PPSI’s activities and 
generally only permits PPSIs to issue 
and redeem payment stablecoins, 
manage related reserves, provide certain 
payment stablecoin and reserve 
custodial and safekeeping services,
27
 
undertake other activities that directly 
support those activities,
28
and engage in 
digital asset service provider 
activities.
29
In addition, section 4 
establishes, subject to limited 
exceptions, a prohibition on pledging, 
rehypothecating, or reusing a PPSI’s 
reserves assets.
30
 
b. Factors Related to Management 
The FDIC is also required to consider 
factors related to management described 
in sections 5(c)(2) and 5(c)(3) of the 
GENIUS Act. Section 5(c)(2) requires the 
FDIC to consider whether an individual 
that has been convicted of a felony

Section 3(w)(4) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 
1813(w)(4)) states that the term ‘‘subsidiary’’ (1) 
means any company which is owned or controlled 
directly or indirectly by another company; and (2) 
includes any service corporation owned in whole 
or in part by an insured depository institution or 
any subsidiary of such a service corporation. 
offense involving insider trading, 
embezzlement, cybercrime, money 
laundering, financing of terrorism, or 
financial fraud is serving as an officer or 
director of the applicant.
31
Section 
5(c)(3) requires the FDIC to consider the 
competence, experience, and integrity of 
the officers, directors, and principal 
shareholders of the applicant, its 
subsidiaries, and parent company, 
including the record of compliance with 
laws and regulations and ability to 
fulfill any commitments and conditions 
of the FDIC in connection with the 
application and prior applications.
32
 
c. Redemption Policy 
Under section 5(c)(4) of the GENIUS 
Act, the FDIC is required to consider 
whether the applicant’s redemption 
policy can meet the standards specified 
under section 4(a)(1)(B).
33
This includes 
whether the applicant has established 
clear and conspicuous procedures for 
timely redemption of outstanding 
payment stablecoins;
34
whether the 
PPSI will publicly, clearly, and 
conspicuously disclose, in plain 
language, all fees associated with 
purchasing or redeeming its payment 
stablecoins;
35
and whether the PPSI 
will meet the prohibition on changing 
such fees without at least 7 days’ prior 
notice to consumers.
36
 
d. Other Factors 
Lastly, section 5(c)(5) of the GENIUS 
Act allows the FDIC to establish and 
consider any other factors as necessary 
to ensure the safety and soundness of 
the PPSI when evaluating an 
application.
37
The FDIC is not 
proposing to establish any additional 
factors pursuant to section 5(c)(5) of the 
GENIUS Act at this time. 
III. Description of the Proposed Rule 
A. Overview of the Proposed 
Application Procedures 
To implement the statutory 
requirements described above, the 
proposed rule would add a new 
§ 303.252 to title 12, part 303, subpart M 
of the FDIC Rules and Regulations, 
titled ‘‘Permitted payment stablecoin 
issuers.’’ This new section would apply 
to FDIC-supervised institutions that 
seek to issue payment stablecoins 
through a subsidiary. The proposed 
rule, as described below, addresses 
scope; definitions; filing location; 
contents of the filing; additional 
information for applications; processing 
decisions; and hearing and appeal 
procedures and final determination. The 
proposed rule would implement the 
requirements of section 5 of the GENIUS 
Act with respect to evaluating the 
factors, processing applications within 
specified timeframes, and establishing 
an appeal process. As required under 
the GENIUS Act, the FDIC would only 
deny an application if the activities of 
the applicant would be unsafe or 
unsound based on the factors described 
in section 5(c) of the Act. 
B. Description of Proposed Application 
Procedures 
1. Scope 
Paragraph (a) of proposed § 303.252 
would establish the scope of the 
proposed section. It would state that 
proposed § 303.252 sets forth the 
application requirements and 
procedures for an FDIC-supervised 
institution to submit an application to 
issue payment stablecoins through a 
subsidiary that would become a PPSI 
under the GENIUS Act. 
2. Definitions 
Paragraph (b) would define relevant 
terms for purposes of proposed 
§ 303.252. The term ‘‘applicant’’ would 
mean an FDIC-insured State nonmember 
bank or an FDIC-insured State savings 
association that seeks to issue payment 
stablecoins through a subsidiary. This 
definition would distinguish the 
applicant—the FDIC-supervised 
institution—from the PPSI subsidiary 
through which the institution would 
issue payment stablecoins and perform 
certain other payment stablecoin 
activities permitted by the GENIUS Act. 
‘‘Digital asset service provider,’’ 
‘‘payment stablecoin,’’ and ‘‘permitted 
payment stablecoin issuer’’ would be 
defined by referencing the relevant 
definitions in section 2 of the GENIUS 
Act. The terms ‘‘State nonmember 
bank,’’ ‘‘State savings association,’’ and 
‘‘subsidiary’’ would have the meanings 
given those terms in section 3 of the FDI 
Act.
38
Finally, the term ‘‘substantially 
complete’’ would be defined in a 
manner consistent with the standard set 
forth in section 5(d)(1)(B)(i) of the 
GENIUS Act. 
3. Filing Location 
Paragraph (c) of proposed § 303.252 
would state that applications under the 
new section shall be filed with the 
appropriate FDIC region, as defined in 
12 CFR 303.2(g), which is consistent 
with the FDIC’s practice for receiving 
other types of applications. 
4. Contents of Filing 
Paragraph (d) of proposed § 303.252 
would describe the contents of the 
filing. Under the proposed rule, the 
applicant would submit information to 
the FDIC in the form of a letter 
application that would contain the 
information listed in the regulation, to 
the extent applicable. Paragraph (d) 
would minimize the regulatory burden 
for applicants by requesting only 
information necessary to evaluate the 
factors to be considered under section 
5(c) of the GENIUS Act and to 
determine the safety and soundness of 
the proposed activities of the applicant, 
inclusive of the activities of its 
subsidiary. Whenever possible, the FDIC 
would utilize information already 
available to it as the primary Federal 
regulator of the applicant, such as 
supervisory and examination 
information, rather than requiring 
duplicative information to be submitted 
as part of an application. Given that the 
applicant would be an FDIC-supervised 
institution, known to the appropriate 
region, the FDIC, at this time, has not 
proposed to establish any additional 
factors pursuant to section 5(c)(5) of the 
GENIUS Act. The applicant may, 
however, include any other materials or 
information that it would like the FDIC 
to consider. 
Proposed paragraph (d)(1) would 
require a description of the proposed 
payment stablecoin and the proposed 
activities of the subsidiary of the 
applicant, including related activities of 
the applicant, how the subsidiary plans 
to maintain the proposed payment 
stablecoin’s stable value, or the 
reasonable expectation thereof, and any 
proposed incidental activities to the 
payment stablecoin activities or digital 
asset service provider activities. The 
FDIC would expect that the applicant’s 
materials provide a description of the 
characteristics and features of the 
proposed payment stablecoin as well as 
the identities, roles, and responsibilities 
of the entities involved in the proposed 
payment stablecoin activities. The FDIC 
would expect applicants to describe 
what activities would be performed at 
the applicant and subsidiary levels 
regarding the proposed payment 
stablecoin, as well as whether any third 
parties would participate in the

proposed payment stablecoin activity. 
In addition, when describing how the 
subsidiary plans to maintain the 
proposed payment stablecoin’s stable 
value, or the reasonable expectation 
thereof, the FDIC would expect the 
application to include whether there are 
any planned applicant-provided sources 
of strength, applicant guarantees, and/or 
intercompany agreements. Finally, the 
FDIC would expect a description of any 
proposed incidental activities of the 
applicant or the subsidiary to payment 
stablecoin activities or digital asset 
service provider activities, and those 
that directly support activities that a 
PPSI may undertake in accordance with 
section 4(a)(7)(A) of the GENIUS Act. 
The FDIC is proposing to include this 
information in the contents of the filing 
because understanding the proposed 
payment stablecoin and proposed 
activities of the subsidiary, including 
related activities of the applicant, the 
mechanism to maintain the proposed 
payment stablecoin’s stable value or the 
reasonable expectation thereof, and any 
proposed incidental activities and 
digital asset service provider activities 
of the subsidiary are necessary to 
evaluate the ability of the subsidiary in 
light of its financial condition and 
resources to meet the requirements set 
forth under section 4 of the GENIUS 
Act. Furthermore, information on the 
proposed payment stablecoin and 
related activities would be necessary for 
the FDIC to determine whether the 
activities of the applicant would be 
unsafe or unsound based on the factors 
described in section 5(c), which is the 
sole basis for any denial.
39
 
Proposed paragraph (d)(2) would 
request relevant financial information 
for the subsidiary, including planned 
capital and liquidity structure; reserve 
assets and composition and associated 
asset management plan; and financial 
projections for the first three years of 
operations. With respect to a planned 
capital and liquidity structure, the FDIC 
may consider any planned financial 
commitments from the applicant’s or 
subsidiary’s officers, directors, and 
principals or shareholders, or if there is 
a plan to launch the payment stablecoin 
as part of a consortium approach. The 
FDIC would expect that information 
provided on reserve assets and 
composition and their associated asset 
management plan to include a 
description of whether any reserves are 
proposed to be in tokenized form. In 
addition, the FDIC would expect that 
the asset management plan to contain 
details of how the applicant or 
subsidiary would manage the reserves, 
including how reserve assets are 
expected to change and what would 
prompt such a change in reserves. The 
FDIC would further expect the relevant 
financial information, including capital 
and liquidity, reserve assets and 
composition, and the associated asset 
management plan, to demonstrate 
consistency with forthcoming 
regulations that would implement the 
standards required by section 4 of the 
GENIUS Act. Finally, the applicant 
would provide financial projections for 
the first three years of the subsidiary’s 
operations. Such content would 
generally align with the FDIC’s practice 
of requesting three years of pro forma 
financial statements as a component of 
other applications, such as with mergers 
and deposit insurance applications for 
de novo institutions. The information in 
this proposed paragraph would be 
relevant to the FDIC’s consideration of 
the factor in section 5(c)(1) of the 
GENIUS Act regarding the ability of the 
subsidiary, based on financial condition 
and resources, to meet the requirements 
set forth under section 4 of the Act. 
Proposed paragraph (d)(3) would state 
that an application shall contain a 
description of the subsidiary’s 
ownership and control structure; 
organizing documents; and a list of the 
subsidiary’s proposed directors, officers, 
and shareholders (if different from the 
applicant), including a statement as to 
whether any of the proposed directors 
and officers have been convicted of a 
felony offense involving insider trading, 
embezzlement, cybercrime, money 
laundering, financing of terrorism, or 
financial fraud. The FDIC could accept 
an organizational chart that includes the 
requisite information to show the 
subsidiary’s ownership and control 
structure. The FDIC could accept 
proposed or draft organizing documents 
initially, with final versions to be 
provided when available, either prior to 
FDIC approval, or subsequently as a 
condition of the FDIC’s approval. If a 
proposed payment stablecoin is to be 
backed or offered by multiple banks 
through a consortium structured as a 
subsidiary of an FDIC-supervised 
institution, the FDIC would expect the 
application to include the governance 
structure of such arrangement, 
including expected activities of the 
other members of the consortium. The 
FDIC would anticipate accepting and 
processing a single application on 
behalf of all other FDIC-supervised 
members of the consortium if the 
consortium could be considered a 
subsidiary of each. The FDIC is 
proposing to include this information in 
the contents of the filing because it is 
necessary to resolve the factors set forth 
in sections 5(c)(2) and 5(c)(3) of the 
GENIUS Act. 
Proposed paragraph (d)(4) would 
require submission of relevant policies 
and procedures and customer 
agreements, including for custody and 
safekeeping; segregating customer and 
reserve assets; recordkeeping; 
reconciliation and transaction 
processing; redemption; and BSA/anti- 
money laundering (AML)/countering 
the financing of terrorism (CFT) and 
economic sanctions requirements 
pursuant to section 4(a)(5) of the 
GENIUS Act. When including relevant 
policies and procedures and customer 
agreements, the FDIC would expect the 
applicant to include terms of use, 
privacy disclosures, any public 
disclosures required under the GENIUS 
Act, and any disclosures required by 
other applicable laws and regulations. 
Policies and procedures such as those 
related to custody and safekeeping, 
segregating customer and reserve assets, 
recordkeeping, reconciliation, and 
transaction processing would be 
relevant for the FDIC to evaluate the 
financial condition and resources 
affecting the ability of the subsidiary to 
meet the requirements set forth under 
section 4 of the GENIUS Act, pursuant 
to the factor set forth in section 5(c)(1) 
of the GENIUS Act. Such information is 
relevant to the FDIC’s evaluation, based 
on the financial condition and resources 
of the subsidiary, of whether it would be 
able to maintain the proposed payment 
stablecoin’s stable value or reasonable 
expectation thereof, the ability of the 
subsidiary to meet customer redemption 
requests, and the accuracy of public 
disclosures of reserve assets. The FDIC 
would review any recordkeeping, 
reconciliation, and transaction 
processing policies and procedures, 
including both on- and off-chain 
procedures. The FDIC would expect the 
redemption policy, required by section 
4(a)(1)(B) of the GENIUS Act, to explain 
the responsibilities and obligations of 
the applicant and the subsidiary, the 
process, conditions, and time period by 
which the payment stablecoin may be 
redeemed, who may redeem the 
payment stablecoin, and the 
circumstances under which the 
redemption of the payment stablecoin 
may be limited, delayed, or suspended. 
Additionally, the submission of BSA/ 
AML/CFT and economic sanctions 
information would be necessary to 
evaluate whether the subsidiary would 
be able to comply with requirements 
under section 4 pursuant to the factor in 
section 5(c)(1) of the GENIUS Act. The 
submission of the policies, procedures,

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with PROPOSALS159413 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Proposed Rules and customer agreements enumerated in 
proposed paragraph (d)(4) is each 
designed to allow the FDIC to evaluate 
the factors in section 5(c) of the GENIUS 
Act and determine whether the 
activities of the applicant would be 
unsafe or unsound. 
Finally, proposed paragraph (d)(5) 
would require inclusion of an 
engagement letter with a registered 
public accounting firm. This 
information is intended to demonstrate 
that the applicant’s subsidiary would be 
able to comply with the examination of 
monthly reserve reports and 
certification requirements in section 4 of 
the GENIUS Act, which is necessary for 
the FDIC to evaluate the factors in 
section 5(c)(1) of the GENIUS Act. 
5. Additional Information 
Paragraph (e) of proposed § 303.252 
would specify that the FDIC may 
request additional information as it 
deems necessary solely for its 
consideration of the factors listed in 
section 5(c) of the GENIUS Act. As 
described above, to the extent possible, 
the FDIC would use information 
available to it as the primary Federal 
regulator of the applicant rather than 
requesting duplicative information. 
6. Processing 
Paragraph (f) of proposed § 303.252 
would describe application processing, 
following the requirements and 
timelines established by the GENIUS 
Act. Pursuant to section 5(d)(1)(B)(ii) of 
the GENIUS Act, the FDIC would notify 
an applicant as to whether the 
application is considered substantially 
complete not later than 30 days after the 
FDIC receives an application under the 
proposed section. At that time, if the 
application is not considered 
substantially complete—i.e., the application does not contain sufficient 
information for the FDIC to render a 
decision on whether the applicant 
satisfies the factors described in section 
5(c) of the GENIUS Act—the FDIC shall 
specify the additional information the 
applicant shall provide for the 
application to be considered 
substantially complete. Examples of 
instances where the FDIC might not 
consider an application to be 
substantially complete include if it does 
not provide all of the items required by 
regulation, if the information provided 
contains significant gaps or is unclear in 
any material respect, or if the FDIC 
determines that there are issues or 
deficiencies in the information provided 
that must be resolved or supplied for the 
FDIC to be able to adequately consider 
the GENIUS Act factors. This proposed 
paragraph would also state that, 
following notification by the FDIC that 
the application is considered 
substantially complete, the applicant 
shall notify the FDIC if there is a 
material change in circumstances that 
would require the FDIC to treat the 
pending application as a new 
application, pursuant to section 
5(d)(1)(B)(iii) of the GENIUS Act. Such 
material changes may include a change 
to the applicant’s financial condition, 
the proposed activities of the PPSI, or 
any other change that could implicate 
the safety or soundness of the applicant. 
The proposed rule would provide that if 
the FDIC fails to notify the applicant 
within 30 days after receiving an 
application, the application shall be 
deemed substantially complete as of the 
date it was received by the FDIC. 
7. Decisions 
The GENIUS Act establishes the 
Federal payment stablecoin regulators’ 
decision-making process regarding an 
application, such as timing, 
considerations, and notices. Therefore, 
paragraph (g) of proposed § 303.252 
would largely follow the language of the 
GENIUS Act in describing the FDIC’s 
decision-making process. It would state 
that the FDIC shall approve or deny an 
application not later than 120 days after 
receiving a substantially complete 
application under proposed § 303.252. 
In accordance with section 5(d) of the 
GENIUS Act, proposed paragraph (g)(1) 
would provide for deemed approval, 
stating that if the FDIC does not render 
a decision on a substantially complete 
application within 120 days of receiving 
a substantially complete application, the 
application shall be deemed approved. 
Proposed paragraph (g)(2), regarding 
approval with conditions, would state 
that the FDIC may impose conditions 
upon approving an application, 
including the standard conditions 
defined under 12 CFR 303.2(bb), and 
that such conditions shall not impose 
requirements in addition to the 
requirements of section 4 of the GENIUS 
Act. The FDIC generally intends for 
approval with conditions to include 
routine items. This may include, for 
example, the submission of items that 
were not included or finalized in the 
application, such as final organizing 
documents, or fulfillment of 
commitments of the applicant such as 
capital injections. Finally, proposed 
paragraph (g)(3) would describe the 
FDIC’s denial of an application. The 
proposed paragraph would state, in 
accordance with the grounds for denial 
provided by section 5(d)(1) of the 
GENIUS Act, that the FDIC shall deny 
a substantially complete application if 
the activities of the applicant would be 
unsafe or unsound based on the factors 
to be considered. In accordance with the 
response and timelines required by 
section 5(d)(2) of the GENIUS Act, the 
proposed paragraph would also state 
that the FDIC shall provide the 
applicant with written notice of the 
basis for denial not later than 30 days 
after the date of such denial with an 
explanation that shall include all 
findings made by the FDIC with respect 
to all identified material shortcomings 
in the application, including 
recommendations to address such 
shortcomings. As described above, the 
FDIC’s proposed paragraph (g) largely 
follows and reiterates the provisions of 
the GENIUS Act regarding decisions on 
applications. 
8. Appeal and Final Determination 
Section 5(d)(2)(C) of the GENIUS Act 
provides for hearing and appeal 
processes following denial of an 
application, which would be 
implemented by proposed paragraph 
(h). In accordance with the GENIUS Act, 
proposed paragraph (h)(1) would state 
that not later than 30 days after the 
receipt of a denial of an application 
under the proposed section, the 
applicant may request, in writing, a 
written or oral hearing before the FDIC. 
Under the proposed rule, for purposes 
of an appeal, the FDIC would treat a 
denial of a PPSI application as akin to 
a material supervisory determination, 
requiring a denied applicant to follow 
procedures similar to the process for an 
appeal of a material supervisory 
determination but within the timelines 
provided under the GENIUS Act. 
Proposed paragraph (h)(2) would 
provide the timing for such a hearing. It 
would state that upon receipt of a timely 
request for a written or oral hearing, the 
FDIC shall issue a notice of the time and 
place for the applicant to submit written 
materials or provide oral testimony and 
oral argument. The time for the hearing 
would be within 30 days of receipt of 
the request for hearing, in accordance 
with the required timeline of the 
GENIUS Act. Proposed paragraph (h)(3) 
would state that the FDIC shall notify 
the applicant of its final determination 
not later than 60 days after the date of 
a hearing, which shall contain a 
statement of the basis for that 
determination, with specific findings. 
Finally, pursuant to the GENIUS Act, 
proposed paragraph (h)(4) would 
describe the notice provided by the 
FDIC if there is no hearing. The FDIC 
would provide written notice to the 
applicant who does not make a timely 
request for a hearing that the denial of 
the application is the final 
determination. Such notice would be

Bureau of Labor Statistics: National Industry-

Employer Cost of Employee Compensation (March 
2024), and Employment Cost Index (March 2024

labor allocation for entities complying with these 
requirements: Executives and Managers (11–0000): 
60 percent; Lawyers (23–0000): 30 percent; and 
Clerical workers (43–0000): 10 percent.

The SBA defines a small banking organization 
as having $850 million or less in assets and 
determines an organization’s assets by averaging the 
assets reported on its four quarterly financial 
statements for the preceding year. See 13 CFR 121.201 (as amended by 87 FR 69118, effective 
December 19, 2022). Following these regulations, 
the FDIC uses an FDIC-supervised institution’s 
affiliated and acquired assets, averaged over the 
preceding four quarters, to determine whether the 
FDIC-supervised institution is ‘‘small’’ for the 
purposes of the RFA. 
provided not later than 10 days after the 
date by which the applicant could have 
requested the hearing under proposed 
paragraph (h)(1). Conforming edits are 
also proposed in § 303.11(f) to cross 
reference the process under proposed 
§ 303.252, which would exclude appeals 
of denials under this section from 
existing processes and procedures under 
existing 12 CFR parts 303 and 308 of the 
FDIC Rules and Regulations. 
C. Regarding Safe Harbor for Pending 
Applications 
Consistent with section 5(f) of the 
GENIUS Act, an applicant could request 
a waiver of certain requirements of the 
GENIUS Act regarding a pending 
application. An applicant would be able 
to submit an application to the FDIC 
pursuant to proposed § 330.252 upon a 
final rule becoming effective, which is 
anticipated to be prior to the effective 
date of the GENIUS Act. If an applicant 
files an application ahead of the 
effective date of the Act, pursuant to 
section 5(f) of the Act, the applicant 
may request a waiver from the FDIC 
from all or some of the requirements 
under the Act, with any granted waiver 
not to exceed 12 months from the 
effective date of the Act. The FDIC 
would invite an applicant to submit, 
together with an application, a written 
request for a waiver in writing that 
explains the basis for the request, the 
extent of the requirements to be waived, 
and the time period sought. The FDIC 
has determined not to include a 
provision regarding procedures for 
requesting a waiver under the GENIUS 
Act’s safe harbor provision due to the 
temporary nature of the provision and 
the case-by-case analysis required for 
any waiver. 
IV. Expected Effects 
As previously discussed, the FDIC is 
proposing to amend its regulations to 
implement application requirements 
and procedures for an FDIC-supervised 
institution to request approval to issue 
payment stablecoins through a 
subsidiary in accordance with 
provisions of the GENIUS Act. The 
proposed rule would establish 
application requirements and 
procedures to address the factors for 
consideration as outlined in 12 U.S.C. 
5904(c). 
To estimate the expected effects of the 
proposed rule, this analysis considered 
all relevant regulations applicable to 
FDIC-supervised institutions, as well as 
information on the financial condition 
of FDIC-supervised institutions as of the 
quarter ending September 30, 2025, as 
the baseline to which the effects of the 
proposed rule are estimated. 
As previously discussed, the 
proposed rule would apply to all FDIC- 
supervised institutions that seek to issue 
payment stablecoins through a 
subsidiary as well as engage in certain 
other payment stablecoin activities 
permitted by the GENIUS Act.
40
As of 
the quarter ending September 30, 2025, 
there were 2,772 insured State 
nonmember banks and State savings 
associations.
41
The FDIC recognizes the 
significant uncertainty regarding 
estimates of the number of FDIC- 
supervised institutions that would seek 
to issue payment stablecoins or engage 
in other permitted payment stablecoin 
activities through a subsidiary in future 
periods and, thereby, be directly 
affected by the proposed rule. As this is 
a developing market, there is 
uncertainty as to the number of FDIC- 
supervised institutions that might apply 
to issue payment stablecoins, either 
independently or through consortia and 
other partnerships. Without predicting 
the actual participation rate, for the 
purposes of this analysis, the FDIC 
assumed that 10 FDIC-supervised 
institutions would file an application 
each year, on average. 
The FDIC estimates that in applying, 
FDIC-supervised institutions seeking 
approval to issue payment stablecoins 
and engage in certain other payment 
stablecoin activities through a 
subsidiary would expend 80 labor hours 
to comply with the proposed 
application requirements. As stated 
above, the intent of the proposed rule is 
to minimize the regulatory burden for 
applicants by requesting only 
information necessary to evaluate the 
factors to be considered under section 
5(c) of the GENIUS Act and to 
determine the safety and soundness of 
the proposed activities of the applicant, 
inclusive of the activities of its 
subsidiary. To the extent possible, the 
FDIC has tailored and streamlined the 
application process and would use 
information already available to it as the 
primary Federal regulator of the 
applicant rather than requiring 
duplicative information to be submitted 
as part of an application. At an 
estimated total compensation rate of 
$152.40 per hour,
42
the proposed rule 
would result in estimated application 
compliance costs of $12,192 per 
institution or $121,920 in aggregate each 
year, on average.
43
The FDIC believes 
that the application requirements as 
proposed effectively balance the 
collection of information necessary to 
address the factors for consideration 
established by the GENIUS Act while 
containing burden on the applicant. 
V. Alternatives Considered 
The FDIC is proposing to amend its 
regulations to implement certain 
provisions of the GENIUS Act. Because 
the amendments are statutorily 
mandated, the FDIC did not consider 
alternatives to the proposed rule. 
VI. Regulatory Analysis 
A. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
generally requires an agency, in 
connection with a proposed rule, to 
prepare and make available for public 
comment an initial regulatory flexibility 
analysis that describes the impact of the 
proposed rule on small entities.
44
 
However, an initial regulatory flexibility 
analysis is not required if the agency 
certifies that the proposed rule would 
not, if promulgated, have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. The Small 
Business Administration (SBA) has 
defined ‘‘small entities’’ to include 
banking organizations with total assets 
of less than or equal to $850 million.
45
 
Generally, the FDIC considers a 
significant economic impact to be a 
quantified effect in excess of 5 percent 
of total annual salaries and benefits or 
2.5 percent of total noninterest 
expenses. The FDIC believes that effects 
in excess of one or more of these 
thresholds typically represent 
significant economic impacts for FDIC- 
insured institutions. 
To estimate the expected effects of the 
proposed rule, this analysis considered 
all relevant regulations applicable to 
FDIC-supervised institutions, as well as 
information on the financial condition 
of such FDIC-supervised institutions as 
of the quarter ending June 30, 2025.

As previously discussed, the 
proposed rule would apply to all FDIC- 
supervised institutions that seek to issue 
payment stablecoins through a 
subsidiary as well as engage in certain 
other payment stablecoin activities 
permitted by the GENIUS Act.
46
As of 
the quarter ending June 30, 2025, there 
were 2,802 insured State nonmember 
banks and State savings associations. Of 
those institutions, 2,085 are considered 
‘‘small’’ for the purposes of RFA.
47
The 
FDIC recognizes the considerable 
uncertainty regarding estimates of the 
number of FDIC-supervised institutions 
that would seek to issue payment 
stablecoins or engage in other permitted 
payment stablecoin activities through a 
subsidiary in future periods and, 
thereby, be directly affected by the 
proposed rule. As this is a developing 
market, there is uncertainty as to the 
number of FDIC-supervised institutions 
that might apply to issue payment 
stablecoins, either independently or 
through consortia and other 
partnerships. Without predicting the 
actual participation rate, for the 
purposes of this analysis the FDIC 
assumed that all 10 estimated annual 
applicants seeking to issue payment 
stablecoins through a subsidiary would 
be small, FDIC-supervised institutions. 
As previously discussed, the FDIC 
estimates that FDIC-supervised 
institutions seeking approval to issue 
payment stablecoins through a 
subsidiary would expend 80 labor hours 
to comply with the proposed 
application requirements. At an 
estimated total compensation rate of 
$152.40 per hour,
48
the proposed rule 
would result in application compliance 
costs of $12,192 per small, FDIC- 
supervised institution or $121,920 in 
aggregate, on average.
49
Estimated 
application costs of $12,192 per small, 
FDIC-supervised institution exceeds 5 
percent of total annual salaries and 
benefits or 2.5 percent of total 
noninterest expenses for no more than 
three small, FDIC-supervised 
institutions.
50
 
In light of the foregoing, the FDIC 
certifies that the proposed rule would 
not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small 
entities. Accordingly, an initial 
regulatory flexibility analysis is not 
required. 
The FDIC invites comments on all 
aspects of the supporting information 
provided in this RFA section. The FDIC 
is particularly interested in comments 
on any significant effects on small 
entities that the agency has not 
identified. 
B. Paperwork Reduction Act 
Certain provisions of the proposed 
rule contain ‘‘collections of 
information’’ within the meaning of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 
1995.
51
In accordance with the 
requirements of the PRA, the FDIC may 
not conduct or sponsor, and the 
respondent is not required to respond 
to, an information collection unless it 
displays a currently valid Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) control 
number. The information collections 
contained in the proposed rule have 
been submitted to OMB for review and 
approval by the FDIC under section 
3507(d) of the PRA
52
and 5 CFR 1320.11 
of OMB’s implementing regulations.
53
 
The FDIC is proposing a new 
information collection. 
Title of information Collection: 
Payment stablecoin issuer application 
for FDIC-supervised institutions. 
OMB Number: 3064–NEW. 
Frequency of Response: Periodic—see 
table below. 
Affected Public: Businesses or other 
for-profit. 
Respondents: Insured State nonmember banks and insured State 
savings associations that seek to issue 
payment stablecoins through a 
subsidiary. 
Current Actions: The proposed rule 
would establish procedures to be 
followed by an insured State 
nonmember bank or State savings 
association that seeks to obtain FDIC 
approval to issue payment stablecoins 
through a subsidiary pursuant to the 
GENIUS Act.

Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach- 
Bliley Act
54
requires the Federal 
banking agencies to use plain language 
in all proposed and final rules 
published after January 1, 2000. The 
FDIC invites your comments on how to 
make the proposed rule easier to 
understand. For example: 
€Has the FDIC organized the material to suit your needs? If not, how could the 
proposed rule be more clearly stated? 
€Are the requirements in the proposed rule clearly stated? If not, how 
could the proposed rule be more clearly 
stated? 
€Does the proposed rule contain language or jargon that is not clear? If 
so, which language requires 
clarification? 
€Would a different format (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, 
paragraphing) make the proposed rule 
easier to understand? If so, what 
changes to the format would make the 
proposed rule easier to understand? 
€What else could the FDIC do to make the proposed rule easier to 
understand? 
D. Riegle Community Development and 
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 
Pursuant to section 302(a) of the 
Riegle Community Development and 
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 
(RCDRIA),
55
in determining the effective 
date and administrative compliance 
requirements for new regulations that 
impose additional reporting, disclosure, 
or other requirements on insured 
depository institutions,
56
each Federal 
banking agency must consider, 
consistent with principles of safety and 
soundness and the public interest, any 
administrative burdens that such 
regulations would place on affected 
depository institutions, including small 
depository institutions, and customers 
of depository institutions, as well as the 
benefits of such regulations. In addition, 
section 302(b) of the RCDRIA requires 
new regulations and amendments to 
regulations that impose additional 
reporting, disclosures, or other new 
requirements on insured depository 
institutions generally to take effect on 
the first day of a calendar quarter that 
begins on or after the date on which the 
regulations are published in final form. 
The FDIC invites comments that further 
will inform its consideration of the 
RCDRIA.

F. Executive Order 12866 and 14192 
Executive Order 12866, as amended, 
directs agencies to assess the costs and 
benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits. 
This proposed rule was drafted and 
reviewed in accordance with Executive 
Order 12866. Within OMB, the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs 
(OIRA) has determined that this 
rulemaking is a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ under section 3(f) of Executive 
Order 12866. Accordingly, the draft rule 
was submitted to OIRA for review. As 
noted in other sections of the 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATIONof this 
document, the FDIC has assessed the 
costs and benefits of this rulemaking 
and has made a reasoned determination 
that the benefits of this rulemaking 
justify its costs. This proposed rule, if 
finalized as proposed, is not expected to 
be a regulatory action under Executive 
Order 14192 because it imposes no more 
than de minimis costs. 
VII. Request for Comment 
The FDIC invites comments on all 
aspects of this proposed rulemaking. In 
particular, the FDIC seeks feedback on 
the scope of the proposed rule and its 
requirements, and responses to the 
following specific questions: 
Question 1: Does the proposed rule 
adequately reflect the application 
process outlined by Congress in the 
GENIUS Act? How could the proposed 
rule be improved to better align with the 
GENIUS Act’s application 
requirements? 
Question 2: The proposed rule would 
require applicants to submit a letter 
application. Should the FDIC consider 
requiring applicants to instead submit a 
structured form to be developed by the 
FDIC? What are the advantages and 
disadvantages of each approach? 
Question 3: Are the proposed filing 
content requirements appropriate to 
garner sufficient information for the 
FDIC to evaluate the factors described in 
section 5(c) of the GENIUS Act? Is it 
clear what information the FDIC would 
expect the contents of a filing to contain 
under the proposed rule? Are there 
additional types of information the FDIC 
should consider? Should the FDIC seek 
to remove any of the proposed types of 
information? If so, please explain how 
the addition or removal of such 
information would facilitate the FDIC’s 
consideration of the factors. 
Question 4: Among the factors to be 
considered and listed in section 5(c), the 
FDIC may establish any other factors to 
be considered. The FDIC is not 
proposing to establish other factors 
beyond those listed in the GENIUS Act 
as indicated by the proposed rule. 
Should the FDIC consider other factors? 
If so, please describe the additional 
factors that the FDIC should consider 
and why they would be necessary to 
consider whether the activities of the 
applicant would potentially be unsafe or 
unsound. 
Question 5: What types of information 
should applicants submit to the FDIC to 
substantiate the sufficiency of their 
capital or liquidity structures? What 
information can best demonstrate the 
appropriate composition, custody, and 
valuation of the reserve assets backing 
the payment stablecoin? 
Question 6: What types of ownership 
or control structures of PPSIs may be 
proposed that the FDIC has not 
considered? Does the proposed rule 
capture the types of information the 
FDIC would need about such ownership 
or control structures to evaluate the 
factors? Why or why not? 
Question 7: Does the proposed rule 
effectively capture the types of policies, 
procedures, and customer agreements of 
the applicant and/or PPSI necessary to 
evaluate the factors? What information 
could be eliminated or added in the 
proposed rule to allow the FDIC to 
evaluate the factors while minimizing 
application burden? 
Question 8: The FDIC has determined 
not to include a provision in the 
proposed regulatory text regarding 
procedures for requesting a waiver 
under the GENIUS Act’s safe harbor 
provision due to the temporary nature of 
the provision and the case-by-case 
analysis required for any waiver. Should 
the FDIC include regulatory text on this 
provision? Why or why not? In what 
circumstances might an applicant 
request a waiver of provisions of the 
GENIUS Act, and what provisions 
would the applicant request to be 
waived? 
Question 9: Does the proposed appeal 
process effectively protect an 
applicant’s due process, minimize 
regulatory burden, and meet the 
requirements of the GENIUS Act? Are

number of applications received under 
this section and the potential costs of 
such applications likely to be accurate?

have any costs, benefits, or other effects

Authority and Issuance 
For the reasons stated in the 
preamble, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation proposes to amend 12 CFR 
part 303 as follows: 
PART 303—FILING PROCEDURES 
1. Revise the authority citation for part 
303 to read as follows: 
Authority: 12 U.S.C. 378, 1464, 1813, 1815, 1817, 1818, 1819(a) (Seventh and Tenth),

substantially complete, the FDIC shall 
specify the additional information the 
applicant shall provide in order for the 
application to be considered 
substantially complete. If the FDIC fails 
to notify the applicant within 30 days 
after receiving an application, the 
application shall be deemed 
substantially complete as of the date it 
was received by the FDIC.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Authority for This Rulemaking 
The FAA’s authority to issue rules 
regarding aviation safety is found in 
Title 49 of the United States Code. 
Subtitle I, Section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. 
Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the 
agency’s authority. This rulemaking is 
promulgated under the authority 
described in Subtitle VII, Part A, 
Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that 
section, the FAA is charged with 
prescribing regulations to assign the use 
of airspace necessary to ensure the 
safety of aircraft and the efficient use of 
airspace. This regulation is within the 
scope of that authority as it would 
amend Class E airspace in Franklin, NC. 
Comments Invited 
The FAA invites interested persons to 
participate in this rulemaking by 
submitting written comments, data, or 
views. Comments are specifically 
invited on the overall regulatory, 
aeronautical, economic, environmental, 
and energy-related aspects of the 
proposal. The most helpful comments 
reference a specific portion of the 
proposal, explain the reason for any 
recommended change, and include 
supporting data. To ensure the docket 
does not contain duplicate comments, 
commenters should submit only one 
time if comments are filed 
electronically, or commenters should 
send only one copy of written 
comments if comments are filed in 
writing. 
The FAA will file in the docket all

Incorporation by Reference 
Class E airspace designations are 
published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA 
Order JO 7400.11, Airspace 
Designations and Reporting Points, 
which is incorporated by reference in 14 
CFR 71.1 on an annual basis. This 
document proposes to amend the 
current version of that order, FAA Order 
JO 7400.11K, Airspace Designations and 
Reporting Points, dated August 4, 2025, 
and effective September 15, 2025. These 
updates would be published in the next 
update to FAA Order JO 7400.11. FAA 
Order JO 7400.11K, which lists Class A, 
B, C, D, and E airspace areas, air traffic 
service routes, and reporting points, is 
publicly available as listed in the 
ADDRESSESsection of this document. 
The Proposal 
The FAA proposes an amendment to 
14 CFR part 71 to update Class E 
airspace by removing the point in space 
reference and updating the coordinates 
for Angel Medical Center in Franklin, 
NC. It would also update the legal 
description for Macon County Airport to 
reflect the most accurate and up-to-date 
coordinates. Controlled airspace is 
necessary for the safety and 
management of instrument flight rules 
(IFR) operations in the area. 
Regulatory Notices and Analyses 
The FAA has determined that this 
proposed regulation only involves an 
established body of technical 
regulations for which frequent and 
routine amendments are necessary to 
keep them operationally current. It, 
therefore, (1) is not a ‘‘significant 
regulatory action’’ under Executive 
Order 12866; (2) is not a ‘‘significant 
rule’’ under Department of 
Transportation (DOT) Regulatory 
Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; 
February 26, 1979); and (3) does not 
warrant preparation of a regulatory 
evaluation as the anticipated impact is 
so minimal. Since this is a routine 
matter that will only affect air traffic 
procedures and air navigation, it is 
certified that this proposed rule, when 
promulgated, will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities under the 
criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
Environmental Review 
This proposal will be subject to an 
environmental analysis in accordance 
with FAA Order 1050.1G, ‘‘FAA 
National Environmental Policy Act 
Implementing Procedures,’’ prior to any 
final regulatory action by the FAA.

Patuxent River, MD 
AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 
SUMMARY: This action proposes to amend Class D, Class E2, Class E4, and 
Class E5 airspace at Patuxent River 
Naval Air Station (NAS) (Trapnell 
Field), Patuxent River, MD. The 
currently designated Class D, Class E2,

operations, which require controlled 
airspace. The geographic coordinates for 
Patuxent River NAS (Trapnell Field) 
would be updated in the airspace legal 
descriptions. The reference to the 
decommissioned Patuxent VORTAC 
would also be updated in the Class E2, 
Class E4, and Class E5 airspace legal 
descriptions. Last, the geographic 
coordinates for the Patuxent River NDB 
would also be updated in the Class E2 
and Class E4 airspace legal descriptions. 
DATES: Comments must be received on or before February 2, 2026.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Authority for This Rulemaking 
The FAA’s authority to issue rules 
regarding aviation safety is found in 
Title 49 of the United States Code. 
Subtitle I, Section 106, describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. 
Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the 
agency’s authority. This rulemaking is 
promulgated under the authority 
described in Subtitle VII, Part A, 
Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that 
section, the FAA is charged with 
prescribing regulations to assign the use 
of airspace necessary to ensure the 
safety of aircraft and the efficient use of 
airspace. This regulation is within the 
scope of that authority as it would 
amend Class D, Class E2, Class E4, and 
Class E5 airspace in Patuxent River, MD. 
Comments Invited 
The FAA invites interested persons to 
participate in this rulemaking by 
submitting written comments, data, or 
views. Comments are specifically 
invited on the overall regulatory, 
aeronautical, economic, environmental, 
and energy-related aspects of the 
proposal. The most helpful comments

proposal, explain the reason for any 
recommended change, and include 
supporting data. To ensure the docket 
does not contain duplicate comments, 
commenters should submit only one 
time if comments are filed 
electronically, or commenters should 
send only one copy of written 
comments if comments are filed in 
writing. 
The FAA will file in the docket all 
comments it receives, as well as a report 
summarizing each substantive public 
contact with FAA personnel concerning 
this proposed rulemaking. Before acting 
on this proposal, the FAA will consider 
all comments it receives on or before the 
closing date for comments. The FAA 
will consider comments filed after the 
comment period has closed if it is 
possible to do so without incurring 
expense or delay. The FAA may change 
this proposal in light of the comments 
it receives. 
Privacy: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(c), DOT solicits comments from the 
public to better inform its rulemaking 
process. DOT posts these comments, 
without edits, including any personal 
information the commenter provides, to 
www.regulations.gov, as described in the system of records notice (DOT/ALL–

Incorporation by Reference 
Class D, Class E2, Class E4, and Class 
E5 airspace designations are published 
in paragraphs 5000, 6002, 6004, and 
6005 of FAA Order JO 7400.11, Airspace 
Designations and Reporting Points, 
which is incorporated by reference in 14 
CFR 71.1 on an annual basis. This 
document proposes to amend the 
current version of that order, FAA Order 
JO 7400.11K, dated August 4, 2025, and 
effective September 15, 2025. These 
updates would be published in the next 
update to FAA Order JO 7400.11. FAA 
Order JO 7400.11K, which lists Class A, 
B, C, D, and E airspace areas, air traffic 
service routes, and reporting points, is 
publicly available as listed in the 
ADDRESSESsection of this document. 
The Proposal 
This action proposes to amend 14 
CFR part 71 by modifying the Class D, 
Class E2, Class E4, and Class E5 airspace 
for Patuxent River NAS (Trapnell Field), 
Patuxent River, MD. Controlled airspace 
is necessary for the safety and 
management of IFR operations in the 
area for existing instrument approach 
procedures. 
This action proposes to amend the 
Class D airspace over Patuxent River, 
MD, by updating the Patuxent River 
NAS (Trapnell Field) geographic 
coordinates and increasing the lateral 
boundary of the Class D airspace to 
within a 4.7-mile radius of Patuxent 
River NAS (Trapnell Field) and within 
a .5-mile radius of Chesapeake Ranch 
Airpark excluding that airspace within 
Restricted Areas R–4005 and R–4007 
when active. The superseded reference 
to the ‘‘Airport Facility Directory’’ 
would also be replaced with ‘‘Chart 
Supplement’’ in the airspace legal 
description. 
This action also proposes to amend 
the Class E2 airspace over Patuxent 
River, MD, by updating the geographic 
coordinates of Patuxent River NAS 
(Trapnell Field) and modifying the 
dimensions from the current 
configuration to that airspace extending 
upward from the surface within a 4.7- 
mile radius of Patuxent River NAS 
(Trapnell Field) and within 1.8 miles 
each side of the 047° bearing from Patuxent River NAS extending from the 
4.7-mile radius of Patuxent River NAS 
to 6.5 miles northeast of the airport; and 
within 1.9 miles each side of the 233° 
bearing from Patuxent River NAS 
extending from the 4.7-mile radius to 
6.2 miles southwest of the airport; and 
within 1.8 miles each side of the 137° 
bearing from Patuxent River NAS

10.8 miles southeast of the airport; and 
within a .5-mile radius of Chesapeake 
Ranch Airpark, excluding that airspace 
within Restricted Areas R–4005 and R– 
4007 when active. This reconfiguration 
would properly contain the currently 
published standard instrument 
approach procedures. The reference to 
the decommissioned Patuxent VORTAC 
in the Class E2 legal description would 
also be removed, and the geographic 
coordinates of the Patuxent River NDB 
would be updated. 
This action also proposes to amend 
the Class E4 airspace over Patuxent 
River, MD, by updating the geographic 
coordinates of Patuxent River NAS 
(Trapnell Field) and modifying the 
dimensions from the current 
configuration to that airspace extending 
upward from the surface within 1.8 
miles each side of the 047° bearing from Patuxent River NAS extending from the 
4.7-mile radius of Patuxent River NAS 
to 6.5 miles northeast of the airport; and 
within 1.9 miles each side of the 233° 
bearing from Patuxent River NAS 
extending from the 4.7-mile radius to 
6.2 miles southwest of the airport; and 
within 1.8 miles each side of the 137° 
bearing from Patuxent River NAS 
extending from the 4.7-mile radius to 
10.8 miles southeast of the airport, 
excluding that airspace within 
Restricted Areas R–4005 and R–4007 
when active. This reconfiguration will 
properly contain the currently 
published standard instrument 
approach procedures. Additionally, the 
reference to the decommissioned 
Patuxent VORTAC in the Class E4 legal 
description would be removed; the 
superseded reference to the ‘‘Airport 
Facility Directory’’ would be replaced 
with ‘‘Chart Supplement’’; and the 
geographic coordinates of the Patuxent 
River NDB would be updated. 
Lastly, this action proposes to amend 
the Class E5 airspace over Patuxent 
River, MD, by replacing the reference to 
the decommissioned Patuxent VORTAC 
with point in space coordinates using 
the same geographic coordinates. 
Regulatory Notices and Analyses 
The FAA has determined that this 
proposed regulation only involves an 
established body of technical 
regulations for which frequent and 
routine amendments are necessary to 
keep them operationally current. It, 
therefore, (1) is not a ‘‘significant 
regulatory action’’ under Executive 
Order 12866; (2) is not a ‘‘significant 
rule’’ under Department of 
Transportation (DOT) Regulatory 
Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; 
February 26, 1979); and (3) does not 
warrant preparation of a regulatory 
evaluation as the anticipated impact is 
so minimal. Since this is a routine 
matter that will only affect air traffic 
procedures and air navigation, it is 
certified that this proposed rule, when 
promulgated, will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities under the 
criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
Environmental Review 
This proposal will be subject to an 
environmental analysis in accordance 
with FAA Order 1050.1G, ‘‘FAA 
National Environmental Policy Act 
Implementing Procedures’’ prior to any 
FAA final regulatory action.

2026. Due to a high concentration of 
expected spectator vessels and the series 
of events, the Coast Guard Northeast 
District Commander (CGD–NE) and the 
COTP, have determined these 
regulations are necessary for the safety 
of Sail 4th 250 participants, INR 250 
participants, spectator vessels, non- 
participant and non-spectator vessels 
operating in and around Port of New 
York and New Jersey, and life and 
property. 
While this rulemaking does not 
propose establishing any safety zones, it 
is important to note that after the Sail 
4th 250 Tall Ship Parade of Sail, INR 
250, IAR, and U.S. Navy Fleet Week 
events, we anticipate that numerous 
safety zones would be promulgated for 
fireworks displays occurring in the 
harbor through separate rulemaking 
projects or that safety zones would be 
enforced under our authorities in 33 
CFR 165.160—Table 1.

The Coast Guard is proposing this 
rulemaking under authorities in 33 
U.S.C. 2071; 46 U.S.C. 70006, 70034, 
70041, 70051, 70124; 33 CFR 1.05–1, 
6.04–1, 6.04–6, and 160.5; Department 
of Homeland Security Delegation No. 
00170.1, Revision No. 01.4. 
III. Discussion of the Rule 
Sail250

and INR 250 are 
international events that bring together 
tall ships and military vessels to 
celebrate the 250th anniversary of the 
United States. Sail 4th 250 comprises 
the Sail250

events in the Port of New 
York and New Jersey. Additional 
information about Sail 4th 250 can be 
found at https://sail4th.org/. INR 250, hosted by the U.S. Navy in the Port of 
New York and New Jersey concurrent 
with Sail 4th 250, will include a series 
of events to commemorate this historic 
occasion. Additional information about 
INR 250 can be found at https://
www.navy.mil/Navy-250/Events/. The regulations would be subject to 
enforcement upon the arrival of U.S. 
Naval Vessels, and foreign naval vessels 
at the Port of New York and New Jersey. 
These vessels would anchor in the 
Upper Bay and Hudson River on July 1, 
2026, prior to the Sail 4th 250 Tall Ship 
Parade of Sail, INR 250, IAR, and 
Independence Day fireworks displays 
within the regulated areas established 
within Port of New York and New Jersey 
on July 4, 2026. Participating tall ships, 
U.S. Naval Vessels, and foreign naval 
vessels will be mooring and anchoring 
in various areas throughout the Port of 
New York and New Jersey until their 
departure on July 9, 2026. 
The Sail 4th 250 Tall Ship Parade of 
Sail, INR 250, IAR, and the 
Independence Day fireworks displays 
are expected to be extraordinary marine 
events, celebrating maritime heritage 
and honoring the 250th anniversary of 
the founding of the United States. These 
events will offer unique opportunities to 
witness impressive parades and 
celebrations on the water. The Coast 
Guard typically establishes special local 
regulations and spectator areas to ensure 
safer viewing during marine events, and 
as discussed in this document, this 
event is no exception. The Coast Guard 
has collaborated with port partners, area 
stakeholders, Sail250

and the U.S. 
Navy, and numerous federal, state, and 
local agencies, as well as law 
enforcement organizations, to develop 
and propose regulations that will 
support a safe and secure event. 
However, it is worth mentioning, due to 
the scale of the event, its heightened 
security posture, the anticipated crowd 
size, and limited spectator areas, 
viewing the Sail 4th 250 Tall Ship 
Parade of Sail, the INR 250, the IAR, and 
Independence Day fireworks displays 
from shore may provide a safer and 
more convenient alternative, 
particularly for smaller vessels or less 
experienced mariners. 
Mariners transiting the regulated areas 
to and from spectator areas should use 
extra caution, ensure proper watch and 
assess all risk factors. Large marine 
events present new challenges to safe 
navigation, but proper voyage planning 
and access to relevant information 
should ensure that safety is not 
compromised. In general, mariners 
transiting within the Port of New York 
and New Jersey during this event should 
make a careful assessment of all factors 
associated with their voyage. 
These factors at a minimum should 
include: 
(1) The operator’s qualifications— 
which should include their level of 
experience, physical fitness, and 
alertness, ensuring they are well-rested 
and capable of safely operating the 
vessel. 
(2) The vessel’s characteristics— 
which should include the following: 
appropriate size to safely accommodate 
passengers and equipment, sufficient 
maneuverability to navigate the 
crowded waterway, and sea-keeping 
ability to handle expected water and 
weather conditions. The vessel must be 
capable of remaining in a designated 
spectator area for extended periods. The 
vessel should be equipped with 
required essential safety gear, including 
U.S. Coast Guard-approved life jackets, 
functioning navigation lights, fire 
extinguishers, and reliable 
communication devices. Additionally, 
the vessel should provide adequate 
protection from environmental 
elements, such as sun, wind, and rain. 
The propulsion, steering, fuel, and 
navigational equipment must be in 
excellent operational condition to 
ensure reliability and safety throughout 
the event. Furthermore, the vessel 
should have the ability to retain or 
manage its sewage in compliance with 
environmental regulations. 
(3) Weather conditions—both current 
and forecasted—should include an 
assessment of sea state, visibility, 
temperature, sun exposure, 
precipitation, and wind speed and 
direction. 
(4) Voyage planning should 
incorporate up-to-date information on 
the event schedule, including activities 
such as the Sail 4th 250 Tall Ship 
Parade of Sail, INR 250, IAR, and 
Independence Day fireworks displays, 
as well as the enforcement of 
regulations, such as designated 
spectator areas and security zones. 
Careful consideration should be given to 
whether the transit will occur during 
daytime or nighttime. Additional factors 
to account for include crowded 
waterways, wake and wave action, 
limited maneuvering space, anchoring 
challenges due to strong currents, water 
depth variations during tidal cycles, and 
prolonged exposure to environmental 
conditions including high temperatures 
and sun or cooler temperatures, rain, 
and wind. 
At the time of this notice, Sail 4th 250 
and the United States Navy events and 
a general overview of proposed 
regulations include: 
1. June 17, 2026–June 29, 2026: The 
United States Navy will commence 
installation of moorings for U.S. naval 
vessels that will be occupying Federal 
Anchorage FA–21B. 
2. July 1, 2026—Proposed Regulated 
Area ‘B’ will become effective as the 
United States Navy will commence 4- 
point mooring of vessels in FA–21B in 
the Upper Bay. A naval vessel 
protection zone
7
will be enforced 
around all U.S. Naval Vessels and a 100- 
yard security zone is proposed around

all foreign naval vessels. Upon 
anchoring, a security zone would be 
established around the vessels. Certain 
anchorage grounds in the Port of New 
York and New Jersey will be 
temporarily suspended; however, 
vessels seeking to anchor in an 
anchorage ground while it is 
temporarily suspended and not being 
used as a spectator area or staging area 
must request authorization from the 
U.S. Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Service 
New York (VTS). 
3. July 2, 2026—Class A tall ships will 
commence anchoring in the proposed 
Sandy Hook Bay staging area. Regulated 
Area ‘A’ is proposed to be effective as 
outlined below. The United States Navy 
will continue anchoring vessels in the 
Upper Bay and Hudson River each with 
a proposed security zone as discuss 
below. 
4. July 3, 2026—U.S. and foreign 
naval vessels continue to transit to their 
designated anchorages in the Upper Bay 
and Hudson River with proposed 
security zones as later discussed below. 
Established spectator areas would be 
effective and opened for viewing the 
Sail 4th 250 Tall Ship Parade of Sail, 
INR 250, and IAR that are scheduled for 
July 4, 2026, as below. 
5. July 4, 2026—The INR 250 will 
commence. It is anticipated to consist of 
a person under the protection of the 
United States Secret Service onboard a 
U.S. Naval Vessel transiting past all U.S. 
and foreign naval vessels anchored in 
the Hudson River and Upper Bay. The 
‘U.S. Naval Review Vessel’ will have a 
moving security zone as discussed 
below and will sail from north of the 
George Washington Bridge, south to the 
Verrazano Bridge reviewing the Navy 
fleet. Upon completion of the INR 250, 
the lead tall ship will commence the 
Sail 4th 250 Tall Ship Parade of Sail 
starting from the Verrazano Bridge to 
the vicinity of the George Washington 
Bridge. Upon arrival at the end of the 
parade route, each tall ship will then 
proceed to their assigned berth at 
various locations throughout the Port of 
New York and New Jersey. 
Simultaneously, the IAR will commence 
while the Sail 4th 250 Tall Ship Parade 
of Sail is occurring. At the conclusion 
of the Sail 4th 250 Tall Ship Parade of 
Sail, some naval vessels may weigh 
anchor and transit to berth at various 
locations in the Port of New York and 
New Jersey. In the evening, there will be 
multiple fireworks displays occurring 
throughout the Hudson River and East 
River. Safety zones and/or special local 
regulations for these events will be 
proposed and created under a separate 
rulemaking projects at a later date. 
6. July 5, 2026—Additional naval 
vessels will shift from anchorage to their 
berths located at various areas in Port of 
New York and New Jersey. There would 
still be U.S. and foreign naval vessels 
anchored in the Upper Bay and Hudson 
River. These vessels would still have a 
security zone around them in their 
anchored locations. 
7. July 6, 2026—INR 250 participant 
vessels will continue shifting to berths; 
however, some will remain at anchor at 
various locations throughout the Port of 
New York and New Jersey. 
8. July 7, 2026, through July 9, 2026— 
Tall ships, U.S. naval vessels, and 
foreign naval vessels depart the Port of 
New York and New Jersey. Enforcement 
periods for security zones would 
collapse as vessels depart. However, 
naval vessel protection zones as 
codified in 33 CFR 165.2025 or 
temporary security zones for foreign 
naval vessels created by this proposed 
regulation would remain in effect for 
vessels as they remain within the 
Captain of the Port New York Zone. 
Special Local Regulations—Background 
In 1976, 1986, and 2000, similar 
events, including OPSAIL 1976, 1986 
and 2000, drew several million 
spectators by land, as well as tens of 
thousands spectator vessels in Port of 
New York and New Jersey waters. 
An organized water event of limited 
duration which is conducted according 
to a prearranged schedule is a ‘‘Regatta 
or marine parade,’’ as defined at 33 CFR 
100.05.
8
An individual or organization 
planning to hold a regatta or marine 
parade which, by its nature, 
circumstances or location, will 
introduce extra or unusual hazards to 
the safety of life on the navigable waters 
of the U.S. must submit an application 
to hold it in accordance with 33 CFR 
100.15.
9
 
On June 1, 2025, the sponsors of the 
Sail 4th 250 and INR 250 events 
submitted applications under 33 CFR 
100.15 to conduct the Sail 4th 250 Tall 
Ship Parade of Sail and INR 250 on July 
4, 2026, with participating vessels 
mooring and anchoring in various 
berths and areas through the Port of 
New York and New Jersey, until their 
departure on July 9, 2026. 
Per 33 CFR 100.35, after approving 
plans for the holding of a regatta or 
marine parade within their district or 
zone, CGD–NE and the COTP are 
authorized to promulgate such special 
local regulations (SLRs) as they deem 
necessary to ensure safety of life on the 
navigable waters immediately prior to, 
during, and immediately after the 
approved regatta or marine parade. Due 
to the high-profile nature of these 
events, the large number of tall ships, 
naval vessels, spectator vessels, and 
support craft will certainly cause vessel 
congestion in the Port of New York and 
New Jersey. The COTP has determined 
that there will be potential hazards 
associated with the large number of tall 
ships and naval vessels and significant 
amount of recreational boating traffic. 
Thus, the Coast Guard proposes to 
establish SLRs that would create vessel 
movement control measures, spectator 
areas, and staging areas in the Port of 
New York and New Jersey that will be 
in effect during the entirety of the Sail 
4th 250 Tall Ship Parade of Sail and INR 
250 events celebrating America’s 250th 
anniversary. This section would be 
designated as section 100.T0199–0903. 
Special Local Regulation—The Two 
Regulated Areas 
The Coast Guard proposes 
establishing two regulated areas in the 
Port of New York and New Jersey that 
would be in effect from July 1, 2026, 
through July 9, 2026. These two 
proposed regulated areas are needed to 
protect the maritime public and 
participating vessels from possible 
hazards to navigation associated with an 
INR conducted on the Hudson River and 
New York Harbor Upper Bay, a Tall 
Ship Parade of Sail in the waters of 
Sandy Hook Bay, New York Harbor, 
Hudson River, and East River, and a 
large number of naval vessels, tall ships, 
and spectator craft anchored in close 
proximity throughout the duration of 
the events. These regulated areas 
include spectator areas, staging areas, 
and vessel operating restrictions. 
From 6 a.m. on July 4, 2026, through 
the conclusion of the Sail 4th 250 Tall 
Ship Parade of Sail, no vessel except 
Sail 4th 250 or INR 250 participating 
vessels and their assisting tugs and 
ticketed spectator vessels may enter or 
navigate within Regulated Areas ‘A’ or 
‘B’, unless specifically authorized by the 
COTP or their designated representative. 
Vessels operating on established 
schedules, such as ferries, may be 
granted authorization to transit the 
regulated areas. 
Any vessels transiting through Port 
New York and New Jersey would be 
required to proceed in accordance with 
established vessel movement control 
measures directed by the COTP or 
designated representative. 
Regulated Area ‘A’: All waters of New 
York Harbor Lower Bay and Sandy 
Hook Bay within the following

This proposed area is for the Sail 4th 
250 Tall Ship Parade of Sail, INR 250 
and totality of events that are occurring 
throughout the week. Swimming, 
conducting underwater diving 
operations, operating surface or 
underwater drones, and conducting 
surveying operations would be 
prohibited for the duration of these 
events, unless expressly permitted by 
the COTP or a designated 
representative. The heightened security 
posture within the Port of New York 
and New Jersey would continue until 
departure of the participating naval 
vessels and tall ships. The proposed 
regulated area would be effective from 
10 a.m. on July 1, 2026, until 11:59 p.m. 
on July 9, 2026. Additional regulations 
governing these areas can be found at 
the end of this document under

Special Local Regulation—Spectator 
Areas 
The Coast Guard proposes 
establishing nine temporary spectator 
areas during the Sail 4th 250 Tall Ship 
Parade of Sail, INR 250, and IAR from 
3 p.m. on July 3, 2026, through 8 a.m. 
on July 5, 2026. These temporary 
spectator areas would be established in 
the vicinity of Liberty Island, Caven 
Point, Jersey Flats, Robbins Reef, Bay 
Ridge, and South Beach, Staten Island. 
The proposed size and type of vessels 
that would be authorized in each 
spectator area is outlined in the 
regulatory text at the end of this 
document under 100.T0199–0903. 
It is currently anticipated that vessel 
operators seeking to attend in spectator 
areas will have the opportunity to 
obtain a ticket through procedures 
established by the Sail 4th 250 event 
sponsor, which will be announced at a 
later date. 
Following the completion of the Sail 
4th 250 Tall Ship Parade of Sail, vessel 
operators would be able to depart from 
their respective spectator areas as on- 
scene safety and security concerns 
allow. Transits to the south through the 
Narrows and to the west through the 
Kill van Kull may be allowed to depart 
significantly earlier than those transiting 
north through the East River and 
Hudson River. 
The locations of the proposed 
temporary spectator areas are shown in

Special Local Regulation—Staging 
Areas 
The Coast Guard is proposing to 
establish six staging areas for use by Sail 
4th 250 participant vessels and 
command vessels overseeing the Tall 
Ship Parade of Sail in the vicinity of 
Ellis Island, Governors Island, 
Gravesend Bay, and Sandy Hook Bay. 
The staging areas in the vicinity of 
Ellis Island and Governors Island are 
proposed to be established from 3 p.m. 
on July 3, 2026, through 8 a.m. on July 
5, 2026. The staging area in the vicinity 
of Gravesend Bay is proposed to be 
established from 1 p.m. on July 3, 2026, 
to 4 p.m. on July 4, 2026. The staging 
areas in the vicinity of Sandy Hook Bay 
are proposed to be established from 6 
a.m. on July 2, 2026, through 4 p.m. on 
July 4, 2026. 
No vessels other than Sail 4th 250 
participant vessels, command vessels, 
designated assist tugs, and enforcement 
vessels would be permitted to anchor, 
loiter, or approach within 100 yards of 
any Sail 4th 250 participant vessel when 
it is navigating or at anchor in these 
areas. 
The proposed locations of the 
temporary staging areas are shown in

Additionally, the Coast 
Guard proposes to establish nine fixed 
security zones to be enforced upon U.S. 
and foreign naval vessels anchored in 
the Port of New York and New Jersey. 
These security zones are proposed to 
protect U.S. and foreign naval vessels 
before, during, and after the Sail 4th 250

the naval fleet. 
Finally, the Coast Guard is proposing 
to establish a security zone for the 
‘‘Reviewing Official Viewing Platform’’. 
This security zone will include all 
waters from surface to bottom within a 
500-yard radius of the U.S. Naval Vessel 
anchored in the vicinity of Federal 
Anchorage 21–B and will be enforced 
from 8 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. on July 4, 
2026. 
The COTP would make notification of 
exact dates and times in advance of each 
enforcement period for each security 
zone to the local maritime community 
through the Local Notice to Mariners 
and Broadcast Notice to Mariners on 
VHF–FM Channel 16. 
Vessels seeking permission to transit 
security zones shall contact the COTP or 
designated representative on VHF–FM 
16 or (844) NYC–USCG.

https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-33/section- 
110.155. 
Temporary Suspension of Anchorages 
This proposal includes the temporary 
suspension of certain anchorage 
grounds within 33 CFR 110.155 (Port of 
New York)
12
through the temporary stay 
of their associated regulations governing 
their use, during the periods that the 
regulated areas, temporary spectator 
areas, staging areas, and security zones 
are temporarily in effect. The 
anchorages we propose to suspend are 
Anchorage No. 16, Anchorage No. 17, 
Anchorage No. 19 West, Anchorage No. 
20–A, Anchorage No. 20–B, Anchorage 
No. 20–C, Anchorage No. 20–D, 
Anchorage No. 20–E, Anchorage No. 
20–F, Anchorage No. 20–G, Anchorage 
No. 21–B, Anchorage No. 21–C, 
Anchorage No. 23–A, Anchorage No. 
23–B, Anchorage No. 24, Anchorage No. 
25, Anchorage No. 49–F, and Anchorage 
No. 49–G. The proposed rule would be 
effective July 1, 2026, through July 9, 
2026. However, vessels seeking to 
anchor in a traditional anchorage 
ground while it is temporarily 
suspended and not being used as a 
spectator area or staging area for the 
exclusive use of Sail 4th 250 and INR 
250 could request permission to do so. 
They would need to request 
authorization from the VTS via VHF– 
FM channel 14 or by telephone at (718) 
354–4088; see 33 CFR 110.155(d)(16) 
and (l) for additional permission to 
anchor guidance. All vessels granted 
permission to anchor would need to 
comply with lawful instructions of the 
VTS. 
IV. Regulatory Analyses 
We developed this proposed rule after 
considering numerous statutes and 
Executive Orders related to rulemaking. 
Below we summarize our analyses 
based on a number of these statutes and 
Executive Orders. 
A. Impact on Small Entities 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 
1980, 5 U.S.C. 601–612, as amended, 
requires Federal agencies to consider 
the potential impact of regulations on 
small entities during rulemaking. The 
term ‘‘small entities’’ comprises small 
businesses, not-for-profit organizations 
that are independently owned and 
operated and are not dominant in their 
fields, and governmental jurisdictions 
with populations of less than 50,000. 
The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 
605(b) that this proposed rule would not 
have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities 
for the following reasons. 
This regulation would temporarily 
suspend certain anchorage grounds, 
create spectator areas and staging areas, 
impose traffic control measures and 
security zones in portions of the Port of 
New York and New Jersey, and 
designate areas for viewing the Sail 4th 
250 Tall Ship Parade of Sail, INR 250, 
IAR, and U.S. Navy Fleet Week events, 
all of which would allow for maximum 
use of the waterway by commercial tour 
boats that usually operate in the area. 
However, while the traffic control 
measures are in place over a substantial 
portion of the Port of New York and 
New Jersey, vessel movements will only 
be restricted for a limited period of time 
during the aforementioned events. The 
suspension of temporary anchorage 
grounds and implementation of security 
zones will only be effective for up to 
nine days. Vessels seeking to anchor in 
a traditional anchorage ground while 
they are temporarily suspended and not 
being used as a spectator area or staging 
area for the exclusive use of the Sail 4th 
250 Tall Ship Parade of Sail and the INR 
250 could request authorization from 
the from the VTS. While the security 
zones are effective for the entire nine 
days and consume a major portion of 
the Hudson River, they will not be 
enforced for the entire period and will 
allow for vessel traffic to proceed 
through the federal channel as normal 
for most of those nine days. As the U.S. 
Naval Vessels vacate each zone to 
proceed to berth after the events on July 
4, 2026, the enforcement of these 
temporary security zones might be 
suspended. Selected vessels, such as 
ferries operating on established routes 
may have the opportunity to continue to 
transit through zones with permission 
from the COTP or designated 
representative. The Coast Guard will 
establish a process for vetting these 
certain vessels and the public will be 
notified at a later date. Over the past six 
months, Sail 4th 250 and the U.S. Navy 
have held multiple meetings open to 
port stakeholders discussing these 
events on July 4, 2026, and during each 
meeting, varying degrees of waterway 
impacts have been discussed, including 
those similar to what is proposed in this 
NPRM. An extensive advance notice 
will be made to mariners via 
appropriate means, which may include 
broadcast notice to mariners, local 
notice to mariners, marine safety 
information bulletins, local port 
operators group meetings, Harbor Safety 
Committee meetings, the internet, 
handouts, or local newspapers and 
media. The advance notice will permit 
mariners to adjust their plans 
accordingly. Similar restrictions were 
established for other tall ship parades 
and INR events in 1976, 1986, and 2000. 
Based upon the Coast Guard’s 
experiences from those previous events 
of similar magnitude and considering 
this is the first such event in the Port of 
New York and New Jersey since the 
attacks of September 11, 2001, these 
proposed regulations have been 
narrowly tailored to impose the least 
impact on maritime interests while 
providing the necessary level of safety 
and security. 
If you think that your business, 
organization, or governmental 
jurisdiction qualifies as a small entity 
and that this proposed rule would have 
a significant economic impact on it, 
please submit a comment (see 
ADDRESSES) explaining why you think it 
qualifies and how and to what degree 
this proposed rule would economically 
affect it. 
Under section 213(a) of the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104–121), 
if this proposed rule will affect your 
small business, organization, or 
governmental jurisdiction and you have 
questions, contact the person listed in 
the 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 
section. Small businesses may send 
comments to the Small Business and 
Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement 
Ombudsman and the Regional Small 
Business Regulatory Fairness Boards by 
calling 1–888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734– 
3247). 
B. Collection of Information 
This proposed rule will not call for a 
new collection of information under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3501–3520). 
C. Federalism and Indian Tribal 
Governments 
We have analyzed this proposed rule 
under Executive Order 13132, 
Federalism, and have determined that it 
is consistent with the fundamental 
federalism principles and preemption 
requirements described in that Order. 
Also, this proposed rule does not have 
tribal implications under Executive 
Order 13175, Consultation and 
Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments, because it does not have 
a substantial direct effect on one or 
more Indian tribes, on the relationship 
between the Federal Government and 
Indian tribes, or on the distribution of 
power and responsibilities between the 
Federal Government and Indian tribes. 
D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
As required by The Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 
1531–1538), the Coast Guard certifies

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with PROPOSALS159434 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Proposed Rules that this proposed rule will not result in 
an annual expenditure of $100,000,000 
or more (adjusted for inflation) by a 
State, local, or tribal government, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector. 
E. Environment 
We have analyzed this proposed rule 
under Department of Homeland 
Security Directive 023–01, Rev. 1, 
associated implementing instructions, 
and Environmental Planning 
COMDTINST 5090.1 (series), which 
guide the Coast Guard in complying 
with the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321–4370f), and 
have determined that this action is one 
of a category of actions that do not 
individually or cumulatively have a 
significant effect on the human 
environment. 
This proposed rule involves 
temporarily suspending permanent 
anchorages, proposing temporary 
spectator areas, and establishing 
temporary security zones and vessel 
traffic control measures to facilitate the 
safety of all spectator and participant 
vessels in the Sail 4th 250 Tall Ship 
Parade of Sail, INR 250, and IAR events. 
It is categorically excluded from further 
review under paragraphs L59(b), L60(a), 
and L61. 
V. Public Participation and Request for 
Comments 
We view public participation as 
essential to effective rulemaking and 
will consider all comments and material 
received during the comment period.

Mariners are cautioned that the areas 
designated as spectator areas in this section 
have not been subject to any special survey 
or inspection and that charts may not show 
all seabed obstructions or the shallowest 
depths. In addition, if you decide to anchor, 
spectator areas are in areas of substantial 
currents, and not all spectator areas are over 
good holding ground. Mariners are advised to 
take appropriate precautions when using 
these temporary spectator areas. 
Note to § 100.T0199–0903: Untreated 
sewage discharges are prohibited within 
three miles from shore. Section 312 of the 
Clean Water Act requires the use of operable, 
U.S. Coast Guard-certified marine sanitation 
devices onboard vessels that are equipped 
with installed toilets and operating on U.S. 
navigable waters. Additionally, parts of the 
Hudson River located in EPA Region 02 are 
No-Discharge Zones. No-Discharge Zones 
prohibit the discharge of sewage from vessels 
to protect water quality. Mariners are warned 
they cannot discharge any treated or 
untreated sewage within a No-Discharge 
Zone and must instead retain it on board and 
use onshore pump-out facilities to dispose of 
it later. Additional information on 
commercial pump-out vessels or the location 
of onshore pump-out facilities dedicated to 
the collection and legal disposal of marine 
sewage may be found at https://

(the Act) authorizes Federal grants to 
the States for Medicaid programs to

Section 1902(a)(19) of the Act states that a State 
plan for medical assistance must ‘‘provide such 
safeguards as may be necessary to assure that 
eligibility for care and services under the plan will 
be determined, and such care and services will be 
provided, in a manner consistent with simplicity of 
administration and the best interests of the 
recipients.’’ 
3
Section 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act states that a 
State plan for medical assistance must ‘‘provide 
such methods and procedures relating to the 
utilization of, and the payment for, care and 
services available under the plan (including but not 
limited to utilization review plans as provided for 
in section 1903(i)(4) of the Act) as may be necessary 
to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such 
care and services and to assure that payments are 
consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of 
care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers 
so that care and services are available under the 
plan at least to the extent that such care and 
services are available to the general population in 
the geographic area.’’ 
provide medical assistance to persons 
with limited income and resources and 
title XXI of the Act authorizes Federal 
grants to States to provide child health 
assistance to targeted low-income 
children under age 19 through a 
separate CHIP, a Medicaid-expansion 
program, or a combination of the two. 
Separate CHIPs are programs under 
which a State receives Federal funding 
from its title XXI allotment to provide 
child health assistance through coverage 
that meets the requirements of section 
2103 of the Act and 42 CFR 457.402. For 
the purposes of this proposed rule, the 
term CHIP is used to refer to separate 
CHIPs. Medicaid and CHIP programs are 
administered primarily by the States, 
subject to Federal oversight and 
approval. Each State establishes its own 
Medicaid and CHIP eligibility 
standards, benefits packages, and 
payment rates in accordance with (and 
subject to) Federal statutory and 
regulatory requirements. If States 
comply with requirements in the 
Federal Medicaid and CHIP statutes and 
regulations (such as reflected in the 
provisions of their Federally-approved 
State plans), the Federal Government 
will match their expenditures with 
Federal funds. Each State Medicaid 
program and CHIP must be described 
and administered in accordance with a 
Federally approved State plan. This 
comprehensive document describes the 
nature and scope of the States’ Medicaid 
program and CHIP and provides 
assurances that they will be 
administered in conformity with 
applicable Federal requirements. 
Under title XIX, the Federal 
Government makes matching payments 
to States for medical assistance 
expenditures according to the formula 
described in sections 1903 and 1905(b) 
of the Act. Under title XXI, the Federal 
Government makes matching payments 
to States for child health assistance at 
the enhanced Federal medical 
assistance percentage (FMAP) 
established under section 2105 of the 
Act. Section 1903 of the Act requires 
that the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services (the Secretary) (except as 
otherwise provided) pay to each State 
which has a plan approved under title 
XIX of the Act, for each quarter, an 
amount equal to the FMAP of the total 
amount expended by the State during 
such quarter as medical assistance 
under the State plan. Section 1905(b) of 
the Act defines the FMAP. For CHIP, 
section 2105 requires the Secretary to 
pay each State with an approved plan 
under title XXI of the Act, for each 
quarter, an amount equal to the 
enhanced FMAP of expenditures in the 
quarter, paid from the State allotment. 
The enhanced FMAP, as defined at 
section 2105(b), for a State for a fiscal 
year, is equal to the FMAP (as defined 
in the first sentence of section 1905(b)) 
for the State increased by a number of 
percentage points equal to 30 percent of 
the number of percentage points by 
which (1) such FMAP for the State is 
less than (2) 100 percent; but in no case 
shall the enhanced FMAP for a State 
exceed 85 percent. 
As relevant to this proposed rule, 
among the statutory requirements for 
Medicaid State plans, section 
1902(a)(19) of the Act
2
requires that a 
State plan for medical assistance 
provide such safeguards as may be 
necessary to assure that care and 
services under the plan will be provided 
in a manner consistent with the best 
interests of the recipients. Furthermore, 
under section 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act,
3
 
the State plan must provide such 
methods and procedures relating to 
payment for care and services as may be 
necessary to assure that payments are 
consistent with quality of care. Among 
the statutory requirements for CHIP 
State plans, under section 2101(a) of the 
Act, funds are provided to States to 
provide health care services to 
uninsured, low-income children in an 
effective and efficient manner that is 
coordinated with other sources of health 
benefits coverage for children. 
Section 1102 of the Act requires the 
Secretary to make and publish such 
rules and regulations, not inconsistent 
with the Act, as may be necessary for 
the efficient administration of the 
functions with which the Secretary is 
charged under the Act. In Medicaid, 
these Secretarial functions would 
include oversight of Medicaid State 
programs for consistency with the 
requirements of sections 1902(a)(19) and 
1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act. In CHIP, these 
Secretarial functions would include 
oversight of CHIP under section 2101(a), 
which calls for effective and efficient 
administration of CHIP and 
coordination with other health care 
programs, including Medicaid, and 
under section 2107(e) of the Act, 
carrying out the functions required by 
the Medicaid provisions that apply to 
title XXI in the same manner as they 
apply under title XIX. 
On January 28, 2025, President Trump 
issued Executive Order (E.O.) 14187, 
Protecting Children from Chemical and 
Surgical Mutilation (E.O. 14187). 
Section 5(a) of that order directs the 
Secretary to take all appropriate actions 
consistent with applicable law to end 
what the order refers to as the chemical 
and surgical mutilation of children, 
including regulatory and sub-regulatory 
actions for specific programs, including 
Medicaid. The Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services (CMS) is aware that 
the U.S. District Court for the Western 
District of Washington has issued a 
preliminary injunction that enjoins 
defendant agencies from enforcing or 
implementing section 4 of E.O. 14187 
within the plaintiff States, as well as 
sections 3(e) or 3(g) of E.O. 14168, 
Defending Women From Gender 
Ideology Extremism and Restoring 
Biological Truth to the Federal 
Government (E.O. 14168), to condition 
or withhold Federal funding based on 
the fact that a health care entity or 
health professional provides ‘‘gender- 
affirming care’’ within the plaintiff 
States. Washington v. Trump, 768 F. Supp. 3d 1239, 1282 (W.D. Wash. 2025). 
In addition, the U.S. District Court for 
the District of Maryland has issued a 
preliminary injunction that enjoins the 
Federal defendants in that case from 
conditioning, withholding, or 
terminating Federal funding under 
section 3(g) of E.O. 14168 and section 4 
of E.O. 14187, based on the fact that a 
healthcare entity or health professional 
provides ‘‘gender-affirming care’’ to a 
patient under the age of 19 and required 
that written notice of this order be given 
to the aforementioned groups that 
Defendants may not take any steps to 
implement, give effect to, or reinstate 
under a different name the directives in 
section 3(g) of E.O. 14168 or section 4 
of E.O. 14187 that condition or withhold 
Federal funding based on the fact that 
a healthcare entity or health 
professional provides ‘‘gender-affirming 
medical care’’ to a patient under the age 
of 19. PFLAG, Inc. v. Trump, 769 F. Supp. 3d 405, 455 (D. Md. 2025). We 
note that if this proposed rule were to 
be finalized, it would not conflict with 
those preliminary injunctions because, 
among other things, it would be based

on independent legal authority and 
section 5(a) of E.O. 14187 and not the

As further discussed later in this 
proposed rule, we propose to implement 
sections 1902(a)(19) and 1902(a)(30)(A) 
of the Act by adding a new subpart N 
to 42 CFR part 441 to prohibit the use 
of Federal Medicaid dollars to fund sex- 
rejecting procedures, as defined in this 
proposed rule, for individuals under the 
age of 18. In addition, we propose to 
implement section 2103 of the Act by 
revising subpart D of part 457 of the Act 
to prohibit the use of Federal CHIP 
dollars to fund sex-rejecting procedures, 
as defined in this proposed rule, for 
individuals under the age of 19. These 
proposed changes would not prevent 
States from providing coverage for sex- 
rejecting procedures with State-only 
funds outside of the Federally-matched 
Medicaid program or CHIP. 
A. The Rise of Sex-Rejecting Procedures 
for Treatment of Gender Dysphoria in 
Minors 
Over the past decade, increasing 
numbers of children and adolescents 
have been diagnosed with gender 
dysphoria. The recorded prevalence of 
gender dysphoria/incongruence 
increased substantially in children and 
young people between 2011 and 2021, 
particularly in recorded females. Levels 
of anxiety, depression and self-harm 
were high, indicating an urgent need for 
better prevention and treatment of 
mental health difficulties in these 
patients [with gender dysphoria].
4
 
Similar research in Germany showed 
increasing rates in the diagnosis of 
gender incongruence.
5
Additionally, 
research in England explained that 
‘‘[r]ecent increases in incidence of 
gender dysphoria/incongruence have a 
range of potential explanations, 
including social factors (for example, 
. . . increasing use of social media and 
networking); increasing rates of 
emotional distress and poor mental 
health in this age group, particularly for 
females; and changes in supply and 
delivery of healthcare.’’
6
The number of 
children receiving medical 
interventions for gender dysphoria rose 
significantly following the publication 
of the ‘‘Dutch Protocol’’ in an article in 
the European Journal of Endocrinology in 2006.7
Over the past decade, 
increasing numbers of children have 
received diagnoses of gender dysphoria 
and received sex-rejecting procedures as 
recommended by the World 
Professional Association for 
Transgender Health (WPATH) and the 
Endocrine Society (ES).
89
The WPATH 
Standards of Care for the Health of 
Transgender and Gender Diverse 
People, Version 8 (SOC–8) noted that 
the creation of a chapter on adolescents 
was due in part to the ‘‘exponential 
growth in adolescent referral rates.’’
10
 
Surveys measuring ‘‘transgender’’ 
identity find prevalence of 1.2 percent 
among adolescents and ‘‘gender 
diverse’’ identities as high as 9 
percent.
11
WPATH also noted that 
female adolescents were seeking such 
procedures at twice to seven times the 
rate of males.
12
 
Included in SOC–8 is the 
recommendation that care providers 
‘‘undertake a comprehensive 
biopsychosocial assessment of 
adolescents’’ who seek medical 
transition
13
and ‘‘involve relevant 
disciplines, including mental health and 
medical professionals,’’ as well as 
parents, ‘‘unless their involvement is 
determined to be harmful.’’
14
 
The number of pediatric patients 
seeking sex-rejecting procedures can 
only be roughly estimated. In recent 
years, ‘‘the United States—characterized 
by its decentralized and privatized 
healthcare system—saw the emergence 
of many new specialty gender clinics, 
along with a proliferation of 
independently practicing clinicians. 
According to a recent conservative 
estimate, as of March 2023 there were 
271 clinics offering [pediatric medical 
transition] in the U.S., though 70 were 
inactive due to legislative 
restrictions.’’
15
 
An approach for gender dysphoria, 
referred to in this proposed rule as sex- 
rejecting procedures,
16
can involve the 
use of puberty suppressing drugs to 
prevent the onset of puberty; cross-sex 
hormones to spur the secondary sex 
characteristics of the opposite sex; and

rare cases) vaginoplasty. ‘‘Thousands of 
American children and adolescents 
have received these interventions.’’

A study published in 2023 estimated 
that between 2016 and 2020, nearly 
3,700 children between the ages of 12 
and 18 diagnosed with gender 
dysphoria underwent surgical 
procedures, including over 3,200 
children who had breast or chest 
surgery, and over 400 children who had 
genital surgery.

Another analysis 
found that between 2017 and 2021, 
more than 120,000 children ages 6 to 17 
were diagnosed with gender dysphoria 
and, of that group, more than 4,700 
started taking puberty blockers and 
more than 14,000 started hormonal 
therapy.

B. Medical Evidence Regarding Sex- 
Rejecting Procedures for Minors 
The existing guidelines to support the 
care of children and adolescents 
experiencing gender dysphoria around 
the world vary in their methodological 
rigor and quality. 
On May 1, 2025, the United States 
Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS) released a 
comprehensive review of the evidence 
and best practices for promoting the 
health of children and adolescents 
diagnosed with gender dysphoria.
20
On 
November 19, 2025, HHS published a 
final version of the review following 
conclusion of the peer review process 
(HHS Review).
21
The HHS Review, 
informed by an evidence-based 
medicine approach, indicated serious 
concerns about outcomes associated 
with certain medical interventions, such 
as puberty blockers, cross-sex 
hormones, and surgeries, that attempt to 
transition children and adolescents 
away from their sex.
22
The HHS Review 
highlights evidence pointing to 
significant risks associated with the use 
of these procedures, including 
irreversible harms such as infertility, 
and finds extremely weak evidence of 
benefit. Significantly, the HHS Review 
finds that the evidence base does not 
support conclusions about the 
effectiveness of medical and surgical 
interventions in improving mental 
health or reducing gender dysphoria 
symptoms, stating that ‘‘[a]nalysis of the 
biological plausibility of harms is 
necessary, and suggests that some short- 
and long-term harms are likely (in some 
cases expected) sequalae of 
treatment.’’
23
Likewise, the data 
considered in the HHS Review indicate 
that the risk/benefit profile of medical 
and surgical interventions for children 
and adolescents diagnosed with gender 
dysphoria is unfavorable. While the 
HHS Review itself does not make 
clinical, policy, or legislative 
recommendations, it provides critical 
insights that should inform 
policymakers as they make decisions to 
promote health and safety, especially for 
vulnerable populations such as minors. 
Specifically, the HHS Review 
conducted an overview of systematic 
reviews—also known as an ‘‘umbrella 
review’’—to evaluate the evidence 
regarding the benefits and harms of 
hormonal and surgical interventions for 
children and adolescents diagnosed 
with gender dysphoria. Existing 
systematic reviews of evidence, 
including several that have informed 
health authorities in Europe, were 
assessed for methodological quality. The 
umbrella review found that the overall 
quality of evidence concerning the 
effects of sex-rejecting procedures on 
psychological outcomes, quality of life, 
regret, or long-term health, is very low. 
Although the HHS Review 
acknowledges that systematic reviews 
offer limited evidence regarding the 
harms of sex-rejecting procedures in 
minors, it also provides plausible 
explanations for why evidence of harms 
may not have been sought, detected or 
reported. This may be due to several 
factors: the relatively recent adoption of 
hormonal and surgical treatment 
approaches, shortcomings in existing 
studies in consistently monitoring and 
reporting adverse effects, and 
publication bias. Even in the absence of 
strong evidence from large-scale 
population studies, the HHS Review 
notes, based on what is known about 
human physiology and the effects and 
mechanisms of the pharmacological 
agents used, there are known and 
plausible risks of significant harms from 
puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, 
and surgeries. These include 
‘‘infertility/sterility, sexual dysfunction, 
impaired bone density accrual, adverse 
cognitive impacts, cardiovascular 
disease and metabolic disorders, 
psychiatric disorders, surgical 
complications, and regret.’’
24
 
The HHS Review documents the weak 
evidence and growing international 
retreat from the use of puberty blockers, 
cross-sex hormones, and surgeries to 
treat gender dysphoria in minors
25
and 
the ‘‘risk of significant harms.’’
26
The 
HHS Review explains that ‘‘many 
treatments (e.g. surgery, hormone therapy) can lead to relatively common 
and potentially serious long-term 
adverse effects.’’
27
The HHS Review 
includes a methodologically rigorous 
assessment of evidence underpinning 
the use of surgical or endocrine 
interventions, including puberty 
blockers and cross-sex hormones, while 
also drawing on international practice 
evaluations such as the United 
Kingdom’s Cass Review, described in 
more detail below. The HHS Review 
documents serious concerns regarding 
the lack of reliable evidence of benefits, 
and risks of significant harms for this 
model of care that have mounted in 
recent years, and points to 
psychotherapy (talk therapy) as a 
noninvasive alternative. The HHS 
Review makes clear that ‘‘the evidence 
for benefit of pediatric medical 
transition is very uncertain, while the 
evidence for harm is less uncertain.’’
28
 
The HHS Review cites widely accepted 
principles of medical ethics to conclude 
that when ‘‘medical interventions pose 
unnecessary, disproportionate risks of 
harm, healthcare providers should 
refuse to offer them even when they are 
preferred, requested, or demanded by 
patients.’’
29
 
We are aware that approximately 17 
State Medicaid programs cover sex- 
rejecting procedures for children, citing 
guidelines from several major U.S. 
medical professional associations 
(American Medical Association, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, and 
the American Psychological 
Association) who have issued 
statements deeming sex-rejecting 
procedures, which they refer to as 
‘‘gender-affirming care,’’ safe and 
effective.
30 31 32 33
These medical society 
endorsements further supported 
adoption of sex-rejecting procedures by 
clinicians across the U.S. The HHS 
Review explains why such guidelines, 
including the WPATH Standards of Care

Gender Diverse People, Version 8 (SOC– 
8), are not trustworthy according to 
accepted standards for evaluating 
guideline quality. As the HHS Review 
documents in detail, the creation of 
SOC–8 marked a ‘‘clear departure from 
the principles of unbiased, evidence- 
driven clinical guideline 
development.’’
34
In the context of 
developing its recommendations, 
WPATH suppressed systematic reviews 
of evidence, failed to manage conflicts 
of interest, and relied on legal and 
political considerations rather than 
clinical ones.
35
A recent systematic 
review of international guideline quality 
concluded that ‘‘[h]ealthcare 
professionals should consider the lack 
of quality and independence of 
available guidance when utilizing this 
[WPATH and Endocrine Society 
international guidelines] for 
practice.’’
36
 
1. European Approaches for the 
Treatment of Pediatric Gender 
Dysphoria 
The HHS Review’s current findings 
are aligned with conclusions reached by 
multiple European countries. Sweden, 
Finland, and the United Kingdom 
conducted independent systematic 
reviews of evidence commissioned by 
their public health authorities. ‘‘All 
three concluded that the risks of 
medicalization
37
may outweigh the 
benefits for children and adolescents 
with gender dysphoria at the population 
level, and subsequently sharply 
restricted access to medical gender 
transition interventions for minors.’’
38
 
These three countries now recommend 
exploratory psychotherapy as the first 
line of treatment. Sweden and Finland 
reserve hormonal interventions only for 
exceptional cases, recognizing their 
experimental status.
39 40 41
 
In particular, the most influential 
effort to date has been the United 
Kingdom’s Cass Review—a 4-year 
independent evaluation of pediatric 
gender medicine that was published in 
April 2024.
42
The findings of the Cass 
Review led to the closure of the United 
Kingdom’s Gender Identity 
Development Service (GIDS), which had 
been given a rating of ‘‘inadequate’’ by 
the Care Quality Commission in 2021. 
The Cass Review recommended a 
restructuring of the care delivery 
model—away from the centralized 
‘‘gender clinic’’ model of care toward a 
more holistic framework centering on 
psychosocial support, to be delivered 
through regional hubs. The Cass 
Review’s findings also led the United 
Kingdom to ban the use of puberty 
blockers outside of clinical trials, and to 
significantly restrict cross-sex 
hormones. While cross-sex hormones 
are still officially an available treatment, 
the National Health Service (NHS) 
recently revealed that since the Cass 
Review was published, no minor has 
been found eligible to receive cross-sex 
hormones according to the updated 
policy. In the United Kingdom, minors 
have never received gender dysphoria- 
related surgery through the NHS. 
In 2022, Sweden’s National Board of 
Health and Welfare (NBHW) reviewed 
and updated its guidelines for minors 
under the age of 18. Sweden’s NBHW 
determined that the risks of puberty 
suppressing treatment with GnRH- 
analogues (injectable drugs that prevent 
the ovaries and testicles from producing 
sex hormones) and gender-affirming 
hormonal treatment likely outweigh the 
possible benefits.
43
Specifically, 
Sweden’s NBHW outlined that the first 
line of treatment should be mental 
health support and exploratory 
psychological care. Hormonal 
interventions can be a last resort 
measure for some youth. Sweden has 
made the decision to no longer offer 
gender transition [sex-rejecting 
procedures] to minors outside of 
research settings, and restricted 
eligibility to the early childhood-onset 
of gender dysphoria. 
In 2020, Finland’s Council for Choices 
in Health Care, a monitoring agency for 
the country’s public health services, 
issued guidelines that called for 
psychosocial support as the first line 
treatment, hormone therapy on a case- 
by-case basis after careful consideration, 
and no surgical treatment for minors. 
Finland has restricted eligibility for 
hormone therapy to minors with early 
childhood-onset of gender dysphoria 
and no mental health comorbidities.
44
 
In Denmark, more than 1300 minors 
with gender incongruence were 
‘‘referred to the national service 
between 2016 and 2022 with increasing 
referral numbers over time,’’ of which 
females constituted 70 percent.

increase in the number of referrals for 
these procedures and reports of regret or 
reversal of hormone-induced changes to 
the body led Denmark to take an 
approach that focuses on assessment 
and psychosocial support for minors, 
and postpones decisions on hormone 
therapy, including puberty blockers and 
cross-sex hormones, in circumstances 
‘‘when gender incongruence has been 
brief,’’ such as ‘‘when there are concerns 
about the stability of the experienced 
gender identity.’’
46
 
In Norway, the Norwegian 
Commission for the Investigation of 
Health Care Services (UKOM), an 
independent State-owned agency, made 
recommendations in 2023 on the 
treatment offered to children and young 
people with gender incongruence.
47
The 
recommendations consisted of: defining 
puberty blockers and surgical treatment 
for children as experimental, revising 
national guidelines based on a 
systematic knowledge summary, and 
consideration for a national registry to 
improve quality and reduce variation in 
patient treatment. Norway’s public 
health authority has signaled an 
intention to respond to UKOM’s 
concerns by considering whether the 
current treatment guidelines need to be 
adjusted.
48
 
Other countries which have restricted 
various approaches to treatment for 
minors (or have contemplated 
restrictions) include: New Zealand,
49
 
Italy,
50
Brazil,
51
and Australia.
52
 
In sum, there is growing international 
concern about the use of hormonal and 
surgical interventions for pediatric 
gender dysphoria. We are aware that 
some medical associations have 
endorsed sex-rejecting procedures, but 
as the HHS Review makes clear, their 
endorsement is not based on sound 
principles of evidence-based medicine. 
In addition to other issues, we solicit 
comment of any published findings that 
measure the effects of similar 
restrictions as proposed on insurers, 
providers, and patients in these 
countries. 
2. Medical Professional Societies 
Supporting Sex-Rejecting Procedures 
We are aware that numerous 
organizations
53
(including the 
American Medical Association 
(AMA),
54
the American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP),
55
and the American 
Psychological Association
56 57
) have 
issued statements supporting access to 
sex-rejecting procedures, including for 
minors. The most influential sources of 
clinical guidance for treating pediatric 
gender dysphoria in the U.S. are the 
WPATH and the ES clinical practice 
guidelines and the AAP guidance 
document. We reviewed each of these 
documents and agree with the 
conclusions of a recent systematic 
review of international guideline quality 
by researchers at the University of York 
(the York appraisal) that found all three 
documents as very low quality and 
should not be implemented.
58
 
As the HHS Review notes regarding 
the role of medical organizations in the 
treatment of pediatric gender medicine: 
U.S. medical associations played a 
key role in creating a perception that 
there is professional consensus in 
support of pediatric medical transition 
(PMT). This apparent consensus, 
however, is driven primarily by a small 
number of specialized committees, 
influenced by WPATH. It is not clear 
that the official views of these 
associations are shared by the wider 
medical community, or even by most of 
their members. There is evidence that 
some medical and mental health 
associations have suppressed dissent 
and stifled debate about this issue 
among their members.
59
 
The Endocrine Society (ES) issued 
clinical practice guidelines in 2017 
entitled ‘‘Endocrine Treatment of 
Gender-Dysphoric/Gender-Incongruent 
Persons.’’
60
As the HHS Review notes: 
In WPATH and ES guidelines, the 
principal goal of CSH administration 
[cross sex hormone] is to induce 
physical characteristics typical of the 
opposite sex. When hormone levels rise 
beyond the typical reference range for a 
person’s sex, they are considered 
supraphysiologic. ES guidelines suggest 
that the sex an individual identifies as— 
as opposed to their biological sex— 
should determine the target reference 
range for hormonal concentrations. 
Critics have argued that perceived 
identity does not alter physiological 
processes and that such a belief can 
result in inappropriate and potentially 
dangerous hormone dosing.
61
 
The HHS Review states: 
The ES 2017 guideline, which used 
the GRADE [Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, 
Development and Evaluation] 
framework, has been criticized for 
making strong recommendations for 
hormonal interventions in the setting of 
a weak evidence base. Notably, none of 
the systematic reviews that supported 
the ES guidelines were based on 
outcomes for children or adolescents. 
The ES recommendation to initiate 
puberty blockade using gonadotropin- 
releasing hormone agonists was derived 
by putting a higher value on achieving 
a ‘‘satisfactory physical appearance’’ 
while putting the lowest value on 
avoiding physical harms. The ES 
recommendation for the initiation of 
cross-sex hormones no earlier than age 
16 was justified by placing a higher 
value on adolescent’s purported ability 
to meaningfully consent to cross-sex 
hormones (CSH) and placing a lower

As explained in Chapter 9 of HHS 
Review, the guidelines issued by the 
World Professional Association for 
Transgender Health (WPATH) ‘‘have 
been rated among the lowest in quality 
and have not been recommended for 
implementation by systematic reviews 
(SRs) of guidelines.’’
63
As the HHS 
Review points out: ‘‘Despite their lack of 
trustworthiness, for more than a decade 
WPATH guidelines have served as the 
foundation of the healthcare 
infrastructure for gender dysphoric (GD) 
youth in the United States. The WPATH 
Standards of Care guidelines are 
embedded in nearly all aspects of 
healthcare including clinical education, 
delivery of care, and reimbursement 
decisions by private and public 
insurers.’’
64
In 2022, WPATH issued 
guidelines entitled ‘‘Standards of Care 
for the Health of Transgender and 
Gender Diverse People, Version 8’’ 
(SOC–8).
65
These guidelines relaxed 
eligibility criteria for children to access 
sex-rejecting procedures, and ultimately 
recommend that adolescents wishing to 
undergo sex-rejecting procedures 
receive them. Besides the problems 
identified in systematic reviews of 
international guidelines, as the HHS 
Review states, ‘‘in the process of 
developing SOC–8, WPATH suppressed 
systematic reviews its leaders believed 
would undermine its favored treatment 
approach. SOC–8 developers also 
violated conflict of interest management 
requirements and eliminated nearly all 
recommended age minimums for 
medical and surgical interventions in 
response to political pressures.’’
66
 
The HHS Review goes on to explain: 
‘‘The recommendations are couched in 
cautious-sounding language, stating that 
GD should be ‘sustained over time,’ 
particularly before administering CSH. 
However, no clear standard is set; the 
only guidance offered is the vague and 
clinically meaningless phrase ‘several 
years, leaving critical decisions open to 
broad and subjective interpretation.’ ’’
67
 
Regarding the WPATH guidelines, the 
HHS review states: 
On the surface, WPATH SOC–8 might 
appear to recommend a cautious 
approach toward assessment. Mental 
health providers are to conduct a 
‘‘comprehensive biopsychosocial 
assessment’’ prior to initiating medical 
interventions in order ‘‘to understand 
the adolescent’s strengths, 
vulnerabilities, diagnostic profile, and 
unique needs to individualize their 
care.’’ At the same time, however, 
WPATH recommends that clinicians use 
the International Classification of 
Diseases (ICD–11) diagnosis of ‘‘Gender 
Incongruence of Adolescence and 
Adulthood,’’ which, unlike the DSM–5 
diagnosis of ‘‘Gender Dysphoria,’’ 
requires only ‘‘marked and persistent 
incongruence between an individual’s 
experienced gender and the assigned 
sex.’’ Because SOC–8 defines 
transgender in a similar way (‘‘people 
whose gender identities and/or gender 
expressions are not what is typically 
expected for the sex to which they were 
assigned at birth’’) and provides no 
meaningful distinction between this 
meaning of transgender and gender non- 
conformity, SOC–8 effectively 
recognizes transgender identification as 
a medical condition justifying medical 
interventions.
68
 
The HHS Review also argues: 
‘‘Although WPATH’s guidelines do not 
necessarily discourage mental 
healthcare, they likewise do not require 
it as a precondition for PMT [pediatric 
medical transition]. Some guideline 
authors opposed even minimal 
requirements for mental health support, 
arguing that such provisions were 
analogous to ‘‘conversion therapy.’’ 
SOC–8’s only formal recommendation is 
for a ‘‘comprehensive biopsychosocial 
assessment,’’ although WPATH 
emphasizes that its guideline is 
‘‘flexible,’’ thereby leaving room for 
considerable variation in clinical 
practice.’’
69
 
While AMA and the AAP have not 
issued their own treatment guidelines, 
they support the ES and WPATH 
guidelines, as discussed previously in 
this proposed rule. AAP issued a policy 
statement in 2018 supporting the use of 
puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, 
and surgeries for minors.
70
In support of 
sex-rejecting surgeries, AAP stated that 
while ‘‘current protocols [(ES, WPATH)] 
typically reserve surgical interventions 
for adults, they are occasionally pursued 
during adolescence on a case-by-case 
basis, considering the necessity and 
benefit to the adolescent’s overall health 
and often including multidisciplinary 
input from medical, mental health, and 
surgical providers as well as from the 
adolescent and family.’’ The AAP 
reaffirmed its policy statement in 2023, 
but also stated that it was conducting its 
own review of the evidence and 
guideline development—which still 
have not been released.
71
Regarding the 
AAP policy statement, the HHS Review 
states: 
The AAP 2018 policy statement is not 
technically a CPG [clinical practice 
guideline] but has been widely cited in 
the U.S. as influential in establishing 
how pediatricians respond to children 
and adolescents with GD. Because the 
document offers extensive clinical 
recommendations regarding every step 
of PMT—from social transition to PBs 
[puberty blockers], CSH, and surgery— 
the York team assessed the 
trustworthiness of the AAP guidance 
using the same criteria they applied to 
CPGs. Using the AGREE II criteria, the 
AAP policy statement received the 
second-lowest average score among all 
international guidelines: 2 out of 7. As 
noted in Chapter 2, the AAP’s policy 
statement’s use of ‘‘gender diverse’’ 
casts a very wide net regarding which 
patients the organization considers 
eligible for medical intervention. The 
statement has been heavily criticized in 
peer-reviewed articles, which have 
pointed out that it is rife with 
referencing errors and inaccurate 
citations. Despite persistent advocacy 
among its members, who have 
petitioned the organization to release 
updated, evidence-based guidance for 
treating pediatric GD, the organization 
chose to reaffirm their policy statement 
in 2023.
72
 
In addition to other issues, we solicit 
comment of any published peer- 
reviewed findings that measure the 
effects of restrictions similar to those in 
this proposed rule on insurers, 
providers, and patients in international 
settings as well as the U.S. 
C. United States’ State Bans of and 
Coverage of Sex-Rejecting Procedures 
State lawmakers have adopted policy 
positions reflecting the emerging 
evidence of sex-rejecting procedures 
administered to youth. There are 27 
States and one Territory that have 
enacted laws restricting sex-rejecting 
procedures.

New Hampshire’s laws go into effect January 1,

Arizona and New Hampshire currently do not 
prohibit sex-rejecting procedures using 
medications; however, New Hampshire has a new 
policy (NH HB377) taking effect January 1, 2026, 
that would restrict sex-rejecting procedures using 
medications for minors. Nebraska currently 
restricts, but does not fully ban, access to sex- 
rejecting procedures using medications, so it was 
not included in this count. 
76
Arizona banned pediatric sex-rejecting 
surgeries in 2022. However, in 2023 the governor 
issued an executive order which removes the 
exclusion of coverage for sex-rejecting surgery 
under the state’s healthcare plan for state 
employees and prohibits investigative assistance to 
impose criminal or civil liability or professional 
sanctions on persons or entities for providing, 
assisting, seeking, or obtaining gender affirming 
care.

North Dakota, Nebraska, 
Ohio, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South

Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and 
Wyoming. As of August 8, 2025, some 
of these States have ongoing litigation 
proceedings impacting whether the 
State laws are partially or fully enjoined 
by a court. 
There are a mix of age ranges for these 
bans. Of the 28 States and Territories 
with enacted laws/policies (in effect or 
not), 25 States prohibit some sex- 
rejecting procedures to young people 
under the age of 18, two States prohibit 
them for those under the age of 19, and 
Puerto Rico prohibits them for those 
under the age of 21. 
Of the 24 States and one Territory 
with restriction statutes in effect as of 
August 8, 2025, 21 States and one 
Territory prohibit both the prescribing of at least one type of sex-rejecting 
medication and surgeries.75
No State 
bans only medications without also 
banning surgeries. However, all the 
States and the Territory with restrictions 
provide exceptions to the law/policies. 
The most common exceptions include 
procedures to treat: 
€A medically verifiable disorder of sexual development. This allows 
treatment for children who are born 
with medical conditions that affect their 
sexual development. These are rare 
conditions where a child’s reproductive 
or sexual anatomy does not develop in 
typical ways due to genetic, hormonal, 
or other medical factors that can be 
medically verified. 
€Any infection, injury, disease, or disorder that has been caused or 
exacerbated by the performance of 
gender transition procedures. 
€A physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would 
otherwise place the minor in danger of 
death or impairment of bodily function. 
We note that 12 States provide 
tapering off periods for patients who 
started puberty blockers or hormones 
before enactment of the State restriction, 
with some specifying specific dates (for 
example, in South Carolina services 
cannot go beyond January 31, 2025) and 
others specifying a period of time from 
the time of enactment (ranging between 
6 months and 1 year). Ten States have 
grandfather clauses primarily allowing 
minors who were already receiving 
treatment to continue receiving it 
indefinitely. However, we note that 
many of these States do not provide 
such exceptions or grandfather clauses 
for purposes of prohibitions on State 
funding, including for State funding 
under the Medicaid program and CHIP, 
for sex-rejecting procedures. 
Conversely, 14 States and the District 
of Columbia have shield laws protecting 
some or all sex-rejecting procedures, 
and three States have executive orders 
(State EOs) protecting these procedures. 
These States are Arizona,
76
California, 
Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, 
Illinois, Maine, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, 
New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode 
Island, Vermont, and Washington. 
Shield laws and State E.O.s often 
describe various types of sex-rejecting 
procedures broadly, including 
medications and surgeries, and include 
these under broader definitions of 
protected health care activities. These 
laws and State E.O.s generally attempt 
to shield providers and recipients (of all 
ages) against laws in other States that 
restrict these services. They also often 
protect providers from adverse action by 
medical malpractice insurers and 
licensure boards and allow for their 
address to remain confidential. One 
State, Maine, has a shield law specific 
to minors that allows minors 16 and 
over to receive hormone therapy when 
the guardian has refused sex-rejecting 
procedures. Four States explicitly 
provide child abuse and child custody 
protections for parents who supported 
their children in receiving sex-rejecting 
procedures. Four States have 
requirements for sex-rejecting 
procedures to be covered under health 
plans. Arizona requires coverage for 
State employee health plans. Illinois, 
Oregon, and Vermont require some level 
of coverage of sex-rejecting procedures 
by all health insurance providers. 
Vermont includes an exception for 
services that do not comply with 
Federal law. 
Some States may experience negative 
financial impacts as a result of having 
built their Medicaid programs and 
CHIPs, including policies and 
operations, on the understanding that 
we would make Federal Medicaid and 
CHIP payments to States for services 
that this proposed rule would define as 
sex-rejecting procedures. We believe 
protecting children enrolled in 
Medicaid and CHIP from the harms of 
sex-rejecting procedures, including 
possible long-term and irreversible 
harms, outweighs the possible financial 
costs some States may experience if they 
begin to pay with State funds the full 
cost of sex-rejecting procedures for 
children enrolled in Medicaid and 
CHIP. 
Providers in these States may be 
concerned that this proposed regulation 
would interfere with the physician- 
patient relationship. This proposed 
regulation would only prohibit Federal 
Medicaid and CHIP payment for certain 
services and does not require providers 
to communicate certain advice or 
information to patients. Federal 
Medicaid and CHIP payments will still 
be available for mental health 
counseling and psychotherapy for 
gender dysphoria. We believe a 
prohibition on Federal Medicaid and 
CHIP payments for sex-rejecting 
procedures is needed to avoid the 
possibility of minors receiving 
irreversible or risky pharmaceutical or 
surgical interventions, particularly in 
circumstances where the minor may be 
of an age to not have the capacity to 
understand the irreversible or long-term 
risks of these procedures or have the 
capacity to continue to communicate 
with providers their preferences 
regarding treatment after treatment has 
already begun. 
Certain medical providers may also be 
relying on continued Federal funding 
for sex-rejecting procedures. These 
providers may face financial harm by 
the loss of the revenue from the 
proposed limitations on Federal 
payment for these procedures; however, 
these providers have other avenues to 
continue to receive compensation for 
providing medical care. Providers may 
continue to receive payment for 
pharmaceutical or surgical interventions 
for purposes of aligning a child’s 
physical appearance or body with an 
asserted identity that differs from the 
child’s sex from sources other than 
Medicaid or CHIP. Providers may also 
receive payment for these services when

providing these procedures for the 
exempted purposes as outlined in the 
proposed rule. Lastly, providers may be 
paid through Medicaid and CHIP for 
providing other types of care for 
individuals diagnosed with gender 
dysphoria, such as psychotherapy. 
We also recognize that Medicaid and 
CHIP beneficiaries and their families 
would be impacted by this proposed 
rule. Families of these beneficiaries may 
look to obtain other health insurance or 
privately pay for these services. 
Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries who 
are unable to find alternative means to 
pay for these services may either have 
to rely on other methods of intervention 
such as psychotherapy or mental health 
counseling, or never begin receiving 
these services because of this proposed 
rule, if finalized. We are concerned 
about the difficulties that these minors 
may experience and encourage other, 
less invasive, ways to support these 
individuals, such as encouraging 
psychotherapy as a first line of 
treatment. 
This proposed rule would help to 
protect these children from the risks of 
adverse effects of sex-rejecting 
procedures. CMS carefully considered 
the scope of its limitation on Federal 
Medicaid and CHIP payments and 
permits coverage of other procedures, 
such as psychotherapy, which does not 
carry the same concerns of 
pharmaceutical or surgical interventions 
included in the definition of sex- 
rejecting procedures. Moreover, CMS 
does not believe Federal Medicaid and 
CHIP payment for these sex-rejecting 
procedures is consistent with quality of 
care given the state of the research into 
the effectiveness of these procedures for 
the purposes included in our proposed 
definition of this term, namely as 
treatments for gender dysphoria. In light 
of the HHS Review, CMS believes State 
reliance on certain medical 
organizations and the SOC–8 to justify 
covering sex-rejecting procedures is 
misplaced. 
In addition to other issues, we solicit 
comment on any published studies or 
findings that measure the effects of 
similar restrictions as proposed (or laws 
protecting these procedures) on 
insurers, providers, and patients in 
these States. 
Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court in 
United States v. Skrmetti, 605 U.S. 495 
(2025), upheld Tennessee’s law 
restricting certain surgical and chemical 
interventions for minors diagnosed with 
gender dysphoria (and similar 
conditions), referred to as Senate Bill 1 
or ‘‘SB1’’ in litigation challenging that 
law under the Equal Protection Clause 
of the U.S. Constitution. SB1 prohibits 
a healthcare provider from performing 
medical procedures, including surgery, 
and prescribing puberty blockers, for a 
minor for the purpose of enabling the 
minor to identify with a purported 
identity inconsistent with the minor’s 
sex. At the same time, SB1 allows 
healthcare providers to perform medical 
procedures for minors if the procedure 
is to treat a minor’s congenital defect, 
precocious puberty, disease, or physical 
injury. On June 18, 2025, the Court 
found that SB1’s prohibition of certain 
medical procedures for minors 
diagnosed with gender dysphoria 
incorporates classifications based on age 
and medical use—not the minor’s sex. 
Because the classifications turned on 
age and medical use rather than sex, the 
Court held that SB1 was not subject to 
heightened scrutiny under the Equal 
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment and went on to find the 
law satisfied rational basis review. As 
discussed in more detail later in this 
proposed rule, like the law at issue in 
Skrmetti, this proposed rule would not discriminate on the basis of sex and it 
is not based on an invidious 
discriminatory purpose. The proposed 
rule is animated by significant child 
safety concerns when sex-rejecting 
procedures are used for certain medical 
uses–that is to align a child’s physical 
appearance or body with an asserted 
identity that differs from the child’s sex. 
D. Psychotherapy as the First Line 
Treatment for Children Diagnosed With 
Gender Dysphoria 
Since 2010, there has been a 
significant increase in mental health 
conditions among teens and young 
adults.
77
Current research has not 
revealed a simple explanation for this 
rise in the need for youth mental health 
services. The etiology of gender 
dysphoria remains understudied.
78
 
However, patients presenting to 
pediatric gender medicine clinics have 
a high rate of comorbid mental health 
conditions.
79
 
We believe interested parties 
supporting the use of sex-rejecting 
procedures to treat gender dysphoria in 
children may state that limiting access 
to these treatments (which prohibiting 
Federal Medicaid and CHIP funding for 
them could do) will exacerbate these 
comorbidities and lead to adverse 
mental health outcomes and increase 
suicide risks. As noted previously, the 
Cass Review emphasized the lack of 
robust evidence regarding the 
effectiveness of interventions such as 
puberty blockers and cross-sex 
hormones to treat gender dysphoria and 
incongruence in children and 
adolescents.
80
Taylor et al. recently 
conducted a review of 23 international, 
national, and regional clinical 
guidelines that contained 
recommendations about the 
management of children/adolescents 
experiencing gender dysphoria. They 
found that the majority of these 
guidelines were developed without an 
independent or evidence-based 
approach and raised questions about the 
credibility of available guidance.
81
As 
Sweden’s national health authority has 
recommended, ‘‘[p]sychosocial support 
that helps adolescents deal with natal 
puberty without medication needs to be 
the first option when choosing care 
measures.’’
82
 
While evidence on the benefits of 
medical and surgical interventions to 
improve mental health or reduce 
symptoms of gender dysphoria is 
lacking, psychotherapy has been proven 
to be an effective intervention for many 
of the neurodevelopmental disorders 
and mental health conditions that are 
highly prevalent in children and 
adolescents, including those frequently 
co-occurring in patients diagnosed with 
gender dysphoria.
83
Psychotherapy and 
mental health counseling are non- 
invasive interventions that would 
remain available to youth under 
Medicaid’s mandatory Early and 
Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and 
Treatment (EPSDT) provisions in 
section 1905(r) of the Act. EPSDT 
requires the provision of screening, 
vision, dental, and hearing services, and 
such other necessary health care, 
diagnostic services, treatment, and other 
measures described in section 1905(a) of 
the Act to correct or ameliorate defects 
and physical and mental illness and 
conditions discovered by the screening 
services, whether or not such services 
are covered under the State plan. Most 
children enrolled in Medicaid are 
entitled to coverage of robust and 
comprehensive psychotherapy services 
under EPSDT . We note that under a 
State’s EPSDT program, States may only 
include tentative limits on services and 
must take into account the individual 
needs of the child. Thus, EPSDT is key

court vacated 42 CFR 440.262, 438.3(d)(4), and 
438.206(c)(2) (among others) ‘‘to the extent that they 
expand Title IX’s definition of sex discrimination 
to ensuring that children receive 
appropriate mental health screenings 
and treatments. Furthermore, we have 
developed numerous resources to 
provide information regarding services 
and good practices for children and 
youth with mental health conditions.
84
 
While EPSDT is not a required CHIP 
benefit for States that have separate 
CHIPs, many States with such programs 
have opted to provide EPSDT services 
that mirror the Medicaid standards set 
out at section 1905(r) of the Act to 
children enrolled in CHIP. In addition, 
section 2103(c)(7) of the Act requires 
States to provide mental health services 
in CHIP that are applied in the same 
manner as required under section 
2726(a) of the Public Health Service Act 
[([42 U.S.C. 300gg–26(a)])] for group 
health plans under such section. 
E. States’ Duty To Ensure Medicaid and 
CHIP Services for Children Are 
Consistent With Quality of Care and the 
Best Interests of Beneficiaries 
Under section 1902(a)(19) of the Act, 
State Medicaid agencies are required to 
ensure that Medicaid-covered services 
are in the best interests of beneficiaries; 
as relevant to this proposed rule, 
children under age 18. Additionally, 
States are required, under section 
1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act, to ensure that 
Medicaid payments for Medicaid 
covered services are consistent, in 
relevant part, with quality of care. 
Under section 2101(a) of the Act, CHIP 
programs are required to provide health 
care services to uninsured, low-income 
children in an effective and efficient 
manner that is coordinated with other 
sources of health benefits coverage for 
children, including State Medicaid 
programs. The research described 
previously in this proposed rule 
indicates that sex-rejecting procedures 
lack the necessary outcomes data to 
reasonably rely on for evidence of long- 
term effectiveness. 
On April 11, 2025, we issued a letter 
to State Medicaid Directors to ensure 
Medicaid agencies were aware of 
growing utilization of certain 
interventions offered to children to treat 
gender dysphoria, and to remind States 
of their statutory responsibilities to 
ensure that Medicaid payments are 
consistent with quality of care and that 
covered services are provided in a 
manner consistent with the best 
interests of recipients.
85
In the letter, we 
also stated that due to the 
underdeveloped body of evidence, the 
use of sex-rejecting procedures to treat 
gender dysphoria lacks reliable 
evidence of long-term benefits for 
minors and are now known to cause 
long-term and irreparable harm for some 
children.
86
A second letter, issued on 
May 28, 2025, was sent to a number of 
hospitals to address significant issues 
concerning quality standards and 
specific procedures affecting children 
diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The 
letter requested hospitals to provide 
information on their policies and 
procedures related to the adequacy of 
informed consent protocols for children 
diagnosed with gender dysphoria, 
including how children are deemed 
capable of making these potentially life 
changing decisions and when parental 
consent is required; changes to clinical 
practice guidelines and protocols that 
the institution plans to enact in light of 
the recent comprehensive review and 
guidance released by the Department; 
medical evidence and any adverse 
events related to these procedures, 
particularly children who later look to 
detransition; and complete financial 
data for all pediatric sex-rejecting 
procedures performed at the institution 
and paid, in whole or in part, by the 
Federal Government.
87
 
As outlined previously in this 
proposed rule, we take very seriously 
the absence of rigorous scientific data 
demonstrating the effectiveness of sex- 
rejecting procedures and the 
considerable evidence regarding the 
risks. Given the potential risks and lack 
of clear benefits associated with sex- 
rejecting procedures, we believe that 
covering them with Federal Medicaid or 
CHIP funding would be, for Medicaid 
beneficiaries, inconsistent with their 
best interests and with quality of care; 
and, for CHIP beneficiaries, inconsistent 
with the provision of health care 
services to uninsured, low-income 
children in an effective and efficient 
manner that is coordinated with other 
sources of health benefits coverage. In 
this section, we describe how this 
proposed rule would intersect with 
existing statutory and regulatory 
provisions. 
1. Intersection With Nondiscrimination 
(Section 1557 of the Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act) 
This proposed rule is not a form of 
sex discrimination in violation of 
section 1557 of the Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act (Affordable 
Care Act).
88
Section 1557 of the 
Affordable Care Act prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of race, 
color, national origin, sex, age, or 
disability in health programs or 
activities, any part of which is receiving 
Federal financial assistance. 
A Federal court recently considered 
the question of whether the prohibition 
on sex discrimination found in section 
1557 of the Affordable Care Act 
includes discrimination on the basis of 
gender identity. On October 22, 2025, in 
State of Tennessee et al v. Kennedy et al,
89
the district court declared that 
‘‘HHS exceeded its statutory authority 
when (1) it interpreted Title IX, as 
incorporated into Section 1557, to 
prohibit discrimination on the basis of 
gender identity, and (2) when it 
implemented Section 1557 regulations 
concerning gender identity and ‘gender 
affirming care.’ ’’ Accordingly, the Court 
vacated the following regulations to the 
extent that they expand Title IX’s 
definition of sex discrimination to 
include gender-identity discrimination: 
42 CFR 438.3(d)(4), 438.206(c)(2), 
440.262, 460.98(b)(3), and 460.112(a), 
and 45 CFR 92.101(a)(2)(iv), 
92.206(b)(1)–(4), § 92.207(b)(3) 
through(5), 92.8(b)(1), 92.10(a)(1)(i), and 
92.208.

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with PROPOSALS159451 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Proposed Rules to include gender identity discrimination’’ and 
declared HHS had ‘‘exceeded its statutory authority 
when (1) it interpreted Title IX, as incorporated into 
Section 1557, to prohibit discrimination on the 
basis of gender identity, and (2) when it 
implemented Section 1557 regulations concerning 
gender identity and ‘gender affirming care.’’’ See 
also Texas v. Becerra, No. 6:24–CV–211–JDK (E.D. 
Tex. Aug. 30, 2024), in which the court entered a 
nationwide stay of certain regulations of the final 
rule, including 42 CFR 440.262, 438.3(d)(4), and 
438.206(c)(2). Given Skrmetti’s holding, we believe 
that the outcome of this litigation will not affect the 
proposed rule. As a result, CMS does not further 
discuss 42 CFR 440.262, 438.3, and 438.206 in this 
proposed rule. 
91
Tenn. Code Ann. § 68–33–101 et seq. 
92
As defined by SB1, ‘‘minor’’ means an 
individual under eighteen (18) years of age. Tenn. 
Code Ann. § 68–33–102. 
93
United States v. Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. 1816 (2025). 
94
Section 1905(a)(6) of the Act states ‘‘medical 
care, or any other type of remedial care recognized 
under State law, furnished by licensed practitioners 
within the scope of their practice as defined by 
State law’’ and section 2110(a)(24) of the Act 
defines ‘‘child health assistance’’ as ‘‘payment for 
part or all of the cost of health benefits coverage for 
targeted low-income children that includes any of 
the following . . . (24) Any other medical, 
diagnostic, screening, preventive, restorative, 
remedial, therapeutic, or rehabilitative services . . . 
if recognized by State law . . .’’ 
Notwithstanding the outcome of this 
litigation, the Court’s holding in 
Skrmetti, as explained previously in this proposed rule and expounded upon 
below, supports our position that this 
proposed rule would not discriminate 
on the basis of sex. In 2023, Tennessee 
enacted a State law,
91
SB1, which, in 
relevant part, prohibits a healthcare 
provider from performing certain 
medical procedures, including surgery, 
and from prescribing puberty blockers, 
for a minor for the purpose of enabling 
the minor to identify with a purported 
identity inconsistent with the minor’s 
sex.
92
SB1 does not prohibit healthcare 
providers from providing those 
procedures if done to treat a minor’s 
congenital defect, precocious puberty, 
disease, or physical injury. The U.S. 
Supreme Court analyzed SB1 under the 
Equal Protection Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment and held that 
SB1 does not turn on sex-based 
classifications, noting ‘‘the law does not 
prohibit conduct for one sex that it 
permits for the other.’’
93
 
Like SB1, this proposed rule would 
apply uniformly to all children 
regardless of the child’s sex. This 
proposed rule would treat all children 
the same when it would prohibit a State 
Medicaid or CHIP agency from covering, 
as part of its Federally funded Medicaid 
program and CHIP, the procedures that 
the proposed rule would define as sex- 
rejecting procedures. At the same time, 
this proposed rule would permit State 
Medicaid and CHIP agencies to continue 
to so cover procedures when the child 
has a medically verifiable disorder of 
sexual development, needs the 
procedure for a purpose other than 
attempting to align the child’s physical 
appearance or body with an asserted 
identity that differs from the child’s sex, 
or has complications, including any 
infection, injury, disease, or disorder 
that has been caused by or exacerbated 
by the performance of sex-rejecting 
procedure(s). 
Further, this proposed rule would be 
neither arbitrary nor based on an 
invidious discriminatory purpose. 
Rather, based on the review of current 
research and the reasoning for similar 
conclusions reached and actions taken 
by multiple European countries 
discussed previously in this proposed 
rule, we believe that Medicaid and CHIP 
coverage and payment of sex-rejecting 
procedures are not in the best interests 
of minors and not consistent with 
quality of care or the effective and 
efficient standard required under 
section 2101(a) of the Act. Therefore, we 
are proposing to prohibit Federal 
funding for these procedures in 
Medicaid and CHIP. This proposal is 
based on careful consideration of the 
facts as described in detail in section 
I.B. of this proposed rule and on our 
determination that the risks of sex- 
rejecting procedures for children 
outweigh the benefits. We continue to 
support Medicaid and CHIP coverage of 
services for children that research 
shows may be helpful for treating 
gender dysphoria in children without 
the risks of harm. Further, while State 
laws may differ, State Medicaid 
agencies are not currently specifically 
prohibited under Federal law from 
covering sex-rejecting procedures for 
Medicaid beneficiaries who are 18 years 
of age and older. 
2. Intersection With Sufficiency of 
Amount, Duration, and Scope 
(§ 440.230(c)) 
This proposed rule would also be 
consistent with 42 CFR 440.230, which 
provides that a Medicaid State plan 
must specify the amount, duration, and 
scope of covered services. CMS has long 
afforded State Medicaid agencies 
considerable flexibility under § 440.230 
to establish the amount, duration, and 
scope of covered Medicaid services, and 
to develop State-specific medical 
necessity criteria and utilization control 
procedures for covered services. State- 
specific limits on amount, duration, and 
scope are frequently applied based on 
an assessment of a beneficiary’s specific 
circumstances, rather than being blanket 
limitations. In addition to specifying the 
amount, duration, and scope of covered 
services, historically, States have 
determined whether, and how, to cover 
services and we make Federal Medicaid 
payments to States if the services 
otherwise complied with Federal law 
and regulation. Within CHIP, under 
§ 457.402(x), States have the ability to 
add coverage of additional services if 
recognized by State law. 
Some States may be using the 
authorities under sections 1905 and 
2110 of the Act, such as sections 
1905(a)(6) and 2110(a)(24) of the Act,
94
 
to cover sex-rejecting procedures as 
services that are recognized under State 
law. 
However, this flexibility under 
§ 440.230 is not absolute. Section 
440.230 requires State Medicaid 
agencies to comply with certain 
guidelines when determining the 
amount, duration, and scope of covered 
services. States must detail their 
proposed coverage of services in a State 
plan amendment and submit the State 
plan amendment to CMS for approval. 
We review the State plan amendment to 
ensure that States meet these guidelines. 
For example, under § 440.230(b), State 
Medicaid agencies must ensure that any 
covered service is sufficient in amount, 
duration, and scope to reasonably 
achieve its purpose. If a state limits the 
amount, duration or scope of a service 
without exception for medical necessity, 
the State must explain to us the 
reasoning and evidence to support the 
limitation prior to CMS approving the 
State’s submission. Similarly in CHIP, 
the flexibility under § 457.402(x) is not 
absolute. Section 457.60 requires States 
to submit a State plan amendment when 
a State is making a change in policy or 
operation of the program that affects the 
benefits provided. Like in Medicaid, 
States must detail their proposed 
coverage of services in a State plan 
amendment and submit the State plan 
amendment to CMS for approval. We 
review the State plan amendment to 
ensure that States meet these guidelines. 
For this proposed rule, we have 
considered the risk/benefit profile of 
sex-rejecting procedures for the 
purposes included in our proposed 
definition and the alternative treatments 
available, before determining that a 
national response prohibiting Federal 
Medicaid funding for sex-rejecting 
procedures for children under age 18 
enrolled in Medicaid and under age 19 
enrolled in CHIP is warranted. This 
prohibition includes circumstances in 
which a provider may determine that a 
sex-rejecting procedure is medically 
necessary for a child diagnosed with 
gender dysphoria.

Requirements,’’ September 26, 2024, https://
www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy-guidance/ 
downloads/sho24005.pdf. 
Lastly, this proposed rule is 
consistent with § 440.230(c), which 
prohibits State Medicaid agencies from 
arbitrarily denying or reducing the 
amount, duration, or scope of a covered 
service to an otherwise eligible 
beneficiary solely because of the 
diagnosis, type of illness, or condition. 
This proposed rule reflects the agency’s 
efforts to address significant concerns 
about the risk/benefit profile of sex- 
rejecting procedures for the uses 
included in our proposed definition of 
that term, due to the safety concerns, 
risks of irreversible harm, long-term 
health outcomes, and unestablished 
effectiveness associated with those uses, 
as explained previously. This proposed 
rule takes into account the different 
risk/benefit profiles of different uses of 
these procedures, which is why it 
focuses on purposes that might be 
associated with a particular diagnosis, 
type of illness or condition. Our 
proposed definition of sex-rejecting 
procedures would exclude from the 
definition certain uses of these 
procedures for which the risk/benefit 
profile creates less significant concerns. 
Additionally, other treatments, such as 
mental health treatment, would remain 
Federally funded for children diagnosed 
with gender dysphoria. 
As discussed previously in this 
proposed rule, we have considered the 
concerns of States, providers, and 
beneficiaries who have relied on CMS 
making Federal Medicaid and CHIP 
payment for these services. 
Notwithstanding the potential financial 
burden to States, providers, and 
individuals, and the psychological and 
physical impact on beneficiaries who 
wish to receive these services, a 
nationwide prohibition on Federal 
Medicaid and CHIP payments for these 
services is warranted. We believe that 
the concerns of States, providers and 
beneficiaries described previously in 
this proposed rule are outweighed by 
the potential harm of sex-rejecting 
procedures for minors, including 
potential long-term harm, especially 
when the possible benefits of these 
services are unproven and the 
procedures are irreversible. More data is 
needed on how the procedures that the 
proposed rule would define as sex- 
rejecting procedures in children under 
age 18 in Medicaid and under age 19 in 
CHIP affect the long-term health of such 
individuals, including any impact on 
fertility, and whether these procedures 
result in, or increase the risk of, sexual 
dysfunction, impaired boned density, 
adverse cognitive impacts and other 
health deviations, as mentioned 
previously. 
3. Intersection With Early and Periodic 
Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment 
(EPSDT) 
This proposed rule also would be 
consistent with States’ obligations under 
the EPSDT requirement, even though it 
would limit States’ longstanding 
flexibility to develop State-specific 
processes for determining when a 
service is medically necessary for an 
EPSDT-eligible beneficiary under 
section 1905(r)(5) of the Act. Under 
EPSDT, States must cover medically 
necessary services described in section 
1905(a) of the Act for most Medicaid 
eligible children under the age of 21. 
Children eligible for EPSDT generally 
include beneficiaries under the age of 21 
enrolled: in Medicaid through a 
categorically needy group; in Medicaid 
through a medically needy group in a 
State that has elected to include EPSDT 
in the medically needy benefit package; 
in a Medicaid-expansion CHIP program; 
or in a separate CHIP program that has 
elected to cover EPSDT. This includes 
beneficiaries with an institutional level 
of care who are eligible for Medicaid by 
virtue of their enrollment in a home and 
community-based services (HCBS) 
waiver under section 1915(c) of the Act. 
EPSDT is not available to beneficiaries 
without satisfactory immigration status 
who are eligible only for treatment of an 
emergency medical condition and other 
groups of individuals under age 21 who 
are eligible only for limited services as 
part of their Medicaid eligibility, such 
as, for example, family planning 
services. 
Under this proposed rule, sex- 
rejecting procedures for the uses 
included in our proposed definition 
would no longer be Federally funded as 
Medicaid-covered services for 
individuals under the age of 18 or as 
CHIP-covered services for individuals 
under the age of 19, because such 
services may pose a risk of harm to 
children, including long-term 
irreversible harm, and result in adverse 
outcomes on their health including 
infertility/sterility, sexual dysfunction, 
impaired bone density accrual, adverse 
cognitive impacts, cardiovascular 
disease and metabolic disorders, and 
psychiatric disorders. We are not 
endorsing or requiring any particular 
treatment modality for gender 
dysphoria. 
In our prior EPSDT coverage 
guidance,
95 96
we discuss how States 
should approach their determination of 
whether a service is medically 
necessary. In this prior guidance, we 
emphasize that States (or their delegated 
entity) must take into account the 
particular needs of the child. We 
explain that States should consider the 
child’s long-term needs, not just what is 
required to address the immediate 
situation. The State should consider all 
aspects of a child’s needs, including 
nutrition, social development, and 
mental health and substance use 
disorders. Accordingly, while sex- 
rejecting procedures have been covered 
by some State Medicaid programs to 
address gender dysphoria to alleviate its 
symptoms, these procedures can involve 
use of puberty suppressing drugs to 
prevent the onset of puberty and cross- 
sex hormones to spur the secondary sex 
characteristics of the opposite sex. For 
children under 18 (or under 19 in CHIP) 
who have undergone the suppression of 
puberty, these procedures may pose a 
significant risk of harm, including 
possible long-term harm to a child’s 
health, including the risk of infertility 
and bone density loss, as discussed 
previously. 
As discussed previously in this 
proposed rule, some State Medicaid 
programs and CHIPs have relied upon 
clinical guidelines that have failed to 
meet the principles of unbiased, 
evidence-driven clinical guideline 
development. As a result of this 
reliance, State Medicaid programs and 
CHIPs have developed coverage criteria 
which may not have considered the full 
effects of all aspects of a child’s needs 
(including long-term needs) as required 
under EPSDT. 
F. Prohibition on Federal Funding and 
Coverage in a Separate CHIP 
Title XXI of the Act allows States to 
implement CHIP as a separate CHIP, a 
Medicaid-expansion program, or a 
combination of the two. Title XXI- 
funded Medicaid expansion programs 
generally follow Medicaid rules. This 
section relates to separate CHIPs. 
States with separate CHIPs receive 
Federal funding from the title XXI 
allotment to provide child health 
assistance through obtaining coverage 
that meets the requirements of section 
2103 of the Act and regulations at 
§ 457.402. Section 2101(a) of the Act 
calls for the provision of CHIP in a 
manner that is effective and efficient 
and coordinated with other sources of

requirement that issuers of non-grandfathered 
individual and small group market health insurance

essential health benefit (EHB) requirements— 
cannot provide coverage for ‘‘specified sex-trait

health benefits coverage for children, 
notwithstanding section 2110(a)(24) of 
the Act that allows States to cover 
additional services that are recognized 
by State law. While CMS recognizes the 
considerable State flexibility provided 
to States under section 2110(a)(24) of 
the Act, CMS has concluded that it is in 
the best interest of children under age 
19 enrolled in CHIP to no longer permit 
Federal funding for coverage of 
procedures when utilized for purposes 
of sex-rejecting procedures because such 
services may result in adverse outcomes 
on their health including infertility/ 
sterility, sexual dysfunction, impaired 
bone density accrual, diverse cognitive, 
cardiovascular disease and metabolic 
disorders, and psychiatric disorders. 
Therefore, CMS has concluded it is most 
efficient and effective, and in the best 
interests of children, for CHIP to align 
and coordinate with the Medicaid 
program. 
Section 2103 of the Act and § 457.410 
allow States to choose any of the 
following four types of health benefits 
coverage for separate CHIPs: (1) 
Benchmark coverage in accordance with 
§ 457.420; (2) Benchmark-equivalent 
coverage in accordance with § 457.430; 
(3) Existing comprehensive State-based 
coverage in accordance with § 457.440; 
and (4) Secretary-approved coverage in 
accordance with § 457.450. Regardless 
of the type of health coverage selected 
by a State, States are required to provide 
all services identified at § 457.410(b) to 
children enrolled in CHIP. In addition 
to these services, States have the 
flexibility to cover additional services at 
§ 457.402, which lists the services 
included in ‘‘child health assistance.’’ In 
addition to the specified services, 
§ 457.402(x) permits states to select 
additional services and treatments that 
it will cover. The majority of separate 
CHIP States have elected Secretary- 
approved coverage. Under Secretary- 
approved coverage at § 457.450, the 
Secretary currently has the discretion to 
determine whether the coverage 
provided by a State is appropriate 
coverage for the population of targeted 
low-income children covered under the 
program. Recently, there have also been 
changes to allowable procedures under 
the benchmark coverage options for 
CHIP under § 457.420 as described later 
in this proposed rule. 
On June 20, 2025, we issued the 
‘‘Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act; Marketplace Integrity and 
Affordability,’’ final rule (90 FR 27074) 
(referred to hereafter as the ‘‘2025 
Marketplace final rule’’), which 
prohibits issuers of non-grandfathered 
individual and small group market 
health insurance coverage—that is, 
issuers of coverage subject to the 
essential health benefit (EHB) 
requirements—from providing coverage 
for ‘‘specified sex-trait modification 
procedures’’ as an EHB beginning with 
Plan Year 2026. This prohibition was 
proposed and finalized because section 
1302(b)(2)(A) of the ACA requires that 
the scope of the EHB be equal to the 
scope of benefits provided under a 
typical employer plan, and coverage of 
such procedures is not typically 
included in employer-sponsored 
plans.
97
In addition, on January 31, 
2025, the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management issued letter 2025–01A, 
which prohibited coverage of certain 
surgeries and hormone treatments for 
covered individuals in Federal 
Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) and 
Postal Service Health Benefits (PSHB) 
Programs under age 19. That letter was 
amended by letter 2015–01B, issued on 
August 15, 2025, which eliminated the 
age limit and advised that for Plan Year 
2026, chemical and surgical 
modification of an individual’s sex traits 
through medical interventions (to 
include ‘‘gender transition’’ services) 
will no longer be covered under the 
FEHB or PSHB Programs. Specifically, it 
excludes hormone treatments that 
pertain to chemical and surgical 
modification of an individual’s sex traits 
(including as part of ‘‘gender transition’’ 
services) and clarifies that carriers 
should not exclude coverage for entire 
classes of pharmaceuticals. For 
example, GnRH agonists may be 
prescribed during in vitro fertilization 
(IVF), for reduction of endometriosis or 
fibroids, and for cancer treatment or 
prostate cancer/tumor growth 
prevention.

As previously noted, section 2101(a) 
of the Act provides funds to States to 
enable them to initiate and expand the 
provision of child health assistance to 
uninsured, low-income children in an 
effective and efficient manner that is 
coordinated with other sources of health 
benefits coverage for children. As 
outlined previously in this proposed 
rule, while the prohibitions on coverage 
are not identical, they will effectively 
result in prohibition of coverage of sex- 
rejecting procedures in both the FEHB 
Program and as an EHB beginning with 
Plan Year 2026. Therefore, we are 
proposing to add a new section 
§ 457.476 to prohibit Federal financial 
participation for sex-rejecting 
procedures under CHIP, to align CHIP 
with Medicaid, the FEHB Program, and 
EHBs. Although title XXI of the Act 
does not apply EHB rules under a 
separate CHIP, the services which must 
be covered under title XXI also are 
EHBs. We note that similar to Medicaid, 
this proposed change in CHIP would not 
prohibit Federal payment for procedures 
undertaken to treat a child with a 
medically verifiable disorder of sexual 
development; for purposes other than 
attempting to align a child’s physical 
appearance or body with an asserted 
identity that differs from the child’s sex; 
or to treat complications, including any 
infection, injury, disease, or disorder 
that has been caused by or exacerbated 
by the performance of sex-rejecting 
procedure(s). 
We also note that section 2107(e) of 
the Act applies numerous provisions in 
Medicaid in the same manner to title 
XXI as would be the case under this 
proposed rule. 
We take very seriously the weak 
evidence base supporting the safety or 
effectiveness of sex-rejecting procedures 
in minors, and the plausible evidence of 
harm, for the purposes included in our 
proposed definition. Based on these 
factors, we propose to prohibit Federal 
CHIP funds for sex-rejecting procedures 
for the purposes included in our 
proposed definition. It is also important 
to reiterate that these regulatory changes 
would not prohibit the use of Federal 
CHIP dollars for mental health 
treatments for conditions such as gender 
dysphoria. 
II. Provisions of the Proposed 
Regulations 
A. General Discussion 
We propose to exercise our separate 
authorities under sections 1902(a)(19) 
and 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act to add a 
new subpart N to part 441 to prohibit 
Federal Financial Participation (FFP) in 
Medicaid for sex-rejecting procedures 
for the purposes included in our 
proposed definition for individuals 
under the age of 18, as this is the age 
of majority in most States. For CHIP, we

CMS is aware that 3 States—Alabama, 
Nebraska, and Mississippi—recognize higher ages 
as the age of majority. See ‘‘Age of Majority by State 
2025,’’ World Population Review, accessed August 
11, 2025, https://worldpopulationreview.com/state- 
rankings/age-of-majority-by-state. CMS is proposing to prohibit FFP in State expenditures within the 
Medicaid program for sex-rejecting procedures for 
children under the age of 18 to correspond to the 
legal age of majority used by the overwhelming 
majority of States and Territories. Because section 
2110(c)(1) of the Act defines ‘‘child’’ for purposes 
of CHIP as an individual under age 19, CMS is 
proposing to prohibit FFP in State expenditures 
within CHIP for sex-rejecting procedures for 
children under age 19.

propose to exercise our authority under 
section 2103(c) of the Act to revise 
subpart D of 42 CFR part 457 to prohibit 
the use of Federal CHIP dollars to fund 
sex-rejecting procedures for the 
purposes included in our proposed 
definition for individuals under the age 
of 19, as this age aligns with the 
statutory definition of ‘‘child’’ at 
2110(c)(1) of the Act. While this 
proposal aligns with section 5(a) of E.O. 
14187, we are also proposing this 
change based on current evidence, 
which does not conclusively support 
the use of sex-rejecting procedures to 
treat gender dysphoria in children. It is 
important to emphasize that these 
proposed regulatory changes would not 
prohibit the use of Federal Medicaid or 
CHIP dollars for mental health 
treatments for conditions such as gender 
dysphoria. Nor would these proposed 
changes prevent States from providing 
coverage for sex-rejecting procedures 
with State-only funds outside of the 
Federally-matched Medicaid program or 
CHIP. We note that this proposed rule 
also does not prohibit Federal 
reimbursement of procedures 
undertaken (i) to treat a child with a 
medically verifiable disorder of sexual 
development; (ii) for purposes other 
than attempting to align a child’s 
physical appearance or body with an 
asserted identity that differs from the 
child’s sex; or (iii) to treat 
complications, including any infection, 
injury, disease, or disorder that has been 
caused by or exacerbated by the 
performance of sex-rejecting 
procedure(s). 
B. Prohibition on Medicaid Payment for 
Sex-Rejecting Procedures (§ 441.800) 
We propose to add a new subpart N 
to 42 CFR part 441 to protect Medicaid 
beneficiaries and ensure Medicaid 
payments are consistent with quality of 
care by prohibiting Federal Medicaid 
payments to States for sex-rejecting 
procedures provided to children under 
the age of 18. The basis and purpose of 
proposed subpart N (as described 
previously in this proposed rule) is 
reflected in proposed § 441.800. 
Within new subpart N, we propose at 
§ 441.802(a) that State Medicaid plans 
must provide that the Medicaid agency 
will not make payment under the plan 
for sex-rejecting procedures for children 
under the age of 18. Per 42 CFR 430.10, 
the State plan is the vehicle through 
which States assure that their Medicaid 
programs will be administered in 
conformity with title XIX of the Act 
(including sections 1902(a)(19) and 
1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act) and CMS’ 
implementing regulations, and the State 
plan must also contain all information 
necessary for CMS to determine whether 
the plan can serve as a basis for FFP. 
Proposed § 441.802(a) would not 
preclude States from covering sex- 
rejecting procedures with State-only 
funding outside of their Federally- 
matched Medicaid programs. We 
propose at § 441.802(b) that FFP would 
not be available in State expenditures 
for sex-rejecting procedures for children 
under the age of 18. 
Proposed § 441.801 would define sex- 
rejecting procedures as any 
pharmaceutical or surgical intervention 
that attempts to align a child’s physical 
appearance or body with an asserted 
identity that differs from the child’s sex 
either by: (1) intentionally disrupting or 
suppressing the normal development of 
natural biological functions, including 
primary or secondary sex-based traits; or 
(2) intentionally altering a child’s 
physical appearance or body, including 
amputating, minimizing, or destroying 
primary or secondary sex-based traits 
such as the sexual and reproductive 
organs. However, our proposed 
definition also provides that the term 
sex-rejecting procedures would not 
include procedures undertaken: (i) to 
treat a child with a medically verifiable 
disorder of sexual development; (ii) for 
purposes other than attempting to align 
a child’s physical appearance or body 
with an asserted identity that differs 
from the child’s sex; or (iii) to treat 
complications, including any infection, 
injury, disease, or disorder that has been 
caused by or exacerbated by the 
performance of sex-rejecting 
procedure(s). 
Given States’ obligations under 
sections 1902(a)(19) and 1902(a)(30)(A) 
of the Act to assure care and services are 
provided consistent with the best 
interests of Medicaid recipients and that 
payments are consistent with quality of 
care, respectively, we believe that our 
proposed prohibition of FFP in State 
expenditures for sex-rejecting 
procedures for children under age 18 is 
necessary given the lack of an adequate 
evidence base for the effectiveness of 
these treatments for the purposes that 
would be included in our proposed 
definition and the significant potential 
for negative and irreversible side effects. 
We note that CMS has imposed age 
limitations on the availability of Federal 
funding for certain procedures in the 
Medicaid program before. CMS has long 
prohibited, at § 441.253, Federal 
funding for permanent sterilizations 
furnished to individuals under age 21, 
motivated by concerns about potential 
coercion, informed consent, and patient 
regret that were based on data 
specifically related to permanent 
sterilizations (see preamble discussion 
at 43 FR 52146, 52151 through 52153). 
In this context, our concerns about the 
effectiveness of sex-rejecting procedures 
and the plausible evidence of harm 
motivate our proposal to prohibit 
Federal funding for sex-rejecting 
procedures for children under the age of 
18. Specifically, this proposed rule 
recognizes that the more cautious 
approach of psychosocial support to 
treat individuals diagnosed with gender 
dysphoria prior to age 18—the legal age 
of majority in nearly all U.S. States and 
Territories
99 100
—better protects 
children and youth from adverse effects 
of any such procedures. 
Three states have a different, higher 
age of majority. Alabama and Nebraska’s 
age of majority is 19 and Mississippi has 
the highest age of majority at 21.
101
This 
rule would not conflict with the age of 
majority in Alabama, Nebraska and 
Mississippi because these States 
recognize higher ages of majority than 
this proposed rule. Under this proposed 
rule, sex-rejecting procedures would be 
available for Medicaid coverage at age 
18, which is a lower age than the age of 
majority in these States. Additionally, 
nothing in this proposed rule preempts 
State authority to regulate the age of 
majority in their State, nor does it 
interfere with a State’s ability to fund 
these services with State-only funds. 
Further, it is clear that in making policy 
choices for the administration of a 
Federal program, State law is not 
controlling. This proposed rule would 
make age 18 the floor of Federal 
coverage for sex-rejecting procedures 
under the Medicaid program, should a 
State include such procedures in their 
program. 
We originally considered establishing 
the prohibition on Federal 
reimbursement of sex-rejecting 
procedures to individuals under age 19 
as we are now proposing for CHIP.

However, age 19 has no specific 
meaning for the Medicaid program and, 
as stated, is a year older than the legal 
age of majority in nearly all U.S. States 
and Territories. By comparison, this is 
not true under CHIP, as the statutory 
definition of a child in CHIP under 
section 2110(c)(1) of the Act is an 
individual under 19 years of age. In 
addition to other issues, we solicit 
comment on the operational feasibility 
of States in implementing the under age 
18 prohibition in Medicaid and the 
under age 19 prohibition in CHIP. 
As discussed previously, States have 
obligations under sections 1902(a)(19) 
and 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act to ensure 
that Medicaid-covered care and services 
are provided in a manner consistent 
with the best interests of beneficiaries 
and to assure that payments for 
Medicaid-covered care and services are 
consistent with quality of care. For the 
reasons discussed in this proposed rule, 
CMS believes prohibiting Federal 
Medicaid funding for sex-rejecting 
procedures for children under the age of 
18 is warranted to help ensure that 
States meet these statutory obligations. 
We believe that the proposed 
definition of sex-rejecting procedures 
provides an appropriate degree of clarity 
and certainty regarding which sex- 
rejecting procedures would and would 
not be subject to the prohibitions at 
proposed § 441.802. We believe the 
proposed definition is narrowly tailored 
and appropriate to exclude only 
treatments CMS has determined to lack 
sufficient evidence of safety for their 
intended purposes. Examples such as 
procedures to treat precocious puberty, 
therapy subsequent to a traumatic 
injury, or the use of hormone 
replacement therapy to treat a growth 
hormone deficiency would not fall 
under the proposed definition of sex- 
rejecting procedures, and Federal 
Medicaid payment for such procedures 
would therefore not be prohibited for 
individuals under the age of 18, when 
medically necessary. As the HHS 
Review explains, central precocious 
puberty and gender dysphoria are 
distinct clinical entities. In addition, 
because the proposed definition is 
narrowly tailored in this way, we 
believe that States will be able to 
administer Medicaid coverage for drugs 
in a manner that is consistent with both 
the proposed rule and the requirements 
in section 1927 of the Act. Section 1927 
of the Act governs the Medicaid Drug 
Rebate Program and payment for 
covered outpatient drugs (CODs), which 
are defined in section 1927(k)(2) of the 
Act. In general, if manufacturers enter 
into a National Drug Rebate Agreement 
(NDRA) as set forth in section 1927(a) of 
the Act, payment is available for the 
CODs covered under that NDRA for 
medically accepted indications.
102
As 
defined in section 1927(k)(6) of the Act, 
‘‘medically accepted indications’’ mean 
use for a COD approved under the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
or approved for inclusion in any of the 
compendia described in subsection 
1927(g)(1)(B)(i) of the Act. There is no 
pharmaceutical that is solely indicated 
for these sex-rejecting procedures; the 
pharmaceuticals that are used for these 
procedures are approved for other 
indications. Thus, these 
pharmaceuticals will continue to be 
coverable by Medicaid programs for 
other indications in accordance with 
section 1927 of the Act. In addition, we 
note that this proposed rule only applies 
to pharmaceuticals that are used in the 
proposed definition and would not 
apply to other pharmaceuticals that are 
prescribed to a child. 
As noted previously, the proposed 
definition of sex-rejecting procedures 
categorically would exclude procedures 
undertaken (1) to treat a child with a 
medically verifiable disorder of sexual 
development; (2) for purposes other 
than attempting to align a child’s 
physical appearance or body with an 
asserted identity that differs from the 
child’s sex; or (3) to treat complications, 
including any infection, injury, disease, 
or disorder that has been caused by or 
exacerbated by the performance of sex- 
rejecting procedure(s). We reiterate that 
these proposed regulatory changes 
would not prohibit the use of Federal 
Medicaid dollars for mental health 
treatments for conditions such as gender 
dysphoria. 
In addition, to further explain the 
meaning of terms used in the proposed 
sex-rejecting procedures definition, we 
also propose definitions at new 
§ 441.801 that would apply to subpart N 
of part 441. We propose to define FFP 
for purposes of subpart N of part 441 as 
Federal financial participation, 
recognizing the longstanding term used 
in the Medicaid program to describe the 
Federal Government’s matching 
arrangement with States and Territories. 
We also propose to define ‘‘female’’ as 
a person of the sex characterized by a 
reproductive system with the biological 
function of (at maturity, absent 
disruption or congenital anomaly) 
producing eggs (ova). We propose to 
define ‘‘male’’ as a person of the sex 
characterized by a reproductive system 
with the biological function of (at 
maturity, absent disruption or 
congenital anomaly) producing sperm. 
We propose to define ‘‘sex’’ as a 
person’s immutable biological 
classification as either male or female. 
A landmark study of and model for 
anisogamy established that differences 
in gamete size, and the associated 
differences in gamete production time, 
lead to stable sexual dimorphism and 
the establishment of two biological 
sexes: ovum producers (females) and 
sperm producers (males).
103
 
Additionally, more recent literature 
acknowledges differences in sex roles 
but maintains that such differences can 
still be traced to the concept of 
anisogamy and the resultant sexual 
dimorphism that remain the root cause 
of sex specific selection, the sex roles, 
and the determination of biological 
sex.
104
We believe our proposed 
definitions of female, male, and sex are 
appropriately rooted in this concept and 
biological reality. In addition to other 
issues, we solicit comments on whether 
these proposed definitions of ‘‘sex’’, 
‘‘male’’, and ‘‘female’’ could pose 
challenges to States in operationalizing 
this proposed prohibition on Federal 
reimbursement of sex-rejecting 
procedures or other aspects of the 
Medicaid program or CHIP. 
Given the weak evidence base 
underlying sex-rejecting procedures for 
children and the potential risk of harm, 
including long-term harm, we believe 
this proposed rule appropriately 
implements the directives to States 
under sections 1902(a)(19) and 
1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act that care and 
treatment provided under Medicaid 
must be in the best interests of 
recipients, and that payment for services 
must be consistent with quality of care. 
C. Prohibition on CHIP Payment for Sex- 
Rejecting Procedures 
We propose to revise subpart D in 42 
CFR part 457 to prohibit Federal CHIP 
payments to States for sex-rejecting 
procedures provided to children. The 
purpose of this section is to ensure that 
CHIP is operated in an effective and 
efficient manner that is coordinated 
with other sources of health benefits 
coverage, including Medicaid, for 
children consistent with section 2101(a) 
of the Act by prohibiting Federal 
financial participation in payments by

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with PROPOSALS159456 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Proposed Rules States for sex-rejecting procedures for a 
child under the age of 19. This would 
create consistency between CHIP 
coverage and Medicaid. 
The prohibition on Federal financial 
participation for payments by States for 
sex-rejecting procedures for children 
applies in the same manner described in 
Medicaid at § 441.802 to a State 
administering a separate CHIP except 
that it applies to children under the age 
of 19 in accordance with the definition 
of a targeted low-income child at 
§ 457.310. This prohibition applies to 
CHIP regardless of the type of health 
benefit coverage option described at 
§ 457.410. The definitions applied 
under Medicaid at § 441.801 apply 
equally to a separate CHIP. 
We believe that our proposed 
prohibition of Federal CHIP payment for 
sex-rejecting procedures is necessary 
given the need to align CHIP coverage 
with coverage of these services in 
Medicaid, the lack of scientific evidence 
regarding the effectiveness of these 
treatments, and the significant potential 
for negative and often irreversible side 
effects when used for the purposes 
included in our proposed definition in 
children. 
For each of these provisions outlined 
previously in this proposed rule, we 
anticipate stopping the Federal 
reimbursement of sex-rejecting 
procedures immediately upon the 
effective date of the rule finalizing these 
provisions, for both Medicaid and CHIP. 
III. Collection of Information 
Requirements 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501–3520, we 
are required to provide notice in the 
Federal Register and solicit public 
comment before a ‘‘collection of 
information’’ requirement is submitted 
to the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) for review and approval. 
Collection of information is defined 
under 5 CFR 1320.3(c) of the PRA’s 
implementing regulations. 
To fairly evaluate whether an 
information collection should be 
approved by OMB, 44 U.S.C. 
3506(c)(2)(A) requires that we solicit 
comment on the following issues: 
€The need for the information collection and its usefulness in carrying 
out the proper functions of our agency. 
€The accuracy of our estimate of the information collection burden. 
€The quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected. 
€Recommendations to minimize the information collection burden on the 
affected public, including automated 
collection techniques. 
We are soliciting public comment on 
each of these issues for the following 
sections of this document that contain 
information collection requirements. 
Comments, if received, will be 
responded to within the subsequent 
final rule (CMS–2451–F, RIN 0938– 
AV73), if this proposed rule is finalized. 
A. Wage Estimates 
To derive average costs, we used data 
from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 
May 2024 National Occupational 
Employment and Wage Statistics for all 
salary estimates (https://www.bls.gov/ 
oes/tables.htm). In this regard, Table 1 
presents BLS’ mean hourly wage, our 
estimated cost of fringe benefits and 
other indirect costs (calculated at 100 
percent of salary), and our adjusted 
hourly wage.

employee hourly wage estimates by a 
factor of 100 percent. This is necessarily 
a rough adjustment, both because fringe 
benefits and other indirect costs vary 
significantly from employer to 
employer, and because methods of 
estimating these costs vary widely from 
study to study. Nonetheless, we believe 
that doubling the hourly wage to 
estimate the total cost is a reasonably 
accurate estimation method. 
B. Proposed Information Collection 
Requirements (ICRs) 
1. ICRs Regarding Definitions 
(§ 441.801) 
We anticipate that the proposed 
definitions (adding and defining 
‘‘female’’, ‘‘male’’, ‘‘sex’’, and ‘‘sex- 
rejecting procedure’’) may result in the 
need for some States to amend existing 
policy/manual documents where those 
items are inconsistent with the 
parameters of this proposed rule. 
However, we do not anticipate that this 
would impact any active claims/billing 
forms or their instructions. 
We estimate a potential of 56 
Medicaid respondents and 56 CHIP 
respondents consisting of 50 States, the 
District of Colombia, American Samoa, 
Commonwealth of the Mariana Islands, 
Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin 
Islands. Based on research discussed in 
section I.1.C. (United States’ State Bans 
of and Coverage of Sex-Rejecting 
Procedures) of this proposed rule, 
approximately 27 States and one 
Territory have laws enacted restricting 
some or all of the sex-rejecting 
procedures that would be covered by this proposed rule. For these States and 
Territories, we do not anticipate State 
staff will need to conduct a review of 
policy documents for Medicaid or CHIP 
as these procedures are currently 
banned (or will be banned). 
For the remainder of States and 
Territories, we assume that State staff 
will conduct a review for both Medicaid 
policy documents and CHIP policy 
documents. As a result, we estimate 28 
States and Territories that would need 
to amend their existing policy 
documents consistent with these 
definitions. We estimate it will take 3 
hours at $87.52/hr for a Business 
Operations Specialist to review existing 
State policy documents to ensure 
consistency with the proposed 
definitions and 1 hour at $128.00/hr for 
a General and Operations Manager to 
review and approve the necessary State 
policy document changes. 
In aggregate we estimate a one-time 
State burden of 112 hours (28 States × 
4 hr/response) at a cost of $10,936 [(3 
hr × $87.52/hr × 28 States) + (1 hr × $128.00/hr × 28 States)]. When taking into account the Federal administrative 
match of 50 percent, we estimate a one- 
time State cost of $5,468 ($10,936 * 0.5). 
We assumed all services meeting the 
proposed definition would no longer be 
covered by Medicaid nor CHIP, and thus 
not eligible for Federal matching funds.

which includes the publication of 60- 
and 30-day Federal Register notices. In 
the meantime, the following scores the 
potential impact for preparing and 
submitting the SPA. We will revisit 
these preliminary estimates during the 
standard PRA process and revise if 
needed. 
Under the proposed provision, States 
and Territories would be required to 
submit SPAs specifically indicating 
adherence to the prohibition on 
claiming Federal funding of sex- 
rejecting procedures for individuals 
under the age of 18 for Medicaid and for 
individuals under the age of 19 for 
CHIP. The content of the SPA would be 
a simple recitation of the prohibition. 
As indicated above, the template will be 
made available for public review and 
comment if this proposed rule is 
finalized. We intend to require all States 
and Territories to submit this template 
for approval as part of their State plan. 
We estimate a potential of 56 
Medicaid and CHIP respondents 
consisting of 50 States, the District of 
Colombia, American Samoa, 
Commonwealth of the Mariana Islands, 
Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin 
Islands. We estimate it will take 2 hours 
at $87.52/hr for a Business Operations 
Specialist to prepare an initial SPA and 
1 hour at $128.00/hr for a General and 
Operations Manager to review and 
approve the SPA for submission to 
CMS. 
In aggregate, we estimate a one-time 
State burden of 168 hours (56 States × 
3 hr/response) at a cost of $16,970 [(2 
hr × $87.52/hr × 56 States) + (1 hr × $128.00/hr × 56 States)]. When taking into account the Federal administrative 
match of 50 percent, we estimate a one- 
time State cost of $8,485 ($16,970 * 0.5). 
We assumed all services meeting the 
proposed definition would no longer be 
covered by Medicaid nor CHIP, and thus 
not eligible for Federal matching funds.

this preamble, and, when we proceed 
with a subsequent document, we will 
respond to the comments in the 
preamble to that document. 
V. Regulatory Impact Statement 
A. Statement of Need 
Throughout the U.S., thousands of 
children are receiving sex-rejecting 
procedures for the purpose of 
attempting to align their bodies with an 
asserted identity that differs from their 
sex. As outlined in this proposed rule, 
however, the current medical evidence 
does not support conclusively these 
interventions and indicates that they 
might lack clear benefits while posing a 
health and safety risk to children. To 
help ensure that Medicaid services are 
provided in a manner consistent with 
the best interests of the recipients and 
that Medicaid payments are consistent 
with quality of care, we are proposing 
a prohibition on State Medicaid 
Agencies from providing payment under 
the plan for sex-rejecting procedures for 
children under the age of 18 and 
proposing a prohibition on State CHIPs 
from providing payment under the plan 
for sex-rejecting procedures for children 
under the age of 19. 
B. Overall Impact 
We have examined the impacts of this 
proposed rule as required by Executive 
Order 12866, ‘‘Regulatory Planning and 
Review’’; Executive Order 13132, 
‘‘Federalism’’; Executive Order 13563, 
‘‘Improving Regulation and Regulatory 
Review’’; Executive Order 14192, 
‘‘Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation’’; the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (RFA) (Pub. L. 96–354); 
section 1102(b) of the Social Security 
Act; and section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 
104–4). 
Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 
direct agencies to assess all costs and 
benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select those regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, 
environmental, public health and safety, 
and other advantages; distributive 
impacts). Section 3(f) of Executive Order 
12866 defines a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ as any regulatory action that is 
likely to result in a rule that may: (1) 
have an annual effect on the economy 
of $100 million or more or adversely 
affect in a material way the economy, a 
sector of the economy, productivity, 
competition, jobs, the environment, 
public health or safety, or State, local, 
or Tribal governments or communities; 
(2) create a serious inconsistency or 
otherwise interfere with an action taken 
or planned by another agency; (3) 
materially alter the budgetary impact of 
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan

recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel 
legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, or the President’s priorities. 
A regulatory impact analysis (RIA) 
must be prepared for a regulatory action 
that is significant under section 3(f)(1) 
of E.O. 12866. Based on our estimates, 
the Office of Management and Budget’s 
(OMB) Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has 
determined this rulemaking is 
significant per section 3(f). Accordingly, 
we have prepared a Regulatory Impact 
Analysis that to the best of our ability 
presents the costs and benefits of the 
rulemaking. 
C. Detailed Economic Analysis 
1. Impacts on Federal Expenditures and 
Other Transfers 
We estimate that this proposal would 
reduce Federal Medicaid spending by 
about $188 million from fiscal year 2027 
through fiscal year 2036 (in real 2027 
dollars). To estimate the impact of this 
proposal, we analyzed data from T– 
MSIS TAF v8.0 for 2023. We selected all 
claims with a gender dysphoria 
diagnosis and in the following claims 
categories: inpatient hospital with 
surgical procedure; outpatient hospital 
with surgical procedure; and 
professional services and prescription 
drugs with hormone therapy. We 
included fee-for-service and managed 
care encounter data. We also analyzed 
this data by beneficiary age group and 
counted only spending for individuals 
ages 17 and younger. We note that the 
proposed policy would not prohibit 
payment by a State Medicaid agency for 
these services for those age 18, and 
those individuals and costs are not 
included as part of the estimates. This 
data also includes CHIP expenditures 
for these services. 
For 2023, we identified about $31 
million in total computable Medicaid 
and CHIP spending for these services 
and individuals. States that had not 
banned gender dysphoria treatments for 
children as of 2023 accounted for 76 
percent of spending, including 92 
percent of inpatient treatment with 
surgery and 87 percent of outpatient 
treatment with surgery.

Note: The T–MSIS data includes enrollment and spending by age groups, which includes ages 15–18 as one group. The policy in this pro-posed rule would only affect Medicaid enrollees under age 18 (ages 15–17), but the table above includes spending for individuals age 18. We 
note that we have adjusted for this when developing the estimates in the RIA. 
We projected this spending forward 
from 2023 through 2035 using projected 
growth in Medicaid and CHIP spending 
on children from the Mid-Session 
Review of the President’s fiscal year 
2026 Budget. We assumed all services 
would no longer be covered by 
Medicaid or CHIP, and thus not eligible 
for Federal matching funds. We solicit 
comment on whether states that 
currently cover services would continue 
to cover these services absent FFP as 
described in this proposed rulemaking. 
States that currently cover these 
services under Medicaid would see the 
largest reductions in Medicaid 
spending. We also assumed about 3 
percent of spending would be delayed 
until individuals reach age 18, reflecting 
50 percent of the surgical procedures 
being paid by Medicaid and CHIP in the 
future. Absent data or analysis on the 
impact of prohibitions on these 
procedures, we assumed some 
individuals would ultimately receive 
these services once eligible and believe 
50 percent is reasonable (considering 
that some individuals would no longer 
be eligible for Medicaid in the future 
and some individuals may find other 
sources of coverage). 
Table 4 shows the annual impact of 
the proposal on total and Federal 
Medicaid and CHIP spending in 
millions of dollars. These estimates 
assume the policies in the proposed rule 
would be effective as of October 1, 2026. 
Total Medicaid and CHIP spending 
would be reduced by $318 million over 
10 years, Federal spending would be 
reduced by $188 million, and State 
spending would be reduced by $130 
million (in real 2027 dollars). Actual 
impacts may vary from these estimates. 
We have relied on the most recently 
available program data for this analysis 
and projections of future enrollment and 
spending. Actual future costs may vary 
if enrollment and spending are higher or 
lower than projected.

assumptions about how individuals may 
use these services in the future. A 
greater or lesser number of individuals 
may still receive coverage for these 
services upon reaching age 18 than we 
have assumed. In addition, it is possible 
some individuals may find alternative 
coverage for these services (for example,

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with PROPOSALS159459 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Proposed Rules States covering services without Federal 
funding, or private insurance). We have 
also not estimated if there would be any 
other impacts on Federal expenditures 
(for example, increases in other 
healthcare services related to gender 
dysphoria). 
2. Costs 
In addition, the proposed rule may 
result in several costs. States would 
need to update State plans or waivers to 
comply with the proposed changes to 
covered benefits. Those impacts are 
described in section III. of this proposed 
rule. In addition, the changes in this 
proposed rule may prevent or delay 
individuals from receiving these 
healthcare services. 
3. Alternatives 
As an alternative to this proposed 
rule, we considered taking no action to 
require that a State Medicaid or CHIP 
plan must provide that the Medicaid or 
CHIP agency will not make payment 
under the plan for sex-rejecting 
procedures for children in Medicaid 
under the age of 18 and children in 
CHIP under the age of 19 and to prohibit 
the use of Federal Medicaid or CHIP 
dollars to fund sex-rejecting procedures 
for these individuals. On January 28, 
2025, President Trump issued E.O. 
14187, Protecting Children from 
Chemical and Surgical Mutilation. 
Section 5(a) of that order directs the 
Secretary to take all appropriate actions 
consistent with applicable law to end 
what the order refers to as the chemical 
and surgical mutilation of children 
including regulatory and sub-regulatory 
actions for specific programs, including 
Medicaid. In alignment with the 
Executive Order and the evidence 
outlined in section I.B. of this proposed 
rule, CMS decided to pursue this 
proposed policy. These proposed 
changes would not prevent States from 
providing coverage for sex-rejecting 
procedures with State-only funds 
outside of the Federally-matched 
Medicaid program or CHIP. 
D. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
The RFA requires agencies to analyze 
options for regulatory relief of small 
entities, if a rule has a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. For purposes 
of the RFA, we estimate that almost all 
hospitals and other healthcare providers 
are small entities as that term is used in 
the RFA (including small businesses, 
small nonprofit organizations, and small 
governmental jurisdictions). The great 
majority of hospitals and most other 
healthcare providers are small entities, 
either by being nonprofit organizations 
or by meeting the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) definition of a 
small business (having revenues of less 
than $9.0 million to $47.0 million in 
any 1 year). Individuals and States are 
not included in the definition of a small 
entity. 
For purposes of the RFA, 
approximately 96 percent of the health 
care industries impacted are considered 
small businesses according to the Small 
Business Administration’s size 
standards. According to the SBA’s 
website at http://www.sba.gov/content/ 
small-business-size-standards, the health care industries impacted fall in

Individuals and States are not 
included in the definition of a small 
entity. 
As shown in Table 12, all the 
industries combined, according to the 
2022 Economic Census, earned 
approximately $2,364,153,884,000, 
while the small firms for all the 
industries combined earned 
approximately $325,819,624,000. Table 
13 in section V.E. estimates a $31.6 
million reduction in total annualized 
monetized transfers from the Federal 
Government and States to health care 
providers. This total estimated 
reduction represents less than 1 percent 
of the total revenues of the health care 
industries impacted and the total 
revenues of the small firms in the health 
care industries impacted. It also 
represents less than 1 percent of the 
total revenues of each health care 
industry impacted and the total 
revenues of the small firms in each 
health care industry impacted. As a 
result, this proposed rule if finalized 
would result in a change in revenue of 
less than 1 percent for the impacted 
health care industries.

* Calculated using an estimated reduction in total annualized monetized transfers of $31.6 million (as shown in Table 13) as a percentage of 
total revenues. 
As its measure of significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities, 
HHS uses a change in revenue of more 
than 3 to 5 percent. According to Table 
12, we do not believe that the 3 to 5 
percent threshold will be reached by the 
proposed requirements in this rule for 
NAICS 446110 Pharmacies and Drug 
Stores; 622111 Offices of Physicians 
(except Mental Health Specialists); 
621112 Offices of Physicians, Mental 
Health Specialists; 621493 Freestanding 
Ambulatory Surgical and Emergency 
Centers; 621498 All Other Outpatient 
Care Centers; or 622110 General 
Medical and Surgical Hospitals. 
Therefore, the Secretary has certified 
that this proposed rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities in 
these industries. 
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act 
requires us to prepare a regulatory 
impact analysis RIA if a rule may have 
a significant impact on the operations of 
a substantial number of small rural 
hospitals. This analysis must conform to 
the provisions of section 603 of the 
RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of 
the Act, we define a small rural hospital 
as a hospital that is located outside of 
a Metropolitan Statistical Area for 
Medicare payment regulations and has 
fewer than 100 beds. We are not 
preparing an analysis for section 1102(b) 
of the Act because we have determined, 
and the Secretary certifies, that this 
proposed rule would not have a 
significant impact on the operations of 
a substantial number of small rural 
hospitals. 
Section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) 
also requires that agencies assess 
anticipated costs and benefits before 
issuing any rule whose mandates 
require spending in any 1 year of $100 
million in 1995 dollars, updated 
annually for inflation. In 2025, that 
threshold is approximately $187 
million. The proposed rule would not 
mandate significant spending costs on 
State, local, or Tribal governments in 
the aggregate, or by the private sector. 
Executive Order 13132 establishes 
certain requirements that an agency 
must meet when it issues a rule that 
imposes substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the 
National Government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. This proposed 
rule will have a substantial direct effect 
on the ability of States to receive 
Federal Medicaid funds for sex-rejecting 
procedures furnished to children under 
age 18 and on the ability of States to 
receive Federal CHIP funds for sex- 
rejecting procedures furnished to 
children under age 19. 
E. Accounting Statement and Table

(available at https://

have prepared an accounting statement 
in Table 13 showing the classification of 
the impact associated with the 
provisions of this proposed rule.

Sec. 
441.800 Basis and purpose. 
441.801 Definitions. 
441.802 General rules. 
§ 441.800 Basis and purpose. 
Basis and purpose. The purpose of 
this section is to implement sections 
1902(a)(19) and 1902(a)(30)(A) of the 
Act to protect Medicaid beneficiaries 
and ensure Medicaid payment is 
consistent with quality of care by 
prohibiting Federal financial 
participation in payments by States for 
sex-rejecting procedures for a child 
under the age of 18. 
(a) As relevant to this subpart, section 
1902(a)(19) of the Act requires that 
States ensure that care and services will 
be provided in a manner consistent with 
the best interests of the recipients. 
(b) As relevant to this subpart, section 
1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act requires that 
States’ payment methods be consistent 
with quality of care. 
§ 441.801 Definitions. 
As used in this subpart— 
FFP means Federal financial participation. 
Female means a person of the sex characterized by a reproductive system 
with the biological function of (at 
maturity, absent disruption or 
congenital anomaly) producing eggs 
(ova). 
Male means a person of the sex characterized by a reproductive system 
with the biological function of (at 
maturity, absent disruption or 
congenital anomaly) producing sperm. 
Sex means a person’s immutable biological classification as either male 
or female. 
Sex-rejecting procedure means, except 
as specified in paragraph (3) of this 
definition, any pharmaceutical or 
surgical intervention that attempts to 
align a child’s physical appearance or 
body with an asserted identity that 
differs from the child’s sex by either of 
the following: 
(1) Intentionally disrupting or 
suppressing the normal development of 
natural biological functions, including 
primary or secondary sex-based traits; or 
(2) Intentionally altering a child’s 
physical appearance or body, including 
amputating, minimizing or destroying 
primary or secondary sex-based traits 
such as the sexual and reproductive 
organs. 
(3) For purposes of this definition, the 
term sex-rejecting procedure does not include procedures undertaken— 
(i) To treat a child with a medically 
verifiable disorder of sexual 
development; or 
(ii) For purposes other than 
attempting to align a child’s physical 
appearance or body with an asserted 
identity that differs from the child’s sex; 
or. 
(iii) To treat complications, including 
any infection, injury, disease, or 
disorder that has been caused by or 
exacerbated by the performance of sex- 
rejecting procedure(s). 
§ 441.802 General rules. 
(a) A State plan must provide that the 
Medicaid agency will not make payment 
under the plan for sex-rejecting 
procedures for children under the age of 
18. 
(b) FFP is not available in State 
expenditures for sex-rejecting 
procedures for children under the age of 
18. 
PART 457—ALLOTMENTS AND 
GRANTS TO STATES 
3. The authority citation for part 457 
continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1302. 4. Section 457.476 is added to subpart 
D to read as follows: 
§ 457.476 Limitations on coverage: Sex- 
rejecting procedures. 
(a) Basis and purpose. The purpose of 
this section is to ensure that CHIP is 
operated in an effective and efficient 
manner that is coordinated with other 
sources of health benefits coverage, 
including Medicaid, for children 
consistent with 2101(a) by prohibiting 
Federal financial participation in 
payments by States for sex-rejecting 
procedures for a child under the age of 
19. 
(b) The prohibition on Federal 
financial participation for payments by 
States for sex-rejecting procedures for 
children applies in the same manner 
described in Medicaid at § 441.802 to a 
State administering a separate CHIP 
except that it applies to children under 
the age of 19 in accordance with the 
definition of a targeted low-income 
child at § 457.310. This prohibition 
applies to CHIP regardless of the type of 
health benefit coverage option described 
at § 457.410. For purposes of this 
section, the definitions applied under 
Medicaid at § 441.801 apply equally to 
a separate CHIP.

I. Background 
On January 28, 2025, President Trump 
signed Executive Order (E.O.) 14187 
‘‘Protecting Children from Chemical and 
Surgical Mutilation.’’
1
In particular, 
Section 5(a) of the order directs the 
Secretary of HHS consistent with 
applicable law to ‘‘take all appropriate 
actions to end the chemical and surgical 
mutilation of children, including 
regulatory and subregulatory actions, 
which may involve [. . .]: Medicare or 
Medicaid conditions of participation or 
conditions for coverage.’’ CMS has 
developed this proposed rule in 
compliance with this E.O. As further 
discussed in this proposed rule, we 
describe CMS’ statutory authority 
related to patient health and safety 
standards (known as Medicare 
‘‘Conditions of Participation’’ (CoPs), 
‘‘Conditions for Coverage’’ (CfCs), or 
simply ‘‘Requirements’’), summarize 
data on the rise of sex-rejecting 
procedures (SRPs) on children, review 
the latest information on SRPs in 
children as described in the HHS 
Review (the Review), provide an 
overview of State laws, as well as prior 
CMS actions on this topic. We propose 
to add a new section to 42 CFR part 482, 
subpart C that would prohibit Medicare- 
participating hospitals from performing 
sex-rejecting procedures (SRPs) on any 
child (§ 482.46(a)). 
A. Statutory Authority 
CMS has broad statutory authority 
under the Social Security Act (the Act) 
to establish health and safety 
regulations, which includes the 
authority to establish requirements that 
protect the health and safety of children. 
Section 1861(e)(9) of the Act, applicable 
to hospitals that participate in the 
Medicare program, explicitly gives CMS 
the authority to enact regulations that 
the Secretary finds necessary in the 
interest of the health and safety of 
individuals who are furnished services 
in a hospital, while section 1871 of the 
Act gives CMS the authority to prescribe 
regulations as necessary to carry out the 
administration of the program. Under 
this authority, the Secretary has 
established regulatory requirements that 
a hospital must meet to participate in 
Medicare at 42 CFR part 482, entitled 
‘‘Conditions of Participation’’ for 
Hospitals. Section 1905(a) of the statute 
provides that Medicaid payments from 
States may be applied to hospital 
services. Under regulations at 
§§ 440.10(a)(3)(iii) and 440.20(a)(3)(ii), 
hospitals that provide inpatient and 
outpatient services, respectively, to 
Medicaid enrollees are required to meet 
the Medicare CoPs to also participate in 
Medicaid. In this way, the CoPs regulate 
the safety of all patients in a facility that 
is subject to 42 CFR part 482, regardless 
of payor (for example, Medicare, 
Medicaid, private insurance, and self- 
pay). 
The CoPs for hospitals include 
specific, process-oriented requirements 
for certain hospital services or 
departments. The purposes of these 
conditions are to protect patient health 
and safety and to ensure that quality 
care is furnished to all patients in 
Medicare-participating hospitals.

Interventions for Children as Part of 
Sex-Rejecting Procedures for Gender 
Dysphoria 
Gender dysphoria is a condition 
defined by the American Psychiatric 
Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–5– 
TR) as a ‘‘marked incongruence between 
one’s experienced/expressed gender and 
assigned gender’’ that ‘‘must also be 
associated with clinically significant 
distress or impairment in social, 
occupational, or other important areas 
of functioning.’’
23
Over the past decade, 
increasing numbers of children have 
been diagnosed with gender dysphoria 
and been treated with SRPs.
45
SRPs can 
encompass a range of hormonal and 
surgical interventions: pharmacological 
interventions including puberty 
blocking medications to delay the onset 
of puberty, cross-sex hormone therapy 
to promote secondary sexual

CMS calculation: The annual number of overall 
SRPs (Breast/chest surgery, genital surgery, and 
other cosmetic procedures) on children aged 12 to 
18 years is 740. The annual estimated number of 
children aged 12 to 18 according to U.S, Census 
Bureau data is 29,600,770. This results in annual 
estimate of 2.17 chest/breast procedures per 
100,000 children aged 12 to 18 ((643/29,600,770) × 
100,000 =2.50)). This calculation assumes 1 SRP per 
person.

CMS calculation: The annual number of breast/ 
chest surgeries on children aged 12 to 18 years is 
643. The annual estimated number of children aged 
12 to 18 according to U.S, Census Bureau data is 
29,600,770. This results in annual estimate of 2.17 
breast/chest surgeries per 100,000 children aged 12

CMS calculation: The annual number of genital 
surgeries on children aged 12 to 18 years is 81. The 
annual estimated number of children aged 12 to 18 
according to U.S. Census Bureau data is 29,600,770. 
This results in annual estimate of 0.27 genital 
procedures per 100,000 children aged 12 to 18 ((81/ 
29,600,770) × 100,000 =0.27)). This calculation assumes 1 genital surgery is done per person.

CMS calculation: Per the article, the highest 
rate of hormone treatment occurs at age 17 with 140 
AFAB adolescents (assigned female at birth) 
receiving testosterone (per 100,000 is 0.14% (140/ 
100,000) ×100=0.14%)) and 82 AMAB adolescents (assigned male at birth) receiving estrogen (per 
100,000 is 0.082% (82/100,000) ×100 =0.082%). 
This results in 222 (82+140= 222) per 100,000 or 
0.222 (0.14% + 0.082% = 0.222). This calculation 
assumes 1 sex rejecting hormone treatment is done 
per person.

characteristics associated with the 
opposite biological sex, and surgical 
procedures (such as chest/breast and 
genital surgery).
67
 
The recorded prevalence of SRPs for 
children with gender dysphoria varies 
across sources. A study published in 
2023 estimated that between 2016 and 
2020, nearly 3,700 children aged 12 to 
18 years old diagnosed with gender 
dysphoria underwent SRPs (2.50 per 
100,000),
8
including an estimated 3,200 
chest/breast procedures (2.17 per 
100,000)
9
and 400 genital surgeries 
(0.27 per 100,000).
10 11
Another study 
documented that almost 0.2 percent (or 
almost 2 in every 1,000) of 17-year- 
olds
12
with private insurance received 
SRP hormone treatment between 2018 
through 2022.
13 14
 
While Medicare does not pay for a 
significant number of SRP procedures 
for children, we conclude that, based on 
the previously cited data, hospitals that 
participate in Medicare perform a 
considerable number of these 
procedures every year. We further note 
that the Medicare hospital CoPs apply to 
hospitals providing services to patients 
receiving Medicaid covered services 
((§§ 440.10(a)(3)(iii) and 
440.20(a)(3)(ii)). Approximately half of 
U.S. children receive health care 
through Medicaid. 
2. Medical Evidence Regarding Sex- 
Rejecting Procedures in Children 
The rising numbers of children 
seeking and receiving SRPs in recent 
years
15
has spurred ongoing debates 
regarding the safety and efficacy of these 
interventions. 
a. The HHS Review 
In compliance with Executive Order 
(E.O.) 14187, ‘‘Protecting Children from 
Chemical and Surgical Mutilation’’
16
 
signed on January 28, 2025 (as 
discussed previously in this proposed 
rule), HHS released a preliminary 
comprehensive review of the evidence 
and best practices for treating pediatric 
gender dysphoria on May 1, 2025.
17
On 
November 19, 2025, HHS published a 
final version following the conclusion of 
a peer review process.
18
the Review 
provides an overview of systematic 
reviews—also known as an ‘‘umbrella 
review’’—to evaluate the evidence of the 
benefits and harms of SRPs in children. 
Several existing systematic reviews of 
evidence that have informed health 
authorities in Europe were assessed for 
methodological quality. 
The Review itself does not provide 
clinical or policy recommendations. 
Instead, it analyzes evidence and best 
practices for children experiencing 
gender dysphoria. The Review also 
contains an ethics review that applies 
widely accepted principles of medical 
ethics to the practice of SRPs in 
children.
19
Accordingly, the Review 
states: 
‘‘As demonstrated throughout this 
Review, the presuppositions that guide 
[pediatric medical transition (PMT)] 
have not been shown to be valid; the 
nature, probability and magnitude of 
risks associated with PMT have not 
been distinguished with sufficient 
clarity; PMT proponents’ estimates of 
the probability of harm and benefit have 
not been shown to be reasonable, as 
judged by known facts and available 
studies; and the risks of serious 
impairment that PMT involves have not 
been shown to be justified. For these 
reasons, administering PMT to 
adolescents, even in a research context, 
is in tension with well-established 
ethical norms for human subjects 
research.’’
20
 
The Review (as further discussed in 
Section I.B.c. of this proposed rule) 
provides evidence of the clinical 
realities of SRPs in the United States, 
documenting the abandonment of 
medical guardrails. For example, the 
Review highlights how a protocol 
establishing SRPs in minors originated 
in the Netherlands and quickly spread 
to other Western countries without 
rigorous testing, and was codified in 
medical guidelines, which later did 
away with some of their already 
contested safeguards.
21
The Endocrine 
Society (ES) incorporated puberty 
blockers and hormones into their 2009 
and 2017 clinical practice guidelines, 
recommending hormonal interventions 
for certain pediatric patients with 
gender dysphoria while also 
acknowledging the lack of reliable 
evidence for these treatments.
22
ES 
justified this recommendation in a 
‘‘values and preferences’’ statement that 
places a higher priority on ‘‘avoiding 
a[n] unsatisfactory physical outcome 
when secondary sex characteristics have

23
 
The World Professional Association 
for Transgender Health (WPATH) 
endorsed a similar approach and most 
recently recommend these in their 
Standards of Care, Version 8 (SOC–8).
24
 
However, as carefully documented in 
the Review, the creation of SOC–8 
marked ‘‘a clear departure from the 
principles of unbiased, evidence-driven 
clinical guideline development.’’
25
The 
HHS Review cites court documents 
containing internal WPATH 
communications used when developing 
SOC–8 that show WPATH suppressed 
systematic reviews of evidence after 
learning that these reviews would not 
support its preferred medical approach. 
WPATH also failed to manage conflicts 
of interest and eliminated age 
minimums for hormones and most 
surgeries due to political pressures.
26
A 
recent systematic review of 
international guidelines did not 
recommend either the WPATH or ES 
guidelines for clinical use after 
determining they ‘‘lack developmental 
rigour and transparency.’’
27
 
b. International Reviews of SRPs in 
Children 
The Review also describes practice 
reversals in several European countries 
(Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, 
United Kingdom) following systematic 
reviews of evidence. 
In 2020, Finland’s Council for Choices 
in Health Care, a monitoring agency for 
the country’s public health services, 
issued guidelines stating that ‘‘gender 
reassignment of minors is an 
experimental practice.’’ While not 
banning SRPs outright, the guidelines 
state ‘‘based on studies examining 
gender identity in minors, hormonal 
interventions [puberty blockers, 
hormone therapy] may be considered 
before reaching adulthood in those with 
firmly established transgender 
identities, but it must be done with a 
great deal of caution, and no irreversible 
treatment should be initiated.’’
28
For 
children with gender dysphoria prior to 
and worsening at the onset of puberty, 
the report recommends that ‘‘puberty 
suppression treatment [that is, puberty 
blockers] may be initiated on a case-by- 
case basis after careful consideration 
and appropriate diagnostic 
examinations if the medical indications 
for the treatment are present and there 
are no contraindications.’’ This is 
similar to past recommendations, and as 
before, these treatments would be 
limited to research settings for payment 
by the nation’s health service. For 
children with gender dysphoria that 
have undergone puberty, the guidelines 
recommend that decisions regarding 
initiation of hormone treatment that 
alter sex characteristics be ‘‘based on 
thorough, case-by-case consideration, 
[. . .] [and] only if it can be ascertained 
that their identity as the other sex is of 
a permanent nature and causes severe 
dysphoria [. . .] and that no 
contraindications [that is, mental health 
conditions] are present.’’ Previously, 
recommendations noted that hormone 
therapy should not begin before age 16 
in this group and that patients under 18 
may receive 3 to 6 months of puberty 
blockers prior to beginning hormone 
therapy. The current report mentions no 
age or month specific treatment 
guidelines. The report continues to 
recommend that all such interventions 
be done in a research setting. The report 
adds that ‘‘[i]nformation about the 
potential harms of hormone therapies is 
accumulating slowly and is not 
systematically reported’’ and calls for 
further rigorous research of the benefits 
and risks of these treatments. Consistent 
with past recommendations, the report 
adds that ‘‘surgical treatments are not 
part of the treatment methods for 
dysphoria caused by gender-related 
conflicts in minors.’’
29
 
In 2022, Sweden’s National Board of 
Health and Welfare (NBHW) reviewed 
and updated its guidelines for treatment 
of children with gender dysphoria.
30 31
 
At the population level, NBHW issued 
‘‘weak, negative recommendation as 
guidance to the healthcare system’’ that 
the risks of hormone treatment (which 
included gonadotropin releasing 
hormones (GnRH) also known as 
puberty blockers) and mastectomy likely 
outweigh the expected benefits for most 
adolescents. NBHW concludes that 
‘‘existing scientific evidence is 
insufficient for assessing the effects of 
puberty suppressing and gender- 
affirming hormone therapy on gender 
dysphoria, psychosocial health and 
quality of life of adolescents with 
gender dysphoria.’’ While not banning 
access to SRPs, NBHW suggests 
restricting such treatments to 
exceptional circumstances or research 
settings, and adhering to the original 
‘‘Dutch protocol’’ criteria including 
‘‘existence of the incongruence since 
childhood, the stability of gender 
identity over time, clear distress caused 
by the onset of puberty, and the absence 
of factors that complicate the diagnostic 
assessment.’’
32
The report did not 
discuss SRP surgeries aside from 
mastectomy. 
In the United Kingdom, the National 
Health Service (NHS) commissioned a 
comprehensive review of the existing 
literature on SRPs and the prevailing 
service model. The 4-year independent 
evaluation of pediatric gender medicine 
(PGM), known as the ‘‘Cass Review,’’ 
was published by Dr. Hilary Cass in 
April 2024. The Cass review concluded 
that the evidence base for SRPs in 
children is ‘‘remarkably weak’’ and 
recommended restructuring of the 
service model towards prioritization of 
psychotherapy.
33
 
In terms of research quality, the Cass 
Review notes that the number of studies 
on gender dysphoria treatment in 
children is very low, with small study 
sizes that have inconsistent metrics, low

The American Academy of Pediatrics’ (AAP) 
2018 Policy Statement was reaffirmed in 2023 
(Rafferty et al., 2018); the Endocrine Society’s (ES) 
published in 2017 represents the most recent 
published version (Hembree et al., 2017); the World 
Professional Association for Transgender Health’s 
(WPATH) most recent clinical practice guideline is 
Continued 
quality methods (uncontrolled 
observational studies), results of low 
certainty, and lack of longitudinal data 
(that is, do not follow youth into 
adulthood; average duration of hormone 
treatment is between 1 year and 5.8 
years). The Cass Review notes that this 
weak evidence base makes conclusions 
regarding the benefits versus risk of 
gender dysphoria treatment in children 
extremely difficult to assess. The Cass 
Review also critiques WPATH 
guidelines, noting that WPATH’s own 
systemic review acknowledges a high 
risk of bias in study designs, small 
sample sizes, and confounding 
variables. 
Regarding guideline development, the 
Cass Review notes that most current 
guidelines have not followed the 
international standards for guideline 
development, including the WPATH 
guidelines. As such, the Cass Review 
only recommends two guidelines: the 
Finnish guideline (2020) and the 
Swedish guideline (2022) as discussed 
above. However, the Cass Review notes 
that even these guidelines lack clear 
recommendations regarding certain 
aspects of practice and ‘‘would be of 
benefit if they provided more detailed 
guidance on how to implement 
recommendations.’’ 
While not banning access to puberty 
blockers, Dr. Cass concluded in a July 
2023 letter that ‘‘because of the potential 
risks to neurocognitive development, 
psychosexual development and longer- 
term bone health, [puberty blockers] 
should only be offered under a research 
protocol [for treatment of pediatric 
gender dysphoria].’’ NHS England and 
National Institute for Health and Care 
Research (NIHR) have enacted this 
recommendation as of December 2024. 
Exceptions are permitted for non-gender 
dysphoria-related medical conditions 
(i.e. precocious puberty) and for those patients already on treatment.
34
For 
hormone interventions, the Cass Review 
highlights a lack of high-quality 
research assessing the (long-term) 
outcomes of hormone interventions in 
children with gender dysphoria. Given 
this weak evidence base, Dr. Cass notes 
that ‘‘no conclusions can be drawn 
about the effect [of hormone 
interventions] on gender dysphoria, 
body satisfaction, psychosocial health, 
cognitive development, or fertility. 
Uncertainty remains about the outcomes 
for height/growth, cardiometabolic and 
bone health.’’ the Cass Review 
ultimately calls for caution, better 
research (prospective studies with long- 
term outcome data), honest 
communication with patients about the 
limitations of current knowledge, and 
development of evidence-based 
guidelines that acknowledge the 
limitations of current evidence. Of note, 
in the United Kingdom, children have 
never received gender dysphoria related 
surgery as paid by the NHS; Cass 
therefore did not systemically review 
evidence for gender dysphoria related 
surgeries in children. 
Norway and Denmark are exploring or 
have enacted similar restrictions, 
though neither have issued direct bans 
of SRPs. In 2023, the Norwegian 
Commission for the Investigation of 
Health Care Services (Ukom), an 
independent State-owned agency, made 
recommendations on the treatment for 
youth with gender dysphoria.
35
The 
recommendations consisted of: defining 
SRPs (that is, puberty blockers, 
hormonal therapies, and surgical 
treatment) as ‘‘experimental treatment,’’ 
revising national guidelines based on a 
systematic knowledge summary, and 
consideration for a national registry to 
improve quality and reduce variation in 
patient treatment.While not banning 
access to SRPs, Norway’s public health 
authorityhas signaled an intention 
torespond to UKOM’s concerns with an 
adjustment to the current treatment 
guidelines.
36
While also not banning 
access to SRPs, Denmark has also taken 
a cautious approach to hormone 
interventions (that is, puberty blockers 
and cross-sex hormones) pending more 
evidence of its beneficial effects 
becoming available.
37
Notably, Denmark 
does not offer surgical treatment to 
children with gender dysphoria before 
age 18 as paid for by its national health 
service.
38
Other countries that have 
considered or restricted various gender 
dysphoria treatments for children 
include Italy,
39
Brazil,
40
New Zealand,
41
 
and Australia.

c. Medical Professional Societies 
Supporting SRPs 
We are aware that major medical 
organizations
43
(including the 
American Medical Association 
(AMA),
44
the American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP),
45
and the American 
Psychological Association
46 47
) have 
issued statements supporting access to 
SRPs, including for children. The most 
influential sources of clinical guidance 
for treating pediatric gender dysphoria 
in the U.S. are the WPATH and the ES 
clinical practice guidelines and the AAP 
guidance document.

the HHS Review that discusses the 
conclusions of a recent systematic 
review of international guideline quality 
by researchers at the University of York 
(the York Appraisal) that found all three 
documents are very low quality and 
should not be implemented.
49
 
As the HHS Review notes regarding 
the role of medical organizations in the 
treatment of pediatric gender medicine: 
‘‘U.S. medical associations played a 
key role in creating a perception that 
there is professional consensus in 
support of pediatric medical transition. 
This apparent consensus, however, is 
driven primarily by a small number of 
specialized committees, influenced by 
WPATH. It is not clear that the official 
views of these associations are shared 
by the wider medical community, or 
even by most of their members. There is 
evidence that some medical and mental 
health associations have suppressed 
dissent and stifled debate about this 
issue among their members.’’
50
 
The Endocrine Society (ES) issued 
clinical practice guidelines in 2017 
entitled ‘‘Endocrine Treatment of 
Gender-Dysphoric/Gender-Incongruent 
Persons.’’
51
As the HHS Review notes: 
‘‘In WPATH and ES guidelines, the 
principal goal of CSH administration is 
to induce physical characteristics 
typical of the opposite sex. When 
hormone levels rise beyond the typical 
reference range for a person’s sex, they 
are considered supraphysiologic. ES 
guidelines suggest that the sex an 
individual identifies as—as opposed to 
their biological sex—should determine 
the target reference range for hormonal 
concentrations. Critics have argued that 
perceived identity does not alter 
physiological processes and that such a 
belief can result in inappropriate and 
potentially dangerous hormone 
dosing.’’
52
 
The HHS Review states: 
‘‘The ES 2017 guideline, which used 
the GRADE [Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, 
Development and Evaluation] 
framework, has been criticized for 
making strong recommendations for 
hormonal interventions in the setting of 
a weak evidence base. Notably, none of 
the systematic reviews that supported 
the ES guidelines were based on 
outcomes for children or adolescents. 
The ES recommendation to initiate 
puberty blockade using gonadotropin- 
releasing hormone agonists was derived 
by putting a higher value on achieving 
a ‘‘satisfactory physical appearance’’ 
while putting the lowest value on 
avoiding physical harms. The ES 
recommendation for the initiation of 
cross-sex hormones no earlier than age 
16 was justified by placing a higher 
value on adolescent’s purported ability 
to meaningfully consent to cross-sex 
hormones (CSH) and placing a lower 
value on avoiding harm from potentially 
prolonged pubertal suppression.’’
53
 
As explained in Chapter 9 of HHS 
Review, the guidelines issued by the 
World Professional Association for 
Transgender Health (WPATH) ‘‘have 
been rated among the lowest in quality 
and have not been recommended for 
implementation by systematic reviews 
(SRs) of guidelines.’’
54
As the HHS 
Review points out: ‘‘Despite their lack of 
trustworthiness, for more than a decade 
WPATH guidelines have served as the 
foundation of the healthcare 
infrastructure for gender dysphoric (GD) 
youth in the United States. The WPATH 
Standards of Care guidelines are 
embedded in nearly all aspects of 
healthcare including clinical education, 
delivery of care, and reimbursement 
decisions by private and public 
insurers.’’
55
In 2022, WPATH issued 
guidelines entitled ‘‘Standards of Care 
for the Health of Transgender and 
Gender Diverse People, Version 8’’ 
(SOC–8).
56
These guidelines relaxed 
eligibility criteria for children to access 
sex-rejecting procedures and ultimately 
recommends that adolescents wishing to 
undergo sex-rejecting procedures 
receive them. Besides the problems 
identified in systematic reviews of 
international guidelines, as the HHS 
Review states, ‘‘in the process of 
developing SOC–8, WPATH suppressed 
systematic reviews its leaders believed 
would undermine its favored treatment 
approach. SOC–8 developers also 
violated conflict of interest management 
requirements and eliminated nearly all 
recommended age minimums for 
medical and surgical interventions in 
response to political pressures.’’
57
The 
HHS Review goes on to explain: ‘‘The 
recommendations are couched in 
cautious-sounding language, stating that 
GD should be ‘‘sustained over time,’’ 
particularly before administering CSH. 
However, no clear standard is set; the 
only guidance offered is the vague and 
clinically meaningless phrase ‘‘several 
years’’, leaving critical decisions open to 
broad and subjective interpretation.
58
 
Regarding the WPATH guidelines, the 
HHS review states: 
‘‘On the surface, WPATH SOC–8 
might appear to recommend a cautious 
approach toward assessment. Mental 
health providers are to conduct a 
‘‘comprehensive biopsychosocial 
assessment’’ prior to initiating medical 
interventions in order ‘‘to understand 
the adolescent’s strengths, 
vulnerabilities, diagnostic profile, and 
unique needs to individualize their 
care.’’
59
At the same time, however, 
WPATH recommends that clinicians use 
the International Classification of 
Diseases (ICD–11) diagnosis of ‘‘Gender 
Incongruence of Adolescence and 
Adulthood,’’ which, unlike the DSM–5 
diagnosis of ‘‘Gender Dysphoria,’’ 
requires only ‘‘marked and persistent 
incongruence between an individual’s 
experienced gender and the assigned 
sex.’’
60
Because SOC–8 defines 
transgender in a similar way (‘‘people 
whose gender identities and/or gender 
expressions are not what is typically

61
 
While AMA and the AAP have not 
issued their own treatment guidelines, 
they support the ES and WPATH 
guidelines, as discussed previously in 
this proposed rule. AAP issued a policy 
statement in 2018 supporting the use of 
puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, 
and surgeries for minors.
62
In support of 
sex-rejecting surgeries, AAP stated that 
while ‘‘current protocols [(ES, WPATH)] 
typically reserve surgical interventions 
for adults, they are occasionally pursued 
during adolescence on a case-by-case 
basis, considering the necessity and 
benefit to the adolescent’s overall health 
and often including multidisciplinary 
input from medical, mental health, and 
surgical providers as well as from the 
adolescent and family.’’ The AAP 
reaffirmed its policy statement in 2023 
but also stated that it was conducting its 
own review of the evidence and 
guideline development—which still has 
not been released.
63
 
Regarding the AAP policy statement, 
the HHS Review states: 
‘‘The AAP 2018 policy statement is 
not technically a CPG [clinical practice 
guideline] but has been widely cited in 
the U.S. as influential in establishing 
how pediatricians respond to children 
and adolescents with GD [gender 
dysphoria].
64
Because the document 
offers extensive clinical 
recommendations regarding every step 
of PMT—from social transition to PBs 
[puberty blockers], CSH [cross-sex 
hormones], and surgery—the York team 
assessed the trustworthiness of the AAP 
guidance using the same criteria they 
applied to CPGs. Using the AGREE II 
criteria, the AAP policy statement 
received the second-lowest average 
score among all international 
guidelines: 2 out of 7. As noted in 
Chapter 2, the AAP policy statement’s 
use of ‘‘gender diverse’’ casts a very 
wide net regarding which patients the 
organization considers eligible for 
medical intervention. The statement has 
been heavily criticized in peer-reviewed 
articles, which have pointed out that it 
is rife with referencing errors and 
inaccurate citations. Despite persistent 
advocacy among its members, who have 
petitioned the organization to release 
updated, evidence-based guidance for 
treating pediatric GD, the organization 
chose to reaffirm their policy statement 
in 2023.’’
65
 
We solicit comment of any published 
peer-reviewed findings that measure the 
effects of restrictions similar to those in 
this proposed rule on insurers, 
providers, and patients in international 
settings as well as the U.S. 
3. U.S. Legal Landscape Regarding Sex- 
Rejecting Procedures 
The United States has seen a high 
level of activity both at the State level 
and within the judicial system on this 
topic in recent years. 
a. U.S. State Laws 
Several States and territories have 
adopted laws reflecting their views of 
the evidence on SRPs for children with 
28 restricting and 15 protecting this 
treatment. As of August 2025, 27 States 
and one territory have laws limiting or 
prohibiting some or all SRPs for 
children.
66
These include Alabama, 
Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, 
Iowa, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, 
Montana, North Carolina, New 
Hampshire, North Dakota, Nebraska, 
Ohio, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South 
Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, 
Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and 
Wyoming. Of these, 2 States’ laws or 
policies (Montana and Arkansas) are 
pending resolution of ongoing legal 
challenges (as of August 2025). 
States with such laws or policies 
apply them to varying age ranges. 
Twenty-five States prohibit certain SRPs 
in individuals under the age of 18. Two 
States (Nebraska and Alabama) prohibit 
them for those under the age of 19. 
Puerto Rico prohibits such procedures 
for those under the age of 21. 
Which SRPs (that is puberty blockers, 
hormone therapy, and surgery) are 
banned for children varies by State. As 
of August 2025, 25 States have laws that 
prohibit access to puberty blockers, 
hormone therapies, and gender 
dysphoria related surgeries for children. 
Two States (New Hampshire and 
Arizona) have restrictions on surgery 
(but permit endocrine SRPs) for this 
population. No State bans only 
medications without also banning 
surgical procedures.
67
 
All the States and the territory with 
restrictions provide exceptions to the 
law/policies. The most common 
exceptions include: 
€Children born with medically verifiable disorder of sex development. 
This allows treatment for children who 
are born with medical conditions that 
affect their sexual development. These 
are rare conditions where a child’s 
reproductive or sexual anatomy does 
not develop in typical ways due to 
genetic, hormonal, or other factors that 
can be medically verified. 
€Children who have been diagnosed with a disorder of sexual development 
by a physician through genetic or 
biochemical testing. 
€Treatment for any infection, injury, disease, or disorder that has been 
caused or exacerbated by the 
performance of SPRs. 
€Children suffering from physical disorders, physical injuries, or physical 
illnesses that would otherwise place the 
children in danger of death or 
impairment of bodily function. 
We note that 12 States provide 
tapering off periods for patients who 
started puberty blockers or hormones 
before enactment of the restriction, with 
some specifying specific dates (for 
example, in South Carolina services 
cannot go beyond January 31, 2025) and 
others specifying a period of time from 
the date of enactment (ranging between 
6 months and 1 year). Ten States have 
grandfather clauses primarily allowing 
children who were already receiving 
treatment to continue receiving it 
indefinitely. 
Conversely, 14 States and the District 
of Columbia have shield laws protecting 
SRPs, and three other States have E.O.s 
protecting these procedures.

Shield laws and State E.O.s often 
describe SRPs broadly, including 
medications and procedures, and 
include these under broader definitions 
of protected healthcare activities. These 
laws often protect providers from 
adverse action by medical malpractice 
insurers and licensure boards and allow 
for their address to remain confidential. 
One State (Maine) has a shield law that 
allows children 16 and over to receive 
hormone therapy when the guardian has 
refused SRPs. Four States explicitly 
provide child abuse and child custody 
protections for parents who supported 
their children in receiving specified 
procedures. Four State shield laws and 
E.O.s have requirements for SRPs to be 
covered under health plans. Arizona 
requires coverage for State employee 
health plans. Illinois, Oregon, and 
Vermont require some level of SRPs 
coverage by all health insurance 
providers. Vermont includes an 
exception for services that do not 
comply with Federal law. 
b. United States Supreme Court 
Recently, the Supreme Court in 
United States v. Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. 1816 (2025) upheld Tennessee’s law 
(referred to as Senate Bill 1; SB 1) 
banning certain surgical and chemical 
interventions for children with gender 
dysphoria, in litigation challenging that 
law under the Equal Protection Clause 
of the U.S. Constitution. SB1 prohibits 
a healthcare provider from performing 
medical procedures, including surgery, 
and prescribing puberty blockers, for a 
child for the purpose of enabling the 
child to identify with a purported 
identity inconsistent with the child’s 
sex. At the same time, SB1 allows 
healthcare providers to perform medical 
procedures for children if the procedure 
is to treat a child’s congenital defect, 
precocious puberty, disease, or physical 
injury. On June 18, 2025, the Court 
found that SB1’s prohibition of certain 
medical procedures for children with 
gender dysphoria incorporates 
classifications based on age and medical 
use—not the child’s sex. As a result of 
these classifications based on age and 
medical use, the Court held that SB1 
was not subject to heightened scrutiny 
under the Equal Protection Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment and the law 
satisfied so called ‘‘rational basis’’ 
review. 
4. CMS Actions 
The proposed rule is animated by 
significant child safety concerns when 
SRPs are used for certain medical uses— 
that is to align a child’s physical 
appearance or body with an asserted 
identity that differs from the child’s 
biological sex. CMS published a formal 
guidance letter to State Medicaid 
Directors regarding SRPs on April 11, 
2025, reminding States of their 
responsibility to ensure that Medicaid 
payments are consistent with quality of 
care and that covered services are 
provided in a manner consistent with 
the best interest of recipients.
70
In 
addition, the Administrator of CMS sent 
a letter issued on May 28, 2025, to a 
number of hospitals addressing 
significant issues concerning quality 
standards and specific procedures 
affecting children. The letter requested 
that the recipient hospitals provide CMS 
with copies of certain hospital policies 
and procedures on the adequacy for 
informed consent protocols for children 
with gender dysphoria, including how 
hospitals determine that children are 
capable of making these potentially life 
changing decisions and when parental 
consent is required; describe any 
changes to clinical practice guidelines 
and protocols that the institution plans 
to enact in light of the recent 
comprehensive review and guidance 
released by the Department; provide 
CMS with medical evidence of any 
adverse events related to these 
procedures, particularly in children 
who later sought to detransition; and 
complete financial data for all pediatric 
SRPs performed at the institution and 
paid, in whole or in part, by the Federal 
Government.
71
 
In addition, on May 28, 2025, 
Secretary Kennedy wrote to hospitals, 
health care providers, health care risk 
managers, and State medical boards 
across the nation, asking them to read 
the HHS Review, and to make necessary 
updates to their ‘‘treatment protocols 
and training for care for children and 
adolescents with gender dysphoria to 
protect them from these harmful 
interventions.’’
72
 
These letters reaffirmed CMS’ and 
HHS’ commitment to following the 
highest standards of care and to 
adhering closely to the foundational 
principles of medicine, especially 
relating to doing no harm to America’s 
children and in alignment with CMS’s 
obligations to ensure baseline quality 
standards at institutions participating in 
the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
II. Provisions of the Proposed 
Regulations 
We have undertaken a review of the 
current hospital health and safety 
standards (known as the CoPs) as well 
as the latest information regarding SRPs 
in children to ensure hospitals are best 
protecting the health and safety of 
children. The evidence as presented in 
the Review (see section I.B.2. of this 
proposed rule) indicates that SRPs lack 
the necessary outcomes data on safety 
and long-term effectiveness. CMS takes 
very seriously the absence of rigorous 
scientific data demonstrating the safety 
and effectiveness of SRPs and the 
considerable evidence regarding the 
risks. Based on this, we believe that 
certain SRPs (namely pharmaceutical 
and surgical interventions) are not 
consistent with the health and safety of 
children, given the risk of significant 
(long term) harms, known 
complications, and weak and uncertain 
evidence of benefits. 
We therefore propose to add a new 
section to 42 CFR part 482, subpart C 
that would prohibit Medicare and 
Medicaid-participating hospitals from 
performing sex-rejecting procedures 
(SRPs) on any child (§ 482.46(a)). As set 
out in proposed § 482.46(a)(5), we 
propose to define SRPs as any 
pharmaceutical or surgical intervention 
that attempts to align an individual’s 
physical appearance or body with a 
stated identity that differs from the 
individual’s sex by either (1) 
intentionally disrupting or suppressing 
the development of biological functions, 
including primary or secondary sex- 
based traits or (2) intentionally altering 
an individual’s physical appearance or 
body, including removing, minimizing, 
or permanently impairing the function 
of primary or secondary sex-based traits 
such as the sexual and reproductive 
organs.

Review of Evidence and Best Practices.’’ HHS Office 
of Population Affairs,19 Nov. 2025, https://
opa.hhs.gov/gender-dysphoria-report, Pg. 24–26. We propose at § 482.46(a)(1) through 
(4) to include several additional 
definitions critical to interpreting the 
proposal. We propose that the term 
‘‘child’’ be defined as any individual 
younger than 18 years of age. We further 
propose that the term ‘‘female’’ be 
defined as an individual of the sex 
characterized by a reproductive system 
with the biological function of (at 
maturity, absent disruption or 
congenital anomaly) producing eggs 
(ova). We propose that the term ‘‘male’’ 
be defined as an individual of the sex 
characterized by a reproductive system 
with the biological function of (at 
maturity, absent disruption or 
congenital anomaly) producing sperm. 
Finally, we propose that the term ‘‘sex’’ 
is defined as an individual’s immutable 
biological classification as either male 
or female. 
At § 482.46(b), we are proposing 
exceptions to § 482.46(a) to protect the 
health and safety of children in certain 
rare and exceptional circumstances. 
Proposed exceptions include: 
€Procedures to treat an individual with a medically verifiable disorder of 
sexual development (§ 482.46(b)(1)). 
This allows treatment for children who 
are born with certain medical 
conditions that affect their sexual 
development. These are rare conditions 
where a child’s reproductive or sexual 
anatomy does not develop in typical 
ways due to genetic, hormonal, or other 
medical factors that can be medically 
verified and documented. Examples 
include a child with external biological 
sex characteristics that are irresolvably 
ambiguous, such as those born with 46 
XX chromosomes with virilization, 46 
XY chromosomes with under- 
virilization, or having both ovarian and 
testicular tissue. 
€Procedures for purposes other than attempting to align an individual’s 
physical appearance or body with an 
asserted identity that differs from the 
individual’s sex (§ 482.46(b)(2)). This 
permits procedures that are done for 
reasons entirely separate from changing 
a child’s physical appearance to match 
a gender identity that differs from their 
biological sex, including procedures for 
children with a physical disorder, 
injury, or physical illness. In other 
words, the procedure must have a 
purpose separate from intending to 
change the body to not correspond to 
one’s biological sex. 
€Treating Complications (§ 482.46(b)(3)). This exception allows treatment for any infections, injuries, 
diseases, or other medical disorders that 
were caused by or made worse by 
previous SRPs. This exception allows 
physicians or other licensed 
practitioners to treat complications that 
arise from these procedures. 
While we are proposing certain 
exceptions, any procedures or 
treatments under these exceptions must 
still be performed with the consent of 
the child’s parent or legal guardian, as 
currently required under the patient 
rights CoP at § 482.13(b)(2), the medical 
records CoP at § 482.24 (c)(4)(v), the 
surgical services CoP at § 482.51(b)(2), 
and in compliance with applicable State 
law(s). 
Practice of Medicine 
Under Section 1801 of the Act, CMS 
may not ‘‘exercise any supervision or 
control over the practice of medicine or 
the manner in which medical services 
are provided, (42 U.S.C. 1395). 
However, we believe that providing the 
SRPs for children is not healthcare and 
hence are not subsumed under the term 
of ‘‘the practice of medicine.’’ Therefore, 
the proposed rule would not regulate 
the practice of medicine. As the Review 
notes regarding SRPs, when ‘‘medical 
interventions pose unnecessary, 
disproportionate risks of harm, 
healthcare providers should refuse to 
offer them even when they are 
preferred, requested, or demanded by 
patients.’’
73
As the Review states, ‘‘in 
the domain of pediatrics, these norms 
limit the authority not only of patients 
(who in any case lack full decision- 
making capacity) but of parents as 
well.’’
74
The first obligation of the 
physician, under the Hippocratic Oath, 
originating in the fourth century BC, is 
to first do no harm, as the purpose of the 
practice of medicine is to heal. SRPs 
introduce a unique set of iatrogenic 
harms, especially, ‘‘surgeries to remove 
healthy and functioning organs.’’
75
The 
Review states: ‘‘to discharge their duties 
of nonmaleficence and beneficence, 
clinicians must ensure, insofar as 
reasonably possible, that any 
interventions they offer to patients have 
clinically favorable risk/benefit profiles 
relative to the set of available 
alternatives, which includes doing 
nothing.’’
76
As related previously in 
this proposed rule, the risk-benefit 
profile of these procedures for children 
is extremely poor. At the same time,’’ 
the Review notes, ‘‘there is increasing 
recognition of the risk and harms 
associated’’ with pediatric sex-rejecting 
procedures, including ‘‘possible 
outcomes, such as impaired cognitive 
function, greater susceptibility to 
hormone-sensitive cancers, cardiac 
disease, reduced bone density, sexual 
dysfunction, infection, and infertility 
[that] are objectively detrimental to 
health’’ The Review concludes 
that‘‘[s]uch medical harms, or plausible 
risks thereof, should not be imposed on 
children or adolescents in the absence 
of a reasonable expectation of 
proportionate medical benefit.’’
77
 
There are other considerations for 
why the regulations proposed in this 
rule do not regulate the practice of 
medicine. A person’s body (including 
its organs, organ systems, and processes 
natural to human development like 
puberty) are either healthy or unhealthy 
based on whether they are operating 
according to their biological functions. 
Organs or organ systems do not become 
unhealthy simply because the 
individual may experience 
psychological distress relating to his or 
her sexed body. For this reason, 
removing a patient’s breasts as a 
treatment for breast cancer is 
fundamentally different from 
performing the same procedure solely to 
alleviate mental distress arising from 
gender dysphoria. The former procedure 
aims to restore bodily health and to 
remove cancerous tissue. In contrast, 
removing healthy breasts or interrupting 
normally occurring puberty to ‘‘affirm’’ 
one’s ‘‘gender identity’’ involves the 
intentional destruction of healthy 
biological functions. This is not health 
care and hence imposing restrictions as 
this rule proposes does not limit the 
practice of medicine. The Review 
further notes there is lack of clarity 
about what SRPs’ fundamental aims are, 
unlike the broad consensus about the 
purpose of medical treatments for 
conditions like appendicitis, diabetes, 
or severe depression.
78
Rather as 
discussed above, these procedures lack 
strong evidentiary foundations, and our

understanding of long-term health 
impacts is limited and needs to be better 
understood. Nothing in this proposed 
rule prohibits or permits the basic 
legality of SRPs. Rather, this proposed 
rule would ensure patient safety and 
medical integrity. CMS would no longer 
directly or indirectly support harm to 
children by allowing facilities that 
engage in such harmful practices to 
receive Medicare and Medicaid funds. 
III. Collection of Information 
Requirements 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995, we are required to provide 60- 
day notice in the Federal Register and 
solicit public comment before a 
collection of information requirement is 
submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) for review and 
approval. To fairly evaluate whether an 
information collection should be 
approved by OMB, section 3506(c)(2)(A) 
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
requires that we solicit comment on the 
following issues: 
€The need for the information collection and its usefulness in carrying 
out the proper functions of our agency. 
€The accuracy of our estimate of the information collection burden. 
€The quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected. 
€Recommendations to minimize the information collection burden on the 
affected public, including automated 
collection techniques. 
We are soliciting public comment on 
each of these issues for the following 
section of this document that contains 
information collection requirements 
(ICRs). 
A. Hospital Notifications to Patients 
Proposed § 482.46 would require that 
hospitals not perform sex-rejecting 
procedures (SRPs) on children, barring 
certain exceptions. We expect that 
hospitals that are currently performing 
these procedures on children would 
need to inform the child and their 
parents or legal guardian who are 
seeking such procedures that they no 
longer perform such procedures. Based 
on our experience, we expect that the 
child’s physician or the licensed 
practitioner providing this care would 
spend an average of 30 minutes writing 
each notification. In addition, they 
would spend 30 minutes answering any 
questions from the child and their 
parents or legal guardian. This leads to 
a total burden of 1 hour per patient. 
To calculate the total provider burden 
across all patients, we first examined 
State laws and found that 25 States have 
active laws restricting SRPs.
79
Given 
these State laws that already prohibit 
these procedures, we do not expect that 
physicians or licensed practitioners in 
these States would be writing a 
significant number of notifications. 
While acknowledging that some 
children living in these States may be 
traveling to States that permit SRPs for 
children, we do not expect that this is 
a large number of children for two 
reasons. First, across States with these 
restrictions, nearly 45 percent of 
children were enrolled in Medicaid or 
CHIP as of March 2025 and these 
programs would not fund SRPs outside 
the State.
80
Second, a recent study 
showed that across States with 
restrictions on SRPs, the average driving 
time to the nearest clinic in a State 
without restrictions was 5.3 hours, with 
the average time in Florida reaching 9 
hours.
81
As such, we base our estimate 
on the number of children affected for 
children in States that currently do not 
have restrictions but seek comments on 
this assumption. 
The second step was to identify the 
number of individuals under the age of 
18 who live in States that allow SRPs. 
We combined information on State 
restrictions with Census Bureau 
population estimates
82
and found that 
there are approximately 8,674,717 
females and 9,165,563 males between 
the ages of 10 and 17 living in States 
that do not have active laws restricting 
SRPs. While acknowledging that 
children younger than 10 may be 
receiving SRPs, we believe this is a 
reasonable estimate of the population 
affected by the proposed requirement. 
The third step was to identify the 
number of individuals under 18 years of 
age who may be receiving SRPs. A 
recent study
83
found that among 
children between the ages of 8 and 17 
covered by private insurance, males 
received puberty blockers and hormones 
at a rate of 15.22 per 100,000 and 25.34 
per 100,000, respectively. Meanwhile, 
females received puberty blockers and 
hormones at a rate of 20.81 per 100,000 
and 49.9 per 100,000, respectively. 
Applying these rates to the number of 
males and females in States without 
active laws restricting SRPs,
84
we 
estimate that there are approximately 
6,651 individuals receiving hormones 
and 3,200 individuals receiving puberty 
blockers for a total of 9,851 individuals. 
As the authors note, these rates are more 
likely to be generalizable to patients 
with private insurance in large care 
plans and they expect lower rates for 
those utilizing Medicaid and in less 
comprehensive care plans. Another 
study
85
used national data to estimate 
the rate of sex rejecting surgical 
procedures and found that in 2019, 
there were approximately 85 sex- 
rejecting surgical procedures for 
children with a gender dysphoria 
diagnosis. The same as our estimates for 
the number of children receiving 
puberty blockers and hormones, this 
estimate is for insured patients and 
there may be lower rates for those 
utilizing Medicaid and in less 
comprehensive care plans. Given the 
overlap in treatment for some patients 
who may receive both surgical 
procedures and hormones, we estimate 
that a maximum of 9,851 individuals 
under the age of 18 are receiving SRPs. 
While hospitals often prescribed 
puberty blockers and hormone 
replacement therapy as part of sex- 
rejecting procedures, primary care 
providers and endocrinologists outside 
of hospitals, who would not be affected 
by these requirements, can also 
prescribe these treatments. A recent 
analysis found that approximately 52 
percent of primary care physicians were 
not affiliated with a hospital.
86
We do 
not know the share of children receiving 
puberty blockers or hormone 
replacement therapy outside the 
hospital setting and, therefore, would 
not need to receive notification that

SRPs were no longer offered. Assuming 
that 25 percent of children are receiving 
care from primary care physicians or 
endocrinologists and that 52 percent of 
these providers are outside the hospital 
system, then 8,570 of the 9,851 children 
receiving treatment as identified above 
would need to receive notices and have 
discussions with their treating 
physician or licensed practitioner. We 
seek comments on data sources on the 
number of children receiving puberty 
blockers or hormone replacement 
therapy outside the hospital setting who 
would not be affected by the proposed 
requirement. 
To estimate the total cost for this 
requirement, we assumed that a 
physician would write these notices. We 
calculated the physician’s hourly rate by 
doubling the national mean salary for 
physicians (occupation code 29–1210) 
using the BLS’ May 2024 National 
Occupational Employment and Wage 
Estimates for hospitals (NAICS code 
622000),
87
leading to an hourly cost of 
$226.18 ($113.09 × 2). We doubled the mean salary since the BLS data do not 
include overhead costs and fringe 
benefits. The HHS wide guidance on 
preparation of regulatory and paperwork 
burden estimates states that doubling 
salary costs is a good approximation for 
including these overhead and fringe 
benefit costs. Utilizing these data, in 
Table 1, we estimate that this 
requirement would cost $1,938,363. We 
seek comments on the estimated time 
burden for physicians to provide written 
notices to their patients that the hospital 
is no longer providing SRPs.

B. Updating Hospital Policies and 
Procedures 
In addition to sending out notices to 
patients that they are no longer 
providing SRPs, hospitals will need to 
update their policies and procedures to 
ensure that they align with the proposed 
requirements. 
To estimate the cost for hospitals to 
update their policies and procedures, 
we used data from the BLS’ May 2024 
National Occupational Employment and 
Wage Estimates for hospitals (NAICS 
code 622000),
88
and doubled the mean 
salary since the BLS data do not include 
overhead costs and fringe benefits. 
Based on our experience, we estimate 
that updating the hospital’s policies and 
procedures related to SRPs for children 
would take 3 hours of work from a 
physician (occupation code 29–1210) at 
$678.54 ($226.18 × 3 hours) and a member of the clerical staff (occupation 
code 43–6010) at $143.40 ($47.80 × 3 hours), and 3 hours of work from a 
lawyer (occupation code 23–1010) at 
$650.16 ($216.72 × 3 hours) to review the updated policies and procedures to 
ensure that they meet the legal 
guidelines. This leads to a total per 
facility cost of $1472.10. 
To estimate the number of hospitals 
that would need to update their policies 
and procedures, we first used the CMS’ 
Q2 2025 Provider of Services File— 
Hospitals & Non-Hospital Facilities 
dataset and identified a total of 4,832 
Medicare/Medicaid certified 
hospitals.
89
We expect that even in 
States that have active bans on SRPs, 
some hospitals would still need to 
update their policies and procedures 
since many of these States have 
exceptions that conflict with the 
requirements in this proposed rule. We 
recognize, however, that not all 
hospitals offer SRPs for children, and 
increasingly more hospitals nationwide 
are ending these services.
90
Given these 
uncertainties, we assume that 75 
percent, or 3,624 hospitals would need 
to update their policies and procedures. 
Using this estimate, we expect that 
hospitals would spend $5,334,890 
updating their policies and procedures. 
We seek comments on this estimate, 
specifically whether there are data 
sources to more accurately estimate the 
number of hospitals nationwide that 
currently offer SRPs for children.

IV. Response to Comments 
Because of the large number of public 
comments we normally receive on 
Federal Register documents, we are not 
able to acknowledge or respond to them 
individually. We will consider all 
comments we receive by the date and 
time specified in the 
DATESsection of 
this preamble, and, when we proceed 
with a subsequent document, we will 
respond to the comments in the 
preamble to that document. 
V. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
A. Statement of Need 
Throughout the United States, 
thousands of children are receiving sex- 
rejecting procedures (SRPs), specifically 
pharmacological and surgical 
interventions, for gender dysphoria. As 
outlined in section I. and II. of this 
proposed rule, however, recent HHS 
and international analyses question the 
efficacy and safety of SRPs in children. 
To protect children’s health and safety, 
we are proposing to prohibit hospitals 
subject to part 482 from performing 
SRPs on any child with certain 
exceptions to best protect children’s 
health and safety. 
B. Overall Impact 
We have examined the impacts of this 
proposed rule as required by Executive 
Order 12866, ‘‘Regulatory Planning and 
Review’’; Executive Order 13132, 
‘‘Federalism’’; Executive Order 13563, 
‘‘Improving Regulation and Regulatory 
Review’’; Executive Order 14192, 
‘‘Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation’’; the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (RFA) (Pub. L. 96 354); 
section 1102(b) of the statute; and 
section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104–4). 
Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 
direct agencies to assess all costs and 
benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select those regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, 
environmental, public health and safety, 
and other advantages; distributive 
impacts; and equity). Section 3(f) of 
Executive Order 12866 defines a 
‘‘significant regulatory action’’ as any 
regulatory action that is likely to result 
in a rule that may: (1) have an annual 
effect on the economy of $100 million 
or more or adversely affect in a material 
way the economy, a sector of the 
economy, productivity, competition, 
jobs, the environment, public health or 
safety, or State, local, or tribal 
governments or communities; (2) create 
a serious inconsistency or otherwise 
interfere with an action taken or 
planned by another agency; (3) 
materially alter the budgetary impact of 
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan 
programs or the rights and obligations of 
recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel 
legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, or the President’s priorities. 
The Office of Management and Budget’s 
(OMB) Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has 
determined this rulemaking is 
significant per section 3(f) of Executive 
Order 12866. 
As noted above in Table 1 and Table 
2, estimated costs of approximately $7.3 
million are due to the time that a 
physician or licensed practitioner 
would spend providing patients with 
notification that the hospital no longer 
provides these procedures and for 
hospitals to update their policies and 
procedures related to SRPs for children. 
Below, we estimate additional impacts 
from the proposed requirement. 
1. Costs and Transfers 
We estimated the value of treatments 
in hospitals that would change in 
response to the proposed requirements 
using data from a study analyzing the 
per person cost of these treatments 
based on commercial claims data from 
1993 to 2019.
91
This study estimated 
that for SRPs that included testosterone, 
estrogens and anti-androgens, and 
GnRH, there was an average combined 
cost to payors of $755 per person in 
2019 dollars. Adjusting for inflation,
92
 
this leads to an average cost of 
approximately $909 per patient in 2024 
dollars. For surgical procedures, there 
was an average per procedure cost of 
$28,367 in 2019 dollars. Adjusting for 
inflation, this leads to an average cost of 
approximately $34,165 in 2024 dollars. 
Utilizing our estimate in the collection 
of information section that 8,570 
children would be affected by our rule 
and that there are 85 surgical SRPs on 
children annually, we estimate an 
annual value of $7,790,130 (8,570 
patients × $909) for non-surgical SRPs and $2,904,025 (85 patients × $34,165) for surgical SRPs, for a total annual 
value of $10,694,155. 
For children who are currently 
receiving SRPs at hospitals, there is 
likely to be bifurcation in their response 
to the proposed requirement. Some of 
these children may no longer receive 
SRPs at non-hospital providers that are 
not covered by the proposed 
requirement due to factors, such as 
difficulty in identifying in-network 
providers that have available space and 
longer commute times to these 
providers.
93 94
The end of SRPs for these 
children would result in a reduced 
payments from payors, including 
insurance companies and private 
persons, to hospitals. Other children, 
however, are likely to switch to other 
provider types that are not affected by 
this proposed requirement. For these 
children, the proposed requirement 
would result in a change in transfers 
from Medicare-certified hospitals to 
other providers. 
In the absence of data showing the 
likely share of patients in each category, 
we assumed that 50 percent of affected 
children would fall into each of the 
categories described above. Using this 
percentage, we estimate that the 
proposed requirements would result in 
$5,347,077 in reduced costs for payors 
and a $5,347,077 change in transfers 
from hospitals to other provider types 
annually. We seek comments on our 
assumption regarding the share of 
patients in each group. 
For children who continue receiving 
SRPs, there are the costs associated with 
switching providers. Dahl and Forbes 
(2023) estimate that 46-percent of 
individuals are willing to pay over $600 
per person (in 2011 dollars, or 
approximately $821 when updated for 
inflation) to avoid switching medical 
providers.
95 96
The full willingness-to- 
pay (WTP) distribution is not reported, 
but for purposes of this regulatory

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with PROPOSALS159475 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Proposed Rules 97
The latter portion of the estimate persists in 
any year when SRPs are estimated to occur at a 
reduced level due to the proposed rule. By contrast, 
the former effect is assumed to decline over the first 
several years of the analytic time horizon, as 
provider-switching patients age out of childhood. 
98
The cost of setting up separate specialty 
facilities (a process encompassing managerial, legal, 
and physical tasks) would exceed the cost of 
achieving only physical separation—estimated 
previously by the Department to be at least $20,000 
to $40,000 per entity undertaking such actions.

impact analysis, it is assumed that $821 
is a reasonable estimate of an average 
that includes the 46-percent of WTP 
amounts above it and the 54-percent 
below. Applying this $821 amount to 
the above-estimated 8,570 affected 
patients (including 4,285 patients who 
would switch providers and 4,285 
patients for whom the switching-cost 
estimate is a lower bound on the WTP 
to avoid the experience of being unable 
to switch
97
yields a cost estimate of 
$7,035,970 that declines over several 
years to an annual $3,517,985. Because 
the Dahl and Forbes estimate is derived 
from a choice between retaining or 
switching primary-care physicians— 
where finding substitute providers may 
be relatively easy as compared with 
finding, and maintaining patient- 
provider relationship with facilities 
offering the specialized treatment 
associated with adolescent gender 
dysphoria—this estimate may have a 
tendency toward understatement of the 
proposed rule’s cost to patients for 
switching providers. 
In Table 3, we estimate the costs and 
transfers associated with the proposed 
requirement over 10 years. Overall, we 
expect that this proposed rule would 
result in approximately $53.5 million in 
savings for payors due to some patients 
ending SRPs, with a cost of $44 million 
to patients who continue treatment at 
new providers for finding a new 
provider and for patients who would 
have paid to avoid the experience of 
being unable to switch providers. We 
also expect a change in transfers of 
$53.5 million from hospitals to other 
provider types as patients seek 
alternative sources of care. The effect 
attributable to this proposed rule might 
be lower in magnitude than the 
aggregate presented here if other 
actions, such as the HHS/CMS proposal 
titled ‘‘Prohibition on Federal Medicaid 
and Children’s Health Insurance 
Program Funding for Sex-Rejecting 
Procedures Furnished to Children’’ are 
finalized before finalization of this 
proposal.

acknowledge that this quantitative 
approach may fail to capture a societal 
cost pattern that may be somewhat 
concentrated in upfront transition activity—for example, the potential 
establishment of free-standing clinics to 
provide SRPs that would newly be 
prohibited at hospitals participating in 
Medicare.
98
There may also be costs for 
clinicians who provide SRPs for 
children at hospitals who would incur 
costs to move to other provider types 
where these procedures are allowed. We 
also acknowledge that some patients 
may choose new forms of treatment 
such as psychotherapy. Given these 
various uncertainties, we request 
comment on how to refine the 
estimation of regulatory costs. 
2. Benefits 
As we have noted throughout the 
proposed rule in Sections I and II, the 
proposed requirement is designed to 
ensure the health and safety of children 
by limiting SRPs given recent research 
that questions its efficacy and safety. 
Although we do not have quantitative 
financial data on the impact of the 
proposed rule’s provision, we estimate 
the number of children who this 
proposed rule would positively affect 
using the same strategy used when 
estimating the rule’s collection of 
information costs. Specifically, we 
expect that due to factors such as 
difficulty in identifying in-network 
providers that have available space and 
longer commute times to these 
providers
99 100
, half of the 8,570 (or 
4,285) children who are receiving SRPs 
in hospitals would stop receiving these 
procedures leading to the avoidance of 
unnecessary health complications. As 
noted in the collection of information 
section, we assumed this percentage in 
the absence of quantitative data showing 
the number of children who will no 
longer seek SRPs. We seek comments on 
additional benefits that could emerge 
from these proposed requirements and 
sources of data to provide a quantitative 
estimate of the proposed rule’s benefits. 
We also seek comments on sources of 
data to more accurately estimate the

number of children who will stop 
receiving SRPs. 
C. Alternatives Considered 
As we detailed earlier in this 
proposed rule, the growth in SRPs in 
children is a growing concern given 
recent research that questions its 
efficacy and safety. We believe that the 
changes we are proposing are necessary 
to ensure the health and safety of 
children throughout the United States 
and align with the best available 
scientific evidence. We acknowledge, 
however, that there are different 
standards that we could have used in 
developing these proposed 
requirements. 
In developing this proposed rule, we 
considered aligning our requirements 
with those States that already have 
restrictions on SRPs but with a variety 
of exceptions they provide as outlined 
in Section 1.B of this proposed rule. For 
example, we could have allowed those 
currently receiving these procedures to 
continue receiving them. Ultimately, 
however, we have decided to adopt the 
proposed provisions with fewer 
exceptions than are allowed in these 
States to maximize health and safety for 
all children. We seek comments, 
however, on whether we should adopt 
one or more of the additional State 
exceptions related to SRPs. 
D. Regulatory Review Cost Estimation 
Due to the uncertainty involved with 
accurately quantifying the number of 
entities that will review the proposed 
rule when finalized, we assume that all 
hospitals will review this rule. We 
acknowledge that this assumption may 
understate or overstate the costs of 
reviewing this proposed rule. It is also 
possible that other individuals and 
providers will review this proposed 
rule. For these reasons we thought that 
doubling the number of Medicare or 
Medicaid certified hospitals (n = 4,832) 
would be a fair estimate of the number 
of reviewers of this proposed rule. We 
welcome any comments on the 
approach in estimating the number of 
entities which will review this proposed 
rule. We also recognize that different 
types of entities are in many cases 
affected by mutually exclusive sections 
of this proposed rule, and therefore, for 
the purposes of our estimate, we assume 
that each reviewer reads approximately 
75 percent of the rule. We seek 
comments on this assumption. 
Using the wage information from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for 
medical and health service managers 
(Code 11–9111), we estimate that the 
cost of reviewing this proposed rule is 
$132.44 per hour, including overhead 
and fringe benefits (https://www.bls.gov/ 
oes/current/oes_nat.htm). Assuming an average reading speed of 250 words per 
minute, we estimate that it would take 
approximately ([9,500 words/250 words 
per minute] × 75 percent) 28.5 minutes for the staff to review 75 percent of this 
proposed rule. For each entity that 
reviews the rule, the estimated cost is 
$62.91 (0.475 hours × $132.44). Therefore, we estimate that the total cost 
of reviewing this regulation is $607,962 
($[62.91] × [9,664]). E. Accounting Statement 
As required by OMB Circular A–4 
(available online at https://
www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/ 
uploads/2025/08/CircularA-4.pdf), we 
have prepared an accounting statement 
in Table 4 showing classification of the 
costs and benefits associated with the 
provisions of this proposed rule. This 
includes the total costs for hospitals 
providing notices to children and their 
parents that they are no longer 
providing SRPs as identified in Table 1, 
the cost for hospitals to update their 
policies and procedures in Table 2, the 
reduction in costs due to the ending of 
SRPs for some patients as well as an 
increase in cost for patients who seek 
new providers in Table 3, as well as the 
regulatory review costs. There are also 
transfer costs for patients seeking care at 
other providers as outlined in Table 3. 
There are $0 benefit estimates in the 
statement. This statement provides our 
best estimate for the Medicare and 
Medicaid provisions of this proposed 
rule.

The RFA requires agencies to analyze 
options for regulatory relief of small 
entities, if a rule has a significant impact 
on a substantial number of small 
entities. For purposes of the RFA, we 
estimate that most hospitals (NAICS 
6221) are considered small businesses 
either by the Small Business 
Administration’s size standards with 
total revenues of $47.0 million or less in 
any single year or by the hospital’s not 
for profit status. According to the 2022 
Economic Census,
101
general medical 
and surgical hospitals (NAICS 6221) 
have revenues of $1.27 trillion. 
Individuals and States are not 
included in the definition of a small 
entity. As its measure of significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities, HHS uses a 
change in revenue of more than 3 to 5 
percent. With estimated annual costs 
and reduction in transfers resulting in 
the loss of approximately $11.4 million 
in annual revenues for hospitals, which 
is approximately 0.0008 percent of 
revenues, this proposed rule would not 
have a significant economic impact as 
measured on a substantial number of 
small businesses or other small entities 
as measured by a change in revenue of 
3 to 5 percent. Therefore, the Secretary 
has certified that this proposed rule will 
not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small 
entities. 
In addition, section 1102(b) of the 
statute requires us to prepare a 
regulatory impact analysis if a rule may 
have a significant impact on the 
operations of a substantial number of 
small rural hospitals. This analysis must 
conform to the provisions of section 603 
of the RFA. For purposes of section 
1102(b) of the statute, we define a small 
rural hospital as a hospital that is 
located outside of a metropolitan 
statistical area and has fewer than 100 
beds. With total requirement costs and 
the loss of transfers reducing hospital 
revenues by approximately $11.4 
million annually for all 4,832 hospitals, 
or $2,194 per hospital, we expect that

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with PROPOSALS159477 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Proposed Rules this proposed rule would have a 
negligible impact on small rural 
hospitals. Therefore, the Secretary has 
certified that this proposed rule will not 
have a significant impact on the 
operations of a substantial number of 
small rural hospitals. 
G. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
(UMRA) 
Section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) 
also requires that agencies assess 
anticipated costs and benefits before 
issuing any rule whose mandates 
require spending in any 1 year of $100 
million in 1995 dollars, updated 
annually for inflation. In 2025, that 
threshold is approximately $187 
million. This proposed rule does not 
mandate any spending requirements for 
State, local, or tribal governments, or for 
the private sector. 
H. Federalism 
Executive Order 13132 establishes 
certain requirements that an agency 
must meet when it issues a proposed 
rule (and subsequent final rule) that 
imposes substantial direct requirement 
costs on State and local governments, 
pre-empts State law, or otherwise has 
federalism implications. This proposed 
rule would pre-empt State laws that 
prohibit SRPs for children that include 
exceptions for reasons beyond those 
exceptions provided in this proposed 
rule, including for children who are 
already undergoing these procedures. It 
would also pre-empt State laws 
requiring hospitals to provide SRPs. 
Consistent with the Executive Order, 
we find that State and local laws that 
provide exceptions from the prohibition 
beyond those listed in this proposed 
rule, as well as State and local laws that 
require hospitals to provide SRPs for 
children, directly conflict with this 
exercise of CMS’ statutory health and 
safety authority to prohibit providers 
subject to this proposed rule from 
providing these procedures. 
Similarly, to the extent that State-run 
hospitals that receive Medicare and 
Medicaid funding are required by State 
or local law to provide SRPs for 
children except in those cases covered 
by our exceptions, there is direct 
conflict between the provisions of this 
proposed rule (prohibiting such 
procedures) and the State or local law 
(allowing them). 
As is relevant here, this proposed rule 
preempts the applicability of any State 
or local law providing for SRPs to the 
extent such law provides broader 
grounds for these procedures than 
provided for by Federal law and are 
inconsistent with this proposed rule. In 
these cases, consistent with the 
Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, 
the agency intends that this proposed 
rule preempts State and local laws to 
the extent the State and local laws 
conflict with this proposed rule. The 
agency has considered other alternatives 
(for example, relying entirely on State 
laws prohibiting SRPs) and has 
concluded that the requirements 
established by this proposed rule are the 
minimum regulatory action necessary to 
achieve the objectives of the statute. 
Given the growth in SRPs among 
children in recent years, we believe that 
the prohibition of these procedures for 
children is necessary to promote and 
protect patient health and safety. The 
agency has examined research on SRPs 
for children and concludes that it can 
cause permanent harm with uncertain 
benefits. We are inviting State and local 
comments on the substance as well as 
legal issues presented by this proposed 
rule, and its impact on them. 
I. E.O. 14192, ‘‘Unleashing Prosperity 
Through Deregulation’’ 
Executive Order 14192, entitled 
‘‘Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation’’ was issued on January 31, 
2025, and requires that ‘‘any new 
incremental costs associated with new 
regulations shall, to the extent permitted 
by law, be offset by the elimination of 
existing costs associated with at least 10 
prior regulations.’’ We followed the 
implementation guidance from OMB– 
M–25–20 (https://www.whitehouse.gov/

Assistance 
AGENCY: Office for Civil Rights (OCR), Office of the Secretary, Department of 
Health and Human Services. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or Department) 
issues this Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (NPRM) to revise 45 CFR 
84.4(g) in the regulation implementing 
section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 
1973 (section 504) as it applies to 
recipients of HHS funding (entitled 
‘‘Nondiscrimination on the Basis of 
Disability in Programs or Activities 
Receiving Federal Financial 
Assistance,’’ 89 FR 40066 (‘‘2024 Final 
Rule’’)), published on May 9, 2024. This 
rule clarifies that the Department 
interprets the statutory exclusion of 
‘‘gender identity disorders not resulting 
from physical impairments’’ from the 
definitions of ‘‘individual with a 
disability’’ and ‘‘disability’’ set forth at 
29 U.S.C. 705(9) & (20)(F)(i), 42 U.S.C. 
12211(b), to encompass ‘‘gender 
dysphoria not resulting from a physical 
impairment’’ for purposes of part 84. 
This clarification is necessary to resolve 
ambiguity introduced in the preamble to 
the 2024 Final Rule and to ensure 
compliance with the best reading of the 
plain language of the governing statute.

Background 
Statutory Framework 
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act 
of 1973, codified at 29 U.S.C. 794, 
prohibits discrimination on the basis of 
disability in federally assisted and 
federally conducted programs and 
activities. Specifically, 29 U.S.C. 794(a) 
provides: ‘‘No otherwise qualified 
individual with a disability in the 
United States, as defined in section 
705(20) of this title, shall, solely by 
reason of his or her disability, be 
excluded from the participation in, be 
denied the benefits of, or be subjected 
to discrimination under any program or 
activity receiving Federal financial 
assistance or under any program or 
activity conducted by any Executive 
agency[.]’’ The HHS Office for Civil 
Rights (OCR) enforces section 504 as 
well as other statutes that prohibit 
discrimination on the basis of disability. 
Although the Rehabilitation Act 
predates the Americans with Disabilities 
Act of 1990 (ADA), Congress 
subsequently amended the 
Rehabilitation Act, through the 
Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 
(Pub. L. 102–569, sec. 102, 106 Stat 
4344), to align key definitions in the 
Rehabilitation Act with key definitions 
in the ADA. Under these amendments, 
the term ‘‘individual with a disability’’ 
‘‘does not include an individual on the 
basis of . . . transvestism, 
transsexualism, pedophilia, 
exhibitionism, voyeurism, gender

The DSM–IV also included a category for 
‘‘Gender Identity Disorder Not Otherwise 
Specified’’ that was ‘‘included for coding disorders 
in gender identity that are not classifiable as a 
specific Gender Identity Disorder,’’ and which 
could be used, for example, ‘‘for individuals who 
have a gender identity problem with a concurrent 
congenital intersex condition.’’ DSM–IV at 537, 538.

identity disorders not resulting from 
physical impairments, or other sexual 
behavior disorders.’’ 29 U.S.C. 
705(20)(F)(i). 
Congress amended the Rehabilitation 
Act again, in the ADA Amendments Act 
of 2008 (Pub. L. 110–325, sec. 7, 122 
Stat 3553), to further align the 
Rehabilitation Act definitions with the 
ADA. Specifically, 29 U.S.C. 705(9)(B) 
states: ‘‘The term ‘disability’ means . . . 
for purposes of [section 504], the 
meaning given it in section 12102 of 
[the ADA].’’ In addition, the definition 
of ‘‘individual with a disability’’ at 29 
U.S.C. 705(20)(B) was revised for 
purposes of section 504 to mean ‘‘any 
person who has a disability as defined 
in section 12102 of [the ADA].’’ Under 
the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12102(1), 
‘‘disability’’ means: ‘‘(A) a physical or 
mental impairment that substantially 
limits one or more major life activities 
of such individual; (B) a record of such 
an impairment; or (C) being regarded as 
having such an impairment.’’ The ADA, 
at 42 U.S.C. 12211(b), explicitly 
excludes certain conditions from the 
definition of ‘‘disability.’’ Specifically, 
42 U.S.C. 12211(b)(1) states that, ‘‘under 
this Chapter,’’ on Equal Opportunity for 
Individuals with Disabilities,’’[t]he term 
‘disability’ shall not include (1) 
transvestism, transsexualism, 
pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, 
gender identity disorders not resulting 
from physical impairments, or other 
sexual behavior disorders[.]’’ Thus, any 
regulatory interpretation of section 504 
must adhere to these identical statutory 
exclusions from the definitions of 
‘‘individual with a disability’’ and 
‘‘disability.’’ 
Relevant Medical Diagnostic History of 
‘‘Gender Dysphoria’’ 
At the time Congress passed the ADA, 
the American Psychiatric Association’s 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
(DSM), third edition (1987) (‘‘DSM–III– 
R’’) described a set of disorders as 
‘‘gender identity disorders.’’ DSM–III–R 
at 71–78. This set of disorders included 
‘‘Gender Identity Disorder of 
Childhood,’’ ‘‘Transsexualism,’’ 
‘‘Gender Identity Disorder of 
Adolescence or Adulthood, 
Nontranssexual Type (GIDAANT),’’ and 
‘‘Gender Identity Disorder Not 
Otherwise Specified.’’ Id. As described in DSM–III–R, the ‘‘essential feature of 
the disorders included in this subclass 
[Gender Identity Disorders] is an 
incongruence between assigned sex (i.e., 
the sex that is recorded on the birth 
certificate) and gender identity.’’ Id. at 71. 
The descriptions for each of the 
disorders within the DSM–III–R’s set of 
‘‘Gender Identity Disorders’’ tracked this 
essential feature. ‘‘Gender Identity 
Disorder of Childhood’’ was marked by 
‘‘persistent and intense distress in a 
child about his or her assigned sex and 
the desire to be, or insistence that he or 
she is, of the other sex.’’ Id. at 71. An ‘‘essential feature[ ]’’ of 
‘‘transsexualism’’ included ‘‘a persistent 
discomfort and sense of 
inappropriateness about one’s assigned 
sex in a person who has reached 
puberty.’’ Id. at 74. GIDAANT similarly included ‘‘a persistent or recurrent 
discomfort and sense of 
inappropriateness about one’s assigned 
sex[.]’’ Id. at 76. Finally, ‘‘Gender Identity Disorder Not Otherwise 
Specified’’ served as a catch-all for 
‘‘[d]isorders in gender identity that are 
not classifiable as a specific Gender 
Identity Disorder.’’ Id. at 77. The conditions were associated with 
symptoms such as anxiety and 
depression. Id. at 72, 74, 76. The DSM–III–R was in effect at the 
time Congress passed the exclusionary 
language at issue. Later, the diagnostic 
framework in the DSM–III–R was 
revised in the DSM fourth edition (1994) 
(‘‘DSM–IV’’) to describe a singular 
condition, ‘‘Gender Identity Disorder.’’ 
DSM–IV at 532–38.
1
The DSM–IV’s 
description of ‘‘Gender Identity 
Disorder’’ included a diagnostic 
criterion that the condition ‘‘causes 
clinically significant distress or 
impairment in social, occupational, or 
other important areas of functioning.’’ 
DSM–IV at 538. 
In 2013, the American Psychiatric 
Association revised its terminology in 
the DSM fifth edition (‘‘DSM–5’’), 
replacing the section on ‘‘Gender 
Identity Disorder’’ with a section on 
‘‘Gender Dysphoria.’’ DSM–5 at 451–59. 
In DSM–5, ‘‘[g]ender dysphoria refers to 
the distress that may accompany the 
incongruence between one’s 
experienced or expressed gender and 
one’s assigned gender.’’ Id. at 451. The DSM–5 explained that the terminology 
change was because ‘‘[t]he current term 
is more descriptive than the previous 
DSM–IV term gender identity disorder 
and focuses on dysphoria as the clinical 
problem, not identity per se.’’ Id. 
The diagnostic criteria for ‘‘gender 
dysphoria’’ remained functionally 
similar to the criteria for gender identity 
disorder(s) in previous versions of the 
DSM. To qualify for a diagnosis of 
gender dysphoria under DSM–5, a 
person must exhibit a ‘‘marked 
incongruence between one’s 
experienced/expressed gender and 
assigned gender’’ ‘‘of at least six 
months’ duration,’’ as manifested 
through specific urges or convictions. 
Id. at 452. ‘‘The condition is associated with clinically significant distress or 
impairment in social, occupational, or 
other important areas of functioning.’’ 
Id. at 452–53. Importantly, the American Psychiatric Association 
explicitly acknowledged that this was 
not the creation of a new diagnosis, but 
rather a reframing of the same 
condition: ‘‘This diagnosis is a revision 
of DSM–IV’s criteria for gender identity 
disorder and is intended to better 
characterize the experiences of affected children, adolescents, and adults.’’

Fourth Circuit Interpretation and 
Litigation 
The Rehabilitation Act and the ADA 
expressly exclude ‘‘gender identity 
disorders not resulting from physical 
impairments’’ from the definition of 
‘‘disability.’’ As noted above, this 
exclusion was enacted in the ADA in 
1990 and has never been amended by 
Congress. 
While this seems straightforward, in 
recent years, Federal district courts have 
split on whether ‘‘Gender Dysphoria’’ 
falls within the ADA’s exclusion for 
gender identity disorders not resulting 
from physical impairments.
3
The Fourth 
Circuit’s decision in Williams v. Kincaid, 45 F.4th 759 (4th Cir. 2022), cert. denied, 600 U.S. (2023), represents 
the only appellate review of this issue 
on the merits under the ADA and the 
Rehabilitation Act. 
In Williams the court concluded, in a 2–1 decision, that gender dysphoria is 
not excluded from the ADA’s definition 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:20 Dec 18, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\19DEP1.SGM 19DEP1
lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with PROPOSALS159480 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Proposed Rules 4
The factual basis of Kincaid’s 2022 holding has 
since been called into doubt. The majority opinion 
relied in part on the applicability of the seventh 
edition of the World Professional Association for 
Transgender Health Standards of Care (‘‘WPATH 
Standards’’) to interpret the gender identify 
disorder exclusion. Kincaid, 45 F.4th at 764, 769; id. at 782 (Quattlebaum, J., dissenting) (recognizing the majority’s reliance on WPATH Standards). 
Since that opinion, the basis for the WPATH 
standards have been undermined. See Eknes Tucker 
v. Governor, 114 F.4th 1241, 1261 (11th Cir. 2024) (Lagoa, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en 
banc) (‘‘recent revelations indicate that WPATH’s 
lodestar is ideology, not science’’); see also 
Statement of Interest of the United States, Fuller v. Georgia Dep’t of Corr., N.D. Ga., 25–cv–246, Apr. 
25, 2025.

Litigation also has been filed in the Western 
District of Louisiana similarly challenging the 
section 504 preamble reference to gender dysphoria. 
Rapides Parish Sch. Bd. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., et al, 1:25–cv–70 (W.D. La.).

of ‘‘disability.’’ Williams, 45 F.4th at 769, 773–74. The majority reasoned that 
gender dysphoria, as clinically 
classified, is distinct from ‘‘gender 
identity disorders not resulting from 
physical impairments’’ excluded by the 
ADA in 42 U.S.C. 12211(b)(1). Id. 
Specifically, the court emphasized that 
gender dysphoria involves clinically 
significant distress and functional 
impairments, and that, thus, the 
diagnostic criteria under the DSM–5 
differ from those of the gender identity 
disorders referenced in the DSM–III–R 
when the ADA was enacted in 1990. 
Williams, 45 F.4th at 767–68. The majority interpreted the ADA in light of 
what it viewed as evolving medical 
concepts. 
The Supreme Court subsequently 
denied certiorari in Kincaid v. Williams, 600 U.S., ll143, S. Ct. 2414 (2023), 
leaving the Fourth Circuit’s judgment 
intact. As a result, Williams remains binding precedent within Maryland, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, 
Virginia, and West Virginia, but it does 
not constitute controlling authority 
elsewhere.

See Maryland v. Balt. Radio Show, Inc., 338 U.S. 912, 919 (1950) 
(Frankfurter, J., respecting denial of 
certiorari) (noting that denial of 
certiorari ‘‘does not remotely imply 
approval . . . of what was said by [the 
lower court]’’). 
Relevant Regulatory History and Related 
Lawsuits 
On May 9, 2024, the Department 
issued the 2024 Final Rule modifying its 
regulations implementing section 504. 
As relevant here, the preamble to the 
2024 Final Rule discussed whether 
‘‘gender dysphoria may constitute a 
disability under section 504.’’ 89 FR at 
40069. The 2024 Final Rule concluded, 
in its preamble, that ‘‘gender dysphoria 
does not fall with the statutory 
exclusions for gender identity 
disorders.’’ Id. The codified regulatory text merely cross-referenced the 
statutory exclusion in 29 U.S.C. 
705(20)(F). See 45 CFR 84.4(g). The 2024 Final Rule, including its 
preamble language, spawned litigation. 
In Texas v. Becerra, No. 5:24–cv–00225 (N.D. Tex.), seventeen States filed suit 
challenging the 2024 Final Rule, 
arguing, among other things, that the 
preamble’s reference to gender 
dysphoria unlawfully expands the 
definition of ‘‘disability’’ beyond the 
scope authorized by 29 U.S.C. 
705(20)(F) and 42 U.S.C. 12211(b).
5
 
In response to the litigation, the 
Department published a notice in the 
Federal Register (90 FR 15412 (Apr. 11, 
2025)). The notice highlights the 
Department’s concern that ‘‘there has 
been significant confusion about the 
preamble language referencing gender 
dysphoria in the’’ 2024 Final Rule. Id. 
at 15412. The notice stated: ‘‘It is well- 
established that where, as here, the 
language included in the regulatory text 
itself is clear, statements made in the 
preamble to a final rule published in the 
Federal Register, lack the force and 
effect of law and are not enforceable.’’ 
This NPRM reaffirms the statutory 
exclusion of 29 U.S.C. 705(20)(F) in 
unambiguous terms for section 504 
coverage and makes clear that the 
Department interprets the exclusionary 
language ‘‘gender identity disorders not 
resulting from physical impairments’’ to 
encompass gender dysphoria that does 
not result from physical impairment. 
Legal Authority 
The Department has legal authority 
under the Rehabilitation Act to 
promulgate regulations ‘‘as may be 
necessary to carry out [section 504].’’ 29 
U.S.C. 794(a). Indeed, since 1977, the 
year the Department (then, the 
Department of Health Education and 
Welfare) issued the implementing 
regulation for section 504 Part 84, the 
Department has exercised this authority 
to interpret the requirements of 29 
U.S.C. 794(a) and provide certainty to 
recipients of Department financial 
assistance that they are in compliance 
with section 504. For example, in 
Alexander v. Choate, the Supreme Court relied on the general nondiscrimination 
requirements in HHS’ section 504 
implementing regulations in Part 84 
when determining whether limitations 
on Medicaid benefits amounted to 
discrimination under section 504.
6
 
As stated in Loper Bright v. 
Raimondo, ‘‘when a particular statute delegates authority to an agency 
consistent with constitutional limits, 
courts must respect the delegation, 
while ensuring the agency acts within 
it.’’
7
While courts must respect that 
Congress delegated authority to HHS to 
implement regulations for section 504 
and interpret the nondiscrimination 
requirements of the statute, the 
preamble to the 2024 Final Rule went 
beyond the statutory limits when it 
interpreted the definition of disability in 
a manner that included a condition 
excluded by Congress. 
Administrative agencies must act 
within the limits of authority delegated 
to them by Congress. As the Supreme 
Court has made clear, ‘‘[a]n agency 
literally has no power to act . . . unless 
and until Congress confers power upon 
it.’’ Louisiana Public Service Commission v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986). Agencies may not expand their 
authority or reframe statutory provisions 
based on policy preferences. See 
Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 291 (2001) (stating that agencies cannot 
through rulemaking ‘‘conjure up a 
[right] that has not been authorized by 
Congress. Agencies may play the 
sorcerer’s apprentice but not the 
sorcerer himself’’). 
The definition of ‘‘individual with a 
disability’’ in section 504 and the 
definition of ‘‘disability’’ that applies to 
both section 504 and the ADA do not 
cover ‘‘transvestism, transsexualism, 
pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, 
gender identity disorders not resulting 
from physical impairments, or other 
sexual behavior disorders.’’ 29 U.S.C. 
705(9) & (20)(F)(i), 42 U.S.C. 
12211(b)(1). As neither section 504 nor 
the ADA define ‘‘gender identity 
disorders,’’ the term must be given the 
‘‘ordinary meaning’’ it had at the time 
of its adoption. See Niz-Chavez v. 
Garland, 593 U.S. 155, 160 (2021) (‘‘When called on to resolve a dispute 
over a statute’s meaning, this Court 
normally seeks to afford the law’s terms 
their ordinary meaning at the time 
Congress adopted them.’’). Given the 
history of the terms ‘‘gender identity 
disorders’’ and ‘‘gender dysphoria’’ 
referenced above, under the ordinary 
meaning of the term as used in the 
DSM–III–R, gender identity disorder, as 
a category, includes gender dysphoria. 
In the 1990s, gender identity 
disorders were understood to be a 
family of conditions which shared the 
same ‘‘essential feature’’: an individual 
experiencing ‘‘incongruence between 
assigned sex (i.e., the sex that is recorded on the birth certificate) and 
gender.’’ DSM–III–R at 71. The DSM–

See 5 U.S.C. 706. III–R noted that an individual with even 
mild incongruence could feel 
‘‘discomfort and a sense of 
inappropriateness about the[ir] assigned 
sex.’’ Id. at 77. The distress resulting from the discomfort could also manifest 
as ‘‘[a]nxiety and depression.’’ Id. at 76. Not all individuals with gender 
incongruence can fit squarely within a 
subcategory due to a variation of 
symptoms. However, even if an 
individual does not fit within a specific 
subcategory, the individual would have 
a ‘‘Gender Identity Disorder Not 
Otherwise Specified’’ Id. at 77–78. A later update of the DSM published 
in 1994 clarified that distress was part 
and parcel of a gender identity disorder. 
To make a gender identity disorder 
diagnosis, ‘‘there must be evidence of 
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or 
other important areas of functioning.’’ 
DSM–IV at 533 (emphasis added). 
The DSM–5 switched from using the 
term ‘‘gender identity disorders’’ to 
‘‘gender dysphoria.’’ But the difference 
is merely linguistic. Gender dysphoria 
specifically ‘‘refers to the distress that 
may accompany the incongruence 
between one’s experienced or expressed 
gender and one’s assigned gender.’’ 
DSM–5 at 451. To be diagnosed with 
gender dysphoria, an individual must 
show the hallmark of a gender identity 
disorder—gender incongruence. See 
DSM–5 at 452–53. Then, because of that 
incongruence, they must also have 
‘‘clinically significant distress or 
impairment.’’ See id. In other words, gender dysphoria is gender identity 
disorder where the person has 
specifically had ‘‘clinically significant 
distress.’’ 
While the American Psychiatric 
Association and the medical profession 
may have changed how they 
conceptualize gender identity disorders 
by focusing on the distress rather than 
on the incongruence, they do not have 
the authority to redefine the meaning of 
statutes. See id. at 451 (explaining that change in conceptualizing gender 
identity disorders); As Judge 
Quattlebaum wrote in his opinion in 
Williams, ‘‘linguistic drift cannot alter the meaning of the words in the ADA 
when it was enacted.’’ Williams, 45 F.4th at 780; see also Loper Bright 
Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 400 (2024) (‘‘[E]very statute’s meaning is 
fixed at the time of enactment.’’ 
(quotation omitted)). 
The exclusions from the definition of 
‘‘disability’’ applicable to the ADA and 
section 504 and from the definition of 
‘‘individual with a disability’’ 
applicable in section 504, cannot be 
circumvented through renaming or 
redefining the conditions that are 
excluded in the law. Gender identity 
disorders were understood to 
encompass conditions where the person 
was suffering from gender incongruence 
and the accompanying distress. Gender 
dysphoria falls squarely within this 
framework. 
Here, the Rehabilitation Act and the 
ADA expressly exclude ‘‘gender identity 
disorders not resulting from physical 
impairments’’ from the definitions of 
‘‘disability’’ and ‘‘individual with a 
disability.’’ 29 U.S.C. 705(9) & (20)(F)(i); 
42 U.S.C. 12211(b)(1). OCR does not 
have the authority to broaden or narrow 
these statutory exclusions through 
agency rulemaking. Deviation from the 
statute Congress enacted would be 
legally vulnerable under the 
Administrative Procedure Act, which 
requires federal courts to ‘‘hold 
unlawful and set aside’’ agency actions 
taken ‘‘in excess of statutory 
jurisdiction, authority, or limitations.’’ 5 
U.S.C. 706(2)(C). 
While Williams framed its analysis in terms of evolving medical 
classifications, such reliance on post- 
enactment developments in the DSM–5 
raises serious concerns under 
established canons of statutory 
construction. Instead, one must look to 
the DSM–III–R, in place in 1990, which 
provides that, even in mild cases, 
gender identity disorders involve 
‘‘discomfort and a sense of the 
inappropriateness about the assigned 
sex.’’ DSM–III–R at 71. It even lists such 
distress as the first diagnostic criteria for 
gender identity disorder. Id. at 73, 77. This language makes clear that gender 
identity disorders, as understood in 
1990, included distress and discomfort 
from identifying as a gender different 
from the sex assigned at birth and thus 
encompasses ‘‘gender dysphoria.’’ See 
Williams, 45 F.4th at 784 (Quattlebaum, J. dissenting); see also Kincaid, 600 U.S 
.,143 S.Ct. at 2417 (Alito, J. dissenting 
from denial of certiorari) (noting that the 
‘‘broad brush used by Congress’’ in 
crafting the language of Section 
12211(b)(1) suggests Congressional 
intent to ‘‘prohibit the ADA’s 
application to conditions that are 
sufficiently similar to the more specific 
categories of conditions’’ identified). 
Several federal courts agree with this 
interpretation. See, e.g., Parker v. Strawser Constr., Inc., 307 F. Supp. 3d 
744, 754 (S.D. Ohio 2018) (surveying 
cases and finding that ‘‘[t]he majority of 
federal cases have concluded’’ that the 
ADA excludes from its protection ‘‘both 
disabling and non-disabling gender 
identity disorders that do not result 
from a physical impairment’’); Duncan 
v. Jack Henry Assocs., Inc., 617 F. Supp. 3d 1011, 1056–57 (W.D. Mo. 2022) 
(concluding that ADA’s exclusion of 
gender identity disorders 
‘‘encompass[ed] Plaintiff’s diagnosis of 
gender dysphoria’’); Lange v. Houston Cnty., Georgia, 608 F. Supp. 3d 1340, 
1361–63 (M.D. Ga. 2022) (holding that 
gender dysphoria not resulting from 
physical impairment is subject to the 
gender identity disorder exclusion); Doe 
v. Northrop Grumman Sys. Corp., 418 F. Supp. 3d 921, 930 (N.D. Ala. 2019) 
(same). 
Accordingly, under a review of the 
definition of disability as written in 29 
U.S.C. 705(20)(A) and (F)(i), 
independent of HHS’ 2024 Final Rule 
and preamble, many courts have 
reached the conclusion that the best 
reading of the statute is that ‘‘disability’’ 
does not include gender dysphoria not 
resulting from physical impairments. 
Even if a court considers there to be 
ambiguity as to whether gender identity 
disorders not resulting from physical 
impairments includes gender dysphoria 
not resulting from physical 
impairments, ‘‘there is a best reading all 
the same—‘the reading the court would 
have reached’ if no agency were 
involved.’’
8
This proposed rulemaking 
rectifies the overreach committed by the 
2024 Final Rule preamble and 
recognizes the the interpretation of 
‘‘disability’’ set by Congress and the 
courts as required by the Administrative 
Procedures Act.

Reasons for the Proposed Rulemaking 
The Department is issuing this NPRM 
to address a targeted but consequential 
gap in regulatory clarity created by the 
2024 Final Rule’s preamble. Although 
the operative regulation at 45 CFR 
84.4(g) cross-references the statutory 
exclusion for ‘‘gender identity disorders 
not resulting from physical 
impairments,’’ the preamble’s general 
discussion of gender dysphoria 
introduced interpretative confusion 
regarding how the exclusion applies to 
that condition. The Department has 
determined that this ambiguity warrants 
regulatory resolution. 
When Congress clearly excluded 
‘‘gender identity disorders not resulting 
from physical impairments,’’ federal 
agencies and courts are bound to apply 
that exclusion as written, unless and 
until Congress amends the underlying 
statute. Here, the Rehabilitation Act and 
the ADA expressly exclude ‘‘gender 
identity disorders not resulting from 
physical impairments’’ from the 
definitions of ‘‘disability’’ and

90 FR 15412 (Apr. 11, 2025). 
11
See generally 5 U.S.C. 601, et. seq. 
‘‘individual with a disability.’’ 29 U.S.C. 
705(9) & (20)(F)(i); 42 U.S.C. 
12211(b)(1). OCR does not have the 
authority to broaden or narrow these 
statutory exclusions through agency 
rulemaking. This is in part because the 
Administrative Procedure Act requires 
federal courts to ‘‘hold unlawful and set 
aside’’ agency actions taken ‘‘in excess 
of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or 
limitations.’’ 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(C). 
Therefore, to remedy the ambiguity and 
reduce litigation risk, we are issuing this 
proposed rule to clarify that, where 
‘‘gender identity disorders not resulting 
from physical impairments’’ is used in 
part 84, it encompasses ‘‘gender 
dysphoria not resulting from physical 
impairments,’’ because the statutory text 
states as much. 
The Department maintains that the 
preamble language of the 2024 Final 
Rule lacks the force and effect of law 
and is not enforceable. However, we 
recognize that this proposed rule comes 
to a different conclusion on whether 
‘‘gender dysphoria’’ not resulting from 
physical impairment may be a disability 
under section 504 compared to that 
preamble. 
The Department is issuing this rule 
because it has reevaluated the relevant 
statutory language and determined that 
the term ‘‘gender dysphoria not 
resulting from physical impairments’’ is 
encompassed in the term ‘‘gender 
identity disorder not resulting from 
physical impairments,’’ as that term is 
used in the ADA and in section 504, 
based on the plain language of the 
statutory exclusions from the definitions 
of ‘‘disability’’ and ‘‘individual with a 
disability’’ in the context of existing 
medical terminology at the time of the 
ADA’s enactment. The discussion in the 
preamble of the 2024 final rule focused 
almost exclusively on the Williams 
majority opinion and its determination 
that the current definition of gender 
dysphoria is not interchangeable with 
the definition of gender identity 
disorder from 1990. 45 F.4th 759. After 
careful consideration, the Department 
recognizes that the evolving medical 
classifications of gender disorders 
cannot change the meaning of the 
statutory language. 
Because the preamble lacks the force 
and effect of law and is not enforceable, 
the Department expects that any 
reliance interests are minimal. To the 
extent anyone relied on that language, 
however, they have no legitimate 
reliance interests in maintaining that 
language, and indeed would be harmed 
by its continuation. Since the preamble 
language is not enforceable and lacks 
the force of law, no one can use it to 
their benefit. Meanwhile, individuals 
may unintentionally believe that the 
preamble language can override 
statutory language. By fixing the 
incorrect language in the preamble, the 
Department is ensuing that no one 
incorrectly relies on the mistaken 
interpretation to their detriment. 
Alternatives Considered 
While the Department believes that 
rulemaking to clarify that the definitions 
of ‘‘disability’’ and ‘‘individual with a 
disability’’ in Section 504 exclude 
‘‘gender dysphoria not resulting from 
physical impairments’’ is the most 
prudent course of action, we considered 
a host of alternatives. 
The first alternative to rulemaking 
considered was to simply leave the 
existing preamble language in place and 
maintain the Department’s position that 
the preamble language is not binding or 
legally enforceable, as stated in the 
April 11, 2025 notice in the Federal 
Register.
10
While this approach would 
result in less rulemaking for the 
Department and may ultimately result 
in the same outcome as this rulemaking 
in hypothetical future litigation, it 
would do little to rectify the ambiguity 
surrounding the definition of 
‘‘disability’’ caused by the preamble to 
the 2024 Final Rule. The Department 
believes that the 2024 Final Rule 
Preamble has generated significant 
confusion and that the only way to 
rectify such confusion is to modify the 
text. 
The second alternative considered 
was to issue guidance further explaining 
to the public that the Department 
interpreted the exclusion for ‘‘gender 
identity disorders not resulting from 
physical impairments’’ to include 
‘‘gender dysphoria not resulting from 
physical impairments.’’ Similar to the 
first alternative, the Department 
determined that guidance alone would 
be insufficient to rectify the existing 
confusion, and the public would 
question why contradictory preamble 
language still existed. 
The final alternative considered was a 
full repeal of the 2024 Final Rule. While 
this method would have eliminated the 
confusion caused by the preamble 
language, such an approach would be 
broader than necessary to address the 
issue presented by the preamble on 
whether ‘‘disability’’ included or 
excluded ‘‘gender dysphoria not 
resulting from physical impairment.’’ 
The Department requests comments on 
these alternatives considered.

this rulemaking has been designated as 
a significant regulatory action under

12866. Accordingly, the rule has been 
reviewed by the Office of Management 
and Budget. 
Executive Order 12250 on Leadership

Pursuant to Executive Order 12250, 
the Attorney General has the 
responsibility to ‘‘coordinate the 
implementation and enforcement by 
Executive agencies of . . . ‘‘[a]ny other 
provision of Federal statutory law 
which provides, in whole or in part, that 
no person in the United States shall, on 
the ground of race, color, national 
origin, handicap, religion, or sex, be 
excluded from participation in, be 
denied the benefits of, or be subject to 
discrimination under any program or 
activity receiving Federal financial 
assistance.’’ Executive Order 12250 at 
§ 1–201(d), 45 FR 72995 (Nov. 2, 1980). 
The NPRM was reviewed and approved 
by the Attorney General. 
RFA—Initial Small Entity Analysis 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 
Public Law 96–354, applies to rules for 
which an agency publishes a general 
notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)

Because 
this proposed rule would clarify a single 
limited aspect of the definitions of 
‘‘disability’’ and ‘‘individual with a 
disability’’ under section 504, any 
associated costs to recipients, including 
small entities, would be negligible. 
Recipients would not have to purchase 
new equipment, alter benefits, or change 
their practices in any way based on this 
clarification. The Department certifies 
that this proposed rule would not have 
a significant effect on small entities. 
Executive Order 13132: Federalism 
Executive Order 13132 establishes 
certain requirements that an agency 
must meet when it promulgates a rule 
that imposes substantial direct 
requirement costs on State and local 
governments or has federalism 
implications. The Department has 
determined that this proposed rule does 
not impose such costs or have any 
Federalism implications.

Executive Order 13175 requires 
Federal agencies to consult and 
coordinate with Tribes on a 
government-to-government basis on 
policies that have Tribal implications, 
including regulations, legislative 
comments, proposed legislation, and 
other policy statements or actions that 
have substantial direct effects on one or 
more Indian Tribes, on the relationship 
between the Federal Government and 
Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of 
power and responsibilities between the 
Federal Government and Indian Tribes. 
Because this rulemaking would only 
clarify whether ‘‘gender dysphoria not 
resulting from physical impairment’’ 
may be included in the definitions of 
‘‘disability’’ and ‘‘individual with a 
disability’’ and will not have a 
significant effect on Tribal finances or 
the relationship between the Federal 
Government and Indian Tribes, the 
Department has determined that this 
rulemaking would not have Tribal 
implications that require consultation 
under Executive Order 13175. 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
In accordance with the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. ch. 
3506; 5 CFR part 1320 appendix A.1), 
the Department has reviewed this 
proposed rule and has determined that 
there are no new or modified collections 
of information contained therein. 
Executive Order 14192: Deregulation 
Under Executive Order 14192, 
Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation, executive agencies are 
required to limit the costs of planned 
regulations, including by repealing 
existing regulations for each newly 
promulgated regulation and/or 
prioritizing regulations with minimal 
costs or burdens. This proposed rule 
will not impose new costs or burdens on 
recipients as it will result in a 
clarification made necessary by the 
preamble language of the 2024 Final 
Rule that called into question whether 
gender dysphoria could be considered a 
disability. 
Request for Comment 
The Department seeks comment on all 
issues raised by the proposed rule. 
Additionally, the Department seeks 
comments on any reliance interests that 
recipients of financial assistance from 
HHS, people with disabilities, or other 
entities may have related to the gender 
dysphoria discussion in the preamble of 
the 2024 Final Rule. The Department is 
especially interested in comments 
indicating that an entity has changed its 
policies, practices, or procedures to 
account for the 2024 Final Rule gender 
dysphoria preamble language and how 
this rulemaking would affect the entity. 
The Department also seeks comments 
on the regulatory alternatives it 
considered in Section IV of this notice 
of proposed rulemaking and the 
Department’s decision to pursue this 
rulemaking.

I. Abstract 
The U.S. Census Bureau seeks a 
revision for the American Community 
Survey (ACS) and the Puerto Rico 
Community Survey (PRCS). 
Since its founding, the Census Bureau 
has balanced the demands of a growing 
country requiring information about its 
people and economy with concerns for 
respondents’ confidentiality and the 
time and effort it takes respondents to 
answer questions. Beginning with the 
1810 Census, Congress updated the set 
of questions asked in the 1790 and 1800 
Censuses by adding questions to 
support a range of public concerns and 
uses. Over the course of a century, 
federal agencies requested to add 
questions about agriculture, industry, 
and commerce, as well as individuals’ 
occupation, ancestry, marital status, 
disabilities, place of birth, and other 
topics. In 1940, the Census Bureau 
introduced the long-form census 
questionnaire to ask more detailed 
questions from a sample of the public. 
In the early 1990s, the demand for 
current, nationally consistent data from 
a wide variety of data users led federal 
government policymakers to consider 
the feasibility of collecting social, 
economic, housing, and demographic 
data continuously throughout the 
decade. The benefits of providing 
current data, along with the anticipated 
decennial census benefits in cost 
savings, planning, improved census 
coverage, and more efficient operations, 
led the Census Bureau to plan the 
implementation of the Continuous 
Measurement Survey, later called the 
American Community Survey (ACS). 
After years of testing, the ACS was 
implemented in 2005, replacing the 
need for long-form data collection in 
future decennial censuses. The ACS is 
conducted throughout the United States 
including in Puerto Rico, where it is 
called the Puerto Rico Community 
Survey (PRCS). The ACS samples 
approximately 3.5 million housing unit 
addresses in the United States and about 
36,000 in Puerto Rico each year. A 
housing unit is a house, an apartment, 
a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a 
single room occupied or intended for 
occupancy as separate living quarters. 
The ACS also collects detailed data from 
a sample of about 150,000 residents 
living in group quarters facilities in the 
United States and about 600 in Puerto 
Rico. Group quarters are places where 
people live or stay in a group living 
arrangement owned or managed by an 
entity or organization providing housing 
and/or services for the residents. People 
living in group quarters usually are not 
related to each other. Group quarters 
include college/university student 
housing, residential treatment centers, 
skilled nursing facilities, group homes, 
military barracks, correctional facilities, 
workers’ group living quarters, Job 
Corps centers, and emergency and 
transitional shelters. 
The ACS program provides estimates 
annually for the nation, all states, the 
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, 
congressional districts, metropolitan 
areas, and counties and places with a 
population of 65,000 or more. It takes 
five years for smaller areas and 
population groups to accumulate 
enough data to provide reliable 
estimates. Every community in the 
nation continues to receive a detailed, 
statistical portrait of its social, 
economic, housing, and demographic 
characteristics each year through one- 
year and five-year ACS products. 
The ACS collects detailed social, 
economic, housing, and demographic 
data on over 40 topics. The list of topics 
and questions can be found here: 
https://www.census.gov/acs/www/ 
about/why-we-ask-each-question/. 
In 2027, the ACS plans to introduce 
an internet self-response option to the 
Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS) 
data collection operation. The Census 
Bureau believes there is value in 
offering an internet self-response option 
to households and people living in 
certain types of group quarters—

group homes, military barracks, 
workers’ group living quarters, and 
emergency and transitional shelters in 
Puerto Rico. 
In addition to the internet self- 
response option for PRCS, the proposed 
content for the 2027 ACS and PRCS 
includes the updated race and ethnicity 
question, which follows OMB’s 2024 
Statistical Policy Directive No. 15 (SPD 
15). Currently, race and ethnicity data 
are collected and tabulated following 
OMB’s 1997 SPD 15 on Federal race and 
ethnicity data standards. 
II. Method of Collection 
To encourage self-response in the 
ACS, the Census Bureau sends up to 
five mailings to housing unit addresses 
selected for the sample. The first 
mailing, sent to all mailable addresses 
in the sample, includes an invitation to 
participate in the ACS online and states 
that a paper questionnaire will be sent 
in a few weeks to those unable to 
respond online. The second mailing is 
a letter that reminds respondents to 
complete the survey online, thanks 
them if they have already done so, and 
informs them that a paper questionnaire 
will be sent later if we do not receive 
their response. In a third mailing, the 
paper questionnaire is sent only to those 
sample addresses that have not 
completed the online questionnaire 
within two weeks of receipt of the first 
mailing. The fourth mailing is a 
postcard that reminds respondents to 
respond and informs them that an 
interviewer may contact them if they do 
not complete the survey. A fifth mailing 
is sent to respondents who have not 
completed the survey within five weeks. 
This letter provides a due date and 
reminds the respondents to return their 
questionnaires in order to be removed 
from future contact. Some households 
are also contacted by email. If a 
household starts the online survey and 
gives an email but doesn’t finish the 
survey, the household will receive an 
email reminder to complete the survey. 
The new PRCS internet self-response 
option will mirror the ACS method of 
data collection. 
If the Census Bureau does not receive 
a response from an address in the first 
two months of data collection, the 
address may be selected for an in-person 
or phone interview by a Census Bureau 
field representative. This is the 
nonresponse follow-up data collection 
operation known as the Computer- 
Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) 
phase. The CAPI phase of data 
collection lasts for one month. Only a 
portion of nonresponding addresses, 
after the first two months of data 
collection, are sampled in CAPI. While 
this phase of data collection focuses on 
personal interviews, respondents still 
have the option to respond online, 
return a paper questionnaire, or call the 
Telephone Questionnaire Assistance 
line and complete the survey over the 
telephone. 
At the beginning of the CAPI month, 
a sixth mailing is sent to all mailable 
addresses in the CAPI sample. This 
letter urges respondents to complete the 
survey online to avoid an in-person 
interview. If a household responds 
online, by paper questionnaire, or by 
phone, they are removed from the 
workload and are no longer contacted. 
If they do not respond, a Census Bureau 
field representative attempts to contact 
them to obtain a response via a 
computer-assisted interview. 
The Census Bureau employs a 
separate strategy to collect data from 
group quarters. The Census Bureau 
collects data for sampled people in 
group quarters through personal 
interviews, telephone interviews, and 
internet responses. The Census Bureau 
will obtain the facility information by 
conducting a telephone or personal visit 
interview with a group quarter contact. 
During this interview, the Census 
Bureau obtains a roster of residents and 
randomly selects them for person-level 
interviews. The facility can also upload 
their facility roster to the Census Bureau 
online listing application. During the 
person-level phase, a field 
representative uses a computer-assisted 
personal interview automated 
instrument to collect detailed 
information for each sampled resident. 
The field representative also has the 
option to distribute a questionnaire to 
residents for self-response if they are 
unable to complete a computer-assisted 
personal interview. Respondents in 
some group quarters also have the 
option to self-respond to the survey 
online.

I. Abstract 
This collection of information 
involves miscellaneous licensing and 
reporting requirements as well as 
enforcement activities that are 
associated with the export, reexport or 
transfer of items controlled by the 
Department of Commerce’s Bureau of 
Industry and Security (BIS). BIS is 
revising the title of this collection of 
information to better reflect the scope of 
requirements associated with licensing 
and enforcement found in Parts 744, 748 
and 758 of the Export Administration 
Regulations (EAR). Some of these 
activities involve submission of 
documents to BIS as well as exchange 
of documents among parties in the 
export transaction to ensure that each 
party understands its obligations under 
U.S. law. Others involve writing certain 
export control statements on shipping 
documents or reporting unforeseen 
changes in shipping and disposition of 
exported commodities. Many of these 
activities are needed by the Office of 
Export Enforcement and U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection (CBP) to 
document export transactions, enforce 
the EAR and protect the National 
Security of the United States.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On August 29, 2025, Commerce 
published in the Federal Register its 
affirmative final determinations in the 
CVD investigations of CORE from Brazil, 
Canada, Mexico, and Vietnam.
1
On 
November 28, 2025, the ITC notified 
Commerce of its final determinations, 
pursuant to sections 705(d) of the Tariff 
Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), that 
an industry in the United States is 
materially injured within the meaning 
of section 705(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act by 
reason of imports of CORE from Brazil, 
Canada, Mexico, and Vietnam.
2
 
Scope of the Orders 
The products covered by these orders 
are CORE from Brazil, Canada, Mexico, 
and Vietnam. For a full description of 
the scope of these orders, see the appendix to this notice. 
Countervailing Duty Orders 
Based on the affirmative final 
determinations by the ITC that an 
industry in the United States is 
materially injured by reason of 
subsidized imports of CORE from Brazil, 
Canada, Mexico, and Vietnam,
3
in 
accordance with sections 705(c)(2) and 
706(a) of the Act, Commerce is issuing 
these CVD orders. Because the ITC 
determined that imports of CORE from 
Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and Vietnam 
are materially injuring a U.S. industry, 
unliquidated entries of such 
merchandise entered, or withdrawn 
from warehouse, for consumption, are 
subject to the assessment of 
countervailing duties. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 
706(a) of the Act, Commerce will direct

For the Mexico Preliminary Determination, 
Commerce did not instruct CBP to suspend 
liquidation of entries of subject merchandise for 
Galvasid S.A. de C.V (Galvasid), and for the 
Vietnam Preliminary Determination, Commerce did 
not instruct CBP to suspend liquidation for Hoa Sen 
Group (HSG) or Ton Dong A Corporation (TDA) 
because Galvasid, HSG, and TDA’s preliminary net 
countervailable subsidy rates were zero or de 
minimis. See Mexico Preliminary Determination, 90 
FR at 9227; see also Vietnam Preliminary 
Determination, 90 FR at 9236. However, Commerce instructed CBP to suspend liquidation of entries of 
subject merchandise for TDA as a result of the 
Vietnam Final Determination because TDA’s final 
net countervailable subsidy rate was above de 
minimis. See Vietnam Final Determination, 90 FR 
at 42208. Galvasid and HSG’s final net 
countervailable subsidy rates were zero and de 
minimis, respectively, and, consequently, Commerce did not instruct CBP to suspend 
liquidation of entries of subject merchandise for 
these companies. See Mexico Final Determination, 
90 FR at 42230; see also Vietnam Final 
Determination, 90 FR at 42208. 6
See section 706(a)(3) of the Act. 7
Commerce found the following companies to be 
cross owned: CSN Minerac¸a˜o S.A.; Companhia 
Energetica Chapeco; and Companhia Estadual de 
Gerac¸a˜o de Energia Ele´trica. See Mexico Preliminary Determination PDM at 6. 8
Commerce found the following companies to be 
crossed owned: Usiminas: Minerac¸a˜o Usiminas 
S.A.; Usiminas Mecaˆnica S.A; Unigal Ltda.; 
Ternium Brasil Ltda. See Mexico Preliminary 
Determination PDM at 6–7. 9
Commerce found the following companies to be 
cross-owned with ArcelorMittal Dofasco G.P.: 
ArcelorMittal Canada Holdings Inc., ArcelorMittal 
Canada Inc., ArcelorMittal Canada MP Inc., 
ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada G.P., 
ArcelorMittal Mining Canada GP, and ArcelorMittal 
Coteau-du-Lac Limited Partnership. Commerce 
notes that the Canada Final Determination listed 
both ‘‘ArcelorMittal Mining Canada GP’’ and 
‘‘ArcelorMittal Exploitation Miniere Canada 
s.e.n.c.’’ as cross-owned entities of ArcelorMittal 
Dofasco G.P.; these two names refer to the same 
entity. As such, we have removed ArcelorMittal 
Exploitation Miniere Canada s.e.n.c. (i.e., the French spelling of the name) from the list of cross- 
owned entities above.

Commerce found the following companies to be 
cross-owned: Hoa Sen Nghe An One Member 
Limited Liabilities Company; Hoa Sen Nhon Hoi— 
Binh Dinh One Member Limited Liability Company; 
Hoa Sen Phu My One Member Limited Liabilities; 
and Hoa Sen Steel One Member Company Limited. 
705(b) of the Act, as further described 
below. 
Suspension of Liquidation and Cash 
Deposits 
In accordance with section 706 of the 
Act, Commerce intends to instruct CBP 
to reinstitute the suspension of 
liquidation and continue the suspension 
of liquidation, as applicable, of CORE 
from Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and 
Vietnam, effective on the date of 
publication of the ITC’s final affirmative 
injury determination in the Federal 
Register, and to assess, upon further 
instruction by Commerce, pursuant to 
section 706(a)(1) of the Act, 
countervailing duties on each entry of 
subject merchandise in an amount based 
on the net countervailable subsidy rates 
below.
5
These instructions suspending 
liquidation will remain in effect until 
further notice. 
Commerce also intends, pursuant to 
section 706(a)(1) of the Act, to instruct 
CBP to require cash deposits equal to 
the amounts as indicated below. 
Accordingly, effective on the date of 
publication of the ITC’s final affirmative 
injury determination in the Federal 
Register, CBP will require, at the same 
time as importers would normally 
deposit estimated customs duties on the 
subject merchandise, a cash deposit for 
each entry of subject merchandise equal 
to the subsidy rates listed below.
6
The 
all-others rates apply to all producers or 
exporters not specifically listed below, 
as appropriate. 
Because the countervailable subsidy 
rates are zero and de minimis for subject 
merchandise produced and exported by 
Galvasid and HSG, respectively, entries 
of shipments of subject merchandise 
from these producers/exporters are 
excluded from the countervailing duty 
orders on subject merchandise from 
Mexico and Vietnam. 
Estimated Countervailable Subsidy 
Rates 
The estimated countervailable 
subsidy rates are as follows:

See Preliminary Determinations. 
12
As discussed above, Commerce did not instruct 
CBP to suspend liquidation of entries of subject 
merchandise for Galvasid (Mexico), HSG (Vietnam), 
or TDA (Vietnam) because the net countervailable 
subsidy rates for these companies were zero or de 
minimis. See Mexico Preliminary Determination, 90 
FR at 9227; see also Vietnam Preliminary 
Determination, 90 FR at 9236. However, Commerce instructed CBP to suspend liquidation of entries of 
subject merchandise for TDA as a result of the 
Vietnam Final Determination because TDA’s final 
net countervailable subsidy rate was above de 
minimis. See Vietnam Final Determination, 90 FR 
at 42208. Therefore, the discontinuation of 
suspension of liquidation as a result of the 
expiration of provisional measures, as described in 
this section, does not apply to TDA for which 
provisional measures remain in effect.

This segment will be combined with the

which will display the month in which the notice 
of the order or suspended investigation was 
published in the Federal Register, also known as 
the anniversary month. For example, for an order 
under case number A–000–000 that was published 
in the Federal Register in January, the relevant 
segment and SSI combination will appear in 
ACCESS as ‘‘AISL—January Anniversary.’’ Note 
that there will be only one annual inquiry service 
list segment per case number, and the anniversary 
month will be pre-populated in ACCESS. 
17
See Final Rule, 86 FR at 52335. 
Provisional Measures 
Section 703(d) of the Act states that 
the suspension of liquidation pursuant 
to an affirmative preliminary 
determination may not remain in effect 
for more than four months. In the 
underlying investigations, Commerce 
published the Preliminary 
Determinations on February 10, 2025.11
 
As such, the four-month period 
beginning on the date of the publication 
of the Preliminary Determinations 
ended on June 9, 2025. Therefore, 
entries of CORE from Brazil, Canada, 
Mexico, and Vietnam made on or after 
June 10, 2025, and prior to the date of 
publication of the ITC’s final 
determinations in the Federal Register, 
are not subject to the assessment of 
countervailing duties due to 
Commerce’s discontinuation of the 
suspension of liquidation.
12
 
In accordance with section 703(d) of 
the Act, Commerce instructed CBP to 
terminate the suspension of liquidation 
and to liquidate, without regard to 
countervailing duties, certain 
unliquidated entries of CORE from 
Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and Vietnam 
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, 
for consumption on or after June 10, 
2025, the date on which the provisional 
CVD measures expired, until and 
through the day preceding the date of 
publication of the ITC’s final injury 
determinations in the Federal Register. 
Suspension of liquidation and the 
collection of cash deposits will resume 
on the date of publication of the ITC 
final injury determinations in the 
Federal Register. 
Establishment of the Annual Inquiry 
Service List 
On September 20, 2021, Commerce 
published the Final Rule in the Federal 
Register.
13
On September 27, 2021, 
Commerce also published the 
Procedural Guidance in the Federal 
Register.
14
The Final Rule and Procedural Guidance provide that 
Commerce will maintain an annual 
inquiry service list for each order or 
suspended investigation, and any 
interested party submitting a scope 
ruling application or request for 
circumvention inquiry shall serve a 
copy of the application or request on the 
persons on the annual inquiry service 
list for that order, as well as any 
companion order covering the same 
merchandise from the same country of 
origin.
15
 
In accordance with the Procedural 
Guidance, for orders published in the Federal Register after November 4, 
2021, Commerce will create an annual 
inquiry service list segment in 
Commerce’s online e-filing and 
document management system, 
Antidumping and Countervailing Duty 
Electronic Service System (ACCESS), 
available at https://access.trade.gov, 
within five business days of publication 
of the order. Each annual inquiry 
service list will be saved in ACCESS, 
under each case number, and under a 
specific segment type called ‘‘AISL- 
Annual Inquiry Service List.’’
16
 
Interested parties who wish to be 
added to the annual inquiry service list 
for an order must submit an entry of 
appearance to the annual inquiry 
service list segment for the order in 
ACCESS within 30 days after the date of 
publication of the order. For ease of 
administration, Commerce requests that 
law firms with more than one attorney 
representing interested parties in an 
order designate a lead attorney to be 
included on the annual inquiry service 
list. Commerce will finalize the annual 
inquiry service list within five business 
days thereafter. As mentioned in the 
Procedural Guidance, the new annual 
inquiry service list will be in place until 
the following year, when the 
Opportunity Notice for the anniversary 
month of the order is published. 
Commerce may update an annual 
inquiry service list at any time as 
needed based on interested parties’ 
amendments to their entries of 
appearance to remove or otherwise 
modify their list of members and 
representatives, or to update contact 
information. Any changes or 
announcements pertaining to these 
procedures will be posted to the 
ACCESS website. 
Special Instructions for Petitioners and 
Foreign Governments 
In the Final Rule, Commerce stated 
that, ‘‘after an initial request and 
placement on the annual inquiry service 
list, both petitioners and foreign 
governments will automatically be 
placed on the annual inquiry service list 
in the years that follow.’’
17
 
Accordingly, as stated above, the 
petitioners and foreign governments 
should submit their initial entry of 
appearance after publication of this 
notice in order to appear in the first 
annual inquiry service list. Pursuant to 
19 CFR 351.225(n)(3), the petitioners 
and foreign governments will not need 
to resubmit their entries of appearance 
each year to continue to be included on 
the annual inquiry service list. 
However, the petitioners and foreign 
governments are responsible for making 
amendments to their entries of 
appearance during the annual update to 
the annual inquiry service list in 
accordance with the procedures 
described above. 
Notification to Interested Parties 
This notice constitutes the CVD 
orders with respect to CORE from 
Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and Vietnam, 
pursuant to section 706(a) of the Act. 
Interested parties can find a list of CVD 
orders currently in effect at https://
www.trade.gov/data-visualization/ 
adcvd-proceedings. 
These CVD orders are published in 
accordance with section 706(a) of the 
Act and 19 CFR 351.211(b).

successively superimposed layers, spirally 
oscillating, etc.). The products covered also include products not in coils (e.g., in straight lengths) of a thickness less than 4.75 mm and 
a width that is 12.7 mm or greater and that 
measures at least 10 times the thickness. The 
products covered also include products not 
in coils (e.g., in straight lengths) of a thickness of 4.75 mm or more and a width 
exceeding 150 mm and measuring at least 
twice the thickness. The products described 
above may be rectangular, square, circular, or 
other shape and include products of either 
rectangular or non-rectangular cross-section 
where such cross-section is achieved 
subsequent to the rolling process, i.e., 
products which have been ‘‘worked after 
rolling’’ (e.g., products which have been beveled or rounded at the edges). 
For purposes of the width and thickness 
requirements referenced above: 
(1) Where the nominal and actual 
measurements vary, a product is within the 
scope if application of either the nominal or 
actual measurement would place it within 
the scope based on the definitions set forth 
above, and 
(2) where the width and thickness vary for 
a specific product (e.g., the thickness of certain products with non-rectangular cross- 
section, the width of certain products with 
non-rectangular shape, etc.), the 
measurement at its greatest width or 
thickness applies. 
Steel products included in the scope of 
these orders are products in which: (1) iron 
predominates, by weight, over each of the 
other contained elements; and (2) the carbon 
content is 2 percent or less, by weight. 
Subject merchandise also includes 
corrosion-resistant steel that has been further 
processed in a third country, including but 
not limited to annealing, tempering, painting, 
varnishing, trimming, cutting, punching and/ 
or slitting or any other processing that would 
not otherwise remove the merchandise from 
the scope of the orders if performed in the 
country of manufacture of the in-scope 
corrosion resistant steel. 
All products that meet the written physical 
description are within the scope of these 
orders unless specifically excluded. The 
following products are outside of and/or 
specifically excluded from the scope of these 
orders: 
€Flat-rolled steel products either plated or coated with tin, lead, chromium, chromium 
oxides, both tin and lead (‘‘terne plate’’) or 
both chromium and chromium oxides (‘‘tin 
free steel’’), whether or not painted, 
varnished or coated with plastics or other 
non-metallic substances in addition to the 
metallic coating; 
€Clad products in straight lengths of 4.7625 mm or more in composite thickness 
and of a width which exceeds 150 mm and 
measures at least twice the thickness; 
€Certain clad stainless flat-rolled products, which are three-layered corrosion- 
resistant carbon steel flat-rolled products less 
than 4.75 mm in composite thickness that 
consist of a carbon steel flat-rolled product 
clad on both sides with stainless steel in a 
20%-60%-20% ratio; and

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On April 11, 2025, Commerce 
published in the Federal Register the 
Preliminary Results and invited 
interested parties to comment.
1
On 
August 1, 2025, Commerce extended the 
deadline to issue its final results for this 
review by 60 days to no later than 
October 8, 2025.
2
Due to the lapse in 
appropriations and Federal Government 
shutdown, on November 14, 2025, 
Commerce tolled all deadlines in 
administrative proceedings by 47 days.
3
 
Additionally, due to a backlog of 
documents that were electronically filed 
via Enforcement and Compliance’s 
Antidumping and Countervailing Duty 
Centralized Electronic Service System 
(ACCESS) during the Federal 
Government shutdown, on November 
24, 2025, Commerce tolled all deadlines 
in administrative proceedings by an 
additional 21 days.
4
Accordingly, the 
deadline for these final results is now 
December 15, 2025. For a complete 
description of the events that followed 
the initiation of this review, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum.

The products covered by the Order 
are MAE from China. For a complete 
description of the scope of the Order, 
see the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
Analysis of Subsidy Programs and 
Comments Received 
A list of the issues that parties raised, 
to which we responded in the Issues 
and Decision Memorandum, is included 
as an appendix to this notice. The Issues 
and Decision Memorandum is a public 
document and is on file electronically 
via Enforcement and Compliance’s 
Antidumping and Countervailing Duty 
Centralized Electronic Service System 
(ACCESS). ACCESS is available to 
registered users at https://
access.trade.gov. In addition, a complete version of the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum can be accessed directly 
at https://access.trade.gov/public/FRNoticesListLayout.aspx. 
Changes Since the Preliminary Results 
Based on our review and analysis of 
comments received from parties, for 
these final results, we made certain 
changes to the countervailable subsidy 
rate calculations for Dingli. For a 
discussion of these changes, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
Methodology 
Commerce is conducting this review 
in accordance with section 751(a)(1)(A) 
of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended 
(the Act). For each of the subsidy 
programs found countervailable, we 
find that there is a subsidy, i.e., a financial contribution by a government 
or public entity that gives rise to a 
benefit to the recipient, and that the 
subsidy is specific.

accordance with 19 CFR 351.224(b). 
Assessment Rates 
Pursuant to section 751(a)(2)(C) of the 
Act and 19 CFR 351.212(b)(2), 
Commerce has determined, and U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
shall assess, countervailing duties on all 
appropriate entries of subject 
merchandise in accordance with the 
final results of this review, for the 
above-listed companies at the applicable 
ad valorem assessment rates. We intend 
to issue assessment instructions to CBP 
no earlier than 35 days after the date of 
publication of these final results of 
review in the Federal Register. If a 
timely summons is filed at the U.S. 
Court of International Trade, the 
assessment instructions will direct CBP 
not to liquidate relevant entries until the 
time for parties to file a request for a 
statutory injunction has expired (i.e., 
within 90 days of publication). 
Cash Deposit Requirements 
In accordance with section 
751(a)(2)(C) of the Act, Commerce also 
intends to instruct CBP to collect cash 
deposits of estimated countervailing 
duties in the amounts shown for each of 
the respective companies listed above 
on shipments of subject merchandise 
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, 
for consumption on or after the date of 
publication of the final results of this 
administrative review.
9
For all non- 
reviewed firms subject to the Order, we will instruct CBP to continue to collect 
cash deposits of estimated 
countervailing duties at the most recent 
company-specific or all-others rate 
applicable to the company, as 
appropriate. These cash deposit 
requirements, effective upon 
publication of these final results, shall 
remain in effect until further notice. 
Administrative Protective Order (APO) 
This notice also serves as a reminder 
to parties subject to an APO of their 
responsibility concerning the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On August 29, 2025, Commerce 
published its affirmative final 
determinations in the LTFV 
investigations of CORE from Australia, 
Brazil, Canada, Mexico, the 
Netherlands, South Africa, Taiwan, 
Tu¨rkiye, the United Arab Emirates, and 
Vietnam in accordance with sections 
735(d) and 777(i) of the Tariff Act of 
1930, as amended (the Act).
1
In the 
LTFV investigations of CORE from 
Brazil and Mexico, interested parties 
timely alleged that Commerce made 
certain ministerial errors. See 
‘‘Amendment to the Brazil Final 
Determination of Sales at Less than Fair 
Value’’ and ‘‘Amendment to the Mexico 
Final Determination of Sales at Less 
than Fair Value’’ sections below for 
further discussion. 
On November 28, 2025, pursuant to 
sections 735(d) of the Act, the ITC 
notified Commerce of its final 
affirmative determinations that an 
industry in the United States is 
materially injured within the meaning 
of section 735(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act by 
reason of dumped imports of CORE 
from Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, 
the Netherlands, South Africa, Taiwan, 
Tu¨rkiye, the United Arab Emirates, and 
Vietnam.
2
 
Scope of the Orders 
The product covered by these orders 
is CORE from Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
Mexico, the Netherlands, South Africa, 
Taiwan, Tu¨rkiye, the United Arab 
Emirates, and Vietnam. For a complete 
description of the scope of the orders, 
see the appendix to this notice. Amendment to the Final Determination 
of Sales at LTFV for Brazil 
We determine that we made a 
ministerial error in the final 
determination of sales at LTFV for 
Brazil. Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.224(e), 
and as explained further in the Brazil 
Ministerial Error Memorandum,
3
 
Commerce is amending the Brazil Final 
Determination to reflect the correction of a ministerial error.
4
Correction of this 
error changes the final AD adjusted cash 
deposit rate for Usiminas Siderugicas de 
Minas Gerais S.A., as well as the cash 
deposit rate for all other producers and 
exporters not individually investigated. 
The revised rates are listed in the 
‘‘Estimated Weighted-Average Dumping 
Margins’’ section, below. 
Amendment to the Final Determination 
of Sales at LTFV for Mexico 
We determine that we made a 
ministerial error in the final 
determination of sales at LTFV for 
Mexico. Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.224(e), 
and as explained further in the Mexico 
Ministerial Error Memorandum,
5
 
Commerce is amending the Mexico 
Final Determination to reflect the 
correction of a ministerial error.
6
 
Correction of this error changes the final 
AD adjusted cash deposit rate for 
Galvasid S.A. de C.V./Perfiles LM, S.A. 
de C.V., as well as the cash deposit rate 
for all other producers and exporters not 
individually investigated. The revised 
rates are listed in the ‘‘Estimated 
Weighted-Average Dumping Margins’’ 
section, below. 
AD Orders 
Based on the above-referenced 
affirmative final determinations, in 
accordance with section 735(c)(2) of the 
Act, Commerce is issuing these AD 
orders. Because the ITC determined that 
an industry in the United States is 
materially injured by reason of imports 
of CORE from Australia, Brazil, Canada,

Emirates, and Vietnam, unliquidated 
entries of such merchandise from these 
countries, entered or withdrawn from 
warehouse for consumption, are subject 
to the assessment of antidumping 
duties. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 
736(a)(1) of the Act, Commerce will 
direct U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) to assess, upon further 
instruction by Commerce, antidumping 
duties equal to the amount by which the 
normal value of the merchandise 
exceeds the export price (or constructed 
export price) of the merchandise on all 
relevant entries of CORE from Australia, 
Brazil, Canada, Mexico, the 
Netherlands, South Africa, Taiwan, 
Tu¨rkiye, the United Arab Emirates, and 
Vietnam. Antidumping duties will be 
assessed on unliquidated entries of 
CORE entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption on or after 
April 10, 2025, the date of publication 
of the Preliminary Determinations,
7
but 
will not include entries occurring after 
the expiration of the provisional 
measures period and before publication 
of the ITC’s final injury determination, 
as further described below. 
Suspension of Liquidation and Cash 
Deposits 
In accordance with section 736 of the 
Act, Commerce intends to instruct CBP 
to reinstitute the suspension of 
liquidation and continue the suspension 
of liquidation, as applicable, on all 
relevant entries of CORE from Australia, 
Brazil, Canada, Mexico, the 
Netherlands, South Africa, Taiwan, 
Tu¨rkiye, the United Arab Emirates, and 
Vietnam, effective on the date of 
publication of the ITC’s final affirmative 
injury determination in the Federal 
Register. Commerce also intends to 
instruct CBP to require cash deposits 
equal to the estimated weighted-average 
dumping margins indicated in the table 
below. These instructions suspending 
liquidation and cash deposit 
requirements will remain in effect until 
further notice. 
Commerce also intends to instruct 
CBP to require cash deposits equal to 
the estimated weighted-average 
dumping margins indicated in the tables 
below, adjusted by the relevant subsidy 
offsets. Accordingly, effective on the 
date of publication in the Federal 
Register of the notice of the ITC’s final affirmative injury determination, CBP 
will require, at the same time as 
importers would normally deposit 
estimated customs duties on subject 
merchandise, a cash deposit equal to the 
dumping rates listed in the tables below. 
The all-others rate for each country 
applies to all producers or exporters not 
specifically listed, as appropriate. 
Critical Circumstances 
Because the final critical 
circumstances determination for CORE 
from the United Arab Emirates was 
negative, in accordance with section 
735(c)(3) of the Act, we will instruct 
CBP to terminate the retroactive 
suspension of liquidation ordered at the 
Preliminary Determination for all other 
producers/exporters and to refund any 
cash deposits required with respect to 
entries of subject merchandise covered 
by the retroactive suspension of 
liquidation.

Provisional Measures 
Section 733(d) of the Act states that 
suspension of liquidation pursuant to an 
affirmative preliminary determination 
may not remain in effect for more than 
four months, except where exporters 
representing a significant proportion of 
exports of the subject merchandise 
request that Commerce extend the four- 
month period to no more than six 
months. At the request of exporters that 
accounted for a significant proportion of 
exports of CORE from Australia, Brazil, 
Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, South 
Africa, Taiwan, Tu¨rkiye, the United 
Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, Commerce 
extended the four-month period to no 
more than six-months.
8
 
In the underlying investigations, 
Commerce published the Preliminary 
Determinations on April 10, 2025. Therefore, the six-month period 
beginning on the date of the publication 
of the AD Preliminary Determinations 
ended on October 6, 2025. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 733(d) of the 
Act and our practice, Commerce will 
instruct CBP to terminate the 
suspension of liquidation and to 
liquidate, without regard to 
antidumping duties, unliquidated 
entries of CORE from Australia, Brazil, 
Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, South 
Africa, Taiwan, Tu¨rkiye, the United 
Arab Emirates, and Vietnam entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse, for 
consumption on or after October 7, 
2025, the day on which the provisional 
AD measures expired, until and through 
the day preceding the date of 
publication of the ITC’s final injury 
determinations in the Federal Register. 
Suspension of liquidation and the 
collection of cash deposits will resume 
on the date of publication of the ITC’s 
final determinations in the Federal 
Register. 
Establishment of the Annual Inquiry 
Service Lists 
On September 20, 2021, Commerce 
published the Final Rule in the Federal 
Register.
9
On September 27, 2021, 
Commerce also published the 
Procedural Guidance in the Federal 
Register.
10
The Final Rule and Procedural Guidance provide that 
Commerce will maintain an annual 
inquiry service list for each order or 
suspended investigation, and any 
interested party submitting a scope 
ruling application or request for 
circumvention inquiry shall serve a 
copy of the application or request on the 
persons on the annual inquiry service 
list for that order, as well as any 
companion order covering the same 
merchandise from the same country of 
origin. 
In accordance with the Procedural 
Guidance, for orders published in the Federal Register after November 4, 
2021, Commerce will create an annual 
inquiry service list segment in 
Commerce’s online e-filing and 
document management system, 
Antidumping and Countervailing Duty 
Electronic Service System (ACCESS), 
available at https://access.trade.gov, 
within five business days of publication 
of the notice of the order. Each annual 
inquiry service list will be saved in 
ACCESS, under each case number, and 
under a specific segment type called 
‘‘AISL-Annual Inquiry Service List.’’

ACCESS as ‘‘AISL-January Anniversary.’’ Note that 
there will be only one annual inquiry service list 
segment per case number, and the anniversary 
month will be pre-populated in ACCESS. 
12
See Procedural Guidance, 86 FR at 53206. 
13
See Final Rule, 86 FR at 52335. 
Interested parties who wish to be 
added to the annual inquiry service list 
for an order must submit an entry of 
appearance to the annual inquiry 
service list segment for the order in 
ACCESS within 30 days after the date of 
publication of the order. For ease of 
administration, Commerce requests that 
law firms with more than one attorney 
representing interested parties in an 
order designate a lead attorney to be 
included on the annual inquiry service 
list. Commerce will finalize the annual 
inquiry service list within five business 
days thereafter. As mentioned in the 
Procedural Guidance,
12
the new annual 
inquiry service list will be in place until 
the following year, when the 
Opportunity Notice for the anniversary 
month of the order is published. 
Commerce may update an annual 
inquiry service list at any time as 
needed based on interested parties’ 
amendments to their entries of 
appearance to remove or otherwise 
modify their list of members and 
representatives, or to update contact 
information. Any changes or 
announcements pertaining to these 
procedures will be posted to the 
ACCESS website. 
Special Instructions for the Petitioners 
and Foreign Governments 
In the Final Rule, Commerce stated 
that, ‘‘after an initial request and 
placement on the annual inquiry service 
list, both petitioners and foreign 
governments will automatically be 
placed on the annual inquiry service list 
in the years that follow.’’
13
 
Accordingly, as stated above, the 
petitioners and the Governments of 
Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, the 
Netherlands, South Africa, Taiwan, 
Tu¨rkiye, the United Arab Emirates, and 
Vietnam should submit their initial 
entries of appearance after publication 
of this notice in order to appear in the 
first annual inquiry service lists for 
these orders. Pursuant to 19 CFR 
351.225(n)(3), the petitioners and the 
Governments of Australia, Brazil, 
Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, South 
Africa, Taiwan, Tu¨rkiye, the United 
Arab Emirates, and Vietnam will not 
need to resubmit their entries of 
appearance each year to continue to be 
included on the annual inquiry service 
list. However, the petitioners and the 
Governments of Australia, Brazil, 
Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, South 
Africa, Taiwan, Tu¨rkiye, the United 
Arab Emirates, and Vietnam are 
responsible for making amendments to 
their entries of appearance during the 
annual update to the annual inquiry 
service list in accordance with the 
procedures described above. 
Notification to Interested Parties 
This notice constitutes the AD orders 
with respect to CORE from Australia, 
Brazil, Canada, Mexico, the 
Netherlands, South Africa, Taiwan, 
Tu¨rkiye, the United Arab Emirates, and 
Vietnam, pursuant to section 736(a) of 
the Act. Interested parties can find a list

Appendix 
Scope of the Orders 
The products covered by these orders are 
certain flat-rolled steel products, either clad, 
plated, or coated with corrosion-resistant 
metals such as zinc, aluminum, or zinc-, 
aluminum-, nickel- or iron-based alloys, 
whether or not corrugated or painted, 
varnished, laminated, or coated with plastics 
or other non-metallic substances in addition 
to the metallic coating. The products covered 
include coils that have a width of 12.7 mm 
or greater, regardless of form of coil (e.g., in successively superimposed layers, spirally 
oscillating, etc.). The products covered also include products not in coils (e.g., in straight lengths) of a thickness less than 4.75 mm and 
a width that is 12.7 mm or greater and that 
measures at least 10 times the thickness. The 
products covered also include products not 
in coils (e.g., in straight lengths) of a thickness of 4.75 mm or more and a width 
exceeding 150 mm and measuring at least 
twice the thickness. The products described 
above may be rectangular, square, circular, or 
other shape and include products of either 
rectangular or non-rectangular cross-section 
where such cross-section is achieved 
subsequent to the rolling process, i.e., 
products which have been ‘‘worked after 
rolling’’ (e.g., products which have been beveled or rounded at the edges). 
For purposes of the width and thickness 
requirements referenced above: 
(1) Where the nominal and actual 
measurements vary, a product is within the 
scope if application of either the nominal or 
actual measurement would place it within 
the scope based on the definitions set forth 
above, and 
(2) where the width and thickness vary for 
a specific product (e.g., the thickness of certain products with non-rectangular cross- 
section, the width of certain products with 
non-rectangular shape, etc.), the 
measurement at its greatest width or 
thickness applies. 
Steel products included in the scope of 
these orders are products in which: (1) iron 
predominates, by weight, over each of the 
other contained elements; and (2) the carbon 
content is 2 percent or less, by weight. 
Subject merchandise also includes 
corrosion-resistant steel that has been further 
processed in a third country, including but 
not limited to annealing, tempering, painting, 
varnishing, trimming, cutting, punching and/ 
or slitting or any other processing that would 
not otherwise remove the merchandise from 
the scope of the orders if performed in the 
country of manufacture of the in-scope 
corrosion resistant steel. 
All products that meet the written physical 
description are within the scope of the order 
unless specifically excluded. The following 
products are outside of and/or specifically 
excluded from the scope of these orders: 
€Flat-rolled steel products either plated or coated with tin, lead, chromium, chromium 
oxides, both tin and lead (‘‘terne plate’’) or 
both chromium and chromium oxides (‘‘tin 
free steel’’), whether or not painted, 
varnished or coated with plastics or other 
non-metallic substances in addition to the 
metallic coating; 
€Clad products in straight lengths of 4.7625 mm or more in composite thickness 
and of a width which exceeds 150 mm and 
measures at least twice the thickness; 
€Certain clad stainless flat-rolled products, which are three-layered corrosion- 
resistant carbon steel flat-rolled products less 
than 4.75 mm in composite thickness that 
consist of a carbon steel flat-rolled product 
clad on both sides with stainless steel in a 
20%–60%– 20% ratio; and 
Also excluded from the scope of the 
antidumping duty order on corrosion 
resistant steel from Taiwan are any products 
covered by the existing antidumping duty 
order on corrosion-resistant steel from 
Taiwan. See Certain Corrosion-Resistant Steel Products from India, Italy, the People’s

of China: Final Results of Changed 
Circumstances Reviews, and 
Revocation of the Antidumping and 
Countervailing Duty Orders, in Part 
AGENCY: Enforcement and Compliance, International Trade Administration, 
Department of Commerce. 
SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is issuing the 
final results of changed circumstances 
reviews (CCRs) of the antidumping duty 
(AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) 
orders on crystalline silicon 
photovoltaic (CSPV) cells, whether or 
not assembled into modules (solar 
cells), from the People’s Republic of 
China (China) to revoke the orders, in 
part, with respect to certain off-grid 
CSPV panels. 
DATES: Applicable December 19, 2025. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Maureen Shaheen, Acting Director, 
Office of Antidumping Policy, 
Enforcement and Compliance, 
International Trade Administration, 
U.S. Department of Commerce, 1401 
Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, 
DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482–3004. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On December 7, 2012, Commerce 
published the Orders on solar cells from China.
1
On September 30, 2025, 
Commerce published the initiation and 
preliminary results of these CCRs, 
finding that revocation, in part, of the 
Orders, with respect to certain off-grid CSPV panels was warranted, pursuant 
to section 751(b)(1)(A) of the Tariff Act 
of 1930, as amended (the Act), and 19 
CFR 351.216(b).
2
We also stated our 
intent to apply the partial revocation to 
unliquidated entries of merchandise 
subject to the CCRs that were entered or 
withdrawn from warehouse, for 
consumption, on or after January 1, 
2024, for the CVD Order, and December 
1, 2024, for the AD Order, and provided 
interested parties with the opportunity 
to comment on the Preliminary Results.
3
 
On November 4 and 13, 2025, we 
received comments on the Preliminary 
Results from Nextpower LLC, formerly known as Nextracker LLC (Nextpower), 
and the American Alliance for Solar 
Manufacturing (the petitioner), 
respectively.
4
 
Due to the lapse in appropriations and 
Federal Government shutdown, on 
November 14, 2025, Commerce tolled 
all deadlines in administrative 
proceedings by 47 days.
5
Additionally, 
due to a backlog of documents that were 
electronically filed via Enforcement and 
Compliance’s Antidumping and 
Countervailing Duty Centralized 
Electronic Service System (ACCESS) 
during the Federal Government 
shutdown, on November 24, 2025, 
Commerce tolled all deadlines in 
administrative proceedings by an 
additional 21 days.
6
Accordingly, the 
deadline for these final results is now 
January 21, 2026.

Final Results of CCRs and Revocation 
of the Orders, in Part 
In light of Nextpower’s request, and 
the domestic interested parties’ lack of 
interest in maintaining the Orders with respect to the products under 
consideration, Commerce continues to 
find, pursuant to sections 751(d)(1) and 
782(h)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 
351.222(g), that changed circumstances 
exist that warrant revocation of the 
Orders, in part. No interested party opposed this partial revocation. 
Moreover, no parties provided other 
information or evidence that calls into 
question the partial revocation 
described in the Preliminary Results. 
Specifically, because producers

Application of the Final Results of the 
CCRs 
In the Preliminary Results, we stated 
our intent that ‘‘we intend to apply the 
partial revocation to unliquidated 
entries of merchandise subject to the 
CCRs that were entered or withdrawn 
from warehouse, for consumption, on or 
after January 1, 2024, for the CVD Order 
and December 1, 2024, for the AD 
Order’’ because ‘‘our practice is to limit 
retroactive revocation to entries not 
covered by an ongoing administrative 
review.’’
10
However, based on our 
review of the record, including 
comments received from interested 
parties regarding our Preliminary 
Results, and for the reasons explained in the Issues and Decision Memorandum, 
in these final results of CCRs, we 
determine that it is appropriate to apply 
the partial revocation to unliquidated 
entries of merchandise subject to the 
CCRs that were entered or withdrawn 
from warehouse, for consumption, on or 
after December 1, 2022, for the AD 
Order, and January 1, 2022, for the CVD Order. For further details, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
Instructions to U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection (CBP) 
Because we determine that there are 
changed circumstances that warrant the 
revocation of the Orders, in part, we will instruct CBP to liquidate without 
regard to antidumping and 
countervailing duties, and to refund any 
estimated antidumping and 
countervailing duties deposited on all 
unliquidated entries of the merchandise 
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, 
for consumption on or after December 1, 
2022, for the AD Order, and January 1, 
2022, for the CVD Order, that are 
covered by this partial revocation of the 
Orders. Commerce will also instruct CBP to discontinue the suspension of 
liquidation and the collection of cash 
deposits for estimated antidumping and 
countervailing duties for the product 
covered by the revocation. 
Commerce intends to issue 
instructions to CBP no earlier than 35 
days after the date of publication of 
these final results of CCRs in the 
Federal Register. If a timely summons is 
filed at the U.S. Court of International 
Trade, the instructions will direct CBP 
not to liquidate relevant entries until the 
time for parties to file a request for a 
statutory injunction has expired (i.e., 
within 90 days of publication). 
Notification Regarding Administrative 
Protective Order (APO) 
This notice serves as a final reminder 
to parties subject to an APO of their 
responsibility concerning the 
disposition of proprietary information 
disclosed under an APO in accordance 
with 19 CFR 351.305(a)(3). Timely 
written notification of the return/ 
destruction of APO materials or 
conversion to a judicial protective order 
is hereby requested. Failure to comply 
with the regulations and terms of an 
APO is a sanctionable violation. 
Notification to Interested Parties 
We are issuing and publishing these 
final results of CCRs in accordance with 
sections 751(b) and 777(i) of the Act, 
and 19 CFR 351.216, 19 CFR 
351.221(c)(3), and 19 CFR 351.222(g).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On April 11, 2025, Commerce 
published the Preliminary Results in the 
Federal Register and invited interested 
parties to comment on those results.
1
 
On July 31, 2025, Commerce extended 
the deadline for issuing the final results 
of this review by 60 days until October 
8, 2025.
2
Due to the lapse in 
appropriations and Federal Government 
shutdown, on November 14, 2025, 
Commerce tolled all deadlines in 
administrative proceedings by 47 days.
3
 
Accordingly, the deadline for these final 
results of review is now November 24, 
2025. For details regarding the events 
that occurred subsequent to publication 
of the Preliminary Results in the Federal 
Register, see the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum.
4
Commerce conducted 
this administrative review in 
accordance with section 751(a) of the 
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). 
Scope of the Order 
The product covered by the Order is non-oriented electrical steel from Japan. 
For a complete description of the scope 
of the Order, see the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum. 
Analysis of Comments Received 
All issues raised in the case and 
rebuttal briefs are addressed in the 
Issues and Decision Memorandum. A 
list of the issues that parties raised and 
to which we responded in the Issues 
and Decision Memorandum is provided 
in the appendix to this notice. The 
Issues and Decision Memorandum is a 
public document and is on file 
electronically via Enforcement and 
Compliance’s Antidumping and 
Countervailing Duty Centralized 
Electronic Service System (ACCESS). 
ACCESS is available to registered users 
at https://access.trade.gov. In addition, a complete version of the Issues and 
Decision Memorandum can be accessed 
directly at https://access.trade.gov/ 
public/FRNoticesListLayout.aspx. 
Changes Since the Preliminary Results 
Based on our review of the record and 
comments received from interested 
parties regarding the Preliminary 
Results, we made certain changes to the margin calculation for NSC. 
Specifically, Commerce has applied 
partial adverse facts available (AFA) to 
NSC in these final results rather than 
total AFA. For a discussion of these 
changes, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
Final Results of Review 
Commerce determines that the 
following estimated weighted-average 
dumping margin exists for the period 
December 1, 2022, through November 
30, 2023: 
Exporter or producer 
Weighted- 
average 
dumping 
margin 
(percent) 
Nippon Steel Corporation ........... 47.80 
Disclosure 
Normally, Commerce discloses to 
parties to the proceeding the 
calculations performed in connection 
with the final results of review within 
five days of any public announcement 
of the final results of review or, if there 
is no public announcement, within five 
days of the date of publication of the 
notice of final results of review in the 
Federal Register, in accordance with 19 
CFR 351.224(b). 
Assessment of Antidumping Duties 
Pursuant to section 751(a)(2)(C) of the 
Act and 19 CFR 351.212(b)(1), 
Commerce has determined, and U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
shall assess, antidumping duties on all 
appropriate entries of subject 
merchandise covered by the final results 
of this review.
5
Specifically, Commerce 
will instruct CBP to assess antidumping 
duties on subject merchandise sold by 
NSC and entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption during the 
POR at a rate equal to the weighted- 
average dumping margin listed in the 
table above. Commerce intends to issue 
assessment instructions to CBP no 
earlier than 35 days after the publication 
date of these final results of review in 
the Federal Register. If a timely summons is filed at the U.S. Court of 
International Trade, the assessment 
instructions will direct CBP not to 
liquidate relevant entries until the time 
for parties to file a request for a statutory 
injunction has expired (i.e., within 90 days of publication). 
Cash Deposit Requirements 
The following cash deposit 
requirements for estimated antidumping 
duties will be effective for all shipments 
of subject merchandise entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse, for 
consumption on, or after, the date of 
publication of this notice in the Federal 
Register, as provided for by section 751(a)(2)(C) of the Act: (1) for 
merchandise exported by NSC, the cash 
deposit rate will be equal to the 
weighted-average dumping margin 
listed in the table above; (2) the cash 
deposit rate for an exporter not covered 
by this administrative review, but 
covered in a prior completed segment of 
this proceeding, will continue to be the 
exporter’s existing company-specific 
cash deposit rate; (3) if the exporter is 
not covered by this administrative 
review, or a completed segment of this 
proceeding, but the producer of the 
subject merchandise is covered, the cash 
deposit rate will be the producers’ 
existing company-specific cash deposit 
rate; and (4) the cash deposit rate for all 
other producers and exporters will 
continue to be 135.59 percent, the all- 
others cash deposit rate established in 
the Final Determination of the less-than- fair-value investigation in this 
proceeding.
6
 
These cash deposit requirements, 
when imposed, shall remain in effect 
until further notice. 
Notification to Importers 
This notice serves as a final reminder 
to importers of their responsibility 
under 19 CFR 351.402(f)(2) to file a 
certificate regarding the reimbursement 
of antidumping duties prior to 
liquidation of the relevant entries 
during this period of review. Failure to 
comply with this requirement could 
result in Commerce’s presumption that 
reimbursement of antidumping duties 
occurred and the subsequent assessment 
of double antidumping duties.

AGENCY: Enforcement and Compliance, International Trade Administration, 
Department of Commerce. 
SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) preliminarily 
determines that steel concrete 
reinforcing bar (rebar) from Algeria is 
being, or is likely to be, sold in the 
United States at less than fair value 
(LTFV). The period of investigation 
(POI) is April 1, 2024, through March 
31, 2025. Interested parties are invited 
to comment on this preliminary 
determination.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
This preliminary determination is 
made in accordance with section 733(b) 
of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended 
(the Act). Commerce published the 
notice of initiation of this investigation 
on June 30, 2025.
1
Due to the lapse in 
appropriations and Federal Government 
shutdown, on November 14, 2025, 
Commerce tolled all deadlines in 
administrative proceedings by 47 days.
2
 
Additionally, due to a backlog of 
documents that were electronically filed 
via Enforcement and Compliance’s 
Antidumping and Countervailing Duty 
Centralized Electronic Service System 
(ACCESS) during the Federal 
Government shutdown, on November 
24, 2025, Commerce tolled all deadlines 
in administrative proceedings by an 
additional 21 days.
3
Accordingly, the 
deadline for this preliminary 
determination is now January 20, 2026. 
For a complete description of the 
events that followed the initiation of 
this investigation, see the Preliminary Decision Memorandum.
4
A list of topics 
included in the Preliminary Decision 
Memorandum is included as Appendix 
II to this notice. The Preliminary 
Decision Memorandum is a public 
document and is on file electronically 
via Enforcement and Compliance’s 
Antidumping and Countervailing Duty 
Centralized Electronic Service System 
(ACCESS). ACCESS is available to 
registered users at https://access.
trade.gov. In addition, a complete version of the Preliminary Decision 
Memorandum can be accessed directly 
at https://access.trade.gov/public/FRNoticesListLayout.aspx. 
Scope of the Investigation 
The product covered by this 
investigation is rebar from Algeria. For 
a complete description of the scope of 
this investigation, see Appendix I. Scope Comments 
In accordance with the preamble to 
Commerce’s regulations,
5
the Initiation Notice set aside a period of time for parties to raise issues regarding product 
coverage (i.e., scope).6
No interested 
party commented on the scope of the 
investigation as it appeared in the 
Initiation Notice. Commerce is not 
preliminarily modifying the scope 
language as it appeared in the Initiation 
Notice. The complete description of the scope is provided in Appendix I to this 
notice. 
Methodology 
Commerce is conducting this 
investigation in accordance with section 
731 of the Act. Pursuant to section 
776(a) and (b) of the Act, Commerce has 
preliminarily relied upon facts 
otherwise available to determine an 
estimated weighted-average dumping 
margin for Tosyali Iron Steel Industry 
Algeria SPA (Tosyali Algeria), the sole 
mandatory respondent in this 
investigation, because Tosyali Algeria 
withdrew its participation in this 
investigation. 
Furthermore, Commerce preliminarily 
determines that Tosyali Algeria failed to 
cooperate by not acting to the best of its 
ability to comply with a request for 
information and Commerce is using an 
adverse inference in selecting from facts 
otherwise available (i.e., applying adverse facts available (AFA) to this 
respondent, in accordance with section 
776(b) of the Act). For a full description 
of the methodology underlying the 
preliminary determination, see the Preliminary Decision Memorandum. 
All-Others Rate 
Sections 733(d)(1)(ii) and 735(c)(5)(A) 
of the Act provide that, in a preliminary 
determination, Commerce shall 
determine an estimated weighted- 
average dumping margin for all-others 
exporters and producers not 
individually examined. This rate shall 
be an amount equal to the weighted 
average of the estimated weighted- 
average dumping margins established 
for exporters and producers 
individually investigated, excluding any

zero and de minimis margins, and any 
margins determined entirely under 
section 776 of the Act. 
Pursuant to section 735(c)(5)(B) of the 
Act, if the estimated weighted-average 
dumping margins established for all 
exporters and producers individually 
examined are zero, de minimis or 
determined based entirely on facts 
otherwise available, then Commerce 
may use any reasonable method to 
establish the estimated weighted- 
average dumping margin for all other 
producers or exporters. Commerce has 
preliminarily determined that the 
estimated weighted-average dumping 
margin for Tosyali Algeria entirely 
under section 776 of the Act. 
Consequently, pursuant to section 
735(c)(5)(B) of the Act, Commerce’s 
normal practice under these 
circumstances has been to calculate the 
all-others rate as a simple average of the 
dumping margin(s) alleged in the 
petition.
7
 
In the Petition,
8
the petitioner, Rebar 
Trade Action Coalition, alleged a single 
dumping margin for Algeria of 127.32 
percent.
9
Therefore, consistent with our 
practice, for the all-others rate in this 
investigation, we preliminarily assign 
the dumping margin alleged in the 
Petition, which is 127.32 percent. 
Preliminary Determination 
Commerce preliminarily determines 
that the following estimated weighted- 
average dumping margins exist: 
Exporter or producer 
Weighted- 
average 
dumping 
margin 
(percent) 
Tosyali Iron Steel Industry Alge-
ria SPA .................................... * 127.32 
All Others .................................... 127.32 
* Rate is based on facts available with ad-
verse inferences. 
Suspension of Liquidation 
In accordance with section 733(d)(2) 
of the Act, Commerce will direct U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to 
suspend liquidation of entries of subject 
merchandise, as described in Appendix 
I, entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption on or after 
the date of publication of this notice in 
the Federal Register. Further, pursuant to section 733(d)(1)(B) of the Act and 19 
CFR 351.205(d), Commerce will instruct 
CBP to require a cash deposit equal to 
the estimated weighted-average 
dumping margin, as follows: (1) the cash 
deposit rate for merchandise exported 
by Tosyali Algeria will be equal to the 
company-specific estimated weighted- 
average dumping margins determined in 
this preliminary determination; (2) if the 
exporter is not a respondent identified 
above, but the producer is, then the cash 
deposit rate will be equal to the 
company-specific estimated weighted- 
average dumping margin established for 
that producer of the subject 
merchandise; and (3) the cash deposit 
rate for all other producers and 
exporters will be equal to the all-others 
estimated weighted-average dumping 
margin. 
These suspension of liquidation 
instructions will remain in effect until 
further notice. 
Disclosure 
Normally, Commerce discloses to 
interested parties the calculations 
performed in connection with a 
preliminary determination within five 
days of any public announcement or, if 
there is no public announcement, 
within five days of the date of 
publication of the notice of preliminary 
determination in the Federal Register, 
in accordance with 19 CFR 351.224(b). 
However, because Commerce 
preliminarily applied AFA to determine 
the estimated weighted-average 
dumping margin for the individually 
examined company, Tosyali Algeria, in 
this investigation, in accordance with 
section 776 of the Act, and the applied 
AFA rate is based solely on the petition, 
there are no calculations to disclose. 
Consistent with 19 CFR 351.224(e), 
Commerce will analyze and, if 
appropriate, correct any timely 
allegations of significant ministerial 
errors by amending the preliminary 
determination. However, consistent 
with 19 CFR 351.224(d), Commerce will 
not consider incomplete allegations that 
do not address the significance standard 
under 19 CFR 351.224(g) following the 
preliminary determination. Instead, 
Commerce will address such allegations 
in the final determination together with 
issues raised in the case briefs or other 
written comments. 
Verification 
Because Tosyali Algeria in this 
investigation did not provide the 
information requested by Commerce, 
and Commerce preliminarily determines 
Tosyali Algeria to have been 
uncooperative, Commerce will not 
conduct verification. 
Public Comment 
Case briefs or other written comments 
may be submitted to the Assistant 
Secretary for Enforcement and 
Compliance no later than 30 days after 
the date of publication of the 
preliminary determination, unless the 
Secretary alters the time limit. Rebuttal 
briefs, limited to issues raised in the 
case briefs, may be filed not later than 
five days after the date for filing case 
briefs.
10
Interested parties who submit 
case briefs or rebuttal briefs in this 
proceeding must submit: (1) a table of 
contents listing each issue; and (2) a 
table of authorities.
11
 
As provided under 19 CFR 
351.309(c)(2)(iii) and (d)(2)(iii), we 
request that interested parties provide at 
the beginning of their briefs a public, 
executive summary for each issue raised 
in their briefs.
12
Further, we request that 
interested parties limit their executive 
summary of each issue to no more than 
450 words, not including citations. We 
intend to use the executive summaries 
as the basis of the comment summaries 
included in the issues and decision 
memorandum that will accompany the 
final determination in this investigation. 
We request that interested parties 
include footnotes for relevant citations 
in the executive summary of each issue. 
Note that Commerce has amended 
certain of its requirements pertaining to 
the service of documents in 19 CFR 
351.303(f).

the 2022–2023 Administrative Review 
AGENCY: Enforcement and Compliance, International Trade Administration, 
Department of Commerce. 
SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that 
the Agreement Suspending the 
Antidumping Duty Investigation on 
Sugar from Mexico, as amended (AD 
Agreement) met the statutory 
requirements during the period of 
review (POR) from December 1, 2022, 
through November 30, 2023. Commerce 
also determines that the respondents 
selected for individual examination, 
Azucarera San Jose De Abajo S.A. (San 
Jose) and Santa Rosalia de la Chontalpa, 
S.A. de C.V., and its affiliates (Santa 
Rosalia; collectively, Grupo BSM), were 
generally in compliance with the terms 
of the AD Agreement during the POR. 
However, we determine that Grupo BSM 
did not comply with the requirement to 
eliminate at least 85 percent of the 
dumping found in the investigation 
during the POR. Furthermore, we 
consider the respondents’ noncompliant 
behavior to be serious and in need of 
remediation, and we will implement 
certain steps to address the 
noncompliance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On April 7, 2025, Commerce 
published the Preliminary Results of 
this administrative review.
1
 
Pursuant to section 782(i) of the Tariff 
Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and 
19 CFR 351.307(b), we conducted

Due to the lapse in appropriations and 
Federal Government shutdown, on 
November 14, 2025, Commerce tolled 
all deadlines in administrative 
proceedings by 47 days.

Accordingly, the 
deadline for these final results is now 
December 15, 2025. 
Scope of the AD Agreement 
The product covered by this AD 
Agreement is raw and refined sugar of 
all polarimeter readings derived from 
sugar cane or sugar beets. Merchandise 
covered by this AD Agreement is 
typically imported under the following 
headings of the HTSUS: 1701.12.1000, 
1701.12.5000, 1701.13.1000,

customs purposes; however, the written 
description of the scope of this AD 
Agreement is dispositive. 
A full description of the scope of the 
AD Agreement is contained in the Issues 
and Decision Memorandum.

Analysis 
Commerce continues to determine 
that, based on record evidence, the 
respondents were generally in 
compliance with the AD Agreement and 
that the AD Agreement met the statutory 
requirements under sections 734(c) and 
(d) of the Act during the POR. However, 
we continue to determine that Grupo 
BSM did not comply with the 
requirement to eliminate at least 85 
percent of the dumping found in the 
investigation for both Refined and Other 
Sugar sales during the POR. 
Furthermore, we continue to consider 
Grupo BSM’s noncompliant behavior to 
be serious and in need of remediation 
for its Other Sugar sales. 
We intend to address what we have 
found to be serious noncompliance by 
Grupo BSM with an ‘‘action plan’’ first 
outlined in the Preliminary Results, 
with the exception of verification of 
Grupo BSM’s questionnaire responses 
which has been completed. Commerce’s 
next steps will include: formal 
consultations with the Signatories to the 
AD Agreement under Section VII.E.2 
(Operations Consultations); additional 
monitoring of Grupo BSM; and 
consideration of the selection of Grupo 
BSM in a future administrative review. 
These measures are necessary to ensure 
compliance with the AD Agreement and 
that any potential administrative 
challenges to effective monitoring are 
diminished. 
The issues raised in the case and 
rebuttal briefs are addressed in the 
accompanying Issues and Decision 
Memorandum and business proprietary 
memorandum.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This SARSRP population estimation study is 
separate from the traditional data 
collection processes used to inform 
stock assessments. This study was 
designed with careful consideration of 
methods to support practical 
application by management. Therefore, 
the data will be considered for 
incorporation into the stock assessment 
following review by the Center for 
Independent Experts (CIE). Next, the 
South Atlantic Fishery Management 
Council (SAFMC)’s Scientific and 
Statistical Committee (SSC) will review 
the data and consider it for 
incorporation in the red snapper stock 
assessment. 
Visit the South Carolina Sea Grant 
Consortium website for more 
information on the project and draft 
report: https://sarsrp.scseagrant.org. Selected reviewers will have expertise 
in the methods used to produce the 
population estimates. Following this 
review, the research team will have time 
to respond and make revisions. The full 
integration into management decisions 
will come later. Early findings should 
not be over-interpreted. 
The Gulf, South Atlantic, and 
Caribbean Fishery Management 
Councils, in conjunction with NMFS 
and the Atlantic and Gulf States Marine 
Fisheries Commissions have 
implemented the SEDAR process, a 
multi-step method for determining the 
status of fish stocks in the Southeast 
Region. SEDAR is a participatory 
process for developing, evaluating and 
reviewing information used for fisheries 
management advice. The process may 
include (1) a Data stage, and (2) an 
Assessment stage, and (3) a Review 
stage. The product of the Review 
Workshop is a Review Summary 
documenting panel opinions regarding 
the strengths and weaknesses of the 
products reviewed. Review materials 
will be posted at https://
sarsrp.scseagrant.org/report/. The items of discussion in the Review 
Workshop are as follows: 
Participants will evaluate the 
technical merits of the SARSRP reports, 
as specified in the Terms of Reference 
for the workshop, and determine if they 
are scientifically sound. 
Although non-emergency issues not 
contained in this agenda may come 
before this group for discussion, those 
issues may not be the subject of formal 
action during this meeting. Action will 
be restricted to those issues specifically 
identified in this notice and any issues 
arising after publication of this notice 
that require emergency action under 
section 305(c) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act, provided the public has been 
notified of the intent to take final action 
to address the emergency. 
The established times may be 
adjusted as necessary to accommodate 
the timely completion of discussion 
relevant to the assessment process. Such 
adjustments may result in the meeting 
being extended from or completed prior 
to the time established by this notice. 
Special Accommodations 
These meetings are physically 
accessible to people with disabilities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
The MMPA prohibits the ‘‘take’’ of 
marine mammals, with certain 
exceptions. Sections 101(a)(5)(A) and 
(D) of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 et 
seq.) direct the Secretary of Commerce 
(as delegated to NMFS) to allow, upon 
request, the incidental, but not 
intentional, taking of small numbers of 
marine mammals by U.S. citizens who 
engage in a specified activity (other than 
commercial fishing) within a specified 
geographical region if certain findings 
are made and either regulations are 
issued or, if the taking is limited to 
harassment, a notice of a proposed 
incidental take authorization may be 
provided to the public for review. 
Authorization for incidental takings 
shall be granted if NMFS finds that the 
taking will have a negligible impact on 
the species or stock(s) and will not have 
an unmitigable adverse impact on the 
availability of the species or stock(s) for 
taking for subsistence uses (where 
relevant). Further, NMFS must prescribe 
the permissible methods of taking and 
other ‘‘means of effecting the least 
practicable adverse impact’’ on the 
affected species or stocks and their 
habitat, paying particular attention to 
rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of 
similar significance, and on the 
availability of such species or stocks for 
taking for certain subsistence uses 
(referred to in shorthand as 
‘‘mitigation’’); and requirements 
pertaining to the mitigation, monitoring 
and reporting of such takings are set 
forth. 
National Environmental Policy Act 
To comply with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(NEPA; 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and 
NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 
216–6A, NMFS must review our 
proposed action (i.e., the issuance of an IHA) with respect to potential impacts 
on the human environment. This action 
is consistent with categories of activities 
identified in Categorical Exclusion B4 
(IHAs with no anticipated serious injury 
or mortality) of the Companion Manual 
for NOAA Administrative Order 216– 
6A, which do not individually or 
cumulatively have the potential for 
significant impacts on the quality of the 
human environment and for which we 
have not identified any extraordinary 
circumstances that would preclude this 
categorical exclusion. Accordingly, 
NMFS has preliminarily determined 
that the issuance of the proposed IHA 
qualifies to be categorically excluded 
from further NEPA review. 
We will review all comments 
submitted in response to this 
notification prior to concluding our 
NEPA process or making a final 
decision on the IHA request. 
History of Request 
On May 6, 2022, NMFS received a 
request from the U.S. Navy on behalf of 
OMAO for an IHA to take marine 
mammals incidental to construction 
activities associated with the relocation 
of NOAA research vessels to the Naval 
Station Newport in Rhode Island. 
OMAO’s request was for authorization 
of take of seven species of marine 
mammals by Level B harassment and, 
for four of these species, Level A 
harassment. NMFS published a notice of 
the proposed IHA in the Federal 
Register on November 2, 2022 (87 FR 66133). NMFS subsequently issued the 
IHA on December 21, 2022 (87 FR 
78072), which was effective from 
February 1, 2024 through January 31, 
2025. 
On November 15, 2024, NMFS 
received an application for the renewal 
of the 2024 IHA. The remaining 
activities of the construction project 
included removal of abandoned guide 
piles along the bulkhead, demolition of 
the current floating dock, installation of 
gangway support piles and fender piles, 
installation and removal of piles for a 
construction template, and construction 
of a small boat floating dock. Therefore, 
NMFS issued a renewal (90 FR 11400, 
March 6, 2025) (herein referred to as the 
2025 renewal IHA) to OMAO 
authorizing take incidental to the 
remaining work that could not be 
accomplished during the timeframe of 
the 2024 IHA. This renewal will expire 
on January 31, 2026. 
On August 27, 2025, the Navy on 
behalf of OMAO submitted an 
application for the remaining work that 
was not accomplished under the 2024 
IHA and the 2025 renewal IHA. The 
application was deemed adequate and 
complete on December 5, 2025 (the 2025 
Request). OMAO’s request is for take of 
the same seven species of marine 
mammals, comprising three cetacean 
and four pinniped stocks, by Level B 
harassment only. Neither OMAO nor 
NMFS, expect serious injury or 
mortality to result from this activity, 
and therefore, an IHA is appropriate. 
Take by Level A harassment (injury) is 
considered unlikely, even absent 
mitigation, based on the small sizes of 
the associated harassment zones. The 
2024 IHA and the 2025 renewal IHA 
included take by Level A harassment 
because during that phase of 
construction the use of impact and a 
down the hole (DTH) mono-hammer 
was used and resulted in larger Level A 
harassment zones increasing the 
likelihood of that level of take. 
This request is very similar to the 
2024 IHA and NMFS relies substantially 
herein, as appropriate, on the 
information previously presented in the 
notices associated with the issuance of 
the 2024 IHA (87 FR 78072, December 
21, 2022). This proposed IHA would 
authorize take for a subset of the 
activities originally planned during the 
2024 IHA and the 2025 renewal IHA. 
However, some changes have occurred 
during this year’s evaluation of the 
project. Source levels and harassment

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159509 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Notices zone distances have been adjusted based 
on updated source level information 
and amount of time pile driving is 
expected to occur each day. Marine 
mammal densities have also been 
updated based on new information. The 
proposed mitigation, monitoring, and 
reporting measures remain the same as 
prescribed in the 2024 IHA with slight 
modifications (e.g., shutdown zones distance changes) (see Proposed 
Mitigation and Proposed Monitoring 
and Reporting). The proposed IHA 
would be valid for the statutory 
maximum of 1 year from the date of 
effectiveness, and will become effective 
upon written notification from the 
applicant to NMFS, but not beginning 
later than 1 year from the date of 
issuance or extending beyond 2 years 
from the date of issuance. 
Description of the Proposed Activity 
and Anticipated Impacts 
The proposed activity would establish 
adequate pier, shoreside, and support 
facilities to support the relocation of 
four NOAA Atlantic Fleet research 
vessels at NAVSTA Newport, RI. This 
includes the construction of a new pier, 
trestle, small boat floating dock, 
bulkhead, and shore side facilities in 
Coddington Cove. The 2024 IHA and the 
2025 renewal IHA covered the 
installation and removal of 1,103 piles 
of various sizes over an estimated 343 
days of pile driving with impact and 
vibratory hammers (87 FR 78072, 
December 21, 2022). OMAO did not 
complete all the initially planned work, 
and now requests this proposed IHA to 
authorize take incidental to the 
installation of the remaining 201 16-in 
(inch) steel fender piles. 
The 2024 IHA and the 2025 renewal 
IHA authorized Level A and B 
harassment of four species of marine 
mammals and Level B harassment of 
three species of marine mammals. 
OMAO is only requesting authorization 
to harass these same species by Level B 
harassment only. Take by Level A 
harassment is unlikely given the small 
sizes of the harassment zones and 
expected shutdown procedure (see 
Proposed Mitigation) would likely 
prevent auditory injury of all marine 
mammal species that are proposed for 
take under this IHA. 
To support public review and 
comment on the IHA that NMFS is 
proposing to issue here, we refer to the 
documents related to the previously 
issued IHA and discuss any new or 
changed information here. The previous 
documents include the Federal Register 
notice of the proposed IHA (87 FR 
66133, November 2, 2022), Federal 
Register notice of issuance of the 2024 IHA (87 FR 78072, December 21, 2022), 
and all associated references and 
documents. NMFS also refers the reader 
to OMAO’s previous and current 
applications and monitoring reports 
which can be found at https://
www.fisheries.noaa.gov/action/ 
incidental-take-authorization-noaa- 
office-marine-and-aviation-operations- 
research-vessel. 
Detailed Description of the Action 
A detailed description of the 
proposed construction activities is 
found in these aforementioned Federal 
Register notices and documents associated with the previous IHAs. 
Work completed under the 2024 IHA 
and 2025 renewal included the use of 
vibratory, impact, rotary drill, and a 
DTH mono-hammer to install and 
remove piles at NAVSTA Newport. 
During the work completed thought the 
authorized period of these IHAs 782 
piles were either installed or removed 
out of the 983 originally planned. 
The location, timing, and nature of 
the activities, including the types of 
equipment planned for use (vibratory 
hammers), are identical to those 
described in the previous notices. Of the 
983 piles 201 fender piles were unable 
to be installed during the period of 
authorization under the 2024 IHA and 
the 2025 renewal. Take incidental to 
this work would be authorized under 
this proposed IHA. In the 2024 IHA it 
was expected to require 50 days to 
install the fender piles but the Navy and 
OMAO have revised that estimate to 130 
days in this new application. This 
revision was determined by the Navy 
and OMAO based on updated daily 
production estimates of vibratory pile 
installation. 
Description of Marine Mammals 
A description of the marine mammals 
in the area of the activities is found in 
the previous documents for the 2024 
IHA (87 FR 66133, November 2, 2022; 
87 FR 78072, December 21, 2022), 
which remains applicable to this 
proposed IHA. In addition, NMFS 
reviewed the most recent draft Stock 
Assessment Reports (SARs, found on 
NMFS’ website at https://
www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/ 
marine-mammal-protection/marine- 
mammal-stock-assessments), up-to-date 
information on relevant Unusual 
Mortality Events (UMEs; https://
www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/ 
marine-mammal-protection/marine- 
mammal-unusual-mortality-events), and 
recent scientific literature and 
determined that no new information 
affects our original analysis of impacts 
under the 2024 IHA. 
NMFS notes that, since the issuance 
of the 2024 IHA, new SARs are available 
for common dolphin (Delphinus 
delphis), harbor porpoise (Phocoena 
phocoena), and gray seals (Halichoerus 
grypus). The best estimate of abundance 
for each of these species has declined 
since the issuance of the 2024 IHA. The 
common dolphin abundance estimate 
decreased from 172,974 to 93,100 
individuals, the harbor porpoise 
abundance estimate decreased from 
95,543 to 85,765 individuals, and the 
estimate for the portion of gray seals 
present in U.S. waters decreased from 
27,911 to 27,300 individuals. None of 
these abundance estimate decreases 
change the findings NMFS made in the 
2024 IHA. 
Potential Effects on Marine Mammals 
and Their Habitat 
A description of the potential effects 
of the specified activities on marine 
mammals and their habitat may be 
found in the documents supporting the 
2024 IHA (87 FR 66133, November 2, 
2022; 87 FR 78072, December 21, 2022), 
which remains applicable to the 
issuance of this proposed IHA. At 
present, there is no new information on 
potential effects that would impact our 
analysis. 
Estimated Take 
A detailed description of the methods 
used to estimate take anticipated to 
occur incidental to the proposed project 
can be found in the previous Federal 
Register notices for the 2024 IHA (87 FR 66133, November 2, 2022; 87 FR 78072, 
December 21, 2022) and the Federal 
Register notices for the renewal (90 FR 8009, January 23, 2025; 90 FR 11400, 
March 6, 2025) including incorporation 
of the updated 2024 Technical Guidance 
(89 FR 84872, October 24, 2024). 
NMFS also updated the source level 
that was used for the vibratory 
installation of 16-in steel pipe piles in 
the previous Federal Register notices 
for the 2024 IHA (87 FR 66133, 
November 2, 2022; 87 FR 78072, 
December 21, 2022) from 162 Root Mean 
Square (RMS) decibel (dB) re 1 micro 
pascal (mPa) to 163 RMS (dB re 1 mPa). 
This update to the source level has 
changed the estimated Level A and 
Level B harassment zones that were 
previously estimated for the 2024 IHA 
and renewal of that IHA. The estimated 
radial distance to the Level B 
harassment threshold for all marine 
mammals is 7,356 meters (m) (2024 IHA 
estimated distance was 6,310 m). When 
calculating the maximum ensonified 
area the distance is truncated by 
shoreline in all directions, so sound will 
not reach the full distance of the

Therefore, the maximum ensonified area 
for this project is 8.52 kilometers (km

The 2024 IHA estimated the same 
ensonified area for the 16-in steel fender 
piles. Table 1 outlines the updated zone 
sizes and the corresponding area of the

is available in the 2024 IHA Federal 
Register notices (87 FR 66133, November 2, 2022; 87 FR 78072, 
December 21, 2022) and section 3 of the 
Navy and OMAO’s application. These 
densities have been updated since the 
issuance of the 2024 IHA and are 
available in table 2 for each species.

as the 2024 IHA Federal Register 
notices (87 FR 66133, November 2, 
2022; 87 FR 78072, December 21, 2022). 
However, given the low number of 
expected takes of Atlantic white-sided 
dolphin and common dolphins NMFS 
used data from Oliveira et al. (2024) to 
estimate the average group size of these 
species at 16 and 30 individuals 
respectively. This group size was used 
as a proxy for the take estimate since the 
calculated take was lower than the 
average group size. The proposed take to 
be authorized for this project can be 
found in table 3.

The proposed mitigation measures are 
nearly identical to those included in the 
FR Notice announcing the final 2024 
IHA (87 FR 66133, November 2, 2022; 
87 FR 78072, December 21, 2022) and 
the discussion of the least practicable 
adverse impact included in that 
document remains accurate. The 
shutdown zone sizes have been updated 
by the Navy. The shutdown zone sizes 
used in the 2024 IHA for this activity 
were 20 m for cetaceans and 10 m for 
pinnipeds. The following measures are 
proposed for inclusion in this IHA: 
Implementation of a Shutdown Zone 
For all of the proposed pile driving 
activities, OMAO would implement 
shutdowns of pile driving activity 
within the established zone. 
Implementation of shutdowns will be 
used to avoid incidental Level A 
harassment takes from the proposed 
vibratory pile driving. The established 
shutdown zone would be 35 m for all 
marine mammal hearing groups during 
the installation of the 16-in steel fender 
piles. The placement of protected 
species observers (PSOs) during all pile 
driving activities (see Proposed 
Monitoring and Reporting section) 
would ensure the full extent of 
shutdown zones are visible to PSOs. If 
a marine mammal is observed within 
the shutdown zone, construction 
activity would be delayed until the 
animal has voluntarily exited and been 
visually confirmed beyond the 
shutdown zone or has not been 
observed for 15 minutes. 
Establishment of a Monitoring Zone 
A monitoring zone provides utility for 
observing by establishing monitoring 
protocols for areas adjacent to the 
shutdown zones. The monitoring zone 
enables PSOs to be aware of and 
communicate the presence of marine 
mammals in the project area outside the

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159511 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Notices shutdown zone and thus prepare for a 
potential cessation of activity should the 
animal enter the shutdown zone. PSOs 
would monitor the monitoring zone to 
the extent practicable to maintain the 
best sense of where animals are moving 
relative to a zone boundary. The 
monitoring zone is equivalent to the 
Level B harassment zone distance which 
is 7,356 m. When a marine mammal for 
which Level B harassment take is 
authorized is present in the Level B 
harassment zone, activities would 
continue. 
Proposed Monitoring and Reporting 
Visual Monitoring 
A minimum of two NMFS-approved 
PSOs must be stationed at strategic 
vantage points for the entirety of active 
construction operations. PSOs would be 
independent of the activity contractor 
(for example, employed by a 
subcontractor) and have no other 
assigned tasks during monitoring 
periods. At least one PSO would have 
prior experience performing the duties 
of a PSO during an activity pursuant to 
a NMFS-issued Incidental Take 
Authorization (ITA) or Letter of 
Concurrence (LOC). Other PSOs may 
substitute other relevant experience, 
education (degree in biological science 
or related field), or training for prior 
experience performing the duties of a 
PSO during construction activity 
pursuant to a NMFS-issued ITA/LOC. 
Pre- and Post-Activity Monitoring 
Monitoring would take place from 30 
minutes prior to initiation of pile 
driving activity (i.e., pre-start clearance monitoring) through 30 minutes post- 
completion of pile driving activity. In 
addition, monitoring for 30 minutes 
would take place whenever a break in 
the specified activity (i.e., vibratory pile driving) of 30 minutes or longer occurs. 
Pre-start clearance monitoring would be 
conducted during periods of visibility 
sufficient for the lead PSO to determine 
that the shutdown zones (i.e. 35 m) are clear of marine mammals. Pile driving 
may commence following 30 minutes of 
observation when the determination is 
made that the shutdown zones are clear 
of marine mammals. 
PSO Requirements 
PSOs would be independent (i.e., 
employees of the entity conducting 
construction activities may not serve as 
PSOs) who have no other assigned tasks 
during monitoring periods. At least one 
PSO would have prior experience 
performing the duties of a PSO during 
an activity pursuant to a NMFS-issued 
ITA/LOC. Other PSOs may substitute 
other relevant experience, education 
(degree in biological science or related 
field), or training for prior experience 
performing the duties of a PSO during 
construction activity pursuant to a 
NMFS-issued incidental take 
authorization. Other PSOs may 
substitute education (degree in 
biological science or related field) or 
training for experience. 
Reporting 
OMAO would submit a draft marine 
mammal monitoring report to NMFS 
within 90 days after the completion of 
pile driving activities, or 60 days prior 
to a requested date of issuance of any 
future IHAs for the project, or other 
projects at the same location, whichever 
comes first. The marine mammal 
monitoring report would include an 
overall description of work completed, 
a narrative regarding marine mammal 
sightings, and associated PSO data 
sheets. The details of what would be 
included in the report are available in 
the 2024 IHA Federal Register notices 
(87 FR 66133, November 2, 2022; 87 FR 
78072, December 21, 2022). 
Preliminary Determinations 
When issuing the 2024 IHA (87 FR 
78072, December 21, 2022), NMFS 
found OMAO’s proposed construction 
project would have a negligible impact 
on species or stocks annual rates of 
recruitment and survival and the 
amount of taking would be small 
relative to the population size of such 
species or stocks (less than 4 percent). 
OMAO’s proposed construction 
activities are nearly identical to those 
analyzed in support of the 2024 IHA. 
Additionally, the potential effects of the 
activity, taking into consideration the 
proposed mitigation and related 
monitoring measures, are identical to 
those evaluated in support of the 2024 
IHA. The estimated take proposed to be 
authorized for this subset of activity is 
less than what was authorized in the 
2024 IHA (see table 3). The total amount 
of takes proposed for authorization are 
small relative to the best available 
population size of each species or stock 
(less than five percent for all stocks). 
Additionally, only Level B harassment 
is proposed for authorization, which 
NMFS expects would be of a lower 
severity, predominately in the form of 
avoidance of the sound sources that may 
cause a temporary abandonment of the 
location during active source use that 
may result in a temporary interruption 
of foraging activities for some species. 
NMFS does not expect that the 
proposed activity will have long-term or 
permanent impacts as the acoustic 
source would be relatively brief 
amounts of time in relatively confined 
footprints and therefore, no impacts on 
the annual rates of recruitment or 
survival are expected to result. 
As previously discussed in the 2024 
IHA (87 FR 78072, December 21, 2022), 
impacts from the construction activity 
are expected to be localized to the 
specific area of activity. The specified 
activity and associated ensonified areas 
do not include habitat areas known to 
be of special significance (Biologically 
Import Areas or Endangered Species Act 
(ESA)-designated critical habitat) of any 
marine mammals species. There are 
over 22 documented haul-out sites 
throughout Narragansett Bay mainly 
occupied by harbor seals (The 
Jamestown Press 2025). The Three 
Sisters seal haulout is the closest to the 
project area, just over 1 mile (1.6 km) 
south of the pier on the open water edge 
of Coddington Cove. As hauled out seals 
would be out of the water, no in-water 
effects are expected nor are any in-air 
effects expected given the distance of 
the haulout location from the project 
area. In conclusion, there is no new 
information suggesting that our analysis 
or findings should change. 
Based on the information contained 
here and in the referenced documents, 
NMFS has preliminarily determined the 
following: (1) the required mitigation 
measures will effect the least practicable 
impact on marine mammal species or 
stocks and their habitat; (2) the 
proposed authorized takes will have a 
negligible impact on the affected marine 
mammal species or stocks; (3) the 
proposed authorized takes represent 
small numbers of marine mammals 
relative to the affected stock 
abundances; (4) OMAO’s activities will 
not have an unmitigable adverse impact 
on taking for subsistence purposes as no 
relevant subsistence uses of marine 
mammals are implicated by this action, 
and (5) appropriate monitoring and 
reporting requirements are included. 
Endangered Species Act (ESA) 
Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA of 1973 (16 
U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) requires that each 
Federal agency ensures that any action 
it authorizes, funds, or carries out is not 
likely to jeopardize the continued 
existence of any endangered or 
threatened species or result in the 
destruction or adverse modification of 
designated critical habitat. To ensure 
ESA compliance for the issuance of 
IHAs, NMFS consults internally 
whenever we propose to authorize take 
for endangered or threatened species. 
No incidental take of ESA-listed 
species is proposed for authorization or 
expected to result from this activity. 
Therefore, NMFS has determined that

the ESA is not required for this action. 
Proposed Authorization 
As a result of these preliminary 
determinations, NMFS proposes to issue 
an IHA to OMAO for conducting 
construction activities, in Newport, RI, 
provided the previously mentioned 
mitigation, monitoring, and reporting 
requirements are incorporated. A draft

following notice to the public providing 
an additional 15 days for public 
comments when (1) up to another year 
of identical or nearly identical, or nearly 
identical, activities as described in the 
Description of the Proposed Activity 
and Anticipated Impacts section of this 
notice is planned or (2) the activities as 
described in the Description of the 
Proposed Activity and Anticipated 
Impacts section of this notice would not 
be completed by the time the IHA 
expires and a renewal would allow for 
completion of the activities beyond that 
described in the History of Request 
section of this notice, provided all of the 
following conditions are met: 
€A request for renewal is received no later than 60 days prior to the needed 
renewal IHA effective date (recognizing 
that the renewal IHA expiration date 
cannot extend beyond one year from 
expiration of the initial IHA). 
€The request for renewal must include the following: 
(1) An explanation that the activities 
to be conducted under the requested 
renewal IHA are identical to the 
activities analyzed under the initial 
IHA, are a subset of the activities, or 
include changes so minor (e.g., 
reduction in pile size) that the changes 
do not affect the previous analyses, 
mitigation and monitoring 
requirements, or take estimates (with 
the exception of reducing the type or 
amount of take). 
(2) A preliminary monitoring report 
showing the results of the required 
monitoring to date and an explanation 
showing that the monitoring results do 
not indicate impacts of a scale or nature 
not previously analyzed or authorized. 
€Upon review of the request for renewal, the status of the affected 
species or stocks, and any other 
pertinent information, NMFS 
determines that there are no more than 
minor changes in the activities, the 
mitigation and monitoring measures 
will remain the same and appropriate, 
and the findings in the initial IHA 
remain valid.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Abstract 
This request is for revision and 
extension of a currently approved 
information collection. Under the 
provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act; 16 U.S.C. 
1801 et seq.), NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is responsible 
for management of the nation’s marine 
fisheries. Atlantic highly migratory 
species (HMS) fisheries (swordfish, 
sharks, tunas, and billfish) are managed 
under the 2006 Consolidated HMS 
Fishery Management Plan and its 
amendments pursuant to the authority 
of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and 
consistent with the Atlantic Tunas 
Convention Act (ATCA; 16 U.S.C. 971 et 
seq.). Existing regulations at 50 CFR part 
635 require operators of tournaments 
involving HMS to register four weeks in 
advance of the tournament. Operators 
must provide contact information and 
the tournament’s date(s), location(s), 
and target species. Operators are 
required to submit an HMS tournament 
summary report within seven days after 
tournament fishing has ended. Most of 
the catch data in the summary report is 
routinely collected in the course of 
regular tournament operations. NMFS 
uses the data to estimate the total 
annual catch of HMS and the impact of 
tournament operations in relation to 
other types of fishing activities. In 
addition, HMS tournament registration 
provides a method for tournament 
operators to request educational and 
regulatory outreach materials from 
NMFS. NMFS is considering 
modifications to the tournament 
registration and reporting forms, 
including, but not limited to: (1) 
updating the target species list in the 
tournament registration form, (2) 
reporting of Bluefin tuna catch by size 
class, (3) clarification regarding for 
which species tournament operators are 
required to report individual lengths 
and weights in their post-tournament 
catch reports, and (4) the addition of 
questions regarding the depredation of

for FERC Form No. 60. Because of this, Arelle, Xule, 
and XENDR dependency updates in the FERC Form 
No. 60 Taxonomy Package were delayed until this 
2026–01–01 draft taxonomy package. All other 
taxonomies adopted these updates with Version 
2025–04–01. 
information is necessary for the 
Secretary to evaluate compliance with 
each of the criteria and to monitor the 
continued compliance with the criteria 
during any period of recognition 
granted. The authority for collecting this 
information is contained in the Higher 
Education Act of 1965, as amended 
§ 496 (HEA), and implementing 
regulations at 34 CFR 602. The data is 
required in order for recognized 
accrediting agencies to demonstrate 
compliance with 34 CFR 602. The 
Secretary will use these criteria in 
determining whether an accrediting 
agency is a reliable authority as to the 
quality of education or training 
provided by institutions of higher 
education they accredit. The data is 
required by State Agencies for the 
approval of Vocational Education to 
demonstrate compliance with 34 CFR 
603. The Secretary will use these 
criterial to determine whether a State 
Agency for the Approval of Vocational 
Education is a reliable authority as to 
the quality of education or training 
provided by the vocational institutions 
of higher education they accredit. The 
data is also required in order for State 
approval Agencies for Nurse Education 
to demonstrate compliance with the 
criteria and procedures for recognition 
of State Agencies for Approval of Nurse 
Education. The Secretary will use these 
criteria in determining whether a State 
agency is a reliable authority as to the 
quality of training offered by schools of 
nursing.

Records Governing Off-the-Record 
Communications; Public Notice 
This constitutes notice, in accordance 
with 18 CFR 385.2201(b), of the receipt 
of prohibited and exempt off-the-record 
communications. 
Order No. 607 (64 FR 51222, 
September 22, 1999) requires 
Commission decisional employees, who 
make or receive a prohibited or exempt 
off-the-record communication relevant 
to the merits of a contested proceeding, 
to deliver to the Secretary of the 
Commission, a copy of the 
communication, if written, or a 
summary of the substance of any oral 
communication. 
Prohibited communications are 
included in a public, non-decisional file 
associated with, but not a part of, the 
decisional record of the proceeding. 
Unless the Commission determines that 
the prohibited communication and any 
responses thereto should become a part 
of the decisional record, the prohibited 
off-the-record communication will not 
be considered by the Commission in 
reaching its decision. Parties to a 
proceeding may seek the opportunity to 
respond to any facts or contentions 
made in a prohibited off-the-record 
communication and may request that 
the Commission place the prohibited 
communication and responses thereto 
in the decisional record. The 
Commission will grant such a request 
only when it determines that fairness so 
requires. Any person identified below as 
having made a prohibited off-the-record 
communication shall serve the 
document on all parties listed on the 
official service list for the applicable 
proceeding in accordance with Rule 
2010, 18 CFR 385.2010. 
Exempt off-the-record 
communications are included in the 
decisional record of the proceeding, 
unless the communication was with a 
cooperating agency as described by 40 
CFR 1501.6, made under 18 CFR 
385.2201(e)(1)(v).

Cancellation Order for Certain 
Pesticide Registrations and/or 
Amendments To Terminate Uses (From 
August 05, 2025, Notice) 
AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces EPA’s order for the cancellations and/or 
amendments to terminate uses, 
voluntarily requested by the registrants 
and accepted by the Agency, pursuant 
to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, 
and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). This 
cancellation order follows an August 05, 
2025, Federal Register Notice of Receipt of Requests from the registrants listed in 
Table 3 of Unit II, to voluntarily cancel 
and/or amend to terminate uses of these 
product registrations. In the August 05, 
2025, notice, EPA indicated that it 
would issue an order implementing the 
cancellations and/or amendments to 
terminate uses, unless the Agency 
received substantive comments within 
the 30-day comment period that would 
merit its further review of these 
requests, or unless the registrants 
withdrew their requests. The Agency 
did not receive any comments on the 
notice. One registrant, the registrant of 
7969–33, withdrew their request. 
Therefore, it has been removed from this 
notice. Accordingly, EPA hereby issues 
this notice a cancellation order granting 
the requested cancellations and/or 
amendments to terminate uses. Any 
distribution, sale, or use of the products 
subject to this cancellation order is 
permitted only in accordance with the 
terms of this order, including any 
existing stocks provisions. 
DATES: The cancellations and/or amendments are effective December 19, 
2025.

Received and Agency Response to 
Comments 
During the public comment period 
provided, EPA received no comments in 
response to the August 05, 2025, 
Federal Register (90 FR 37504) (FRL– 
12719–01–OCSPP) notice announcing 
the Agency’s receipt of the requests for 
voluntary cancellations and/or 
amendments to terminate uses of 
products listed in Tables 1, 1A and 2 of 
Unit II. 
IV. Cancellation Order 
Pursuant to FIFRA section 6(f) (7 
U.S.C. 136d(f)(1)), EPA hereby approves 
the requested cancellations and/or 
amendments to terminate uses of 
registrations identified in Tables 1, 1A 
and 2 of Unit II. Accordingly, the 
Agency hereby orders that the product 
registrations identified in Tables 1, 1A 
and 2 of Unit II, are canceled and/or 
amended to terminate the affected uses. 
The effective date of the cancellations 
that are subject of this notice is 
December 19, 2025. Any distribution, 
sale, or use of existing stocks of the 
products identified in Tables 1, 1A and 
2 of Unit II, in a manner inconsistent 
with any of the provisions for 
disposition of existing stocks set forth in 
Unit VI, will be a violation of FIFRA. 
V. What is the Agency’s authority for 
taking this action? 
Section 6(f)(1) of FIFRA (7 U.S.C. 
136d(f)(1)) provides that a registrant of 
a pesticide product may at any time 
request that any of its pesticide 
registrations be canceled or amended to 
terminate one or more uses. FIFRA 
further provides that, before acting on 
the request, EPA must publish a notice 
of receipt of any such request in the 
Federal Register. Thereafter, following 
the public comment period, the EPA 
Administrator may approve such a 
request. The notice of receipt for this 
action was published for comment in 
the Federal Register of August 05, 2025 (90 FR 37504) (FRL–12719–01–OCSPP). 
The comment period closed on 
September 04, 2025. 
VI. Provisions for Disposition of 
Existing Stocks 
Existing stocks are those stocks of 
registered pesticide products which are 
currently in the United States, and 
which were packaged, labeled, and 
released for shipment prior to the 
effective date of the action. The existing 
stocks provision for the products subject 
to this order is as follows. 
The registrants may continue to sell 
and distribute existing stocks of 
products listed in Table 1 of Unit II 
until December 21, 2026, which is 1 
year after publication of this 
cancellation order in the Federal 
Register. Thereafter, the registrants are 
prohibited from selling or distributing 
products listed in Table 1 of Unit II, 
except for export in accordance with 
FIFRA section 17 (7 U.S.C. 136o) or for 
proper disposal. 
For the products listed in Table 1A of 
Unit II, the registrant has requested 18- 
months to sell existing stocks of those 
products. The registrant is permitted to 
sell or distribute products listed in 
Table 1A of Unit II, until June 21, 2027, 
a period of 18 months after publication 
of the cancellation order in this Federal 
Register. Thereafter, the registrant is 
prohibited from selling or distributing 
these products, except for export in 
accordance with FIFRA section 17 (7 
U.S.C. 136o) or for proper disposal. 
Now that EPA has approved product 
labels reflecting the requested 
amendments to terminate uses, 
registrants are permitted to sell or 
distribute products listed in Table 2 of 
Unit II, under the previously approved 
labeling until June 21, 2027, a period of 
18 months after publication of the 
cancellation order in this Federal 
Register, unless other restrictions have been imposed. Thereafter, registrants 
will be prohibited from selling or 
distributing the products whose labels 
include the terminated uses identified 
in Table 2 of Unit II, except for export

Persons other than the registrant may 
sell, distribute, or use existing stocks of 
canceled products and/or products

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To 
Aid Public Comment 
The Federal Trade Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’) has accepted, subject to 
final approval, an agreement containing 
a consent order from Illusory Systems, 
Inc., doing business as Nomad 
(‘‘Respondent’’). The proposed consent 
order (‘‘proposed order’’) has been 
placed on the public record for 30 days 
for receipt of comments from interested 
persons. Comments received during this 
period will become part of the public 
record. After 30 days, the Commission 
will again review the agreement and the 
comments received, then decide 
whether it should withdraw from the 
agreement and take appropriate action 
or make final the agreement’s proposed 
order. 
This matter involves Respondent’s 
software development practices. 
Respondent operated an online service, 
a token bridge, through which 
consumers could transfer assets to 
peers. 
The proposed complaint alleges that 
Respondent claimed to keep users’ 
assets secure, but in fact failed to 
implement reasonably secure software 
development practices. For example, the 
proposed complaint alleges that 
Respondent failed to: conduct adequate 
unit tests, implement a process for 
receiving and addressing third-party 
security vulnerability reports, have a 
Written Information Security Plan, and 
implement widely-known technologies 
that would mitigate critical loss of user 
funds. The proposed complaint alleges 
that as a result of Respondent’s failures, 
in August 2022, hackers exploited a 
significant vulnerability in the token 
bridge and took virtually all of its 
assets—worth approximately $186 
million. Even after Respondent 
recovered some assets and returned 
them to users, users of the bridge were 
left with losses that exceeded $100 
million worth of assets. 
The proposed complaint alleges that 
Respondent violated section 5(a) of the 
FTC Act by: (1) failing to employ 
reasonable and appropriate software 
development practices; and (2) 
misrepresenting that it implemented 
secure software development practices. 
The proposed order contains provisions 
designed to prevent Respondent from 
engaging in the same or similar acts or 
practices in the future. 
Part I prohibits Respondent from 
misrepresenting (1) the extent to which 
Respondent implements reasonable and 
appropriate software development 
practices; and (2) the extent to which it 
secures consumers’ financial assets. 
Part II requires Respondent to 
establish and implement, and thereafter 
maintain, a comprehensive information 
security program (‘‘Security Program’’) 
that protects the consumers’ financial 
assets. Part III requires Respondent to 
obtain initial and biennial data security 
assessments for ten years. Part IV 
requires Respondent to disclose all 
material facts to the assessor and 
prohibits Respondent from 
misrepresenting any fact material to the 
assessment required by Part III. 
Part V requires Respondent to submit 
an annual certification from a senior 
corporate manager (or senior officer 
responsible for its Security Program) 
that Respondent has implemented the 
requirements of the Order and is not 
aware of any material noncompliance 
that has not been corrected or disclosed 
to the Commission. Part VI requires 
Respondent to return recovered assets to 
users and to submit a report at the 
conclusion of the program summarizing 
its compliance. 
Part VII requires Respondent to 
submit an acknowledgement of receipt 
of the order, including all officers or 
directors and employees having 
managerial responsibilities for conduct 
related to the subject matter of the order, 
and to obtain acknowledgements from 
each individual or entity to which 
Respondent has delivered a copy of the 
order. 
Part VIII requires Respondent to file 
compliance reports with the 
Commission and to notify the 
Commission of bankruptcy filings or 
changes in corporate structure that 
might affect compliance obligations. 
Part IX contains recordkeeping 
requirements for accounting records, 
personnel records, consumer 
correspondence, advertising and 
marketing materials, and all records 
necessary to demonstrate compliance 
with the order. Part X contains other 
requirements related to the 
Commission’s monitoring of 
Respondent’s order compliance. 
Part XI provides the effective dates of 
the order, including that, with 
exceptions, the order will terminate in 
10 years. 
The purpose of this analysis is to 
facilitate public comment on the order, 
and it is not intended to constitute an 
official interpretation of the complaint 
or order, or to modify the order’s terms 
in any way. 
By direction of the Commission.

‘‘CAUTI events among patients with 
Spinal Cord Injury-associated 
Neurogenic Bladder (SCI–NB)’’ in the 
subject line. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 8, 2025, CDC published a 
request for information in the Federal 
Register (90 FR 43187). The initial comment period closed on December 8, 
2025. To allow interested parties 
additional time to submit comments, 
CDC is reopening the comment period 
for 45 days. CDC is committed to 
protecting patients and healthcare 
workers from adverse healthcare events 
and promoting safety, quality, and value 
in healthcare delivery. Preventing 
healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) 
is a priority for CDC and its partners in 
public health and healthcare. As part of 
this work, CDC supports surveillance of 
Catheter-associated Urinary Tract 
Infections (CAUTIs) and Non-Catheter- 
associated Urinary Tract Infections 
(UTIs) and other Urinary System 
Infections (USIs). 
UTIs are the fifth most common type 
of HAI, with an estimated 62,700 UTIs 
in acute care hospitals in 2015. UTIs 
account for more than 9.5% of 
infections reported by acute care 
hospitals.
1
Virtually all healthcare- 
associated UTIs are associated with 
instrumentation of the urinary tract. 
Approximately 12–16% of adult 
hospital inpatients will have an 
indwelling urinary catheter (IUC) at 
some time during their hospitalization, 
and each day the IUC remains, a patient 
has a 3–7% increased risk of acquiring 
a CAUTI.
23
The outcomes of CAUTIs 
include discomfort to the patient, 
prolonged hospital stays, and other 
serious health complications, including 
death.
4
It has been estimated that each 
year, more than 13,000 deaths are 
associated with UTIs.
5
 
Historically, the National Healthcare 
Safety Network has not collected data 
that specifically identify which patients 
with CAUTI events have Spinal Cord 
Injury-associated Neurogenic Bladder 
(SCI–NB). To enhance CDC’s 
understanding of the burden of CAUTIs 
in this patient population, a 
‘‘Neurogenic Bladder’’ risk factor 
variable has been added within the 
NHSN application. This variable allows 
NHSN users to indicate whether a 
CAUTI event occurred in patients with 
SCI–NB by using specific ICD–10–CM 
diagnosis codes. This new variable is 
currently optional. 
NHSN’s current definition of SCI–NB 
is in Chapter 7–UTI Events of the 
Patient Safety Component (PSC) manual 
(https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ 
pscmanual/pcsmanual_current.pdf). The SCI–NB ICD–10–CM diagnosis 
codes are available on the NHSN UTI 
Events web page (https://www.cdc.gov/ 
nhsn/xls/SCI-NB_ICD-10-CM.xlsx). Additionally, the ‘‘Neurogenic Bladder’’ 
variable is accessible within the NHSN 
application (https://sams.cdc.gov/). 
Note: The ‘‘Neurogenic Bladder’’ variable will be required starting January 2026. 
NHSN’s definition of SCI–NB will be 
expanded to include both traumatic and non- 
traumatic etiologies of spinal cord injuries 
also starting January 2026. 
This docket provides an opportunity 
for professionals who work with the 
SCI–NB patient population, as well as 
those who conduct NHSN UTI 
surveillance, to share their perspectives 
and concerns, which will help inform 
our decisions on the ‘‘Neurogenic 
Bladder’’ variable in the future. The 
CDC is also seeking additional insights 
into the unintended consequences of 
including the SCI–NB patient 
population in UTI surveillance, and 
public comments will help guide our 
approach moving forward. Specifically, 
CDC is interested in receiving 
information related to the following: 
1. What challenges or barriers might 
the required reporting of spinal cord 
injury-associated neurogenic bladder 
ICD–10–CM diagnosis codes within the 
NHSN application pose for your 
facility? How could these challenges or 
barriers be minimized? 
2. Would your facility be able to 
report the necessary procedure code 
data within 4.5 months of the end of the 
quarter in which the procedure 
occurred? If not, why not, and what is 
the shortest amount of time following 
the end of the quarter that the complete 
data would be available? 
3. At your facility, of the patients with 
spinal cord injury, what injury type or 
condition (ICD–10–CM diagnosis codes 
can be provided) is most strongly 
associated with CAUTIs? 
4. At your facility, have patients with 
spinal cord injury-associated neurogenic 
bladder experienced harms, 
complications, or any other unintended 
consequences from efforts to monitor 
and prevent CAUTIs?

Announcement of the Approval of 
COLA as an Accreditation 
Organization for the Specialties of 
Clinical Cytogenetics and 
Radiobioassay Under the Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments 
of 1988 
AGENCY: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), HHS. 
ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces the application of the Commission on 
Laboratory Accreditation (COLA) for 
approval as an accreditation 
organization for clinical laboratories 
under the Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments of 1988 
(CLIA) program for the specialties of 
Clinical Cytogenetics and 
Radiobioassay. We have determined that 
COLA meets or exceeds the applicable 
CLIA requirements. Consequently, we 
are granting COLA deeming authority 
for the specialties of Clinical 
Cytogenetics and Radiobioassay for a 
period of 5 years. 
DATES: This notice is applicable from January 20, 2026 to January 20, 2031. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sam Cyrus, (443) 896–4827. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
On October 31, 1988, Congress 
enacted the Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments of 1988 
(CLIA) (Pub. L. 100–578). CLIA 
amended section 353 of the Public 
Health Service Act. We issued a final 
rule implementing the accreditation 
provisions of CLIA on July 31, 1992 (57 
FR 33992). Under those provisions, 
CMS may grant deeming authority to an 
accreditation organization if its 
requirements for laboratories accredited 
under its program are equal to or more 
stringent than the applicable CLIA 
program requirements in 42 CFR part 
493 (Laboratory Requirements). Subpart 
E of part 493 (Accreditation by a Private, 
Nonprofit Accreditation Organization or 
Exemption Under an Approved State 
Laboratory Program) specifies the 
requirements an accreditation 
organization must meet to be approved 
by CMS as an accreditation organization 
under CLIA. 
II. Notice of Approval of COLA for the 
Specialties of Clinical Cytogenetics and 
Radiobioassay 
In this notice, we approve the 
Commission on Laboratory 
Accreditation (COLA) as an organization 
that may accredit laboratories for 
purposes of establishing their 
compliance with CLIA requirements for 
the specialties of Clinical Cytogenetics 
and Radiobioassay. We have examined 
the initial COLA application and all 
subsequent submissions to determine its 
accreditation program’s equivalency 
with the requirements for approval of an 
accreditation organization under 
subpart E of part 493. We have 
determined that COLA meets or exceeds 
the applicable CLIA requirements. We 
have also determined that COLA will 
ensure that its accredited laboratories 
will meet or exceed the applicable 
requirements in subparts H, I, J, K, M, 
Q, and the applicable sections of 
subpart R. Therefore, we grant COLA 
approval as an accreditation 
organization under subpart E of part 
493, for the period stated in the 
DATES 
section of this notice for the specialties 
of Clinical Cytogenetics and 
Radiobioassay. As a result of this 
determination, any laboratory that is 
accredited by COLA during the time 
period stated in the 
DATESsection of this 
notice will be deemed to meet the CLIA 
requirements for the specialties of 
Clinical Cytogenetics and 
Radiobioassay, and therefore, will 
generally not be subject to routine 
inspections by a State survey agency to 
determine its compliance with CLIA 
requirements. The accredited laboratory, 
however, is subject to validation and 
complaint investigation surveys 
performed by CMS, or its agent(s). 
III. Evaluation of COLA’s Request for 
Approval as an Accreditation 
Organization Under CLIA for the 
Specialties of Clinical Cytogenetics and 
Radiobioassay 
The following describes the process 
used to determine that COLA 
accreditation program meets the 
necessary requirements to be approved 
by CMS and that, as such, CMS may 
approve COLA as an accreditation 
program with deeming authority under 
the CLIA program. In reviewing these 
materials, we reached the following 
determinations for each applicable part 
of the CLIA regulations: 
Subpart E—Accreditation by a Private, 
Nonprofit Accreditation Organization or 
Exemption Under an Approved State 
Laboratory Program 
COLA submitted its mechanism for 
monitoring compliance with all 
requirements equivalent to condition- 
level requirements, a list of all its 
current laboratories and the expiration 
date of their accreditation, and a 
detailed comparison of the individual 
accreditation requirements with the 
comparable condition-level 
requirements. We have determined that 
COLA policies and procedures for 
oversight of laboratories performing 
laboratory testing for the specialties of 
Clinical Cytogenetics and Radiobioassay 
are equivalent to those required under 
the CLIA regulations in the matters of 
inspection, monitoring proficiency 
testing (PT) performance, investigating 
complaints, and making PT information 
available. COLA submitted 
documentation regarding its 
requirements for monitoring and 
inspecting laboratories and describing 
its standards regarding data 
management, the inspection process, 
procedures for removal or withdrawal of 
accreditation, notification requirements 
for laboratories out of compliance, and 
accreditation organization resources. We 
have determined that COLA’s 
requirements for monitoring and 
inspecting laboratories are equivalent to 
those required under our regulations for 
laboratories in the areas of data 
management, the inspection process, 
procedures for removal or withdrawal of 
accreditation, notification requirements 
for laboratories out of compliance, and 
accreditation organization resources. 
Therefore, we have determined that the 
requirements of the accreditation 
program submitted for approval are 
equal to or more stringent than the 
requirements of the CLIA regulations. 
Subpart H—Participation in Proficiency 
Testing for Laboratories Performing 
Nonwaived Testing 
We have determined that COLA’s 
requirements are equal to or more 
stringent than the CLIA requirements at 
§§ 493.801 through 493.865.

Nonwaived Testing 
We have determined that COLA’s 
requirements for the specialties of 
Clinical Cytogenetics and Radiobioassay 
are equal to or more stringent than the 
CLIA requirements at §§ 493.1100 
through 493.1105. 
Subpart K—Quality System for 
Nonwaived Testing 
We have determined that COLA’s 
requirements for the specialties of 
Clinical Cytogenetics and Radiobioassay 
are equal to or more stringent than the 
CLIA requirements at §§ 493.1200 
through 493.1299. 
Subpart M—Personnel for Nonwaived 
Testing 
We have determined that COLA’s 
requirements for the specialties of 
Clinical Cytogenetics and Radiobioassay 
are equal to or more stringent than the 
CLIA requirements at §§ 493.1403 
through 493.1495 for laboratories that 
perform moderate and high complexity 
testing. 
Subpart Q—Inspection 
We have determined that COLA’s 
requirements for the specialties of 
Clinical Cytogenetics and Radiobioassay 
are equal to or more stringent than the 
CLIA requirements at §§ 493.1771 
through 493.1780. 
Subpart R—Enforcement Procedures 
We have determined that COLA’s 
requirements for the specialties of 
Clinical Cytogenetics and Radiobioassay 
meet the requirements of subpart R to 
the extent that it applies to accreditation 
organizations. COLA policy sets forth 
the actions the organization takes when 
laboratories it accredits do not comply 
with its requirements and standards for 
accreditation. When appropriate, COLA 
will deny, suspend, or revoke 
accreditation in a laboratory accredited 
by COLA and report that action to us 
within 30 days. COLA also provides an 
appeal process for laboratories that have 
had accreditation denied, suspended, or 
revoked. 
We have determined that COLA’s 
laboratory enforcement and appeal 
policies are equal to or more stringent 
than the requirements of part 493 
subpart R as they apply to accreditation 
organizations. 
IV. Federal Validation Inspections and 
Continuing Oversight 
The Federal validation inspections of 
laboratories accredited by COLA may be 
conducted on a representative sample 
basis or in response to substantial 
allegations of noncompliance (that is, 
complaint inspections). The outcome of 
those validation inspections, performed 
by CMS or our agents, or the State 
survey agencies, will be our principal 
means for verifying that the laboratories 
accredited by COLA remain in 
compliance with CLIA requirements. 
This Federal monitoring is an ongoing 
process. 
V. Removal of Approval as an 
Accrediting Organization 
CLIA regulations at § 493.575 provide 
that we may rescind the approval of an 
accreditation organization, such as that 
of COLA, before the end of the effective 
date of approval in certain 
circumstances. For example, If we 
determine that COLA has failed to 
adopt, maintain and enforce 
requirements that are equal to, or more 
stringent than, the CLIA requirements, 
or that systemic problems exist in its 
monitoring, inspection or enforcement 
processes, we may impose a 
probationary period, not to exceed 1 
year, in which COLA would be allowed 
to address any identified issues. Should 
COLA be unable to address the 
identified issues within that timeframe, 
CMS may, in accordance with the 
applicable regulations, revoke COLA’s 
deeming authority under CLIA. 
Should circumstances result in our 
withdrawal of COLA’s approval, we will 
publish a notice in the Federal Register 
explaining the basis for removing its 
approval. 
VI. Collection of Information 
Requirements 
This document does not impose 
information collection requirements, 
that is, reporting, recordkeeping or 
third-party disclosure requirements. 
Consequently, there is no need for 
review by the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) under the authority of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The requirements 
associated with the accreditation 
process for clinical laboratories under 
the CLIA program, codified in 42 CFR 
part 493 subpart E, are currently 
approved by OMB under OMB control 
number 0938–0686. 
The Administrator of the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), 
Mehmet Oz, having reviewed and 
approved this document, authorizes 
Vanessa Garcia, who is the Federal 
Register Liaison, to electronically sign this document for purposes of 
publication in the Federal Register.

was not withdrawn from sale for reasons 
of safety or effectiveness. This 
determination means that FDA will not 
begin procedures to withdraw approval

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 
355(j)) allows the submission of an 
ANDA to market a generic version of a 
previously approved drug product. To 
obtain approval, the ANDA applicant 
must show, among other things, that the 
generic drug product: (1) has the same 
active ingredient(s), dosage form, route 
of administration, strength, conditions 
of use, and (with certain exceptions) 
labeling as the listed drug, which is a 
version of the drug that was previously 
approved, and (2) is bioequivalent to the 
listed drug. ANDA applicants do not 
have to repeat the extensive clinical 
testing otherwise necessary to gain 
approval of a new drug application 
(NDA). 
Section 505(j)(7) of the FD&C Act 
requires FDA to publish a list of all 
approved drugs. FDA publishes this list 
as part of the ‘‘Approved Drug Products 
With Therapeutic Equivalence 
Evaluations,’’ which is known generally 
as the ‘‘Orange Book.’’ Under FDA 
regulations, drugs are removed from the 
list if the Agency withdraws or 
suspends approval of the drug’s NDA or

the listed drug was withdrawn from sale

CFR 314.162). 
A person may petition the Agency to 
determine, or the Agency may 
determine on its own initiative, whether 
a listed drug was withdrawn from sale 
for reasons of safety or effectiveness. 
This determination may be made at any 
time after the drug has been withdrawn 
from sale, but must be made prior to 
approving an ANDA that refers to the 
listed drug (§ 314.161 (21 CFR 314.161)). 
FDA may not approve an ANDA that 
does not refer to a listed drug. 
EFFEXOR XR (venlafaxine 
hydrochloride) extended-release 
capsule, 100 mg, is the subject of NDA 
020699, held by Upjohn US, and 
initially approved on October 20, 1997. 
EFFEXOR XR is indicated in adults for 
the treatment of major depressive 
disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, 
social anxiety disorder and panic 
disorder. EFFEXOR XR (venlafaxine 
hydrochloride) extended-release 
capsule, 100 mg, is currently listed in 
the ‘‘Discontinued Drug Product List’’ 
section of the Orange Book. 
SciRegs International, Inc., on behalf 
of Inventia Healthcare Limited, 
submitted a citizen petition dated May 
16, 2025 (Docket No. FDA–2025–P– 
1304) under 21 CFR 10.30, requesting 
that the Agency determine whether 
EFFEXOR XR (venlafaxine 
hydrochloride) extended-release 
capsule, 100 mg, was withdrawn from 
sale for reasons of safety or 
effectiveness. 
After considering the citizen petition 
and reviewing Agency records and 
based on the information we have at this 
time, FDA has determined under 
§ 314.161 that EFFEXOR XR 
(venlafaxine hydrochloride) extended- 
release capsule, 100 mg, was not 
withdrawn for reasons of safety or 
effectiveness. The petitioner has 
identified no data or other information 
suggesting that EFFEXOR XR 
(venlafaxine hydrochloride) extended- 
release capsule, 100 mg, was withdrawn 
for reasons of safety or effectiveness. We 
have carefully reviewed our files for 
records concerning the withdrawal of 
EFFEXOR XR (venlafaxine 
hydrochloride) extended-release 
capsule, 100 mg, from sale. We have 
also independently evaluated relevant 
literature and data for possible 
postmarketing adverse events. We have 
found no information that would 
indicate that this drug product was 
withdrawn from sale for reasons of 
safety or effectiveness. 
Accordingly, the Agency will 
continue to list EFFEXOR XR 
(venlafaxine hydrochloride) extended- 
release capsule, 100 mg, in the 
‘‘Discontinued Drug Product List’’ 
section of the Orange Book. The 
‘‘Discontinued Drug Product List’’ 
delineates, among other items, drug 
products that have been discontinued 
from marketing for reasons other than 
safety or effectiveness. FDA will not 
begin procedures to withdraw approval 
of approved ANDAs that refer to this 
drug product. Additional ANDAs for 
this drug product may also be approved 
by the Agency as long as they meet all 
other legal and regulatory requirements 
for the approval of ANDAs. If FDA 
determines that labeling for this drug 
product should be revised to meet 
current standards, the Agency will 
advise ANDA applicants to submit such 
labeling.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
FDA is announcing the availability of 
a final guidance for industry entitled 
‘‘Processes and Practices Applicable to 
Bioresearch Monitoring Inspections.’’ 
This finalizes the draft guidance entitled 
‘‘Processes and Practices Applicable to 
Bioresearch Monitoring Inspections; 
Guidance for Industry,’’ which was 
announced in the Federal Register on 
June 5, 2024 (89 FR 48170) (hereafter, 
the ‘‘draft guidance’’). 
FDA is issuing this final guidance to 
comply with section 3612(b)(2) of the 
Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 
2022 (FDORA), enacted as part of the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. 
This provision of FDORA directs FDA 
to issue guidance describing the 
processes and practices applicable to 
inspections of certain sites and 
facilities, to the extent not specified in 
existing publicly available FDA guides 
and manuals for such inspections. 
These sites and facilities are inspected 
under FDA’s Bioresearch Monitoring 
(BIMO) inspection program. 
Specifically, this guidance addresses the 
following (to the extent not publicly 
available in FDA guides and manuals): 
the types of records and information 
required to be provided, best practices 
for communication between FDA and 
industry in advance of or during an 
inspection or request for records or 
other information, and other 
inspections-related conduct. 
FDA’s BIMO program is a 
comprehensive portfolio of programs 
designed to assess and monitor all 
aspects of the conduct and reporting of 
FDA-regulated research as well as 
certain postmarketing activities through 
on-site inspections, investigations, and 
Remote Regulatory Assessments. The 
BIMO program was established to assess 
the quality and integrity of data 
submitted to the Agency in support of 
regulatory decision-making, as well as 
to provide for protection of the rights, 
safety, and welfare of human and 
animal trial participants involved in 
FDA-regulated research. The program 
assesses compliance with statutory 
requirements and FDA’s regulations 
governing the conduct of nonclinical 
and clinical studies, and applicable 
postmarketing activities. 
FDA also is confirming that the 
following two guidances will be 
withdrawn upon publication of this 
guidance, as their substance is 
superseded by this final guidance and 
other guidances and related documents 
described in this final guidance: the 
2010 ‘‘Information Sheet Guidance For 
IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and 
Sponsors: FDA Inspections of Clinical 
Investigators,’’ and the 2006 
‘‘Information Sheet Guidance For IRBs, 
Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors: 
FDA Institutional Review Board 
Inspections.’’ 
FDA received 15 comments on the 
draft guidance. The comments primarily 
came from industry (including trade and 
professional associations). The comment 
period for the draft guidance ended on 
August 5, 2024. Commenters expressed 
interest in the Agency’s current 
practices with respect to accessing 
electronic databases during an 
inspection, the logistics of the Agency’s 
inspection pre-announcement notices 
and communications, and types of 
communication after an inspection. 
This final guidance reflects 
consideration of the public comments 
on the draft guidance. Specifically, the 
final guidance, among other things, 
contains changes to: (1) clarify the 
Agency’s practices for accessing and 
obtaining copies of electronic records; 
(2) provide additional details with 
respect to the Agency’s inspection pre- 
announcement notices and 
communications; and (3) offer 
additional information on post- 
inspection communications. 
This final guidance is being issued 
consistent with FDA’s good guidance 
practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115). 
The final guidance represents the 
current thinking of FDA on ‘‘Processes 
and Practices Applicable to Bioresearch 
Monitoring Inspections.’’ It does not 
establish any rights for any person and 
is not binding on FDA or the public. 
You can use an alternative approach if 
it satisfies the requirements of the 
applicable statutes and regulations. 
II. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
This guidance contains no collection 
of information. Therefore, clearance by 
the Office of Management and Budget 
under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995 is not required. 
III. Electronic Access 
Persons with access to the internet 
may obtain the revised guidance at

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501–3521), Federal 
Agencies must obtain approval from the 
Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) for each collection of 
information they conduct or sponsor. 
‘‘Collection of information’’ is defined 
in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 
1320.3(c) and includes Agency requests 
or requirements that members of the 
public submit reports, keep records, or 
provide information to a third party. 
Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA (44 
U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)) requires Federal 
Agencies to provide a 60-day notice in 
the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information, 
including each proposed extension of an 
existing collection of information, 
before submitting the collection to OMB 
for approval. To comply with this 
requirement, FDA is publishing notice 
of the proposed collection of 
information set forth in this document. 
With respect to the following 
collection of information, FDA invites 
comments on these topics: (1) whether 
the proposed collection of information 
is necessary for the proper performance 
of FDA’s functions, including whether 
the information will have practical 
utility; (2) the accuracy of FDA’s 
estimate of the burden of the proposed 
collection of information, including the 
validity of the methodology and 
assumptions used; (3) ways to enhance 
the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected; and (4) 
ways to minimize the burden of the 
collection of information on 
respondents, including through the use 
of automated collection techniques, 
when appropriate, and other forms of 
information technology. 
Required Warnings for Cigarette 
Packages and Advertisements—21 CFR 
part 1141 
OMB Control Number 0910–0877— 
Extension 
This information collection supports 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
regulations and guidance. Tobacco 
products are governed by chapter IX of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (sections 900 through 920) (21 
U.S.C. 387 through 21 U.S.C. 387t). 
On March 18, 2020, FDA issued a 
final rule establishing new cigarette 
health warnings for cigarette packages 
and advertisements entitled ‘‘Tobacco 
Products; Required Warnings for 
Cigarette Packages and Advertisements’’ 
(85 FR 15638; https://
www.federalregister.gov/d/2020-05223). The final rule implements a provision of 
the Family Smoking Prevention and 
Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control 
Act) (Pub. L. 111–31) that requires FDA 
to issue regulations requiring color 
graphics depicting the negative health 
consequences of smoking to accompany 
new textual warning label statements. 
The Tobacco Control Act amended 
section 4 of the Federal Cigarette 
Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 
(FCLAA) (15 U.S.C. 1333) to require 
each cigarette package and 
advertisement to bear one of the new 
required warnings. The 2020 final rule 
specifies the 11 new textual warning 
label statements and accompanying 
color graphics. 
Section 4(c) of the FCLAA and 21 CFR 
1141.10(g) sets forth the specific 
marketing requirements relating to the 
random and equal display and 
distribution of required warnings on 
cigarette packaging and quarterly 
rotation of required warnings in 
alternating sequence in cigarette 
advertising and requires the submission 
of plans outlining how the cigarette 
packaging and advertising will comply 
with such requirements. FDA must 
review and approve cigarette plans in 
advance of any person displaying or 
distributing cigarette packages or 
advertisements for products that are 
required to carry the required warnings, 
and a record of the FDA-approved plan 
must be established and maintained by 
the tobacco product manufacturer. 
To implement these statutory 
requirements, cigarette plans will be 
reviewed by FDA upon submission by 
respondents. FDA published an updated 
guidance document in September 2024, 
entitled ‘‘Submission of Plans for 
Cigarette Packages and Cigarette 
Advertisements (Revised)’’ which 
describes cigarette plans information, 
format and submission (https://
www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/ 
search-fda-guidance-documents/ 
submission-plans-cigarette-packages- 
and-cigarette-advertisements-revised). 
Pursuant to section 201(b) of the 
Tobacco Control Act, FDA finalized the 
‘‘Required Warnings for Cigarette 
Packages and Advertisements’’ rule with 
an effective date of June 18, 2021, 15 
months after the date of publication. 
Litigation is pending regarding the 
validity of the final rule. See R.J. 
Reynolds Tobacco Co. et al. v. United States Food and Drug Administration et 
al., No. 6:20–cv–00176 (E.D. Tex.), 25– 
40137 (5th Cir.); and Philip Morris USA 
Inc. et al. v. United States Food and Drug Administration et al., No. 2:24–cv– 
00143 (S.D. Ga.). FDA will provide 
updates regarding submission of 
cigarette plans as they are available. 
Visit FDA’s website https://
www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/labeling- 
and-warning-statements-tobacco- 
products/cigarette-labeling-and-health-

There are no capital costs or operating and maintenance costs associated with this collection of information. 
The burden estimates are based on 
FDA’s experience with information 
collections for other tobacco product 
plans (i.e., smokeless and cigars, consolidated under OMB control 
number 0910–0671) and 2023 Treasury 
Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade 
Bureau (TTB) data. 
FDA estimates up to 17 entities are 
affected annually. We estimate these 17 
entities will submit initial plans, and it 
will take an average of 150 hours per

for packaging and advertising for a total 
of 2,550 hours. We estimate that about 
half of respondents will submit a 
supplement each year. FDA estimates it 
will take respondents half the time per 
response to prepare and submit a 
supplement to an approved plan. We 
estimate receiving 8 supplements per 
year at 75 hours per response for a total 
of 600 hours. FDA estimates that the 
total annual hours for submitting initial 
plans and supplements will be 3,150. 
Based on a review of the information 
collection since our last request for 
OMB approval, our reporting burden 
estimate has reduced from 11,100 to 
3,150 hours annually. 
Section 1141.10(g)(4) establishes that 
each tobacco product manufacturer 
required to randomly and equally 
display and distribute warnings on 
cigarette packages or quarterly rotate 
warnings in cigarette advertisements in 
accordance with an FDA-approved plan 
under section 4 of the FCLAA and 21 
CFR part 1141 must maintain a copy of 
the FDA-approved plan (approved 
under § 1141.10(g)(3)). This copy of 
such FDA-approved plan must be 
available for inspection and copying by 
officers or employees of FDA. This 
subsection requires that the FDA- 
approved plan must be retained while 
in effect and for a period of not less than 
4 years from the date it was last in 
effect.

Numbers are rounded to the nearest whole number. 
FDA estimates that 51 recordkeepers 
will keep a total of about 76.5 (rounded 
to 77) records at 3 hours per record for 
a total of 231 hours. As stated 
previously, these estimates are based on 
FDA’s experience with information 
collections for other tobacco product 
plans (i.e., smokeless and cigars, consolidated under OMB control 
number 0910–0671). Based on our 
estimates for the submission of one- 
time, initial plans and supplements (i.e., 
that all respondents will submit one- 
time, initial plans and about half of 
respondents will submit supplements to 
FDA-approved plans), we estimate that 
each recordkeeper will keep an average 
of 1.5 records. 
FDA concludes that the required 
warnings for cigarette packages and 
cigarette advertisements in § 1141.10 are 
not subject to review by OMB because 
they do not constitute a ‘‘collection of 
information’’ under the PRA (44 U.S.C. 
3501–3520). Rather, these labeling 
statements are a ‘‘public disclosure’’ of 
information originally supplied by the 
federal government to the recipient for 
the purpose of ‘‘disclosure to the 
public’’ (5 CFR 1320.3(c)(2)). 
FDA estimates that the total burden 
for this information collection is 3,981 
hours annually (3,150 hours for 
reporting + 231 hours for 
recordkeeping). We have adjusted our 
burden estimate, which has resulted in 
a decrease to the currently approved 
burden. Our estimated reporting burden 
for the information collection reflects an 
overall decrease of 76 annual 
respondents and a corresponding 
decrease of 7,386 annual hours. We 
attribute this adjustment to a decrease in 
the number of submissions we received 
over the last few years.

Information Collection Request Title: 
Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program: 
Allocations Reports, OMB No. 0915– 
0318—Revision. 
Abstract: HRSA administers the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) 
authorized under Title XXVI of the 
Public Health Service Act. The RWHAP 
Allocations Reports allow HRSA to 
monitor and track the use of grant funds 
for compliance with statutory, program 
and grants requirements. To avoid 
duplication and reduce recipient 
reporting burden, HRSA created an 
electronic grantee contract management 
system (GCMS) that includes data 
required for the Allocations Reports. 
Recipients can access GCMS year-round 
to upload or manually enter data on 
their service provider contractors or 
subrecipients, the RWHAP core medical 
and support services provided, and their 
funding amounts. Data required for 
Allocations Reports are automatically 
prepopulated from GCMS.

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159536 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Notices Background Regarding Allocations 
and Expenditures Reports: Recipients 
funded under RWHAP Parts A, B, C, 
and D are required to report financial 
data to HRSA at the beginning 
(Allocations Report) and at the end 
(Expenditures Report) of their grant 
budget period. The Allocations Reports 
request information recipients already 
collect, including the use of RWHAP 
grant funds for core medical and 
support services; and on various 
program components, such as 
administration, planning and 
evaluation, and clinical quality 
management. Additionally, RWHAP 
Parts A and B recipients funded under 
the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. 
(EHE) initiative are also required to 
report allocations of the grant budget 
period in the EHE Allocations and 
Expenditure Reports. This allows HRSA 
to track and report progress toward 
meeting the EHE goals. 
For this submission, HRSA proposes 
to extend the following report forms in 
their current status: 
€RWHAP Part A Allocations Report €RWHAP Part B Allocations Report €RWHAP Part B Supplemental Allocations Report 
€RWHAP Part C Allocations Report €RWHAP Part D Allocations Report €Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative Allocations Report 
Need and Proposed Use of the 
Information: Accurate allocation records of recipients receiving RWHAP and EHE 
funding are necessary for HRSA to 
fulfill its monitoring and oversight 
responsibilities. 
Likely Respondents: RWHAP Part A, 
Part B, Part C, and Part D recipients. 
Burden Statement: Burden in this 
context means the time expended by 
persons to generate, maintain, retain, 
disclose, or provide the information 
requested. This includes the time 
needed to review instructions; to 
develop, acquire, install, and use 
technology and systems for the purpose 
of collecting, validating and verifying 
information, processing and 
maintaining information, and disclosing 
and providing information; to train 
personnel and to be able to respond to 
a collection of information; to search 
data sources; to complete and review 
the collection of information; and to 
transmit or otherwise disclose the 
information. The total annual burden 
hours estimated for this ICR are 
summarized in the table below. HRSA 
expects a small decline of 268 burden 
hours compared to the currently 
approved collection, due to RWHAP 
recipients’ familiarity with the updated 
reporting requirements introduced in 
the currently approved collection.

Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), the 
University of California, Davis (UC 
Davis) intends to repatriate certain 
cultural items that meet the definition of 
objects of cultural patrimony and that 
have a cultural affiliation with the 
Indian Tribes or Native Hawaiian 
organizations in this notice. 
DATES: Repatriation of the cultural items in this notice may occur on or after 
January 20, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: Send additional, written requests for repatriation of the cultural 
items in this notice to Megon Noble, 
NAGPRA Project Manager, University of 
California, Davis, 251 Mrak Hall, One 
Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, email

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice is published as part of the 
National Park Service’s administrative 
responsibilities under NAGPRA. The 
determinations in this notice are the 
sole responsibility of UC Davis, and 
additional information on the 
determinations in this notice, including 
the results of consultation, can be found 
in the summary or related records. The 
National Park Service is not responsible 
for the determinations in this notice. 
Abstract of Information Available 
A total of five cultural items or lots 
have been requested for repatriation. 
The objects of cultural patrimony are 
three baskets, one lot of 13 pieces of 
dentalium shell money, and one chert 
flake tool. The University is unaware of 
any specific treatment of the individual 
objects of cultural patrimony with 
pesticides, preservatives, or other 
substances that represent a potential 
hazard to the objects or to persons 
handling the objects. However, records 
located in the Department of 
Anthropology Museum indicate that 
approximately 
1
3of the Merriam 
collection had been treated with Berlou, 
a dry mothproofing substance used as 
an insecticide, in 1964. It is unknown 
which baskets were treated. 
Two of the objects of cultural 
patrimony, CHM 705 and 706, were 
purchased in Bucksport in Humboldt 
Bay, California on September 13, 1910. 
These two baskets were most likely 
made by Mrs. Jerry James (Wiyot). CHM 
1501 includes 13 pieces of dentalium 
shell money pieces purchased on 
September 14, 1910, from a Humboldt 
Bay Soo-lah’-te-luk (Wiyot) woman who 
was also possibly Mrs. Jerry James. CHM 
707 is a mortar basket that Merriam 
purchased in October 1921 in Humboldt 
Bay from an unknown Soo-lah’-te-luk 
(Wiyot) woman. UCDA–1106 is a chert 
flake tool, from the UC Davis 
Department of Anthropology teaching 
collection with very little provenience 
other than it was surface collected by 
Dr. Robert Bettinger in the 1960s to 70s 
in Fortuna, in Humboldt County, CA– 
HUM–15. 
Determinations 
UC Davis has determined that: 
€The five objects of cultural patrimony described in this notice have 
ongoing historical, traditional, or 
cultural importance central to the 
Native American group, including any 
constituent sub-group (such as a band, 
clan, lineage, ceremonial society, or 
other subdivision), according to the 
Native American traditional knowledge 
of an Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian 
organization. 
€There is a reasonable connection between the cultural items described in 
this notice and the Wiyot Tribe, 
California. 
Requests for Repatriation 
Additional, written requests for 
repatriation of the cultural items in this 
notice must be sent to the authorized 
representative identified in this notice 
under 
ADDRESSES. Requests for 
repatriation may be submitted by any 
lineal descendant, Indian Tribe, or 
Native Hawaiian organization not 
identified in this notice who shows, by 
a preponderance of the evidence, that 
the requestor is a lineal descendant or 
a culturally affiliated Indian Tribe or 
Native Hawaiian organization. 
Repatriation of the cultural items in 
this notice to a requestor may occur on 
or after January 20, 2026. If competing 
requests for repatriation are received, 
the UC Davis must determine the most 
appropriate requestor prior to 
repatriation. Requests for joint 
repatriation of the cultural items are 
considered a single request and not 
competing requests. The UC Davis is 
responsible for sending a copy of this 
notice to the Indian Tribes and Native 
Hawaiian organizations identified in 
this notice and to any other consulting 
parties.

remaining objects associated with 
human remains from 22DS506 (McKay’s 
Store) previously listed in a Notice of 
Inventory Completion published in the 
Federal Register on January 22, 2021 
(FR 2021–01340) have been identified. 
The five lots of associated funerary 
objects consist of one lot Native 
American ceramics, one lot lithics, one 
lot clay, one lot faunal remains, and one 
lot shell. Some of these objects were 
collected as a surface collection in 1972 
by the University of Memphis and a 
1950s surface collection was given to 
the C.H. Nash Museum at Chucalissa in 
1984. Both collections were transferred 
to the DeSoto County Museum between 
2013–2015 and then to MDAH in 2019. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified 
from 22DS509 (Edgefield). The three 
lots of associated funerary objects 
consist of one lot lithics, one lot Native 
American ceramics, and one lot clay. 
The human remains and some of the 
objects are associated with the 2013 
Mississippi Mound Trail excavations. 
Additional objects were excavated by 
the University of Memphis in 1962. The 
collection saw a series of transfers from 
the C.H. Nash Museum at Chucalissa to 
the DeSoto County Museum between 
2013–2015 and then to the MDAH in 
2019. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified 
from 22DS511 (Dogwood Ridge). The 10 
lots of associated funerary objects 
consist of one lot lithics, one lot shell, 
one lot Native American ceramics, one 
lot clay, one lot ochre, one lot organic 
materials, one lot faunal remains, one 
lot discoidal, one lot wood, and one lot 
petrified wood. MDAH has collections 
from multiple excavations and surveys 
at 22DS511 spanning over 20 years. A 
surface collection was removed by the 
University of Memphis as part of the 
Tennessee Archaeological survey in 
1972. Another surface collection took 
place when they revisited the site in 
1998–1999. There is also a collection 
from a 1977 burial salvage excavation 
conducted by the Mississippi 
Department of Archives and History. 
No human remains are present; the 
remaining objects associated with 
human remains from 22DS512 
(Shannon Mound) previously listed in a 
Notice of Inventory Completion 
published in the Federal Register on 
January 22, 2021 (FR 2021–01340) have 
been identified. The five lots of 
associated funerary objects consist of 
one lot faunal remains, one lot Native 
American ceramics, one lot clay, one lot 
lithics, and one lot shell. A collection 
was removed from the surface of the site 
by Memphis State University in 1971 
and transferred to the DeSoto County 
Museum in 2015 and then to MDAH in 
2019. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified 
from 22DS513 (Norfolk). The six lots of 
associated funerary objects consist of 
one lot Native American ceramics, one 
lot petrified wood, one lot faunal 
remains, one lot lithics, one lot clay, 
and one lot organic materials. A 
collection removed from the surface of 
the site in 1989 by the University of 
Memphis. The collection was 
transferred from the DeSoto County 
Museum to MDAH in 2019. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
18 individuals have been identified 
from 22DS514 (Cheatham). The 12 lots 
of associated funerary objects consist of 
one lot clay, one lot effigy, one lot 
ceramics, one lot lithics, one lot faunal 
remains, one lot shell, one lot organic 
materials, one lot beads, one lot ochre, 
one lot wood, one lot earspool, and one 
lot discoidal. The human remains and 
objects were removed from the site by 
Memphis State University and C.H. 
Nash Museum at Chucalissa staff in 
1971, 1972, 1991, and 1997. The 
Principal Investigator (PI) for the 1997 
surface collection was Dr. David H. Dye. 
These collections were housed at the 
C.H. Nash Museum at Chucalissa and 
were then transferred to the DeSoto 
County Museum between 2013–2015. In 
2019, the collection was transferred to 
MDAH. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
nine individuals have been identified 
from 22DS516 (Irby). The 14 lots of 
associated funerary objects consist of 
one lot lithics, one lot clay, one lot 
faunal remains, one lot shell, one lot 
Native American ceramics, one lot 
organic materials, one lot discoidal, one 
lot petrified wood, one lot ochre, one lot 
finescreen, one lot effigy, one lot gorget, 
one lot samples, and one lot bead. The 
collection consists of human remains 
and objects removed from the site in 
1966, 1967, and 1972 by staff from the 
Memphis State University and C.H. 
Nash Museum at Chucalissa as well as 
some objects removed prior to 1997, and 
some objects removed from the site at 
unknown point. These collections were 
all housed at the C.H. Nash Museum at 
Chucalissa until 2013–2015, when they 
were transferred to the DeSoto County 
Museum. In 2019, they were transferred 
to MDAH. Additional collections 
consisting of materials and human 
remains were removed from the site 
between 1989–1990 during a 
‘‘Controlled Surface Collection’’ and 
some material removed from test 
excavations conducted in 1992 by M.E. 
Starr and Memphis State University 
(Lee Foster). Lastly, there is an 
unprovenienced ‘‘DAP’’ survey 
collection. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
14 individuals have been identified 
from 22DS517 (Woodlyn). The 14 lots of 
associated funerary objects consist of 
one lot lithics, one lot ceramics, one lot 
organic materials, one lot faunal 
remains, one lot shell, one lot clay, one 
lot wood, one lot petrified wood, one lot 
finescreen, one lot matrix, one lot effigy, 
one lot ochre, one lot beads, and one lot 
discoidal. Surveys were conducted by 
Memphis State University in 1972 and 
1978 (J. Guyer). At some point the 
collections were given to the C.H. Nash 
Museum at Chucalissa. A systematic 
surface collection in 1989 under the 
direction of Alfred L. Foster (Memphis 
State University) was conducted at the 
site and both objects and human 
remains were collected and given to the 
C.H. Nash Museum at Chucalissa. 
Objects and human remains were 
removed from the site during two 
University of Memphis led field school 
seasons that took place in 1997 and 
1998. These collections were brought to 
the C.H. Nash Museum at Chucalissa. 
These collections, as well as a collection 
with an unknown history, were all 
transferred from the C.H. Nash Museum 
at Chucalissa to the DeSoto County 
Museum between 2013–2015. However, 
some of the artifacts from the 1997 field 
excavation were accidentally sent to the 
Arkansas Archaeological survey from 
the C.H. Nash Museum at Chucalissa. 
However, once identified as coming 
from 222DS517, they were transferred to 
the DeSoto County Museum in 2019, 
and so they were able to be included in 
the 2019 transfer of all these collections 
to MDAH. 
No human remains are present; the 
remaining objects associated with 
human remains from 22DS519 
(Shannon #2) previously listed in a 
Notice of Inventory Completion 
published in the Federal Register on 
January 22, 2021 (FR 2021–01340) have 
been identified. The two lots of 
associated funerary objects consist of 
one lot Native American ceramics and 
one lot lithics. A collection removed by 
Memphis State University in 1971 was

Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified. No 
associated funerary objects are present. 
This individual was removed from an 
unnamed archaeological site, 
(14LY304), located along the Verdigris 
River in Lyon County, eastern KS. 
14LY304 was excavated in June of 1965 
after Tom Witty, Kansas State Historical 
Society (KSHS) reported the Mound on 
the site was endangered by a flood 
control project and plans for dam 
construction in the Upper Verdigris 
Watershed area. Excavations were 
funded by the University of Kansas (KU) 
and field records note that the Mound 
was constructed from layers of 
limestone fragments and slabs. The 1965 
excavations noted significant evidence 
of looting in the center of the Mound, 
and the only objects encountered were 
historic materials. The age of the 
14LY304 site is currently not 
determined, likely due to extensive 
looting at the Mound. The human 
remains were examined by William Bass 
at the University of Kansas (KU) 
Museum of Natural History between 
1965 and 1966. Bass likely retained this 
individual and brought them to UTK in 
1971. To our knowledge, no hazardous 
substances were used to treat any of the 
remains. 
Cultural Affiliation

remains of one individual of Native 
American ancestry. 
€There is a connection between the human remains described in this notice 
and the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, 
Oklahoma; Kaw Nation, Oklahoma;

Abstract of Information Available 
Ancestral remains representing, at 
least, two individuals have been 
identified. The one associated funerary 
object is one lot of unworked animal 
bone. The David Page site (20SL2) is 
located in Sanilac County, Michigan. In 
July of 1947, the Ancestors and object 
were removed by a property owner and 
donated to the University of Michigan 
Museum of Anthropological 
Archaeology (UMMAA) in August of 
1947. The Ancestors are an adult 35–60 
years male, and an adult 22–45 years 
female. Dating for the site is to the 
Woodland 850 BC—1400 AD based on 
burial treatment. 
The University of Michigan has no 
record of, nor do its officials have any 
knowledge of, any treatment of the 
Ancestral remains and associated 
funerary objects with pesticides, 
preservatives, or other substances that 
represent a potential hazard to the 
collection(s) or to persons handling the 
collection(s). 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is reasonably identified by the 
geographical location or acquisition 
history of the Ancestral remains and 
associated funerary object described in 
this notice.

Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing, at least, 
31 individuals have been identified 
from the Taylor Mound, five miles east 
of White Cloud, Doniphan County, KS. 
Mark E. Zimmerman removed these 
ancestors from the mound in 1915 and 
donated them to the PMAE the same 
year. The four associated funerary 
objects are four lots consisting of 
ceramic items and faunal remains. 
A total of three associated funerary 
objects are three lots consisting of 
ceramic and stone items from the Taylor 
Mound, five miles east of White Cloud, 
Doniphan County, KS. Mark E. 
Zimmerman and Edward L Parks Sterns 
collected these cultural items as part of 
the PMAE Missouri Valley Expedition 
in 1915. 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is clearly identified by the 
information available about the human 
remains and associated funerary objects 
described in this notice. 
Determinations 
The PMAE has determined that: 
€The human remains described in this notice represent the physical 
remains of 31 individuals of Native 
American ancestry. 
€The seven objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have 
been placed intentionally with or near 
individual human remains at the time of 
death or later as part of the death rite 
or ceremony. 
€There is a connection between the human remains and associated funerary

Abstract of Information Available 
Based on the information available, 
human remains representing, at least, 
seven individuals have been reasonably 
identified. No associated funerary 
objects are present. The human remains 
were transferred to the OSA BP in 
March of 2024 by Kansas State 
University professor, Mike Finnegan. 
The original burial location of the 
remains is unknown as Finnegan 
excavated throughout Iowa. The 
taphonomic conditions of the human 
remains do however suggest an original 
burial location in the Loess Hills of 
Western Iowa. Two partial crania 
represent two adult males and 
commingled remains represent a 
minimum of three adults, with two 
identified as males. The commingled 
remains also include a minimum of two 
juveniles, an 8-to-12 year old and a 12- 
to-15 year-old (BP3859). No hazardous 
substances have been used to treat the 
human remains. 
Based on the information available, 
human remains representing, at least, 
one individual has been reasonably 
identified. No associated funerary 
objects are present. At an unknown 
time, a partial cranium was recovered 
on a sandbar from an unspecified river 
in western Iowa and brought to Mark 
Anderson at the Sanford Museum in 
Cherokee Iowa. Anderson transferred 
the remains to the OSA BP in December 
of 2024. The partial cranium represents 
an older adult male individual. The 
human remains have taphonomic 
evidence of long-term inundation in 
water; the original burial location is 
unknown (BP3922). No hazardous 
substances have been used to treat the 
human remains. 
Based on the information available, 
human remains representing at least one 
individual have been reasonably 
identified. No associated funerary 
objects are present. In February 2025 a 
right ulna was identified during an 
inventory of the Paul Rowe collection, 
known to largely be from sites in 
western Iowa, and transferred to the 
OSA BP (BP3935). The partial right ulna 
is represented by the distal portion and 
the midshaft. A faint line at the distal 
epiphysis indicates fusion completed 
only recently and that the individual 
was a young adult. The original burial 
location is unknown but was likely in 
Mills County, Iowa as Paul Rowe 
collected and documented Native 
American sites throughout the county 
from the 1920s to the 1960s. No

Based on the information available, 
human remains representing at least one 
individual have been reasonably 
identified. No associated funerary 
objects are present. In July of 2024 
kayakers identified the human remains 
on a sand bar in the East Nishnabotna 
River in Pottawattamie County, Iowa. 
The Pottawattamie County Sheriff’s 
office first handled the investigation and 
sent the human remains to the Iowa 
State Medical Examiner’s Office where 
they were determined not of 
medicolegal significance. The human 
remains were transferred to the OSA BP 
in February of 2025. A young to middle- 
aged adult female is represented by a 
partial cranium with evidence of long- 
term inundation and river transport. 
The original burial location is unknown 
as the human remains had been 
displaced by river erosion; the location 
in which they were found is 
documented as 13PW402 in the Iowa 
Site File (BP3936). No hazardous 
substances have been used to treat the 
human remains. 
Based on the information available, 
human remains representing, at least 
one individual have been reasonably 
identified. No associated funerary 
objects are present. In August of 2024 
human remains were discovered on a 
sandbar in the Little Sioux River in 
Woodbury County. After Woodbury 
County police sent the human remains 
to the Iowa State Medical Examiner (24– 
07558) they were determined to be of 
ancient context and transferred to the 
OSA in February 2025. Dark cortical 
coloration and taphonomic rounding of 
exposed sutures and broken surfaces 
indicates long term inundation and river 
transport. Site 13WD260 was assigned 
to the find spot; the individual’s original 
burial location is unknown. An adult 
male is represented by a partial cranium 
(BP3937). No hazardous substances 
have been used to treat the human 
remains. 
Based on the information available, 
human remains representing at least one 
individual have been reasonably 
identified. These human remains were 
displaced from an unknown location by 
river erosion on the Floyd River and 
discovered by a kayaker south of 
Merrill, IA. They were reported to and 
recovered by the Plymouth County 
Sherriff’s Office in late August 2025. 
The human remains were transferred to 
the OSA September 25, 2025. Dark 
cortical coloration and taphonomic 
rounding of exposed sutures and broken 
surfaces indicates long term inundation 
and river transport. Site 13PM286 was 
assigned to the find spot. An adult 
female is represented by a partial 
cranium (BP3992). No hazardous 
substances have been used to treat the 
human remains.

Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing, at least, 
16 individuals have been identified. 
Skeletal analyses indicate that the 
generally fragmentary remains include 
seven adult males, three adult females, 
one young adult female, two adults of 
indeterminate sex, one adolescent 
female, one child, and one infant. No 
known individuals were identified. The 
23 associated funerary objects include 
18 pine nut beads, and five worked 
antler artifacts. An additional stone 
projectile point tip is embedded in the 
sternum of one individual. Although 
more burial-associated objects were 
collected by the donor, only part of his 
collection was donated to the Museum. 
The human remains and artifacts were 
removed in the early 1940s by W.T. 
Edmundson and William Laughlin from 
Khustenate, also known as 35CU157, an 
Athabaskan village and burial site in 
Curry County, OR, formerly on private 
land and now within current Samuel H. 
Boardman State Park. They were 
donated by Edmundsen, a private 
individual, and accessioned in 1947. 
Laughlin was that time a professor at the 
University of Oregon. Upon leaving the 
University in 1955, Laughlin removed 
some Khustenate remains to subsequent 
institutions he was employed at, 
resulting in the dispersal of the 
collection. 
The village at Khustenate was 
reported in 1874 by Paul Schumacher, 
who observed housepits, a cemetery, 
and an extensive midden. Subsequent 
radiocarbon dating of shell samples 
from the reposited midden yielded dates 
of 450±70 RYBP and 320±60 RYBP. The 
assemblage and presence of 
Euroamerican trade items confirms that 
the site was used in Late Prehistoric and 
Early Historic times. Historical 
Documents, ethnographic sources, oral 
history, and Native American traditional 
knowledge indicate that the Tututni 
people have occupied this area of the 
southern Oregon coast since pre-contact 
times. 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is reasonably identified by the 
geographical location or acquisition 
history of the human remains and 
associated funerary objects described in 
this notice. 
Determinations 
The University of Oregon Museum of 
Natural and Cultural History has 
determined that: 
€The human remains described in this notice represent the physical 
remains of at least 16 individuals of 
Native American ancestry.

in ceremonies, rituals, formal events, 
and worn in battles to embody mana 
(cultural, spiritual, religious power) and 
mo‘oku¯‘auhau (genealogy) that support 
a ruling chief’s ability to project his 
authority. Its physical presence holds 
symbolic, sacred, and ritual significance 
as expressed in its appearance and 
design at times made of feathers 
removed from the mahi‘ole of a defeated 
chief taken in battle.

€The one sacred object/object of cultural patrimony described in this 
notice is, according to the Native 
American traditional knowledge of an 
Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian 
organization, a specific ceremonial 
object needed by a traditional Native 
American religious leader for present- 
day adherents to practice traditional 
Native American religion, and have 
ongoing historical, traditional, or 
cultural importance central to the 
Native American group, including any 
constituent sub-group (such as a band, 
clan, lineage, ceremonial society, or 
other subdivision). This mahi‘ole is 
needed by a traditional religious leader 
for present-day adherents to renew the 
traditional Native Hawaiian religious 
ceremony of ‘ike pa¯pa¯lua, which 
involves spiritual communication with 
their ancestors.

transferred to Dr. Max Goldstein of St. 
Louis, MO where they were stored and 
possibly displayed at his private 
museum within the Central Institute for 
the Deaf. Following the death of Dr. 
Goldstein, his estate transferred control 
of the Ancestors and associated funerary 
objects to the Missouri Historical 
Society in 1958.

Abstract of Information Available 
A total of one cultural item and two 
lots of artifacts from Hamilton County, 
Tennessee have been requested for 
repatriation. 
Site 40HA52, Hamilton County, TN: 
One lot of faunal remains identified on

exists as to the circumstances of original 
collection. There is no known exposure 
to hazardous substances or treatments. 
Site 40HA407, Hamilton County, TN:

Abstract of Information Available 
A total of 51 lots of cultural items in 
the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of 
Anthropology (Museum) at the 
University of California, Berkeley have 
been requested for repatriation. 
In 1907, with the financial 
sponsorship of Phoebe A. Hearst, Alfred 
L. Kroeber acquired 49 lots of objects of 
cultural patrimony from Morongo 
Reservation, Riverside County, 
California toward the establishment of 
the Museum. The objects of cultural 
patrimony include bows, arrows, 
baskets, vessels, seed beaters, carrying 
nets, bone tools, and stone tools. 
In 1927, Horatio Shumway Lee 
donated one object of cultural 
patrimony, a basket, to the Museum. 
Museum records note the basket as 
having been collected by Sarah E. 
Gilman, a teacher from the U.S. Indian 
Day School, Potrero, on Morongo Band 
of Mission Indians’ reservation. 
In 1965, the Heintz family donated 
one object of cultural patrimony to the 
Museum. The object of cultural 
patrimony is a basket with a tag 
indicating it was made in Morongo. 
Collections and collection spaces at 
the Phoebe A Hearst Museum of 
Anthropology were treated with 
substances for preservation and pest 
control, some potentially hazardous. No 
records have been found to date at the 
Museum to indicate whether or not 
chemicals or natural substances were 
used prior to 1960. 
Determinations 
The University of California, Berkeley 
has determined that: 
€The 51 lots of objects of cultural patrimony described in this notice have 
ongoing historical, traditional, or 
cultural importance central to the 
Native American group, including any 
constituent sub-group (such as a band, 
clan, lineage, ceremonial society, or 
other subdivision), according to the 
Native American traditional knowledge 
of an Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian 
organization. 
€There is a reasonable connection between the cultural items described in 
this notice and the Morongo Band of 
Mission Indians, California. 
Requests for Repatriation 
Additional, written requests for 
repatriation of the cultural items in this 
notice must be sent to the authorized 
representative identified in this notice

Abstract of Information Available 
Based on the informational available, 
human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been reasonably 
identified. The individual was 
discovered on March 31, 1995, by an 
archaeological monitor along the 
cutbank of the road between Rancheria 
Court and the water tank, close to a rock 
shelter site at CA–MRP–382. The human 
remains were then accessioned into the 
Yosemite National Park collections 
(YOSE–6108). No associated funerary 
objects are present. 
Based on the information available, 
human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been reasonably 
identified. The individual was 
discovered on June 24, 1997, by a 
camper within Yosemite National Park 
at Housekeeping camp. The individual 
later found in the park collections with 
a note detailing the information above 
but was never accessioned into the 
collections. No associated funerary 
objects are present. 
In April 2014, human remains and 
associated funerary objects were 
removed from the Yosemite Village Site 
Complex (CA–MRP–056/H), during a 
subsurface survey (2014E). The intent of 
the survey was to further identify and 
characterize the area of potential effect 
for the rehabilitation of two buildings 
that comprise the Yosemite Valley 
Emergency Services Complex. Based on 
the information available, human 
remains representing, at least, 10 
individuals have been reasonably 
identified. The 63 associated funerary 
objects are three lots light bulb 
fragments, three sherds of glass 
fragments, four lots of glass fragments, 
two lots of mixed metal, two wire nail 
fragments, seven lots of wire nail 
fragments, one lot of burned milled 
wood, one slightly charred milled wood 
fragment, two lots of milled wood, one 
electrical fuse, two lots of ceramic sewer 
pipe fragments, one whiteware ceramic 
sherd, one lot of obsidian and chert 
debitage, one lot of obsidian and 
volcanic debitage, 24 lots of obsidian 
debitage, three edge-modified obsidian 
fragments, one obsidian discoidal edge- 
modified fragment, one projectile point 
fragment, one granite manuport, one lot 
of obsidian biface fragments, and one 
rodent bone. 
In January 2016, human remains and 
associated funerary objects were 
removed from the Yosemite Village Site 
Complex (CA–MRP–056/H), during a 
subsurface survey (2015E). The intent of 
the survey was to resolve an adverse 
effect to the site from rehabilitation of 
the Yosemite Valley Emergency Services 
Complex. Based on the information 
available, human remains representing, 
at least, 36 individuals have been 
reasonably identified. The 186 
associated funerary objects are three 
glass pieces, one shell button fragment, 
four obsidian tinklers, one obsidian 
perforator, one granite manuport, one 
obsidian drill, two granite handstones, 
eight steatite vessel fragments, one 
granite cobble tool, three obsidian edge- 
modified pieces (oval scrapers), 42 
obsidian edge-modified pieces, one lot 
of obsidian edge-modified piece 
fragments, three rose spring contracting 
stem projectile points, four rose spring 
corner notched points, one elko corner- 
notched projectile point, one large 
stemmed dart point, three stone cores, 
one obsidian exhausted core, seven

Abstract of Information Available 
A total of one cultural item has been 
requested for repatriation. The one 
sacred object is a pipe bowl and stem 
(MNHS #1797 A,B). According to the 
history inscribed on the pipe stem, the 
pipe belonged to Medweganoonnid (also 
spelled Mdwegwanonind and Mah- 
deva-ga-no-nind), ‘‘the head chief of the 
Red Lake Indians—Ojibways’’ and was 
gifted to Bishop Henry Benjamin 
Whipple (d.1901) by Chief Kay-bay-no- 
ding, son of Medweganoonnid. The pipe 
was purchased by the Minnesota 
Daughters of the Revolution Chapters in 
1939 as part of the Bishop Whipple 
Indian Collection, which was later 
transferred to Minnesota Historical 
Society as part of the Sibley House 
transfer by the Sibley House Association 
of the Minnesota Daughters of the 
American Revolution on May 21, 1996. 
No potentially hazardous substances are 
known to have been used to treat this 
item. 
Determinations 
The Minnesota Historical Society has 
determined that: 
€The one sacred object described in this notice is a specific ceremonial 
object needed by a traditional Native 
American religious leader for present- 
day adherents to practice traditional

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice is published as part of the 
National Park Service’s administrative 
responsibilities under NAGPRA. The 
determinations in this notice are the 
sole responsibility of the University of 
Oregon Museum of Natural and Cultural 
History, and additional information on 
the determinations in this notice,

can be found in its inventory or related 
records. The National Park Service is 
not responsible for the determinations 
in this notice. 
Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified. 
The 12 associated funerary objects 
include eight items of worked bone, one 
non-human tooth, a pestle fragment, and 
a small string of glass beads, and an 
undientifiable stone object. The 
fragmentary human remains (catalogued 
as 11–541 and also 1–12172) are from an 
adult of indeterminate age and sex. The 
human remains and funerary objects 
were collected by a private individual in 
1933 and donated to the Museum in 
1946. They are attributed to Port 
Orchard. While primary accessions 
records attribute them to Oregon, the 
present town of Port Orchard lies to the 
north in the state of Washington. It is 
alternatively possible that the collection 
is from Port Orford, Oregon. Records 
state that ‘‘data were given from 
memory—no written records.’’ While 
the exact nature of the burial association 
is unknown, the artifacts originated at 
the same location and they are not 
inconsistent with funerary objects. 
Based on these, the burial would date to 
proto-historic or post Euroamerican 
contact times. Port Orchard, Washington 
is the historic territory of Coast Salish 
peoples. Port Orford is the historic 
territory of Kwatami peoples. 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is reasonably identified by the 
geographical location or acquisition 
history of the human remains and 
associated funerary objects described in 
this notice. 
Determinations 
The University of Oregon Museum of 
Natural and Cultural History has 
determined that: 
€The human remains described in this notice represent the physical 
remains of one individual of Native 
American ancestry 
€The 12 objects described in this notice are reasonably believed to have 
been placed with or near individual 
human remains at the time of death or 
later as part of the death rite or 
ceremony. 
€There is a connection between the human remains and associated funerary 
objects described in this notice and the 
Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians of 
Oregon; Coquille Indian Tribe; 
Muckleshoot Indian Tribe; Port Gamble 
S’Klallam Tribe; Puyallup Tribe of the 
Puyallup Reservation; Skokomish 
Indian Tribe; Squaxin Island Tribe of 
the Squaxin Island Reservation; and the 
Suquamish Indian Tribe of the Port 
Madison Reservation.

Abstract of Information Available 
FLMNH has identified human 
remains representing at least 90 
individuals from seven sites across 
Duval and St. Johns Counties, Florida in 
the collections. There are a total of 
15,427 associated funerary objects 
across sites including beads, ceramics, 
fauna, shell, red ochre, buttons, lead, 
glass, lithics, and other items. Each site 
is described individually below. 
(1) Brown Saxon (8DU62) is a 9.9- 
hectare multicomponent site that covers 
a large section of the interior part of the 
Theodore Roosevelt Preserve. The site 
runs parallel to the shoreline, although 
it is found on the higher ground inland 
from the marsh’s edge. It was originally 
documented by William H. Sears. Sears 
performed three FLMNH museum 
expeditions in 1955, 1957, and 1959. 
The artifacts and human remains 
housed in the FLMNH originate from 
these expeditions. Human remains 
representing at least 41 individuals have 
been identified. The 615 associated 
funerary objects are pottery and fauna 
remains. 
(2) Goodman (8DU66A) is located on 
the east bank of Mill Cove on the south 
side of the St. Johns River. In the spring 
of 1961, through the FLMNH, Douglas F. 
Jordon conducted excavations of this 
mound on property owned by Morris 
Goodman who was in the process of 
subdividing the land for development. 
Human remains representing at least 29 
individuals have been identified (25 
subadults and four adults). The 
approximately 3,500 associated funerary 
objects include pottery sherds, worked 
bone, bone/shell beads, stone tools, 
shell, and red ochre. 
(3) McCormack (8DU66) is a 
multicomponent site located on the east 
side of Mill Cove. The site once 
consisted of a mound (Goodman Mound 
(8DU66A)) and an extensive shell 
midden. McCormack was first 
investigated by William H. Sears in 
1955. The results of these excavations 
showed extensive occupation over long 
dure´e. Artifacts and human remains 
housed at the FLMNH originate from 
expeditions by Sears. Human remains 
representing, at least, seven individuals 
have been identified (one subadult and 
six adults). The 131 associated funerary 
objects include 74 catalogs of faunal and 
shell, as well as 57 catalogs of pottery, 
glass and lithic from the burial mound 
context, including Tests one and three.

Augustine, St. Johns County, Florida, 
located south of the present-day plaza in 
downtown St. Augustine. The holdings 
at the FLMNH come from excavations 
carried out at the site by the Historic St. 
Augustine Preservation Board in 1986. 
Excavations were undertaken due to 
proposed development on the parking 
lot area south of the Fiesta Mall. These 
excavations revealed that the site ranges 
from the First Spanish period (1565– 
1763) to the 20th century, containing 
late 16th and early 17th century burials 
that are associated with the St. 
Augustine parish church of Nuestra 
Sen˜ora de los Remedios (Our Lady of 
Remedies). All burials at the site were 
Christian style burials (oriented East- 
West, shroud burials). Human remains 
representing at least nine individuals 
have been identified. The 8,079 
associated funerary objects include 
fragments of iron, ceramic, mortar, 
buttons, lead, a copper lace tip, 
charcoal, burned clay, fauna, shell, 
wood, and slag, among others. 
(5) Ribera Gardens (SA12–26) is a 
historic site in St. Augustine, St. Johns 
County, Florida. The site includes a 
midden where this Ancestor was 
recovered and was excavated by the 
Historic St. Augustine Preservation 
Borad (HSAPB) in 1989. These 
excavations found that the site ranges 
from the First Spanish period (1565– 
1763) to the 20th century. In 1999, after 
the HSAPB was dissolved, collections 
from this site were transferred to the 
FLMNH by the State of Florida 
Legislative mandate. Human remains 
representing, at least, one individual has 
been identified. The 747 associated 
funerary objects include metal, glass, 
pottery, and other fragments and a 
button. 
(6) Spanish Hospital (SA28–1) is in 
St. Augustine of St. Johns County, 
Florida, located south of the present-day 
plaza in downtown St. Augustine. 
Excavations at this site were carried out 
by the Historic St. Augustine 
Preservation Board (HSAPB) in 1979. 
The collections from these excavations 
were later donated to the FLMNH in 
1992. The excavations revealed several 
Christian style burials associated with 
the St. Augustine Parish Church of 
Nuestra Sen˜ora de los Remedios (Our 
Lady of Remedies). The burials date to 
the 16th and early 17th centuries and 
were disturbed by 18th, 19th, and 20th 
century activities. Only one burial was 
recorded to have been excavated and 
analyzed. Human remains representing, 
at least, two individuals have been 
identified. The 188 associated funerary 
objects include Native American 
ceramics, clothing, beads, pipes, tools, 
and gunflint. 
(7) Summer Haven (8SJ46) is a 
prehistoric shell midden located south 
of the Mantanzas Inlet in St. Johns 
County, Florida. According to Bullen 
and Bullen (1961), the site spans the late 
Orange Period (1000 BC). The 
excavators describe how the midden 
had been damaged by road construction 
in the 1950s. From this midden, the 
FLMNH houses collections from various 
museum expeditions led by Ripley P. 
Bullen, which were transferred from the 
Florida Park Service and the 
Anthropology Department at the 
University of Florida, as well as 
donations between 1959 and 1982. 
Human remains representing at least 
one individual has been identified. 
There are approximately 2,167 
associated funerary objects including 
fauna, pottery fragments, shell, a pick, a 
hammer, a fishhook, and other 
miscellaneous items.

Abstract of Information Available 
Based on the information available, 
human remains representing two 
individuals have been reasonably 
identified from two different locations. 
One associated funerary object has been 
identified. 
On July 31, 2022, a single cranial bone 
was discovered on a sand bar in the 
Little Missouri River in Billings County, 
North Dakota. This was exposed by a 
significant flooding event and reported 
to the Billings County Sheriff’s 
Department, who transferred custody to 
the Billings County Medical Examiner 
on August 3, 2022. The medical 
examiner determined the remains to be 
the parietal bone of an adult human 
predating the present time. No 
associated funerary objects were 
identified. 
On October 19, 2024, a human 
cranium was discovered along a deep, 
heavily eroded ravine in McKenzie 
County, North Dakota. This was 
reported to the McKenzie County 
Sheriff’s Department and was originally 
thought to be a modern forensics case. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI) took custody of the remains and 
determined that the cranium belonged 
to a Native American, likely female, that 
predates the present time and is not a 
forensic matter. The one associated 
funerary object is a bone awl. 
Determinations 
The Dakota Prairie Grasslands has 
determined that: 
€The human remains described in this notice represent the physical 
remains of two individuals of Native 
American ancestry. 
€The one object described in this notice is reasonably believed to have 
been placed intentionally with or near 
individual human remains at the time of 
death or later as part of the death rite 
or ceremony. 
€The Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, 
Montana and the Three Affiliated Tribes 
of the Fort Berthold Reservation, North 
Dakota have priority for disposition of 
the human remains or cultural item 
described in this notice. 
Claims for Disposition

Abstract of Information Available 
A total of three cultural items have 
been requested for repatriation. The 
three sacred objects are a makau 
(fishhook), kapa (bark cloth), and a 
moena lauhala (mat). The makau was 
collected by Dr. Alex H. Bailey around 
1900, and then given to Laura Hecox of 
Santa Cruz, CA. The records for the 
kapa indicate that it was also collected 
about 1900 in Hawaii, and was at some 
point prior to 1905 given to Laura 
Hecox. The records for the moena 
lauhala indicate that it was collected in 
the ‘‘South Sea Islands’’ in the late 19th 
or early 20th century, and has 
subsequently been identified as 
Hawaiian in consultation with Hui Iwi 
Kuamo1o. The Santa Cruz Museum of 
Natural History has no records that 
indicate that any of these cultural items 
were treated with potentially hazardous 
substances. 
Determinations 
The Santa Cruz Museum of Natural 
History has determined that: 
€The three sacred objects described in this notice are specific ceremonial 
objects needed by a traditional Native 
American religious leader for present- 
day adherents to practice traditional 
Native American religion, according to 
the Native American traditional 
knowledge of a lineal descendant, 
Indian Tribe, or Native Hawaiian 
organization.

Abstract of Information Available 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified. No 
associated funerary objects are present. 
This individual was removed from the 
Curry Farm site (14GR301) between 
1963 and 1964. The Curry Farm site is 
located along the Verdigris River in 
Greenwood County, KS and dates to the 
Middle Woodland Greenwood Phase (c. 
120–600 CE), with unspecified earlier 
Archaic components. The site was 
identified by the landowner in 1963, 
H.C. Curry, who exposed human 
remains while digging on the property. 
Curry notified Tom Witty, Kansas State 
Historical Society (KSHS), who led 
salvage excavations between 1963 and 
1964. The individual housed at UTK 
was removed during these salvage 
excavations and sent by Witty to 
William Bass for examination in 
October of 1965 at University of Kansas 
(KU). Records indicate that Bass likely 
retained this individual and brought 
them to UTK in 1971. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified. 
The three lots of associated funerary 
objects are ceramics, lithics, and other 
objects placed with or near human 
remains. This individual and the 
associated funerary objects were likely 
removed from unnamed archaeological 
site in Riley County, KS (14RY302) by 
a local collector and donated to KSHS 
in 1961. The 14RY302 site is 
multicomponent, and reports suggest 
these remains and objects likely date to 
the Late Archaic component of the site 
(c. 1000 BCE). The remains were sent to 
William Bass by Tom Witty for 
examination at KU in 1964. A note from 
Tom Witty, dated August 10th, 1961, 
was present with the human remains 
and identified 14RY301, Strafuss, as the 
location the human remains and objects 
were removed from. Review of records 
from KSHS and UTK by KSHS staff 
indicates 14RY302 is the correct site 
location. It is likely this individual and 
the associated objects were retained by 
Bass and brought with him to UTK in 
1971. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual have been identified. No 
associated funerary objects are present. 
This individual was removed from an 
unknown location in Butler County, KS 
on an unknown date. Records indicate 
this individual was sent to William Bass 
at KU by the Butler County Sheriff for 
examination after they were confiscated 
by law enforcement. Bass sent his 
determination to the Butler County 
Sheriff in a memo dated July 29th, 1969. 
This individual was likely retained by 
Bass and transported with him when he 
came to UTK in 1971. A preservative 
was applied to some of the remains at 
some point after Bass retained them. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
two individuals, have been identified. 
The three lots of associated funerary 
objects are ceramics, lithics, and other 
objects placed with or near human 
remains. These remains were removed 
from an unknown location in Morris 
County, KS on an unknown date by an 
unknown individual. Based on patterns 
of past practice, it is likely that these 
individuals were retained by Bass in 
Kansas and brought with him to UTK in 
1971. 
Human remains representing, at least, 
one individual, have been identified. No 
associated funerary objects are present. 
This individual was removed from an 
unknown location in Kansas by an 
unknown individual on an unknown 
date. UTK has no records related to this 
individual, but based on past patterns of 
practice, it is likely they came to UTK 
through Bass. 
Information regarding the presence of 
potentially hazardous substances has 
previously been shared with consulting 
parties. 
Cultural Affiliation 
Based on the information available 
and the results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is clearly identified by the 
information available about the human 
remains and associated funerary objects 
described in this notice.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
Antitrust Division 
Notice Pursuant to the Defense 
Production Act of 1950 
AGENCY: Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice. 
ACTION: Notice of review of voluntary agreement. 
SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given pursuant to section 708 of the Defense 
Production Act of 1950 (‘‘DPA’’), that 
the Assistant Attorney General finds, 
with respect to the Implementing 
Voluntary Agreements Under the 
Defense Production Act (‘‘Voluntary 
Agreement’’) proposed by the 
Department of Energy (‘‘DOE’’), that the 
purposes of section 708(c)(1) of the DPA 
may not reasonably be achieved through 
a voluntary agreement having less 
anticompetitive effects or without any 
voluntary agreement. Given this finding, 
the proposed Voluntary Agreement may 
become effective following the 
publication of this notice. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the DPA, DOE may enter into plans with 
representatives of private industry for 
the purpose of improving the efficiency 
with which private firms contribute to 
the national defense when conditions 
exist that may pose a direct threat to the 
national defense or its preparedness. 
Such arrangements are generally known 
as ‘‘voluntary agreements.’’ Participants 
in an existing voluntary agreement may 
adopt documented methods, known as 
‘‘plans of action,’’ to implement that 
voluntary agreement. A defense to 
actions brought under the antitrust laws 
is available to each participant acting 
within the scope of a voluntary 
agreement and plan of action that has 
come into force under the DPA. 
The DPA requires that each proposed 
plan of action be reviewed by the 
Attorney General prior to becoming 
effective. If, after consulting with the 
Chair of the Federal Trade Commission, 
the Attorney General finds that the 
purposes of the DPA’s plans of action 
provision ‘‘may not reasonably be 
achieved through a . . . voluntary 
agreement having less anticompetitive 
effects or without any . . . voluntary 
agreement,’’ the voluntary agreement 
may become effective. 50 U.S.C.

Division. 28 CFR 0.40(l). 
Executive Order 14,302 
‘‘Reinvigorating the Nuclear Fuel Base’’, 
90 FR 22595 (‘‘E.O. 14,302’’) required 
the Secretary of Energy, in coordination 
with the Attorney General and the 
Chairman of the Federal Trade 
Commission, to utilize authority 
provided to the President in section 
708(c)(1) of the Defense Production Act 
to seek voluntary agreements with 
domestic nuclear energy companies to 
provide for the national defense. The 
purpose of the proposed Voluntary 
Agreement is to establish a consortium 
and plans of action to ensure that the 
domestic nuclear fuel supply chain 
capacity is available to enable the 
continued reliable operation of the 
Nation’s existing and future nuclear 
reactors. The phases of the domestic 
nuclear fuel supply chain that will be 
addressed in the consortium and plans 
of action include milling, conversion, 
enrichment, deconversion, fabrication, 
recycling and reprocessing, end users, 
and Uranium Fuel Infrastructure 
Resilience Mechanism (‘‘UFIRM’’). The 
consortium will allow for consultation 
with domestic nuclear energy 
companies to discuss and implement 
methods to enhance the capability to 
manage spent nuclear fuel to ensure the 
continued reliable operation of domestic 
nuclear reactors. DOE has certified that 
the proposed Voluntary Agreement is 
necessary to carry out its purpose, as 
specified in E.O. 14,302. 
DOE requested that the Assistant 
Attorney General, Antitrust Division, 
pursuant to the Attorney General’s 
delegation of authority under 28 CFR 
0.40(i), issue a finding that the proposed 
Voluntary Agreement satisfies the 
statutory criteria set forth in 50 U.S.C. 
4558(f)(1)(B). The Assistant Attorney 
General, Antitrust Division, reviewed 
the proposed Voluntary Agreement and 
consulted with the Chair of the Federal 
Trade Commission. On December 12, 
2025, by letter to Assistant Secretary for 
Nuclear Energy Thedore J. Garrish, Gail 
Slater, Assistant Attorney General, 
Antitrust Division, issued a finding, 
pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 4558(f)(1)(B), that 
the purposes of the DPA’s plans of 
action provision ‘‘may not reasonably be 
achieved through a . . . plan of action 
having less anticompetitive effects or 
without any . . . plan of action.’’

According to the OSC and Agency records, 
Registrant’s registration expired on July 31, 2025. 
RFAAX 1, at 2. The fact that a registrant allows his 
registration to expire during the pendency of an 
administrative enforcement proceeding does not 
impact the Agency’s jurisdiction or prerogative 
under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to 
adjudicate the OSC to finality. Jeffrey D. Olsen, 
M.D., 84 FR 68474, 68476–79 (2019). 2
Based on the Government’s submissions in its 
RFAA dated September 9, 2025, the Agency finds 
that service of the OSC on Registrant was adequate. 
Specifically, the Government’s Declaration from a 
DEA Diversion Investigator (DI) indicates that on 
July 29, 2025, Registrant was personally served with 
a copy of the OSC. RFAAX 2, at 1; see also id. at 
3 (Form-DEA 12 signed by Registrant, 
acknowledging receipt of the OSC).

Under the Administrative Procedure Act, an 
agency ‘‘may take official notice of facts at any stage 
in a proceeding—even in the final decision.’’

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 556(e), ‘‘[w]hen an agency 
decision rests on official notice of a material fact 
not appearing in the evidence in the record, a party 
is entitled, on timely request, to an opportunity to 
show the contrary.’’ The material fact here is that 
Registrant, as of the date of this decision, is not 
licensed as a nurse practitioner in North Carolina. 
Accordingly, Registrant may dispute the Agency’s 
finding by filing a properly supported motion for 
reconsideration of findings of fact within fifteen 
calendar days of the date of this Order. Any such 
motion and response shall be filed and served by 
email to the other party and to the DEA Office of 
the Administrator, Drug Enforcement 
Administration at dea.addo.attorneys@dea.gov.

This rule derives from the text of two provisions 
of the CSA. First, Congress defined the term 
‘‘practitioner’’ to mean ‘‘a physician . . . or other 
person licensed, registered, or otherwise permitted, 
by . . . the jurisdiction in which he practices ..., to distribute, dispense, . . . [or] administer . . . a 
controlled substance in the course of professional 
practice.’’ 21 U.S.C. 802(21). Second, in setting the 
requirements for obtaining a practitioner’s 
registration, Congress directed that ‘‘[t]he Attorney 
General shall register practitioners . . . if the 
applicant is authorized to dispense . . . controlled 
substances under the laws of the State in which he 
practices.’’ 21 U.S.C. 823(g)(1). Because Congress 
has clearly mandated that a practitioner possess 
state authority in order to be deemed a practitioner 
under the CSA, DEA has held repeatedly that 
revocation of a practitioner’s registration is the

Drug Enforcement Administration 
Timothy Balisky, N.P.; Decision and 
Order 
On July 28, 2025, the Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA or 
Government) issued an Order to Show 
Cause (OSC) to Timothy Balisky, N.P., 
of Huntersville, North Carolina 
(Registrant). Request for Final Agency 
Action (RFAA), Exhibit (RFAAX) 1 at 1, 
4. The OSC proposed the revocation of 
Registrant’s Certificate of Registration, 
No. MB7242352, alleging that 
Registrant’s registration should be 
revoked because Registrant is ‘‘currently 
without authority to prescribe, 
administer, dispense, or otherwise 
handle controlled substances in the 
State of North Carolina, the state in 
which [he is] registered with DEA.’’ Id. 
at 2 (citing 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3)).
1
 
The OSC notified Registrant of his 
right to file a written request for hearing, 
and that if he failed to file such a 
request, he would be deemed to have 
waived his right to a hearing and be in 
default. Id. at 2–3 (citing 21 CFR 1301.43). Here, Registrant did not 
request a hearing, and the Agency finds 
him to be in default. RFAA, at 2–3.
2
‘‘A 
default, unless excused, shall be 
deemed to constitute a waiver of the 
registrant’s/applicant’s right to a hearing 
and an admission of the factual 
allegations of the [OSC].’’ 21 CFR 
1301.43(e). 
Further, ‘‘[i]n the event that a 
registrant . . . is deemed to be in 
default . . . DEA may then file a request 
for final agency action with the 
Administrator, along with a record to 
support its request. In such 
circumstances, the Administrator may 
enter a default final order pursuant to 
[21 CFR] 1316.67.’’ Id. 1301.43(f)(1). Here, the Government has requested 
final agency action based on Registrant’s 
default pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.43(c), 
(f), 1301.46. RFAA, at 1; see also 21 CFR 
1316.67. 
Findings of Fact 
The Agency finds that, in light of 
Registrant’s default, the factual 
allegations in the OSC are deemed 
admitted. According to the OSC, 
effective May 13, 2025, the North 
Carolina State Board of Nursing issued 
an Order of Summary Suspension, 
suspending Registrant from the practice 
of nursing in North Carolina. RFAAX 1, 
at 2. According to North Carolina online 
records, of which the Agency takes 
official notice,
3
the current status of 
Registrant’s North Carolina nurse 
practitioner license is ‘‘No License due 
to Discipline.’’ North Carolina Board of 
Nursing License Verification, https://
portal.ncbon.com/licenseverification/ 
search.aspx (last visited date of signature of this Order). Accordingly, 
the Agency finds that Registrant is not 
licensed as a nurse practitioner in North 
Carolina, the state in which he is 
registered with DEA.

Attorney General is authorized to 
suspend or revoke a registration issued 
under 21 U.S.C. 823 ‘‘upon a finding 
that the registrant . . . has had his State 
license or registration suspended . . . 
[or] revoked . . . by competent State 
authority and is no longer authorized by 
State law to engage in the . . . 
dispensing of controlled substances.’’ 
With respect to a practitioner, DEA has 
also long held that the possession of 
authority to dispense controlled 
substances under the laws of the state in 
which a practitioner engages in 
professional practice is a fundamental 
condition for obtaining and maintaining 
a practitioner’s registration. Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 270 (2006) (‘‘The Attorney General can register a 
physician to dispense controlled 
substances ‘if the applicant is 
authorized to dispense . . . controlled 
substances under the laws of the State 
in which he practices.’ . . . The very 
definition of a ‘practitioner’ eligible to 
prescribe includes physicians ‘licensed, 
registered, or otherwise permitted, by 
the United States or the jurisdiction in 
which he practices’ to dispense 
controlled substances. 802(21).’’). The 
Agency has applied these principles 
consistently. See, e.g., James L. Hooper, M.D., 76 FR 71371, 71372 (2011), pet. for rev. denied, 481 F. App’x 826 (4th 
Cir. 2012); Frederick Marsh Blanton,

North Carolina law permits licensed nurse 
practitioners to handle controlled substances 
provided certain requirements are met. See 21 N.C. Admin. Code 36.0809 (2024); N.C. Gen. Stat. 90– 
87(22)(a). 
According to North Carolina statute, 
‘‘dispense’’ means ‘‘to deliver a 
controlled substance to an ultimate user 
or research subject by or pursuant to the 
lawful order of a practitioner, including 
the prescribing, administering, 
packaging, labeling, or compounding 
necessary to prepare the substance for 
that delivery.’’ N.C. Gen. Stat. 90–87(8) 
(2024). Further, a ‘‘practitioner’’ means 
a ‘‘physician . . . or other person 
licensed, registered or otherwise 
permitted to distribute, dispense, 
conduct research with respect to or to 
administer a controlled substance so 
long as such activity is within the 
normal course of professional practice 
or research in [the] State.’’ Id. at 90– 87(22)(a).

Here, the undisputed evidence in the 
record is that Registrant lacks authority 
to practice as a nurse practitioner in 
North Carolina. As discussed above, an 
individual must be a licensed 
practitioner to dispense a controlled 
substance in North Carolina. Thus, 
because Registrant lacks authority to 
practice as a nurse practitioner in North 
Carolina and, therefore, is not 
authorized to handle controlled 
substances in North Carolina, Registrant 
is not eligible to maintain a DEA 
registration. Accordingly, the Agency 
will order that Registrant’s DEA 
registration be revoked. 
Order 
Pursuant to 28 CFR 0.100(b) and the 
authority vested in me by 21 U.S.C. 
824(a), I hereby revoke DEA Certificate

to Timothy Balisky, N.P. Further, 
pursuant to 28 CFR 0.100(b) and the 
authority vested in me by 21 U.S.C. 
823(g)(1), I hereby deny any pending 
applications of Timothy Balisky, N.P., to 
renew or modify this registration, as 
well as any other pending application of 
Timothy Balisky, N.P., for additional 
registration in North Carolina. This

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The primary mission of EOIR is to adjudicate 
immigration cases by fairly, 
expeditiously, and uniformly 
interpreting and administering the 
Nation’s immigration laws. Under 
delegated authority from the Attorney 
General, EOIR conducts immigration 
court proceedings, appellate reviews, 
and administrative hearings. 
EOIR is required under 8 U.S.C. 
1158(d)(4) and 1229(b)(2) to maintain a 
list of pro bono legal service providers 
who are available to represent 
individuals who are placed in 
immigration proceedings before EOIR 
and the Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS). The EOIR Office of 
Policy maintains the List, which must 
be updated on a quarterly basis. 8 U.S.C. 
1158(d)(4), 1229(b)(2). The List is 
provided to individuals in immigration 
proceedings and contains information 
on non-profit organizations and 
attorneys who have committed to 
providing at least 50 hours per year of 
pro bono legal services before the 
immigration court with respect to which 
they appear on the List. The List also 
contains information on pro bono 
referral services that refer individuals in 
immigration court proceedings to pro 
bono counsel. The rules for qualifying 
organizations, pro bono referral services, 
and attorneys to be placed on the List 
can be found at 8 CFR 1003.61 et seq. 
EOIR uses an electronic information 
system to manage records related to the 
List more efficiently; simplify the 
application process for providers 
through the external-facing web-based 
Pro Bono List User Portal; allow 
providers to update to their own contact

Information in this system is 
safeguarded in accordance with 
appropriate laws, rules, and policies, 
including automated systems security 
and access policies of EOIR and the 
Department. Access to information is 
limited to Department personnel who 
have an official need for access in order 
to perform their duties. Physical records

I. Abstract 
This collection of information 
supports the National Aeronautics and 
Space Act of 1958, as amended, to 
enable NASA astronaut appearances 
before a variety of groups to inform the 
general public about the U.S. space 
program. Typically, presentations are 
made to high schools and universities, 
community organizations, businesses 
and associations, or military 
organizations. In order to reach as many 
people as possible, NASA offers three 
options to choose from in requesting an 
astronaut appearance: 
(1) An in-person astronaut appearance 
whereby the astronaut travels to the 
appearance location. 
(2) A virtual appearance utilizing 
virtual telecommunications tools to 
connect an astronaut via video 
conference with your organization. 
(3) A recorded greeting arranged in 
advance to be used during a specified 
event. 
The NASA Astronaut Appearance 
Office (AAO) located at the Lyndon B. 
Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, 
Texas is responsible for vetting, 
processing, and coordinating logistics 
for Astronaut appearances. This 
information will be used by the NASA 
AAO and Legal and Human Resources 
personnel in the vetting, coordinating, 
scheduling and authorization processes 
to work with requestors to facilitate the 
appearance logistics. Records of 
appearances, including the information 
associated with the requestor and points 
of contact, are maintained by the AAO 
for a minimum of five (5) years.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Abstract 
Based on continued user feedback 
provided during operations of the 
NASA STEM Gateway (Universal 
Registration and Data Management 
System) and increased utilization, 
NASA plans to develop updates/ 
enhancements to improve information 
collected in compliance with policy 
guidance and the overall user 
experience in the NASA STEM 
Gateway. The NASA STEM Gateway 
(Universal Registration and Data 
Management System) is a 
comprehensive tool designed to allow 
learners (i.e., students, educators, non- students or educators, and awardee 
principal investigators) to apply to 
NASA STEM engagement opportunities 
(e.g., internships, fellowships, challenges, educator professional 
development, experiential learning 
activities, etc.) in a single location. 
NASA personnel manage the selection 
of applicants and implementation of 
engagement opportunities within the 
NASA STEM Gateway. The information 
collected will be used by the NASA 
Office of STEM Engagement (OSTEM) 
and other NASA offices to review 
applications for participation in NASA 
STEM engagement opportunities. The 
information is reviewed by OSTEM 
project and activity managers, as well as 
NASA mentors who would be hosting 
students. This information collection 
will consist of profile information (e.g., 
name, contact information, citizenship, 
education or affiliate organization, etc.) 
and the NASA STEM Engagement 
opportunity application information. In 
addition to supporting applicant review 
and participant selection, individual 
learner profile data will enable NASA 
OSTEM to fulfill federally mandated 
reporting on its STEM engagement 
activities and report relevant participant 
information as needed for Agency 
performance goals and success criteria 
(annual performance indicators).

II. Background 
The NRC is issuing for public 
comment a draft PA between the NRC, 
U.S. Bureau of Land Management 
(BLM), U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), South Dakota State 
Historic Preservation Office (SD SHPO), 
and Powertech. The NRC staff is 
pursuing execution of a PA pursuant to 
paragraph 800.4(b)(2) of title 36 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (36 CFR) to 
satisfy its obligations under Section 106 
of the NHPA for Powertech’s license 
renewal request for the Dewey-Burdock 
ISR. The Dewey-Burdock ISR project is 
located in Custer and Fall River 
counties, South Dakota, and has not 
been constructed. 
On March 4, 2024, Powertech, which 
is the United States-based wholly 
owned subsidiary of enCore Energy 
Corp., submitted a license renewal 
application to the NRC for the Dewey- 
Burdock ISR project in accordance with 
part 40 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations, ‘‘Domestic Licensing of Source Material.’’ Powertech requested 
renewal of its NRC license for a 20-year 
term. On March 31, 2025, Powertech 
updated its license renewal application. 
Powertech proposes to recover uranium 
using the ISR method where a liquid 
solution is injected into the ore body to 
mobilize uranium, which is then 
pumped to the surface and processed to 
produce yellowcake. The Dewey- 
Burdock ISR project would consist of 
processing facilities and sequentially- 
developed wellfields sited in two 
contiguous areas, the Burdock area and 
the Dewey area. 
On August 9, 2024, the NRC issued a 
notice for an opportunity to request a 
hearing and to petition for leave to 
intervene (89 FR 65401) for Powertech’s 
request to renew source and byproduct 
materials license SUA–1600. 
III. Discussion 
The NRC staff has determined a 
phased process for compliance with 
Section 106 of the NHPA is appropriate 
for this undertaking, as specifically 
permitted under 36 CFR 800.4(b)(2), 
Section 106 implementing regulations. 
Pursuant to 36 CFR 800.8, the NRC is 
coordinating its Section 106 process 
with its review under the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as 
amended. 
In accordance with 36 CFR 
800.2(c)(1)(i), the NRC staff initiated its 
Section 106 consultation with the SD 
SHPO for this undertaking, including 
preparation of this PA, via letter dated 
January 24, 2025. 
In response to NRC staff’s letter dated 
January 24, 2025, the BLM designated 
the NRC as the lead agency for 
compliance with requirements of 
Section 106 of the NHPA regarding the 
Dewey-Burdock ISR project pursuant to 
36 CFR 800.2(a)(2). The NRC staff also 
invited the EPA to participate in the 
Section 106 process for this 
undertaking, and on November 14, 
2025, the EPA designated the NRC as 
the lead agency for compliance with 
requirements of Section 106 of the 
NHPA pursuant to 36 CFR 800.2(a)(2). 
On January 24, 2025, the NRC staff 
notified the Advisory Council on 
Historic Preservation (ACHP) of the 
undertaking and invited the ACHP to 
participate in NHPA Section 106 
consultation. By letter dated October 14, 
2025, the ACHP notified the NRC that 
Appendix A of the Section 106 
implementing regulations, ‘‘Criteria for 
Council Involvement in Reviewing 
Individual Section 106 Cases,’’ 
implementing regulations at 36 CFR part 
800, does not apply to the undertaking 
and, therefore, its participation in the 
consultation to resolve adverse effects is 
not necessary. By letters dated January 
24, 2025, the NRC invited 25 federally 
recognized Indian Tribes who may 
ascribe religious and cultural 
significance to historic properties that 
may be affected by the undertaking to 
participate in the Section 106 
consultation and preparation of this PA. 
The NRC staff also invited Powertech, in 
accordance with 36 CFR 800.2(c)(4), via 
letter dated January 24, 2025. 
Additionally, in response to the NDN 
Collective’s request dated March 14, 
2025, the NRC invited the NDN 
Collective to participate as a consulting 
party in the Section 106 process for the 
undertaking. 
The NRC staff continued its efforts to 
engage in consultation with Tribes by 
sending emails and holding meetings to 
gather information related to

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159595 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Notices identification efforts and coordinate 
meetings. On March 5 and 13, 2025, the 
NRC staff held closed government-to- 
government virtual tribal information 
meetings. The purpose of the meetings 
was to engage with and hear from Tribal 
representatives invited to participate in 
and consult on the Section 106 process. 
On May 2, 2025, the NRC staff invited 
the Tribes to participate in a visit to the 
Dewey-Burdock ISR site. On June 11, 
2025, the NRC staff held a Tribal site 
visit as part of its ongoing Section 106 
consultation. The purpose of the Tribal 
site visit was to provide federally- 
recognized Tribes (i) an overview of the 
site and proposed ISR facilities, (ii) an 
overview of the area of potential effects, 
(iii) an overview of the areas where 
cultural resources have been identified 
in relation to potential surface 
disturbances, and (iv) answer questions 
from and gather information from Tribes 
about sites of religious and cultural 
significance to them and potential 
effects on these from the undertaking. 
By letter dated September 30, 2025, 
the NRC staff transmitted the draft PA, 
developed in accordance with 36 CFR 
800.14(b)(3), to the Tribes, BLM, EPA, 
ACHP, SD SHPO, and Powertech for 
review and comment. In the letter, the 
NRC staff also proposed coordinating a 
Tribal Cultural Resource Survey to be 
conducted after execution of the new 
PA using the draft survey methodology 
included as Appendix D of the draft PA. 
The NRC staff also requested comments 
on the draft tribal survey methodology. 
On November 19, 2025, the NRC staff 
transmitted the draft PA and draft tribal 
survey methodology to NDN Collective 
for review and comment. 
The NRC staff has updated the draft 
PA and draft tribal survey methodology 
based on the comments received. The 
NRC is requesting public comment on 
the updated draft PA. The NRC will 
consider these comments before 
finalizing the PA. The draft PA is 
available in ADAMS under Accession 
Nos. ML25346A149, ML25346A151, 
and ML25346A150.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Discussion 
Notice is hereby given that the NRC 
has issued Renewed Facility Operating 
License No. NPF–62 to Constellation for 
Clinton. Constellation is the operator of 
the facility. Renewed Facility Operating 
License No. NPF–62 authorizes 
Constellation to operate Clinton at 
reactor core power levels not in excess 
of 3,473 megawatts thermal, in 
accordance with the provisions of the 
Clinton renewed facility operating 
license and the technical specifications. 
Notice is also given that the ROD that 
supports the NRC’s decision to issue 
Renewed Facility Operating License No. 
NPF–62 is available, and its location is 
listed in the ‘‘Availability of 
Documents’’ section of this document. 
As discussed in the ROD and the final 
supplemental environmental impact 
statement (SEIS), published as NUREG– 
1437, Supplement 63, ‘‘Generic 
Environmental Impact Statement for 
License Renewal of Nuclear Plants 
Regarding License Renewal for Clinton 
Power Station, Unit 1, Final Report,’’ 
dated August 2025, the final SEIS 
documents the NRC staff’s 
environmental review, including the 
recommendation that the adverse 
environmental impacts of license 
renewal (LR) for Clinton are not so great 
that preserving the option of LR for 
energy-planning decisionmakers would 
be unreasonable. This recommendation 
is based on (1) the analysis and findings 
in the NRC’s Generic Environmental 
Impact Statement for License Renewal 
of Nuclear Plants, (2) information 
provided in the environmental report 
submitted by Constellation, as 
supplemented, (3) the NRC staff’s 
consultation with Federal, State, Tribal, 
and local agencies, (4) the NRC staff’s 
independent environmental review, and 
(5) the NRC staff’s consideration of 
public comments received during the 
scoping process and on the draft SEIS. 
Clinton is a boiling water reactor 
located on Clinton Lake in DeWitt 
County, approximately 6 miles east of 
the city of Clinton in east-central 
Illinois. Constellation submitted its 
application for the renewed license, 
‘‘Clinton Power Station, Unit 1 
Application for Renewed Operating 
License,’’ on February 14, 2024, as 
supplemented by letters through April 
10, 2025 (see ‘‘Availability of 
Documents’’ section of this document). 
The NRC staff has detemined that 
Constellation’s application complies 
with the standards and requirements of 
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended (the Act), and the NRC’s 
regulations. As required by the Act and 
NRC regulations in title 10 of the Code 
of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), the 
NRC has made appropriate findings, 
which are set forth in the renewed 
license. 
A public notice of the NRC’s 
acceptance for docketing of the LR 
application and an opportunity to 
request a hearing was published in the 
Federal Register on April 18, 2024 (89 
FR 27805). 
For further details with respect to this 
action, see: (1) Constellation’s LR 
application for Clinton, dated February 
14, 2024, as supplemented by letters 
through April 10, 2025; (2) the NRC’s 
safety evaluation, dated August 2025; 
(3) the NRC’s final SEIS, dated August 
2025; and (4) the NRC’s ROD, dated 
December 16, 2025.

Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed 
Rule Change To Adopt ISE Options 9, 
Section 25 To Codify an Options 
Unbundling Rule 
December 16, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
11, 2025, Nasdaq ISE, LLC (‘‘ISE’’ or 
‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’ or 
‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III, below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to adopt ISE 
Options 9, Section 25 to codify the 
Exchange’s longstanding guidance that 
the unbundling of orders for any 
purpose other than best execution is 
considered conduct inconsistent with 
just and equitable principles of trade. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/ise/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend ISE 
Options 9 by adding a new Section 25 
to codify its longstanding guidance that 
it shall be considered conduct 
inconsistent with just and equitable 
principles of trade for any member, 
member organization, or person 
associated with or employed by a 
member or member organization 
(collectively, ‘‘member’’ or ‘‘members’’) 
to split an order into multiple smaller 
orders for any purpose other than 
seeking the best execution of the entire 
order.
3
Members of the Exchange are not 
allowed to engage in conduct 
inconsistent with just and equitable 
principles of trade.
4
 
‘‘Unbundling,’’ also known as ‘‘trade 
shredding,’’ is the practice of breaking 
up an order into multiple smaller orders 
for some purpose other than the best 
execution of the order. The practice of 
unbundling has in the past been used 
for purposes such as improperly 
maximizing commissions and fees 
charged to customers, distorting trade 
data, or circumventing rules pertaining 
to maximum order size.
5
 
The Exchange believes that the 
unbundling of orders generally serves 
no purpose to the customer that entered 
the order and may cause unnecessary 
delays in the execution of that order. 
This belief has been reflected in the 
Exchange’s longstanding regulatory 
guidance to its members.
6
 
The impermissibility of unbundling is 
a well-established principle across the 
U.S. securities markets. Other options 
exchanges have anti-unbundling rules 
or rule interpretations that are similar to 
the rule being adopted by the 
Exchange.
7
Additionally, other 
exchanges have also issued regulatory 
guidance to their members warning 
them against the practice of 
unbundling.

17 CFR 240.19b–4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6) requires a self-regulatory organization to give 
the Commission written notice of its intent to file 
the proposed rule change at least five business days 
prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule 
change, or such shorter time as designated by the 
Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this 
requirement. 
13
17 CFR 200.30–3(a)(12). 
Industry Regulatory Authority 
(‘‘FINRA’’) also has its own anti- 
unbundling rule, FINRA Rule 5290, 
which specifies, in part, that ‘‘[n]o 
member . . . shall engage in conduct 
that has the intent or effect of splitting 
any order into multiple smaller orders 
for execution or any execution into 
multiple smaller executions for 
transaction reporting for the primary 
purpose of maximizing a monetary or 
in-kind amount to be received by the 
member . . . as a result of the execution 
of such orders or the transaction 
reporting of such executions.’’ 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
9
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
10
 
in particular, in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general to protect 
investors and the public interest, by 
deterring and helping to prevent the 
distortive practice of unbundling. 
The Exchange believes that the 
unbundling of orders generally serves 
no purpose to the customer that entered 
the order and may cause unnecessary 
delays in the execution of that order. 
Codifying its longstanding guidance in 
its rulebook that unbundling is conduct 
inconsistent with just and equitable 
principles of trade is thus designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade. Additionally, by defining 
unbundling as the practice of splitting 
an order into multiple smaller orders for 
any purpose other than seeking the best 
execution of the entire order, the 
proposal is designed to promote best 
execution and thus protect investors 
and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange reiterates 
that the proposed rule is substantively 
identical to NYSE American Rule 
995NY(d) and it is consistent with the 
rules and regulatory guidance of other 
exchanges, as well as FINRA Rule 5290. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. In terms of 
intra-market competition, the Exchange 
notes that the proposed rule will apply 
equally to all members of the Exchange. 
Additionally, in terms of intermarket 
competition, the Exchange notes that 
the proposed rule is consistent with the 
rules of other exchanges, as well as the 
rules of FINRA. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Nasdaq

Proceedings To Determine Whether To 
Approve or Disapprove a Proposed 
Rule Change To List and Trade Shares 
of the iShares Bitcoin Premium Income 
ETF Under Nasdaq Rule 5711(d) 
(Commodity Based Trust Shares) 
December 16, 2025. 
I. Introduction 
On September 30, 2025, The Nasdaq 
Stock Market LLC (‘‘Exchange’’) filed 
with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (‘‘Commission’’), pursuant 
to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (‘‘Act’’)
1
and Rule 
19b–4 thereunder,
2
a proposed rule 
change to list and trade shares 
(‘‘Shares’’) of the iShares Bitcoin 
Premium Income ETF (‘‘Trust’’) under 
Nasdaq Rule 5711(d) (Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares). The proposed rule change 
was published for comment in the 
Federal Register on October 2, 2025.
3
 
On November 3, 2025, pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
4
the 
Commission designated a longer period 
within which to approve the proposed 
rule change, disapprove the proposed 
rule change, or institute proceedings to 
determine whether to disapprove the 
proposed rule change.
5
This order 
institutes proceedings under Section 
19(b)(2)(B) of the Act
6
to determine 
whether to approve or disapprove the 
proposed rule change. 
II. Summary of the Proposal 
As described in more detail in the 
Notice,
7
the Exchange proposes to list 
and trade the Shares of the Trust under 
Nasdaq Rule 5711(d), which governs the 
listing and trading of Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares on the Exchange. 
According to the Exchange, the 
investment objective of the Trust is to 
reflect generally the performance of the 
price of bitcoin while providing income 
by writing (selling) call options 
primarily on iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF 
(‘‘IBIT’’) or indices that track spot 
exchange-traded products (‘‘ETPs’’).
8
 
The Trust will be actively-managed and 
will invest primarily in spot bitcoin and 
IBIT, will hold cash, and will write 
options on IBIT or indices tracking spot 
bitcoin ETPs.
9
Such options may consist 
of U.S. exchange-listed options, flexible 
exchange options, or over-the-counter 
(‘‘OTC’’) options.
10
The Exchange states 
that it is submitting this proposal 
because the Trust will be actively 
managed and may hold OTC options 
that are not listed and traded on an 
Intermarket Surveillance Group market; 
however, it will meet all of the other 
requirements under the generic listing 
standards for Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares set forth in Nasdaq Rule 
5711(d).

flexibility to determine what type of proceeding— 
either oral or notice and opportunity for written 
comments—is appropriate for consideration of a 
particular proposal by a self-regulatory 
organization. See Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing & Urban

III. Proceedings To Determine Whether 
To Approve or Disapprove SR– 
NASDAQ–2025–085 and Grounds for 
Disapproval Under Consideration 
The Commission is instituting 
proceedings pursuant to Section 
19(b)(2)(B) of the Act
12
to determine 
whether the proposed rule change 
should be approved or disapproved. 
Institution of proceedings is appropriate 
at this time in view of the legal and 
policy issues raised by the proposed 
rule change. Institution of proceedings 
does not indicate that the Commission 
has reached any conclusions with 
respect to any of the issues involved. 
Rather, the Commission seeks and 
encourages interested persons to 
provide comments on the proposed rule 
change. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the 
Act,
13
the Commission is providing 
notice of the grounds for disapproval 
under consideration. The Commission is 
instituting proceedings to allow for 
additional analysis of the proposed rule 
change’s consistency with Section 
6(b)(5) of the Act, which requires, 
among other things, that the rules of a 
national securities exchange be 
‘‘designed to prevent fraudulent and 
manipulative acts and practices’’ and 
‘‘to protect investors and the public 
interest.’’
14
 
The Commission asks that 
commenters address the sufficiency of 
the Exchange’s statements in support of 
the proposal, which are set forth in the 
Notice, in addition to any other 
comments they may wish to submit 
about the proposed rule change. In 
particular, the Commission seeks 
comment on whether the proposal to list 
and trade Shares of the Trust, which 
would be actively managed and would 
write OTC options on IBIT or indices 
tracking spot bitcoin ETPs, is designed 
to prevent fraudulent and manipulative 
acts and practices or raises any new or 
novel concerns not previously 
contemplated by the Commission. 
IV. Procedure: Request for Written 
Comments 
The Commission requests that 
interested persons provide written 
submissions of their views, data, and 
arguments with respect to the issues 
identified above, as well as any other 
concerns they may have with the 
proposal. In particular, the Commission 
invites the written views of interested 
persons concerning whether the 
proposal is consistent with Section 
6(b)(5) or any other provision of the Act, 
and the rules and regulations 
thereunder. Although there do not 
appear to be any issues relevant to 
approval or disapproval that would be 
facilitated by an oral presentation of 
views, data, and arguments, the 
Commission will consider, pursuant to 
Rule 19b–4, any request for an 
opportunity to make an oral 
presentation.
15
 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views, and 
arguments regarding whether the 
proposed rule change should be 
approved or disapproved by January 9, 
2026. Any person who wishes to file a 
rebuttal to any other person’s 
submission must file that rebuttal by 
January 23, 2026.

and discussed any comments it received 
on the proposed rule change. The text 
of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. 
The Exchange has prepared summaries, 
set forth in sections A, B, and C below, 
of the most significant parts of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend the 
Trust, shares of which currently list and 
trade on the Exchange pursuant to Rule 
8.201–E (Non-Generic),
4
to list and trade 
on the Exchange pursuant to Rule 
8.201–E (Generic). 
The shares of the Trust (‘‘Shares’’) 
will meet the requirements of Rule 
8.201–E (Generic) and will be required 
to comply with the continued listing 
requirements set forth in such Rule. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the Act 
and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b)
5
of the Act. Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5)
6
requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged 
in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, 
and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is designed to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and, in general, to protect investors and 
the public interest because it would 
provide for the transition of the Trust 
from being listed under Rule 8.201–E 
(Non-Generic) to Rule 8.201–E (Generic) 
instead. The proposed change would 
allow the Shares to continue listing and 
trading on the Exchange and permit the 
Trust to operate in reliance on the 
generic listing standards in Rule 8.201– 
E (Generic) instead of the terms of the 
Original Approval Order, thereby 
facilitating the continued listing and 
trading of exchange-traded products that 
will enhance competition among market 
participants, to the benefit of investors 
and the marketplace. The Shares will 
meet the requirements of Rule 8.201–E 
(Generic) and will be required to 
comply with the continued listing 
standards set forth in Rule 8.201–E 
(Generic). 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purpose of the Act. As discussed 
above, the proposed change is intended 
to facilitate the continued listing and 
trading of the Shares on the Exchange, 
thereby promoting competition among 
exchange-traded products to the benefit 
of investors and the marketplace. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received from 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were solicited 
or received with respect to the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The Exchange has filed the proposed 
rule change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act
7
and Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6)
8
thereunder. Because the 
foregoing proposed rule change does 
not: (i) significantly affect the protection 
of investors or the public interest; (ii) 
impose any significant burden on 
competition; or (iii) become operative 
for 30 days from the date on which it 
was filed, or such shorter time as the 
Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act
9
and Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6)
10
thereunder. 
A proposed rule change filed under 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
11
normally does not 
become operative prior to 30 days after 
the date of the filing. However, pursuant 
to Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii),
12
the 
Commission may designate a shorter 
time if such action is consistent with 
protection of investors and the public 
interest. The Exchange has asked the 
Commission to waive the 30-day 
operative delay so that the proposed 
rule change may become effective and 
operative immediately upon filing. The 
Commission believes that waiving the 
30-day operative delay is consistent 
with the protection of investors and the 
public interest because it will allow the 
Exchange to promptly transition the 
Shares to list and trade under Rule 
8.201–E (Generic), thereby providing for 
the continued listing and trading of the 
Shares on the Exchange without delay 
and does not introduce any novel 
regulatory issues. Accordingly, the 
Commission designates the proposed 
rule change to be operative upon 
filing.

At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Cboe

Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed 
Rule Change To Introduce a Historical 
Trade-by-Trade Report 
December 16, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’)
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
11, 2025, Cboe Exchange, Inc. (the 
‘‘Exchange’’ or ‘‘Cboe Options’’) filed 
with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ‘‘Commission’’) the 
proposed rule change as described in 
Items I, II, and III below, which Items 
have been prepared by the Exchange. 
The Exchange filed the proposal as a 
‘‘non-controversial’’ proposed rule 
change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
3
and Rule 
19b–4(f)(6) thereunder.

The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
Cboe Exchange, Inc. (the ‘‘Exchange’’ 
or ‘‘Cboe Options’’) proposes to 
introduce a Trade-by-Trade report. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is also available on the Commission’s 
website (https://www.sec.gov/rules/ 
sro.shtml), the Exchange’s website 
(https://www.cboe.com/us/options/ 
regulation/rule_filings/bzx/), and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to introduce a 
Trade-by-Trade report (‘‘TBT Report’’), 
which will be available for purchase to 
Cboe Trading Permit Holders (‘‘TPHs’’) 
and non-TPHs.
5
The TBT Report will 
provide subscribers with comprehensive 
trade-by-trade level detail for each 
options transaction executed on the 
Exchange. The TBT Report will be 
produced and updated at the end of 
each trading day and be made available 
to subscribers overnight after midnight 
Eastern Time (i.e., T+1), ensuring that the data is strictly historical and cannot 
be used to influence intraday trading 
decisions.
6
 
Specifically, each row in the TBT 
Report will represent a single trade 
event and will include transaction time, 
trading floor timestamp, underlying 
symbol, Options Symbology Initiative 
(‘‘OSI’’) details (e.g., root, expiry, strike, call/put), trade size, trade price, market 
context indicators (e.g., National Best Bid/National Best Offer, local Best Bid/ 
Best Offer), side of the market (i.e., buy or sell), transaction type (opening or 
closing), and origin (i.e., customer, professional customer, broker-dealer, 
and market maker), as well as the 
subscribing Member’s execution IDs for 
both Simple Book
7
and Complex Order 
Book
8
trades that will better allow for 
accurate linkage and reconstruction of 
trading activity. 
The Exchange anticipates a wide 
variety of market participants would 
purchase the TBT Report, including, but 
not limited to, individual customers, 
buy-side investors, and investment 
banks. The Exchange believes the 
proposed TBT Report will aid 
subscribers in performing detailed 
transaction-level analysis, compliance 
checks, and historical market 
reconstruction. The TBT Report may 
also serve as a foundation for analytics 
on liquidity, price formation, and trade 
behavior at a trade-by-trade level. The 
proposed TBT Report is a completely 
voluntary product, in that the Exchange 
is not required by any rule or regulation 
to make this data available and that 
potential subscribers may purchase it 
only if they voluntarily choose to do so 
and are not required to purchase the 
TBT Report. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’) and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
9
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5)
10
requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged 
in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, 
and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and

For example, subscribers to the intraday 
product receive the first calculation of intraday data 
by approximately 9:42 a.m. ET, which represents 
data captured from 9:30 a.m. to 9:40 a.m. 
Subscribers receive the next update at 9:52 a.m., 
representing the data previously provided together 
with data captured from 9:40 a.m. through 9:50 
a.m., and so forth. Each update represents the 
aggregate data captured from the current 
‘‘snapshot’’ and all previous ‘‘snapshots.’’

cumulative data for a particular trading session for 
a particular option series. Both reports include 
information regarding the aggregate number of 
trades to open a position, aggregate number of 
trades to close a position, and the origin of the 
trades based on the specific categories of market 
participants (i.e., customers, broker-dealers, market makers, etc.). See Nasdaq PHLX Options—Trade Outline (PHOTO) Intraday, available at: https://

Id. 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
11
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
In adopting Regulation NMS, the 
Commission granted self-regulatory 
organizations (‘‘SROs’’) and broker- 
dealers increased authority and 
flexibility to offer new and unique 
market data to the public. It was 
believed that this authority would 
expand the amount of data available to 
consumers, and also spur innovation 
and competition for the provision of 
market data. The Exchange believes that 
the proposed TBT Report would further 
broaden the availability of U.S. option 
market data to investors consistent with 
the principles of Regulation NMS. The 
proposal also promotes increased 
transparency through the dissemination 
of the TBT Report. The proposed rule 
change would benefit investors by 
providing access to the TBT Report, 
which as noted above, may aid 
subscribers in performing detailed 
transaction-level analysis, compliance 
checks, and historical market 
reconstruction. The TBT Report may 
also serve as a foundation for analytics 
on liquidity, price formation, and trade 
behavior at a trade-by-trade level. 
Additionally, trade-by-trade information 
regarding opening and closing activity 
across different option series may 
indicate investor sentiment, which can 
be helpful trading information. 
Notably, the Exchange notes that it 
previously submitted a filing for a 
similar data product, the Intraday Open- 
Close Data, which was immediately 
effective upon filing.
12
By way of 
background, the Intraday Open-Close 
Data provides summary level data of 
trading activity on the Exchange at the 
option level by origin (customer, 
professional customer, broker-dealer, 
and market maker), side of the market 
(buy or sell), and transaction type 
(opening or closing). The customer and 
professional customer volume are 
further broken down into trade size 
buckets (less than 100 contracts, 100– 
199 contracts, greater than 199 
contracts). The Intraday Open-Close 
Data is proprietary Exchange trade data 
and does not include trade data from 
any other exchange. The Intraday Open- 
Close Data is offered in two different 
intervals, where options transaction 
data is captured in snapshots taken 
either every 1-minute interval or 10- 
minute interval during the trading day. 
This data is then made available to 
subscribers within 5-minutes of the 
conclusion of the 1-minute or 10-minute 
interval period. 
13
 
Importantly, given the TBT Report’s 
similarities to the Intraday Open-Close 
Data, the Exchange believes that this 
proposal does not present any new or 
novel issues. In terms of utility, the 
Exchange believes that the proposed 
TBT Report is very similar in nature to 
the Intraday Open-Close Data. While 
there are some differences between the 
Intraday Open-Close Data and the TBT 
Report (e.g., timing of delivery) the utility of these reports is substantially 
similar. Specifically, the TBT Report 
and the Intraday Open-Close Data both 
provide information regarding options 
trading activity on the Exchange, which 
in turn, may be used by subscribers to 
create and test trading models and 
analytical strategies, and provide 
comprehensive insight into trading on 
the Exchange. The functional difference 
is merely the level of granularity a 
subscriber may desire to view executed 
options transactions and the timeline on 
which each product is delivered—i.e., 
on a per symbol aggregated level in 1- 
minute or 10-minute intervals and 
delivered intraday on a delayed basis 
(Intraday Open Close Data), or as 
proposed, on a trade-by-trade level that 
is delivered on a T+1 basis (the 
proposed TBT Report). Importantly, by 
offering the TBT Report as well as the 
Intraday Open-Close Data, subscribers 
will have an additional option for 
historical trade data and may choose to 
purchase the data that best suits their 
business needs. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will result in 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. Specifically, 
the Exchange notes that both NASDAQ 
OMX PHLX (‘‘PHLX’’) and the NASDAQ 
Stock Market (‘‘NASDAQ’’) offer PHLX 
Options Trade Outline (‘‘PHOTO’’)
14
 
and NASDAQ Options Trade Outline 
(‘‘NOTO’’),
15
respectively, which 
compete with the Exchange’s Intraday 
Open-Close Data. In this regard, the 
Exchange believes that its proposal will 
promote competition by permitting the 
Exchange to offer a data product similar 
to those offered by other competitor 
options exchanges but that also contains 
more granular data reporting details on 
a trade-by-trade basis, rather than on an 
aggregated basis. 
Furthermore, the Exchange believes 
the proposed TBT Report is an iteration 
of the Intraday Open-Close Data, as well 
as PHOTO and NOTO, and as such, 
represents the type of innovation and 
competition that Reg NMS sought to 
create. In this regard, the Exchange is 
proposing to introduce the TBT Report 
in order to keep pace with changes in 
the industry and evolving customer 
needs, and believes this proposed rule 
change would contribute to robust 
competition among national securities 
exchanges, by meeting the needs of such 
customers. The Exchange has received 
feedback from customers that more 
granular, trade-by-trade data would be 
helpful to review. 
As a result, the Exchange believes this 
proposed rule change permits fair 
competition among national securities 
exchanges. Therefore, the Exchange 
does not believe the proposed rule 
change will result in any burden on 
competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. Furthermore, this 
product offering is entirely optional and 
is available to anyone who believes this 
data will be helpful for their purposes. 
As such, the Exchange does not believe 
this proposed rule change places a 
burden on intramarket competition. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received comments on the proposed 
rule change.

2025–35] 
Self-Regulatory Organizations; 
Investors Exchange LLC; Notice of 
Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of 
Proposed Rule Change To Modify the 
Handling of Incoming Post Only 
Orders 
December 16, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1)
1
of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’)
2
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
3
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
8, 2025, the Investors Exchange LLC 
(‘‘IEX’’ or the ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II and III 
below, which Items have been prepared 
by the self-regulatory organization. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 
19(b)(1) under the Act
4
, and Rule 19b– 
4 thereunder,
5
the Exchange is filing 
with the Commission a proposed rule 
change to modify IEX Rule 11.190(b)(20) 
to modify the handling of Post Only 
orders that at time of entry would lock 
or cross a Protected Quotation
6
of an 
external market. The Exchange has 
designated this proposed rule change as 
‘‘non-controversial’’ under Section 
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act
7
and provided the 
Commission with the notice required by 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6) thereunder.

The text of the proposed rule change 
is available at the Exchange’s website at 
https://www.iexexchange.io/resources/ 
regulation/rule-filings and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
self-regulatory organization included 
statements concerning the purpose of 
and basis for the proposed rule change 
and discussed any comments it received 
on the proposed rule change. The text 
of these statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. 
The self-regulatory organization has 
prepared summaries, set forth in 
Sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant aspects of such statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend IEX 
Rule 11.190(b)(20) to provide that a Post 
Only order that at time of entry would 
lock or cross a Protected Quotation of an 
external market will be re-priced by the 
System
9
before booking, in a manner 
consistent with the functionality of 
other exchanges that offer similar order 
types. 
IEX defines a Post Only order as a 
displayed, non-routable order that will 
not remove liquidity from the IEX Order 
Book
10
except in certain 
circumstances.
11
Specifically, an order 
with a Post Only instruction will only 
remove liquidity if it is an order to trade 
a security priced below $1.00,
12
or if it 
would receive price improvement (as 
measured against the less aggressive of 
the order’s limit price or the contra-side 
Protected Quotation) of at least $0.01.
13
 
If neither of the conditions in the 
preceding paragraph are met, the 
incoming Post Only order will post to 
the Order Book, unless there is a non- 
displayed order with a Trade Now 
instruction
14
that locks the price of the 
incoming Post Only order, in which 
case the resting order will ‘‘be converted 
to an executable order that removes 
liquidity against such incoming 
order.’’
15
In that circumstance, the Post 
Only order would execute as a 
displayed liquidity adding order 
without having actually posted to the 
Order Book. All non-displayed limit 
orders (limit,
16
reserve,
17
and D-Limit
18
 
orders) automatically include a Trade 
Now instruction, and certain non- 
displayed pegged orders (Midpoint,
19
 
Offset,
20
Market,
21
and Fixed 
Midpoint
22
Peg) may include a Trade 
Now instruction if selected by the User. 
Post Only orders that were not 
designated by the User to cancel are also 
subject to display-price sliding,
23
so that 
a Post Only order that would lock or 
cross a Protected Quotation of an 
external market will be ranked and 
displayed by the System at one (1) 
minimum price variant (‘‘MPV’’)
24
 
below the current NBO
25
(for bids) or 
one (1) MPV above the current NBB
26
 
(for offers). For example, under IEX’s 
current rules, if the NBBO for a security 
is $10.10 × $10.20, and IEX does not have any resting interest to sell at 
$10.20, an incoming Post Only order to 
buy with a limit price of $10.20 would 
be re-priced and rest on the Order Book 
at $10.19 (one MPV below the NBO). 
However, if in the above example IEX 
had a non-displayed order to sell at 
$10.20 with a Trade Now instruction 
resting on its Order Book, the incoming 
Post Only order would execute against 
the resting non-displayed order rather 
than re-price and post to the Order 
Book. 
Based on informal feedback, IEX 
understands that Members who submit 
Post Only orders are typically 
employing a trading strategy that is 
contingent on them being able to be the 
provider of displayed liquidity. 
Consequently, they have expressed a 
preference that orders with a Post Only 
modifier remove liquidity as 
infrequently as possible (e.g., the order described above would re-price or 
cancel if it would lock the Protected 
Quotation of any external market). 
Based on this feedback, IEX is now 
proposing to change its Post Only rule 
in a manner consistent with Members’ 
preferences that will continue to 
incentive Members to provide displayed 
liquidity to the market and thereby 
contribute to public price discovery in 
a manner that is consistent with the Act. 
Specifically, IEX proposes to amend 
IEX Rule 11.190(b)(20) by adding a new 
subparagraph (C) which will read in 
full: 
If not designated by the User to cancel, a 
Post Only order that, at time of entry, would 
lock or cross a Protected Quotation of an 
external market will be ranked and displayed 
by the System at one (1) MPV below the 
current NBO (for bids) or one (1) MPV above 
the current NBB (for offers).
27
 
Under this proposed rule change, Post 
Only orders will continue to execute on

See Nasdaq Equity 4, Rule 4702(b)(4)(A). 29
See NYSE Rule 7.31(e)(2)(B)(ii). NYSE would re-price the ‘‘display price’’ but not the ‘‘working 
price’’ which in this context is analogous to how 
IEX will retain the order’s limit price even after it 
is re-priced.

entry as the liquidity adding order if 
they lock a resting non-displayed order 
with a Trade Now instruction so long as 
the Post Only order does not also lock 
a Protected Quotation of an external 
market. Applying this rule change to the 
above example, if the NBBO for a 
security is $10.10 × $10.20, an incoming Post Only order to buy with a limit price 
of $10.20 that would lock the Protected 
Quotation of an external market would 
be re-priced to $10.19 (unless 
designated to cancel). However, if IEX 
also had a non-displayed order to sell at 
$10.19 with a Trade Now instruction 
resting on its Order Book, the incoming 
Post Only order would execute against 
the resting non-displayed order at 
$10.19 and not post to the Order Book. 
IEX also proposes to renumber the 
current subparagraphs (C)–(F) of IEX 
Rule 11.190(b)(20) to be subparagraphs 
(D)–(G). 
IEX also notes that this proposed 
change to Post Only order functionality 
is consistent with how similar order 
types are handled by other exchanges. 
For example, the Nasdaq Stock Market 
LLC (‘‘Nasdaq’’), handles incoming post 
only orders that would lock or cross a 
Protected Quotation in the same manner 
as IEX now proposes to handle them; 
specifically, it would either cancel or re- 
price (depending on the order’s 
instructions) the order to one MPV 
lower (higher) than the NBO (NBB) for 
bids (offers).
28
And the New York Stock 
Exchange (‘‘NYSE’’), would either 
cancel or re-price (depending on the 
order’s instructions) an incoming post 
only orders (called an ‘‘ALO Order’’) 
that would lock or cross a Protected 
Quotation to a price that is one MPV 
lower (higher) than the NBO (NBB) for 
bids (offers).
29
 
Implementation 
The Exchange will announce the 
implementation date of the proposed 
changes by Trader Alert at least ten days 
in advance of such implementation date 
and within 90 days of effectiveness of 
this proposed rule change. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
Section 6(b) of the Act,
30
in general, and 
furthers the objectives of Section 
6(b)(5),
31
in particular, in that it is 
designed to prevent fraudulent and 
manipulative acts and practices, to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to foster cooperation and 
coordination with persons engaged in 
facilitating transactions in securities, 
and to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Specifically, the Exchange believes 
that the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the public interest and 
protection of investors as it would better 
align IEX’s Post Only order type 
handling with Members’ preferences in 
a manner that will encourage Members 
to submit more Post Only orders to the 
exchange, thereby removing 
impediments to and perfecting the 
mechanism of a free and open market. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes 
that the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest, 
because it is designed to encourage 
Members to add displayed liquidity on 
the Exchange. As discussed above, this 
proposed rule change would better align 
IEX’s Post Only order functionality with 
the expectations and trading strategies 
of IEX’s Members seeking to add 
liquidity to the Exchange. This in turn 
is designed to encourage the posting of 
more displayed liquidity on the 
Exchange, and to the extent that such an 
incentive is successful in increasing the 
overall liquidity pool available at IEX, 
all market participants, including takers 
of liquidity, will benefit. Thus, IEX 
believes this proposal supports the 
purposes of the Act to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest. 
In addition, as noted in the Purpose 
section, this proposed rule change 
would align IEX’s Post Only order 
functionality with that of Nasdaq and 
NYSE.
32
Thus, IEX does not believe that 
the proposed change raises any new or 
novel material issues that have not 
already been considered by the 
Commission in connection with existing 
order types offered by other national 
securities exchanges, which supports 
the purposes of the Act to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on intermarket competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
To the contrary, the proposal is 
designed to enhance IEX’s 
competitiveness with other markets by 
further incentivizing the posting of 
displayed liquidity on the Exchange. As 
noted above, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change would generally 
align order handling on IEX with 
trading functionality on other equity 
exchanges and thus would promote 
competition among exchanges by 
offering Members similar functionality 
and order handling to those available on 
other exchanges. The Exchange also 
believes that, to the extent the proposed 
change would increase opportunities for 
the posting of displayed orders to IEX’s 
Order Book, the proposed change would 
promote competition by making the 
Exchange a more attractive venue for 
order flow and enhance market quality 
for all market participants. Moreover, 
competing exchanges have adopted and 
can continue to adopt the same 
functionality contained in this proposal, 
subject to the SEC rule change process, 
as discussed in the Purpose section. 
The Exchange also does not believe 
that the proposed rule change will 
impose any burden on intramarket 
competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. All Members are 
eligible to submit Post Only orders. 
Moreover, the proposal would provide 
potential benefits to all Members to the 
extent that allowing Post Only orders 
incentivizes the provision of more 
displayed liquidity on IEX. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s

Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
Written comments were neither 
solicited nor received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the

The Exchange initially submitted the proposed 
rule change on August 30, 2024 and was effective 
September 3, 2024 (SR–CboeBZX–2024–082). On 
September 13, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that 
filing and submitted SR–CboeBZX–2024–088. On 
November 12, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that 
filing and submitted SR–CboeBZX–2024–113. On 
December 20, 2024, the Exchange withdrew that 
filing and submitted SR–CboeBZX–2024–131. On 
February 3, 2025, the Exchange withdrew that filing 
and submitted SR–CboeBZX–2025–016. On April 4, 
the Exchange withdrew that filing and submitted 
SR–Cboe–BZX–2025–052. On June 2, 2025, the 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
34
thereunder. Because 
the proposed rule change does not: (i) 
significantly affect the protection of 
investors or the public interest; (ii) 
impose any significant burden on 
competition; and (iii) become operative 
for 30 days from the date on which it 
was filed, or such shorter time as the 
Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6) thereunder. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change meets the criteria 
of subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b–4
35
 
because it would not significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest. Rather, the proposed rule 
change neither significantly affects the 
protection of investors or the public 
interest, nor does it impose any burden 
on competition because it would merely 
adjust the functionality of Post Only 
orders so that it better aligns with the 
functionality with how Post Only orders 
work on other exchanges such as 
Nasdaq and NYSE, as discussed in the 
Purpose and Statutory Basis sections, 
and does not raise any new or novel 
material issues that have not already 
been considered by the Commission. 
Accordingly, IEX has designated this 
rule filing as non-controversial under 
Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act
36
and 
paragraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b–4 
thereunder.
37
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
under Section 19(b)(2)(B)
38
of the Act to 
determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments

The terms ‘‘Trading System’’ and ‘‘System’’ 
mean the automated trading system used by BZX 
Options for the trading of options contracts. See 
Chapter XVI. General Provisions—BZX Options, 
Rule 16.1 Definitions. 
5
See Exchange Rule 21.1 (l)(2), definition of ‘‘logical port.’’ Logical ports include FIX and BOE 
ports (used for order entry), drop logical port 
(which grants users the ability to receive and/or 
send drop copies) and ports that are used for receipt 
of certain market data feeds. 
6
The term ‘‘Logical Ports’’ used herein shall refer 
to FIX and BOE ports (used for order entry). See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule, Options Logical 
Port Fees, ‘‘Logical Ports’’ (which exclude Purge 
Port, Multicast PITCH Spin Server Port or GRP 
Port). 
7
Purge Ports provide users the ability to cancel 
a subset (or all) of open orders across Executing 
Firm ID(s) (‘‘EFID(s)’’), Underlying symbol(s), or 
CustomGroupID(s), across multiple logical ports/ 
sessions. See Securities Exchange Act Release 79956 (February 3, 2017), 82 FR 10102 (February 9, 
2017) (SR–BatsBZX–2017–05). See also https://cdn.

ability to submit and update multiple quote bids 
and offers in one message through logical ports 
enabled for bulk-quoting.

A matching engine is a part of the Exchange’s 
System that processes options quotes and trades on 
a symbol-by-symbol basis. Some matching engines 
will process option classes with multiple root 
symbols, and other matching engines will be 
dedicated to one single option root symbol (for 
example, options on SPY will be processed by one 
single matching engine that is dedicated only to 
SPY). A particular root symbol may only be 
assigned to a single designated matching engine. A 
particular root symbol may not be assigned to 
multiple matching engines.

The Exchange notes for clarity that while 
BOEv2 has been decommissioned, Members can 
still access the convenience layer through BOEv3 
protocol. 
11
See Securities Exchange Act Release 100582 (July 23, 2024), 89 FR 60958 (July 29, 2024) (SR–

The BOE protocol is a proprietary order entry 
protocol used by Members to connect to the 
Exchange. The current version is BOEv3.

14
The Exchange decommissioned BOEv2 in 
March 2025. 
15
The Exchange notes that this improved 
infrastructure improves the prior noted natural 
variance in the amount of time it takes individual 
order handlers to process messages of the same type 
for all Members due to the improved infrastructure, 
even if a participant chooses to not utilize Unitized 
Logical Ports.

Members will be able to purchase Unitized 
Logical Ports individually or may purchase a ‘‘set,’’ 
which will provide the total number of ports 
needed to connect to each available matching 
engine.

Similar to the Exchange’s preexisting Logical 
Ports, the new Unitized Logical Ports allow 
Members to submit orders and quotes. 
Unitized Port Fees 
By way of background, Exchange 
Members may interface with the 
Exchange’s Trading System
4
 
(hereinafter, ‘‘System’’) by utilizing 
either the Financial Information 
Exchange (‘‘FIX’’) protocol or the Binary 
Order Entry (‘‘BOE’’) protocol. The 
Exchange further offers a variety of 
logical ports,
5
which provide users of 
these ports with the ability within the 
Exchange’s System to accomplish a 
specific function through a connection, 
such as order entry, data receipt or 
access to information. For example, 
such ports include Logical Ports,
6
Purge 
Ports,
7
and Ports with Bulk Quoting 
Capabilities
8
(‘‘Bulk Ports’’). By way of 
further background, each of these ports 
corresponds to a single running order 
handler. Each order handler processes 
the messages it receives from these ports 
from the connected Members. This 
processing includes determining 
whether the message contains the 
required information to enter the 
System, whether the message 
parameters satisfy port-level (i.e., pre- trade) risk controls, and where to send 
that message within the System (i.e., to which matching engine.
9
) Once an order 
handler completes the processing of a 
message, it sends that message to the 
appropriate matching engine. 
Historically, all order handlers 
connect to all matching engines. That is, 
under the BOEv2 and FIX protocols,
10
 
Members were able to access all 
symbols from a single logical port since 
each port corresponds to a single order 
handler that conveniently connects to 
all matching engines (‘‘convenience 
layer’’). Although the Exchange 
configures the software and hardware 
for its order handlers in the same 
manner, there can be a natural variance 
in the amount of time it takes individual 
order handlers to process messages of 
the same type under this architecture. 
Factors that contribute to this 
differentiation in processing times 
include the availability of shared 
resources (such as memory), which is 
impacted by (among other things) then- 
current message rates, the number of 
active symbols (i.e., classes), and recent messages for a symbol. This natural 
differentiation in processing times 
inherently may cause some messages to 
be sent from an order handler to a 
matching engine ahead of other 
messages that the Exchange’s System 
may have received earlier on a different 
order handler. 
The Exchange recently implemented a 
new architecture and protocol which 
includes, among other things, a single 
gateway per matching engine (‘‘unitized 
layer’’), which renders the above- 
described natural variance of order 
handler processing irrelevant for 
Members that connect to the unitized 
order handler.
11
More specifically, 
effective August 19, 2024, the Exchange 
implemented this new unitized access 
architecture and a new version of its 
Binary Order Entry (BOE) protocol
12
 
(‘‘BOEv3’’), which also resulted in the 
adoption of new logical port types 
(‘‘Unitized Logical Ports’’), for which 
the Exchange is now seeking to establish 
fees.
13
Under the new unitized BOEv3 
architecture, a single BOEv3 order 
handler corresponds to a single 
matching engine and all message traffic 
(including FIX and BOEv3 convenience 
layer port traffic)
14
passes through this 
unitized BOEv3 order handler before 
reaching that order handler’s 
corresponding matching engine.
15
If a 
Member desires to access this unitized 
layer of the BOEv3 architecture, the 
Member would need to obtain a 
Unitized Logical Port for each 
corresponding matching engine(s) that 
process the symbol(s) that Member 
desires to trade.
16
 
BOEv3 Unitized Logical Ports provide 
an expedited processing path to a single 
matching engine over that of other 
inbound paths on a best-efforts basis. 
Under routine circumstances, the 
System will process pending purge 
messages from BOEv3 Unitized Logical 
Ports before processing other inbound 
paths. Exceptions to this approach exist 
with regard to various message traffic 
and rate controls that are incorporated 
into the BOEv3 architecture. To 
illustrate how BOEv3 processes inbound 
messages, consider the following 
simplified example: (1) process pending 
purge messages from BOEv3 Unitized 
Logical Ports; (2) process all other 
pending messages from BOEv3 Unitized 
Logical Ports; (3) process pending 
messages from convenience ports. 
As noted above, to access the BOEv3 
architecture a Member must obtain a 
Unitized Logical Port for each 
corresponding matching engine(s) that 
processes the symbol(s) the Member 
desires to trade. The three new port 
types that have been adopted are: (1) 
BOE Unitized Logical Ports,
17
(2) Bulk

Similar to the Exchange’s preexisting Bulk 
Ports, the new Bulk Unitized Logical Ports allow 
Members to submit and update multiple quote bids 
and offers in one message and are particularly 
useful for Members that provide quotations in many 
different options. 
19
Similar to the Exchange’s preexisting Purge 
Ports, the new Purge Unitized Logical Ports are 
dedicated logical ports that provide the ability to 
cancel/purge all open orders, or a subset thereof, 
across multiple logical ports through a single 
cancel/purge message. They also solely process 
purge messages and are designed to assist Members, 
including Market Makers, in the management of, 
and risk control over, their orders and quotes, 
particularly if the Member is dealing with a large 
number of options. 
20
The terms ‘‘Options Market-Maker’’ and 
‘‘Market-Maker’’ mean an Options Member 
registered with the Exchange for the purpose of 
making markets in options contracts traded on the 
Exchange and that is vested with the rights and 
responsibilities specified in Chapter XXII of these 
Rules. See Chapter XVI. General Provisions—BZX Options, Rule 16.1 Definitions. 
21
Market Makers may provide liquidity using 
either FIX, BOE convenience ports, BOE Unitized 
Logical Ports, or BOE Bulk Unitized sessions using 
either order or quote messages. Only the BOE Bulk 
Unitized sessions support the quote messages. BOE 
Bulk convenience sessions were not created due to 
lack of demand from MMs. 
22
The Exchange notes that it operates 32 separate 
matching units. 
23
For example, the Exchange currently assesses a 
monthly per port fee of $750 for Logical Ports and 
Purge Ports. It also assesses $1,500 per port month 
for the 1st and 2nd Bulk Ports and $2,500 for the 
3rd or more Bulk Ports. See Cboe BZX Options Fee Schedule, Options Logical Port Fees. 
24
The Exchange proposes to include this example 
in the Fee Schedule to provide further clarity as to 
the application of the proposed fees. 
25
See Securities Exchange Act Release 101212

The Exchange proposes to include this example 
in its Fee Schedule to provide clarity as to how 
Unitized Logical Port fees will be assessed. The 
Exchange further notes that in its prior filing (SR– 
CboeBZX–2025–016), it increased the cap to 30 and 
noted as such in its fee schedule; however, the 
Exchange will now include a clarifying update in 
its fee schedule to update the max tier amount from 
20 to 30 for consistency and clarity. 
Unitized Logical Ports,
18
and (3) Purge 
Unitized Logical Ports
19
(collectively, 
‘‘Unitized Logical Port’’). With the 
exception of Exchange Options Market 
Makers
20
(hereinafter, ‘‘Market 
Makers’’) who may only quote via a BOE 
Bulk Unitized Logical Port,
21
use of the 
unitized architecture and purchase of a 
Unitized Logical Port is completely 
voluntary, and Members (i.e., non- Market Makers) are not required, or 
under any regulatory obligation, to 
utilize them. 
The Exchange proposes to establish 
fees for the new Unitized Logical Ports, 
which can be purchased on an 
individual basis (i.e., capable of accessing a specified matching engine 
(‘‘Matching Unit’’))
22
and/or as a set 
(‘‘Unitized Logical Port Set’’) (i.e., will include the total number of ports 
needed to connect to each available 
Matching Unit). The proposed fees for 
Unitized Logical Ports purchased 
individually and as sets are as follows: 
BOE Unitized Logical Port ................................................. $350/port/month. 
Bulk Unitized Logical Port .................................................. $550/port/month. 
Purge Unitized Logical Port ............................................... $400/port/month. 
BOE Unitized Logical Port (Set) ........................................ $2,500/month for 1st and 2nd port set, $3,000/month for 3rd–14th port set, $3,500/ 
month for 15th–30th port set. 
Bulk Unitized Logical Port (Set) ......................................... $5,500/month for 1st and 2nd port set, $6,000/month for 3rd–14th port set, $6,500/ 
month for 15th–30th port set. 
Purge Unitized Logical Port (Set) ...................................... $2,500/month for 1st and 2nd port set, $3,000/month for 3rd–14th port set, $3,500/ 
month for 15th–30th port set. 
The proposed fees for Unitized 
Logical Port Sets are progressive. For 
example, if a User were to purchase 11 
BOE Unitized Logical Port Sets, it will 
be charged a total of $32,000 per month 
($2,500 * 2 + $3,000 * 9). As is the case 
today for existing logical ports, the 
monthly fees are assessed and applied 
in their entirety and are not prorated. 
The Exchange notes the current 
standard fees assessed for existing 
logical ports will remain applicable and 
unchanged,
23
and Members are still able 
to purchase and utilize such ports if 
they choose to do so. The proposed fees 
for Unitized Logical Port Sets will be 
assessed per set, per Port Type. As an 
example, if a Member requests three 
BOE Unitized Logical Port Sets, one 
Bulk Unitized Logical Port Set, and one 
Purge Unitized Logical Port Set, the firm 
would be charged $8,000 ($2,500 + 
$2,500 + $3,000) for the three BOE 
Unitized Logical Port Sets, $5,500 for 
the one Bulk Unitized Logical Port Set, 
and $2,500 for the one Purge Unitized 
Logical Port Set.
24
 
Since the Exchange has a finite 
amount of capacity, it also proposes to 
prescribe a maximum limit on the 
number of Unitized Logical Ports that 
may be purchased and used on a per 
Member, per Matching Unit basis. The 
purpose of establishing these limits is to 
manage the allotment of Unitized 
Logical Ports in a fair and reasonable 
manner while preventing the Exchange 
from being required to expend large 
amounts of resources in order to provide 
an unlimited capacity to its matching 
engines. The Exchange previously 
proposed to provide that the two 
structures (i.e., individual unitized ports or unitized port sets) can be combined 
for up to a maximum of 20 Unitized 
Logical Ports per Member, per Matching 
Unit, per type of Unitized Logical 
Port.
25
The Exchange noted at the time 
it adopted this maximum that it would 
continue monitoring interest by all 
Members and system capacity 
availability with the goal of increasing 
these limits to meet Members’ needs if 
and when the demand is there and/or 
the Exchange is able to accommodate 
such demand.
26
Since then, the 
Exchange has determined that it is able 
to accommodate an increased cap 
relative to current demand and available 
to the Exchange’s matching engine and 
order handler capacity. As such, the 
Exchange proposes to increase the 
maximum to 30 Unitized Logical Ports 
per Member, per Matching Unit, per 
port type. As an example, a Member 
may request 12 BOE Unitized Logical 
Port Sets and 18 individual BOE 
Unitized Logical Ports for Matching 
Unit 1, providing a total max of 30 BOE 
Unitized Logical Ports on Matching Unit 
1 specifically. This would result in 
having 30 BOE Unitized Logical Ports 
on Matching Unit 1 and 12 BOE 
Unitized Ports on all additional 
Matching Units as part of the 12 BOE 
Unitized Logical Port Sets requested. 
Additionally, a firm may request 30 
Bulk Unitized Logical Port Sets and 30 
Purge Unitized Logical Port Sets as 
those would constitute different port 
types.
27
The Exchange believes the 
proposed cap will be sufficient for the 
vast majority of Members, as the 
Exchange understands that at this time, 
no Member desires more than the 
current cap. The Exchange notes that it 
will continue to monitor interest in 
Unitized Logical Ports and system 
capacity availability with the goal of 
further increasing these limits to meet 
Members needs if and when the demand 
is there, and the Exchange is able to 
accommodate it. Additionally, Members

The Exchange notes that it does not support 
conversion of any one port type to another. 
Members and Market Makers would need to request 
new port and delete existing their port to transition 
from convenience ports to a Unitized Logical Port.

See MIAX Express Interface for Quoting and Trading Options, MEI Interface Specification, 
Section 1.2 (MEI Architecture) available at: MIAX_
Express_Interface_MEI_v2.10a.pdf (miaxglobal.com) which indicates firms can 
connect directly to one or more matching engines 
depending on which symbols they wish to trade 
and states ‘‘MIAX trading architecture is highly 
scalable and consists of multiple trade matching 
environments (clouds). Each cloud handles trading 
for all options for a set of underlying instruments’’ 
and provides that ‘‘Market Maker firms can connect 
to one or more pre-assigned servers on each cloud. 
This will require the firm to connect to more than 
one cloud in order to quote in all underlying 
instruments they are approved to make markets in’’ 
See also MIAX Emerald Options Order Management 
Using FIX Protocol, FIX Interface Specification, 
available at https://www.miaxglobal.com/sites/

gateway [that] conveniently routes orders to our 
trading engines through a common entry point to 
our trading platform.’’ See https://
www.miaxglobal.com/markets/us-options/miax-

The term ‘‘quote’’ refers to bids and offers 
submitted in bulk messages. A bulk message means 
a single electronic message a user submits with an 
M (Market-Maker) capacity to the Exchange in 
which the User may enter, modify, or cancel up to 
an Exchange-specified number of bids and offers. A 
User may submit a bulk message through a bulk 
port as set forth in Exchange Rule 21.1(j)(3). See 
Rule 16.1 (definition of bulk message). 
31
The Exchange proposes to include this example 
in the Fees Schedule to provide further clarity as 
to the application of the proposed fees. 
will still be able to utilize the existing 
logical port connectivity offerings with 
no maximum limit in addition to their 
Unitized Logical Port allocation.
28
As 
further discussed below, the Exchange’s 
pricing for these new Unitized Logical 
Ports are less than or comparable to 
similar offerings from other 
exchanges.
29
 
Average Daily Quotes and Average Daily 
Order Fees 
The Exchange also proposes to adopt 
Average Daily Order (‘‘ADO’’) and 
Average Daily Quote (‘‘ADQ’’) fees. 
‘‘ADO’’ represents the total number of 
orders for the month, divided by the 
number of trading days. ‘‘ADQ’’ 
represents the total number of quotes for 
the month, divided by the number of 
trading days. When measuring a 
Member’s ADO and ADQ, orders, 
quotes, cancel/replace modify orders, 
and quote updates which submit a bid 
or offer and do not include cancels, are 
included. Further, ADO and ADQ will 
include orders and quotes submitted by 
a Member from all logical port types 
(i.e., non-unitized logical ports and Unitized Logical Ports). Each Member 
may submit up to 2,000,000 average 
daily orders or up to 250,000,000 
average daily quotes per calendar month 
without incurring any ADO or ADQ 
fees. In the event that the average 
number of quotes per trading day during 
a calendar month submitted exceeds 
250,000,000, each incremental usage of 
up to 20,000 average daily quotes will 
incur an additional fee as set forth in the 
table below. Similarly, in the event that 
the average number of orders per trading 
day during a calendar month submitted 
exceeds 2,000,000, each incremental 
usage of up to 1,000 average daily orders 
will incur an additional ADO fee as set 
forth in the table below.
30
A Member’s 
ADO and ADQ will be aggregated 
together with any affiliated Member 
sharing at least 75% common 
ownership.

Tier 5 
>3,500,000 
ADO Fee Rate per 1,000 ADO .............................. $0.00 $1.00 $1.50 $2.00 $2.50 As an example, a Member that has 
510,000,000 ADQ would subsequently 
have 25,500 ‘‘ADQ increments’’ 
(510,000,000 ADQ/20,000 ADQ 
increments). While 12,500 of the 25,500 
ADQ increments are free within Tier 1, 
12,500 of the ADQ increments would be 
fee liable at $0.050 within Tier 2, while 
the remaining 500 ADQ increments 
would be fee liable at $.075 within Tier 
3, resulting in a total ADQ fee of 
$662.50 for that month.
31
 
The Exchange notes that market 
participants with incrementally higher 
ADO or ADQ are likely to require more 
of the Exchange’s Trading System 
resources, bandwidth, and capacity. In 
this regard, higher ADO or ADQ may, in 
turn, create System latency and 
potentially impact other Members’ 
ability to receive timelier executions. 
The proposed fee structure has multiple 
thresholds, and the proposed fees are 
incrementally greater at higher ADO and 
ADQ rates because the potential impact 
on Exchange Systems, bandwidth, and 
capacity becomes greater with increased 
ADO and ADQ rates. As noted above, 
the proposal contemplates that a 
Member would have to exceed the high 
ADO rate of 2,000,000 and a Member 
would have to exceed the high ADQ rate 
of 250,000,000 before that market 
participant would be charged a fee 
under the proposed respective tiers. The 
Exchange believes that it is in the 
interests of all Members and market 
participants who access the Exchange to 
not allow other market participants to 
strain System resources, but rather 
encourage efficient usage of network 
capacity. The Exchange also believes 
this proposal (and in particular the 
proposed incrementally higher fee 
amounts associated with higher ADO 
and ADQ) will help to moderate 
excessive order/quote and trade activity 
from Members that may require the 
Exchange to otherwise increase its 
storage capacity and will encourage 
such activity to be submitted in good 
faith for legitimate purposes. 
The Exchange also represents that the 
proposed fees are not intended to raise 
profits; rather, as noted above, it is 
intended to encourage efficient behavior 
so that market participants do not 
exhaust System resources. Moreover, 
the Exchange provides Members with 
daily reports, free of charge, which 
details their order and trade activity in 
order for those firms to be fully aware 
of all order and trade activity they (and 
their affiliates) are sending to the 
Exchange. This will allow Members to 
monitor their behavior and determine 
whether it is approaching any of the 
ADO or ADQ thresholds that trigger the 
proposed fees. 
Lastly, the Exchange notes that other 
exchanges have adopted various fee 
programs that assess incrementally 
higher fees to Members that have 
incrementally higher order and/or

2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’) and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
33
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5)
34
requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged 
in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, 
and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
35
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Exchange also believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
Section 6(b)(4)
36
of the Act, which 
requires that Exchange rules provide for 
the equitable allocation of reasonable 
dues, fees, and other charges among its 
Members and other persons using its 
facilities. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
fees are reasonable because Unitized 
Logical Ports provide a valuable service 
in that Unitized Logical Ports are 
intended to create a more consistent, 
and more deterministic experience for 
messages once received within the 
Exchange’s System under the recently 
adopted unitized BOEv3 architecture. 
As discussed above, the new 
architecture (and thereby the new 
Unitized Logical Ports) was designed to 
create a more consistent and more 
deterministic experience for messages 
once received within the System, which 
the Exchange believes improves the 
overall access experience on the 
Exchange and will enable future system 
enhancements. As noted, the BOEv3 
protocol and architecture, along with 
the three new corresponding Unitized 
Logical Ports, are intended to reduce the 
natural variance of order handler 
processing times for messages, and as a 
result reduce the potential resulting 
‘‘reordering’’ of messages when they are 
sent from order handlers to matching 
engines. The adoption of the unitized 
BOEv3 structure (including the 
corresponding new Unitized Ports) was 
a technical solution that is intended to 
reduce the potential of this reordering 
and increase determinism.
37
The 
Exchange believes the proposed fees are 
also reasonable to offset costs incurred 
in order to build out an entirely new 
unitized architecture. 
Furthermore, the Exchange also notes 
that it believes the proposed fees are 
similar to or less than fees assessed by 
other exchanges, for analogous 
connections as explained in further 
detail below.
38
The Exchange notes that 
other exchanges that offer similar 
pricing for similar connections have a 
comparable, or even lower, market share 
as the Exchange, as also detailed further 
below. Indeed, the Exchange has 
reviewed the U.S. options market share 
for each of the eighteen options markets 
utilizing total options contracts traded 
year-to-date as of the end of June 2025, 
as set forth in the following graph:

See e.g., MIAX Emerald Options Fee Schedule.

Due to the higher performance that offers 
higher throughput with more deterministic 
outcomes for participants, the revised architecture 
leads to a decreased demand in ports generally. 
42
The pricing amounts for MIAX Pearl and MIAX 
Emerald are based off of $600 per Purge Port fee per 
matching engine with a total of 12 matching engines 
(see MIAX Pearl Options—Reminder of rebalancing 
of the symbol distribution across Trade Matching 
Environments (Clouds) effective for Trading on May 
12, 2025 | MIAX and MIAX Emerald Options Rebalancing of the symbol distribution across Trade 
Matching Environments (Clouds) effective for

all Matching Engines by purchasing a set.

45
The Exchange notes that, based on publicly 
available information from MIAX Emerald and 
MIAX Pearl, a definitive comparison is not feasible. 
Rather, the Exchange could only reasonably infer 
that using the lowest tier for each of MIAX Emerald 
and MIAX Pearl may reasonably equate to connecting to 3 Exchange matching engines. The 
Exchange deduced that 3 Exchange matching 
engines may be a relevant comparison given the number of quoting symbols quoted per Exchange 
matching engine. 
The Exchange (market share of 4.30%) 
notes that the proposed Purge Unitized 
Logical Port fee of $400 to connect to a 
matching engine is lower than fees 
charged by at least two other exchanges 
with comparable (indeed, even lower) 
market share, particularly by MIAX 
Emerald (3.90% market share) and 
MIAX Pearl (2.7% market share). The 
Exchange does note that both MIAX 
Emerald and MIAX Pearl offer two 
purge ports for a matching engine 
connection at a cost of $600,
40
while the 
Exchange offers the primary Purge 
Unitized Logical Port as well as a 
secondary Purge Unitized Logical Port 
for its redundant secondary data center 
ports for $400. The Exchange believes 
that the bulk of the value customers 
derive is not within the quantity of 
Purge Unitized Logical Ports a Member 
purchases, but the ability to connect to 
the specific matching engine.
41
For 
instance, a Member may need to 
purchase several convenience ports to 
minimize the natural variance of order 
handler processing times for messages, 
but by comparison the same Member 
may only need to purchase a single 
Unitized Logical Port to achieve the 
same results. For this reason, the 
Exchange still believes it is better priced 
than MIAX Emerald’s and MIAX Pearl’s 
comparable offerings. 
Furthermore, even when comparing 
the costs of purchasing Purge Unitized 
Logical Ports to connect to all matching 
engines, the Exchange still assesses a 
lower fee than MIAX Pearl or MIAX 
Emerald. Connecting to all matching 
engines on MIAX Emerald or MIAX 
Pearl would cost $7,200, while 
connecting to all matching engines on 
BZX Options costs $2,500.
42
As noted 
above, while the Exchange believes the 
bulk of the value customers derive is the 
ability to connect to specific matching 
engines, and in this case, all matching 
engines, if a customer did want to have 
two Purge Unitized Logical Ports for all 
matching engines (in addition to the 
included secondary purge ports 
provided), it would cost the participant 
$5,000 ($2,500/set × 2)—still lower than the cost of $7,200 for two purge ports for 
all matching engines that MIAX 
Emerald and MIAX Pearl offer. 
While not as closely comparable, 
MIAX Emerald and MIAX Pearl both 
offer Full Service MEI Ports (analogous 
to the Exchange’s Bulk Port offering) 
and Limited Service MEI Ports 
(analogous to the Exchange’s BOE Port 
offering) that are based on the lesser of 
a participant’s per class basis or 
percentage of total national average 
daily volume measurement. For each 
matching engine a participant connects 
to (based on their activity), they receive 
two Full Service MEI Ports and four 
Limited Service MEI Ports.
43
Based on 
publicly available information, MEI 
ports provide market makers direct 
connections to each matching engine for 
high-speed mass quoting.
44
A Full 
Service MEI Ports support all input 
message types, and Limited Service MEI 
Ports support all message types except 
bulk quotes. 
Notably, MIAX Emerald and MIAX 
Pearl offer their Full Service MEI Ports 
and Limited Service MEI Ports only to 
market makers on those respective 
exchanges, and non-market maker 
members are not permitted to purchase 
MEI connections. As such, when 
comparing the Unitized Logical Port 
fees assessed to Market Makers by the 
Exchange to the Full Service MEI and 
Limited Service MEI Ports assessed to 
market makers by MIAX Emerald and 
MIAX Pearl, the Exchange believes that 
its proposed fee for Unitized Logical 
Ports is reasonable and justified by the 
value derived by Options Market 
Makers purchasing these connections in 
being able to connect directly to a 
certain matching engine. 
Specifically, presuming a participant 
is quoting up to 10 classes for MIAX 
Pearl or 5 classes for MIAX Emerald (the 
lowest available tier for each exchange), 
they are connecting to fewer matching 
engines than another participant who 
may be quoting over 100 classes (the 
highest tier available for both MIAX 
Pearl and MIAX Emerald). In comparing 
the monthly cost using the pricing of the 
lowest tiers for MIAX Pearl and MIAX 
Emerald, the Exchange presumes an 
estimated comparable connection of 
connecting to 3 different matching 
engines at a cost of $550 per Bulk Port 
per matching engine and $350 per BOE 
Port per matching engine.
45
This 
equates to $7,500 (($350 * 4 Ports * 3 
matching engines) + ($550 * 2 Ports * 
3 matching engines) per month for BZX 
Options, and $5,000 per month for both 
MIAX Pearl and Emerald. For the 
highest tier, the Exchange presumes that 
if a participant was quoting over 100 
classes, they are likely connecting to all 
matching engines. In this case, it costs 
a participant $12,000 per month for 
MIAX Pearl, $20,500 per month for 
MIAX Emerald, and $22,000 ($5,500 * 2 
Bulk Sets) + ($2,500 * 2 BOE Sets (Tier 
1)) + ($3,000 * 2 BOE Sets (Tier 2)) per 
month for BZX Options to connect to all 
matching engines. 
While the Exchange is priced higher 
in these specific examples, it again 
believes the value comes from the 
ability to connect to additional 
matching engines as opposed to the 
quantity of ports itself and participants 
of the Exchange are able to determine 
their number of desired ports as 
opposed to having a set package based 
on their Exchange activity. For example, 
a participant of BZX Options can have 
similar matching engine connectivity to 
the lowest tier of MIAX Emerald or 
MIAX Pearl by connecting to three 
matching engines (using the same 
presumed number as above) by 
purchasing three Bulk Ports for a cost of 
$1,650 per month, substantially less 
than the fixed costs of $5,000 per month 
of MIAX Emerald and MIAX Pearl. 
Additionally, a participant on BZX 
Options is able to connect to all 
matching engines for a price of $5,500 
per month by purchasing a Bulk Set as 
opposed to the fixed cost of MIAX 
Emerald and MIAX Pearl at $20,000 per 
month and $12,000 per month, 
respectively. Furthermore, MIAX 
Emerald does allow participants to 
purchase additional Limited Service 
ports at a price of $420 per month, 
higher than the Exchange’s comparable 
offering of $350 per month for a BOE 
port. While it is challenging to compare 
the exact pricing on these products, the 
Exchange believes that it is priced 
comparably, if not lower than MIAX 
Pearl and MIAX Emerald. 
The Exchange acknowledges that the 
above comparability analysis does not 
consider the fees assessed to non- 
Options Market Makers on the Exchange 
relative to non-market makers on MIAX 
Emerald or MIAX Pearl. This is due,

however, to the fact that MIAX Emerald 
and MIAX Pearl do not permit non- 
market makers to purchase MEI ports 
(the closest comparable product to 
BZX’s Unitized Logical Ports). 
Presumably, MIAX Emerald and MIAX 
Pearl limit such participants to use of 
only MIAX’s FIX ports. Importantly, 
unlike MIAX Emerald and MIAX Pearl, 
the Exchange permits its Members (i.e., 
non-Market Makers) to purchase a 
Unitized Logical Port, should such 
Member deem the use of such 
connection to be beneficial to their 
trading strategy. Additionally, Members 
(i.e., non-Market Makers) may instead elect to purchase Exchange BOE 
convenience or FIX Ports, or a 
combination of Unitized Logical Ports, 
BOE convenience and FIX ports. 
Furthermore, Members and Market 
Makers are free to choose to purchase 
Unitized Logical Ports in sets or by 
individual ports (dependent on the 
firm’s matching engine needs, which 
may be based on products it trades, 
strategies, or other business needs). As 
such, the Exchange’s offering is both 
more widely available and provides 
Members and Market Makers with more 
flexibility and customization in contrast 
to MIAX’s strict matching engine 
connectivity based on the classes a 
Market Maker is quoting in and its rigid 
fee structure. 
As an additional point of comparison 
for non-market makers, the Exchange 
notes the FIX port fees it charges it 
Members, relative to those charged by 
MIAX Emerald and MIAX Pearl for their 
non-market maker members.
46
 
Specifically, the Exchange charges its 
Members $750 per month, per 
convenience port (which may be FIX or 
BOE). MIAX Emerald
47
utilizes a 
progressive fee schedule for its FIX 
ports and charges its members a fee of 
$550 per month, per port, for the first 
FIX port; $350 per month, per port, for 
ports two through five; and $150 per 
month, per port, for each FIX port above 
five. MIAX Pearl
48
also utilizes a 
progressive fee schedule for its FIX 
ports, and charges its members $275 per 
month, per port, for the first FIX port; 
$175 per month, per port, for FIX ports 
two through five; and $75 per month, 
per port, for each sixth or more FIX port. 
While purchasing six FIX ports on the 
Exchange ($4,500)
49
would cost more 
than purchasing six FIX ports on MIAX 
Emerald ($3,100)
50
or MIAX Pearl 
($1,225),
51
the Exchange again notes 
that its Members are, unlike MIAX 
Emerald and MIAX Pearl members, 
permitted to purchase BOE ports, FIX 
ports, or Unitized Logical Ports, or a 
combination of the three, depending on 
their needs and strategy. In this regard, 
unlike MIAX Emerald and MIAX Pearl 
the Exchange’s Unitized Logical Port 
solution and its related benefits are 
available to all Members, and at a lower cost than that assessed to Members for 
a single FIX port ($750 for one FIX port, 
per month vs. $350 for one BOE 
Unitized Logical Port). Therefore, while 
FIX ports on the Exchange are more 
expensive than those on MIAX Emerald 
and MIAX Pearl, the Exchange’s port 
offerings as a whole provide Members 
and Market Makers with more flexibility 
in how to manage their Exchange access 
and better configure their connectivity 
costs based on their needs The 
Exchange also emphasizes that the use 
of the Unitized Logical Ports is not 
necessary for trading on the Exchange 
and, as noted above, is entirely optional 
(other than Market Makers which must 
utilize a Unitized Logical Port for 
quoting). The Exchange notes the 
following usage stats, current as of 
September 25, 2025: 
€Convenience Ports (FIX or BOEv3): Æ57% of Members still utilize a convenience layer port (FIX or BOEv3), 
in addition to or in lieu of Unitized 
Ports. On average, Market Makers utilize 
44 convenience ports. 
€BOEv3 Unitized Logical Port: ÆMarket Makers constitute 71% of all BOEv3 Unitized Logical Port usage, 
compared to 29% of Members (i.e., non- Market Makers). 
ÆMarket Makers constitute 70% of all BOEv3 Unitized Logical Port sets 
usage, while Members (i.e., non-Market Makers) constitute 30% of BOEv3 
Unitized Logical Port sets usage. 
€BOEv3 Unitized Logical Purge Port: ÆMarket Makers constitute 100% of all BOEv3 Unitized Logical Purge Port 
usage, and 100% of BOEv3 Unitized 
Logical Purge Port set usage. 
€BOEv3 Unitized Logical Bulk Port: ÆMarket Makers constitute 99% of all BOEv3 Unitized Logical Bulk Port 
Usage, while Members (i.e., non-Market Makers) constitute 1%. 
ÆMarket Makers constitute 99% of all BOEv3 Unitized Logical Bulk Port set 
usage, while Members (i.e., non-Market Makers) constitute 1% of BOEv3 
Unitized Logical Bulk Port set usage. 
The Exchange believes that the above 
statistics demonstrate that the use of 
Unitized Logical Ports and their 
associated fees are not mandatory per 
se. Indeed, Market Makers and Members 
alike are free to continue to utilize 
convenience ports for their message 
traffic as they best see fit, and may 
continue to access the Exchange through 
existing logical port offerings at existing 
rates. The Exchange believes that it is a 
Member’s specific business needs that 
will drive its decision whether to use 
Unitized Logical Ports in lieu of, or in 
addition to, existing logical ports (or, as 
emphasized, not use them at all). If a 
Member finds little benefit in having 
these ports based on its business model 
and trading strategies, or determines the 
Unitized Logical ports are not cost- 
efficient for its needs, or does not 
provide sufficient value to the firm, 
such Member may continue connecting 
to the Exchange in the manner it does 
today, unchanged. Moreover, the 
Exchange believes that providing 
Members the option of purchasing 
Unitized Logical Ports individually or in 
sets provides Members further 
flexibility and an opportunity for cost 
savings for those Members that wish to 
only trade a subset of classes. The 
Exchange has seen firms take advantage 
of individually priced Unitized Logical 
Ports when their needs do not require 
connectivity to all matching engines— 
further allowing its Members to pay 
reduced fees relative to a Unitized 
Logical Port set. 
Furthermore, the Exchange notes that 
undertaking a technological innovation, 
such as offering a new connectivity 
option for Members (of which, 57% still 
utilize at least one FIX or BOEv3 Port 
through the convenience layer), requires 
costs and resource allocation. In fact, as 
the Exchange previously noted, such 
innovation has improved the 
infrastructure for all Members of the 
Exchange. Such innovation is a part of 
what allows the Exchange to continue to 
provide access to markets in times of 
heightened volatility with zero 
downtime. The new Chairman of the 
Securities Exchange Commission, Paul 
Atkins, even recently heighted the 
importance of innovation by stating 
‘‘. . . we are getting back to our roots of 
promoting, rather than stifling, 
innovation. The markets innovate, and 
the SEC should not be in the business 
of telling them to stand still.’’

The Exchange notes that Market Makers are 
required to purchase and utilize a Unitized Logical 
Port for their quoting activity. 
54
See Cboe U.S. Options Fees Schedule, BZX Options, Options Logical Port Fees, Ports with Bulk 
Quoting Capabilities. 
55
Since the implementation of the proposal on 
September 3, 2024, the Exchange notes that it has 
not received any feedback from Market Maker 
participants that the proposal has impeded their 
ability to meet their quoting obligations. 
56
The Exchange notes that a Member’s ADO and 
ADQ rates will naturally vary based on options 
trading volume on the Exchange. In its initial filing 
the Exchange noted that while it could not predict 
with certainty any Member’s actual ADO and ADQ 
rates, that it believed approximately 74% of 
Members would fall into Tier 1, and the remaining 
26% would fall outside of Tier 1. In this filing, the 
stated ADO and ADQ rates are from August 2025, 
and represent that approximately 50% of Members 
fell out of Tier 1. While this percentage is greater 
than the 26% of Members noted in the Exchange’s 
initial filing, the Exchange notes that average daily 
volume (‘‘ADV’’) in August 2025 across Cboe’s four 
U.S. options exchange was at an all-time high of 
19.2 million contracts, comprised of: record multi- 
listed options ADV of 14.3 millions contracts, 
which surpassed the ADV record of 13.6 million 
contracts set in February 2025; and S&P 500 Index 
(SPX) options ADV of 3.8 million contracts, the 
second-best month of all time, with zero-days-to- 
expiry (0DTE) trading representing a record ADV of 
2.4 million contracts. See ‘‘Cboe Global Markets Reports Trading Volume for August 2025,’’

Release). 
innovation and, in turn, work to 
improve the resiliency of markets, 
exchanges must have reasonable 
certainty around their ability to set fees. 
The Exchange also believes that the 
proposed Unitized Logical Port fees are 
equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory because they continue to 
be assessed uniformly to similarly 
situated users in that all Members who 
choose to purchase Unitized Logical 
Ports will be subject to the same 
proposed tiered fee schedule. Moreover, 
Members purchasing Unitized Logical 
Ports will only do so if they find a 
benefit and sufficient value in such 
ports as all Members can otherwise 
continue to use the preexisting logical 
connectivity options.
53
As such, 
Members can choose whether to 
purchase Unitized Logical Ports based 
on their respective business needs. 
The proposed ascending tier structure 
for Unitized Logical Port Sets is 
reasonable, equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory as it is designed to 
encourage market participants to be 
efficient with their respective Unitized 
Logical Port usage. It also is designed so 
that Members that use a higher 
allotment of the Exchange’s system 
resources pay higher rates, rather than 
placing that burden on market 
participants that have more modest 
needs. The Exchange believes the 
proposed ascending fee structure is 
therefore another appropriate means, in 
conjunction with an established 
Unitized Logical Port limit, to manage 
this finite resource (system capacity) 
and ensure it is apportioned fairly. 
In contrast, MIAX’s structure limits its 
offering to a specific subset of 
participants, Market Makers, and 
allocates its ports based on quoting. In 
contrast, the Exchange and its 
participants are free to utilize this 
product at their required level of 
consumption. Furthermore, the 
Exchange already assesses higher fees to 
those that consume more Exchange 
resources for the existing non-Unitized 
Bulk Ports.
54
The proposed limit on 
Unitized Logical Ports is also 
reasonable, equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory as the Exchange believes 
that it is in the interests of all Members 
and market participants who access the 
Exchange to not allow Members to 
exhaust System resources, but to 
encourage efficient usage of network 
capacity. The Exchange also notes that 
the new BOEv3 unitized architecture is 
subject to software limitations on the 
number of sessions that can be created 
on any one unitized process. 
Consideration was given to this 
limitation as well as to the amount of 
ports firms had indicated they would 
need prior to the implementation of 
Unitized Logical Ports. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
ADO and ADQ fees are reasonable as 
Members that do not exceed the high 
thresholds of 2,000,000 ADO and 
250,000,000 ADQ will not be charged 
any fee under the proposed tiers. The 
Exchange notes that in establishing the 
proposed thresholds, it evaluated 
average ADO and ADQ rates over 
several months and the thresholds were 
designed to protect the Exchange’s 
Matching Engines from being adversely 
impacted from sustained and excessive 
orders/quotes throughout the course of 
a given month. Further, the Exchange 
considered the highest levels of ADO 
and ADQ rates amongst firms and from 
there, reviewed what would be 
considered an unreasonable threshold 
even at the highest levels. The ADQ 
thresholds are also designed to ensure 
Market Makers quoting activity, which 
acts as an important source of liquidity, 
is not impeded by the proposal.
55
In 
fact, when setting these thresholds, the 
Exchange reviewed to ensure that these 
levels would not prohibit Market 
Makers from meetings quoting 
obligations. 
The Exchange also believes it is 
reasonable, equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory to assess higher fees 
when a Member has higher ADO and 
ADQ rates because the potential impact 
on exchange systems, bandwidth and 
capacity becomes greater with increased 
ADO and ADQ rates. In this regard, the 
fees are designed to apply only to those 
Members whose message traffic is 
noticeably beyond the proposed ADO 
and ADQ rates. In particular, the 
proposed fee amounts that correspond 
to higher ADO and ADQ rates are 
designed to incentivize Members to 
reduce excessive order and quoting 
trade activity that the Exchange believes 
can be detrimental to all market 
participants at those levels and 
encourage such activity to be made in 
good faith and for legitimate purposes. 
As of the end of August 2025, the 
Exchange notes that all but one Member 
fell within the proposed ADO Tier 1, 
resulting in that one single Member 
being assessed additional ADO fees. 
With regards to ADQ, 9 Members fell 
into Tier 1 and were not assessed any 
additional ADQ fees. Additionally, 4 
Members fell into Tier 2, 2 Members fell 
into Tier 3, 2 Members fell into Tier 4, 
and 1 Member fell into Tier 5, and were 
assessed related ADQ fees.
56
 
Importantly, as noted above, the 
Exchange believes that it is in the 
interests of all Members and market 
participants who access the Exchange to 
not allow Members to exhaust System 
resources, but to encourage efficient 
usage of network capacity. The 
Exchange therefore also believes that the 
proposed fees are one method of 
facilitating the Commission’s goal of 
ensuring that critical market 
infrastructure has ‘‘levels of capacity, 
integrity, resiliency, availability, and 
security adequate to maintain their 
operational capability and promote the 
maintenance of fair and orderly 
markets.’’
57
Furthermore, the Exchange 
believes adopting the proposed ADO 
and ADQ fees are reasonable as 
unfettered usage of System capacity and 
network resource consumption can have 
a detrimental effect on all market 
participants who access and use the 
Exchange. As discussed above, high 
ADO and ADQ rates may adversely 
impact system resources, bandwidth, 
and capacity which may, in turn, create 
latency and impact other Members’ 
ability to receive timely executions. 
Moreover, the Exchange believes that 
the proposed ADO and ADQ fees are 
equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory because they will be 
assessed uniformly to similarly situated

users in that all Members that exceed 
the thresholds in connection with ADO 
and ADQ will be assessed the proposed 
ADO and ADQ rates. Regarding ADO 
and ADQ, no market participant is 
assessed any fees unless it exceeds the 
proposed thresholds. The Exchange also 
believes it is equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory to assess incrementally 
higher fees to Members that have higher 
ADO and ADQ rates because the 
potential impact on exchange systems, 
bandwidth and capacity becomes 
greater with increased ADO and ADQ. 
Furthermore, the Exchange believes it 
is equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory to aggregate Members 
trading activity with any affiliated 
Member sharing at least 75% common 
ownership
58
in order to prevent 
members from shifting their order flow 
or quoting activity to other affiliates in 
order to circumvent the ADO and ADQ 
thresholds. 
The Exchange lastly believes that its 
proposal is reasonable, equitably 
allocated and not unfairly 
discriminatory because it is not 
intended to raise revenue for the 
Exchange; rather, it is intended to 
encourage efficient behavior so that 
Members do not exhaust System 
resources. Moreover, as noted above, 
competing options exchanges similarly 
assess fees to deter Members from over 
utilizing their respective systems by 
having excessive order and/or quoting 
trading activity.
59
 
Finally, the Exchange notes that it 
operates in a highly competitive market 
in which market participants can 
readily direct order flow to competing 
venues if they deem fee levels at a 
particular venue to be excessive or 
incentives to be insufficient. The 
Exchange is only one of 18 options 
exchanges which market participants 
may direct their order flow and/or 
participate on, and it represents a small 
percentage of the overall market.
60
 
When determining reasonable prices, 
the Exchange must ensure these are 
competitive prices in order to maintain 
market share, as uncompetitive pricing, 
or prices that Members deem to be 
excessive, can lead Members to take 
their order flow to other exchanges. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change to adopt fees 
for Unitized Logical Ports will impose 
any burden on intramarket competition 
that is not necessary in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act because the 
proposed fees for will apply equally to 
all similarly situated Members. As 
discussed above, Unitized Logical Ports 
are optional
61
and Members may 
choose to utilize Unitized Logical Ports 
or not, based on their views of the 
additional benefits and added value 
provided by these ports. The Exchange 
believes the proposed fees will be 
assessed proportionately to the potential 
value or benefit received by Members 
with a greater number of Unitized 
Logical Ports and notes that Members 
may determine to cease using Unitized 
Logical Ports should they determine that 
they are no longer receiving value from 
these ports. As discussed, Members can 
also continue to access the Exchange 
through existing Logical Ports, which 
fees are not changing. Moreover, while 
the NYSE Arca Marketplace (‘‘Arca’’) 
and Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC 
(‘‘Nasdaq’’) do not have offerings 
directly comparable to Unitized Logical 
Ports, the Exchange notes that Arca’s 
and Nasdaq’s port fees are higher than 
those of the Exchange. Specifically, the 
Exchange notes that Arca charges a fee 
of $621 per quoting/order entry port,
62
 
and Nasdaq assess its members a fee of 
$575 per FIX order entry port.
63
In both 
cases, Arca and Nasdaq’s port fees are 
more expensive than the proposed fees 
for a single BOE Unitized Logical Port 
($350/port/month), a single Bulk 
Unitized Logical Port ($550/port/ 
month), and a single Purge Unitized 
Logical Port ($400/port/month). 
Similarly, the Exchange does not 
believe that the proposed rule change to 
adopt ADO and ADQ fees will impose 
any burden on intramarket competition 
that is not necessary in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act because such 
fees will apply equally to all similarly 
situated Members. Particularly, the 
proposed fees apply uniformly to all 
Members, in that any Member who 
exceeds the ADO and/or ADQ Tier 1 
thresholds will be subject to a fee under 
the proposed corresponding tiers. The 
Exchange believes that the proposed 
change neither favors nor penalizes one 
or more categories of market 
participants in a manner that would 
impose an undue burden on 
competition. Rather, the proposal seeks 
to benefit all market participants by 
encouraging the efficient utilization of 
the Exchange’s network while taking 
into account the important liquidity 
provided by its Members. As discussed 
above potential impact on exchange 
systems, bandwidth, and capacity 
becomes greater with increased ADO 
and ADQ rates. Accordingly, the 
Exchange believes that the proposed 
ADO and ADQ fees do not favor certain 
categories of market participants in a 
manner that would impose a burden on 
competition. 
Next, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change does not impose 
any burden on intermarket competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
As previously discussed, the Exchange 
operates in a highly competitive market, 
including competition for order flow. 
Market Participants have numerous 
alternative venues that they may 
participate on, including 17 other 
options exchanges (including 3 other 
Cboe-affiliated options exchanges), as 
well as off-exchange venues, where 
competitive products are available for 
trading. Indeed, participants can readily 
choose to submit their order flow to 
other exchange and off-exchange venues 
if they deem fee levels at those other 
venues to be more favorable. Moreover, 
the Commission has repeatedly 
expressed its preference for competition 
over regulatory intervention in 
determining prices, products, and 
services in the securities markets. 
Specifically, in Regulation NMS, the 
Commission highlighted the importance 
of market forces in determining prices 
and SRO revenues and, also, recognized 
that current regulation of the market 
system ‘‘has been remarkably successful 
in promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to

64
The 
fact that this market is competitive has 
also long been recognized by the courts. 
In NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission, the D.C. Circuit 
stated as follows: ‘‘[n]o one disputes 
that competition for order flow is 
‘fierce.’ . . . As the SEC explained, ‘[i]n 
the U.S. national market system, buyers 
and sellers of securities, and the broker- 
dealers that act as their order-routing 
agents, have a wide range of choices of 
where to route orders for execution’; 
[and] ‘no exchange can afford to take its 
market share percentages for granted’ 
because ‘no exchange possesses a 
monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in 
the execution of order flow from broker 
dealers’. . . .’’.
65
Accordingly, the 
Exchange does not believe its proposed 
change imposes any burden on 
competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received comments on the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) 
of the Act
66
and paragraph (f) of Rule 
19b–4
67
thereunder. At any time within 
60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved.

9
For the 
reasons discussed below, the 
Commission is approving the proposed 
rule change, as modified by Amendment 
No. 1. 
I. Description of the Proposed Rule 
Change 
A. Background 
FICC, through GSD, serves as a central 
counterparty (‘‘CCP’’) and provider of 
clearance and settlement services for 
transactions in U.S. Treasury securities. 
As a CCP, FICC novates transactions 
between two counterparties, effectively 
becoming the buyer to every seller and 
the seller to every buyer, and guarantees 
settlement of the novated transactions. 
GSD’s CCP services are available 
directly to entities that are approved 
under the GSD Rules to be Netting 
Members and indirectly to other market 
participants through GSD’s indirect 
access models, the Sponsored Service 
and Agent Clearing Service, described 
more fully below. 
A CCP is exposed to a number of risks 
that arise from novating trades, 
including counterparty credit risk, 
because the CCP guarantees the 
performance of every novated trade and 
thereby becomes the entity exposed to 
potential financial loss if a counterparty 
defaults on its obligations to deliver 
cash and/or securities. FICC addresses 
these risks through a risk management 
framework that governs, among other 
things, various actions that FICC may 
take following the default of its Netting 
Members, including those Netting 
Members that act as intermediaries for 
indirect participants as either 
Sponsoring Members or Agent Clearing 
Members. 
As described more fully below, FICC 
believes that enhancing the GSD Rules 
regarding default management 
(particularly for Agent Clearing 
Members) and porting would encourage 
greater participation in central clearing 
by improving market participants’ 
understanding of how GSD would 
manage a default that may occur within 
GSD’s indirect access models.
10
 
GSD’s Indirect Access Models 
The GSD Rules provide for two 
indirect access models, the Sponsored 
Service and the Agent Clearing 
Service.
11
The Sponsored Service and 
the Agent Clearing Service provide 
Indirect Participants with different 
options to access FICC’s clearance and 
settlement services. The primary 
differences between the two services are 
that (1) Indirect Participants within the 
Sponsored Service must establish a 
limited purpose GSD membership, 
whereas Indirect Participants within the 
Agent Clearing Service do not establish 
any such membership, and (2) 
Sponsored Member Trades are margined 
on a gross basis, whereas Agent Clearing 
Transactions may be margined on a net 
basis when recorded in the same Agent 
Clearing Member Omnibus Account. 
As described in GSD Rule 3A, the 
Sponsored Service permits Members 
that are approved to be Sponsoring 
Members to sponsor certain institutional 
firms (i.e., Sponsored Members) into GSD membership.
12
For these 
relationships, FICC establishes and 
maintains a ‘‘Sponsoring Member 
Omnibus Account’’ on its books where 
it records the transactions of the 
Sponsoring Member’s Sponsored 
Members (‘‘Sponsored Member 
Trades’’).
13
For purposes of managing 
the risks presented by Sponsored 
Member Trades, activity recorded in a 
Sponsoring Member Omnibus Account 
is margined on a gross (i.e., Sponsored Member-by-Sponsored Member) basis 
and cannot be netted across Sponsored 
Members.
14
 
Although a Sponsored Member is a 
limited member of GSD and the legal 
counterparty to FICC for any submitted 
transactions, the Sponsoring Member 
unconditionally guarantees to FICC the 
payment and performance of a 
Sponsored Member’s obligations to 
FICC (‘‘Sponsoring Member 
Guaranty’’).
15
Therefore, FICC relies on 
the financial resources of the 
Sponsoring Member in relying upon the 
Sponsoring Member Guaranty. 
FICC’s Agent Clearing Service 
facilitates agent-style trading by 
allowing Members that are approved to 
be Agent Clearing Members to submit 
trades of their customers (i.e., Executing Firm Customers) to GSD for clearance 
and settlement.
16
FICC establishes and 
maintains an ‘‘Agent Clearing Member 
Omnibus Account’’ on its books where 
it records the transactions of the Agent 
Clearing Member’s Executing Firm 
Customers (‘‘Agent Clearing 
Transactions’’).
17
Unlike Sponsored 
Members, Executing Firm Customers do 
not become limited members of GSD. 
Agent Clearing Members act as both 
processing agent and credit 
intermediary for their customers in 
clearing, and Executing Firm Customers 
are identified on Agent Clearing 
Transactions when such activity is 
submitted to FICC. FICC may net the 
Agent Clearing Transactions of one or 
more Executing Firm Customers whose 
activity is recorded in the same Agent 
Clearing Member Omnibus Account for 
purposes of calculating the required 
margin deposits. 
The activity for Indirect Participants 
must be recorded in GSD accounts that 
are separate from the accounts in which 
the intermediary Netting Members’ own 
proprietary transactions are recorded.

an Indirect Participant and a party other than the 
Indirect Participant’s Sponsoring Member of Agent 
Clearing Member (i.e., either another Netting Member or Indirect Participant). 
39
See GSD Rule 8, supra note 3. 40
See GSD Rule 22B, supra note 3. 41
See id. 
Additionally, both Sponsoring Members 
and Agent Clearing Members have the 
option of designating certain Indirect 
Participants as Segregated Indirect 
Participants. The activity for Segregated 
Indirect Participants must be recorded 
in a separate Segregated Indirect 
Participant Account, which allows the 
Sponsoring Member or Agent Clearing 
Member to direct FICC to calculate and 
segregate margin deposited in 
connection with these separate 
Accounts (‘‘Segregated Customer 
Margin’’) in accordance with the 
conditions in Note H to Rule 15c3–3a 
under the Exchange Act (‘‘Note H’’).
19
In 
this way, all Segregated Customer 
Margin deposited with FICC to support 
the obligations arising under the 
transactions recorded in a given 
Segregated Indirect Participants 
Account must be recorded in a specific 
Segregated Customer Margin Custody 
Account maintained by FICC on its 
books and records for the Netting 
Member that deposited such Segregated 
Customer Margin, which account would 
be separate from any other accounts 
maintained by FICC for the Netting 
Member, including fellow Segregated 
Customer Margin Custody Accounts. 
Finally, Segregated Customer Margin 
deposits must be met using assets 
deposited by the Segregated Indirect 
Participants with the Netting Member, 
with a limited exception of temporary 
‘‘prefunding’’ by the Netting Member 
while a margin call to the Segregated 
Indirect Participant is outstanding.
20
 
Default Management in the Current GSD 
Rules 
The GSD Rules currently include 
default management provisions that 
describe the circumstances that would 
allow FICC to suspend, prohibit, or limit 
a Member’s access to FICC’s services.
21
 
GSD Rule 21 enumerates the 
circumstances that would provide cause 
for FICC’s Board of Directors (‘‘Board’’) 
to suspend, prohibit, or limit a 
Member’s access to FICC’s services.
22
 
Additionally, GSD Rule 22 enumerates 
the circumstances that would cause a 
Member to be treated as insolvent.
23
If 
any of the enumerated circumstances 
arise, FICC may suspend a Member from 
any service provided by FICC, either 
with respect to one or more particular 
transactions or with respect to 
transactions generally, or FICC may 
prohibit or limit such Member’s access 
to services offered by FICC.
24
When 
FICC restricts a Member’s access to 
services pursuant to GSD Rule 22A, 
FICC is said to have ‘‘ceased to act’’ for 
a Defaulting Member.
25
 
GSD Rule 22A describes the general 
default management procedures FICC 
follows once it has ceased to act for a 
Defaulting Member, including 
provisions for the treatment of the 
Defaulting Member’s pending 
transactions.
26
Unless FICC’s Board 
determines otherwise, from the time 
that FICC has ceased to act for the 
Defaulting Member, FICC would not 
process any trades that are not 
Compared Trades
27
to which the 
Defaulting Member is a party.
28
GSD 
Rule 22A also sets forth the close-out 
process that FICC would follow upon 
ceasing to act for a Defaulting 
Member.
29
The close-out process starts 
with the creation of a ‘‘Final Net 
Settlement Position’’ for each Eligible 
Netting Security with a distinct CUSIP 
Number.
30
This position is a net of all 
outstanding Deliver Obligations and 
Receive Obligations of the Defaulting 
Member in each such security.
31
FICC 
then buys, sells, or otherwise liquidates 
the Final Net Settlement Positions.
32
 
GSD Rule 3A incorporates the default 
management provisions described above 
into the Sponsored Service.
33
Thus, 
FICC may suspend, prohibit, or limit 
access to FICC’s services by Sponsoring 
Members and Sponsored Members 
when any of the applicable 
circumstances enumerated in GSD Rule 
21 would provide cause for such 
action.
34
If FICC ceases to act for a 
Sponsoring Member or Sponsored 
Member, the relevant provisions of GSD 
Rule 22A would apply.
35
Additionally, 
if FICC ceases to act for a Sponsoring 
Member, GSD Rule 3A provides FICC 
with the discretion to determine 
whether to close-out any affected 
Sponsored Member Trades and/or 
permit the Sponsored Members to 
complete their settlement.
36
If FICC 
determines to complete settlement, the 
Sponsored Member Trades would settle 
pursuant to the GSD Rules in the normal 
course of business.
37
GSD Rule 3A also 
includes provisions that govern the 
voluntary liquidation of done-with 
Sponsored Member Trades by either the 
Sponsoring Member or FICC.
38
 
The GSD Rules that describe the 
Agent Clearing Service currently do not 
contain provisions that would govern 
the default of an Agent Clearing 
Member.
39
 
The GSD Rules currently do not 
contain provisions that would permit 
the porting of indirect participant 
positions and margin between Netting 
Member intermediaries, neither in the 
regular course of business nor following 
the default of a Netting Member 
intermediary. 
Finally, GSD Rule 22B describes the 
circumstances that would constitute a 
default by FICC (‘‘Corporation Default’’) 
and the actions that would follow such 
an event, including how novated 
transactions would be treated.
40
 
Specifically, following a Corporation 
Default, novated, unsettled transactions 
would be terminated, and Members 
would be required to take market action 
to close-out those positions and report 
the results of such action to FICC’s 
Board.
41
GSD Rule 22B applies to 
activity that is cleared through the

but the 
provisions of GSD Rule 22B currently 
do not specify how Sponsored Member 
Transactions, or other Indirect 
Participant activity, would be treated 
following a Corporation Default.
43
 
B. Proposed Changes 
FICC proposes to expand the default 
management provisions in the GSD 
Rules applicable to the Sponsored 
Service and Agent Clearing Service to 
more fully address the default scenarios 
of Netting Member intermediaries, 
Indirect Participants, and FICC. 
Additionally, FICC proposes to add 
provisions to the GSD Rules that govern 
the porting of Indirect Participant 
activity between intermediary Netting 
Members, both in the normal course of 
business and following the default of an 
intermediary. Finally, FICC proposes 
several non-substantive technical 
updates and corrections to the GSD 
Rules. 
FICC states that the proposed changes 
would encourage greater utilization of 
central clearing on the part of market 
participants by providing additional 
information in the GSD Rules regarding 
the rights and obligations of FICC’s 
direct and indirect participants in the 
event of a default.
44
Additionally, FICC 
states that adding new porting 
provisions to the GSD Rules would 
provide indirect participants with a tool 
to manage their clearing activity and 
intermediary relationships and to 
manage their exposures to a defaulting 
intermediary.
45
FICC states that the 
proposed changes would thereby further 
facilitate access to GSD’s clearance and 
settlement services.
46
 
1. Default Management Rules Governing 
the Sponsored Service 
Sponsoring Member or Sponsored 
Member Default 
Currently, Sections 13 through 16 of 
GSD Rule 3A address the default of a 
Sponsoring Member or Sponsored 
Member by incorporating GSD Rules 21, 
22, and 22A, making those provisions 
applicable to Sponsoring Members, 
Sponsored Members, and Sponsored 
Member Trades.
47
 
As described above, in the event FICC 
ceases to act for a Sponsoring Member, 
Section 14(c) of GSD Rule 3A currently 
provides FICC with the discretion to 
either close-out affected Sponsored 
Member Trades and/or permit the 
Sponsored Members to complete their 
settlement.
48
FICC proposes to add a 
third alternative to the disposition of 
Sponsored Member Trades following a 
Sponsoring Member default—the 
porting (i.e., transfer) of those positions to a different Sponsoring Member 
pursuant to proposed GSD Rule 26, 
discussed more fully below.
49
 
FICC also proposes to add a new 
Section 14(d)(i) to GSD Rule 3A to 
provide additional information 
regarding the operation of the settlement 
process.
50
Specifically, if FICC 
determines to permit the Sponsored 
Member of a defaulting Sponsoring 
Member to complete settlement with 
respect to affected Sponsored Member 
Trades, such settlement shall occur in 
accordance with Section 8 of GSD Rule 
3A, as though the Sponsoring Member 
was not a Defaulting Member pursuant 
to GSD Rule 22A.
51
 
FICC also proposes to add a new 
Section 14(d)(ii) to GSD Rule 3A to 
provide additional information 
regarding the close-out process of 
Sponsored Member Trades.
52
 
Specifically, if FICC determines to 
close-out the Sponsored Member Trades 
of a defaulting Sponsoring Member, 
FICC may net the positions of each 
Sponsored Member (including each 
Segregated Indirect Participant that is a 
Sponsored Member), in determining a 
Final Net Settlement Position.
53
 
However, FICC would not net the 
positions of one Sponsored Member (or 
Segregated Indirect Participant) against 
the positions of another Sponsored 
Member (or Segregated Indirect 
Participant).
54
 
Additionally, as originally filed, 
proposed Section 14(d)(ii) of GSD Rule 
3A would provide that, with respect to 
any amount due to a Segregated Indirect 
Participant that is a Sponsored Member, 
FICC would make such payment to or as 
directed by the Sponsoring Member or 
its trustee or receiver.
55
In Amendment 
No. 1, FICC proposes to amend 
proposed Section 14(d)(ii) of GSD Rule 
3A to clarify its applicability to 
Sponsored Members in general.
56
FICC’s 
proposals to change Section 14(d) of 
GSD Rule 3A would not alter FICC’s 
current processes.
57
 
Sponsoring Member’s Ability To Close- 
Out Sponsored Member Trades 
Currently, Section 18(b) of GSD Rule 
3A allows a Sponsoring Member to 
terminate all, but not fewer than all, of 
a Sponsored Member’s positions and 
corresponding positions in the 
Sponsoring Member’s Dealer Account.
58
 
In Amendment No. 1, FICC proposes to 
amend Section 18 (re-numbered Section 
16) of GSD Rule 3A to provide 
Sponsoring Members the ability to 
close-out some or all of the relevant 
Sponsored Member Trades.
59
FICC 
states that providing such flexibility 
would better facilitate the ability of 
Sponsoring Members to provide clearing 
services to Sponsored Members.
60
 
Description of Additional Liquidation 
Mechanisms 
Currently, Section 18 of GSD Rule 3A 
includes a provision that governs the 
voluntary liquidation of done-with 
Sponsored Member Trades by either the 
Sponsoring Member or FICC.
61
In 
Amendment No. 1, FICC proposes to 
amend Section 18 (re-numbered Section 
16) of GSD Rule 3A to describe 
additional mechanisms through which 
Sponsoring Members may liquidate both 
done-with and done-away transactions 
of Sponsored Members.
62
 
Specifically, FICC proposes to add a 
provision to Section 18 (re-numbered 
Section 16) of GSD Rule 3A that would 
describe two additional liquidation 
mechanisms (‘‘SMP Liquidation 
Actions’’) available to Sponsoring 
Members to liquidate both done-with 
and done-away Sponsored Member 
Trades of a Sponsored Member.
63
First, 
to liquidate positions resulting from 
Sponsored Member Trades other than 
Sponsored GC Trades, the Sponsoring

See Notice of Amendment No. 1, supra note 9, 90 FR at 45852. This offsetting mechanism would 
not be available for Sponsored GC Trades because 
FICC settles Sponsored GC Trades on a gross basis 
and, therefore, an offsetting trade would not 
effectively liquidate a Sponsored GC Trade. See id.

Member may submit to FICC (to be 
recorded in the Sponsoring Member 
Omnibus Account) another Sponsored 
Member Trade that offsets, in whole or 
in part, any Net Settlement Position or 
Forward Net Settlement Position 
established in such Sponsoring Member 
Omnibus Account (the ‘‘Offsetting 
Transaction Mechanism’’).
64
Second, for 
any Sponsored Member Trades, the 
Sponsoring Member may instruct FICC 
to transfer to a Proprietary Account of 
the Sponsoring Member any Net 
Settlement Position or Forward Net 
Settlement Position established in a 
Sponsoring Member Omnibus Account 
(the ‘‘Transfer Mechanism’’). As a result 
of such instruction, the positions would 
become the proprietary positions of the 
Sponsoring Member.
65
 
2. Default Management Rules Governing 
the Agent Clearing Service 
As described above, current GSD Rule 
8 does not address default management 
within the Agent Clearing Service.
66
 
FICC proposes to adopt new provisions 
in GSD Rule 8 to govern the default of 
an Agent Clearing Member.
67
FICC also 
proposes to adopt new provisions in 
GSD Rule 8 that would align the default 
management processes across Indirect 
Participants (i.e., Executing Firm Customers using the Agent Clearing 
Service and Sponsored Members using 
the Sponsored Service) where such 
alignment is appropriate.
68
 
Voluntary Termination of Agent 
Clearing Member Status 
Section 3(g) of GSD Rule 8 currently 
provides that an Agent Clearing Member 
may terminate its status as an Agent 
Clearing Member by providing notice to 
FICC.
69
However, this provision does 
not provide certainty regarding the 
treatment of the terminated Agent 
Clearing Member’s unsettled Agent 
Clearing Transactions.
70
FICC proposes 
to expand Section 3(g) of GSD Rule 8 to 
include provisions aligned with those in 
Section 2(i) of GSD Rule 3A applicable 
to the voluntary termination of 
Sponsoring Member status.
71
However, 
proposed Section 3(g) of GSD Rule 8 
would reflect substantive differences 
between the voluntary termination of an 
Agent Clearing Member and a 
Sponsoring Member, including: (1) the 
Sponsoring Member Guaranty is not 
applicable within the Agent Clearing 
Service; and (2) FICC need not post an 
Important Notice when an Agent 
Clearing Member voluntarily terminates 
its status as such with respect to all 
Executing Firm Customers because FICC 
does not publish lists of Agent Clearing 
Members and their Executing Firm 
Customer relationships.
72
Additionally, 
FICC proposes to expand Section 3(g) of 
GSD Rule 8 to include a more detailed 
description of the actions to be taken by 
both the Agent Clearing Member and 
FICC when an Agent Clearing Member 
voluntarily terminates its status as 
such.
73
 
Termination of Executing Firm 
Customer(s) Access to the Agent 
Clearing Service 
FICC proposes to add a new Section 
3(h) to GSD Rule 8 that would permit 
FICC to terminate the access of one or 
more Executing Firm Customers to the 
Agent Clearing Service.
74
FICC states 
that it may take such action, for 
example, if an Executing Firm Customer 
is subject to sanctions that would 
restrict or prohibit FICC from processing 
the Executing Firm Customer’s 
transactions.
75
 
FICC’s Right To Offset Agent Clearing 
Member Obligations 
FICC proposes to add a new Section 
5(f) to GSD Rule 8 to provide that when 
any obligation of an Agent Clearing 
Member arises under the GSD Rules to 
pay or perform with respect to an 
Executing Firm Customer, FICC may 
exercise a right to offset and net any 
such obligation against any obligations 
of FICC to the Agent Clearing Member 
in respect of such Agent Clearing 
Member’s Proprietary Accounts.
76
This 
provision would align with Section 11 
of GSD Rule 3A applicable to the 
Sponsored Service, except with respect 
to the Sponsoring Member Guaranty, 
which is not applicable to the Agent 
Clearing Service.
77
 
Application of GSD’s Loss Allocation 
Provisions to the Agent Clearing Service 
FICC proposes to expand Section 7(f) 
of GSD Rule 8 to state that Executing 
Firm Customers shall not be obligated 
for allocations of loss or liability 
incurred by FICC pursuant to GSD Rule 
4.
78
To the extent a loss or liability is 
determined by FICC to arise in 
connection with Agent Clearing 
Transactions (i.e., in connection with the insolvency or default of an Agent 
Clearing Member), the Executing Firm 
Customers shall not be responsible for, 
or considered in, the loss allocation 
calculation and such obligation would 
be the responsibility of the Agent 
Clearing Member.
79
These provisions 
would align with Section 12(a) of GSD 
Rule 3A applicable to the Sponsored 
Service, except with respect to Off-the- 
Market Transactions, which are not 
applicable to Agent Clearing 
Transactions.
80
 
Agent Clearing Member Default 
FICC proposes to add Section 8 to 
GSD Rule 8 to describe the default 
management process that would govern 
the default of an Agent Clearing 
Member.
81
These proposed provisions 
would align with Section 14 of GSD 
Rule 3A applicable to the Sponsored 
Service, as appropriate.
82
Section 8 of 
GSD Rule 8 would address an Agent 
Clearing Member default by 
incorporating GSD Rules 21, 22, and 
22A, making those provisions 
applicable to Agent Clearing Members 
and Agent Clearing Transactions.
83
 
Additionally, in the event FICC ceases 
to act for an Agent Clearing Member, 
Section 8(c) of GSD Rule 8 would 
provide FICC with the discretion to 
either close-out affected Agent Clearing 
Transactions, permit the Executing Firm 
Customers to complete their settlement, 
or port (i.e., transfer) all or part of those positions to a different Agent Clearing 
Member pursuant to proposed GSD Rule 
26, discussed more fully below.
84
 
Section 8(d) of GSD Rule 8 would 
provide that if FICC determines to 
permit the Executing Firm Customers of 
the defaulting Agent Clearing Member 
to complete settlement with respect to 
affected Agent Clearing Transactions, 
settlement shall occur as if the Agent 
Clearing Member was not a Defaulting 
Member pursuant to GSD Rule 22A.
85
 
Section 8(e) of GSD Rule 8 would 
provide that FICC may net the positions 
of Executing Firm Customers (other than

Segregated Indirect Participants) against 
the positions of other Executing Firm 
Customers that are recorded in the same 
Agent Clearing Member Omnibus 
Account in determining a Final Net 
Settlement Position.
86
Finally, Section 
8(e) of GSD Rule 8 would provide that 
with respect to any amount due to a 
Segregated Indirect Participant that is an 
Executing Firm Customer, FICC would 
make such payment to or as directed by 
the Agent Clearing Member or its trustee 
or receiver.
87
 
Liquidation of Agent Clearing 
Transactions 
FICC proposes to add a new Section 
9 to GSD Rule 8 to describe the ability 
of FICC and Agent Clearing Members to 
liquidate the done-with Agent Clearing 
Transactions of an Executing Firm 
Customer and outline the operation of 
that liquidation.
88
Overall, proposed 
Section 9 of GSD Rule 8 would align 
with the parallel provisions in GSD Rule 
3A that address the voluntary 
liquidation of Sponsored Member 
Trades, except with respect to the 
Sponsoring Member Guaranty and to 
reflect that unlike Sponsored Members, 
Executing Firm Customers are not GSD 
members.
89
 
Section 9(a) of GSD Rule 8 would 
provide that liquidation can only occur 
if the Agent Clearing Member is not a 
Defaulting Member, FICC has not ceased 
to act for the Agent Clearing Member, 
and no Corporation Default has 
occurred.
90
Section 9(b) of GSD Rule 8 
would provide that either the Agent 
Clearing Member or FICC may terminate 
the long and short Net Settlement 
Positions and Forward Net Settlement 
Positions of the Executing Firm 
Customer and the corresponding 
positions of the Agent Clearing 
Member.
91
Section 9(b) of GSD Rule 8 
would further provide that terminations 
would be finalized through the creation 
of a Final Net Settlement Position, 
representing the net obligations of the 
parties for each Eligible Netting 
Security.
92
As originally filed, Section 9 
of GSD Rule 8 would allow FICC to 
terminate some or all of the done-with 
Agent Clearing Transactions of an 
Executing Firm Customer. In 
Amendment No. 1, FICC would amend 
Section 9 of GSD Rule 8, as originally 
proposed, to remove FICC’s ability to 
liquidate Agent Clearing Transactions 
under this provision.
93
Unlike 
Sponsored Members, Executing Firm 
Customers are not limited members of 
FICC.
94
Therefore, under the amended 
proposal, FICC would only have the 
ability to settle, close-out, or (if the 
proposed rule change is approved) 
transfer Agent Clearing Transactions in 
the event FICC has ceased to act for an 
Agent Clearing Member.
95
 
Section 9(c) of GSD Rule 8 would 
provide for the calculation and 
settlement of liquidation amounts.
96
 
Specifically, the Executing Firm 
Customer Liquidation Amount and the 
corresponding Agent Clearing Member 
Liquidation Amount would be 
determined based on net positions, 
market prices, and any gains, losses, or 
costs incurred by the Agent Clearing 
Member.
97
Additionally, payments 
would be processed through a 
designated Agent Clearing Funds-Only 
Omnibus Account, with obligations 
automatically set off between FICC and 
the Agent Clearing Member.
98
Section 
9(d) of GSD Rule 8 would require the 
Agent Clearing Member to indemnify 
FICC against any claims by Executing 
Firm Customers challenging the 
liquidation calculations.
99
 
As originally filed, Section 9 of GSD 
Rule 8 describes how Agent Clearing 
Members may liquidate an Executing 
Firm Customer’s done-with Agent 
Clearing Transactions. In Amendment 
No. 1, FICC would amend Section 9 of 
GSD Rule 8, as originally proposed, to 
describe additional mechanisms 
through which Agent Clearing Members 
may liquidate both done-with and done- 
away transactions of Executing Firm 
Customers.
100
FICC proposes to add a 
new Section 9(c) to GSD Rule 8 
regarding the Agent Clearing Service to 
include the same two additional 
liquidation mechanisms (i.e., the Offsetting Transaction Mechanism and 
the Transfer Mechanism, collectively, 
the ‘‘ACM Liquidation Actions’’) that 
FICC proposes to add to GSD Rule 3A 
regarding the Sponsored Service 
described above.
101
 
3. Close-Out Rules for Indirect 
Participant Activity 
FICC proposes to expand the 
descriptions of the procedures set forth 
in GSD Rule 22A that apply following 
a Netting Member Default.
102
 
Specifically, Section 2(a) of GSD Rule 
22A would exclude from scope any 
Sponsored Member Trades or Agent 
Clearing Transactions that FICC 
determines to settle pursuant to GSD 
Rule 3A or GSD Rule 8.
103
Section 2(b) 
of GSD Rule 22A would address how 
FICC would close-out Indirect 
Participant activity.
104
These provisions 
would apply the close-out procedures to 
positions recorded in an Indirect 
Participants Account and specify how 
Final Net Settlement Positions would be 
determined, permitting FICC to net 
positions on an Indirect Participant-by 
Indirect Participant (i.e., gross) basis and across Executing Firm Customers in 
a manner consistent with the proposed 
parallel provisions in GSD Rules 3A and 
8 described above.
105
 
Additionally, FICC proposes to amend 
GSD Rule 22A to refine its authority to 
take market action on each Final Net 
Settlement Position of a Defaulting 
Member, including the discretion to 
decline to take market action when a 
Final Net Settlement Position has 
opposite directionality to another 
position established in the same 
security for the Defaulting Member or its 
Indirect Participants.
106
In such 
circumstances, FICC would determine 
the value of the positions through other 
market actions or by reference to 
available market data.
107
 
FICC also proposes to clarify that 
Indirect Participants may, but are not 
obligated to, take market action to close- 
out any outstanding positions that FICC 
determines to close-out pursuant to GSD 
Rule 3A or GSD Rule 8.
108
In 
Amendment No. 1, FICC would clarify 
its treatment of market action by 
Indirect Participants.
109
Specifically, 
Amendment No. 1 would amend GSD 
Rule 22A to provide that, with respect 
to any market action taken by an 
Indirect Participant, FICC will not 
require the Indirect Participant to report 
the data on any such market action to 
FICC (except to the extent otherwise set

forth in the GSD Rules).
110
Additionally, 
FICC will not incorporate such data into 
its calculation of any amount owing by 
or to the Defaulting Member or Indirect 
Participant to any greater extent than it 
would have done so in the absence of 
the statement proposed to be added to 
GSD Rule 22A by the proposed rule 
change.
111
 
FICC further proposes to expand the 
existing provision that allows FICC to 
offset losses with gains, which currently 
applies only to a Defaulting Member’s 
Market Professional Cross-Margining 
Account, to provide that FICC may use 
gains realized from closing-out a 
Defaulting Member’s Proprietary 
Transactions to offset losses associated 
with the close-out of Indirect Participant 
activity.
112
Finally, GSD Rule 22A 
would specify that FICC would include, 
without limitation, all costs and fees 
incurred in closing-out Final Net 
Settlement Positions when determining 
any resulting loss or liability, without 
changing FICC’s existing rights or 
obligations.
113
 
4. Default Management Rules Governing 
a Corporation Default 
FICC proposes to amend GSD Rule 
22A to clarify how Indirect Participant 
activity would be treated in the event of 
a Corporation Default.
114
Specifically, 
GSD Rule 22B would apply to all 
Sponsored Member Trades and Agent 
Clearing Transactions, and the phrase 
‘‘each relevant Member’’ would include 
Sponsored Members.
115
Additionally, 
only Members with outstanding 
Novated Transactions would be 
required to take market action.
116
 
Sponsored Members may appoint 
Sponsoring Members as agent to act on 
their behalf, and Agent Clearing 
Members may act for their Executing 
Firm Customers unless otherwise 
agreed.
117
Either the Member or its 
agent would report market action results 
to FICC’s Board.
118
 
FICC also proposes to expand GSD 
Rule 22B to clarify how net amounts 
payable to or from a Member would be 
calculated.
119
Indirect Participant 
claims would not be netted against 
amounts owed by their Sponsoring 
Member or Agent Clearing Member.
120
 
Activity in Agent Clearing Member 
Omnibus Accounts (excluding 
Segregated Indirect Participant 
Accounts) would be netted across all 
Executing Firm Customers.
121
Activity 
in Sponsoring Member Omnibus 
Accounts and Segregated Indirect 
Participant Accounts would be netted 
on an Indirect Participant-by-Indirect 
Participant (i.e., gross) basis.122
Multiple 
net amounts may be calculated for a 
Netting Member intermediary to reflect 
separate amounts for its Indirect 
Participants.
123
Finally, FICC proposes 
to make corresponding changes to 
Section 17(a) (re-numbered Section 
15(a)) of GSD Rule 3A to ensure 
payments to Sponsored Members 
following a Corporation Default would 
be made on a net basis for each 
Sponsored Member and Segregated 
Indirect Participant.
124
 
5. Porting Indirect Participant Activity 
FICC proposes to adopt a new GSD 
Rule 26 that would describe the process 
by which an Indirect Participant’s 
activity and, when applicable, 
Segregated Customer Margin, could be 
transferred between Sponsoring 
Members or Agent Clearing Members, 
both in the normal course of business 
and following the default of a 
Sponsoring Member or Agent Clearing 
Member.
125
 
Porting in the Normal Course of 
Business 
Section 1 of GSD Rule 26 would 
govern the transfer of an Indirect 
Participant’s activity and, where 
applicable, Segregated Customer Margin 
between Sponsoring Members or Agent 
Clearing Members in the normal course 
of business.
126
Section 1 of GSD Rule 26 
would permit the transfer of all or part 
of an Indirect Participant’s activity from 
a Sending Member (i.e., the originating Sponsoring Member or Agent Clearing 
Member) to a Receiving Member (i.e., 
the recipient Sponsoring Member or 
Agent Clearing Member).
127
Indirect 
Participants would only be able to 
transfer activity within the same type of 
Indirect Participants Account.
128
A 
Sending Member would submit the 
trades to FICC’s real-time trade 
matching system, and the Receiving 
Member would be deemed to accept the 
transfer by submitting matching data by 
the published deadline.
129
Transfers 
submitted by the deadline would be 
effective by the close of business on that 
day, while later submissions would take 
effect the following business day.
130
 
Section 1 of GSD Rule 26 would 
establish conditions for the transfer of 
Indirect Participant Activity, including 
(1) the Indirect Participant has 
completed onboarding with the 
Receiving Member, (2) the trades have 
been novated but not yet included in a 
Net Settlement Position, and (3) the 
Sending Member and Receiving Member 
have submitted and accepted the 
required trade data.
131
FICC would 
maintain its lien on the Sending 
Member’s Clearing Fund and, where 
applicable, Segregated Customer Margin 
until the Receiving Member satisfies the 
relevant margin requirements.
132
 
Additionally, Section 1 of GSD Rule 
26 would establish conditions necessary 
for a Sending Member to transfer the 
Segregated Customer Margin deposits of 
a Segregated Indirect Participant to a 
Receiving Member.
133
Such conditions 
include that (1) all of the activity of the 
Segregated Indirect Participant is 
transferred from the Sending Member to 
a Segregated Indirect Participants 
Account of the Receiving Member, (2) 
the Sending Member has identified to 
FICC the cash deposit and Eligible 
Clearing Fund Securities to be 
transferred to the Receiving Member, 
and (3) the transfer is submitted to FICC 
in accordance within the applicable 
timeframes.
134
FICC would not process 
the transfer of Segregated Customer 
Margin if any of the foregoing 
conditions are not met.
135
 
Porting Following a Sponsoring Member 
or Agent Clearing Member Default 
Section 2 of GSD Rule 26 would 
govern the transfer of Indirect 
Participant activity and, where 
applicable, Segregated Customer 
Margin, following the default of a 
Sponsoring Member or Agent Clearing 
Member.
136
Subject to applicable law,

152
15 U.S.C. 78q–1(b)(3)(F). 
153
See Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 19b–4 thereunder. 
FICC would attempt to transfer all or 
part of the Defaulting Member’s Indirect 
Participant transactions to alternate 
Sponsoring Members or Agent Clearing 
Members.
137
FICC would retain 
discretion over such transfers, 
recognizing that circumstances such as 
bankruptcy court orders could limit 
FICC’s ability to transfer activity, but the 
provisions would document in the GSD 
Rules FICC’s intention to effect such 
transfers when possible and 
appropriate.
138
 
Section 2 of GSD Rule 26 would also 
provide that FICC’s lien on a Defaulting 
Member’s Clearing Fund would 
continue to secure the obligations of any 
transferred activity until the Receiving 
Member meets the required Sponsoring 
Member or Agent Clearing Member 
omnibus account deposits.
139
This 
provision would enable FICC to 
continue to manage the risks of such 
transferred activity.
140
 
As originally filed, Section 2 of GSD 
Rule 26 does not define what constitutes 
a ‘‘default’’ of a Netting Member 
intermediary that may result in 
involuntary porting of Indirect 
Participant positions. In Amendment 
No. 1, FICC would clarify that proposed 
Section 2 of GSD Rule 26 would apply 
in the event FICC ceases to act for a 
Sponsoring Member or Agent Clearing 
Member under the GSD Rules.
141
 
Amendment No. 1 would also clarify 
that any transfer under Section 2 of GSD 
Rule 26 would require the consent of 
the Receiving Member.
142
 
6. Technical Updates and Corrections 
FICC proposes several non- 
substantive technical changes and 
corrections to the GSD Rules.
143
FICC 
proposes to add a defined term for 
‘‘Indirect Participant’’ to GSD Rule 1 
that would refer to any Sponsored 
Member or Executing Firm Customer.
144
 
FICC also proposes to add a reference to 
proposed GSD Rule 26 in Section 17(b) 
(re-numbered Section 15(b)) of GSD 
Rule 3A applicable to Sponsoring 
Members and Sponsored Members.
145
 
Additionally, FICC proposes to change 
existing references to the term 
‘‘Member’’ in GSD Rule 22A to 
‘‘Defaulting Member’’ for accuracy.
146
 
FICC proposes to create additional 
subsections in Section 2 of GSD Rule 
22A to improve its readability.
147
 
Finally, FICC would make a 
grammatical correction to Section 14(a) 
of GSD Rule 3A, correct a section 
reference in Section 18(e) (re-numbered 
Section 16(e)) of GSD Rule 3A, correct 
a typographical error in Section 2(b) of 
GSD Rule 8, and remove an unnecessary 
heading at the top of GSD Rule 22B.
148
 
II. Discussion and Commission 
Findings 
Section 19(b)(2)(C) of the Exchange 
Act
149
directs the Commission to 
approve a proposed rule change of a 
self-regulatory organization if it finds 
that such proposed rule change is 
consistent with the requirements of the 
Exchange Act and rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to such 
organization. After carefully considering 
the proposed rule change, as modified 
by Amendment No. 1, the Commission 
finds that the proposed rule change, as 
modified by Amendment No. 1, is 
consistent with the requirements of the 
Exchange Act and the rules and 
regulations thereunder applicable to 
FICC. In particular, the Commission 
finds that the proposed rule change, as 
modified by Amendment No. 1, is 
consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of 
the Exchange Act
150
and Rules 17ad– 
22(e)(13), (e)(18)(iv)(C), (e)(19), and 
(e)(23)(i) thereunder.
151
 
A. Consistency With Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) 
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Exchange 
Act requires that the rules of a clearing 
agency, such as FICC, be designed to, 
among other things, promote the prompt 
and accurate clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions, and assure the 
safeguarding of securities and funds 
which are in the control of the clearing 
agency or for which it is responsible, 
and protect investors and the public 
interest.
152
 
As described above in Section I.B., 
FICC proposes to expand the default 
management provisions in the GSD 
Rules applicable to the Sponsored 
Service and Agent Clearing Service to 
more fully address the default scenarios 
of Netting Member intermediaries, 
Indirect Participants, and FICC. 
Additionally, FICC proposes to add 
provisions to the GSD Rules that govern 
the porting of Indirect Participant 
activity between intermediary Netting 
Members, both in the normal course of 
business and following the default of an 
intermediary. Finally, FICC proposes 
several non-substantive technical 
updates and corrections to the GSD 
Rules. 
As described above in Section I.B., 
FICC proposes changes to the GSD Rules 
that are designed to encourage and 
facilitate the utilization of GSD’s 
clearance and settlement services by a 
greater number of market participants 
for transactions in U.S. Treasury 
securities, including for done-with and 
done-away transactions. Specifically, 
the proposed changes to adopt and 
expand the default management 
provisions in the GSD Rules would 
encourage participation in central 
clearing by improving market 
participants’ understanding of FICC’s 
default management procedures 
applicable to indirect access models and 
should help market participants better 
evaluate the fitness of such models for 
their individual needs. Currently, the 
GSD rules do not address the default of 
an Agent Clearing Member. These 
proposed changes should make clear 
how such a default would be 
administered. Additionally, the 
proposed changes to adopt rules that 
would govern porting Indirect 
Participant activity between 
intermediary Netting Members would 
further encourage participation in 
central clearing by providing market 
participants with a useful tool to 
manage their clearing relationships and 
trading activity. 
The proposed changes should help 
extend the benefits of central clearing to 
a broader segment of the market, 
particularly to firms that would offer or 
participate through FICC’s indirect 
access models. Bringing more securities 
transactions into central clearing would 
promote the prompt and accurate 
clearance and settlement of such 
transactions, providing benefits to FICC, 
FICC’s participants, and the broader 
market. To the extent that the proposed 
changes would encourage greater 
participation in central clearing and 
improved understanding of the default 
management processes at FICC, the 
overall amount of counterparty credit 
risk in the securities markets would 
decrease. FICC would be able to risk- 
manage more transactions centrally, 
pursuant to risk management 
procedures that the Commission has 
reviewed and approved,
153

A covered clearing agency, such as FICC, is 
required to establish, implement, maintain and 
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably 
designed to, as applicable, ensure that it has the 
authority and operational capacity to contain losses 
and liquidity demands and continue to meet its 
obligations, which must be tested annually, and 
publicly disclose all relevant rules and material 
procedures, including key aspects of its default 
rules and procedures. See Rule 17ad–22(e)(13) and (e)(23)(i). See also Covered Clearing Agency Standards Proposing Release, Exchange Act Release

management procedures would provide certainty

done-away trades would be treated as subject to a

a precondition to obtaining favorable netting and 
regulatory capital treatment; and make it more

165
See FICC Letter at 7, supra note 6. would guarantee trade settlement in the 
event of a default. 
Additionally, more central clearing 
would help market participants avoid 
potential disorderly default scenarios. A 
CCP, which has guaranteed both sides of 
a trade, is uniquely positioned to 
coordinate a defaulting participant’s 
trades. The CCP’s non-defaulting 
participants can rely on the CCP to 
complete the defaulting participant’s 
trades and cover any resulting losses 
using the defaulting participant’s 
resources and/or other default 
management tools. By contrast, defaults 
in bilaterally settled trades are likely to 
be less orderly and subject to variable 
default management techniques because 
bilaterally settled trades are not subject 
to default management processes that 
are required to be in place and publicly 
disclosed by a CCP, such as FICC.
154
 
Moreover, the increased specificity 
regarding FICC’s default management 
processes should promote prompt and 
accurate clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions by ensuring that 
FICC and its participants can manage a 
default smoothly and with less risk to 
the market. 
CCP rules that are clear, 
comprehensible, and more effectively 
describe the CCP’s risk management 
procedures to market participants 
should encourage a broader scope of 
market participants to utilize the CCP’s 
services, thereby promoting the prompt 
and accurate clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions, and protecting 
investors and the public interest, 
consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of 
the Exchange Act.
155
The proposed rule 
change, as modified by Amendment No. 
1, is consistent with those objectives 
because improving market participants’ 
understanding of FICC’s default 
management procedures and providing 
market participants with porting tools to 
manage their clearing relationships and 
trading activity would encourage greater 
participation in central clearing, thereby 
ensuring that a greater proportion of 
securities transactions are subject to the 
risk mitigation benefits of central 
clearing described above. 
Moreover, the proposed changes to 
adopt and expand the default 
management provisions in the GSD 
Rules would provide clarity to better 
prepare market participants to deal with 
a participant default, resulting in a more 
orderly management of such an event, 
minimizing default losses and reducing 
potential risk to FICC and its non- 
defaulting participants. Accordingly, the 
proposed changes would ensure the 
safeguarding of securities and funds in 
FICC’s custody or control, consistent 
with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the 
Exchange Act.
156
 
Finally, FICC’s proposed technical 
updates and corrections to the GSD 
Rules would promote the prompt and 
accurate clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions and protect 
investors and the public interest by 
ensuring that the GSD Rules are clear 
and comprehensible, which would 
enable market participants to readily 
understand their rights and obligations 
in connection with FICC’s clearance and 
settlement services.

1. Comments on Default Management 
Provisions for Done-Away Trades 
As described above in Section I.B., the 
proposed rule change, as originally 
filed, would include default 
management provisions explicitly in the 
GSD Rules for cleared done-with trades. 
In that regard, commenters support the 
proposed rule change.
158
 
However, commenters request that 
FICC amend the proposed rule change 
to provide liquidation mechanisms in 
the GSD Rules for cleared done-away 
trades as well.
159
One such commenter 
states that FICC should amend the GSD 
Rules to provide default procedures and 
close-out rules for done-away trading 
similar to those already established by 
derivatives clearing organizations, 
where done-away clearing is the 
norm.
160
The commenter requests that 
FICC amend the GSD Rules to expressly 
permit Netting Member intermediaries 
to either settle, transfer, liquidate, or 
offset a defaulting customer’s done- 
away trades.
161
 
Although FICC disagrees that the 
absence of express language in the GSD 
Rules regarding a Netting Member 
intermediary’s ability to liquidate a 
customer’s done-away trades precludes 
intermediaries from engaging in done- 
away clearing,
162
FICC acknowledges 
that adding such provisions to the GSD 
Rules can further facilitate done-away 
clearing by providing market 
participants with greater clarity on the 
subject.
163
Accordingly, in Amendment 
No. 1 to the proposed rule change, FICC 
proposes to amend the GSD Rules to 
expressly provide for done-away 
clearing.
164
As described above in 
Section I.B., FICC proposes to add 
language to the GSD Rules that 
describes the SMP Liquidation Actions 
that Netting Member intermediaries may 
take to liquidate done-away 
transactions, i.e., the Offsetting Transaction Mechanism and the 
Transfer Mechanism. FICC states that 
the Offsetting Transaction Mechanism is 
the principal means that clearing 
members at other CCPs have historically 
used to liquidate done-away customer 
positions.
165
FICC states that the 
Transfer Mechanism is an alternative

See id. (describing situations in which a 
customer’s portfolio is too large and complex, such 
that transferring the portfolio to the clearing 
member’s proprietary account would enable the 
clearing member to use portfolio hedges and macro-

which the customer is from a jurisdiction where the 
legal regime does not clearly support an offsetting 
mechanism).

Continued 
preferred by market participants in 
certain circumstances.
166
 
FICC states that it is not necessary, at 
this time, to describe additional 
liquidation mechanisms in the GSD 
Rules to facilitate done-away 
clearing.
167
Regarding the commenter’s 
specific requests (e.g., liquidation via settlement), FICC states that the 
commenter has not described how such 
mechanisms would function or what 
use-case such mechanisms would 
serve.
168
FICC acknowledges the 
possibility that other mechanisms may 
be necessary or beneficial to provide 
market participants with greater 
flexibility or to address particular 
regulatory or operational 
requirements.
169
However, before 
proposing an additional liquidation 
mechanism in the GSD Rules, FICC cites 
the need to ensure that it has the 
operational capacity to support such 
mechanism and an understanding of 
how the mechanism would operate from 
a risk-management, legal, operational, 
and practical perspective.
170
 
The proposed changes in Amendment 
No. 1 to include explicit liquidation 
provisions for done-away transactions 
in the GSD Rules largely address the 
commenters’ requests.
171
The 
Commission agrees that the proposed 
changes in Amendment No. 1 provide 
greater clarity and certainty to enable 
market participants to offer and engage 
in done-away clearing. 
Additionally, the Commission agrees 
that FICC need not amend the GSD 
Rules to include additional liquidation 
mechanisms for done-away transactions 
at this time. First, express liquidation 
provisions are not necessary to permit 
Netting Member intermediaries to effect 
transactions otherwise permitted under 
the GSD Rules. As cited by FICC above, 
the GSD Rules currently permit a 
Netting Member intermediary to 
liquidate a customer’s positions by 
entering into offsetting transactions in 
the customer’s account or settling a 
customer’s transactions.
172
Second, 
FICC expresses a willingness to consider 
adding other liquidation mechanisms to 
the GSD Rules in the future, based on 
fully developed use-cases and analyses 
of the risk-management, legal, 
operational, and practical implications 
of such mechanisms.
173
The 
Commission shall approve a proposed 
rule change of a self-regulatory 
organization if it finds that the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
Exchange Act and the rules 
thereunder.
174
The absence of 
additional done-away liquidation 
mechanisms from the GSD Rules does 
not render the proposed rule change 
inconsistent with the Exchange Act or 
the rules thereunder. 
One commenter requests that FICC 
amend the GSD Rules to contain 
provisions allowing Netting Member 
intermediaries to engage in any 
liquidation mechanism without the 
consent of a defaulting customer. In 
response, FICC states that the bilateral 
agreement between the Netting Member 
and its customer should govern such 
terms between the parties, not the GSD 
Rules.
175
 
The Commission agrees that FICC 
need not amend the GSD Rules to 
expressly permit Netting Member 
intermediaries to liquidate customer 
positions without customer consent. 
Market participants should generally 
have the flexibility to determine the 
negotiable aspects of their relationships 
in their bilateral agreements.
176
 
Commenters also request that FICC 
amend the GSD Rules to clarify that a 
Netting Member intermediary acts as 
principal (i.e., not as agent) for a defaulting customer when the Netting 
Member intermediary closes-out or 
otherwise takes action with respect to 
the defaulting customer’s trades.
177
 
Commenters state that this clarification 
would ensure the enforceability of the 
Netting Member’s remedies across an 
array of jurisdictions.
178
 
In response, FICC states that whether 
a Netting Member intermediary acts as 
an agent for its customer or as principal 
generally depends on the bilateral 
agreement and substance of the 
relationship between the two parties, 
not on the views or intent of a third 
party, such as FICC.
179
To support its 
position, FICC cites the absence of such 
provisions from other CCP rulebooks.
180
 
Additionally, FICC notes that the 
Accounting Committee Working Group 
of the Securities Industry and Financial 
Markets Association (‘‘SIFMA’’) recently 
published a white paper to facilitate 
market participants’ accounting 
analyses of FICC-cleared transactions 
including done-away trades.
181
The 
Accounting White Paper’s conclusions 
are premised on certain assumptions 
and understandings regarding the 
capacity in which an Agent Clearing 
Member acts when submitting, carrying, 
and clearing Agent Cleared Transactions 
and the terms contained in the bilateral 
agreement between the Agent Clearing 
Member and its Executing Firm 
Customer.
182
FICC states that it would 
not be appropriate or consistent with 
FICC’s regulatory requirements to 
prescribe capacity requirements that 
could disrupt or raise a question about 
a Netting Member intermediary’s ability 
to structure its relationship in a manner 
consistent with the Accounting White 
Paper.
183
 
The Commission agrees that FICC 
need not amend the GSD Rules to 
expressly provide that a Netting 
Member acts as principal (i.e., not as agent) when liquidating a customer’s 
transactions. Market participants should 
generally have the flexibility to 
determine the negotiable aspects of their 
relationships in their bilateral 
agreements.
184
This is consistent with

enable customers to access central 
clearing.
185
 
2. Comments on ‘‘Market Action’’ in 
Close-Out Scenarios 
As described above in Section I.B., the 
proposed rule change, as originally 
filed, would amend GSD Rule 22A to 
clarify that FICC’s right to take market 
action with respect to each Final Net 
Settlement Position of a Defaulting 
Member would include the right to 
decline to take market action to the 
extent that such position has opposite 
directionality to another position 
established in the same security for the 
Defaulting Member or its Indirect 
Participants. One commenter supports 
this clarification to the extent it 
provides greater detail regarding FICC’s 
default management procedures.
186
 
However, the commenter notes that 
the term ‘‘market action’’ is not a 
defined term in the GSD Rules.
187
 
Additionally, the proposed rule change, 
as originally filed, would amend GSD 
Rule 22A to allow—but not require—the 
Indirect Participants of a Defaulting 
Netting Member intermediary to take 
market action to close-out any 
outstanding positions that FICC has 
determined to close-out. The commenter 
states that without defining the term 
‘‘market action,’’ the proposed rule 
change creates confusion and could 
create a chaotic wind-down process.
188
 
The commenter states that FICC’s use of 
the Indirect Participant’s market actions 
to determine the price of closed-out 
securities when FICC calculates Final 
Net Settlement Positions could yield 
inaccurate results and potential losses to 
FICC.
189
Moreover, the commenter 
states that there is no need for the GSD 
Rules to allow Indirect Participants to 
take market action because they are 
already free to do so when such action 
does not otherwise violate the GSD 
Rules.
190
Accordingly, the commenter 
requests that FICC amend the GSD Rules 
to define the term market action to 
clarify the actions that Indirect 
Participants and FICC may take 
pursuant to the relevant provisions of 
GSD Rule 22A.
191
 
FICC agrees that Indirect Participants 
are generally free to utilize cash and 
securities they receive under FICC- 
cleared transactions as they see fit, and 
that the proposed language in GSD Rule 
22A to allow Indirect Participants to 
take market action to close-out positions 
would not alter their rights under the 
GSD Rules.
192
However, FICC states that 
market participants have indicated it 
would be helpful for the GSD Rules to 
specify the circumstances in which an 
Indirect Participant may wish to take 
market action to limit its losses after 
FICC has ceased to act for the Indirect 
Participant’s Netting Member 
intermediary.
193
Additionally, FICC 
states that nothing in the proposed rule 
change would provide for FICC to 
incorporate the results of any market 
action taken by an Indirect Participant 
into FICC’s calculation of any amount 
owing by or to the Defaulting Member, 
contrary to the commenter’s 
concerns.
194
Nonetheless, FICC states 
that adding further clarifying language 
to GSD Rule 22A regarding the 
treatment of market action by Indirect 
Participants would help market 
participants better understand FICC’s 
intent.
195
Accordingly, as described 
above in Section I.B., Amendment No. 
1 to the proposed rule would clarify 
GSD Rule 22A to provide that an 
Indirect Participant shall not (except to 
the extent otherwise set forth in the GSD 
Rules) be required to report the data on 
any market action taken pursuant to 
GSD Rule 22A to FICC, and FICC shall 
not incorporate such data into its 
calculation of any amount owing by or 
to the Defaulting Member or Indirect 
Participant to any greater extent than it 
would in the absence of the explicit 
language in the GSD Rules authorizing 
the Indirect Participant to take such 
market actions. 
Furthermore, FICC states that it would 
not be appropriate or consistent with its 
regulatory obligations to dictate the 
manner in which an Indirect Participant 
may take market action.
196
FICC states 
that based on its engagement with 
market participants, FICC understands 
that the standards to be followed by 
customers when taking market action 
following the default of a Netting 
Member intermediary is a matter that 
market participants may wish to 
negotiate between themselves within 
the context of their bilateral 
agreements.
197
 
The Commission agrees that if 
Indirect Participants have indicated that 
it is not always clear when they may 
wish to take market action to mitigate 
their losses, it is reasonable for FICC to 
clarify GSD Rule 22A to provide that the 
Indirect Participant may—but would not 
be required to—take market action after 
FICC has ceased to act for the Netting 
Member intermediary. Additionally, by 
explicitly clarifying GSD Rule 22A to 
provide that FICC would neither request 
nor use data regarding Indirect 
Participant market action, FICC’s 
proposal in Amendment No. 1 should 
address the commenter’s concern that 
FICC might use such data to determine 
Final Net Settlement Positions following 
a Netting Member intermediary default. 
Finally, consistent with the 
Commission’s position that Netting 
Member intermediaries should have the 
flexibility to determine which risks to 
take when providing their customers 
access to central clearing,
198
the 
Commission agrees that Netting Member 
intermediaries and their customers 
should have the flexibility to determine 
between themselves the allowable types 
of market action Indirect Participants 
may take, rather than FICC prescribing 
a set of standards in the GSD Rules. 
3. Comments on Porting 
As described above in Section I.B., the 
proposed rule change, as originally 
filed, would add provisions to the GSD 
Rules that govern the porting of Indirect 
Participant activity between Netting 
Member intermediaries, both in the 
normal course of business and following 
an intermediary default. One 
commenter generally supports having 
clear, pre-established porting rules and 
arrangements in the GSD Rules.
199
 
However, the commenter states that 
some of the porting provisions, as 
proposed in the original filing, would 
magnify risk for Netting Member

revision.

a. Default Porting; Receiving Member’s 
Consent 
Proposed Section 2 of GSD Rule 26 
(regarding porting following an 
intermediary default), as originally filed, 
would not require a Receiving Member’s 
consent to a Sending Member’s transfer 
of Indirect Participant activity. The 
commenter requests that FICC revise the 
proposed rule change to require, as a 
condition of transfer under Section 2 of 
GSD Rule 26, the Receiving Member’s 
consent to the transfer of the Indirect 
Participant’s activity.
201
This 
clarification would help market 
participants avoid uncertainty and 
ensure that the necessary 
documentation and account structure is 
in place between the Indirect 
Participant and Receiving Member.
202
 
FICC agrees that the commenter’s 
suggestion would provide greater clarity 
regarding its default porting provisions 
and proposes to revise the GSD Rules 
accordingly.
203
Specifically, as 
described above in Section I.B., 
Amendment No. 1 would revise 
proposed Section 2 of GSD Rule 26 to 
clarify that any transfer would require 
the Receiving Member’s consent. The 
Commission agrees that the proposed 
changes in Amendment No. 1 provide 
greater clarity and address the 
commenter’s request. 
b. Indirect Participants Designating 
Preferred Receiving Members 
The commenter requests that FICC 
revise the proposed rule change to 
permit Indirect Participants to 
designate, as a preference, another 
Netting Member intermediary as 
Receiving Member in the event FICC 
chooses to port the Indirect Participant’s 
activity following an intermediary 
default.
204
The commenter states that 
this revision would make porting more 
predictable for Indirect Participants, the 
Receiving Member, and FICC.
205
 
FICC states that before proposing a 
specific mechanism to designate a 
preferred Receiving Member, FICC and 
market participants should engage to 
determine how to structure such a 
mechanism to ensure it achieves its 
intended purpose and the costs would 
not outweigh the benefits.
206
FICC notes 
that it currently does not interface 
directly with Indirect Participants.
207
 
Therefore, FICC would either need to 
build a system to enable an Indirect 
Participant to notify FICC of its 
designation, or FICC would need to 
receive such designation from the 
Indirect Participant’s current Netting 
Member intermediary, which could be 
challenging given the commercially 
sensitive nature of the designation.
208
 
Additionally, FICC states that in a 
default scenario, FICC would likely 
need to transfer the positions of a 
potentially large number of Indirect 
Participants in an extremely short 
timeframe.
209
FICC states that such 
challenges may limit the benefits of 
Indirect Participants designating their 
preferred Receiving Members.
210
 
Nonetheless, FICC states that such 
designations could facilitate either bulk 
or individual transfers to preferred 
Receiving Members, thereby assisting 
FICC in managing a default and 
enabling Indirect Participants to face 
their preferred Receiving Members.
211
 
The Commission shall approve a 
proposed rule change of a self- 
regulatory organization if it finds that 
the proposed rule change is consistent 
with the Exchange Act and the rules 
thereunder.
212
The absence of a 
provision in the GSD Rules allowing 
Indirect Participants to designate their 
preferred Receiving Members would not 
render the proposed rule change 
inconsistent with the Exchange Act or 
the rules thereunder. 
c. Default Porting; All or Part of Indirect 
Participant’s Transactions 
Proposed Section 2 of GSD Rule 26, 
as originally filed, provides that FICC 
may transfer all or part of an Indirect 
Participant’s transactions of a defaulting 
intermediary, along with associated 
Segregated Customer Margin. The 
commenter states that FICC’s transfer of 
some Indirect Participant activity could 
result in a margin deficiency or 
otherwise expose the defaulting 
intermediary to additional loss.
213
 
Accordingly, the commenter requests 
that FICC revise the proposed rule 
change to provide that FICC may only 
transfer Indirect Participant activity to 
the extent it would not result in a 
margin deficiency and would be risk- 
mitigating for the defaulting 
intermediary.
214
 
FICC states that such a restriction on 
its ability to effectuate a transfer is 
unnecessary considering that FICC’s 
regulatory obligations already preclude 
FICC from unnecessarily increasing risk 
to itself or its participants.
215
FICC also 
states that such a restriction is not 
appropriate because managing a default 
requires flexibility.
216
FICC states that 
in light of its regulatory obligations to 
minimize risk,
217
FICC would not 
generally anticipate effectuating porting 
in a way that would result in a margin 
deficiency or otherwise increase risk to 
FICC or a Defaulting Member.
218
 
However, considering the potential 
volatility of a default scenario, FICC 
states it would not be beneficial from a 
risk management perspective to 
constrain its ability to port positions as 
the commenter suggested.
219
Instead, 
FICC states that it needs flexibility 
(within its regulatory guiderails) to 
address unique default scenarios in a 
manner that would limit losses to FICC 
and its participants.
220
 
The Commission shall approve a 
proposed rule change of a self- 
regulatory organization if it finds that 
the proposed rule change is consistent 
with the Exchange Act and the rules 
thereunder.
221
The lack of provisions in 
the GSD Rules that FICC may only 
transfer Indirect Participant activity to 
the extent it would not result in a 
margin deficiency and would be risk- 
mitigating for the defaulting 
intermediary is not inconsistent with 
the Act and the rules thereunder. 
The Commission agrees that FICC’s 
regulatory obligations would generally 
preclude FICC from taking action that 
would unnecessarily cause a 
participant’s margin deficiency or 
otherwise expose the participant to

additional loss.
222
Additionally, Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Exchange Act 
requires that the rules of a clearing 
agency, such as FICC, be designed to, 
among other things, assure the 
safeguarding of securities and funds 
which are in the control of the clearing 
agency or for which it is responsible.
223
 
The Commission agrees that FICC 
should be able to manage a default 
flexibly, consistent with its regulatory 
obligations. 
d. Normal Course Porting; All 
Segregated Customer Margin 
Proposed Section 1(a) of GSD Rule 26 
(regarding voluntary porting in the 
normal course of business), as originally 
filed, provides that all or a portion of an 
Indirect Participant’s activity may be 
ported to a Receiving Member. 
However, proposed Section 1(d) of GSD 
Rule 26 only permits a transfer of 
Segregated Customer Margin if all of the 
Indirect Participant’s activity is ported 
to the Receiving Member. The 
commenter states it does not understand 
why FICC believes all of the activity 
must be ported to effect the transfer of 
Segregated Customer Margin.
224
 
Additionally, the commenter states that 
limiting the ability of an Indirect 
Participant to transfer a portion of its 
Segregated Customer Margin could 
result in delays and uncertainty because 
the Receiving Member would likely 
need to recalculate the associated 
Segregated Customer Margin 
Requirement and send it separately.
225
 
Accordingly, the commenter requests 
that FICC revise the proposed rule 
change to allow the transfer of a portion 
of an Indirect Participant’s Segregated 
Customer Margin.
226
 
In response, FICC notes that 
Segregated Customer Margin is 
calculated on a portfolio basis (i.e., in a way that recognizes risk offsets across 
the Segregated Indirect Participant’s 
positions).
227
As a result, if a portion of 
the Segregated Indirect Participant’s 
positions were ported, the aggregate 
margin requirement for the ported and 
remaining positions would likely 
change.
228
Accordingly, the partial 
transfer of Segregated Customer Margin 
would give rise to complexities 
regarding how to calculate that 
portion.
229
FICC would also need to 
consider the risks to itself and its 
participants, as well as its regulatory 
obligations and potentially significant 
operational changes to FICC’s collateral 
management and risk systems.
230
 
Moreover, FICC disagrees with the 
commenter’s assertion that the 
limitation on partial porting of 
Segregated Customer Margin would 
cause delays due to the need for a 
Receiving Member to recalculate margin 
requirements.
231
First, as explained 
above, the Segregated Customer Margin 
requirement applicable to the ported 
positions would already need to be 
recalculated based on the risk profile of 
the resulting portfolio. Second, FICC 
performs such calculations, not the 
Receiving Member. 
The Commission shall approve a 
proposed rule change of a self- 
regulatory organization if it finds that 
the proposed rule change is consistent 
with the Exchange Act and the rules 
thereunder.
232
The absence of 
provisions in the GSD Rules allowing 
the transfer of a portion of an Indirect 
Participant’s Segregated Customer 
Margin would not render the proposed 
rule change inconsistent with the 
Exchange Act or the rules thereunder. 
e. Excess Segregated Customer Margin 
Proposed Section 1(a) of GSD Rule 26, 
as originally filed, provides for the 
movement of excess Segregated 
Customer Margin from the Sending 
Member to the Receiving Member. The 
commenter states this it is unclear what 
FICC means by ‘‘excess’’ in that 
context.
233
Therefore, the commenter 
requests that FICC revise the proposed 
rule change to remove the word 
‘‘excess’’ and instead, provide that FICC 
will update its books and records to 
reflect the movement of Segregated 
Customer Margin associated with the 
ported activity of the Segregated 
Indirect Participant.
234
 
FICC explains that pursuant to 
proposed Section 1(a) of GSD Rule 26, 
Segregated Customer Margin would 
transfer from Sending Member to 
Receiving Member at the start of the 
Business Day following the Transfer 
Effective Time.
235
At that time, the 
margin would be excess Segregated 
Customer Margin from the perspective 
of the Sending Member.
236
Accordingly, 
FICC states that the word ‘‘excess’’ 
provides important clarity and should 
remain in proposed Section 1(a) of GSD 
Rule 26.
237
 
The Commission agrees that the use of 
the word ‘‘excess’’ provides clarity 
regarding the operation of the proposed 
porting rules. 
f. Transferring Proprietary U.S. Treasury 
Securities 
The commenter notes that a Netting 
Member intermediary is permitted to 
temporarily use proprietary U.S. 
Treasury securities to meet its 
Segregated Customer Margin 
Requirement in accordance with Section 
(b)(1)(iii) of Note H to SEC Rule 15c3– 
3a and Section 3 of GSD Rule 2B. The 
commenter requests that FICC clarify 
that any transfer of Segregated Customer 
Margin pursuant to proposed GSD Rule 
26 would not include such proprietary 
U.S. Treasury securities (or any other 
assets that the SEC may permit Netting 
Member intermediaries to use 
temporarily for purposes of Note H).
238
 
FICC states that such a prohibition 
would not be appropriate because it 
would constrain the ability of Netting 
Member intermediaries and their 
customers to agree bilaterally upon the 
circumstances and conditions of a 
transfer.
239
As an example, FICC cites 
the SIFMA Treasury Clearing 
Agreement, which provides flexibility 
for intermediaries and their customers 
to agree on porting provisions, 
including limitations on the ability of 
customers to transfer prefunded 
margin.
240
FICC also notes that other 
major U.S. CCP rulebooks do not 
prescribe such limitations.
241
 
Additionally, as noted above, proposed 
Section 1(d) of GSD Rule 26 would not 
allow partial transfers of Segregated 
Customer Margin. Therefore, a 
requirement that the entirety of 
transferred Segregated Customer Margin 
consist of Indirect Participant assets 
could limit or eliminate the ability of 
Indirect Participants to port their 
Segregated Customer Margin.
242
Finally, 
FICC states that imposing the 
commenter’s requested limitation would 
require a significant operational build 
because FICC currently does not track 
whether Segregated Customer Margin 
contains such proprietary securities.
243
 
The Commission shall approve a 
proposed rule change of a self- 
regulatory organization if it finds that

Rules (e.g., GSD Rule 22A, proposed GSD Rule 26), pursuant to which FICC may cease to act for an 
Agent Clearing Member. See id. 
the proposed rule change is consistent 
with the Exchange Act and the rules 
thereunder.
244
The absence of 
provisions in the GSD Rules precluding 
the transfer of proprietary U.S. Treasury 
securities as Segregated Customer 
Margin would not render the proposed 
rule change inconsistent with the 
Exchange Act or the rules thereunder. 
g. Timing of Receiving Member’s Margin 
Obligations 
Proposed Section 1(c) of GSD Rule 26, 
as originally filed, provides that a 
Sending Member’s Clearing Fund and 
Segregated Customer Margin will 
continue to secure obligations arising 
from transferred Indirect Participant 
activity until the Receiving Member 
satisfies those requirements. The 
commenter expresses concern that the 
Sending Member would be required to 
fund the Receiving Member’s margin 
obligations with respect to the 
transferred activity despite no longer 
carrying such activity.
245
Therefore, the 
commenter requests that FICC revise the 
proposed rule change to provide that the 
transfer of Indirect Participant activity is 
conditional on the Receiving Member’s 
posting sufficient margin to support the 
transferred activity by the Transfer 
Effective Time.
246
 
FICC states that such a condition 
would not be appropriate because it 
would constrain the ability of Netting 
Member intermediaries and their 
customers to agree bilaterally upon the 
circumstances and conditions of a 
transfer.
247
While intermediaries may 
prefer the commenter’s condition, FICC 
explains that a customer may not, 
because waiting for the Receiving 
Member to post margin could delay the 
transfer, thereby diminishing the utility 
of the porting provisions.
248
FICC states 
that such matters should be determined 
bilaterally between the parties based on 
their commercial, operational, 
regulatory, and risk requirements.
249
 
The Commission shall approve a 
proposed rule change of a self- 
regulatory organization if it finds that 
the proposed rule change is consistent 
with the Exchange Act and the rules 
thereunder.
250
The absence of 
provisions in the GSD Rules precluding 
the transfer of proprietary U.S. Treasury 
securities as Segregated Customer 
Margin would not render the proposed 
rule change inconsistent with the 
Exchange Act or the rules thereunder. 
h. Defaulting Member Status 
Proposed Section 2 of GSD Rule 26, 
as originally filed, does not define what 
constitutes a ‘‘default’’ of a Netting 
Member intermediary that may result in 
involuntary porting of Indirect 
Participant positions. The commenter 
requests that FICC revise the proposed 
rule change to clarify that Section 2 of 
rule 26 would only apply in the event 
a Netting Member intermediary is a 
Defaulting Member as defined in the 
GSD Rules.
251
 
FICC agrees that the commenter’s 
suggestion would provide greater clarity 
regarding its default porting provisions 
and proposes to revise the GSD Rules 
accordingly.
252
Specifically, as 
described above in Section I.B., 
Amendment No. 1 would revise the 
proposed rule change to clarify that 
Section 2 of GSD Rule 26 would apply 
in the event FICC ceases to act for a 
Netting Member intermediary. The 
Commission agrees that the proposed 
changes in Amendment No. 1 provide 
greater clarity and address the 
commenter’s request. 
4. Other Comments 
a. FICC Liquidation of Agent Clearing 
Transactions 
As described above in Section I.B., 
proposed Section 9 of GSD Rule 8, as 
originally filed, would allow FICC to 
terminate some or all of the done-with 
Agent Clearing Transactions of an 
Executing Firm Customer, provided that 
the Agent Clearing Member is not a 
Defaulting Member, FICC has not ceased 
to act for the Agent Clearing Member, 
and a Corporation Default has not 
occurred. In contrast, the parallel 
provision in GSD Rule 3A regarding the 
Sponsored Service allows FICC to 
terminate the done-with Sponsored 
Member Trades if similar conditions are 
met, plus the additional condition that 
the Sponsoring Member has not 
performed its obligations under the 
Sponsoring Member Guaranty.
253
In the 
Notice of Filing, FICC explains that it 
did not propose a similar limitation in 
proposed Section 9 of GSD Rule 8 
because there is no equivalent to the 
Sponsoring Member Guaranty in the 
Agent Clearing Service.
254
 
One commenter expresses concern 
that FICC’s discretion to liquidate done- 
with Agent Clearing Transactions is too 
broad.
255
Therefore, the commenter 
requests that FICC revise the proposed 
rule change to provide that FICC shall 
only have the right to terminate the 
positions of an Executing Firm 
Customer if (1) FICC has provided the 
notice described in proposed Section 
3(h) of GSD Rule 8, and (2) the Agent 
Clearing Member has not performed its 
obligations relating to the Agent 
Clearing Transactions done on behalf of 
that Executing Firm Customer.
256
 
Additionally, the commenter states 
FICC should not have the ability to 
terminate ‘‘some or all’’ of the positions 
of an Executing Firm Customer, even if 
FICC revises the proposed rule change 
to include the commenter’s requested 
limitation above, because FICC’s 
termination of some positions could 
result in the Agent Clearing Member 
facing a margin deficiency or other form 
of loss.
257
Accordingly, the commenter 
requests that FICC revise proposed 
Section 9 of GSD Rule 8 to provide that 
FICC is permitted to terminate ‘‘all, but 
not fewer than all,’’ of the positions of 
an Executing Firm Customer.
258
 
FICC responds that its intent in 
proposed Section 9 of GSD Rule 8 was 
for the liquidation mechanism to be 
available exclusively to Agent Clearing 
Members, not FICC.
259
Accordingly, as 
described above in Section I.B., 
Amendment No. 1 would revise the 
proposed rule change to remove the 
language allowing FICC to trigger a 
termination under Section 9 of GSD 
Rule 8. The Commission agrees that the 
proposed changes in Amendment No. 1 
address the commenter’s concern. 
b. Intermediary Ability To Liquidate 
Some or All Positions 
As described above in Section I.B., 
proposed Section 9 of GSD Rule 8, as 
originally filed, would allow an Agent 
Clearing Member to terminate some or 
all of the done-with Agent Clearing 
Transactions of an Executing Firm 
Customer and corresponding positions 
in the Agent Clearing Member’s Dealer 
Account. However, the parallel 
provision in Section 18(b) of GSD Rule 
3A currently allows a Sponsoring 
Member to terminate all, but not fewer 
than all, of a Sponsored Member’s 
positions and corresponding positions

260
One commenter notes that 
FICC provides no explanation for this 
distinction between the Sponsored 
Service and Agent Clearing Service.
261
 
The commenter states that the flexibility 
to close-out some or all of an Indirect 
Participant’s positions would benefit 
both types of Netting Member 
intermediaries.
262
Accordingly, the 
commenter requests that FICC revise 
Section 18(b) of GSD Rule 3A to allow 
a Sponsoring Member to terminate some 
or all of a Sponsored Member’s 
positions.
263
 
FICC agrees that the flexibility in 
proposed Section 9 of GSD Rule 8 that 
would allow an Agent Clearing Member 
to liquidate some or all Agent Clearing 
Transactions should also be available to 
Sponsoring Members.
264
Accordingly, 
as described above in Section I.B., 
Amendment No. 1 would revise Section 
18 (re-numbered Section 16) of GSD 
Rule 3A to provide Sponsoring 
Members the ability to liquidate some or 
all of the relevant Sponsored Member 
Trades. The Commission agrees that the 
proposed changes in Amendment No. 1 
address the commenter’s request. 
c. Offsetting Agent Clearing 
Transactions and Sponsored Member 
Trades 
One commenter notes that an Indirect 
Participant could be the customer of a 
Netting Member intermediary under 
both the Sponsored Service and the 
Agent Clearing Service.
265
When such 
an Indirect Participant has amounts 
owing to or by FICC, the commenter 
states that to offset such amounts would 
be consistent with FICC’s default 
management goals.
266
The commenter 
requests that FICC revise the GSD Rules 
to allow a Netting Member intermediary 
to offset an Executing Firm Customer’s 
Liquidation Amount against a 
Sponsored Member Liquidation Amount 
with respect to the same Indirect 
Participant.
267
 
FICC disagrees and states that the 
ability of a Netting Member 
intermediary to net amounts owed 
between Agent Clearing Transactions 
and Sponsored Member Trades is not 
relevant to FICC’s default management 
because FICC risk manages those 
portfolios separately and FICC’s netting 
rights are independent of those of the 
intermediary.
268
Additionally, FICC 
states that whether or not an 
intermediary may net such amounts is 
a question that should be resolved 
between the intermediary and its 
customer in their bilateral agreement.
269
 
Specifically, the parties should 
determine between themselves whether 
the intermediary may look to one 
portfolio of positions to satisfy the 
obligations arising from a separate 
portfolio based on the parties’ respective 
legal, credit, regulatory, commercial, 
and other considerations.
270
FICC does 
not believe it should prescribe rules that 
would prevent market participants from 
resolving such issues bilaterally.
271
 
The Commission shall approve a 
proposed rule change of a self- 
regulatory organization if it finds that 
the proposed rule change is consistent 
with the Exchange Act and the rules 
thereunder.
272
The absence of 
provisions in the GSD Rules for netting 
amounts owed between an Indirect 
Participant’s separate portfolios in the 
Agent Clearing Service and the 
Sponsored Service would not render the 
proposed rule change inconsistent with 
the Exchange Act or the rules 
thereunder. 
d. Clarification of Trade Status 
One commenter requests that FICC 
revise the GSD Rule to clarify which 
done-with Sponsored Member Trades 
and Agent Clearing Transactions are 
eligible to be liquidated and which are 
considered settled.
273
For example, the 
commenter states that FICC could 
clarify whether trades of an Indirect 
Participant that are in opposite 
directions on the same CUSIP offset or 
are considered settled (by virtue of their 
offset), and whether a trade is 
considered settled if the Netting 
Member intermediary’s proprietary 
position with FICC originally linked 
with the Indirect Participant has 
settled.
274
 
FICC responds that it does not 
understand what clarification the 
commenter seeks, but FICC expresses a 
willingness to engage further with the 
commenter (and other market 
participants) to address the commenter’s 
specific concern.
275
 
The Commission shall approve a 
proposed rule change of a self- 
regulatory organization if it finds that 
the proposed rule change is consistent 
with the Exchange Act and the rules 
thereunder.
276
The absence of 
clarification in the GSD Rules regarding 
which done-with Sponsored Member 
Trades and Agent Clearing Transactions 
are eligible to be liquidated and which 
are considered settled would not render 
the proposed rule change inconsistent 
with the Exchange Act or the rules 
thereunder. 
e. Remove Reference to Segregated 
Indirect Participants 
As described above in Section I.B., 
proposed Section 14(d)(ii) of GSD Rule 
3A (regarding the close-out of 
Sponsored Member Trades), as 
originally filed, provides that ‘‘if any 
amount is due to a Segregated Indirect 
Participant that is a Sponsored Member, 
the Corporation shall make such 
payment to or as directed by the 
Sponsoring Member or its trustee or 
receiver.’’ One commenter states that 
FICC’s intent is unclear because 
payment to a Segregated Indirect 
Participant that is a Sponsored Member 
would always be directed by the 
Sponsoring Member, its trustee, or 
receiver.
277
Therefore, the commenter 
requests that FICC clarify the intent of 
that provision.
278
 
FICC agrees that if an amount is 
calculated and owing to the Sponsored 
Member, FICC would pay such amount 
to or as directed by the Sponsoring 
Member or its trustee or receiver, 
regardless of whether the Sponsored 
Member is a Segregated Indirect 
Participant.
279
Accordingly, as 
described above in Section I.B., 
Amendment No. 1 would revise Section 
14(d)(ii) of GSD Rule 3A to apply to 
Sponsored Members. The Commission 
agrees that the proposed changes in 
Amendment No. 1 address the 
commenter’s request. 
5. Conclusion 
The proposed rule change, as 
modified by Amendment No. 1, would 
encourage greater participation in 
central clearing by improving market 
participants’ understanding of FICC’s 
default management procedures and 
providing market participants with 
porting tools to manage their clearing 
relationships and trading activity. 
Greater participation in central clearing 
would ensure that more securities 
transactions are subject to the risk 
mitigation benefits of central clearing. 
Accordingly, the proposed rule change, 
as modified by Amendment No. 1, is

consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of 
the Exchange Act because extending the 
benefits of central clearing to more 
securities transactions would ensure the 
prompt and accurate clearance and 
settlement of those transactions.
280
 
Additionally, the proposed rule 
change, as modified by Amendment No. 
1, would better prepare market 
participants to deal with default 
scenarios, resulting in more orderly 
management of such events, minimizing 
default losses and reducing potential 
risk to FICC and its non-defaulting 
participants. Accordingly, the proposed 
rule change, as modified by Amendment 
No. 1, would ensure the safeguarding of 
securities and funds in FICC’s custody 
or control, consistent with Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Exchange Act.
281
 
B. Consistency With Rule 17ad–22(e)(13) 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(13) under the 
Exchange Act requires that a covered 
clearing agency, such as FICC, establish, 
implement, maintain, and enforce 
written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to ensure that the 
covered clearing agency has the 
authority and operational capacity to 
take timely action to contain losses and 
liquidity demands and continue to meet 
its obligations.
282
 
As described above in Section I.B., 
FICC proposes to expand the default 
management provisions in the GSD 
Rules applicable to the Sponsored 
Service and Agent Clearing Service to 
more fully address the default scenarios 
of Netting Member intermediaries, 
Indirect Participants, and FICC. 
Additionally, FICC proposes to add 
provisions to the GSD Rules that govern 
the porting of Indirect Participant 
activity between intermediary Netting 
Members, both in the normal course of 
business and following the default of an 
intermediary. 
Expanding the default management 
provisions in the GSD Rules would 
improve market participants’ 
understanding of FICC’s default 
management procedures. Adding 
provisions to the GSD Rules that govern 
porting would provide market 
participants with useful tools to manage 
their clearing relationships and trading 
activity, including in default scenarios. 
Together, FICC’s proposals would better 
prepare market participants to deal with 
default scenarios, resulting in more 
orderly management of such events, 
minimizing default losses and reducing 
potential risk to FICC and its non- 
defaulting participants. 
Accordingly, the proposed rule 
change, as modified by Amendment No. 
1, is consistent with Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(13) because implementing rules 
that govern default management 
procedures would help ensure that FICC 
has the authority and capacity to take 
timely action to contain losses and 
liquidity demands and continue to meet 
its obligations.
283
 
C. Consistency With Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(18)(iv)(C) 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(18)(iv)(C) under the 
Exchange Act requires that a covered 
clearing agency, such as FICC, establish, 
implement, maintain, and enforce 
written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to establish 
objective, risk-based, and publicly 
disclosed criteria for participation, 
which, when the covered clearing 
agency provides central counterparty 
services for transactions in U.S. 
Treasury securities, ensure that it has 
appropriate means to facilitate access to 
clearance and settlement services of all 
eligible secondary market transactions 
in U.S. Treasury securities, including 
those of indirect participants.
284
 
As described above in Section I.B., 
FICC proposes to expand the default 
management provisions in the GSD 
Rules applicable to the Sponsored 
Service and Agent Clearing Service to 
more fully address the default scenarios 
of Netting Member intermediaries, 
Indirect Participants, and FICC. 
Additionally, FICC proposes to add 
provisions to the GSD Rules that govern 
the porting of Indirect Participant 
activity between intermediary Netting 
Members, both in the normal course of 
business and following the default of an 
intermediary. 
As described above in Section I.A., 
the Commission received comments on 
FICC’s recent access model 
enhancement proposal requesting that 
FICC provide greater detail in the GSD 
Rules regarding the default management 
procedures under the indirect access 
models, including the ability to port 
Indirect Participant positions and 
margin between intermediaries.
285
 
Commenters suggested that the absence 
of GSD Rule provisions that provide 
certainty to market participants 
regarding FICC’s default management 
procedures (including porting) presents 
an obstacle to greater participation in 
central clearing.
286
 
By enhancing the GSD Rules 
regarding the default management 
provisions applicable to FICC’s indirect 
access models, the proposed rule 
change, as modified by Amendment No. 
1, would encourage greater participation 
in central clearing by improving market 
participants’ understanding of how GSD 
would manage a default that may occur 
within GSD’s indirect access models. 
Accordingly, the proposed rule change, 
as modified by Amendment No. 1, is 
consistent with Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(18)(iv)(C) because it would help 
facilitate access to FICC’s clearance and 
settlement services of all eligible 
secondary market transactions in U.S. 
Treasury securities, including those of 
indirect participants.
287
 
D. Consistency With Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(19) 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(19) under the 
Exchange Act requires that a covered 
clearing agency, such as FICC, establish, 
implement, maintain, and enforce 
written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to identify, 
monitor, and manage the material risks 
to the covered clearing agency arising 
from arrangements in which firms that 
are indirect participants in the covered 
clearing agency rely on the services 
provided by direct participants to access 
the covered clearing agency’s payment, 
clearing, or settlement facilities.
288
 
As described above in Section I.B., 
FICC proposes to expand the default 
management provisions in the GSD 
Rules applicable to the Sponsored 
Service and Agent Clearing Service to 
more fully address the default scenarios 
of Netting Member intermediaries, 
Indirect Participants, and FICC. 
Additionally, FICC proposes to add 
provisions to the GSD Rules that govern 
the porting of Indirect Participant 
activity between intermediary Netting 
Members, both in the normal course of 
business and following the default of an 
intermediary. 
Expanding the default management 
provisions in the GSD Rules would 
improve market participants’ 
understanding of FICC’s default 
management procedures. Adding 
provisions to the GSD Rules that govern 
porting would provide market 
participants with useful tools to manage 
their clearing relationships and trading 
activity, including in default scenarios. 
Together, FICC’s proposals would better 
prepare market participants to deal with 
default scenarios, resulting in more 
orderly management of such events, 
minimizing default losses and reducing 
potential risk to FICC and its non- 
defaulting participants.

295
17 CFR 200.30–3(a)(12). 
Accordingly, the proposed rule 
change, as modified by Amendment No. 
1, is consistent with Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(19) because enhancing the GSD 
Rules regarding the default management 
provisions applicable to FICC’s indirect 
access models would better enable FICC 
to manage the material risks arising 
from arrangements in which indirect 
participants rely on direct participants 
to access FICC’s payment, clearing, and 
settlement facilities.
289
 
E. Consistency With Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(23)(i) 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(23)(i) under the 
Exchange Act requires that a covered 
clearing agency, such as FICC, establish, 
implement, maintain, and enforce 
written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to provide for 
publicly disclosing all relevant rules 
and material procedures, including key 
aspects of its default rules and 
procedures.
290
 
As described above in Section I.B., 
FICC proposes to expand the default 
management provisions in the GSD 
Rules applicable to the Sponsored 
Service and Agent Clearing Service to 
more fully address the default scenarios 
of Netting Member intermediaries, 
Indirect Participants, and FICC. 
Additionally, FICC proposes to add 
provisions to the GSD Rules that govern 
the porting of Indirect Participant 
activity between intermediary Netting 
Members, both in the normal course of 
business and following the default of an 
intermediary. 
The proposed rule change, as 
modified by Amendment No. 1, is 
consistent with Rule 17ad–22(e)(23)(i) 
because it would more fully disclose 
key aspects of FICC’s default rules and 
procedures.
291
 
III. Conclusion 
On the basis of the foregoing, the 
Commission finds that the proposed 
rule change, as modified by Amendment 
No. 1, is consistent with the 
requirements of the Exchange Act and 
in particular with the requirements of 
Section 17A of the Exchange Act
292
and 
the rules and regulations promulgated 
thereunder. 
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act

that proposed rule change SR–FICC– 
2025–015, as modified by Amendment 
No. 1, be, and hereby is, approved.

SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD 
[Docket No. FD 36898] 
Mt. Rainier Railroad LLC—Acquisition 
and Change of Operator Exemption— 
City of Tacoma, Department of Public 
Works d/b/a Tacoma Rail Mountain 
Division, and City of Tacoma, 
Department of Public Utilities d/b/a 
Tacoma Rail 
Mt. Rainier Railroad LLC (MRSR), a 
noncarrier, has filed a verified notice of 
exemption under 49 CFR 1150.31 to: (1) 
acquire from the City of Tacoma, Wash., 
Department of Public Works d/b/a 
Tacoma Rail Mountain Division 
(TRMW) and operate approximately 
33.59 miles of rail line extending from 
milepost 32.0M at Eatonville, Wash., to 
milepost 65.59M at Morton, Wash. (the 
Line); and (2) replace the City of 
Tacoma, Department of Public Utilities 
d/b/a Tacoma Rail (Tacoma Rail) as the 
common carrier service provider on the 
Line, thereby terminating Tacoma Rail’s 
common carrier status with respect to 
the Line. 
According to the verified notice, 
MRSR is a subsidiary holding of the 
Western Forest Industries Museum 
(WFIM), and is not affiliated with any 
railroad common carriers.
1
The verified 
notice states that MRSR and TRMW 
have reached an agreement pursuant to 
which MRSR will purchase the Line 
from TRMW and, upon consummation 
of the transaction, assume exclusive 
common carrier operations over the 
Line in place of Tacoma Rail. The 
verified notice, which describes TRMW 
and Tacoma Rail as sister divisions of 
the City of Tacoma, further states that 
Tacoma Rail is a party to the proposed 
transaction and concurs with the 
proposed change of common carrier 
operator on the Line. 
MRSR certifies that it will not be 
contractually limited in its ability to 
interchange traffic with any third-party 
connecting carrier. MRSR further 
certifies that its projected annual 
revenues will not exceed $5 million and 
will not result in MRSR’s becoming a 
Class I or Class II rail carrier. Under 49 
CFR 1150.32(b), a change in operator 
requires that notice be given to shippers. 
MRSR states that there are currently no 
shippers to notify of the transaction and 
explains that the Line is currently 
inactive and has not been used by a 
shipper for over a year. 
The earliest this transaction may be 
consummated is January 4, 2026, the 
effective date of the exemption (30 days 
after the verified notice was filed). 
MRSR states that it will consummate the 
transaction and offer common carrier 
service in place of Tacoma Rail on or 
after this date. 
If the verified notice contains false or 
misleading information, the exemption 
is void ab initio. Petitions to revoke the 
exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10502(d) 
may be filed at any time. The filing of 
a petition to revoke will not 
automatically stay the effectiveness of 
the exemption. Petitions for stay must 
be filed no later than December 26, 2025 
(at least seven days before the 
exemption becomes effective). 
All pleadings, referring to Docket No. 
FD 36898, must be filed with the 
Surface Transportation Board either via 
e-filing on the Board’s website or in 
writing addressed to 395 E Street SW, 
Washington, DC 20423–0001. In 
addition, a copy of each pleading must 
be served on MRSR’s representative, 
Robert A. Wimbish, Fletcher & Sippel 
LLC, 29 North Wacker Drive, Suite 800, 
Chicago, IL 60606–3208. 
According to MRSR, this action is 
categorically excluded from 
environmental review under 49 
CFR1105.6(c) and from historic 
preservation reporting requirements 
under 49 CFR 1105.8(b).

from the public on the exemption 
request. DOT posts these comments, 
including any personal information the 
commenter provides, to 
www.regulations.gov, as described in the system of records notice DOT/ALL– 
14 FDMS (Federal Docket Management 
System), which can be reviewed under 
the ‘‘Department Wide System of 
Records Notices’’ link at https://
www.transportation.gov/individuals/
privacy/privacy-act-system-records- 
notices. The comments are posted without edit and are searchable by the 
name of the submitter. 
II. Legal Basis 
FMCSA has authority under 49 U.S.C. 
31136(e) and 31315(b) to grant 
exemptions from the Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). 
FMCSA must publish a notice of each 
exemption request in the Federal 
Register (49 CFR 381.315(a)). The Agency must provide the public an 
opportunity to inspect the information 
relevant to the application, including 
the applicant’s safety analysis. The 
Agency must provide an opportunity for 
public comment on the request. 
The Agency reviews the application, 
safety analyses, and public comments 
submitted and determines whether 
granting the exemption would likely 
achieve a level of safety equivalent to, 
or greater than, the level that would be 
achieved absent such exemption, 
pursuant to the standard set forth 49 
U.S.C. 31315(b)(1). The Agency must 
publish its decision in the Federal 
Register (49 CFR 381.315(b)). If granted, the notice will identify the regulatory 
provision from which the applicant will 
be exempt, the effective period, and all 
terms and conditions of the exemption 
(49 CFR 381.315(c)(1)). If the exemption 
is denied, the notice will explain the 
reason for the denial (49 CFR 
381.315(c)(2)). The exemption may be 
renewed (49 CFR 381.300(b)). FMCSA 
grants medical exemptions from the 
FMCSRs for a 2-year period to align 
with the maximum duration of a 
driver’s medical certification. 
III. Background 
The physical qualification standard 
for drivers regarding seizures and loss of 
consciousness provides that a person is 
physically qualified to drive a CMV if 
that person has ‘‘no established medical 
history or clinical diagnosis of epilepsy 
or any other condition which is likely 
to cause the loss of consciousness or any 
loss of ability to control’’ a CMV (49 
CFR 391.41(b)(8)). To assist in applying 
this standard, FMCSA publishes 
guidance for medical examiners (ME) in 
the form of medical advisory criteria in 
Appendix A to 49 CFR part 391.
1
In 
2007, FMCSA published 
recommendations from a Medical 
Expert Panel (MEP) that FMCSA tasked 
to review the existing seizure disorder 
guidelines for MEs.
2
The MEP 
performed a comprehensive, systematic 
literature review, including evidence 
available at the time. The MEP issued 
recommended criteria to evaluate 
whether an individual with a history of 
epilepsy, a single unprovoked seizure, 
or a provoked seizure should be allowed 
to drive a CMV. 
On January 15, 2013, FMCSA began 
granting exemptions, on a case-by-case 
basis, to individual drivers from the 
physical qualification standard 
regarding seizures and loss of 
consciousness in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(8) 
(78 FR 3069). The Agency considers the 
medical advisory criteria, the 2007 MEP 
recommendations, any public comments 
received, and each individual’s medical 
information and driving record in 
deciding whether to grant the 
exemption. 
The 52 individuals listed in this 
notice have requested an exemption 
from the epilepsy and seizure disorders 
prohibition in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(8). 
Accordingly, the Agency will evaluate 
the qualifications of each applicant to 
determine whether granting the 
exemption will achieve the required 
level of safety mandated by statute.

Background 
An LCV is any combination of a truck- 
tractor and two or more semi-trailers or 
trailers that operates on the National 
System of Interstate and Defense 
Highways (according to 23 CFR part 
470.107) and has a gross vehicle weight 
greater than 80,000 pounds. To enhance 
the safety of LCV operations on our 
Nation’s highways, section 4007(b) of 
the Motor Carrier Act of 1991 directed 
the Secretary of Transportation to 
establish Federal minimum training 
requirements for drivers of LCVs 
(Intermodal Surface Transportation 
Efficiency Act of 1991, Public Law 102– 
240, 105 Stat. 1914, 2152). The 
Secretary of Transportation delegated 
responsibility for establishing these 
requirements to FMCSA (49 CFR part 
1.87), and on March 30, 2004, after 
appropriate notice and solicitation of 
public comment, FMCSA established 
the current training requirements for 
operators of LCVs (69 FR 16722). The 
regulations bar motor carriers from 
permitting their drivers to operate an 
LCV if they have not been properly 
trained in accordance with the 
requirements of § 380.113. Drivers 
receive an LCV Driver-Training 
Certificate upon successful completion 
of these training requirements. Motor 
carriers employing an LCV driver must 
verify the driver’s qualifications to 
operate an LCV and must maintain a 
copy of the LCV Driver-Training 
Certificate and present it to authorized 
Federal, State, or local officials upon 
request. 
Renewal of This Information Collection 
(IC) 
The current burden estimate 
associated with this IC, approved by 
OMB on July 3, 2023, is 4,360 hours. 
The expiration date of the current ICR 
is July 31, 2026. Through this ICR 
renewal, the Agency requests an 
increase in the burden hours from 4,360 
hours to 4,959 hours. The increase is the 
result of the increase in estimated driver 
population as well as the increase in 
expected industry growth rate for 
drivers from 2024 to 2034. 
Title: Training Certification for Drivers of LCVs. 
OMB Control Number: 2126–0026. 
Type of Request: Renewal of an 
information collection. 
Respondents: LCV training providers, drivers, and motor carriers employing 
LCV drivers. 
Estimated Number of Respondents: 
59,333, consisting of 178 LCV training 
providers, 178 newly certified LCV 
drivers seeking employment, 29,400 
currently certified LCV drivers seeking 
employment, and 29,577 motor carriers 
employing LCV drivers. 
Estimated Time per Response: 10 
minutes for preparation of LCV Driver- 
Training Certificates for drivers who 
successfully complete the LCV training, 
and 10 minutes for activities associated 
with the LCV Driver-Training Certificate 
during the hiring process. 
Expiration Date: July 31, 2026.

Dockets Operations. 
D. Privacy Act 
In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 
31315(b)(6), DOT solicits comments 
from the public on the exemption 
requests. DOT posts these comments, 
including any personal information the 
commenter provides, to 
www.regulations.gov, as described in the system of records notice DOT/ALL– 
14 FDMS (Federal Docket Management 
System), which can be reviewed under 
the ‘‘Department Wide System of 
Records Notices’’ link at https://
www.transportation.gov/individuals/ 
privacy/privacy-act-system-records- 
notices. The comments are posted without edit and are searchable by the 
name of the submitter. 
II. Legal Basis 
FMCSA has authority under 49 U.S.C. 
31136(e) and 31315(b) to grant 
exemptions from the FMCSRs. FMCSA 
must publish a notice of each exemption 
request in the Federal Register (49 CFR 
381.315(a)). The Agency must provide 
the public an opportunity to inspect the 
information relevant to the application, 
including the applicant’s safety 
analysis. The Agency must provide an 
opportunity for public comment on the 
request. 
The Agency reviews the application, 
safety analyses, and public comments 
submitted and determines whether 
granting the exemption would likely 
achieve a level of safety equivalent to, 
or greater than, the level that would be 
achieved absent such exemption, 
pursuant to the standard set forth in 49 
U.S.C. 31315(b)(1). The Agency must 
publish its decision in the Federal 
Register (49 CFR 381.315(b)). If granted, the notice will identify the regulatory 
provision from which the applicant will 
be exempt, the effective period, and all 
terms and conditions of the exemption 
(49 CFR 381.315(c)(1)). If the exemption 
is denied, the notice will explain the 
reason for the denial (49 CFR 
381.315(c)(2)). The exemption may be 
renewed (49 CFR 381.300(b)). FMCSA 
grants medical exemptions from the 
FMCSRs for a 2-year period to align 
with the maximum duration of a 
driver’s medical certification. 
III. Background 
The physical qualification standard 
for drivers regarding hearing, found in 
49 CFR 391.41(b)(11), states that a 
person is physically qualified to drive a 
CMV if that person first perceives a 
forced whispered voice in the better ear 
at not less than 5 feet with or without 
the use of a hearing aid or, if tested by 
use of an audiometric device, does not 
have an average hearing loss in the 
better ear greater than 40 decibels at 500 
Hz, 1,000 Hz, and 2,000 Hz with or 
without a hearing aid when the 
audiometric device is calibrated to 
American National Standard (formerly 
ASA Standard) Z24.5—1951. 
This standard was adopted in 1970 
and was revised in 1971 to allow drivers 
to be qualified under this standard 
while wearing a hearing aid (35 FR 
6458, 6463 (Apr. 22, 1970) and 36 FR 
12857 (July 8, 1971)). 
The 21 individuals listed in this 
notice have requested renewal of their 
exemptions from the hearing standard 
in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(11), in accordance 
with FMCSA procedures. Accordingly, 
FMCSA has evaluated these 
applications for renewal on their merits 
and decided to extend each exemption 
for a renewable 2-year period. 
IV. Request for Comments 
Interested parties or organizations 
possessing information that would 
otherwise show that any, or all, of these 
drivers are not currently achieving the 
statutory level of safety should 
immediately notify FMCSA. The 
Agency will evaluate any adverse 
evidence submitted and, if safety is 
being compromised or if continuation of 
the exemption would not be consistent 
with the goals and objectives of 49 
U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b), FMCSA 
will take immediate steps to revoke the 
exemption of a driver. 
V. Basis for Renewing Exemptions 
In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) 
and 31315(b), each of the 21 applicants 
has satisfied the renewal conditions for 
obtaining an exemption from the 
hearing requirement. The 21 drivers in 
this notice remain in good standing with 
the Agency. In addition, the Agency has 
reviewed each applicant’s certified 
driving record from their State Driver’s 
Licensing Agency (SDLA). The 
information obtained from each 
applicant’s driving record provides the 
Agency with details regarding any 
moving violations or reported crash 
data, which demonstrates whether the 
driver has a safe driving history and is 
an indicator of future driving 
performance. If the driving record 
revealed a crash, FMCSA requested and 
reviewed the related police reports and 
other relevant documents, such as the 
citation and conviction information. 
These factors provide an adequate basis 
for predicting each driver’s ability to 
continue to safely operate a CMV in 
interstate commerce. Accordingly, 
FMCSA concludes that extending the 
exemption for each of these drivers for 
a period of 2 years is likely to achieve 
a level of safety equivalent to that 
existing without the exemption. 
In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) 
and 31315(b), the following groups of 
drivers received renewed exemptions in 
the month of December and are 
discussed below. 
As of December 11, 2025, and in 
accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 
31315(b), the following 11 individuals 
have satisfied the renewal conditions for 
obtaining an exemption from the 
hearing requirement in the FMCSRs for 
interstate CMV drivers: 
Jeromy Brand (AL) 
Shaun Cannady (CA) 
Mathias Conway (MI) 
Wayne Crowl (IN)

2023–0024. Their exemptions were 
applicable as of December 11, 2025, and 
will expire on December 11, 2027. 
In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) 
and 31315(b), the following 10

numbers FMCSA–2017–0058, FMCSA– 
2018–0136, FMCSA–2018–0138, 
FMCSA–2019–0109, or FMCSA–2019– 
0110. Their exemptions are applicable 
as of December 26, 2025, and will expire 
on December 26, 2027. 
VI. Terms and Conditions 
The exemptions are extended subject 
to the following conditions: each driver 
(1) must report to FMCSA any crashes, 
as defined in 49 CFR 390.5T, within 7 
days of the crash; (2) must report to 
FMCSA any citations and convictions 
for disqualifying offenses under 49 CFR 
parts 383 and 391, within 7 days of the 
citation and conviction; (3) must submit 
to FMCSA annual certified driving 
records from their SDLA; and (4) is 
prohibited from operating a motorcoach 
or bus with passengers in interstate 
commerce. The driver must also have a 
copy of the exemption when driving, for 
presentation to a duly authorized 
Federal, State, or local law enforcement 
official. In addition, the driver must 
meet all the applicable commercial 
driver’s license testing requirements. 
Each exemption will be valid for 2 years 
unless rescinded earlier by FMCSA. The 
exemption will be rescinded if: (1) the 
person fails to comply with the terms 
and conditions of the exemption; (2) the 
exemption has resulted in a lower level 
of safety than was maintained before it 
was granted; or (3) continuation of the 
exemption would not be consistent with 
the goals and objectives of 49 U.S.C. 
31136(e) and 31315(b). 
VII. Preemption 
During the period the exemption is in 
effect, no State shall enforce any law or 
regulation that conflicts with this 
exemption with respect to a person 
operating under the exemption. 
VIII. Conclusion 
Based upon its evaluation of the 21 
exemption renewal applications, 
FMCSA renews the exemptions of the 
above-named drivers from the hearing 
requirement in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(11). In 
accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 
31315(b), and FMCSA’s policy of 
issuing medical exemptions for a 2-year 
period to correspond with the medical 
certificate, each exemption will be valid 
for 2 years unless revoked earlier by 
FMCSA.

notices. The comments are posted without edit and are searchable by the 
name of the submitter. 
II. Legal Basis 
FMCSA has authority under 49 U.S.C. 
31136(e) and 31315(b) to grant 
exemptions from the Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). 
FMCSA must publish a notice of each 
exemption request in the Federal 
Register (49 CFR 381.315(a)). The Agency must provide the public an 
opportunity to inspect the information 
relevant to the application, including 
the applicant’s safety analysis. The 
Agency must provide an opportunity for 
public comment on the request. 
The Agency reviews the application, 
safety analyses, and public comments 
submitted and determines whether 
granting the exemption would likely 
achieve a level of safety equivalent to, 
or greater than, the level that would be 
achieved absent such exemption, 
pursuant to the standard set forth in 49 
U.S.C. 31315(b)(1). The Agency must 
publish its decision in the Federal 
Register (49 CFR 381.315(b)). If granted, the notice will identify the regulatory 
provision from which the applicant will 
be exempt, the effective period, and all 
terms and conditions of the exemption 
(49 CFR 381.315(c)(1)). If the exemption 
is denied, the notice will explain the 
reason for the denial (49 CFR 
381.315(c)(2)). The exemption may be 
renewed (49 CFR 381.300(b)). FMCSA 
grants medical exemptions from the 
FMCSRs for a 2-year period to align 
with the maximum duration of a 
driver’s medical certification. 
III. Background 
The physical qualification standard 
for drivers regarding hearing, found in 
§ 391.41(b)(11), states that a person is 
physically qualified to drive a CMV if 
that person first perceives a forced 
whispered voice in the better ear at not 
less than 5 feet with or without the use 
of a hearing aid or, if tested by use of 
an audiometric device, does not have an 
average hearing loss in the better ear 
greater than 40 decibels at 500 Hz, 1,000 
Hz, and 2,000 Hz with or without a 
hearing aid when the audiometric 
device is calibrated to American 
National Standard (formerly ASA 
Standard) Z24.5—1951. 
This standard was adopted in 1970 
and was revised in 1971 to allow drivers 
to be qualified under this standard 
while wearing a hearing aid (35 FR 
6458, 6463 (Apr. 22, 1970) and 36 FR 
12857 (July 8, 1971)). In 2008, FMCSA 
published Evidence Report, ‘‘Executive 
Summary on Hearing, Vestibular 
Function and Commercial Motor 
Driving Safety.’’
1
The evidence report 
reached two conclusions regarding the 
matter of hearing loss and CMV driver 
safety: (1) no studies that examined the 
relationship between hearing loss and 
crash risk exclusively among CMV 
drivers were identified; and (2) evidence 
from studies of the private driver’s 
license holder population does not 
support the contention that individuals 
with hearing impairment are at an 
increased risk for a crash. 
On February 1, 2013, FMCSA began 
granting exemptions, on a case-by-case 
basis, to individual drivers from the 
physical qualification standard 
regarding hearing in 49 CFR 
391.41(b)(11) (78 FR 3069). The Agency 
considers relevant scientific information 
and literature, the 2008 Evidence 
Report, ‘‘Executive Summary on 
Hearing, Vestibular Function and 
Commercial Motor Driving Safety,’’ any 
public comments received, and each 
individual’s driving record in deciding 
whether to grant the exemption. 
The 12 individuals listed in this 
notice have requested an exemption 
from the hearing standard in 49 CFR 
391.41(b)(11). Accordingly, the Agency 
will evaluate the qualifications of each 
applicant to determine whether granting 
the exemption will achieve the required 
level of safety mandated by statute.

exemptions from the Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). 
FMCSA must publish a notice of each 
exemption request in the Federal 
Register (49 CFR 381.315(a)). The Agency must provide the public an 
opportunity to inspect the information 
relevant to the application, including 
the applicant’s safety analysis. The 
Agency must provide an opportunity for 
public comment on the request. 
The Agency reviews the application, 
safety analyses, and public comments 
submitted and determines whether 
granting the exemption would likely 
achieve a level of safety equivalent to, 
or greater than, the level that would be 
achieved absent such exemption, 
pursuant to the standard set forth 49 
U.S.C. 31315(b)(1). The Agency must 
publish its decision in the Federal 
Register (49 CFR 381.315(b)). If granted, the notice will identify the regulatory 
provision from which the applicant will 
be exempt, the effective period, and all 
terms and conditions of the exemption 
(49 CFR 381.315(c)(1)). If the exemption 
is denied, the notice will explain the 
reason for the denial (49 CFR 
381.315(c)(2)). The exemption may be 
renewed (49 CFR 381.300(b)). FMCSA 
grants medical exemptions from the 
FMCSRs for a 2-year period to align 
with the maximum duration of a 
driver’s medical certification. 
III. Background 
The physical qualification standard 
for drivers regarding seizures and loss of 
consciousness provides that a person is 
physically qualified to drive a CMV if 
that person has ‘‘no established medical 
history or clinical diagnosis of epilepsy 
or any other condition which is likely 
to cause the loss of consciousness or any 
loss of ability to control’’ a CMV (49 
CFR 391.41(b)(8)). To assist in applying 
this standard, FMCSA publishes 
guidance for medical examiners (ME) in 
the form of medical advisory criteria in 
Appendix A to 49 CFR part 391.
1
In 
2007, FMCSA published 
recommendations from a Medical 
Expert Panel (MEP) that FMCSA tasked 
to review the existing seizure disorder 
guidelines for MEs.
2
The MEP 
performed a comprehensive, systematic 
literature review, including evidence 
available at the time. The MEP issued 
recommended criteria to evaluate 
whether an individual with a history of 
epilepsy, a single unprovoked seizure, 
or a provoked seizure should be allowed 
to drive a CMV. 
On January 15, 2013, FMCSA began 
granting exemptions, on a case-by-case 
basis, to individual drivers from the 
physical qualification standard 
regarding seizures and loss of 
consciousness in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(8) 
(78 FR 3069). The Agency considers the 
medical advisory criteria, the 2007 MEP 
recommendations, any public comments 
received, and each individual’s medical 
information and driving record in 
deciding whether to grant the 
exemption. 
The 12 individuals listed in this 
notice have requested an exemption 
from the epilepsy and seizure disorders 
prohibition in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(8). 
Accordingly, the Agency will evaluate 
the qualifications of each applicant to 
determine whether granting the 
exemption will achieve the required 
level of safety mandated by statute.

Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration 
[Docket No. FMCSA–2020–0171] 
Hours of Service of Drivers: 
Association of American Railroads and 
American Short Line and Regional 
Railroad Association; Application for 
Exemption Renewal 
AGENCY: Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), Department 
of Transportation (DOT). 
ACTION: Notice of provisional renewal of exemption; request for comments. 
SUMMARY: FMCSA announces its decision to renew provisionally for six 
months the exemption requested by the 
Association of American Railroads and 
the American Short Line and Regional 
Railroad Association and member 
railroads (collectively ‘‘the 
Associations’’) from the prohibitions 
against driving after the 14th hour from 
the beginning of the work shift (the 14- 
hour rule) and against driving after 
accumulating 60 hours of on duty time 
within 7 consecutive days, or 70 hours 
of on duty time within 8 consecutive 
days (the 60-hour/70-hour rule). The 
exemption will enable the employees of 
the Associations’ member railroads, 
subject to the hours-of-service (HOS) 
rules, to respond to unplanned events 
that occur outside of, or extend beyond, 
an employee’s normal work hours. The 
Associations are seeking a five-year 
renewal of this exemption. FMCSA 
requests public comment on the 
application for exemption renewal. 
DATES: The provisional renewal of the exemption is effective from December 
18, 2025, and expires on June 18, 2026.

II. Legal Basis 
FMCSA has authority under 49 U.S.C. 
31136(e) and 31315(b) to grant 
exemptions from the Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Regulations. FMCSA must 
publish a notice of each exemption 
request in the Federal Register (49 CFR 
381.315(a)). The Agency must provide 
the public an opportunity to inspect the 
information relevant to the application, 
including the applicant’s safety 
analysis. The Agency must provide an 
opportunity for public comment on the 
request. 
The Agency reviews the application, 
safety analyses, and public comments 
submitted and determines whether 
granting the exemption would likely 
achieve a level of safety equivalent to, 
or greater than, the level that would be 
achieved absent such exemption, 
pursuant to the standard set forth in 49 
U.S.C. 31315(b)(1). The Agency must 
publish notice of its decision in the 
Federal Register (49 CFR 381.315(b)). If 
granted, the notice will identify the 
regulatory provision(s) from which the 
applicant will be exempt, the effective 
period, and all terms and conditions of 
the exemption (49 CFR 381.315(c)(1)). If 
the exemption is denied, the notice will 
explain the reason for the denial (49 
CFR 381.315(c)(2)). The exemption may 
be renewed (49 CFR 381.300(b)). 
III. Background 
Current Regulatory Requirements 
Under 49 CFR 395.3(a)(2), a driver 
may not drive after a period of 14 
consecutive hours after coming on-duty 
following 10 consecutive hours off-duty. 
Under 49 CFR 395.3(b), no motor 
carrier shall permit or require a driver 
of a property-carrying commercial motor 
vehicle (CMV) to drive, nor shall any 
driver drive a property-carrying CMV, 
regardless of the number of motor 
carriers using the driver’s services, for 
any period after having been on duty 60 
hours in any period of 7 consecutive 
days or 70 hours in any period of 8 
consecutive days. 
Application for Renewal of Exemption 
The Associations seek a renewal of 
the exemption from 49 CFR 395.3(a)(2) 
and (b). The Associations believe the 
HOS prohibitions in the 14-hour rule 
and the 60-hour/70-hour rule inhibit a 
railroad’s ability to respond 
expeditiously to certain types of 
emergency situations. The Associations 
request that a railroad employee 
responding to an unplanned event that 
affects railroad operations (including 
passenger rail operations) and that 
occurs outside of, or extends beyond, 
the employee’s normal shift, be exempt 
from these requirements. Unplanned 
events include: a derailment; a rail 
failure or other report of dangerous track 
condition; a disruption to the electric 
propulsion system; a bridge strike; a 
disabled vehicle on the track; a train 
collision; weather- and storm-related 
events; a matter of national security; a 
matter concerning public safety; and a 
blocked grade crossing. 
The exemption renewal request 
mirrors the request submitted by R.J. 
Corman Railroad Services, 
Cranemasters, Inc., and the National 
Railroad Construction and Maintenance 
Association, Inc., which FMCSA 
granted on March 4, 2020 (85 FR 12818) 
and renewed effective March 4, 2025, 
for five years (90 FR 34956). The 
exemption renewal request provides 
that, while operating under this 
exemption, drivers and carriers would 
be allowed to extend the 14-hour rule in 
§ 395.3(a)(2) to no more than 17 hours; 
would not be allowed to exceed 11 
hours of driving time following 10 
consecutive hours off-duty; would be 
allowed to extend the 60-hour/70-hour 
rule in § 395.3(b) by no more than 6 
hours; and, drivers would not be 
allowed to travel more than 300 air 
miles from their normal work-reporting 
location or terminal. 
In addition, drivers covered by the 
exemption renewal would comply with 
the applicable HOS limits after arriving 
at the site and would record all time 
working to restore rail service as on- 
duty, not driving time. Drivers would 
also have the benefit of FMCSA’s 
personal conveyance guidance when 
travelling between the unplanned event 
work site and nearby lodging or dining 
facilities. To the extent that guidance is 
not applicable, CMV drivers who have 
reached the HOS limits would be 
transported from the work site after 
onsite duties are completed by an 
individual who is not subject to HOS 
restrictions, or would use a vehicle that 
does not meet FMCSA’s definition of a 
CMV in 49 CFR 390.5T. 
Applicant’s Equivalent Level of Safety 
The Associations state that drivers 
operating under the exemption would 
receive resources on fatigue 
management appropriate to the rail 
working environment and emergency 
response to unplanned events. 
Specifically, drivers would complete the 
Driver Education Module 3 and Driver 
Sleep Disorders and Management 
Module 7 of the North American Fatigue 
Management Program (NAFMP) or 
would refer to the 
Federal Railroad Administration’s 
(FRA) website, the ‘‘Railroaders’ Guide 
to Healthy Sleep’’ (https://
railroadersleep.fra.dot.gov/), as an alternative resource on strategies and 
resources to help railroad employees 
manage fatigue. The Associations 
request that the exemption be renewed 
for five years. The exemption would 
cover approximately 20,000 drivers and 
11,000 CMVs. 
A copy of the exemption application 
is available for review in the docket for 
this notice. 
IV. Grant of Provisional Renewal of 
Exemption 
FMCSA determined in 2020 that the 
exemption, subject to the terms and 
conditions imposed, would likely

December 18, 2025 through June 18, 
2026, 11:59 p.m. local time, unless 
revoked. 
A. Applicability of Exemption 
This exemption is restricted to 
individuals employed by the member 
railroads of the Associations while 
driving CMVs to the site of an 
‘‘unplanned event’’ which includes the 
following: 
€A derailment; €A rail failure or other report of a dangerous track condition; 
€A track occupancy light; €A disruption to the electric propulsion system; 
€A bridge strike; €A disabled vehicle on the train tracks; 
€A train collision; €Weather- and storm-related events including fallen trees and other debris 
on the tracks, snow, extreme cold or 
heat, rock and mudslides, track 
washouts, and earthquakes; and 
€A matter concerning national security or public safety, including a 
blocked grade crossing. 
B. Terms and Conditions 
1. When operating under this 
exemption, drivers and carriers: 
€May extend the 14-hour rule in § 395.3(a)(2) to no more than 17 hours; 
€May not exceed 11 hours of driving time, following 10 consecutive hours 
off-duty; 
€May extend the 60-hour/70-hour rule in § 395.3(b) by no more than 6 
hours; and 
€May not travel more than 300 air miles from the normal work-reporting 
location or terminal; 
2. Drivers must comply with the 
applicable HOS limits after arriving at 
the site, including that drivers must 
record all time working to restore rail 
service as on-duty, not driving time; 
3. Drivers may take advantage of the 
Agency’s personal conveyance 
regulatory guidance when traveling 
between the unplanned event work site 
and nearby lodging or dining facilities 
(83 FR 26377 (June 7, 2018)). If that 
guidance is not applicable to the trip, 
CMV drivers who have reached the HOS 
limits must be transported from the 
work site by an individual who is not 
subject to HOS restrictions or use a 
vehicle that does not meet FMCSA’s 
definition of a CMV (49 CFR 390.5T) 
when they leave the site; 
4. Drivers must complete the Driver 
Education Module 3 and the Driver 
Sleep Disorders and Management 
Module 7 of the NAFMP 
(www.nafmp.org) prior to operating 
under the exemption; railroads subject 
to the exemption could direct CMV 
drivers to the DOT’s FRA’s website, the 
‘‘Railroaders’ Guide to Healthy Sleep 
(https://railroadersleep.fra.dot.gov/) as an alternative resource if NAFMP’s 
website is unavailable; 
5. Motor carriers and drivers must 
comply with all other provisions of the 
Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Regulations; 
6. Upon request, the Associations 
must provide to FMCSA a list of the 
U.S. Department of Transportation 
(USDOT) numbers of motor carriers 
operating under this exemption; and 
7. Notification to FMCSA. The 
Associations must notify FMCSA within 
five business days of any accident, as 
defined in 49 CFR 390.5T, involving any 
of the motor carrier’s CMVs operating 
under the terms of this exemption. 
Reports filed under this provision shall 
be emailed to MCPSD@DOT.GOV. The notification must include the following 
information: 
a. Identifier of the Exemption: ‘‘The 
Associations;’’ 
b. Name of operating carrier and 
USDOT number; 
c. Date of the crash; 
d. City or town, and State, in which 
the accident occurred, or closest to the 
crash scene; 
e. Driver’s name and license number; 
f. Co-driver’s name (if any) and 
license number; 
g. Vehicle number and State license 
number; 
h. Number of individuals suffering 
physical injury; 
i. Number of fatalities; 
j. The police-reported cause of the 
crash, if provided by the enforcement 
agency; 
k. Whether the driver was cited for 
violation of any traffic laws or motor 
carrier safety regulations; and 
l. The total on-duty time accumulated 
during the seven consecutive days prior 
to the date of the crash, and the total on- 
duty time and driving time in the work 
shift prior to the crash. 
C. Preemption 
In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 
31315(d), as implemented by 49 CFR 
381.600, during the period this 
exemption is in effect, no State shall 
enforce any law or regulation that 
conflicts with or is inconsistent with 
this exemption with respect to a firm or 
person operating under the exemption. 
States may, but are not required to, 
adopt the same exemption with respect 
to operations in intrastate commerce. 
D. Termination 
FMCSA does not believe the drivers 
covered by this exemption will 
experience any deterioration in their 
safety performance. However, the 
exemption will be revoked if: (1) the 
Associations or the drivers operating 
under the exemption fail to comply with 
the terms and conditions of the 
exemption; (2) the exemption has 
resulted in a lower level of safety than 
was maintained before it was granted; or 
(3) continuation of the exemption would 
not be consistent with the goals and 
objectives of 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 
31315(b). 
V. Request for Comments 
In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 
31315(b), FMCSA requests public 
comment from all interested persons on 
the application for an exemption 
renewal. All comments received before 
the close of business on the comment 
closing date will be considered and will 
be available for examination in the 
docket at the location listed under the 
Addresses section of this notice. 
Comments received after the comment 
closing date will be filed in the public 
docket and will be considered to the 
extent practicable. In addition to late 
comments, FMCSA will also continue to 
file in the public docket relevant 
information that becomes available after 
the comment closing date. Interested 
persons should continue to examine the 
public docket for new material.

www.regulations.gov, as described in the system of records notice DOT/ALL– 
14 FDMS (Federal Docket Management 
System), which can be reviewed under 
the ‘‘Department Wide System of 
Records Notices’’ link at https://
www.transportation.gov/individuals/ 
privacy/privacy-act-system-records- 
notices. The comments are posted without edit and are searchable by the 
name of the submitter. 
II. Legal Basis 
FMCSA has authority under 49 U.S.C. 
31136(e) and 31315(b) to grant 
exemptions from the Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). 
FMCSA must publish a notice of each 
exemption request in the Federal 
Register (49 CFR 381.315(a)). The Agency must provide the public an 
opportunity to inspect the information 
relevant to the application, including 
the applicant’s safety analysis. The 
Agency must provide an opportunity for 
public comment on the request. 
The Agency reviews the application, 
safety analyses, and public comments 
submitted and determines whether 
granting the exemption would likely 
achieve a level of safety equivalent to, 
or greater than, the level that would be 
achieved absent such exemption, 
pursuant to the standard set forth in 49 
U.S.C. 31315(b)(1). The Agency must 
publish its decision in the Federal 
Register (49 CFR 381.315(b)). If granted, the notice will identify the regulatory 
provision from which the applicant will 
be exempt, the effective period, and all 
terms and conditions of the exemption 
(49 CFR 381.315(c)(1)). If the exemption 
is denied, the notice will explain the 
reason for the denial (49 CFR 
381.315(c)(2)). The exemption may be 
renewed (49 CFR 381.300(b)). FMCSA 
grants medical exemptions from the 
FMCSRs for a 2-year period to align 
with the maximum duration of a 
driver’s medical certification. 
III. Background 
The physical qualification standard 
for drivers regarding hearing, found in 
§ 391.41(b)(11), states that a person is 
physically qualified to drive a CMV if 
that person first perceives a forced 
whispered voice in the better ear at not 
less than 5 feet with or without the use 
of a hearing aid or, if tested by use of 
an audiometric device, does not have an

average hearing loss in the better ear 
greater than 40 decibels at 500 Hz, 1,000 
Hz, and 2,000 Hz with or without a 
hearing aid when the audiometric 
device is calibrated to American 
National Standard (formerly ASA 
Standard) Z24.5—1951. 
This standard was adopted in 1970 
and was revised in 1971 to allow drivers 
to be qualified under this standard 
while wearing a hearing aid (35 FR 
6458, 6463 (Apr. 22, 1970) and 36 FR 
12857 (July 8, 1971)). In 2008, FMCSA 
published Evidence Report, ‘‘Executive 
Summary on Hearing, Vestibular 
Function and Commercial Motor 
Driving Safety.’’
1
The evidence report 
reached two conclusions regarding the 
matter of hearing loss and CMV driver 
safety: (1) no studies that examined the 
relationship between hearing loss and 
crash risk exclusively among CMV 
drivers were identified; and (2) evidence 
from studies of the private driver’s 
license holder population does not 
support the contention that individuals 
with hearing impairment are at an 
increased risk for a crash. 
On February 1, 2013, FMCSA began 
granting exemptions, on a case-by-case 
basis, to individual drivers from the 
physical qualification standard 
regarding hearing in 49 CFR 
391.41(b)(11) (78 FR 3069). The Agency 
considers relevant scientific information 
and literature, the 2008 Evidence 
Report, ‘‘Executive Summary on 
Hearing, Vestibular Function and 
Commercial Motor Driving Safety,’’ any 
public comments received, and each 
individual’s driving record in deciding 
whether to grant the exemption. 
The 18 individuals listed in this 
notice have requested an exemption 
from the hearing standard in 49 CFR 
391.41(b)(11). Accordingly, the Agency 
will evaluate the qualifications of each 
applicant to determine whether granting 
the exemption will achieve the required 
level of safety mandated by statute.

D. Privacy Act 
In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 
31315(b)(6), DOT solicits comments 
from the public on the exemption 
requests. DOT posts these comments, 
including any personal information the 
commenter provides, to 
www.regulations.gov, as described in the system of records notice DOT/ALL– 
14 FDMS (Federal Docket Management 
System), which can be reviewed under 
the ‘‘Department Wide System of 
Records Notices’’ link at https://
www.transportation.gov/individuals/ 
privacy/privacy-act-system-records- 
notices. The comments are posted without edit and are searchable by the 
name of the submitter. 
II. Legal Basis 
FMCSA has authority under 49 U.S.C. 
31136(e) and 31315(b) to grant 
exemptions from the FMCSRs. FMCSA 
must publish a notice of each exemption 
request in the Federal Register (49 CFR 
381.315(a)). The Agency must provide 
the public an opportunity to inspect the 
information relevant to the application, 
including the applicant’s safety 
analysis. The Agency must provide an 
opportunity for public comment on the 
request. 
The Agency reviews the application, 
safety analyses, and public comments 
submitted and determines whether 
granting the exemption would likely 
achieve a level of safety equivalent to, 
or greater than, the level that would be 
achieved absent such exemption, 
pursuant to the standard set forth in 49 
U.S.C. 31315(b)(1). The Agency must 
publish its decision in the Federal 
Register (49 CFR 381.315(b)). If granted, the notice will identify the regulatory 
provision from which the applicant will 
be exempt, the effective period, and all 
terms and conditions of the exemption 
(49 CFR 381.315(c)(1)). If the exemption 
is denied, the notice will explain the 
reason for the denial (49 CFR 
381.315(c)(2)). The exemption may be 
renewed (49 CFR 381.300(b)). FMCSA 
grants medical exemptions from the 
FMCSRs for a 2-year period to align 
with the maximum duration of a 
driver’s medical certification. 
III. Background 
The physical qualification standard 
for drivers regarding hearing, found in 
49 CFR 391.41(b)(11), states that a 
person is physically qualified to drive a 
CMV if that person first perceives a 
forced whispered voice in the better ear

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES159654 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Notices at not less than 5 feet with or without 
the use of a hearing aid or, if tested by 
use of an audiometric device, does not 
have an average hearing loss in the 
better ear greater than 40 decibels at 500 
Hz, 1,000 Hz, and 2,000 Hz with or 
without a hearing aid when the 
audiometric device is calibrated to 
American National Standard (formerly 
ASA Standard) Z24.5—1951. 
This standard was adopted in 1970 
and was revised in 1971 to allow drivers 
to be qualified under this standard 
while wearing a hearing aid (35 FR 
6458, 6463 (Apr. 22, 1970) and 36 FR 
12857 (July 8, 1971)). 
The 13 individuals listed in this 
notice have requested renewal of their 
exemptions from the hearing standard 
in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(11), in accordance 
with FMCSA procedures. Accordingly, 
FMCSA has evaluated these 
applications for renewal on their merits 
and decided to extend each exemption 
for a renewable 2-year period. 
IV. Request for Comments 
Interested parties or organizations 
possessing information that would 
otherwise show that any, or all, of these 
drivers are not currently achieving the 
statutory level of safety should 
immediately notify FMCSA. The 
Agency will evaluate any adverse 
evidence submitted and, if safety is 
being compromised or if continuation of 
the exemption would not be consistent 
with the goals and objectives of 49 
U.S.C. 31136(e) and 31315(b), FMCSA 
will take immediate steps to revoke the 
exemption of a driver. 
V. Basis for Renewing Exemptions 
In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) 
and 31315(b), each of the 13 applicants 
have satisfied the renewal conditions for 
obtaining an exemption from the 
hearing requirement. The 13 drivers in 
this notice remain in good standing with 
the Agency. In addition, the Agency has 
reviewed each applicant’s certified 
driving record from their State Driver’s 
Licensing Agency (SDLA). The 
information obtained from each 
applicant’s driving record provides the 
Agency with details regarding any 
moving violations or reported crash 
data, which demonstrates whether the 
driver has a safe driving history and is 
an indicator of future driving 
performance. If the driving record 
revealed a crash, FMCSA requested and 
reviewed the related police reports and 
other relevant documents, such as the 
citation and conviction information. 
These factors provide an adequate basis 
for predicting each driver’s ability to 
continue to safely operate a CMV in 
interstate commerce. Accordingly, 
FMCSA concludes that extending the 
exemption for each of these drivers for 
a period of 2 years is likely to achieve 
a level of safety equivalent to that 
existing without the exemption. 
In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) 
and 31315(b), the following groups of 
drivers received renewed exemptions in 
the month of November and are 
discussed below. 
As of November 3, 2025, and in 
accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 
31315(b), the following six individuals 
have satisfied the renewal conditions for 
obtaining an exemption from the 
hearing requirement in the FMCSRs for 
interstate CMV drivers: 
Richard Carter (MD) 
Robert Cates (NM) 
Rebecca Haynes (TX) 
Mark Howard (NY) 
Jonathan Muhm (KY) 
Joseph Piros (CA) 
The drivers were included in docket 
numbers FMCSA–2014–0387, FMCSA– 
2017–0057, FMCSA–2017–0060, 
FMCSA–2018–0138, FMCSA–2021– 
0014, or FMCSA–2023–0022. Their 
exemptions were applicable as of 
November 3, 2025, and will expire on 
November 3, 2027. 
As of November 19, 2025, and in 
accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 
31315(b), the following seven 
individuals have satisfied the renewal 
conditions for obtaining an exemption 
from the hearing requirement in the 
FMCSRs for interstate CMV drivers: 
Jeffrey Barbuto (NH) 
Jason Gensler (OH) 
Emil Iontchev (IL) 
Jerrell McCrary (NC) 
Danny McGowan (WV) 
Stuart Randles (FL) 
Jennifer Valentine (TX) 
The drivers were included in docket 
numbers FMCSA–2014–0383, FMCSA– 
2014–0385, FMCSA–2014–0387, 
FMCSA–2019–0110, or FMCSA–2021– 
0015. Their exemptions were applicable 
as of November 19, 2025, and will 
expire on November 19, 2027. 
VI. Terms and Conditions 
The exemptions are extended subject 
to the following conditions: each driver 
(1) must report to FMCSA any crashes, 
as defined in 49 CFR 390.5T, within 7 
days of the crash; (2) must report to 
FMCSA any citations and convictions 
for disqualifying offenses under 49 CFR 
parts 383 and 391, within 7 days of the 
citation and conviction; (3) must submit 
to FMCSA annual certified driving 
records from their SDLA; and (4) is 
prohibited from operating a motorcoach 
or bus with passengers in interstate 
commerce. The driver must also have a 
copy of the exemption when driving, for 
presentation to a duly authorized 
Federal, State, or local law enforcement 
official. In addition, the driver must 
meet all the applicable commercial 
driver’s license testing requirements. 
Each exemption will be valid for 2 years 
unless rescinded earlier by FMCSA. The 
exemption will be rescinded if: (1) the 
person fails to comply with the terms 
and conditions of the exemption; (2) the 
exemption has resulted in a lower level 
of safety than was maintained before it 
was granted; or (3) continuation of the 
exemption would not be consistent with 
the goals and objectives of 49 U.S.C. 
31136(e) and 31315(b). 
VII. Preemption 
During the period the exemption is in 
effect, no State shall enforce any law or 
regulation that conflicts with this 
exemption with respect to a person 
operating under the exemption. 
VIII. Conclusion 
Based upon its evaluation of the 13 
exemption renewal applications, 
FMCSA renews the exemptions of the 
above-named drivers from the hearing 
requirement in 49 CFR 391.41(b)(11). In 
accordance with 49 U.S.C. 31136(e) and 
31315(b), and FMCSA’s policy of 
issuing medical exemptions for a 2-year 
period to correspond with the medical 
certificate, each exemption will be valid 
for 2 years unless revoked earlier by 
FMCSA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The United States Sentencing Commission is 
an independent agency in the judicial 
branch of the United States 
Government. The Commission 
promulgates sentencing guidelines and 
policy statements for federal courts 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(a). The 
Commission also periodically reviews 
and revises previously promulgated 
guidelines pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o) 
and submits guideline amendments to 
the Congress not later than the first day 
of May each year pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 
994(p). 
Publication of a proposed amendment 
requires the affirmative vote of at least 
three voting members of the 
Commission and is deemed to be a 
request for public comment on the 
proposed amendment. See USSC Rules of Practice and Procedure 2.2, 4.4. In 
contrast, the affirmative vote of at least 
four voting members is required to 
promulgate an amendment and submit 
it to Congress. See id. 2.2; 28 U.S.C. 
994(p). 
The proposed amendments in this 
notice are presented in one of two 
formats. First, some of the amendments 
are proposed as specific revisions to a 
guideline, policy statement, or 
commentary. Bracketed text within a 
proposed amendment indicates a 
heightened interest on the 
Commission’s part in comment and 
suggestions regarding alternative policy 
choices; for example, a proposed 
enhancement of [2][4][6] levels indicates 
that the Commission is considering, and 
invites comment on, alternative policy 
choices regarding the appropriate level 
of enhancement. Similarly, bracketed 
text within a specific offense 
characteristic or application note means 
that the Commission specifically invites 
comment on whether the proposed 
provision is appropriate. Second, the 
Commission has highlighted certain 
issues for comment and invites 
suggestions on how the Commission 
should respond to those issues. 
In summary, the proposed 
amendments and issues for comment set 
forth in this notice are as follows: 
(1) A multi-part proposed amendment 
relating to drug offenses, including (A) 
(i) two options for amending § 2D1.1 
(Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, 
Exporting, or Trafficking (Including 
Possession with Intent to Commit These 
Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) to 
address the purity distinction between 
methamphetamine in ‘‘actual’’ form and 
methamphetamine as part of a mixture; 
(ii) amendments to § 2D1.1 to address 
offenses involving ‘‘Ice;’’ and (iii) 
related issues for comment; (B) 
amendments to § 2D1.1 to address the 
enactment of the Halt All Lethal 
Trafficking of Fentanyl Act (HALT 
Fentanyl Act), which permanently 
scheduled ‘‘fentanyl-related 
substances,’’ and a related issue for 
comment; and (C) amendments to 
§ 2D1.1 to add new enhancements for 
offenses involving fentanyl and fentanyl 
analogues, and related issues for 
comment. 
(2) A proposed amendment to the 
Guidelines Manual to amend the 
monetary tables and values to adjust for 
inflation, including the monetary values 
in the fine tables for individual 
defendants and for organizational 
defendants, and related issues for 
comment. 
(3) A two-part proposed amendment 
relating to § 2B1.1 (Theft, Property 
Destruction, and Fraud), including (A) a 
proposal to restructure the loss table at 
§ 2B1.1(b)(1) to simplify application of 
the table, and related issues for 
comment; and (B) amendments to 
§ 2B1.1 to revise existing specific 
offense characteristics and add new 
specific offense characteristics to reflect 
the culpability of the individual and 
harm to the victim, and related issues 
for comment. 
(4) A proposed amendment to Chapter 
Three, Part E setting forth two options 
to add a new adjustment at § 3E1.2 
(Post-Offense Rehabilitation) providing 
a reduction if the defendant 
demonstrates positive post-offense 
behavior or rehabilitative efforts, and 
related issues for comment. 
(5) A proposed amendment to the 
Guidelines Manual to simplify the 
procedure for determining the single 
offense level for cases involving 
multiple counts, including replacing the 
five guidelines in Chapter Three, Part D 
with a single guideline at § 3D1.1 that 
provides all the steps necessary to 
determine the single offense level for 
multiple counts, and related issues for 
comment. 
(6) A proposed amendment to the 
Guidelines Manual to delete from 
certain Chapter Two guidelines 26 
specific offense characteristics that 
courts did not apply at all in the last five 
fiscal years and that were applied a 
small number of times—if at all—using 
a 25-year lookback window, and a 
related issue for comment. 
(7) A proposed amendment setting 
forth two options to address specific 
offense characteristics relating to

respond to the Protecting Americans’

Public Law 118–50 (2024), and a related 
issue for comment; (D) amendments to 
Appendix A and the Commentary to

§ 2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, 
and Fraud). 
(9) A proposed amendment making 
technical and other non-substantive 
changes throughout the Guidelines 
Manual. 
In addition, the Commission requests 
public comment regarding whether, 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) and 28 
U.S.C. 994(u), any proposed amendment 
published in this notice should be 
included in subsection (d) of § 1B1.10 
(Reduction in Term of Imprisonment as 
a Result of Amended Guideline Range 
(Policy Statement)) as an amendment 
that may be applied retroactively to 
previously sentenced defendants. The 
Commission lists in § 1B1.10(d) the 
specific guideline amendments that the 
court may apply retroactively under 18 
U.S.C. 3582(c)(2). The Background 
Commentary to § 1B1.10 lists the 
purpose of the amendment, the 
magnitude of the change in the 
guideline range made by the 
amendment, and the difficulty of 
applying the amendment retroactively 
to determine an amended guideline 
range under § 1B1.10(b) as among the 
factors the Commission considers in 
selecting the amendments included in 
§ 1B1.10(d). To the extent practicable, 
public comment should address each of 
these factors. 
The text of the proposed amendments 
and related issues for comment are set 
forth below. Additional information

and issues for comment described in 
this notice may be accessed through the

Proposed Amendments to the 
Sentencing Guidelines, Policy 
Statements, and Official Commentary 
1. Drug Offenses 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: In 
August 2025, the Commission identified 
as one of its policy priorities for the 
amendment cycle ending May 1, 2026, 
‘‘[f]urther examination of the penalty 
structure for certain drug trafficking 
offenses under § 2D1.1 (Unlawful 
Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or 
Trafficking (Including Possession with 
Intent to Commit These Offenses)),’’ 
including ‘‘consideration of possible 
amendments addressing the purity 
distinctions for methamphetamine 
provided in the Drug Quantity Table 
and related application notes’’ and 
‘‘consideration of other miscellaneous 
issues pertaining to drug trafficking 
offenses coming to the Commission’s 
attention, such as statutory changes 
relating to fentanyl, sentencing 
enhancements for offenses involving 
fentanyl, and other fentanyl-related 
issues.’’ U.S. Sent’g Comm’n, ‘‘Notice of 
Final Priorities,’’ 90 FR 39263 (Aug. 14, 
2025). 
This proposed amendment contains 
three parts (Parts A, B, and C). The 
Commission is considering whether to 
promulgate any or all of these parts, as 
they are not mutually exclusive. 
Part A of the proposed amendment 
sets forth two options for amending 
§ 2D1.1 to address the purity distinction 
between methamphetamine in ‘‘actual’’ 
form and methamphetamine as part of a 
mixture. It would also amend § 2D1.1 to 
address offenses involving ‘‘Ice.’’ Issues 
for comment are also included. 
Part B of the proposed amendment 
would amend § 2D1.1 to address the 
enactment of the Halt All Lethal 
Trafficking of Fentanyl Act (HALT 
Fentanyl Act), which permanently 
scheduled ‘‘fentanyl-related 
substances.’’ An issue for comment is 
also provided. 
Part C of the proposed amendment 
would amend § 2D1.1 to add new 
enhancements for offenses involving 
fentanyl and fentanyl analogues. Issues 
for comment are also provided. 
(A) Methamphetamine 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: 
Part A of the proposed amendment sets 
forth two options for amending § 2D1.1 
to address the purity distinction 
between methamphetamine in ‘‘actual’’ 
form and methamphetamine as part of a 
mixture. Part A of the proposed 
amendment also addresses offenses 
involving ‘‘Ice.’’ Both options in Part A 
aim to update the Guidelines Manual’s 
treatment of methamphetamine to 
reflect the evolving nature of 
methamphetamine trafficking, while 
addressing the concerns that animated 
Congress’s decision to set mandatory 
minimum penalties for certain 
methamphetamine trafficking offenses. 
Statutory History of Methamphetamine 
Trafficking Offenses 
The statutory provisions and penalties 
associated with the trafficking of 
methamphetamine are found at 21 
U.S.C. 841 and 960. While the statutory 
penalties for most drug types are based 
solely on drug quantity, the statutory 
penalties for methamphetamine are also 
based on the purity of the substance

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259662 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Notices involved in the offense. Sections 841 
and 960 contain quantity threshold 
triggers for five- and ten-year mandatory 
minimums for methamphetamine 
(actual) (i.e., ‘‘pure’’ methamphetamine) and methamphetamine (mixture) (i.e., 
‘‘a mixture or substance containing a 
detectable amount of 
methamphetamine’’). See 21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)(A)(viii), (B)(viii), 960(b)(1)(H), 
& 960(b)(2)(H). Two different 10-to-1 
quantity ratios set the mandatory 
minimum penalties for 
methamphetamine trafficking offenses. 
First, the quantity of substance 
triggering the ten-year minimum is ten 
times the quantity triggering the five- 
year minimum. Second, the quantity of 
methamphetamine mixture triggering 
each mandatory minimum is set at ten 
times the quantity of methamphetamine 
(actual) triggering the same statutory 
minimum penalty. 
These penalties stem from action 
taken by Congress in 1988 and 1998 to 
address methamphetamine trafficking 
offenses. The record for the Anti-Drug 
Abuse Act of 1988 suggests that 
Congress endeavored to compare 
methamphetamine with other drugs in 
deciding the appropriate mandatory 
minimum threshold quantities, 
ultimately determining that 
methamphetamine ‘‘is a serious and 
common drug of abuse, comparable in 
dangerousness to other controlled 
substances’’ listed in the Anti-Drug 
Abuse Act of 1986. See 134 Cong. Rec. S17,367 (daily ed. Nov. 10, 1988). 
Specifically, Congress cited the 
Department of Justice’s determination 
that the ‘‘quantity of methamphetamine 
that justifies these penalties is the same 
as that currently set forth for PCP’’—the 
only drug in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 
1986 that had a purity distinction. Id. 
Over the next ten years, Congress 
considered changes to the statutory 
penalties for methamphetamine, 
frequently invoking comparisons 
between methamphetamine and crack 
cocaine in terms of the dangers and 
harms associated with the two drugs. 
With the Methamphetamine Trafficking 
Penalty Enhancement Act of 1998, 
Congress halved the quantities of 
methamphetamine set forth in the 1988 
Act to the quantity threshold triggers 
that apply today. In doing so, it enacted 
mandatory minimum quantity 
thresholds for methamphetamine 
(actual) that matched those in place at 
the time for crack cocaine. Although the 
statutory penalties for crack cocaine 
have changed, the same statutory 
penalties for methamphetamine remain 
in place, and as explained below, the 
methamphetamine trafficking guidelines 
are linked to those penalties. 
Guideline History of Methamphetamine 
Trafficking Offenses 
Under § 2D1.1, the base offense level 
for offenses involving 
methamphetamine varies based on the 
purity of the substance. Specifically, the 
Drug Quantity Table at § 2D1.1(c) 
contains three different entries relating 
to methamphetamine: (1) 
‘‘Methamphetamine,’’ which refers to 
the entire weight of a mixture or 
substance containing a detectable 
amount of methamphetamine; (2) 
‘‘Methamphetamine (actual),’’ which 
refers to the weight of 
methamphetamine itself contained in a 
mixture or substance; and (3) ‘‘Ice,’’ 
which is defined as ‘‘a mixture or 
substance containing d- 
methamphetamine hydrochloride of at 
least 80% purity’’ (see USSG § 2D1.1(c) (Note C)). The Drug Quantity Table sets 
base offense levels for 
methamphetamine mixture and 
methamphetamine (actual) in a manner 
that reflects the 10:1 quantity ratio of 
the applicable statutory provisions, such 
that it takes ten times more 
methamphetamine mixture than 
methamphetamine (actual) to trigger the 
same base offense level. 
Although ‘‘Ice’’ is included in the 
guidelines, the term ‘‘Ice’’ does not 
appear in the statutory provisions 
setting penalties for methamphetamine 
offenses. ‘‘Ice’’ was added to the 
guidelines in response to the Crime 
Control Act of 1990, which directed the 
Commission to amend the guidelines 
‘‘for offenses involving smokable crystal 
methamphetamine . . . so that 
convictions for [such offenses] will be 
assigned an offense level . . . two levels 
above that which would have been 
assigned to the same offense involving 
other forms of methamphetamine.’’ See 
Public Law 101–67, 2701 (1990). The 
1990 Act did not, however, define 
‘‘smokable crystal methamphetamine,’’ 
and the Commission and commenters 
struggled to determine its meaning. 
Ultimately, the Commission responded 
to the Act by adding ‘‘Ice’’ to the Drug 
Quantity Table—even though the 1990 
Act did not use that term—and 
developed a definition of ‘‘Ice’’ based on 
the type and purity of 
methamphetamine. See USSG App. C, amend. 370 (effective Nov. 1, 1991). The 
Commission set the base offense levels 
for quantities of ‘‘Ice’’ equal to the base 
offense levels for the same quantities of 
methamphetamine (actual). 
Evolving Nature of Methamphetamine 
Trafficking 
As explained in a recent report 
published by the Commission, there 
have been changes to the trends in 
methamphetamine trafficking in the last 
two decades. When Congress 
established the different statutory 
penalties for methamphetamine (actual) 
and methamphetamine mixture in the 
Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, the 
average purity of the methamphetamine 
being trafficked in the United States was 
seldom greater than 50 percent. At the 
time, individuals sentenced for 
trafficking highly pure 
methamphetamine were considered to 
have a higher function in a drug 
distribution chain, and therefore greater 
culpability in the offense. Since then, 
however, the purity of the 
methamphetamine trafficked in the 
United States has increased 
substantially, and it is now rare to find 
methamphetamine that tests lower than 
90 percent pure. See U.S. Sent’g Comm’n, Methamphetamine Trafficking 
Offenses in the Federal Criminal Justice 
System 3 (2024) at https://
www.ussc.gov/research/research- 
reports/methamphetamine-trafficking- 
offenses-federal-criminal-justice-system. 
Commission data further shows that 
the average purity of methamphetamine 
does not vary significantly based on the 
function of the individual drug 
trafficker. The Commission’s report 
showed that high-level suppliers had 
drugs that were, on average, 95.2 
percent pure, and drug organization 
employees had methamphetamine that 
was 93.3 percent pure. Likewise, an 
individual’s function varied little by the 
primary type of methamphetamine 
involved in the offense, with the 
exception of the function of a drug 
courier. The rate of individuals 
sentenced for trafficking 
methamphetamine (actual) that acted as 
couriers (31.3%) was twice that 
compared to either methamphetamine 
mixture (13.5%) or ‘‘Ice’’ (13.8%). 
While the nature of 
methamphetamine trafficking has 
evolved, so too has the 
methamphetamine trafficking caseload. 
Since fiscal year 2002, the number of 
offenses involving methamphetamine 
mixture has remained relatively steady, 
but the number of offenses involving 
methamphetamine (actual) and ‘‘Ice’’ 
has risen substantially. Offenses 
involving methamphetamine (actual) 
increased 299 percent from 910 offenses 
in fiscal year 2002 to 3,634 offenses in 
fiscal year 2022. As a result, in fiscal 
year 2022, methamphetamine (actual) 
accounted for more than half (52.2%) of

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259663 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Notices all methamphetamine cases. Offenses 
involving ‘‘Ice’’ also have risen during 
the past 20 years. In fiscal year 2002, 
there were 88 offenses involving ‘‘Ice’’ 
in the federal caseload; that number rose 
by 881 percent to 863 offenses in fiscal 
year 2022. Offenses involving ‘‘Ice’’ now 
make up more than ten percent (12.4%) 
of all methamphetamine cases. Offenses 
involving methamphetamine mixture 
comprise roughly a third (35.4%) of all 
methamphetamine cases. See id. at 4, 9, 
18, 32–33, 38–39, 52. 
Feedback From Stakeholders 
The Commission has received 
significant comment regarding § 2D1.1’s 
methamphetamine purity distinction, 
including in response to a proposed 
amendment the Commission published 
last year. See Public Comment on 2025 Proposed Amendments (March 2025) at 
https://www.ussc.gov/policymaking/ 
public-comment/public-comment-2025- 
proposed-amendments. Some commenters suggested that the 
Commission should revisit or eliminate 
the disparity in § 2D1.1’s treatment of 
methamphetamine mixture, on the one 
hand, and methamphetamine (actual) 
and ‘‘Ice,’’ on the other. Most of these 
commenters stated that purity is no 
longer an accurate measure of offense 
culpability because methamphetamine 
today is highly and uniformly pure and 
that ‘‘Ice’’ cases do not involve a higher 
level of purity than other forms of 
methamphetamine. Some of these 
commenters also pointed to disparities 
in testing practices across judicial 
districts, which, in turn, have yielded 
disparate sentences. 
The commenters diverged, however, 
on the action the Commission should 
take to address the 10:1 quantity ratio 
for methamphetamine mixture and 
methamphetamine (actual). Some 
commenters supported setting base 
offense levels for all methamphetamine 
at the level of methamphetamine 
mixture or some lower level, such as at 
the level of cocaine. Other commenters 
supported setting base offense levels for 
all methamphetamine at the level of 
methamphetamine (actual). Still other 
commenters suggested that the 
Commission set the base offense levels 
at a level in between methamphetamine 
mixture and methamphetamine (actual), 
and recommended that the Commission 
undertake additional study of the issues. 
The Commission has since held a 
hearing to study methamphetamine, 
including its chemical structure, 
pharmacological effects, trafficking 
patterns, and community impact, and 
the differences, if any, between 
methamphetamine of varying purity 
levels. 
Proposed Amendment 
Part A of the proposed amendment 
would amend § 2D1.1 to address 
offenses involving ‘‘Ice’’ and the purity 
distinction between methamphetamine 
in ‘‘actual’’ form and methamphetamine 
as part of a mixture. Part A contains two 
options to address the purity 
distinction, both of which aim to 
respond to changes in 
methamphetamine trafficking and 
continue to reflect the dangers and 
harms identified by Congress when it 
set mandatory minimum penalties for 
these offenses. 
Revisions Relating to Methamphetamine 
Purity Distinction 
Part A of the proposed amendment 
sets forth two options to address the 
10:1 quantity ratio for 
methamphetamine mixture and 
methamphetamine (actual). 
Option 1 would set the same quantity 
thresholds for all methamphetamine 
offenses. It would delete all references 
to ‘‘methamphetamine (actual)’’ from 
the Drug Quantity Table at § 2D1.1(c) 
and the Drug Conversion Tables at 
Application Note 8(D). The weight of 
the mixture or substance containing 
methamphetamine that triggers the base 
offense levels would then be the entire 
weight of any mixture or substance 
containing a detectable amount of 
methamphetamine. Option 1 brackets 
four alternatives for the quantity 
thresholds for methamphetamine: (1) 
quantity thresholds matching the 
current quantity thresholds for 
methamphetamine mixture; (2) quantity 
thresholds matching those of fentanyl; 
(3) quantity thresholds matching those 
of cocaine base; and (4) quantity 
thresholds matching the current 
quantity thresholds for 
methamphetamine (actual). This 
approach would simplify § 2D1.1 by 
reducing the number of 
methamphetamine entries in the Drug 
Quantity Table and Drug Conversion 
Tables, while reflecting how 
methamphetamine trafficking has 
changed. 
Option 2 would maintain different 
base offense levels for different 
methamphetamine offenses. It would set 
the baseline quantity thresholds for 
methamphetamine at a level between 
the current quantity thresholds for 
methamphetamine mixture and 
methamphetamine (actual). Option 2 
brackets setting the baseline quantity 
thresholds for methamphetamine at the 
same level as cocaine base. The base 
offense level may be either reduced to 
the current base offense levels for 
methamphetamine mixture and its 
corresponding quantity thresholds if 
[1][2][3] or more of certain factors apply, 
or heightened to the current base offense 
levels for methamphetamine (actual) 
and its corresponding quantity 
thresholds if [1][2][3] or more of certain 
factors apply. Both lists of factors are set 
forth in the Notes to the Drug Quantity 
Table. These factors would reflect the 
concerns that animated Congress when 
it set the statutory minimum penalties 
for methamphetamine trafficking 
offenses. 
Issues for comment for these revisions 
are also provided. 
Revisions Relating to ‘‘Ice’’ 
Part A of the proposed amendment 
would amend the Drug Quantity Table 
at § 2D1.1(c) and the Drug Equivalency 
Tables at Application Note 8(D) of the 
Commentary to § 2D1.1 to delete all 
references to ‘‘Ice.’’ In addition, it would 
add a new specific offense characteristic 
at § 2D1.1(b)(19) that provides a [2]-level 
reduction if the offense involved only 
methamphetamine in a non-smokable, 
non-crystalline form, which would 
continue to ensure compliance with 
Congress’s directive that ‘‘convictions 
for offenses involving smokable crystal 
methamphetamine will be assigned an 
offense level under the guidelines 
which is two levels above’’ other forms 
of methamphetamine. 
An issue for comment relating to 
these revisions is also provided. 
Proposed Amendment: Section 
2D1.1(b) is amended by inserting at the 
end the following new paragraph (19): 
‘‘(19) If the offense involved only 
methamphetamine in a non-smokable, 
non-crystalline form, decrease by [2] 
levels.’’. 
Option 1 (Using a single entry for 
methamphetamine): 
Section 2D1.1(c)(1) is amended by

The Commentary to § 2D1.1 captioned 
‘‘Application Notes’’ is amended in 
Note 8(D), under the heading relating to 
Cocaine and Other Schedule I and II 
Stimulants (and their immediate 
precursors)— 
by striking the line referenced to ‘‘Ice’’ 
as follows: 
‘‘1 gm of ‘Ice’ = 20 kg’’; 
and by striking the lines referenced to 
Methamphetamine and 
Methamphetamine (actual) as follows: 
‘‘1 gm of Methamphetamine = 2 kg 
1 gm of Methamphetamine (actual) = 
20 kg’’, 
and inserting the following lines: 
‘‘1 gm of Methamphetamine (when 
reduced base offense level applies 
under Note (L) of the Notes to the 
Drug Quantity Table) = 2 kg 
1 gm of Methamphetamine (when 
heightened base offense level applies 
under Note (M) of the Notes to the 
Drug Quantity Table) = 20 kg 
1 gm of Methamphetamine (in any 
other case) = [3,571 gm]’’. 
Issues for Comment: 
1. Part A of the proposed amendment 
provides two options with different 
approaches. Option 1 provides a single 
entry for all methamphetamine offenses. 
Option 2, by contrast, sets forth different 
entries for methamphetamine offenses 
depending on the presence of certain 
factors. The Commission seeks general 
comment on which approach, if any, is 
appropriate to address the 10:1 quantity 
ratio for methamphetamine mixture, on 
the one hand, and methamphetamine 
(actual) and ‘‘Ice,’’ on the other. Should 
the Commission use the same quantity 
thresholds for all methamphetamine 
offenses? Should the Commission 
instead retain different quantity 
thresholds for different 
methamphetamine offenses? For 
example, should the Commission set 
baseline quantity thresholds for 
methamphetamine at the current level 
for methamphetamine mixture or at a 
less severe level, and provide for 
heightened base offense levels if certain 
factors apply? Should the Commission 
instead set baseline quantity thresholds 
for methamphetamine at the current 
level for methamphetamine (actual) or 
at a more severe level, and provide for 
reduced base offense levels if certain 
factors apply? 
2. Option 1 brackets four alternatives 
for the quantity thresholds for all 
methamphetamine offenses: (1) quantity 
thresholds matching those of 
methamphetamine mixture; (2) quantity 
thresholds matching those of fentanyl; 
(3) quantity thresholds matching those 
of cocaine base; and (4) quantity 
thresholds matching those of 
methamphetamine (actual). What 
quantity thresholds should the 
Commission adopt for 
methamphetamine, and why? Should 
the Commission adopt quantity 
thresholds for methamphetamine that 
are less severe than the current levels 
for methamphetamine mixture (e.g., 
quantity thresholds matching those of 
cocaine)? 
3. Option 2 brackets setting the 
baseline quantity thresholds that trigger 
base offense levels for 
methamphetamine at the same level as 
cocaine base. These base offense levels 
could be reduced or heightened 
depending on the presence of certain 
factors. Should the Commission adopt a 
different baseline quantity threshold for 
methamphetamine? What is the basis for 
adopting any such baseline quantity 
threshold? Should the Commission 
adopt a different heightened or reduced 
base offense level? What is the basis for 
adopting any such heightened or 
reduced base offense level? 
4. Option 2 sets forth factors that 
would result in the application of 
reduced or heightened base offense 
levels. The Commission seeks comment 
on whether the factors provided in 
Option 2 are appropriate to trigger a 
reduced or heightened base offense 
level. Should any factors be deleted or 
changed? Should the Commission 
provide additional or different factors? 
How many factors should be present in 
the offense to trigger the application of 
the reduced or heightened base offense 
levels? 
5. The Commission seeks comment on 
whether using the factors set forth in 
Option 2 to trigger reduced or 
heightened base offense levels results in 
any inappropriate double-counting. If 
so, what action should the Commission 
take to account for the interaction 
between these factors and the applicable 
base offense level? 
6. Some of the factors set forth in 
Option 2 are not specific offense 
characteristics or adjustments in the 
Guidelines Manual. If the Commission 
includes factors that are not in the 
Guidelines Manual, will it result in any 
fact-finding or administrability issues? 
7. Both options would delete all 
references in § 2D1.1 to ‘‘Ice’’ and add 
a new specific offense characteristic at 
§ 2D1.1(b)(19) that provides a [2]-level 
reduction if the offense involved only 
methamphetamine in a non-smokable, 
non-crystalline form. This new specific 
offense characteristic is intended to 
ensure compliance with the 1990 
congressional directive (Pub. L. 101–67, 
2701 (1990)). The Commission invites 
comment on whether the Commission 
should take an alternative approach to 
ensure compliance with the 1990 
congressional directive.

the same level as fentanyl analogues. 
The Act defined ‘‘fentanyl-related 
substances’’ as 
(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), 
except as provided in paragraph (3), the 
term ‘‘fentanyl-related substance’’ 
means any substance that is structurally 
related to fentanyl by 1 or more of the 
following modifications: 
(A) By replacement of the phenyl 
portion of the phenethyl group by any 
monocycle, whether or not further 
substituted in or on the monocycle. 
(B) By substitution in or on the 
phenethyl group with alkyl, alkenyl,

(D) By replacement of the aniline ring 
with any aromatic monocycle whether 
or not further substituted in or on the

Attorney General under section 201; or 
(B) is otherwise expressly listed in a 
schedule other than this schedule. 
Public Law 119–26, 2 (2025). The 
HALT Fentanyl Act does not contain 
any directives to the Commission. 
Part B of the proposed amendment 
would amend the Drug Quantity Table 
at subsection (c) § 2D1.1 (Unlawful 
Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or 
Trafficking (Including Possession with 
Intent to Commit These Offenses); 
Attempt or Conspiracy) and the Drug 
Equivalency Tables at Application Note 
8(D) of the Commentary to § 2D1.1 to 
add ‘‘fentanyl-related substance.’’ It 
would set the quantity thresholds and 
base offense levels at the same level as 
fentanyl analogues. Part B of the 
proposed amendment would also 
amend the Notes to the Drug Quantity 
Table to add a definition of ‘‘fentanyl- 
related substance’’ that closely tracks 
the statutory definition. 
In addition, Part B of the proposed 
amendment would add ‘‘fentanyl- 
related substance’’ to the enhancement 
at § 2D1.1(b)(13) for representing or 
marketing fentanyl or a fentanyl 
analogue as another substance or as a 
legitimately manufactured drug. 
An issue for comment is also 
provided.

The Commission invites comment on 
whether this is the appropriate 
approach. Should the quantity 
thresholds and base offense levels for 
fentanyl-related substances instead be 
set at the same level as fentanyl, another 
substance in the Drug Quantity Table, or 
some other level entirely? If so, why? 
How are fentanyl-related substances 
similar to or different from other 
substances in the Drug Quantity Table, 
including fentanyl or fentanyl 
analogues? How do the effects of 
fentanyl-related substances compare 
with the effects of other substances in 
the Drug Quantity Table, including 
fentanyl or fentanyl analogues? 
(C) Enhancements for Offenses 
Involving Fentanyl or Fentanyl 
Analogues 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: 
Fentanyl and fentanyl analogue cases 
have increased substantially over the 
last several years. Since fiscal year 2020, 
fentanyl cases have increased 255.7 
percent, such that they comprised 20.2 
percent of all federal drug trafficking 
cases in fiscal year 2024. Today, 
fentanyl represents the second most 
common drug type in federal drug 
trafficking cases. Fentanyl analogue 
cases occupy a much smaller portion of 
the federal drug trafficking caseload 
(1.9%), but those cases have increased 
85.2 percent since fiscal year 2020. 
In response to rising numbers of 
fentanyl and fentanyl analogue cases, 
the Commission previously undertook a 
multi-year study of synthetic controlled 
substances. In 2018, following that 
study, the Commission amended 
§ 2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, 
Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking 
(Including Possession with Intent to 
Commit Those Offenses); Attempt or 
Conspiracy) to add an enhancement 
specific to fentanyl and fentanyl 
analogue cases. In particular, the 
Commission added a new specific 
offense characteristic at subsection 
(b)(13) providing a 4-level increase 
when the defendant knowingly 
misrepresented or knowingly marketed 
as another substance a mixture or 
substance containing fentanyl or a 
fentanyl analogue. See USSG, App. C. amend. 807 (effective Nov. 1, 2018). In 
adding this new specific offense 
characteristic, the Commission pointed 
to the harm attendant to cases where a 
user does not know the substance they 
are using contains fentanyl or a fentanyl 
analogue. Id. As the Commission explained, ‘‘[b]ecause of fentanyl’s 
extreme potency, the risk of overdose 
death is great, particularly when the 
user is inexperienced or unaware of 
what substance he or she is using.’’ Id. 
Thus, the Commission concluded that 
‘‘it is appropriate for traffickers who 
knowingly misrepresent fentanyl or a 
fentanyl analogue as another substance 
to receive additional punishment.’’ Id. 
In 2023, the Commission amended 
§ 2D1.1(b)(13) based on the continued 
increase in fentanyl and fentanyl 
analogue distribution. See USSG, App. C. amend. 818 (effective Nov. 1, 2023). 
The amendment added a new 
subparagraph (B) with an alternative 2- 
level enhancement for offenses where 
the defendant represented or marketed 
as a legitimately manufactured drug 
another mixture or substance containing 
fentanyl or a fentanyl analogue, and 
acted with willful blindness or 
conscious avoidance of knowledge that 
such mixture or substance was not the 
legitimately manufactured drug. Id. As grounds for the amendment, the 
Commission cited data from the Drug 
Enforcement Administration (‘‘DEA’’) 
showing a substantial increase in the 
seizure of fake prescription pills. Id. The DEA reported seizing over 50.6 million 
fake pills in calendar year 2022, with 70 
percent containing fentanyl. Id. Of those seized pills containing fentanyl, six out 
of ten contained a potentially lethal 
dose of the substance. Id. The Commission also pointed to the increase 
in drug overdose deaths—most of which 
involved synthetic opioids, primarily 
fentanyl. Id. In 2025, the Commission amended 
§ 2D1.1(b)(13)(B) to change the mens rea 
requirement. See USSG, App. C. amend. 833 (effective Nov. 1, 2025). The 
Commission received comment that 
§ 2D1.1(b)(13)(B) was being applied 
inconsistently, in part, because the 
mens rea requirement generated 
confusion. In particular, commenters 
urged the Commission to revise 
§ 2D1.1(b)(13)(B) because the mental 
state of ‘‘willful blindness or conscious 
avoidance of knowledge’’ was vague, 
and courts construed willful blindness 
as legally equivalent to knowledge, 
causing uncertainty over when the 
enhancement should be applied. The 
Commission further heard concerns 
about the continuing dangers associated 
with representing or marketing fentanyl 
or a fentanyl analogue as a legitimately 
manufactured drug. Informed by those 
concerns, the Commission changed the 
mens rea requirement in 
§ 2D1.1(b)(13)(B) from ‘‘willful 
blindness or conscious avoidance of 
knowledge’’ to ‘‘reckless disregard.’’ 
The Commission has continued to 
receive comment on whether the 
guidelines appropriately account for 
factors specific to offenses involving 
fentanyl and fentanyl analogues. Earlier 
this year, the Commission sought public 
comment on several amendments 
proposed by the Department of Justice 
to address the harm in cases involving 
fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, and other 
opioids. See U.S. Sent’g Comm’n, ‘‘Request for public comment,’’ 90 FR 
8840 (Feb. 3, 2025); see also Letter from 
Scott Meisler, Ex-Officio Member, U.S. Sent’g Comm’n, to Hon. Carlton W. 
Reeves, Chair, U.S. Sent’g Comm’n (July 
15, 2024) at 5, available at https://
www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/ 
amendment-process/public-comment/ 
202407/89FR48029_public-comment_R.pdf. Specifically, the Commission sought comment on whether it should 
create enhancements under § 2D1.1 for: 
(1) distribution of fentanyl, fentanyl 
analogues, and other opioids to 
individuals under the age of 21; (2) 
fentanyl, fentanyl analogue, and opioid 
offenses involving the use of the dark 
web or other anonymizing technologies; 
and (3) drug trafficking offenses 
involving fentanyl or another synthetic 
opioid adulterated with xylazine or 
medetomidine. Some commenters 
supported the proposed enhancements 
or asked the Commission to expand the 
enhancements to apply more broadly, 
while others opposed the proposed 
enhancements or asked the Commission 
to limit the enhancements to apply more 
narrowly. 
In response to these concerns, Part C 
of the proposed amendment would 
amend § 2D1.1 to add four new specific 
offense characteristics that increase 
offense levels in fentanyl and fentanyl 
analogue trafficking cases involving 
certain factors. The Commission is 
considering each of these specific 
offense characteristics individually and 
whether to promulgate any of these 
specific offense characteristics or a 
combination of them. 
First, Part C of the proposed 
amendment would add a new specific 
offense characteristic at § 2D1.1(b)(14) 
relating to the distribution of fentanyl or 
a fentanyl analogue to an individual less 
than [18][21] years of age or the use or 
attempted use of an individual less than 
[18][21] years of age to commit an 
offense involving such substance. For 
this enhancement to apply, the 
defendant must be, at the time of the 
offense, [at least [4][6][8] years 
older][substantially older] than the 
individual less than [18][21] years of 
age. Part C brackets alternatives for 
making the enhancement defendant- 
based or offense-based. The defendant- 
based alternative of this enhancement 
also brackets a mens rea requirement of 
knowledge relating to the age of the 
individual and to the substance 
involved in the offense.

amendment would add a new specific 
offense characteristic at § 2D1.1(b)(15) 
relating to the use of the dark web or 
darknets to facilitate the commission or 
concealment of an offense involving 
fentanyl or a fentanyl analogue. It also 
brackets alternatives for making the 
enhancement defendant-based or

Third, Part C of the proposed 
amendment would add a new specific 
offense characteristic at § 2D1.1(b)(16) 
relating to the distribution of a mixture 
or substance containing (A) fentanyl or 
a fentanyl analogue and (B) xylazine. It 
brackets alternatives for making the 
enhancement defendant-based or 
offense-based. 
Finally, Part C of the proposed 
amendment would add a new specific 
offense characteristic at § 2D1.1(b)(17) 
relating to the use or possession of a 
tableting machine or an encapsulating 
machine for the purpose of 
manufacturing fentanyl or a fentanyl 
analogue. It brackets alternatives for 
making the enhancement defendant- 
based or offense-based. 
Issues for comment are also provided. 
Proposed Amendment: 
[Part C of the proposed amendment 
would insert any, a combination, or all 
of the following paragraphs to 
§ 2D1.1(b) and redesignate current 
paragraphs (14) through (18) 
accordingly. In addition, it would make 
conforming changes in accordance with 
the redesignation of these paragraphs.] 
Section 2D1.1(b) is amended by 
inserting the following new 
paragraph(s): 
‘‘(14) [If the defendant[, knowing that 
an individual was less than [18][21] 
years of age and that the substance 
involved in the offense was fentanyl (N- 
phenyl-N-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4- 
piperidinyl] propanamide) or a fentanyl 
analogue]— 
(A) (i) distributed fentanyl (N-phenyl- 
N-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl] 
propanamide) or a fentanyl analogue to 
that individual, and (ii) the defendant 
was [at least [4][6][8] years 
older][substantially older] than that 
individual at the time of the offense; or 
(B) (i) used or attempted to use that 
individual to commit an offense 
involving fentanyl (N-phenyl-N-[1-(2- 
phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl] 
propanamide) or a fentanyl analogue, 
and (ii) the defendant was [at least 
[4][6][8] years older][substantially older] 
than that individual at the time of the 
offense, 
increase by [2][4] levels. For purposes 
of subsection (b)(14)(B), ‘used or 
attempted to use’ includes directing, 
commanding, encouraging, 
intimidating, counseling, training, 
procuring, recruiting, or soliciting.] 
[If the offense involved— 
(A) (i) the distribution of fentanyl (N- 
phenyl-N-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4- 
piperidinyl] propanamide) or a fentanyl 
analogue to an individual less than 
[18][21] years of age, and (ii) the 
defendant was [at least [4][6][8] years 
older][substantially older] than that 
individual at the time of the offense; or 
(B) (i) using or attempting to use an 
individual less than [18][21] years of age

analogue, and (ii) the defendant was [at 
least [4][6][8] years older][substantially 
older] than that individual at the time 
of the offense, 
increase by [2][4] levels. For purposes 
of subsection (b)(14)(B), ‘using or 
attempting to use’ includes directing, 
commanding, encouraging, 
intimidating, counseling, training, 
procuring, recruiting, or soliciting.] 
(15) If [the defendant used][the 
offense involved the use of] the dark 
web or darknets (i.e., part of the internet hidden from the general public that 
cannot be accessed by traditional search 
engines or web browsers and allows its 
users to hide their identity and location 
from other people and from law 
enforcement) to facilitate the 
commission or concealment of an 
offense involving fentanyl (N-phenyl-N- 
[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl] 
propanamide) or a fentanyl analogue, 
increase by [2][4] levels. 
(16) [If the defendant knowingly 
distributed a mixture or substance 
containing (A) fentanyl (N-phenyl-N-[1- 
(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl] 
propanamide) or a fentanyl analogue,

purpose of manufacturing fentanyl (N- 
phenyl-N-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4- 
piperidinyl] propanamide) or a fentanyl 
analogue, increase by [2][4]levels.’’. 
The Commentary to § 2D1.1 captioned 
‘‘Application Notes’’ is amended by 
inserting the following new Note 18: 
‘‘18. Application of Subsection (b)(14).— 
(A) Interaction with Subsection (b)(20).—Do not apply subsection (b)(14) 
if subsection (b)(20)(B) also applies. 
(B) Interaction with Chapter Three Adjustment.—If the conduct that forms 
the basis for an enhancement under 
subsection (b)(14) is the only conduct 
that forms the basis for an adjustment 
under § 3B1.4 (Using a Minor to Commit 
a Crime), do not apply that adjustment 
under § 3B1.4.’’. 
[Part C of the proposed amendment 
would renumber current notes 18 
through 26 accordingly. In addition, it 
would make conforming changes in 
accordance with the redesignation of 
these notes.] 
Issues for Comment: 
1. Part C of the proposed amendment 
would amend § 2D1.1 (Unlawful 
Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or 
Trafficking (Including Possession with 
Intent to Commit These Offenses); 
Attempt or Conspiracy) to add four new 
specific offense characteristics that 
increase offense levels in fentanyl and 
fentanyl analogue trafficking cases 
involving certain factors. The 
Commission invites general comment 
on whether the proposed enhancements 
are appropriate to address the factors 
involved in fentanyl and fentanyl 
analogue trafficking cases, including the 
harm and the culpability of the 
defendants in these cases. If not, should 
the Commission take another approach 
to address these factors? 
2. The proposed specific offense 
characteristics set forth in Part C of the 
proposed amendment would apply to 
offenses involving fentanyl or a fentanyl 
analogue. Part B of the proposed 
amendment would add references to 
‘‘fentanyl-related substances’’ to the 
Drug Quantity Table and Drug 
Conversion Tables in § 2D1.1. If the 
Commission were to promulgate Part B 
of the proposed amendment, should the 
Commission also add fentanyl-related 
substances to the proposed specific 
offense characteristics set forth in this 
Part? 
3. The proposed enhancement at 
§ 2D1.1(b)(14) for offenses involving 
distributing fentanyl or a fentanyl 
analogue to an individual less than 
[18][21] years of age, or using an 
individual less than [18][21] years of age 
in the offense, contains a condition 
requiring that the defendant must be [at 
least [4][6][8] years older][substantially 
older] than the individual less than 
[18][21] years of age. The Commission 
seeks comment on whether it should 
include such a requirement. Is the 
requirement appropriate to address 
cases involving a defendant who is a 
peer or similar in age to an individual 
less than [18][21] years of age? If not,

make to the proposed enhancement? 
4. The Commission published a 
proposed amendment setting forth a 
new Chapter Three adjustment at 
§ 3C1.5 addressing offenses involving 
sophisticated means. If the Commission 
were to promulgate such an adjustment, 
should it affect the Commission’s 
consideration of the proposed 
enhancement at § 2D1.1(b)(15) relating 
to the use of the dark web or darknets? 
If so, how? 
5. Part C of the proposed amendment 
would add a new specific offense 
characteristic at § 2D1.1(b)(16) relating 
to the distribution of a mixture or 
substance containing (A) fentanyl or a 
fentanyl analogue and (B) xylazine. The 
Commission seeks comment on whether 
the proposed enhancement is 
appropriate. The Commission also seeks 
comment on whether there are other 
adulterants with similar effects (e.g., 
medetomidine) to which the 
enhancement should apply. 
6. The proposed enhancement at 
§ 2D1.1(b)(17) provides that this 
enhancement shall not apply if the 
enhancement at § 2D1.1(b)(13) applies. 
The Commission seeks comment on the 
interaction between these two 
enhancements. Does the proposed 
enhancement at § 2D1.1(b)(17) capture 
conduct and harm that the current 
enhancement at § 2D1.1(b)(13) does not? 
2. Inflationary Adjustments 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: 
This proposed amendment is a result of 
the Commission’s work in examining 
§ 2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, 
and Fraud) and related guidelines to 
consider whether the loss table should 
be revised to simplify application or to 
adjust for inflation. See U.S. Sent’g Comm’n, ‘‘Notice of Final Priorities,’’ 90 
FR 39263 (Aug. 14, 2025). As part of 
that work, the Commission is 
considering whether to adjust all 
monetary tables and values in the 
guidelines for inflation. 
The monetary tables and values in the 
guidelines, including the monetary 
values in the fine tables for individual 
defendants and for organizational 
defendants, were last revised to account 
for inflation in 2015. See USSG App. C, amend. 791 (effective Nov. 1, 2015). The 
proposed amendment would amend the 
monetary tables in the guidelines to 
adjust for inflation, i.e., the tables in §§ 2B1.1 (Theft, Property, Destruction, 
and Fraud), 2B2.1 (Burglary), 2B3.1 
(Robbery), 2R1.1 (Bid-Rigging, Price- 
Fixing or Market-Allocation Agreements 
Among Competitors), 2T4.1 (Tax Table), 
5E1.2 (Fines for Individual Defendants), 
and 8C2.4 (Base Fine). The proposed 
amendment would adjust the monetary 
tables and values in the guidelines using 
a specific multiplier derived from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer 
Price Index and then would round the 
amounts using a set of rules 
extrapolated from the provisions for 
adjusting monetary penalties for 
inflation set forth in section 5(a) of the 
Federal Civil Penalties Inflation 
Adjustment Act of 1990. This is the 
same methodology the Commission 
used in 2015. See USSG App. C, amend. 791 (effective Nov. 1, 2015). 
In addition, the proposed amendment 
adjusts for inflation the monetary value 
in specific offense characteristics in 
other Chapter Two guidelines and 
includes conforming changes to 
guidelines that refer to the monetary 
tables. 
Issues for comment are also provided.

Issues for Comment 
1. The Commission seeks comment on 
whether the monetary tables in the 
guidelines should be adjusted for 
inflation. The monetary tables set forth 
in the proposed amendment relate to a 
variety of different offenses and apply to 
a number of different criminal statutes. 
Given the difference between the types 
of offenses, should all monetary tables 
be adjusted for inflation? Do the types 
of offenses or statutory provisions 
related to any of the monetary tables 
suggest that it should not be adjusted for 
inflation? 
2. The Commission seeks comment on 
whether the monetary tables in the 
guidelines should be adjusted on a 
regular basis, such as on an annual, five- 
year, or ten-year basis, or at particular 
inflationary measures, such as when 
$1.00 in the year the table was last 
adjusted has the same buying power as 
$1.25 or $1.33 or $1.50 in the current 
year? Should the Commission 
incorporate directly into the guidelines 
a mechanism for automatically adjusting 
for inflation? Would the incorporation 
of such a mechanism be consistent with 
the Commission’s statutory authority? 
3. Economic Crimes 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: In 
August 2025, the Commission identified 
as one of its policy priorities for the 
amendment cycle ending May 1, 2026, 
‘‘[e]xamination of § 2B1.1 (Theft, 
Property Destruction, and Fraud) and 
related guidelines to ensure the 
guidelines appropriately reflect the 
culpability of the individual and the 
harm to the victim, including [] 
reassessing the role of actual loss, 
intended loss, and gain[, ] considering 
whether the loss table in § 2B1.1 should 
be revised to simplify application or to 
adjust for inflation,’’ and ‘‘possible 
consideration of amendments that might 
be appropriate.’’ U.S. Sent’g Comm’n, 
‘‘Notice of Final Priorities,’’ 90 FR 
39263 (Aug. 14, 2025). 
This proposed amendment contains 
two parts (Parts A and B). The 
Commission is considering whether to 
promulgate either or both of these parts, 
as they are not mutually exclusive. 
Part A of the proposed amendment 
would restructure the loss table at 
§ 2B1.1(b)(1) to simplify application of 
the table. Issues for comment are also 
provided. 
Part B of the proposed amendment 
would amend existing specific offense 
characteristics (SOCs) and add new 
SOCs to § 2B1.1 to reflect the culpability 
of the individual and harm to the 
victim. Issues for comment are also 
provided. 
(A) Restructuring the Loss Table 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: 
The loss table at § 2B1.1(b)(1) provides 
a tiered enhancement based on the 
amount of loss resulting from the 
offense. Currently, there are 16 levels 
resulting in either no increase or an 
increase of up to 30 levels. 
The Commission has received 
comment from some stakeholders 
advocating revising the loss table to 
simplify application and reduce the 
fact-finding burden on courts. Part A of 
the proposed amendment seeks to 
accomplish this by reducing the number 
of levels in the table. By reducing the 
number of levels in the table, the 
Commission seeks to ease the court’s 
burden in cases involving a loss amount 
near the margins of two levels. 
As a starting point, Part A of the 
proposed amendment restructures the 
loss table with wider ranges based on an 
analysis of the loss amount attributed to 
each sentenced individual in fiscal year 
2024, creating five groups (or quintiles), 
with the loss amount for each group 
representing approximately 20 percent 
of the individuals sentenced under 
§ 2B1.1. 
For individuals sentenced in fiscal 
year 2024, the data show that for 
approximately 20 percent of individuals 
sentenced under § 2B1.1, the offense 
involved $15,000 or less of loss, 
resulting in either no enhancement or a 
2-level enhancement; approximately 20 
percent involved between $15,000 and 
$95,000, resulting in a 4- or 6-level 
enhancement; approximately 20 percent 
involved between $95,000 and 
$250,000, resulting in an 8- or 10-level 
enhancement; approximately 20 percent 
involved between $250,000 and 
$1,500,000, resulting in a 12- or 14-level 
enhancement; and approximately 20 
percent involved more than $1,500,000 
of loss, resulting in an enhancement 
ranging from 16 to 30-levels. 
Part A of the proposed amendment 
would consolidate the loss table so that 
each of the first five levels would 
account for approximately 20 percent (a 
quintile) of cases sentenced under 
§ 2B1.1 as reflected by the data 
described above. It also brackets the 
possibility of amending the offense level 
enhancement associated with each 
category. Under the revised table, 
offenses involving $15,000 of loss or 
less would receive no increase, offenses 
involving more than $15,000 of loss 
would receive a [4]-level increase, 
offenses involving more than $95,000 of 
loss would receive an [8]-level increase, 
offenses involving more than $250,000 
of loss would receive a [12]-level 
increase, and offenses involving more 
than $1,500,000 of loss would receive a 
[16]-level increase. 
The revised table retains the loss 
categories in the top quintile for 
offenses involving more than 
$9,500,000, $65,000,000, and 
$250,000,000 while bracketing the 
possibility of amending the associated 
offense level enhancements. These 
categories are retained to provide an 
offense level increase for individuals 
with the highest loss amounts. 
The proposed amendment includes 
conforming changes to guidelines that 
refer to the loss table at § 2B1.1. 
Issues for comment are also provided. 
Proposed Amendment: 
Section 2B1.1 is amended by striking 
the following:

Issues for Comment 
1. The Commission seeks comment on 
whether the restructured loss table 
sufficiently accounts for the financial 
harm in economic crime offenses. 
Would the proposed revisions to the 
loss table advance the Commission’s 
goals of simplifying application and 
reducing the court’s fact-finding 
burden? What are the advantages and 
disadvantages of broader categories of 
loss? Are there other approaches the 
Commission should consider? 
2. Part A of the proposed amendment 
would amend the loss table by 
establishing a loss exceeding $15,000 as 
the threshold to trigger an enhancement. 
The Commission seeks comment on 
whether this amount is the appropriate 
threshold to trigger an enhancement 
under the table. If not, what amount 
should it be? 
3. Part A of the proposed amendment 
would maintain the offense level 
enhancement associated with each of 
the remaining loss categories. The 
Commission seeks comment on whether 
the offense level enhancements should 
be revised to account for the 
restructuring of the loss table. If so, how 
should they be revised? That is, what is 
the increase in offense level that should 
result from each loss category? 
(B) Culpability Factors 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: A 
wide variety of economic crimes are 
referenced to § 2B1.1. To account for the 
range of conduct, § 2B1.1 contains 20 
specific offense characteristics (SOCs) 
and four cross-references to other 
guidelines. 
Among the 20 SOCs is a provision 
providing a tiered enhancement based 
on the number of victims and the level 
of financial hardship to those victims 
resulting from the offense. USSG 
§ 2B1.1(b)(2). There is also an 
enhancement if the individual 
committed the offense using 
‘‘sophisticated means.’’ USSG 
§ 2B1.1(b)(10)(C). 
The Commission has heard from some 
stakeholders that § 2B1.1 does not 
appropriately reflect the culpability of 
sentenced individuals or the harm 
experienced by the victims. Specifically, 
some stakeholders have suggested that 
the guidelines should measure an 
individual’s culpability by considering 
the non-economic harm to victims, in 
addition to the economic impact and 
number of victims. Additionally, some 
stakeholders have asked the 
Commission to consider amending the 
sophisticated means enhancement 
because, in their view, the enhancement 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:58 Dec 18, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\19DEN2.SGM 19DEN2
lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259678 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Notices is applied too broadly and for conduct 
that is not complex or intricate. These 
stakeholders suggest that the 
enhancement is often based on conduct 
that is inherent in economic crime 
offenses and therefore is captured by the 
base offense level. Some stakeholders 
have also noted that the enhancement is 
not applied uniformly because the 
guidelines do not provide a clear 
standard. Some stakeholders have also 
expressed concern that § 2B1.1 does not 
adequately account for mitigating 
factors for individuals with limited 
involvement in the offense. 
Part B of the proposed amendment 
seeks to address these concerns. 
Part B of the proposed amendment 
would create a new specific offense 
characteristic at § 2B1.1(b)(3) by adding 
an enhancement for offenses that 
resulted in substantial non-economic 
harm to one or more victims. The 
amendment brackets the possibility of a 
2-, 3-, or 4-level enhancement. It would 
also provide a list of examples of ‘‘non- 
economic harm,’’ including physical 
harm, psychological harm, emotional 
trauma, harm to reputation or credit 
rating, and invasion of privacy. 
Part B of the proposed amendment 
would amend the sophisticated means 
enhancement at renumbered 
§ 2B1.1(b)(11). It would revise the 
definition of ‘‘sophisticated means’’ to 
mean ‘‘committing or concealing an 
offense with a greater level of 
complexity than typical for an offense of 
that nature’’ and provide further 
guidance for courts to use when 
determining whether conduct fits the 
definition. Additionally, the definition 
of ‘‘United States,’’ as it applies to the 
provision, would be moved from the 
commentary to the text of the guideline. 
Part B of the proposed amendment 
would also add two mitigating factors. 
The first would provide for a [2]-level 
decrease if the defendant committed the 
offense at the direction of his or her 
employer for fear of negative 
employment consequences; was 
motivated by an intimate or familial 
relationship or by threats or fear to 
commit the offense and was otherwise 
unlikely to commit such an offense; or 
was unusually vulnerable to being 
persuaded or induced to commit the 
offense due to a physical or mental 
condition. The second mitigating factor 
would provide for a tiered decrease 
based on whether, prior to the 
defendant’s knowledge of the criminal 
investigation or prosecution for the 
offense, the defendant voluntarily 
ceased the criminal activity, made 
efforts to return the money or property 
to the victim, or reported the offense to 
appropriate governmental authorities. 
Additionally, the § 2B1.1 specific 
offense characteristics vary widely in 
frequency of use. As part of its ongoing 
efforts to simplify the Guidelines 
Manual, the Commission is considering deleting three specific offense 
characteristics that courts have applied 
infrequently (fewer than 1% of cases) in 
the last five fiscal years: § 2B1.1(b)(3), 
(4), and (13). 
Issues for comment are also provided. 
Proposed Amendment: 
Section 2B1.1(b) is amended— 
by redesignating paragraphs (3) through 
(20) as paragraphs (4) through (21), 
respectively; 
by inserting after paragraph (2) the 
following new paragraph (3): 
‘‘(3) If the offense resulted in 
substantial non-economic harm to one 
or more victims, increase by [2][3][4] 
levels. For purposes of this provision, 
‘non-economic harm’ includes such 
harms as physical harm, psychological 
harm, emotional trauma, harm to 
reputation or credit rating, and invasion 
of privacy interest.’’; 
in paragraph (11) (as so redesignated) 
by inserting at the end the following: 
‘‘For purposes of this provision: 
‘Sophisticated means’ means 
committing or concealing an offense 
with a greater level of complexity than 
typical for an offense of that nature. 
Such complexity may be achieved 
through various methods, including by 
using advanced or emerging 
technologies [in ways not routinely 
employed by everyday users][in a more 
specialized, elaborate, or unusual way 
than an ordinary user would]. 
Sophisticated means are often used to 
increase the scale of the offense or to 
make especially difficult the detection 
of the offense [or the detection of the 
defendant’s participation in the offense]. 
‘United States’ means each of the 50 
states, the District of Columbia, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the 
United States Virgin Islands, Guam, the 
Northern Mariana Islands, and 
American Samoa.’’; 
in paragraph (18)(C) (as so 
redesignated) by striking ‘‘subsections 
(b)(2) and (b)(17)(B)’’ and inserting 
‘‘subsections (b)(2) and (b)(18)(B)’’; 
and by inserting at the end the 
following new paragraphs (22) and (23): 
‘‘(22) If the defendant (A) committed 
the offense at the direction of his or her 
employer for fear of negative 
employment consequences; (B) was 
motivated by an intimate or familial 
relationship or by threats or fear to 
commit the offense and was otherwise 
unlikely to commit such an offense; or 
(C) was unusually vulnerable to being 
persuaded or induced to commit the 
offense due to a physical or mental 
condition, decrease by [2] levels. 
(23) (Apply the greatest) If, prior to 
the defendant’s knowledge of the 
criminal investigation or prosecution for 
the offense, the defendant— 
(A) voluntarily ceased the criminal 
activity, [returned the money or 
property to the victim][made a good 
faith effort to the maximum extent 
possible to return the money or property 
to the victim], and reported the offense 
to appropriate governmental authorities, 
decrease by [2][4][6] levels; 
(B) voluntarily ceased the criminal 
activity and [returned the money or 
property to the victim][made a good 
faith effort to the maximum extent 
possible to return the money or property 
to the victim], decrease by [2][4] levels; 
or 
(C) voluntarily ceased the criminal 
activity, decrease by [2] levels.’’.

105–318. This subsection focuses 
principally on an aggravated form of 
identity theft known as ‘affirmative 
identity theft’ or ‘breeding’, in which a 
defendant uses another individual’s 
name, social security number, or some 
other form of identification (the ‘means 
of identification’) to ‘breed’ (i.e., 
produce or obtain) new or additional 
forms of identification. Because 18 
U.S.C. 1028(d) broadly defines ‘means 
of identification’, the new or additional 
forms of identification can include 
items such as a driver’s license, a credit 
card, or a bank loan. This subsection 
provides a minimum offense level of 
level 12, in part because of the 
seriousness of the offense. The 
minimum offense level accounts for the 
fact that the means of identification that 
were ‘bred’ (i.e., produced or obtained) often are within the defendant’s 
exclusive control, making it difficult for 
the individual victim to detect that the 
victim’s identity has been ‘stolen.’ 
Generally, the victim does not become 
aware of the offense until certain harms 
have already occurred (e.g., a damaged credit rating or an inability to obtain a 
loan). The minimum offense level also 
accounts for the non-monetary harm 
associated with these types of offenses, 
much of which may be difficult or 
impossible to quantify (e.g., harm to the individual’s reputation or credit rating, 
inconvenience, and other difficulties 
resulting from the offense). The 
legislative history of the Identity Theft 
and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 
indicates that Congress was especially 
concerned with providing increased 
punishment for this type of harm.

The Commentary to § 2J1.1 captioned

Issues for Comment 
1. The Commission seeks comment on 
whether Part B of the proposed 
amendment’s addition of new 
subsection (b)(3) adequately addresses 
substantial non-economic harm to 
victims. If not, what additional factors 
or other provisions should the 
Commission include to address those 
harms? 
How should this new enhancement 
interact with other provisions in § 2B1.1 
(Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud) 
that account for harm to victims? For 
example, how should this new 
enhancement interact with the victims 
table in subsection (b)(2), the 
enhancement for theft from the person 
of another in renumbered subsection 
(b)(4), the enhancement for means of 
identification in renumbered subsection 
(b)(12), and the enhancement for 
unauthorized public dissemination of 
personal information in renumbered 
subsection (b)(19)(B)? Should this new 
enhancement be cumulative with the 
victims table and the other 
enhancements, or should the 
Commission reduce the cumulative 
impact of these various provisions? 
2. Part B of the proposed amendment 
would amend the definition of 
‘‘sophisticated means’’ to mean 
‘‘committing or concealing an offense 
with a greater level of complexity than 
typical for an offense of that nature.’’ It 
would also include a provision stating 
that the complexity required by the 
‘‘sophisticated means’’ definition ‘‘may 
be achieved through various methods, 
including by using advanced or 
emerging technologies [in ways not 
routinely employed by everyday 
users][in a more specialized, elaborate, 
or unusual way than an ordinary user 
would].’’ The Commission seeks 
comment on whether the proposed 
amended definition of ‘‘sophisticated 
means’’ is the appropriate definition. Is 
it an improvement over the current 
definition? Should the Commission 
provide guidance regarding the level of 
complexity that is typical for an offense 
of that nature? If so, what type of 
guidance should the Commission 
provide? Further, should the 
Commission provide additional 
guidance on what should be considered 
‘‘advanced or emerging technologies’’ or 
on how such technologies must be used 
for purposes of applying the proposed 
definition? If so, what guidance should 
the Commission provide? 
Additionally, Part B of the proposed 
amendment brackets the possibility of 
maintaining the examples of 
‘‘sophisticated means’’ provided in 
Application Note 9, providing that, in a 
telemarketing scheme, locating the main 
office of the scheme in one jurisdiction 
but locating soliciting operations in 
another jurisdiction ordinarily indicates 
sophisticated means and that conduct 
such as hiding assets or transactions, or 
both, through the use of fictitious 
entities, corporate shells, or offshore 
financial accounts also ordinarily 
indicates sophisticated means. If the 
Commission amends the definition of 
‘‘sophisticated means,’’ should the 
Commission maintain these examples? 
If not, should the Commission add 
additional factors or other provisions to 
the definition of ‘‘sophisticated means’’?

would add to § 2B1.1 a new [2]-level 
reduction at subsection (b)(22) if the 
individual committed the offense under 
coercion or duress. The Commission 
seeks comment on whether this new 
adjustment should apply more narrowly 
or more broadly. The Commission also 
seeks comment on whether the criteria 
provided for this new reduction are 
appropriate. Should any criterion be 
deleted or changed? Should the 
Commission provide additional or 
different criteria? 
4. Part B of the proposed amendment 
would add to § 2B1.1 a new tiered 
reduction at subsection (b)(23) if the 
defendant took certain actions prior to 
the defendant’s knowledge of the 
criminal investigation or prosecution of 
the offense. The Commission seeks 
comment on whether this new 
adjustment should apply more narrowly 
or more broadly. The Commission also 
seeks comment on whether the criteria 
provided for this new reduction are 
appropriate. Should any criterion be 
deleted or changed? Should the 
Commission provide additional or 
different criteria? Should the proposed 
amendment instead replace the tiered 
approach with a multi-factor test? If so, 
what factors should be included for 
courts to consider when determining 
whether to provide an offense level 
reduction? 
The Commission is also considering a 
separate proposed amendment that 
would provide a reduction at newly 
created § 3E1.2 (Post-Offense 
Rehabilitation) based on a defendant’s 
positive post-offense behavior or 
rehabilitative efforts. The Commission 
seeks comment on how the proposed 
reduction at § 2B1.1(b)(23) under Part B 
of this proposed amendment should 
interact with the proposed reduction at 
§ 3E1.2 under the other amendment. 
Should the proposed reduction at 
§ 2B1.1(b)(23) be cumulative with a 
reduction at § 3E1.2 for post-offense 
rehabilitation, or should the 
Commission limit the cumulative 
reduction of these provisions? Are there 
other provisions in the Guidelines 
Manual that would interact with the proposed reduction at § 2B1.1(b)(23)? If 
so, how should the Commission account 
for the interaction(s)? 
5. Section 2B1.1 contains specific 
offense characteristics (SOCs) that are 
applied infrequently. The Commission 
seeks comment on whether it should 
simplify the guideline by amending or 
removing three infrequently applied 
SOCs: § 2B1.1(b)(3) (‘‘If the offense 
involved a theft from the person of 
another, increase by 2 levels’’), (b)(4) 
(‘‘If the offense involved receiving 
stolen property, and the defendant was 
a person in the business of receiving 
and selling stolen property, increase by 
2 levels’’), and (b)(13) (‘‘if the defendant 
was convicted under 42 U.S.C. 408(a), 
§ 1011(a), or § 1383a(a) and the statutory 
maximum term of ten years’ 
imprisonment applies, increase by 4 
levels. If the resulting offense level is 
less than 12, increase to level 12’’). If so, 
by what criteria should the Commission 
determine which SOCs to amend or 
remove? 
4. Post-Offense Rehabilitation 
Adjustment 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: In 
August 2025, the Commission identified 
as one of its policy priorities for the 
amendment cycle ending May 1, 2026, 
‘‘[e]xamination of whether the 
guidelines provide appropriate 
adjustments for good behavior . . . and 
possible consideration of amendments 
that might be appropriate.’’ U.S. Sent’g 
Comm’n, ‘‘Notice of Final Priorities,’’ 90 
FR 39263 (Aug. 14, 2025). 
The Commission has received 
comment suggesting that the guidelines 
do not sufficiently incentivize or reward 
positive post-offense conduct and 
rehabilitative efforts taken by 
defendants prior to sentencing. While 
§ 3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility) 
accounts for some types of positive post- 
offense conduct when the court 
considers a reduction for acceptance of 
responsibility, and § 5K1.1 (Substantial 
Assistance to Authorities) accounts for 
the defendant’s cooperation with 
authorities, commenters have 
recommended that the Commission 
consider positive post-offense conduct 
going beyond that covered by both 
guidelines. 
In response to these suggestions, the 
proposed amendment would add a new 
Chapter Three adjustment at § 3E1.2 
(Post-Offense Rehabilitation) providing 
a reduction if the defendant 
demonstrates positive post-offense 
behavior or rehabilitative efforts. The 
proposed amendment sets forth two 
options for the adjustment. 
Option 1 provides in subsection (a) 
for a reduction when the defendant 
demonstrates prior to sentencing 
positive post-offense behavior or 
rehabilitative efforts. Subsection (b) 
instructs the court that, in determining 
whether a defendant qualifies for the 
reduction, it shall consider the actions 
and efforts [voluntarily 
initiated][undertaken] by the defendant 
for the benefit of the defendant’s own 
rehabilitation, victim(s) of the offense, 
community, or other people. It then 
provides a non-exhaustive list of factors 
for the court to consider in making this 
determination. Subsection (c) provides 
for an additional reduction if the 
defendant qualifies for a decrease under 
subsection (a) and the positive post- 
offense behavior or rehabilitative efforts 
were undertaken before the criminal 
investigation or prosecution for the 
offense. 
Option 2 provides in subsection (a) 
for a reduction if the defendant 
demonstrates a sustained commitment 
to positive behavioral change evidenced 
by post-offense behavior or 
rehabilitative efforts that go beyond the 
typical actions undertaken by 
defendants prior to sentencing. 
Subsection (b) instructs the court that, 
in determining whether a defendant 
qualifies for the reduction, it shall 
consider the actions and efforts 
[voluntarily initiated][undertaken] by 
the defendant, and the timing of such 
actions and efforts, for the benefit of the 
defendant’s own rehabilitation, 
victim(s) of the offense, community, or 
other people. It then provides some 
broad examples of the types of efforts 
the court should consider for the 
adjustment, instead of a list of 
considerations like the one provided in 
Option 1. 
Issues for comment are also provided. 
Proposed Amendment: 
Chapter Three, Part E is amended— 
in the heading by striking 
‘‘ACCEPTANCE OF RESPONSIBILITY’’ 
and inserting ‘‘ACCEPTANCE OF 
RESPONSIBILITY AND POST- 
OFFENSE REHABILITATION’’; 
and by inserting at the end the 
following new guideline: 
Option 1 (Tiered Adjustments With 
Specific Considerations) 
‘‘§ 3E1.2. Post-Offense Rehabilitation (a) If the defendant demonstrates prior 
to sentencing positive post-offense 
behavior or rehabilitative efforts, 
decrease the offense level by [1][2][3] 
levels. 
(b) In determining whether a 
defendant qualifies for a reduction 
under subsection (a), the court shall 
consider the actions and efforts 
[voluntarily initiated][undertaken] by 
the defendant for the benefit of the 
defendant’s own rehabilitation, 
victim(s) of the offense, community, or 
other people. Appropriate 
considerations include the following: 
(1) The defendant took appropriate 
steps to reduce or remedy the harm 
caused by the offense. 
(2) The defendant made [voluntary] 
payment of restitution or [voluntarily] 
entered into an installment payment 
schedule for making restitution to any 
victims of the offense(s).

successfully participating in a 
[voluntary] court rehabilitation program. 
(4) The defendant completed or is 
successfully participating in a treatment 
program to address the abuse of drugs,

(5) The defendant completed or is 
successfully participating in counseling 
(e.g., mental health or anger management). 
(6) The defendant completed or is 
successfully participating in a General 
Education Development (or similar)

(7) The defendant maintained or 
obtained gainful employment. 
(8) The defendant provided [voluntary 
and] consistent financial support to 
family members or dependents. 
(9) The defendant performed 
volunteer or other civic, charitable, or 
public service in the community. 
(10) The defendant assisted in 
preventing another person from 
engaging in unlawful conduct. 
(11) The defendant assisted in 
promoting another person’s 
rehabilitation (e.g., identifying or getting into treatment a person addicted to or 
regularly abusing controlled 
substances). 
(c) If the defendant qualifies for a 
decrease under subsection (a) and the 
positive post-offense behavior or 
rehabilitative efforts were undertaken 
before the criminal investigation or 
prosecution for the offense, decrease the 
offense level by [1][2] additional 
[level][levels].’’. 
Option 2 (Adjustment Based on 
Standard With Examples) 
‘‘§ 3E1.2. Post-Offense Rehabilitation (a) If the defendant demonstrates a 
sustained commitment to positive 
behavioral change evidenced by post- 
offense behavior or rehabilitative efforts 
that go beyond the typical actions 
undertaken by defendants prior to 
sentencing, decrease the offense level by 
[1][2][3][4] levels. 
(b) In determining whether a 
defendant qualifies for a reduction 
under subsection (a), the court should 
consider the actions and efforts 
[voluntarily initiated][undertaken] by 
the defendant, and the timing of such 
actions and efforts, for the benefit of the 
defendant’s own rehabilitation, 
victim(s) of the offense, community, or 
other people. In making such 
determination, the court may consider 
any rehabilitative efforts undertaken by 
the defendant, including personal and 
behavioral changes of the defendant, 
steps taken to reduce or remedy the 
harm caused by the offense, substance 
abuse rehabilitation, employment 
history, academic and vocational 
achievements, role model behavior, and 
community and family involvement.’’. 
Issues for Comment 
1. The Commission has received 
comment suggesting that the guidelines 
do not sufficiently incentivize or reward 
positive post-offense conduct and 
rehabilitative efforts taken by 
defendants prior to sentencing. The 
Commission seeks comment on whether 
the proposed Chapter Three adjustment 
appropriately addresses these concerns. 
In determining whether to apply the 
proposed reduction, should the court 
consider a defendant’s successful 
compliance with their pre-trial 
conditions of release, if applicable, or 
institutional rules, if detained? For 
example, should defendants only be 
considered for the proposed reduction if 
they complied with all conditions of 
supervision prior to sentencing or all 
institutional rules if detained prior to 
sentencing? Are the considerations 
identified in Option 1 and the examples 
provided in Option 2 appropriate for 
courts to consider in determining 
whether a reduction under § 3E1.2 is 
warranted? Should the Commission 
provide additional or different 
considerations or examples? If so, what 
should the Commission provide? 
Should any consideration(s) or 
example(s) be excluded from 
consideration? If so, which ones? 
2. The Commission seeks comment on 
whether it should revise Option 2 of the 
proposed amendment to provide for a 
tiered reduction. For example, should 
Option 2 provide for a reduction based 
on a defendant’s successful compliance 
with their pre-trial conditions of release, 
if applicable, or institutional rules, if 
detained? Should Option 2 then provide 
for an additional reduction based on 
post-offense behavior or rehabilitative 
efforts undertaken by the defendant that 
go beyond the typical actions 
undertaken by defendants prior to 
sentencing? 
3. The Commission seeks comment on 
how the proposed reduction for post- 
offense rehabilitation should take into 
account the timing of the rehabilitative 
efforts undertaken by the defendant. 
When should such efforts occur to be 
considered under the proposed 
adjustment? Should such efforts be 
undertaken before the defendant is 
investigated or indicted? Should the 
court be allowed to consider efforts 
undertaken when the defendant is 
subject to an investigation by the 
authorities or is indicted for the offense? 
What changes should be made to the 
proposed amendment to address the 
timing of the defendant’s efforts? 
4. The proposed reduction accounts 
for rehabilitative efforts [voluntarily 
initiated] [undertaken] by the defendant. 
This bracketed ‘‘voluntariness’’ 
requirement could exclude 
rehabilitative efforts made pursuant to 
an order. Some defendants cannot afford 
to pay themselves for rehabilitation or 
treatment programs and may rely on 
court-funded programs to cover the 
costs of such programs. The 
Commission seeks comment on whether 
the proposed reduction should allow for 
the consideration of rehabilitative 
efforts made pursuant to an order. If so, 
what changes should be made to the 
proposed amendment to account for 
such efforts? 
5. The proposed amendment sets forth 
a reduction applicable to defendants 
who demonstrate positive post-offense 
behavior or rehabilitative efforts prior to 
sentencing. Other guidelines, most 
notably § 3E1.1 (Acceptance of 
Responsibility), also account for ‘‘post- 
offense rehabilitative efforts.’’ See 
§ 3E1.1, comment. (n.1(G)). Post-offense 
rehabilitative efforts may also include 
providing substantial assistance to the 
authorities in the investigation or 
prosecution of other individuals or 
offenses, which is accounted for under 
§ 5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to 
Authorities (Policy Statement)). 
The Commission seeks comment on 
how the proposed Chapter Three 
adjustment for post-offense 
rehabilitation should interact with other 
guidelines, especially § 3E1.1 and 
§ 5K1.1. Are there other guidelines that 
address similar concerns to those 
addressed by the proposed adjustment? 
What are those guidelines and how 
should the proposed adjustment interact 
with them? Should the Commission 
distinguish the types of rehabilitative 
efforts to be accounted for under the 
proposed adjustment from those that 
could be considered under other 
guidelines? For example, should the 
proposed adjustment account for efforts 
relating to the defendant’s own 
rehabilitation or for the benefit of the 
community or other people, while 
§ 3E1.1 accounts for rehabilitative 
efforts relating to the offense committed 
by the defendant? Should the 
Commission place a limitation on the 
extent of the reduction under the 
proposed adjustment if the defendant 
also received an adjustment under 
§ 3E1.1 and/or § 5K1.1? If so, what 
should the limit be? Are there any other 
guideline reductions that the 
Commission should consider for 
purposes of limiting the extent of the

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259683 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Notices reduction under the proposed 
adjustment? 
6. The Commission is considering a 
separate proposed amendment that 
would add to § 2B1.1 (Theft, Property 
Destruction, and Fraud) a new tiered 
reduction at subsection (b)(23) if the 
defendant took certain actions prior to 
the criminal investigation or 
prosecution for the offense. The 
Commission seeks comment on how the 
proposed Chapter Three adjustment for 
post-offense rehabilitation should 
interact with the proposed tiered 
reduction at § 2B1.1(b)(23) set forth in 
the proposed amendment on economic 
crimes. Should the proposed Chapter 
Three adjustment for post-offense 
rehabilitation be cumulative with the 
proposed tiered reduction at 
§ 2B1.1(b)(23), or should the 
Commission limit the cumulative 
reduction of these provisions? Are there 
other provisions in the Guidelines 
Manual that would interact with the proposed Chapter Three adjustment for 
post-offense rehabilitation? If so, how 
should the Commission account for the 
interaction(s)? 
5. Multiple Counts 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: In 
August 2025, the Commission identified 
as one of its policy priorities for the 
amendment cycle ending May 1, 2026, 
‘‘[c]ontinued exploration of ways to 
simplify the Guidelines Manual,’’ 
including ‘‘examining the operation of 
the grouping rules in Chapter Three, 
Part D (Multiple Counts).’’ U.S. Sent’g 
Comm’n, ‘‘Notice of Final Priorities,’’ 90 
FR 39263 (Aug. 14, 2025). 
The guidelines generally require a 
single, combined offense level in each 
case. Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple 
Counts) of the Guidelines Manual 
‘‘provides the rules for determining a 
single offense level that encompasses all 
the counts of which the defendant is 
convicted.’’ USSG Ch. 3, Pt. D, intro 
comment (Nov. 1, 2025). The rules in 
Part D apply to multiple counts 
regardless of whether they are contained 
in the same indictment or are contained 
in different indictments and sentences 
on those counts are to be imposed at the 
same time. These rules also apply to 
some single count cases that include 
additional conduct that is treated under 
the Guidelines Manual as if it were a separate count of conviction. See, e.g., 
USSG §§ 1B1.2(c) & (d); 2G1.1(d), 
2G1.3(d), 2G2.1(d). As provided in 
§ 3D1.1 (Procedure for Determining 
Offense Level on Multiple Counts), the 
multiple count rules proceed in three 
steps: (1) grouping the counts into 
distinct groups of closely related counts 
by applying the rules specified in 
§ 3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related 
Counts); (2) determining the offense 
level applicable to each group, as 
provided in § 3D1.3 (Offense Level 
Applicable to Each Group of Closely 
Related Counts); and (3) determining the 
combined offense level applicable to all 
groups using the unit system, as 
provided in § 3D1.4 (Determining the 
Combined Offense Level). 
The first step requires grouping 
counts ‘‘involving substantially the 
same harm.’’ Subsections (a) through (d) 
of § 3D1.2 set forth the four situations 
when multiple counts involve 
substantially the same harm: (a) when 
the counts involve the same victim and 
arise from a single criminal act or 
transaction; (b) when the counts involve 
the same victim and two or more 
distinct criminal transactions connected 
by a common criminal objective or 
constituting part of a common scheme 
or plan; (c) when one of the counts 
‘‘embodies conduct that is treated’’ as a 
specific offense characteristic or 
adjustment in the guideline applicable 
to another of the counts; and (d) when 
the counts involve offenses to which the 
same guideline or two different 
guidelines ‘‘of the same general type’’ 
apply and the offense level is 
determined largely based on cumulative 
measures (such as total amount of harm 
or loss, the quantity of a substance 
involved, or some other measure of 
aggregate harm) or the offense behavior 
is ongoing or continuous in nature. 
Section 3D1.2(d), which applies to the 
fourth situation described above, 
provides lists of both offenses that are 
covered by this rule and offenses that 
are excluded from application of this 
rule. The rules contained in § 3D1.2 aim 
to ensure that the guideline range 
reflects the overall harm and conduct 
without accounting for the same or 
similar conduct twice. More than one 
rule may provide a basis for grouping, 
but only one rule must apply for counts 
to group. 
The second step requires determining 
the offense level applicable to each 
group. This determination depends on 
which grouping rule applies. As 
provided in § 3D1.3(a), each count 
grouped under § 3D1.2(a)–(c) is 
calculated separately, and the offense 
level for the group will be the highest 
offense level of the counts in the group. 
Section 3D1.3(b) sets forth a different 
procedure for counts grouped under 
§ 3D1.2(d). If the counts involve offenses 
to which the same guideline applies, 
instead of calculating the offense level 
for each count and choosing the count 
resulting in the highest offense level, the 
guideline is applied one time using the 
aggregate harm or quantity of the 
grouped counts to determine the offense 
level. The resulting offense level will be 
applicable to the group of counts. 
However, if the counts involve offenses 
of the same general type to which 
different guidelines apply, each count is 
calculated separately, and the offense 
level for the group will be the highest 
offense level of the counts in the group. 
The third and final step set forth in 
§ 3D1.4 requires assigning units to 
determine the combined offense level. 
The group with the highest offense level 
is assigned one unit, and each 
remaining group is assigned either one, 
one-half, and no additional units. The 
number of additional units is based on 
the relationship between the group with 
the highest offense level and any 
remaining groups. One unit is assigned 
to any remaining group of comparable 
seriousness, that is, a group with the 
same offense level or with one to four 
fewer offense levels. One-half unit is 
assigned to any remaining group of 
somewhat comparable seriousness, that 
is, a group with five to eight fewer 
offense levels. No units are assigned to 
any remaining group of incomparable 
seriousness, that is, a group with nine 
or more fewer offense levels. The total 
number of units determines whether— 
and the extent to which—additional 
offense levels are assigned to the most 
serious group. 
The Commission is considering 
simplification of these multiple count 
rules for three reasons. First, some 
commenters have requested 
simplification of these rules because 
they are ‘‘confusing’’ and may lead to 
‘‘incorrect calculations.’’ Second, the 
Commission’s HelpLine responds to 
hundreds of calls each year from 
practitioners specifically seeking 
guidance on the application of the 
multiple count rules. Third, despite the 
expenditure of significant training 
resources, the Commission has 
continued to observe misapplication of 
the multiple count rules, resulting in 
unwarranted sentencing disparities. 
The proposed amendment would 
amend the guidelines to simplify the 
procedure for determining the single 
offense level for cases involving 
multiple counts. It would replace the 
five guidelines in Chapter Three, Part D 
with a single guideline at § 3D1.1 that 
provides all the steps necessary to 
determine the single offense level for 
multiple counts. The revised § 3D1.1 
would contain the following four 
subsections. 
New subsection (a) provides that, if 
multiple counts use the same guideline 
and the guideline is listed therein, the 
offense level for this group of counts is 
determined using the combined offense

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259684 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Notices behavior taken as a whole. The 
guidelines listed in new subsection (a) 
are the same guidelines that require 
aggregation under current § 3D1.2(d). As 
such, new subsection (a) maintains the 
current approach for aggregate harm 
offenses as set forth in current 
§ 3D1.3(b). 
New subsection (b) provides that, if 
multiple counts use the same guideline 
and the guideline is listed therein, the 
offense level for each count is calculated 
separately and an adjustment based on 
the number of counts applies to the 
count in this group resulting in the 
highest offense level. The guidelines 
listed in new subsection (b) are all 
guidelines that are not aggregated 
pursuant to current § 3D1.2(d) and cover 
offenses against a person, offenses that 
frequently result in a multiple count 
increase under the current § 3D1.4, and 
six guidelines that contain instructions 
providing for a multiple count 
adjustment under certain circumstances. 
New subsection (c) explains how to 
determine the offense level for all 
counts, including the group of counts 
covered by new subsections (a) and (b). 
It instructs to use the offense level from 
the count or group of counts (as 
determined under subsections (a) and 
(b)) resulting in the highest offense 
level. 
New subsection (d) retains the 
provisions of current § 3D1.1(b) 
identifying certain types of convictions 
that are excluded from the guideline 
rules applicable to multiple counts. 
The proposed amendment would also 
make conforming changes throughout 
the Guidelines Manual to reflect the new procedure of determining the 
offense level applicable to cases 
involving multiple counts, and the 
deletion of the current provisions of 
Chapter Three, Part D. 
Issues for comment are also provided. 
Proposed Amendment: 
Chapter Three, Part D is amended— 
by striking in their entirety the 
Introductory Commentary, §§ 3D1.1 
through 3D1.5, and the Concluding 
Commentary to Part D of Chapter Three 
as follows: 
‘‘Introductory Commentary 
This part provides rules for 
determining a single offense level that 
encompasses all the counts of which the 
defendant is convicted. These rules 
apply to multiple counts of conviction 
(A) contained in the same indictment or 
information; or (B) contained in 
different indictments or informations for 
which sentences are to be imposed at 
the same time or in a consolidated 
proceeding. The single, ‘combined’ 
offense level that results from applying 
these rules is used, after adjustment 
pursuant to the guidelines in 
subsequent parts, to determine the 
sentence. These rules have been 
designed primarily with the more 
commonly prosecuted federal offenses 
in mind. 
The rules in this part seek to provide 
incremental punishment for significant 
additional criminal conduct. The most 
serious offense is used as a starting 
point. The other counts determine how 
much to increase the offense level. The 
amount of the additional punishment 
declines as the number of additional 
offenses increases. 
Some offenses that may be charged in 
multiple-count indictments are so 
closely intertwined with other offenses 
that conviction for them ordinarily 
would not warrant increasing the 
guideline range. For example, 
embezzling money from a bank and 
falsifying the related records, although 
legally distinct offenses, represent 
essentially the same type of wrongful 
conduct with the same ultimate harm, 
so that it would be more appropriate to 
treat them as a single offense for 
purposes of sentencing. Other offenses, 
such as an assault causing bodily injury 
to a teller during a bank robbery, are so 
closely related to the more serious 
offense that it would be appropriate to 
treat them as part of the more serious 
offense, leaving the sentence 
enhancement to result from application 
of a specific offense characteristic. 
In order to limit the significance of 
the formal charging decision and to 
prevent multiple punishment for 
substantially identical offense conduct, 
this part provides rules for grouping 
offenses together. Convictions on 
multiple counts do not result in a 
sentence enhancement unless they 
represent additional conduct that is not 
otherwise accounted for by the 
guidelines. In essence, counts that are 
grouped together are treated as 
constituting a single offense for 
purposes of the guidelines. 
Some offense guidelines, such as 
those for theft, fraud and drug offenses, 
contain provisions that deal with 
repetitive or ongoing behavior. Other 
guidelines, such as those for assault and 
robbery, are oriented more toward single 
episodes of criminal behavior. 
Accordingly, different rules are required 
for dealing with multiple-count 
convictions involving these two 
different general classes of offenses. 
More complex cases involving different 
types of offenses may require 
application of one rule to some of the 
counts and another rule to other counts. 
Some offenses, e.g., racketeering and conspiracy, may be ‘composite’ in that 
they involve a pattern of conduct or 
scheme involving multiple underlying 
offenses. The rules in this part are to be 
used to determine the offense level for 
such composite offenses from the 
offense level for the underlying offenses. 
Essentially, the rules in this part can 
be summarized as follows: (1) If the 
offense guidelines in Chapter Two base 
the offense level primarily on the 
amount of money or quantity of 
substance involved (e.g., theft, fraud, drug trafficking, firearms dealing), or 
otherwise contain provisions dealing 
with repetitive or ongoing misconduct 
(e.g., many environmental offenses), add the numerical quantities and apply the 
pertinent offense guideline, including 
any specific offense characteristics for 
the conduct taken as a whole. (2) When 
offenses are closely interrelated, group 
them together for purposes of the 
multiple-count rules, and use only the 
offense level for the most serious offense 
in that group. (3) As to other offenses 
(e.g., independent instances of assault or robbery), start with the offense level for 
the most serious count and use the 
number and severity of additional 
counts to determine the amount by 
which to increase that offense level. 
§ 3D1.1. Procedure for Determining Offense Level on Multiple Counts 
(a) When a defendant has been 
convicted of more than one count, the 
court shall: 
(1) Group the counts resulting in 
conviction into distinct Groups of 
Closely Related Counts (‘Groups’) by 
applying the rules specified in § 3D1.2. 
(2) Determine the offense level 
applicable to each Group by applying 
the rules specified in § 3D1.3. 
(3) Determine the combined offense 
level applicable to all Groups taken 
together by applying the rules specified 
in § 3D1.4. 
(b) Exclude from the application of 
§§ 3D1.2–3D1.5 the following: 
(1) Any count for which the statute 
(A) specifies a term of imprisonment to 
be imposed; and (B) requires that such 
term of imprisonment be imposed to run 
consecutively to any other term of 
imprisonment. Sentences for such 
counts are governed by the provisions of 
§ 5G1.2(a). 
(2) Any count of conviction under 18 
U.S.C. 1028A. See Application Note 2(B) of the Commentary to § 5G1.2 
(Sentencing on Multiple Counts of 
Conviction) for guidance on how 
sentences for multiple counts of 
conviction under 18 U.S.C. 1028A 
should be imposed.

in the same indictment or information; 
or (B) contained in different indictments 
or informations for which sentences are 
to be imposed at the same time or in a 
consolidated proceeding. 
2. Application of Subsection (b).— Subsection (b)(1) applies if a statute (A) 
specifies a term of imprisonment to be 
imposed; and (B) requires that such 
term of imprisonment be imposed to run 
consecutively to any other term of 
imprisonment. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 924(c) (requiring mandatory minimum 
terms of imprisonment, based on the 
conduct involved, to run consecutively). 
The multiple count rules set out under 
this part do not apply to a count of 
conviction covered by subsection (b). 
However, a count covered by subsection 
(b)(1) may affect the offense level 
determination for other counts. For 
example, a defendant is convicted of 
one count of bank robbery (18 U.S.C. 
2113), and one count of use of a firearm 
in the commission of a crime of violence 
(18 U.S.C. 924(c)). The two counts are 
not grouped together pursuant to this 
guideline, and, to avoid unwarranted 
double counting, the offense level for 
the bank robbery count under § 2B3.1 
(Robbery) is computed without 
application of the enhancement for 
weapon possession or use as otherwise 
required by subsection (b)(2) of that 
guideline. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 924(c), 
the mandatory minimum five-year 
sentence on the weapon-use count runs 
consecutively to the guideline sentence 
imposed on the bank robbery count. See 
§ 5G1.2(a). 
Unless specifically instructed, 
subsection (b)(1) does not apply when 
imposing a sentence under a statute that 
requires the imposition of a consecutive 
term of imprisonment only if a term of 
imprisonment is imposed (i.e., the statute does not otherwise require a 
term of imprisonment to be imposed). 
See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 3146 (Penalty for 
failure to appear); 18 U.S.C. 924(a)(4) 
(regarding penalty for 18 U.S.C. 922(q) 
(possession or discharge of a firearm in 
a school zone)); 18 U.S.C. 1791(c) 
(penalty for providing or possessing a 
controlled substance in prison). 
Accordingly, the multiple count rules 
set out under this part do apply to a 
count of conviction under this type of 
statute. 
Background: This section outlines the procedure to be used for determining 
the combined offense level. After any 
adjustments from Chapter Three, Parts E 
(Acceptance of Responsibility) and F 
(Early Disposition Programs), and 
Chapter Four, Parts B (Career Offenders 
and Criminal Livelihood) and C 
(Adjustment for Certain Zero-Point 
Offenders) are made, this combined 
offense level is used to determine the 
guideline sentence range. Chapter Five 
(Determining the Sentencing Range and 
Options Under the Guidelines) 
discusses how to determine the 
sentence from the (combined) offense 
level; § 5G1.2 deals specifically with 
determining the sentence of 
imprisonment when convictions on 
multiple counts are involved. 
References in Chapter Five (Determining 
the Sentencing Range and Options 
Under the Guidelines) to the ‘offense 
level’ should be treated as referring to 
the combined offense level after all 
subsequent adjustments have been 
made. 
§ 3D1.2. Groups of Closely Related Counts 
All counts involving substantially the 
same harm shall be grouped together 
into a single Group. Counts involve 
substantially the same harm within the 
meaning of this rule: 
(a) When counts involve the same 
victim and the same act or transaction. 
(b) When counts involve the same 
victim and two or more acts or 
transactions connected by a common 
criminal objective or constituting part of 
a common scheme or plan. 
(c) When one of the counts embodies 
conduct that is treated as a specific 
offense characteristic in, or other 
adjustment to, the guideline applicable 
to another of the counts. 
(d) When the offense level is 
determined largely on the basis of the 
total amount of harm or loss, the 
quantity of a substance involved, or 
some other measure of aggregate harm, 
or if the offense behavior is ongoing or 
continuous in nature and the offense 
guideline is written to cover such 
behavior. 
Offenses covered by the following 
guidelines are to be grouped under this 
subsection: 
§ 2A3.5; 
§§ 2B1.1, 2B1.4, 2B1.5, 2B4.1, 2B5.1, 
2B5.3, 2B6.1; 
§§ 2C1.1, 2C1.2, 2C1.8; 
§§ 2D1.1, 2D1.2, 2D1.5, 2D1.11, 
2D1.13; 
§§ 2E4.1, 2E5.1; 
§§ 2G2.2, 2G3.1; 
§ 2K2.1; 
§§ 2L1.1, 2L2.1; 
§ 2N3.1; 
§ 2Q2.1; 
§ 2R1.1; 
§§ 2S1.1, 2S1.3; 
§§ 2T1.1, 2T1.4, 2T1.6, 2T1.7, 2T1.9, 
2T2.1, 2T3.1. 
Specifically excluded from the 
operation of this subsection are: 
all offenses in Chapter Two, Part A 
(except § 2A3.5); 
§§ 2B2.1, 2B2.3, 2B3.1, 2B3.2, 2B3.3; 
§ 2C1.5; 
§§ 2D2.1, 2D2.2, 2D2.3; 
§§ 2E1.3, 2E1.4, 2E2.1; 
§§ 2G1.1, 2G1.3, 2G2.1; 
§§ 2H1.1, 2H2.1, 2H4.1; 
§§ 2L2.2, 2L2.5; 
§§ 2M2.1, 2M2.3, 2M3.1, 2M3.2, 
2M3.3, 2M3.4, 2M3.5, 2M3.9; 
§§ 2P1.1, 2P1.2, 2P1.3; 
§ 2X6.1. 
For multiple counts of offenses that 
are not listed, grouping under this 
subsection may or may not be 
appropriate; a case-by-case 
determination must be made based 
upon the facts of the case and the 
applicable guidelines (including 
specific offense characteristics and other 
adjustments) used to determine the 
offense level. 
Exclusion of an offense from grouping 
under this subsection does not 
necessarily preclude grouping under 
another subsection.

Application Notes: 
1. Subsections (a)–(d) set forth 
circumstances in which counts are to be 
grouped together into a single Group. 
Counts are to be grouped together into 
a single Group if any one or more of the 
subsections provide for such grouping. 
Counts for which the statute (A) 
specifies a term of imprisonment to be 
imposed; and (B) requires that such 
term of imprisonment be imposed to run 
consecutively to any other term of 
imprisonment are excepted from 
application of the multiple count rules. 
See § 3D1.1(b)(1); id., comment. (n.1). 2. The term ‘victim’ is not intended to 
include indirect or secondary victims. 
Generally, there will be one person who 
is directly and most seriously affected 
by the offense and is therefore 
identifiable as the victim. For offenses 
in which there are no identifiable 
victims (e.g., drug or immigration offenses, where society at large is the 
victim), the ‘victim’ for purposes of 
subsections (a) and (b) is the societal 
interest that is harmed. In such cases, 
the counts are grouped together when 
the societal interests that are harmed are 
closely related. Where one count, for 
example, involves unlawfully entering 
the United States and the other involves 
possession of fraudulent evidence of 
citizenship, the counts are grouped 
together because the societal interests 
harmed (the interests protected by laws 
governing immigration) are closely 
related. In contrast, where one count 
involves the sale of controlled 
substances and the other involves an 
immigration law violation, the counts 
are not grouped together because

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259686 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Notices different societal interests are harmed. 
Ambiguities should be resolved in 
accordance with the purpose of this 
section as stated in the lead paragraph, 
i.e., to identify and group ‘counts involving substantially the same harm.’ 
3. Under subsection (a), counts are to 
be grouped together when they 
represent essentially a single injury or 
are part of a single criminal episode or 
transaction involving the same victim. 
When one count charges an attempt to 
commit an offense and the other charges 
the commission of that offense, or when 
one count charges an offense based on 
a general prohibition and the other 
charges violation of a specific 
prohibition encompassed in the general 
prohibition, the counts will be grouped 
together under subsection (a). 
Examples: (1) The defendant is convicted of forging and uttering the 
same check. The counts are to be 
grouped together. (2) The defendant is 
convicted of kidnapping and assaulting 
the victim during the course of the 
kidnapping. The counts are to be 
grouped together. (3) The defendant is 
convicted of bid rigging (an antitrust 
offense) and of mail fraud for signing 
and mailing a false statement that the 
bid was competitive. The counts are to 
be grouped together. (4) The defendant 
is convicted of two counts of assault on 
a federal officer for shooting at the same 
officer twice while attempting to 
prevent apprehension as part of a single 
criminal episode. The counts are to be 
grouped together. (5) The defendant is 
convicted of three counts of unlawfully 
bringing aliens into the United States, 
all counts arising out of a single 
incident. The three counts are to be 
grouped together. But: (6) The defendant is convicted of two counts of assault on 
a federal officer for shooting at the 
officer on two separate days. The counts 
are not to be grouped together. 
4. Subsection (b) provides that counts 
that are part of a single course of 
conduct with a single criminal objective 
and represent essentially one composite 
harm to the same victim are to be 
grouped together, even if they constitute 
legally distinct offenses occurring at 
different times. This provision does not 
authorize the grouping of offenses that 
cannot be considered to represent 
essentially one composite harm (e.g., 
robbery of the same victim on different 
occasions involves multiple, separate 
instances of fear and risk of harm, not 
one composite harm). 
When one count charges a conspiracy 
or solicitation and the other charges a 
substantive offense that was the sole 
object of the conspiracy or solicitation, 
the counts will be grouped together 
under subsection (b). 
Examples: (1) The defendant is convicted of one count of conspiracy to 
commit extortion and one count of 
extortion for the offense he conspired to 
commit. The counts are to be grouped 
together. (2) The defendant is convicted 
of two counts of mail fraud and one 
count of wire fraud, each in furtherance 
of a single fraudulent scheme. The 
counts are to be grouped together, even 
if the mailings and telephone call 
occurred on different days. (3) The 
defendant is convicted of one count of 
auto theft and one count of altering the 
vehicle identification number of the car 
he stole. The counts are to be grouped 
together. (4) The defendant is convicted 
of two counts of distributing a 
controlled substance, each count 
involving a separate sale of 10 grams of 
cocaine that is part of a common scheme 
or plan. In addition, a finding is made 
that there are two other sales, also part 
of the common scheme or plan, each 
involving 10 grams of cocaine. The total 
amount of all four sales (40 grams of 
cocaine) will be used to determine the 
offense level for each count under 
§ 1B1.3(a)(2). The two counts will then 
be grouped together under either this 
subsection or subsection (d) to avoid 
double counting. But: (5) The defendant is convicted of two counts of rape for 
raping the same person on different 
days. The counts are not to be grouped 
together. 
5. Subsection (c) provides that when 
conduct that represents a separate 
count, e.g., bodily injury or obstruction of justice, is also a specific offense 
characteristic in or other adjustment to 
another count, the count represented by 
that conduct is to be grouped with the 
count to which it constitutes an 
aggravating factor. This provision 
prevents ‘double counting’ of offense 
behavior. Of course, this rule applies 
only if the offenses are closely related. 
It is not, for example, the intent of this 
rule that (assuming they could be joined 
together) a bank robbery on one 
occasion and an assault resulting in 
bodily injury on another occasion be 
grouped together. The bodily injury (the 
harm from the assault) would not be a 
specific offense characteristic to the 
robbery and would represent a different 
harm. On the other hand, use of a 
firearm in a bank robbery and unlawful 
possession of that firearm are 
sufficiently related to warrant grouping 
of counts under this subsection. 
Frequently, this provision will overlap 
subsection (a), at least with respect to 
specific offense characteristics. 
However, a count such as obstruction of 
justice, which represents a Chapter 
Three adjustment and involves a 
different harm or societal interest than 
the underlying offense, is covered by 
subsection (c) even though it is not 
covered by subsection (a). 
Sometimes there may be several 
counts, each of which could be treated 
as an aggravating factor to another more 
serious count, but the guideline for the 
more serious count provides an 
adjustment for only one occurrence of 
that factor. In such cases, only the count 
representing the most serious of those 
factors is to be grouped with the other 
count. For example, if in a robbery of a 
credit union on a military base the 
defendant is also convicted of assaulting 
two employees, one of whom is injured 
seriously, the assault with serious 
bodily injury would be grouped with 
the robbery count, while the remaining 
assault conviction would be treated 
separately. 
A cross reference to another offense 
guideline does not constitute ‘a specific 
offense characteristic . . . or other 
adjustment’ within the meaning of 
subsection (c). For example, the 
guideline for bribery of a public official 
contains a cross reference to the 
guideline for a conspiracy to commit the 
offense that the bribe was to facilitate. 
Nonetheless, if the defendant were 
convicted of one count of securities 
fraud and one count of bribing a public 
official to facilitate the fraud, the two 
counts would not be grouped together 
by virtue of the cross reference. If, 
however, the bribe was given for the 
purpose of hampering a criminal 
investigation into the offense, it would 
constitute obstruction and under § 3C1.1 
would result in a 2-level enhancement 
to the offense level for the fraud. Under 
the latter circumstances, the counts 
would be grouped together. 
6. Subsection (d) likely will be used 
with the greatest frequency. It provides 
that most property crimes (except 
robbery, burglary, extortion and the 
like), drug offenses, firearms offenses, 
and other crimes where the guidelines 
are based primarily on quantity or 
contemplate continuing behavior are to 
be grouped together. The list of 
instances in which this subsection 
should be applied is not exhaustive. 
Note, however, that certain guidelines 
are specifically excluded from the 
operation of subsection (d). 
A conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation 
to commit an offense is covered under 
subsection (d) if the offense that is the 
object of the conspiracy, attempt, or 
solicitation is covered under subsection 
(d). 
Counts involving offenses to which 
different offense guidelines apply are 
grouped together under subsection (d) if 
the offenses are of the same general type

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259687 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Notices and otherwise meet the criteria for 
grouping under this subsection. In such 
cases, the offense guideline that results 
in the highest offense level is used; see 
§ 3D1.3(b). The ‘same general type’ of 
offense is to be construed broadly. 
Examples: (1) The defendant is convicted of five counts of embezzling 
money from a bank. The five counts are 
to be grouped together. (2) The 
defendant is convicted of two counts of 
theft of social security checks and three 
counts of theft from the mail, each from 
a different victim. All five counts are to 
be grouped together. (3) The defendant 
is convicted of five counts of mail fraud 
and ten counts of wire fraud. Although 
the counts arise from various schemes, 
each involves a monetary objective. All 
fifteen counts are to be grouped 
together. (4) The defendant is convicted 
of three counts of unlicensed dealing in 
firearms. All three counts are to be 
grouped together. (5) The defendant is 
convicted of one count of selling heroin, 
one count of selling PCP, and one count 
of selling cocaine. The counts are to be 
grouped together. The Commentary to 
§ 2D1.1 provides rules for combining 
(adding) quantities of different drugs to 
determine a single combined offense 
level. (6) The defendant is convicted of 
three counts of tax evasion. The counts 
are to be grouped together. (7) The 
defendant is convicted of three counts 
of discharging toxic substances from a 
single facility. The counts are to be 
grouped together. (8) The defendant is 
convicted on two counts of check 
forgery and one count of uttering the 
first of the forged checks. All three 
counts are to be grouped together. Note, 
however, that the uttering count is first 
grouped with the first forgery count 
under subsection (a) of this guideline, so 
that the monetary amount of that check 
counts only once when the rule in 
§ 3D1.3(b) is applied. But: (9) The defendant is convicted of three counts 
of bank robbery. The counts are not to 
be grouped together, nor are the 
amounts of money involved to be 
added. 
7. A single case may result in 
application of several of the rules in this 
section. Thus, for example, example (8) 
in the discussion of subsection (d) 
involves an application of § 3D1.2(a) 
followed by an application of 
§ 3D1.2(d). Note also that a Group may 
consist of a single count; conversely, all 
counts may form a single Group. 
8. A defendant may be convicted of 
conspiring to commit several 
substantive offenses and also of 
committing one or more of the 
substantive offenses. In such cases, treat 
the conspiracy count as if it were 
several counts, each charging 
conspiracy to commit one of the 
substantive offenses. See § 1B1.2(d) and accompanying commentary. Then apply 
the ordinary grouping rules to 
determine the combined offense level 
based upon the substantive counts of 
which the defendant is convicted and 
the various acts cited by the conspiracy 
count that would constitute behavior of 
a substantive nature. Example: The defendant is convicted of two counts: 
conspiring to commit offenses A, B, and 
C, and committing offense A. Treat this 
as if the defendant was convicted of (1) 
committing offense A; (2) conspiracy to 
commit offense A; (3) conspiracy to 
commit offense B; and (4) conspiracy to 
commit offense C. Count (1) and count 
(2) are grouped together under 
§ 3D1.2(b). Group the remaining counts, 
including the various acts cited by the 
conspiracy count that would constitute 
behavior of a substantive nature, 
according to the rules in this section. 
Background: Ordinarily, the first step in determining the combined offense 
level in a case involving multiple counts 
is to identify those counts that are 
sufficiently related to be placed in the 
same Group of Closely Related Counts 
(‘Group’). This section specifies four 
situations in which counts are to be 
grouped together. Although it appears 
last for conceptual reasons, subsection 
(d) probably will be used most 
frequently. 
A primary consideration in this 
section is whether the offenses involve 
different victims. For example, a 
defendant may stab three prison guards 
in a single escape attempt. Some would 
argue that all counts arising out of a 
single transaction or occurrence should 
be grouped together even when there are 
distinct victims. Although such a 
proposal was considered, it was rejected 
because, in many cases, it would not 
adequately capture the scope and 
impact of the criminal behavior. Cases 
involving injury to distinct victims are 
sufficiently comparable, whether or not 
the injuries are inflicted in distinct 
transactions, so that each such count 
should be treated separately rather than 
grouped together. Counts involving 
different victims (or societal harms in 
the case of ‘victimless’ crimes) are 
grouped together only as provided in 
subsection (c) or (d). 
Even if counts involve a single victim, 
the decision as to whether to group 
them together may not always be clear 
cut. For example, how 
contemporaneous must two assaults on 
the same victim be in order to warrant 
grouping together as constituting a 
single transaction or occurrence? 
Existing case law may provide some 
guidance as to what constitutes distinct 
offenses, but such decisions often turn 
on the technical language of the statute 
and cannot be controlling. In 
interpreting this part and resolving 
ambiguities, the court should look to the 
underlying policy of this part as stated 
in the Introductory Commentary. 
§ 3D1.3. Offense Level Applicable to Each Group of Closely Related Counts 
Determine the offense level applicable 
to each of the Groups as follows: 
(a) In the case of counts grouped 
together pursuant to § 3D1.2(a)–(c), the 
offense level applicable to a Group is 
the offense level, determined in 
accordance with Chapter Two and Parts 
A, B, and C of Chapter Three, for the 
most serious of the counts comprising 
the Group, i.e., the highest offense level of the counts in the Group. 
(b) In the case of counts grouped 
together pursuant to § 3D1.2(d), the 
offense level applicable to a Group is 
the offense level corresponding to the 
aggregated quantity, determined in 
accordance with Chapter Two and Parts 
A, B and C of Chapter Three. When the 
counts involve offenses of the same 
general type to which different 
guidelines apply, apply the offense 
guideline that produces the highest 
offense level. 
Commentary 
Application Notes: 
1. The ‘offense level’ for a count refers 
to the offense level from Chapter Two 
after all adjustments from Parts A, B, 
and C of Chapter Three. 
2. When counts are grouped pursuant 
to § 3D1.2(a)–(c), the highest offense 
level of the counts in the group is used. 
Ordinarily, it is necessary to determine 
the offense level for each of the counts 
in a Group in order to ensure that the 
highest is correctly identified. 
Sometimes, it will be clear that one 
count in the Group cannot have a higher 
offense level than another, as with a 
count for an attempt or conspiracy to 
commit the completed offense. The 
formal determination of the offense 
level for such a count may be 
unnecessary. 
3. When counts are grouped pursuant 
to § 3D1.2(d), the offense guideline 
applicable to the aggregate behavior is 
used. If the counts in the Group are 
covered by different guidelines, use the 
guideline that produces the highest 
offense level. Determine whether the 
specific offense characteristics or 
adjustments from Chapter Three, Parts 
A, B, and C apply based upon the 
combined offense behavior taken as a 
whole. Note that guidelines for similar 
property offenses have been coordinated 
to produce identical offense levels, at 
least when substantial property losses

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259688 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Notices are involved. However, when small 
sums are involved the differing specific 
offense characteristics that require 
increasing the offense level to a certain 
minimum may affect the outcome. 
Background: This section provides rules for determining the offense level 
associated with each Group of Closely 
Related Counts. Summary examples of 
the application of these rules are 
provided at the end of the Commentary 
to this part. 
§ 3D1.4. Determining the Combined Offense Level 
The combined offense level is 
determined by taking the offense level 
applicable to the Group with the highest 
offense level and increasing that offense 
level by the amount indicated in the 
following table: 
Number of units Increase in offense 
level 
1 ................................ none. 
1
1
2............................. add 1 level. 
2 ................................ add 2 levels. 
2
1
2–3 ......................... add 3 levels. 
3
1
2–5 ......................... add 4 levels. 
More than 5 ............... add 5 levels. 
In determining the number of Units 
for purposes of this section: 
(a) Count as one Unit the Group with 
the highest offense level. Count one 
additional Unit for each Group that is 
equally serious or from 1 to 4 levels less 
serious. 
(b) Count as one-half Unit any Group 
that is 5 to 8 levels less serious than the 
Group with the highest offense level. 
(c) Disregard any Group that is 9 or 
more levels less serious than the Group 
with the highest offense level. Such 
Groups will not increase the applicable 
offense level but may provide a reason 
for sentencing at the higher end of the 
sentencing range for the applicable 
offense level. 
Commentary 
Application Notes: 
1. Application of the rules in §§ 3D1.2 
and 3D1.3 may produce a single Group 
of Closely Related Counts. In such cases, 
the combined offense level is the level 
corresponding to the Group determined 
in accordance with § 3D1.3. 
2. The procedure for calculating the 
combined offense level when there is 
more than one Group of Closely Related 
Counts is as follows: First, identify the 
offense level applicable to the most 
serious Group; assign it one Unit. Next, 
determine the number of Units that the 
remaining Groups represent. Finally, 
increase the offense level for the most 
serious Group by the number of levels 
indicated in the table corresponding to 
the total number of Units. 
Background: When Groups are of roughly comparable seriousness, each 
Group will represent one Unit. When 
the most serious Group carries an 
offense level substantially higher than 
that applicable to the other Groups, 
however, counting the lesser Groups 
fully for purposes of the table could add 
excessive punishment, possibly even 
more than those offenses would carry if 
prosecuted separately. To avoid this 
anomalous result and produce declining 
marginal punishment, Groups 9 or more 
levels less serious than the most serious 
Group should not be counted for 
purposes of the table, and that Groups 
5 to 8 levels less serious should be 
treated as equal to one-half of a Group. 
Thus, if the most serious Group is at 
offense level 15 and if two other Groups 
are at level 10, there would be a total of 
two Units for purposes of the table (one 
plus one-half plus one-half) and the 
combined offense level would be 17. 
§ 3D1.5. Determining the Total Punishment 
Use the combined offense level to 
determine the appropriate sentence in 
accordance with the provisions of 
Chapter Five. 
Commentary 
This section refers the court to 
Chapter Five (Determining the 
Sentencing Range and Options Under 
the Guidelines) in order to determine 
the total punishment to be imposed 
based upon the combined offense level. 
The combined offense level is subject to 
adjustments from Chapter Three, Parts E 
(Acceptance of Responsibility) and F 
(Early Disposition Programs), and 
Chapter Four, Parts B (Career Offenders 
and Criminal Livelihood) and C 
(Adjustment for Certain Zero-Point 
Offenders).

Concluding Commentary to Part D of 
Chapter Three 
Illustrations of the Operation of the 
Multiple-Count Rules 
The following examples, drawn from 
presentence reports in the Commission’s 
files, illustrate the operation of the 
guidelines for multiple counts. The 
examples are discussed summarily; a 
more thorough, step-by-step approach is 
recommended until the user is 
thoroughly familiar with the guidelines. 
1. Defendant A was convicted of four 
counts, each charging robbery of a 
different bank. Each would represent a 
distinct Group. § 3D1.2. In each of the 
first three robberies, the offense level 
was 22 (20 plus a 2-level increase 
because a financial institution was 
robbed) (§ 2B3.1(b)). In the fourth 
robbery $21,000 was taken and a firearm 
was displayed; the offense level was 
therefore 28. As the first three counts 
are 6 levels lower than the fourth, each 
of the first three represents one-half unit 
for purposes of § 3D1.4. Altogether there 
are 2 
1
2Units, and the offense level for 
the most serious (28) is therefore 
increased by 3 levels under the table. 
The combined offense level is 31. 
2. Defendant B was convicted of four 
counts: (1) distribution of 230 grams of 
cocaine; (2) distribution of 150 grams of 
cocaine; (3) distribution of 75 grams of 
heroin; (4) offering a DEA agent $20,000 
to avoid prosecution. The combined 
offense level for drug offenses is 
determined by the total quantity of 
drugs, converted to converted drug 
weight (using the Drug Conversion 
Tables in the Commentary to § 2D1.1 
(Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, 
Exporting, or Trafficking)). The first 
count translates into 46 kilograms of 
converted drug weight; the second 
count translates into 30 kilograms of 
converted drug weight; and the third 
count translates into 75 kilograms of 
converted drug weight. The total is 151 
kilograms of converted drug weight. 
Under § 2D1.1, the combined offense 
level for the drug offenses is 24. In 
addition, because of the attempted bribe 
of the DEA agent, this offense level is 
increased by 2 levels to 26 under 
§ 3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the 
Administration of Justice). Because the 
conduct constituting the bribery offense 
is accounted for by § 3C1.1, it becomes 
part of the same Group as the drug 
offenses pursuant to § 3D1.2(c). The 
combined offense level is 26 pursuant to 
§ 3D1.3(a), because the offense level for 
bribery (20) is less than the offense level 
for the drug offenses (26). 
3. Defendant C was convicted of four 
counts arising out of a scheme pursuant 
to which the defendant received 
kickbacks from subcontractors. The 
counts were as follows: (1) The 
defendant received $1,000 from 
subcontractor A relating to contract X 
(Mail Fraud). (2) The defendant received 
$1,000 from subcontractor A relating to 
contract X (Commercial Bribery). (3) 
The defendant received $1,000 from 
subcontractor A relating to contract Y 
(Mail Fraud). (4) The defendant received 
$1,000 from subcontractor B relating to 
contract Z (Commercial Bribery). The 
mail fraud counts are covered by § 2B1.1 
(Theft, Property Destruction, and 
Fraud). The bribery counts are covered 
by § 2B4.1 (Bribery in Procurement of 
Bank Loan and Other Commercial 
Bribery), which treats the offense as a 
sophisticated fraud. The total money 
involved is $4,000, which results in an 
offense level of 9 under either § 2B1.1

and inserting the following new 
§ 3D1.1: 
§ 3D1.1. Procedure for Determining Offense Level on Multiple Counts 
(a) If there are multiple counts to 
which the same guideline applies and 
the guideline is listed below, determine 
the offense level applicable to these 
counts using the combined offense 
behavior taken as a whole. 
The guidelines covered by subsection 
(a) are as follows: 
§ 2A3.5; 
§§ 2B1.1, 2B1.4, 2B1.5, 2B4.1, 2B5.1, 
2B5.3, 2B6.1;

(b) (1) If there are multiple counts to 
which the same guideline applies and 
the guideline is listed below, determine 
the offense level applicable to these 
counts by calculating the offense level 
for each count separately and applying 
the adjustment set forth in subsection 
(b)(2) to the count resulting in the 
highest offense level. 
The guidelines covered by subsection 
(b) are as follows: 
all offenses in Chapter Two, Part A 
(except § 2A3.5); 
§§ 2B2.1, 2B3.1, 2B3.2, 2B3.3; 
§ 2D2.3;

§ 2K1.4; 
§ 2M6.1; 
§ 2N1.1; 
§ 2Q1.4; 
§ 2X6.1. 
(2) The adjustment set forth in the 
table below shall be based on the 
number of counts covered by the 
guidelines listed in paragraph (1). 
Number of counts 
covered by guideline 
listed in paragraph (1) 
Increase in offense

(B) 3 .......................... add [3] levels 
(C) 4 or 5 .................. add [4] levels 
(D) 6 or more ............ add [5] levels. 
(c) Determine the offense level for any 
remaining counts by calculating the 
offense level for each count separately. 
The offense level applicable to all 
counts of conviction is either the offense 
level from the count or the single 
offense level determined under 
subsections (a) and (b) for the counts 
resulting in the highest offense level. 
(d) Special Instruction for Certain Multiple Counts.—If there are multiple 
counts of conviction, exclude from the 
application of subsections (a) through 
(c) above the following counts: 
(1) Any count for which the statute 
(A) specifies a term of imprisonment to 
be imposed; and (B) requires that such 
term of imprisonment be imposed to run 
consecutively to any other term of 
imprisonment. Sentences for such 
counts are governed by subsection (a) of 
§ 5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts 
of Conviction). 
(2) Any count of conviction under 18 
U.S.C. 1028A. See Application Note 2(B) of the Commentary to § 5G1.2 
(Sentencing on Multiple Counts of 
Conviction) for guidance on how 
sentences for multiple counts of 
conviction under 18 U.S.C. 1028A 
should be imposed. 
Commentary 
Application Notes: 
1. In General.—This guideline provides rules for determining a single 
offense level that encompasses all the 
counts of which the defendant is 
convicted. For purposes of sentencing 
multiple counts of conviction, counts 
can be (A) contained in the same 
indictment or information; or (B) 
contained in different indictments or 
informations for which sentences are to 
be imposed at the same time or in a 
consolidated proceeding. 
2. Application of Subsection (d).— Subsection (d)(1) applies if a statute (A) 
specifies a term of imprisonment to be 
imposed; and (B) requires that such 
term of imprisonment be imposed to run 
consecutively to any other term of 
imprisonment. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 924(c) (requiring mandatory minimum 
terms of imprisonment, based on the 
conduct involved, to run consecutively). 
The multiple count rules set out under 
this guideline do not apply to a count 
of conviction covered by subsection (d). 
However, a count covered by subsection 
(d)(1) may affect the offense level 
determination for other counts. For 
example, a defendant is convicted of 
one count of bank robbery (18 U.S.C. 
2113), and one count of use of a firearm 
in the commission of a crime of violence 
(18 U.S.C. 924(c)). The two counts are 
not grouped together pursuant to this 
guideline, and, to avoid unwarranted 
double counting, the offense level for 
the bank robbery count under § 2B3.1 
(Robbery) is computed without 
application of the enhancement for 
weapon possession or use as otherwise 
required by subsection (b)(2) of that 
guideline. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 924(c), 
the mandatory minimum five-year 
sentence on the weapon-use count runs 
consecutively to the guideline sentence 
imposed on the bank robbery count. See 
§ 5G1.2(a). 
Unless specifically instructed, 
subsection (d)(1) does not apply when 
imposing a sentence under a statute that 
requires the imposition of a consecutive 
term of imprisonment only if a term of 
imprisonment is imposed (i.e., the statute does not otherwise require a 
term of imprisonment to be imposed). 
See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 3146 (Penalty for 
failure to appear); 18 U.S.C. 924(a)(4) 
(regarding penalty for 18 U.S.C. 922(q) 
(possession or discharge of a firearm in 
a school zone)); 18 U.S.C. 1791(c) 
(penalty for providing or possessing a 
controlled substance in prison). 
Accordingly, the multiple count rules 
set out under this part do apply to a 
count of conviction under this type of 
statute. 
Background: This section outlines the procedure to be used for determining 
the combined offense level. After any 
adjustments from Chapter Three, Parts E 
(Acceptance of Responsibility) and F 
(Early Disposition Programs), and 
Chapter Four, Parts B (Career Offenders 
and Criminal Livelihood) and C 
(Adjustment for Certain Zero-Point 
Offenders) are made, this combined 
offense level is used to determine the 
guideline sentence range. Chapter Five 
(Determining the Sentencing Range and 
Options Under the Guidelines) 
discusses how to determine the 
sentence from the (combined) offense 
level; § 5G1.2 deals specifically with 
determining the sentence of 
imprisonment when convictions on 
multiple counts are involved. 
References in Chapter Five (Determining 
the Sentencing Range and Options 
Under the Guidelines) to the ‘offense 
level’ should be treated as referring to

determined largely on the basis of the 
total amount of harm or loss, the 
quantity of a substance involved, or 
some other measure of aggregate harm, 
or where the offense behavior is ongoing 
or continuous in nature and the offense 
guideline is written to cover such 
behavior. 
Subsection (a)(2) applies to offenses 
covered by the following guidelines: 
§ 2A3.5; 
§§ 2B1.1, 2B1.4, 2B1.5, 2B4.1, 2B5.1, 
2B5.3, 2B6.1; 
§§ 2C1.1, 2C1.2, 2C1.8; 
§§ 2D1.1, 2D1.2, 2D1.5, 2D1.11, 
2D1.13; 
§§ 2E4.1, 2E5.1; 
§§ 2G2.2, 2G3.1; 
§ 2K2.1; 
§§ 2L1.1, 2L2.1; 
§ 2N3.1; 
§ 2Q2.1; 
§ 2R1.1; 
§§ 2S1.1, 2S1.3; 
§§ 2T1.1, 2T1.4, 2T1.6, 2T1.7, 2T1.9, 
2T2.1, 2T3.1. 
Subsection (a)(2) does not apply to the 
offenses covered by the following 
guidelines: 
all offenses in Chapter Two, Part A 
(except § 2A3.5); 
§§ 2B2.1, 2B2.3, 2B3.1, 2B3.2, 2B3.3; 
§ 2C1.5; 
§§ 2D2.1, 2D2.2, 2D2.3; 
§§ 2E1.3, 2E1.4, 2E2.1; 
§§ 2G1.1, 2G1.3, 2G2.1; 
§§ 2H1.1, 2H2.1, 2H4.1; 
§§ 2L2.2, 2L2.5; 
§§ 2M2.1, 2M2.3, 2M3.1, 2M3.2, 
2M3.3, 2M3.4, 2M3.5, 2M3.9; 
§§ 2P1.1, 2P1.2, 2P1.3; 
§ 2X6.1. 
For offenses covered by guidelines 
that are not listed, subsection (a)(2) may 
or may not apply. In such instances, a 
case-by-case determination must be 
made based upon the facts of the case 
and the applicable guidelines (including 
specific offense characteristics and other 
adjustments) used to determine the 
offense level. 
Subsection (a)(2) applies to counts 
involving offenses covered by different 
offense guidelines if the offenses are of 
the same general type and otherwise 
meet the criteria described in this 
subsection. The ‘same general type’ of 
offense is to be construed broadly.’’. 
The Commentary to § 1B1.3 captioned 
‘‘Application Notes’’ is amended— 
in Note 5(A) by striking the following: 
‘‘Relationship to Grouping of Multiple 
Counts.—‘Offenses of a character for 
which § 3D1.2(d) would require 
grouping of multiple counts,’ as used in 
subsection (a)(2), applies to offenses for 
which grouping of counts would be 
required under § 3D1.2(d) had the 
defendant been convicted of multiple 
counts. Application of this provision 
does not require the defendant, in fact, 
to have been convicted of multiple 
counts. For example, where the 
defendant engaged in three drug sales of 
10, 15, and 20 grams of cocaine, as part 
of the same course of conduct or 
common scheme or plan, subsection 
(a)(2) provides that the total quantity of 
cocaine involved (45 grams) is to be 
used to determine the offense level even 
if the defendant is convicted of a single 
count charging only one of the sales. If 
the defendant is convicted of multiple 
counts for the above noted sales, the 
grouping rules of Chapter Three, Part D 
(Multiple Counts) provide that the 
counts are grouped together. Although 
Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) 
applies to multiple counts of conviction, 
it does not limit the scope of subsection 
(a)(2). Subsection (a)(2) merely 
incorporates by reference the types of 
offenses set forth in § 3D1.2(d); thus, as 
discussed above, multiple counts of 
conviction are not required for 
subsection (a)(2) to apply. 
As noted above, subsection (a)(2) 
applies to offenses of a character for 
which § 3D1.2(d) would require 
grouping of multiple counts, had the 
defendant been convicted of multiple 
counts. For example, the defendant sells 
30 grams of cocaine (a violation of 21 
U.S.C. 841) on one occasion and, as part 
of the same course of conduct or 
common scheme or plan, attempts to 
sell an additional 15 grams of cocaine (a 
violation of 21 U.S.C. 846) on another 
occasion. The defendant is convicted of 
one count charging the completed sale 
of 30 grams of cocaine. The two offenses 
(sale of cocaine and attempted sale of 
cocaine), although covered by different 
statutory provisions, are of a character 
for which § 3D1.2(d) would require the 
grouping of counts, had the defendant 
been convicted of both counts. 
Therefore, subsection (a)(2) applies and 
the total amount of cocaine (45 grams) 
involved is used to determine the 
offense level.’’, 
and inserting the following: 
‘‘In General.—Application of 
subsection (a)(2) does not require the 
defendant, in fact, to have been 
convicted of multiple counts. For 
example, where the defendant engaged 
in three drug sales of 10, 15, and 20 
grams of cocaine, as part of the same 
course of conduct or common scheme or 
plan, subsection (a)(2) provides that the 
total quantity of cocaine involved (45 
grams) is to be used to determine the 
offense level even if the defendant is 
convicted of a single count charging 
only one of the sales. 
As noted in subsection (d), subsection 
(a)(2) applies to offenses where the 
offense level is determined largely on 
the basis of the total amount of harm or 
loss, the quantity of a substance 
involved, or some other measure of 
aggregate harm, or where the offense 
behavior is ongoing or continuous in 
nature and the offense guideline is 
written to cover such behavior. For 
example, the defendant sells 30 grams of 
cocaine (a violation of 21 U.S.C. 841) on 
one occasion and, as part of the same 
course of conduct or common scheme or 
plan, attempts to sell an additional 15 
grams of cocaine (a violation of 21 
U.S.C. 846) on another occasion. The 
defendant is convicted of one count 
charging the completed sale of 30 grams 
of cocaine. The two offenses (sale of 
cocaine and attempted sale of cocaine), 
although violating different statutory 
provisions, are covered by a guideline to 
which subsection (a)(2) is applicable 
pursuant to subsection (d). Therefore, 
subsection (a)(2) applies and the total 
amount of cocaine (45 grams) involved 
is used to determine the offense level.’’; 
and by inserting at the end the 
following new Note 11: 
‘‘11. Application of Subsection (d).— Subsection (d) provides that subsection 
(a)(2) covers most property crimes

The Commentary to § 1B1.3 captioned 
‘‘Background’’ is amended by striking 
‘‘The distinction is made on the basis of 
§ 3D1.2(d), which provides for grouping 
together (i.e., treating as a single count) all counts charging offenses of a type 
covered by this subsection. However,

does not depend upon whether multiple 
counts are alleged’’ and inserting ‘‘The 
distinction is made on the basis of

striking ‘‘Conversely, when § 3D1.2(d) 
does not apply, so that convictions on 
multiple counts are considered 
separately in determining the guideline 
sentencing range, the guidelines 
prohibit aggregation of quantities from 
other counts in order to prevent ‘double 
counting’ of the conduct and harm from 
each count of conviction. Continuing 
offenses present similar practical 
problems. The reference to § 3D1.2(d), 
which provides for grouping of multiple 
counts arising out of a continuing 
offense when the offense guideline takes 
the continuing nature into account, also 
prevents double counting.’’. 
Section 1B1.5(c) is amended by 
striking ‘‘Chapter Three (Adjustments)’’

§ 3D1.1(a) applies’’; and by striking 
‘‘(see §§ 3D1.1–3D1.5, 5G1.2)’’ and inserting ‘‘(see §§ 3D1.1, 5G1.2)’’. Section 2A1.4(b)(1) is amended by 
striking ‘‘Chapter Three, Part D

‘‘subsection (b) of § 3D1.1 (Procedure for

The Commentary to § 2A6.1 captioned 
‘‘Application Notes’’ is amended in 
Note 3 by striking the following: 
‘‘Grouping.—For purposes of Chapter 
Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), 
multiple counts involving making a 
threatening or harassing communication 
to the same victim are grouped together 
under § 3D1.2 (Groups of Closely 
Related Counts). Multiple counts 
involving different victims are not to be 
grouped under § 3D1.2.’’; 
and inserting the following: 
‘‘Multiple Counts.—For purposes of 
Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), 
do not apply subsection (b) of § 3D1.1 
(Procedure for Determining Offense 
Level on Multiple Counts) to multiple 
counts involving making a threatening 
or harassing communication to the same 
victim.’’. 
The Commentary to § 2A6.2 captioned 
‘‘Application Notes’’ is amended in 
Note 4 by striking the following: 
‘‘For purposes of Chapter Three, Part 
D (Multiple Counts), multiple counts 
involving stalking, threatening, or 
harassing the same victim are grouped 
together (and with counts of other 
offenses involving the same victim that 
are covered by this guideline) under 
§ 3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related 
Counts). For example, if the defendant 
is convicted of two counts of stalking 
the defendant’s ex-spouse under 18 
U.S.C. 2261A and one count of 
interstate domestic violence involving 
an assault of the ex-spouse under 18 
U.S.C. 2261, the stalking counts would 
be grouped together with the interstate 
domestic violence count. This grouping 
procedure avoids unwarranted ‘double 
counting’ with the enhancement in 
subsection (b)(1)(E) (for multiple acts of 
stalking, threatening, harassing, or 
assaulting the same victim) and 
recognizes that the stalking and 
interstate domestic violence counts are 
sufficiently related to warrant grouping. 
Multiple counts that are cross 
referenced to another offense guideline 
pursuant to subsection (c) are to be 
grouped together if § 3D1.2 (Groups of 
Closely Related Counts) would require 
grouping of those counts under that 
offense guideline. Similarly, multiple 
counts cross referenced pursuant to 
subsection (c) are not to be grouped 
together if § 3D1.2 would preclude 
grouping of the counts under that 
offense guideline. For example, if the 
defendant is convicted of multiple 
counts of threatening an ex-spouse in 
violation of a court protection order 
under 18 U.S.C. 2262 and the counts are 
cross referenced to § 2A6.1 (Threatening 
or Harassing Communications), the 
counts would group together because 
Application Note 3 of § 2A6.1 
specifically requires grouping. In 
contrast, if the defendant is convicted of 
multiple counts of assaulting the ex- 
spouse in violation of a court protection 
order under 18 U.S.C. 2262 and the 
counts are cross referenced to § 2A2.2 
(Aggravated Assault), the counts 
probably would not group together 
inasmuch as § 3D1.2(d) specifically 
precludes grouping of counts covered by 
§ 2A2.2 and no other provision of 
§ 3D1.2 would likely apply to require 
grouping. 
Multiple counts involving different 
victims are not to be grouped under 
§ 3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related 
Counts).’’; 
and inserting the following: 
‘‘For purposes of Chapter Three, Part 
D (Multiple Counts), do not apply 
subsection (b) of § 3D1.1 (Procedure for 
Determining Offense Level on Multiple

stalking, threatening, or harassing the 
same victim. For example, if the 
defendant is convicted of two counts of 
stalking the defendant’s ex-spouse 
under 18 U.S.C. 2261A and one count 
of interstate domestic violence 
involving an assault of the ex-spouse

count is to be determined

However, in the case of a conviction

failure to appear for service of sentence, 
the failure to appear is treated under

obstruction of the underlying offense,

3146(b)(2) does not require a sentence of 
imprisonment on a failure to appear 
count, although if a sentence of 
imprisonment on the failure to appear 
count is imposed, the statute requires 
that the sentence be imposed to run 
consecutively to any other sentence of 
imprisonment. Therefore, unlike a count

imprisonment, the grouping rules of 
§§ 3D1.1–3D1.5 apply. See § 3D1.1(b)(1), comment. (n.1), and § 3D1.2, comment.

For example, if the combined applicable

‘total punishment’ of 36 months is 
appropriate, a sentence of 30 months for 
the underlying offense plus a

these requirements. (Note that the

offense, do not apply any specific 
offense characteristic for possession, 
brandishing, use, or discharge of an 
explosive or firearm when determining 
the sentence for the underlying offense.

enhancement that would apply based on 
conduct for which the defendant is 
accountable under § 1B1.3 (Relevant 
Conduct). Do not apply any weapon 
enhancement in the guideline for the

which the defendant was convicted 
under 18 U.S.C. 924(c); or (B) in an 
ongoing drug trafficking offense, the 
defendant possessed a firearm other 
than the one for which the defendant 
was convicted under 18 U.S.C. 924(c). 
However, if a defendant is convicted of 
two armed bank robberies, but is 
convicted under 18 U.S.C. 924(c) in 
connection with only one of the 
robberies, a weapon enhancement 
would apply to the bank robbery which 
was not the basis for the 18 U.S.C. 
924(c) conviction. 
A sentence under this guideline also 
accounts for conduct that would subject 
the defendant to an enhancement under 
§ 2D1.1(b)(2) (pertaining to use of 
violence, credible threat to use violence, 
or directing the use of violence). Do not 
apply that enhancement when 
determining the sentence for the 
underlying offense. 
If the explosive or weapon that was 
possessed, brandished, used, or 
discharged in the course of the 
underlying offense also results in a 
conviction that would subject the 
defendant to an enhancement under 
§ 2K1.3(b)(3) (pertaining to possession 
of explosive material in connection with 
another felony offense) or 
§ 2K2.1(b)(7)(B) (pertaining to 
possession of any firearm or 
ammunition in connection with another 
felony offense), do not apply that 
enhancement. A sentence under this 
guideline accounts for the conduct 
covered by these enhancements because 
of the relatedness of that conduct to the 
conduct that forms the basis for the 
conviction under 18 U.S.C. 844(h), 
924(c) or 929(a). For example, if in 
addition to a conviction for an 
underlying offense of armed bank 
robbery, the defendant was convicted of 
being a felon in possession under 18 
U.S.C. 922(g), the enhancement under 
§ 2K2.1(b)(7)(B) would not apply. 
(B) Impact on Grouping.—If two or more counts would otherwise group 
under subsection (c) of § 3D1.2 (Groups 
of Closely Related Counts), the counts 
are to be grouped together under 
§ 3D1.2(c) despite the non-applicability 
of certain enhancements under 
Application Note 4(A). Thus, for 
example, in a case in which the 
defendant is convicted of a felon-in- 
possession count under 18 U.S.C. 922(g) 
and a drug trafficking count underlying 
a conviction under 18 U.S.C. 924(c), the 
counts shall be grouped pursuant to 
§ 3D1.2(c). The applicable Chapter Two 
guidelines for the felon-in-possession 
count and the drug trafficking count 
each include ‘conduct that is treated as 
a specific offense characteristic’ in the 
other count, but the otherwise 
applicable enhancements did not apply 
due to the rules in § 2K2.4 related to 18 
U.S.C. 924(c) convictions.’’; 
and inserting the following: 
‘‘Non-Applicability of Certain 
Enhancements.—If a sentence under 
this guideline is imposed in conjunction 
with a sentence for an underlying 
offense, do not apply any specific 
offense characteristic for possession, 
brandishing, use, or discharge of an 
explosive or firearm when determining 
the sentence for the underlying offense. 
A sentence under this guideline 
accounts for any explosive or weapon 
enhancement for the underlying offense 
of conviction, including any such 
enhancement that would apply based on 
conduct for which the defendant is 
accountable under § 1B1.3 (Relevant 
Conduct). Do not apply any weapon 
enhancement in the guideline for the 
underlying offense, for example, if (A) a 
co-defendant, as part of the jointly 
undertaken criminal activity, possessed 
a firearm different from the one for 
which the defendant was convicted 
under 18 U.S.C. 924(c); or (B) in an 
ongoing drug trafficking offense, the 
defendant possessed a firearm other 
than the one for which the defendant 
was convicted under 18 U.S.C. 924(c). 
However, if a defendant is convicted of 
two armed bank robberies, but is 
convicted under 18 U.S.C. 924(c) in 
connection with only one of the 
robberies, a weapon enhancement 
would apply to the bank robbery which 
was not the basis for the 18 U.S.C. 
924(c) conviction. 
A sentence under this guideline also 
accounts for conduct that would subject 
the defendant to an enhancement under 
§ 2D1.1(b)(2) (pertaining to use of 
violence, credible threat to use violence, 
or directing the use of violence). Do not 
apply that enhancement when 
determining the sentence for the 
underlying offense. 
If the explosive or weapon that was 
possessed, brandished, used, or 
discharged in the course of the 
underlying offense also results in a 
conviction that would subject the 
defendant to an enhancement under 
§ 2K1.3(b)(3) (pertaining to possession 
of explosive material in connection with 
another felony offense) or 
§ 2K2.1(b)(7)(B) (pertaining to 
possession of any firearm or

enhancement. A sentence under this 
guideline accounts for the conduct 
covered by these enhancements because 
of the relatedness of that conduct to the 
conduct that forms the basis for the 
conviction under 18 U.S.C. 844(h), 
924(c) or 929(a). For example, if in 
addition to a conviction for an 
underlying offense of armed bank 
robbery, the defendant was convicted of 
being a felon in possession under 18 
U.S.C. 922(g), the enhancement under 
§ 2K2.1(b)(7)(B) would not apply.’’.

‘‘Application Notes’’ is amended by 
striking Note 3 as follows: 
‘‘3. Grouping of Multiple Counts.—If subsection (b)(1) applies (because the 
defendant used the body armor in

Issues for Comment: 
1. The Commission seeks comment on 
whether it should simplify the operation 
of the multiple count rules. If so, does 
the proposed amendment achieve the 
goal of simplification? Alternatively, 
should the Commission simplify or 
clarify the application of these rules in 
a different manner? For example, should 
the Commission make more targeted 
revisions to Chapter Three, Part D to 
clarify the operation of the current 
rules? If so, what changes should the 
Commission make? Relatedly, if the 
Commission maintains the current 
structure of the multiple count rules, 
should it include its Grouping of 
Multiple Counts Decision Tree 
(available at https://www.ussc.gov/ 
education/training-resources/multiple- 
counts-quick-reference-materials) as a 
reference in the Guidelines Manual? 
2. When the Commission has 
previously undertaken simplification 
efforts of the Guidelines Manual, it has 
envisioned and framed proposed 
amendments to be outcome neutral. 
This proposed amendment likewise 
aims to be outcome neutral, recognizing 
that nevertheless there may be some 
cases resulting in higher guideline 
ranges and some cases resulting in 
lower guideline ranges. Are there any 
categories of cases resulting in higher or 
lower guideline ranges that should not 
result in a different guideline range? If 
so, what should the Commission do to 
address these cases while still achieving 
its goal of simplification? 
3. New § 3D1.1(b) provides that, if 
multiple counts use the same guideline 
and the guideline is listed therein, the 
offense level for each count is calculated 
separately and an adjustment based on 
the number counts applies to the count 
resulting in the highest offense level. 
The guidelines listed in new subsection 
(b) are not currently aggregated under 
§ 3D1.2(d) and generally cover offenses 
against a person and other offenses that 
in fiscal year 2024 resulted in a multiple 
count increase under § 3D1.4 on more 
than two cases. The Commission seeks 
comment on whether there are 
additional guidelines that should be

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259695 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Notices listed in new § 3D1.1(b). Alternatively, 
are there any listed guidelines that 
should be excluded from new 
§ 3D1.1(b)? 
New § 3D1.1(b) also lists six 
additional guidelines: § 2D2.3 
(Operating or Directing the Operation of 
a Common Carrier Under the Influence 
of Alcohol or Drugs); § 2J1.3 (Perjury or 
Subornation of Perjury; Bribery of 
Witness); § 2M6.1 (Unlawful Activity 
Involving Nuclear Material, Weapons, or 
Facilities, Biological Agents, Toxins, or 
Delivery Systems, Chemical Weapons, 
or Other Weapons of Mass Destruction; 
Attempt or Conspiracy); § 2N1.1 
(Tampering or Attempting to Tamper 
Involving Risk of Death or Bodily 
Injury); § 2Q1.4 (Tampering or 
Attempted Tampering with a Public 
Water System; Threatening to Tamper 
with a Public Water System); and 
§ 2X6.1 (Use of a Minor in a Crime of 
Violence). These guidelines contain 
instructions providing for a multiple 
count adjustment under certain 
circumstances. In fiscal year 2024, none 
of these instructions applied, and only 
one case involved one of these six 
guidelines (§ 2J1.3) and a multiple count 
adjustment. The Commission seeks 
comment on whether these guidelines 
should be excluded from the list in new 
§ 3D1.1(b) and the instructions found in 
each of these six guidelines also deleted. 
6. Simplification 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: In 
August 2025, the Commission identified 
as one of its policy priorities for the 
amendment cycle ending May 1, 2026, 
‘‘[c]ontinued exploration of ways to 
simplify the Guidelines Manual, 
including . . . evaluating infrequently 
applied specific offense characteristics 
and adjustments provisions throughout 
the Guidelines Manual; and . . . possible consideration of amendments 
that might be appropriate.’’ U.S. Sent’g 
Comm’n, ‘‘Notice of Final Priorities,’’ 90 
FR 39263, 39264 (Aug. 14, 2025). 
The initiative of simplifying the 
Guidelines Manual has persisted almost 
since the guidelines’ inception and has 
taken various forms over time. For 
example, in 1993, the Commission 
deleted ‘‘25 offense guidelines by 
consolidating them with other offense 
guidelines that cover similar offense 
conduct and have identical or very 
similar base offense levels and 
adjustments’’ for various reasons, 
including that ‘‘it shortens and 
simplifies the Guidelines Manual.’’ See 
USSG App. C, amend. 481 (effective 
Nov. 1, 1993). 
The Guidelines Manual includes 155 Chapter Two offense guidelines, 86 of 
which have at least one specific offense 
characteristic, for a total of 298 specific 
offense characteristics. Application rates 
for the 298 specific offense 
characteristics vary widely, both in 
terms of number of times used each year 
and frequency of use within the 
underlying guideline. 
The Commission is considering 
deleting 26 specific offense 
characteristics that courts did not apply 
at all in the last five fiscal years. These 
26 specific offense characteristics 
applied a small number of times—if at 
all—even using a 25-year lookback 
window. For some of these specific 
offense characteristics, low usage 
mirrored low usage of the underlying 
guideline. For others, the underlying 
guideline was applied a relatively large 
number of times, but the specific offense 
characteristic was infrequently applied. 
The proposed amendment would 
delete certain specific offense 
characteristics in the following 
guidelines: § 2A5.1 (Aircraft Piracy or 
Attempted Aircraft Piracy); § 2B1.5 
(Theft of, Damage to, or Destruction of, 
Cultural Heritage Resources or 
Paleontological Resources; Unlawful 
Sale, Purchase, Exchange, 
Transportation, or Receipt of Cultural 
Heritage Resources or Paleontological 
Resources); § 2B2.3 (Trespass); § 2B6.1 
(Altering or Removing Motor Vehicle 
Identification Numbers, or Trafficking 
in Motor Vehicles or Parts with Altered 
or Obliterated Identification Numbers); 
§ 2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, 
Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking 
(Including Possession with Intent to 
Commit These Offenses); Attempt or 
Conspiracy); § 2D1.11 (Unlawfully 
Distributing, Importing, Exporting or 
Possessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt 
or Conspiracy); § 2D1.12 (Unlawful 
Possession, Manufacture, Distribution, 
Transportation, Exportation, or 
Importation of Prohibited Flask, 
Equipment, Chemical, Product, or 
Material; Attempt or Conspiracy); 
§ 2D1.14 (Narco-Terrorism); § 2G3.2 
(Obscene Telephone Communications 
for a Commercial Purpose; Broadcasting 
Obscene Material); § 2H3.1 (Interception 
of Communications; Eavesdropping; 
Disclosure of Certain Private or 
Protected Information); § 2J1.3 (Perjury 
or Subornation of Perjury; Bribery of 
Witness); § 2J1.6 (Failure to Appear by 
Defendant); § 2J1.9 (Payment to 
Witness); § 2K1.5 (Possessing Dangerous 
Weapons or Materials While Boarding 
or Aboard an Aircraft); § 2K2.6 
(Possessing, Purchasing, or Owning 
Body Armor by Violent Felons); § 2M4.1 
(Failure to Register and Evasion of 
Military Service); § 2P1.1 (Escape, 
Instigating or Assisting Escape); § 2Q1.2 
(Mishandling of Hazardous or Toxic 
Substances or Pesticides; 
Recordkeeping, Tampering, and 
Falsification; Unlawfully Transporting 
Hazardous Materials in Commerce); 
§ 2Q1.3 (Mishandling of Other 
Environmental Pollutants; 
Recordkeeping, Tampering, and 
Falsification); § 2Q1.4 (Tampering or 
Attempted Tampering with a Public 
Water System; Threatening to Tamper 
with a Public Water System); and 
§ 2T1.9 (Conspiracy to Impede, Impair, 
Obstruct, or Defeat Tax). 
An issue for comment is also 
provided.

Conduct), the term ‘defendant’, for 
purposes of subsection (b)(1), limits the 
accountability of the defendant to the 
defendant’s own conduct and conduct 
that the defendant aided or abetted, 
counseled, commanded, induced, 
procured, or willfully caused. 
(B) Meaning of ‘Felony Offense’.—For purposes of subsection (b)(1), ‘felony 
offense’ means any offense (federal, 
state, or local) punishable by 
imprisonment for a term exceeding one 
year, regardless of whether a criminal 
charge was brought, or a conviction 
obtained. 
(C) Meaning of ‘Used’.—For purposes of subsection (b)(1), ‘used’ means the 
body armor was (i) actively employed in 
a manner to protect the person from 
gunfire; or (ii) used as a means of 
bartering. Subsection (b)(1) does not 
apply if the body armor was merely 
possessed. For example, subsection 
(b)(1) would not apply if the body armor 
was found in the trunk of a car but was 
not being actively used as protection. 
2. Inapplicability of § 3B1.5.—If 
subsection (b)(1) applies, do not apply 
the adjustment in §3B1.5 (Use of Body 
Armor in Drug Trafficking Crimes and 
Crimes of Violence). 
3. Grouping of Multiple Counts.
—If 
subsection (b)(1) applies (because the 
defendant used the body armor in 
connection with another felony offense) 
and the instant offense of conviction 
includes a count of conviction for that 
other felony offense, the counts of 
conviction for the 18 U.S.C. 931 offense 
and that other felony offense shall be 
grouped pursuant to subsection (c) of 
§ 3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related 
Counts).’’.

Issue for Comment 
1. The proposed amendment would 
delete 26 specific offense characteristics 
in Chapter Two that courts did not 
apply at all in the last five fiscal years. 
The Commission seeks comment on 
whether this approach is appropriate for 
these infrequently used specific offense 
characteristics. What would be lost, if 
anything, by deleting these specific 
offense characteristics? Should the 
Commission take a different approach to 
address these specific offense 
characteristics? 
7. Sophisticated Means 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: In 
August 2025, the Commission identified 
as one of its policy priorities for the 
amendment cycle ending May 1, 2026, 
‘‘[e]xamination of offenses involving 
sophisticated means and possible 
consideration of an additional Chapter 
Three adjustment that would account 
for the consideration of factors such as 
sophistication in the preparation for, 
commission of, or evasion of detection 
for an offense.’’ U.S. Sent’g Comm’n,

39263, 39264 (Aug. 14, 2025). 
The Guidelines Manual includes five guidelines that contain specific offense 
characteristics that expressly address 
‘‘sophisticated’’ conduct. Three tax 
guidelines provide the following 
‘‘sophisticated means’’ enhancement: ‘‘If 
the offense involved sophisticated 
means, increase by 2 levels. If the 
resulting offense level is less than level 
12, increase to level 12.’’ USSG 
§§ 2T1.1(b)(2), 2T1.4(b)(2), 2T3.1(b)(1). 
Section 2B1.1 (Theft, Property 
Destruction, and Fraud) provides a 
similar 2-level ‘‘sophisticated means’’ 
enhancement with an offense-level floor 
of 12 if ‘‘the offense otherwise involved 
sophisticated means and the defendant 
intentionally engaged in or caused the 
conduct constituting sophisticated 
means.’’ USSG § 2B1.1(b)(10)(C). 
Finally, § 2S1.1 (Laundering of 
Monetary Instruments; Engaging in 
Monetary Transactions in Property 
Derived from Unlawful Activity) 
provides a 2-level ‘‘sophisticated 
laundering’’ enhancement if the 
defendant was convicted under 18 
U.S.C. 1956 and ‘‘the offense involved 
sophisticated laundering.’’ USSG 
§ 2S1.1(b)(3). 
For purposes of these guidelines, 
‘‘sophisticated means’’ is defined as 
‘‘especially complex or especially 
intricate offense conduct pertaining to 
the execution or concealment of an 
offense. [] Conduct such as hiding assets 
or transactions, or both, through the use 
of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or 
offshore financial accounts [] ordinarily 
indicates sophisticated means.’’ USSG 
§§ 2B1.1, comment. (n.9(B)); 2T1.1, 
comment. (n.5); 2T1.4, comment. (n.3); 
2T3.1, comment. (n.2). ‘‘Sophisticated 
laundering’’ is defined as ‘‘complex or 
intricate offense conduct pertaining to 
the execution or concealment of the 18 
U.S.C. 1956 offense.’’ USSG § 2S1.1, 
comment. (n.5(A)). The Commentary to 
§ 2S1.1 also provides that 
Sophisticated laundering typically 
involves the use of— 
(i) fictitious entities; 
(ii) shell corporations; 
(iii) two or more levels (i.e., layering) of transactions, transportation, transfers, 
or transmissions, involving criminally 
derived funds that were intended to 
appear legitimate; or 
(iv) offshore financial accounts. 
Id. 
The Commission has received public 
comment expressing concern that the 
current ‘‘sophisticated means’’ specific 
offense characteristics are applied based 
on commonplace technologies. In 
addition, the Department of Justice 
asked the Commission to consider 
consolidating those specific offense 
characteristics into a broader Chapter 
Three adjustment. 
The proposed amendment sets forth 
two options to address these concerns. 
Option 1 would create a new Chapter 
Three adjustment at § 3C1.5. The new 
adjustment would provide a 2-level 
enhancement, with a possible offense- 
level floor of 12, if ‘‘the offense involved 
sophisticated means [and the defendant 
intentionally engaged in or caused the 
conduct involving sophisticated 
means].’’ It would also include a 
definition of ‘‘sophisticated means’’ that 
references the use of advanced or 
emerging technologies. The proposed 
amendment would make conforming 
changes to §§ 2B1.1, 2S1.1, 2T1.1, 
2T1.4, and 2T3.1 to delete the specific 
offense characteristics addressing 
sophisticated conduct. 
Option 2 would amend §§ 2B1.1, 
2S1.1, 2T1.1, 2T1.4, and 2T3.1 to 
provide updated, uniform guidance 
relating to sophisticated conduct. 
Issues for comment are also provided. 
Proposed Amendment: 
Option 1 (New Chapter Three 
Adjustment for Sophisticated Means) 
Chapter Three, Part C is amended by 
inserting at the end the following new 
guideline and accompanying 
commentary: 
‘‘§ 3C1.5. Sophisticated Means (a) If the offense involved 
sophisticated means [and the defendant 
intentionally engaged in or caused the 
conduct involving sophisticated means], 
increase by [2] levels. [If the resulting 
offense level is less than level [12], 
increase to level [12].] 
(b) For purposes of this guideline, 
‘sophisticated means’ means committing 
or concealing an offense with a greater 
level of complexity than typical for an 
offense of that nature. Such complexity 
may be achieved through various 
methods, including by using advanced 
or emerging technologies [in ways not 
routinely employed by everyday 
users][in a more specialized, elaborate, 
or unusual way than an ordinary user 
would]. Sophisticated means are often 
used to increase the scale of the offense 
or to make especially difficult the 
detection of the offense [or the detection 
of the defendant’s participation in the 
offense]. 
Commentary 
Application Notes: 
1. Interaction with Other Chapter Three Adjustments.—If the conduct that 
forms the basis for an adjustment under 
§ 3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or 
Use of Special Skill) is the only conduct 
that forms the basis for an adjustment 
under this guideline, do not apply an 
adjustment under this guideline. 
Similarly, if the conduct that forms 
the basis for an adjustment under 
§ 3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the 
Administration of Justice) is the only 
conduct that forms the basis for an 
adjustment under this guideline, do not 
apply this guideline.’’. 
Section 2B1.1(b)(10) is amended by 
striking ‘‘(B) a substantial part of a 
fraudulent scheme was committed from 
outside the United States; or (C) the 
offense otherwise involved 
sophisticated means and the defendant 
intentionally engaged in or caused the 
conduct constituting sophisticated 
means’’ and inserting ‘‘or (B) a 
substantial part of a fraudulent scheme 
was committed from outside the United 
States’’. 
The Commentary to § 2B1.1 captioned 
‘‘Application Notes’’ is amended in 
Note 9— 
by striking subparagraphs (B) and (C) 
as follows: 
‘‘(B) Sophisticated Means Enhancement under Subsection 
(b)(10)(C).—For purposes of subsection 
(b)(10)(C), ‘sophisticated means’ means 
especially complex or especially 
intricate offense conduct pertaining to 
the execution or concealment of an 
offense. For example, in a telemarketing 
scheme, locating the main office of the 
scheme in one jurisdiction but locating 
soliciting operations in another 
jurisdiction ordinarily indicates

Issues for Comment 
1. Option 1 of the proposed 
amendment would add a new Chapter 
Three adjustment for sophisticated 
means that would apply across all 
offense types covered by Chapter Two of 
the guidelines. The Commission seeks 
comment on whether the base offense 
levels in Chapter Two currently cover 
‘‘typical’’ offense conduct or whether 
any base offense levels account for 
‘‘sophisticated’’ offense conduct. If the 
Commission were to promulgate Option 
1 of the proposed amendment, are there 
any Chapter Two offense conduct 
guidelines or types of offenses that 
should be excluded from application of

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with NOTICES259702 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Notices the adjustment? If so, which guidelines 
or types of offenses? 
2. Option 1 of the proposed 
amendment would delete the five 
specific offense characteristics that 
currently address ‘‘sophisticated’’ 
conduct in certain Chapter Two 
guidelines. Other specific offense 
characteristics address different aspects 
of offense conduct that also could be 
considered markers of sophistication, 
such as: 
€the amount of planning involved (see USSG §§ 2A2.2(b)(1); 2B2.1(b)(1); 2J1.2(b)(3)(C)); 
€the use of technology, namely the use of a computer or an interactive 
computer service (see USSG §§ 2A3.1(b)(6)(B); 2A3.2(b)(3); 
2A3.3(b)(2); 2A3.4(b)(5); 2D1.1(b)(7); 
2D1.11(b)(4); 2D1.12(b)(3); 2G1.3(b)(3); 
2G2.1(b)(6)(B); 2G2.2(b)(6); 2G2.6(b)(4); 
2G3.1(b)(3); 2H3.1(b)(2)(B)); and 
€ongoing, recurring criminal conduct with a large scope (see USSG §§ 2B1.1(b)(15); 2B6.1(b)(3)). 
Are there any other specific offense 
characteristics or Chapter Three 
adjustments that address sophisticated 
ways in which an offense may be 
committed or concealed? If the 
Commission were to promulgate Option 
1 of the proposed amendment, how 
should the new adjustment interact with 
these specific offense characteristics and 
adjustments? Should these specific 
offense characteristics be deleted from 
Chapter Two and the conduct covered 
by these provisions be integrated into 
the proposed Chapter Three adjustment? 
Alternatively, should the proposed 
adjustment not apply if any of these 
specific offense characteristics also 
applies? 
3. Both Option 1 and Option 2 of the 
proposed amendment would define 
‘‘sophisticated’’ conduct as ‘‘committing 
or concealing an offense with a greater 
level of complexity than typical for an 
offense of that nature.’’ The definition 
would also include a provision stating 
that the complexity required by the 
‘‘sophisticated’’ conduct definition 
‘‘may be achieved through various 
methods, including by using advanced 
or emerging technologies [in ways not 
routinely employed by everyday 
users][in a more specialized, elaborate, 
or unusual way than an ordinary user 
would].’’ The Commission seeks 
comment on whether the proposed 
amended definition of ‘‘sophisticated’’ 
conduct is the appropriate definition. Is 
it an improvement over the current 
definitions? Should the Commission 
provide guidance regarding the level of 
complexity that is typical for an offense 
of that nature? If so, what type of 
guidance should the Commission 
provide? Further, should the 
Commission provide additional 
guidance on what should be considered 
‘‘advanced or emerging technologies’’ or 
on how such technologies must be used 
for purposes of applying the proposed 
definition? If so, what guidance should 
the Commission provide? 
Additionally, Option 2 of the 
proposed amendment would bracket the 
possibility of maintaining the examples 
of ‘‘sophisticated’’ conduct provided in 
the Commentary to § 2B1.1, § 2S1.1, 
§ 2T1.1, § 2T1.4, and § 2T3.1. If the 
Commission amends the definition of 
‘‘sophisticated’’ conduct, should the 
Commission maintain these examples? 
If not, should the Commission add 
additional factors or other provisions to 
the definition of ‘‘sophisticated’’ 
conduct? 
8. Miscellaneous 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: 
This proposed amendment responds to 
recently enacted legislation and a 
miscellaneous issue. See U.S. Sent’g Comm’n, ‘‘Notice of Final Priorities,’’ 90 
FR 39263 (Aug. 14, 2025) (identifying as 
a priority ‘‘[i]mplementation of any 
legislation warranting Commission 
action’’ and ‘‘[c]onsideration of other 
miscellaneous issues coming to the 
Commission’s attention’’). 
The proposed amendment contains 
five parts (Parts A through E). The 
Commission is considering whether to 
promulgate any or all these parts, as 
they are not mutually exclusive. 
Part A responds to the Tools to 
Address Known Exploitation by 
Immobilizing Technological Deepfakes 
on websites and Networks Act (‘‘TAKE 
IT DOWN Act’’), Public Law 119–12 
(2025), by amending Appendix A

Color of Official Right; Fraud Involving 
the Deprivation of the Intangible Right 
to Honest Services of Public Officials; 
Conspiracy to Defraud by Interference 
with Governmental Functions). An issue 
for comment is provided. 
Part E would amend the Appendix A 
reference for 18 U.S.C. 1348, dealing 
with securities and commodities fraud, 
by referencing the statute to § 2B1.4 
(Insider Trading), while also 
maintaining the current reference to 
§ 2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, 
and Fraud). 
(A) TAKE IT DOWN Act 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: 
Part A of the proposed amendment 
responds to the Tools to Address 
Known Exploitation by Immobilizing 
Technological Deepfakes on websites 
and Networks Act (‘‘TAKE IT DOWN 
Act’’), Public Law 119–12 (2025). 
The act added new offenses to section 
223 (Obscene or harassing telephone 
calls) of title 47, United States Code. 
The new offenses relate to the 
disclosure of nonconsensual visual 
depictions and digital forgeries 
involving both adults and minors, at 
subsections 223(h)(2) and (h)(3). Those 
subsections now proscribe: 
€Using an interactive computer service to knowingly publish an 
intimate visual depiction of (1) an 
identifiable adult if certain conditions 
are met, or (2) an identifiable minor 
under 18 years old with intent to abuse 
humiliate, harass, or degrade the minor 
or with intent to arouse or gratify the 
sexual desire of any person. 
€Using an interactive computer service to knowingly publish a digital 
forgery of (1) an adult if certain 
conditions are met, or (2) a minor under 
18 years old with intent to abuse 
humiliate, harass, or degrade the minor 
or with intent to arouse or gratify the 
sexual desire of any person. 
Sections 223(h)(2)(A) and (h)(3)(A), 
involving depictions and digital 
forgeries of an adult, have a statutory 
maximum of two years. Sections 
223(h)(2)(B) and (h)(3)(B), involving 
depictions or digital forgeries of a 
minor, have a statutory maximum of 
three years. 
The act also included two new 
offenses at subsection 223(h)(6) related 
to threats to use an interactive computer

depictions or digital forgeries involving 
adults and minors. The statutory 
maximum is as follows: two years for a 
threat involving an intimate visual 
depiction of an adult (47 U.S.C. 
223(h)(6)(A)); three years for a threat 
involving an intimate visual depiction 
of a minor (47 U.S.C. 223(h)(6)(A)); 18 
months for a threat involving a digital 
forgery of an adult (47 U.S.C. 
223(h)(6)(B)(i)); and 30 months for a 
threat involving a digital forgery of a 
minor (47 U.S.C. 223(h)(6)(B)(ii)). 
Currently, offenses involving 
harassment, abuse, and threatening 
conduct under 47 U.S.C. 223 are 
referenced in Appendix A (Statutory 
Index) to § 2A6.1 (Threatening or 
Harassing Communications; Hoaxes; 
False Liens). Given the similar nature of 
the conduct, Part A of the proposed 
amendment would amend Appendix A 
to reference the new offenses under 47 
U.S.C. 223 to § 2A6.1. It would also 
amend the Commentary to § 2A6.1 to 
reflect the new references. 
An issue for comment is also 
provided. 
Proposed Amendment: 
Appendix A (Statutory Index) is 
amended by inserting before the line 
referenced to 47 U.S.C. 409(m) the 
following new line references: 
‘‘47 U.S.C. 223(h)(2)(A) 2A6.1 
47 U.S.C. 223(h)(2)(B) 2A6.1

47 U.S.C. 223(h)(6)(B)(i) 2A6.1 
47 U.S.C. 223(h)(6)(B)(ii) 2A6.1’’. 
The Commentary to § 2A6.1 captioned 
‘‘Statutory Provisions’’ is amended by 
striking ‘‘47 U.S.C. 223(a)(1)(C)–(E)’’ and 
inserting ‘‘47 U.S.C. 223(a)(1)(C)–(E),

(h)(6)(A), (h)(6)(B)(i)–(ii)’’. 
Issue for Comment 
1. The Commission seeks comment on 
whether the proposed references are 
appropriate and whether any additional 
changes to the guidelines are required to 
account for the new criminal offenses 
created by the Tools to Address Known 
Exploitation by Immobilizing 
Technological Deepfakes on websites 
and Networks Act (‘‘TAKE IT DOWN 
Act’’), Public Law 119–12 (2025). Would 
it be more appropriate to reference some 
or all of the new offenses to a different 
guideline, such as § 2B3.3 (Blackmail 
and Similar Forms of Extortion) or 
§ 2G3.1 (Importing, Mailing, or 
Transporting Obscene Matter; 
Transferring Obscene Matter to a Minor; 
Misleading Domain Names)? 
(B) Fentanyl Eradication and Narcotics 
Deterrence Off Fentanyl Act 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: 
Part B responds to the Fentanyl 
Eradication and Narcotics Deterrence 
Off Fentanyl Act (‘‘FEND Off Fentanyl 
Act’’), Public Law 118–50 (2024). The 
Act creates two new offenses, 21 U.S.C. 
2313a and 2354, to apply economic and 
other financial sanctions to the 
international trafficking of fentanyl, its 
precursors, and other related opioids. 
Title I of the Fend Off Fentanyl Act 
includes sections 2353 and 2354 to a 
new chapter 28A (Fentanyl Eradication 
and Narcotics Deterrence off Fentanyl) 
to title 21 (Food and Drugs) of the 
United States Code. Section 2353 
(Imposition of sanctions with respect to 
fentanyl trafficking by transnational 
criminal organizations) requires the 
President to impose sanctions on 
foreigners knowingly involved in: (1) 
significant trafficking of fentanyl, its 
precursors, or other related opioids, 
including by transnational criminal 
organizations; or (2) significant 
activities of a transnational criminal 
organization that relate to trafficking 
such substances. The provided 
sanctions are those authorized by the 
International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (‘‘IEEPA’’). 
Section 2354 (Penalties; waivers; 
exceptions) provides that any person 
who violates or causes a violation of the 
section, and attempts or conspires to 
violate, any regulation, license, or order 
issued to carry out the section is subject 
to the civil and criminal penalties set 
forth in 50 U.S.C. 1705 of the IEEPA ‘‘to 
the same extent as a person who 
commits an unlawful act described in 
subsection (a) of that section.’’ Section 
1705 prohibits willfully violating, 
attempting or conspiring to violate, or 
causing a violation of any license, order, 
regulation, or prohibition issued under 
the IEEPA. The statutory maximum for 
a criminal violation of the IEEPA at 
section 1705(c) is 20 years. 
Title II of the FEND Off Fentanyl Act 
added a new provision to chapter 28 
(Sanctions with Respect to Foreign 
Trafficking of Illicit Synthetic Opioids) 
of title 21 of the United States Code. 
Section 2313a (Designation of 
transactions of sanctioned persons as of 
primary money laundering concern) 
provides the Secretary of the Treasury 
authority to issue orders or regulations 
for certain domestic financial 
institutions and agencies. Specifically, if 
the Secretary determines financial 
institutions operating outside the 
United States, or certain classes of 
transactions or types of accounts within 
a jurisdiction outside the United States, 
is ‘‘of primary money laundering 
concern’’ in connection with trafficking 
of illicit opioids, he is authorized, by 
order, regulation, or otherwise, to: (1) 
require domestic financial institutions 
and agencies to take special measures as 
provided in the William M. (Mac) 
Thornberry National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, 
and found at 31 U.S.C. 5318A; or (2) 
prohibit or impose conditions upon, 
certain transmittal of funds by the 
financial institution or agency. A 
finding that a jurisdiction, financial 
institution, account, or transaction is ‘‘of 
primary money laundering concern’’ is 
as determined under section 5318A, 
including whether: (1) organized 
criminal groups, international terrorists, 
or entities involved in the proliferation 
of weapons of mass destruction or 
missiles have transacted business in a 
certain jurisdiction; (2) a jurisdiction 
offers bank secrecy or special regulatory 
advantages to nonresidents; and (3) a 
jurisdiction is an offshore banking or 
secrecy haven. 
The statutory maximum for violating 
any order, regulation, special measure, 
or other requirement imposed under 
section 2313a(d) is five years for a 
simple violation, as provided in 31 
U.S.C. 5322 (Criminal Penalties). The 
statutory maximum is ten years, if the 
offense was committed ‘‘while violating 
another law of the United States or as 
part of a pattern of any illegal activity 
involving more than $100,000 in a 12- 
month period.’’ 
Part B of the proposed amendment 
would amend Appendix A (Statutory 
Index) to reference 21 U.S.C. 2313a and 
2354 to § 2S1.3 (Structuring 
Transactions to Evade Reporting 
Requirements; Failure to Report Cash or 
Monetary Transactions; Failure to File 
Currency and Monetary Instrument 
Report; Knowingly Filing False Reports; 
Bulk Cash Smuggling; Establishing or 
Maintaining Prohibited Accounts) 
because the offenses concern monetary 
sanctions related to the illicit 
transnational trafficking of fentanyl, its 
precursors, and other related opioids. 
Part B of the proposed amendment 
would also amend the commentary to 
§ 2S1.3 to reflect the reference. 
An issue for comment is also 
provided. 
Proposed Amendment: 
Appendix A (Statutory Index) is 
amended by inserting before the line 
referenced to 22 U.S.C. 1980(g) the 
following new line references: 
‘‘21 U.S.C. 2313a § 2S1.3

Issue for Comment 
1. The Commission seeks comment on 
whether the proposed references are 
appropriate and whether any additional 
changes to the guidelines are required to 
account for the new criminal offenses 
created by the Fentanyl Eradication and 
Narcotics Deterrence Off Fentanyl Act 
(‘‘FEND Off Fentanyl Act’’), Public Law 
118–50 (2024). 
(C) Protecting Americans’ Data From 
Foreign Adversaries Act 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: 
Part C of the proposed amendment 
responds to the Protecting Americans’ 
Data from Foreign Adversaries Act, 
Public Law 118–50 (2024), by amending 
Appendix A and § 2H3.1 (Interception 
of Communications; Eavesdropping; 
Disclosure of Certain Private or 
Protected Information). The act codified 
a new offense at 15 U.S.C. 9901 
prohibiting the transfer of personally 
identifiable sensitive data of United 
States individuals to foreign adversaries. 
Section 9901 (Prohibition on transfer 
of personally identifiable sensitive data 
of United States individuals to foreign 
adversaries) prohibits data brokers from 
selling, licensing, trading, disclosing, or 
providing access to personally 
identifiable sensitive data of an 
individual of the United States to any 
foreign adversary country or any entity 
controlled by a foreign adversary. 
Section 9901(b)(2)(B) provides that 
the penalties for a violation are the same 
as provided in the Federal Trade 
Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41–58). 
Section 50 (Offenses and penalties) of 
title 15 provides, in turn, a statutory 
maximum of one year, for anyone who 
refuses to attend, testify or answer any 
lawful inquiry or produce documentary 
evidence ‘‘in obedience to an order of a 
district court . . . directing compliance 
with the subpoena or lawful 
requirement’’ of the Federal Trade 
Commission, and for officers or 
employees of the Commission who 
make any information obtained by the 
Commission public without authority. 
Section 50 also provides a statutory 
maximum of three years, for willfully 
making any false entry or statement of 
fact in certain reports, accounts or 
records of any person, partnership, or 
corporation subject to the Act, or 
removing from the jurisdiction or 
mutilating, altering, or otherwise 
falsifying any documentary evidence. 
Part C of the proposed amendment 
would amend Appendix A (Statutory 
Index) to reference 15 U.S.C. 9901 to 
§ 2H3.1 (Interception of 
Communications; Eavesdropping; 
Disclosure of Certain Private or 
Protected Information) because the 
prohibited conduct appears most similar 
to the offenses currently referenced to 
that guideline. 
Part C of the proposed amendment 
would also amend the commentary to 
§ 2H3.1 to reflect the reference. 
An issue for comment is also 
provided. 
Proposed Amendment: 
Appendix A (Statutory Index) is 
amended by inserting before the line 
referenced to 16 U.S.C. 114 the 
following new line reference: 
‘‘15 U.S.C. 9901 2H3.1’’. 
The Commentary to § 2H3.1 captioned 
‘‘Statutory Provisions’’ is amended by 
striking ‘‘8 U.S.C. 1375a(d)(5)(B)(i), (ii);’’ 
and inserting ‘‘8 U.S.C. 
1375a(d)(5)(B)(i), (ii); 15 U.S.C. 9901;’’. 
Issue for Comment 
1. The Commission seeks comment on 
whether the proposed references are 
appropriate and whether any additional 
changes to the guidelines are required to 
account for the new criminal offenses 
created by the Protecting Americans’ 
Data from Foreign Adversaries Act, 
Public Law 118–50 (2024). 
(D) Foreign Extortion Prevention 
Technical Corrections Act 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: 
Part D of the proposed amendment 
responds to the Foreign Extortion 
Prevention Technical Corrections Act, 
Public Law 118–78 (2024). 
The Foreign Extortion Prevention 
Technical Corrections Act repealed and 
replaced the Foreign Extortion 
Prevention Act, which in 2023 
established criminal liability for foreign 
officials who solicit or accept bribes 
from United States entities or while 
within United States territory. By 
criminalizing the ‘‘demand side’’ of 
bribery by foreign officials, the Act was 
a new counterpart to the Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act, which 
criminalizes the ‘‘supply side’’ by 
prohibiting the paying of bribes to 
foreign officials to influence an act or 
decision of such official in his official 
capacity, at 15 U.S.C. 78dd–2 and 78dd– 
3. 
The Foreign Extortion Prevention Act 
had added subsection 201(f) (Bribery of 
public officials and witnesses) to title 18 
of the United States Code. Section 201(f) 
prohibited foreign officials (or those 
selected to be foreign officials) from 
corruptly demanding, receiving, or 
accepting anything of value from any 
‘‘person’’ while located in the United 
States, or from a ‘‘domestic concern’’ (as 
those terms are defined in sections 
78dd–2 and 78dd–3 of the Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act), or from an 
issuer, in return for being influenced or 
induced, or conferring any improper 
advantage in connection with obtaining 
or retaining business for or with any 
person. The Foreign Extortion 
Prevention Technical Corrections Act 
replaced subsection 201(f) with a 
substantively similar prohibition against 
bribery by foreign officials, at a new 
section 1352 (Demands by foreign 
officials for bribes) of title 18 of the 
United States Code. Both the repealed 
subsection 201(f) and section 1352 have 
a statutory maximum of 15 years. 
Part D of the proposed amendment 
would amend Appendix A (Statutory 
Index) to reference 18 U.S.C. 1352 to 
§ 2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or 
Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under 
Color of Official Right; Fraud Involving 
the Deprivation of the Intangible Right 
to Honest Services of Public Officials; 
Conspiracy to Defraud by Interference 
with Governmental Functions), because 
the complementary bribery offenses 
under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
at 15 U.S.C. 78dd–2 and 78dd–3 are 
referenced to § 2C1.1 
Part D of the proposed amendment 
would also amend the commentary to 
§ 2C1.1 to reflect the reference. 
An issue for comment is also 
provided. 
Proposed Amendment: 
Appendix A (Statutory Index) is 
amended by inserting before the line 
referenced to 18 U.S.C. 1361 the 
following new line reference: 
‘‘18 U.S.C. 1352 2C1.1’’. 
The Commentary to § 2C1.1 captioned 
‘‘Statutory Provisions’’ is amended by 
striking ‘‘18 U.S.C. 201(b)(1), (2), 226, 
227, 371 (if conspiracy to defraud by 
interference with governmental 
functions), 872, 1341 (if the scheme or 
artifice to defraud was to deprive 
another of the intangible right of honest

Issue for Comment 
1. The Commission seeks comment on 
whether the proposed references are 
appropriate and whether any additional 
changes to the guidelines are required to 
account for the new criminal offenses 
created by the Foreign Extortion 
Prevention Technical Corrections Act, 
Public Law 118–78 (2024). 
(E) Securities and Commodities Fraud 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: 
Part E of the proposed amendment 
would amend the reference for 18 U.S.C. 
1348, dealing with securities and 
commodities fraud, in Appendix A 
(Statutory Index). Section 1348 
prohibits the execution of a scheme or 
artifice (1) to defraud any person in 
connection with any commodity for 
future delivery, any option on a 
commodity for future delivery, or any 
security of certain issues, or (2) to 
fraudulently obtain any money or 
property in connection with the 
purchase or sale of any commodity for 
future delivery, any option on a 
commodity for future delivery, or any 
security of certain issues. 
Currently, offenses under 18 U.S.C. 
1348 are referenced in Appendix A to 
§ 2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, 
and Fraud). Section 2B1.1(b)(1) provides 
an enhancement under the loss table 
based on the amount of loss involved in 
the offense. However, it has been 
brought to the Commission’s attention 
that, for some 18 U.S.C. 1348 offenses, 
loss does not adequately account for the 
defendant’s true culpability in the 
offense. Instead, such offenses are more 
similar in nature to those insider trading 
offenses that are referenced to § 2B1.4 
(Insider Trading), which provides an 
enhancement based on the amount of 
gain resulting from the offense. 
To respond to this concern, Part E of 
the proposed amendment would amend 
Appendix A to reference 18 U.S.C. 1348 
to § 2B1.4 (Insider Trading), while also 
maintaining the current reference to 
§ 2B1.1. 
Part E of the proposed amendment 
would also amend the commentary to 
§ 2B1.4 to reflect the reference. 
Proposed Amendment: 
Appendix A (Statutory Index) is 
amended in the line referenced to 18 
U.S.C. 1348 by striking ‘‘2B1.1’’ and 
inserting ‘‘2B1.1, 2B1.4’’. 
The Commentary to § 2B1.4 captioned 
‘‘Statutory Provisions’’ is amended by 
striking ‘‘15 U.S.C. 78j,’’ and inserting 
‘‘15 U.S.C. 78j, 18 U.S.C. 1348,’’. 
9. Technical 
Synopsis of Proposed Amendment: 
This proposed amendment would make 
technical and other non-substantive 
changes to the Guidelines Manual. 
First, the proposed amendment makes 
clerical changes to several guidelines to 
replace references to the ‘‘Bureau of 
Prisons’’ with more accurate references 
to the ‘‘Federal Bureau of Prisons.’’ It 
makes changes to the following 
guidelines: § 1B1.13 (Reduction in Term 
of Imprisonment Under 18 U.S.C. 
3582(c)(1)(A) (Policy Statement)); 
§ 5E1.2 (Fines for Individual 
Defendants); § 5F1.7 (Shock 
Incarceration Program (Policy 
Statement)); § 5F1.8 (Intermittent 
Confinement); and § 5G1.3 (Imposition 
of a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to 
an Undischarged Term of Imprisonment 
or Anticipated State Term of 
Imprisonment). 
Second, the proposed amendment 
makes technical changes to update the 
references to the Communications Act 
of 1934 in the context of the definition 
of the term ‘‘interactive computer 
service,’’ which is used by several 
guidelines. It makes changes to the 
following guidelines: § 2A3.1 (Criminal 
Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit 
Criminal Sexual Abuse); § 2A3.2 
(Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor 
Under the Age of Sixteen Years 
(Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit 
Such Acts); § 2A3.3 (Criminal Sexual 
Abuse of a Ward or Attempt to Commit 
Such Acts; Criminal Sexual Abuse of an 
Individual in Federal Custody); § 2A3.4 
(Abusive Sexual Contact or Attempt to 
Commit Abusive Sexual Contact); 
§ 2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, 
Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking 
(Including Possession with Intent to 
Commit These Offenses); Attempt or 
Conspiracy); § 2D1.11 (Unlawfully 
Distributing, Importing, Exporting or 
Possessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt 
or Conspiracy); § 2D1.12 (Unlawful 
Possession, Manufacture, Distribution, 
Transportation, Exportation, or 
Importation of Prohibited Flask, 
Equipment, Chemical, Product, or 
Material; Attempt or Conspiracy); 
§ 2G1.3 (Promoting a Commercial Sex 
Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct with 
a Minor; Transportation of Minors to 
Engage in a Commercial Sex Act or 
Prohibited Sexual Conduct; Travel to 
Engage in Commercial Sex Act or 
Prohibited Sexual Conduct with a 
Minor; Sex Trafficking of Children; Use 
of Interstate Facilities to Transport 
Information about a Minor); § 2G2.1 
(Sexually Exploiting a Minor by 
Production of Sexually Explicit Visual 
or Printed Material; Custodian 
Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually 
Explicit Conduct; Advertisement for 
Minors to Engage in Production); 
§ 2G2.2 (Trafficking in Material 
Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a 
Minor; Receiving, Transporting, 
Shipping, Soliciting, or Advertising 
Material Involving the Sexual 
Exploitation of a Minor; Possessing 
Material Involving the Sexual 
Exploitation of a Minor with Intent to 
Traffic; Possessing Material Involving 
the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor); 
§ 2G2.6 (Child Exploitation Enterprises); 
§ 2G3.1 (Importing, Mailing, or 
Transporting Obscene Matter; 
Transferring Obscene Matter to a Minor; 
Misleading Domain Names); and 
§ 2H3.1 (Interception of 
Communications; Eavesdropping; 
Disclosure of Certain Private or 
Protected Information). The proposed 
amendment also makes other non- 
substantive changes to some of these 
guidelines to provide stylistic 
consistency in how subdivisions are 
designated and to correct some 
typographical errors. 
Third, the proposed amendment 
makes technical changes to § 7B1.4 
(Term of Imprisonment—Probation 
(Policy Statement)) and § 7C1.5 (Term of 
Imprisonment—Supervised Release 
(Policy Statement)), to clarify statutory 
references regarding a court’s authority 
to provide an exception to mandatory 
revocation of probation or supervised 
release in the case of a defendant who 
fails a drug test. 
Fourth, the proposed amendment 
makes a technical change to § 7C1.1 
(Classification of Violations (Policy 
Statement)) to correct an inaccurate 
reference to ‘‘four’’ grades of supervised 
release violations. 
Fifth, the proposed amendment makes 
technical changes to § 8A1.2 
(Application Instructions— 
Organizations) and § 8C2.8 (Determining 
the Fine Within the Range (Policy 
Statement)), to replace references to the 
‘‘guideline range’’ with more accurate 
references to the ‘‘guideline fine range.’’ 
Finally, the proposed amendment 
would make clerical changes to 
Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reflect 
the editorial reclassification of certain 
sections in the United States Code. 
Proposed Amendment: 
Section 1B1.13(a) is amended by 
striking ‘‘Bureau of Prisons’’ and

59717 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Presidential Documents Proclamation 10998 of December 16, 2025 
Restricting and Limiting the Entry of Foreign Nationals To 
Protect the Security of the United States 
By the President of the United States of America 
A Proclamation 
During my first Administration, I restricted the entry of certain foreign 
nationals into the United States to prevent national security and public 
safety threats from reaching our borders. The Supreme Court upheld these 
restrictions. I reinstated these successful policies in Executive Order 14161 
of January 20, 2025 (Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists 
and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats), and Proclamation 
10949 of June 4, 2025 (Restricting the Entry of Foreign Nationals To Protect 
the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and 
Public Safety Threats). 
It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from foreign 
nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national secu-
rity and public safety, incite hate crimes, or otherwise exploit the immigration 
laws for malevolent purposes. 
The United States must exercise extreme vigilance during the visa-issuance 
and immigration processes to identify, prior to their admission or entry 
into the United States, foreign nationals who intend to harm Americans 
or our national interests. The United States Government must ensure that 
admitted aliens do not intend to threaten its citizens; undermine or desta-
bilize its culture, government, institutions, or founding principles; or advo-
cate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists or other threats to 
our national security. 
In order to protect our Nation, as directed in Executive Order 14161, the 
Secretary of State, in coordination with the Attorney General, the Secretary 
of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, identified 
countries throughout the world for which screening and vetting information 
was so deficient as to warrant a full or partial suspension of the admission 
of nationals from those countries pursuant to section 212(f) of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1182(f). Accordingly, in Proclamation 
10949, I restricted the entry of foreign nationals into the United States 
from countries with deficient screening and vetting information to protect 
the national security and public safety of the United States and its people. 
The proclamation also directed the United States Government to immediately 
engage countries identified in the proclamation on measures that must be 
taken to comply with the screening, vetting, immigration, and security re-
quirements of the United States. 
Despite those engagements, most of the countries identified in Proclamation 
10949, as well as others, continue to exhibit woeful inadequacies in screen-
ing, vetting, and provision of information. At least one country lacks mecha-
nisms in hospitals to ensure births are reported, and widespread corruption, 
combined with a general lack of vetting and poor recordkeeping, result 
in any non-citizen being able to obtain any civil document from that country, 
particularly if that person is willing to pay a fee or engage an individual 
that specializes in assisting in such fraud. In that same country, law enforce-
ment records are not maintained with the accuracy or consistency necessary 
to provide representations of individuals’ criminal histories to the United

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC359718 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Presidential Documents States Government. In another country, civil documents like marriage licenses 
and birth certificates are handwritten and stamped on regular paper, making 
them highly susceptible to alteration, and there is a fraudulent document 
market that produces all types of falsified records, making written corrobora-
tion of any visa application practically impossible. In yet another country, 
criminal records are widely unreliable and inaccessible. And in another, 
United States visas are used as a tool for illicit transborder movement 
of assets by corrupt government officials and organized criminal groups. 
Corruption in another country even extends to the national school system, 
which has provided falsified diplomas and grade information in the past 
to fraudsters who have tried to obtain student visas and eligibility for large 
athletic scholarships. The government of another country refuses to provide 
passport exemplars, undermining the United States Government’s ability 
to detect fraudulent documents. In another country, the population, for 
the most part, does not formally document life events. This makes effective 
verification of basic biographical data such as birthdates, marriages, and 
parentage exceedingly difficult, if not impossible. Such countries warrant 
continued or new travel restrictions. 
Further, after continuing their review, and in light of the experience gained 
since the issuance of Proclamation 10949 and the reaction of foreign countries 
to the issuance of that proclamation, the Secretary of State, the Attorney 
General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National 
Intelligence have identified additional countries that cannot meet basic cri-
teria for identifying their nationals and residents who pose national security 
and public safety threats and for sharing information with the United States. 
For example, only 40 percent of one country’s territory is under complete 
government control, and officials there have noted that their ability to se-
curely process, house, or monitor non citizens is constrained. In another 
country, corruption in various forms is pervasive. Other countries have 
been subject to successful efforts to overthrow or undermine their govern-
ments, with the result that radical terrorist groups operate with minimal, 
if any, interference from law enforcement, engaging in forced labor, sex 
trafficking, illegal drug manufacturing and distribution, and other activities 
that destabilize such countries. And, because of the poor documentation 
practices and corrupt governments in these countries, there can be little 
assurance that the foreign nationals from these countries who seek to come 
to America on immigrant or nonimmigrant visas are not bringing these 
criminal enterprises with them to the United States. 
According to United States law enforcement reporting, foreign nationals 
from countries named in this proclamation have been involved with crimes 
that include murder, terrorism, embezzling public funds, human smuggling, 
human trafficking, and other criminal activity. Many of these countries 
are ranked in the top third of countries for criminality, and widely unreliable 
foreign civil documents and lack of authoritative criminal information make 
it extremely difficult for United States screening and vetting authorities 
to assess prior criminal activity and other grounds of inadmissibility. 
Finally, some of these countries have offered Citizenship by Investment 
(CBI) without residency, which poses challenges for screening and vetting 
purposes. As an example, a foreign national from a country that is subject 
to travel restrictions could purchase CBI from a second country that is 
not subject to travel restrictions, obtain a passport in the citizenship of 
that second country, and subsequently apply for a United States visa for 
travel to the United States, thus evading the travel restrictions on his or 
her first country. Additionally, United States law enforcement and the Depart-
ment of State have found that, historically, CBI programs have been suscep-
tible to several risks. These risks include allowing an individual to conceal 
his or her identity and assets to circumvent travel restrictions or financial 
or banking restrictions.

lotter on DSK11XQN23PROD with FR_PREZDOC359719 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 242 / Friday, December 19, 2025 / Presidential Documents Foreign nationals from the countries described above have also exploited 
the historic generosity of the United States and violated our Nation’s immigra-
tion laws by not adhering to the terms of their nonimmigrant or immigrant 
visas. As cited in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Entry/Exit 
Overstay Report, foreign nationals from many countries have high non-
immigrant visa overstay rates. These visa overstays and other abuses fla-
grantly violate United States immigration laws, despite generous incentives 
offered by my Administration—for example, the ability to self-deport using 
the CBP Home app. To faithfully uphold United States immigration law, 
the flow of foreigners from countries with high overstay rates or significant 
fraud must stop. 
In addition, the implementation of Proclamation 10949 counsels narrowing 
the categorical exceptions described in that proclamation to prevent exploi-
tation by foreign nationals. For example, immigrant visas for family members 
of individuals in the United States will no longer be a broad categorical 
exception. As described above, the countries to which this proclamation 
applies have persistent, chronic vetting deficiencies that impede conclusive 
admissibility determinations and that are readily exploitable to threaten 
United States national security and public safety. These deficiencies include 
poor civil documentation and recordkeeping practices, widespread corruption 
and fraud, unreliable or inaccessible criminal records, and unreliable govern-
ment travel documents. These pervasive risks concerning nationals from 
the covered countries apply with at least equal force to family-based visa 
applications—which comprise most of the immigrant visa applications from 
such countries—and potentially with even greater force. Familial ties can 
serve—and, in the past, have in fact served, based on concrete information 
provided by United States law enforcement and the Department of State— 
as unique vectors for fraudulent, criminal, or even terrorist activity through 
means such as the domestic or international financing of such activity. 
Broadly excepting most immigrant visa applicants from the countries whose 
risks and deficiencies most gravely threaten America is inconsistent with 
protecting our national security and with the purpose of driving greater 
cooperation and vetting improvements by these specific countries. This is 
particularly true in light of the large numbers of individuals granted United 
States immigration status during the prior administration without sufficient 
documentation and vetting mechanisms in place, whose family members 
might take advantage of such an exception, just as criminals have taken 
advantage of family-based visas in the past. Accordingly, I have determined 
that the risks from the classes of aliens covered by this proclamation cannot 
be satisfactorily mitigated absent resolution of the predominating country- 
specific concerns, and any extraordinary cases can be appropriately addressed 
through the national-interest exceptions provided for in this proclamation 
and Proclamation 10949. 
As a result of these reviews and considerations, I have decided—as described 
in sections 2 and 3 of this proclamation—to continue to impose and modify 
the limitations set forth in sections 2 and 3 of Proclamation 10949 on 
the entry into the United States by certain classes of foreign nationals. 
Also, I have decided—as described in sections 4 and 5 of this proclamation— 
to impose the limitations set forth below on the entry into the United 
States by certain other classes of foreign nationals. 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States 
of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215(a) 
of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), and section 301 of title 3, United 
States Code, hereby find that, absent the measures set forth in this proclama-
tion, the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of persons 
described in sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this proclamation would be detrimental 
to the interests of the United States, and that their entry should be subject 
to certain restrictions, limitations, and exceptions. I therefore hereby proclaim 
the following:

public safety threats. Screening and vetting protocols and procedures associ-
ated with visa adjudications and other immigration processes play a critical 
role in implementing that policy. These protocols and procedures enhance 
our ability to detect foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support 
acts of terrorism, or otherwise pose a safety threat, and they aid our efforts 
to prevent such foreign nationals from entering the United States. 
(b) Identity-management and information-sharing standards and practices 
of foreign governments impact the effectiveness of the screening and vetting 
protocols and procedures of the United States. Foreign governments manage 
the identity and travel documents of their nationals and residents. They 
also control the circumstances under which they provide information about 
their nationals and residents to other governments, including information 
about known and suspected terrorists and criminals. 
It is, therefore, the policy of the United States to take all necessary and 
appropriate steps to encourage foreign governments to improve their identity- 
management and information-sharing protocols and procedures and to regu-
larly share their identity and threat information with the screening and 
vetting systems of the United States. 
(c) Proclamation 10949 directed the United States Government to fully 
restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the following 12 countries: Afghani-
stan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, 
Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The proclamation directed the 
United States Government to partially restrict and limit the entry of nationals 
of the following 7 countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, 
Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Additionally, the proclamation directed the 
Secretary of State, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary 
of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, to imme-
diately engage each of the countries identified in the proclamation on meas-
ures that must be taken to comply with United States screening, vetting, 
immigration, and security requirements. 
(d) Proclamation 10949 directed the Secretary of State, in consultation 
with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the 
Director of National Intelligence, to submit a report to the President, through 
the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, describing his assess-
ment and recommending whether any suspensions and limitations imposed 
by the proclamation should be continued, terminated, modified, or supple-
mented. 
(e) The Secretary of State, with the Assistant to the President for Homeland 
Security, presented the report described in subsection (d) of this section, 
recommending that entry restrictions and limitations continue to apply to 
foreign nationals of several countries. The report also identified additional 
countries for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as 
to warrant a full or partial suspension of admission. These recommendations 
follow the engagement with foreign countries that I directed in Proclamation 
10949. 
(f) In evaluating the recommendations from the Secretary of State and 
determining whether and to what extent to impose, or continue to impose, 
restrictions for each country, I consulted with the Secretary of State, the 
Secretary of War, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
the Director of National Intelligence, appropriate Assistants to the President, 
and the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. I considered foreign 
policy, national security, and counterterrorism goals. I further considered 
various factors, including each country’s screening and vetting capabilities, 
information-sharing policies, and country-specific risk factors, including 
whether each country has a significant terrorist presence within its territory, 
its visa-overstay rate, and its cooperation with accepting back its removable 
nationals. Each of these factors, including visa-overstay rates, was just one 
of the factors considered in making the determinations in this proclamation, 
and the determinations in this proclamation are based on the totality of

factors. 
I also considered the different risks posed by aliens admitted on immigrant 
visas and those admitted on nonimmigrant visas. Persons admitted on immi-
grant visas are, or can become, lawful permanent residents of the United 
States. Such persons admitted on immigrant visas may present national 
security or public safety concerns that may be distinct from those admitted 
as nonimmigrants. The United States affords lawful permanent residents 
more enduring rights than it does to nonimmigrants. Lawful permanent 
residents are more difficult to remove than nonimmigrants, even after national 
security or public safety concerns arise, which increases the costs and aggra-
vates the dangers of errors associated with admitting such individuals. And 
although immigrants are generally subject to more extensive vetting than 
nonimmigrants, such vetting is far less reliable when the country from 
which someone seeks to emigrate maintains inadequate identity-management 
or information-sharing policies or otherwise poses risks to the national secu-
rity or public safety of the United States. 
I reviewed these factors and assessed these goals, with a particular focus 
on crafting country-specific restrictions. This approach was designed to en-
courage cooperation with the relevant countries in recognition of each coun-
try’s unique circumstances. The restrictions and limitations imposed by 
this proclamation are, in my judgment, necessary to prevent the entry or 
admission of foreign nationals about whom the United States Government 
lacks sufficient information to assess the risks they pose to the United 
States. The restrictions and limitations imposed by this proclamation are 
necessary: to garner cooperation from foreign governments, including as 
to reducing overstay rates of their nationals; enforce our immigration laws; 
and advance other important foreign policy, national security, and counterter-
rorism objectives. Under the current circumstances, without the restrictions 
and limitations imposed in this proclamation, the entry or admission of 
such foreign nationals is detrimental to the national interest. 
(g) After reviewing the report described in subsection (d) of this section, 
and after accounting for the foreign policy, national security, and counterter-
rorism objectives of the United States, I have determined to continue to 
fully restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the following 12 countries: 
Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, 
Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. These restrictions distinguish 
between, but apply to both, the entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants. 
(h) After reviewing the report described in subsection (d) of this section, 
and after accounting for the foreign policy, national security, and counterter-
rorism objectives of the United States, I have determined to fully restrict 
and limit the entry of nationals of 7 additional countries: Burkina Faso, 
Laos, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, and Syria. These restrictions 
distinguish between, but apply to both, the entry of immigrants and non-
immigrants. I have also determined to fully restrict and limit the entry 
of individuals using travel documents issued or endorsed by the Palestinian 
Authority (PA). 
(i) After reviewing the report described in subsection (d) of this section, 
and after accounting for the foreign policy, national security, and counterter-
rorism objectives of the United States, I have determined to continue to 
partially restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the following 4 countries: 
Burundi, Cuba, Togo, and Venezuela. I have also decided to modify the 
partial restriction and limitation on the entry of nationals of Turkmenistan. 
These restrictions distinguish between, but apply to both, the entry of immi-
grants and nonimmigrants. 
(j) After reviewing the report described in subsection (d) of this section, 
and after accounting for the foreign policy, national security, and counterter-

Zimbabwe. These restrictions distinguish between, but apply to both, the 
entry of immigrants and nonimmigrants. 
(k) Sections 4 and 5 of this proclamation describe some of the identity- 
management and information-sharing inadequacies that led me to impose, 
or continue to impose, the restrictions described in this proclamation. These 
inadequacies are sufficient to justify my finding that unrestricted entry of 
nationals from the named countries would be detrimental to the interests 
of the United States. Publicly disclosing additional details on which I relied 
in making these determinations, however, would cause serious damage to 
the national security of the United States, and many such details are classi-
fied. 
Sec. 2. Continued Full Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Identified Concern. The entry into the United States of nationals of the 
following countries continues to be suspended and limited as set forth 
in Proclamation 10949 and herein, subject to the categorical exceptions

to the Fiscal Year 2024, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Entry/ 
Exit Overstay Report (‘‘Overstay Report’’), Burkina Faso had a B–1/B– 
2 visa overstay rate of 9.16 percent and a student (F), vocational (M), 
and exchange visitor (J) visa overstay rate of 22.95 percent. Additionally, 
Burkina Faso has historically refused to accept back its removable nation-
als. 
(ii) The entry into the United States of nationals of Burkina Faso as 
immigrants and as nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended.

rate of 28.34 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 11.41 
percent. According to the Fiscal Year 2023, Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) Entry/Exit Overstay Report (‘‘2023 Overstay Report’’), Laos 
had a B–1/B–2 visa overstay rate of 34.77 percent and an F, M, and 
J visa overstay rate of 6.49 percent. Additionally, Laos has historically 
failed to accept back its removable nationals. 
(ii) The entry into the United States of nationals of Laos as immigrants 
and as nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended. 
(c) Mali 
(i) According to the Department of State, armed conflict between the 
Malian government and armed groups is common throughout the country. 
Terrorist organizations operate freely in certain areas of Mali. 
(ii) The entry into the United States of nationals of Mali as immigrants 
and as nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended. 
(d) Niger 
(i) According to the Department of State, terrorists and their supporters 
are active in planning kidnappings in Niger, and they may attack anywhere 
in the country. According to the Overstay Report, Niger had a B–1/B– 
2 visa overstay rate of 13.41 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay 
rate of 16.46 percent. 
(ii) The entry into the United States of nationals of Niger as immigrants

of 35.83 percent. According to the 2023 Overstay Report, Sierra Leone 
had a B–1/B–2 visa overstay rate of 15.43 percent and an F, M, and

26.09 percent. Additionally, South Sudan has historically failed to accept 
back its removable nationals. 
(ii) The entry into the United States of nationals of South Sudan as 
immigrants and as nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended. 
(g) Syria 
(i) Syria is emerging from a protracted period of civil unrest and internal 
strife. While the country is working to address its security challenges 
in close coordination with the United States, Syria still lacks an adequate 
central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and does not 
have appropriate screening and vetting measures. According to the Overstay 
Report, Syria had a B–1/B–2 visa overstay rate of 7.09 percent and a 
F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 9.34 percent. 
(ii) The entry into the United States of nationals of Syria as immigrants 
and nonimmigrants is hereby fully suspended. 
(h) Palestinian Authority Documents 
(i) Several United States-designated terrorist groups operate actively in 
the West Bank or Gaza Strip and have murdered American citizens. Also, 
the recent war in these areas likely resulted in compromised vetting and 
screening abilities. In light of these factors, and considering the weak 
or nonexistent control exercised over these areas by the PA, individuals 
attempting to travel on PA-issued or endorsed travel documents cannot 
currently be properly vetted and approved for entry into the United States.
