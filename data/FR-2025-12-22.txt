Policy Statement on Section 9(13) of 
the Federal Reserve Act 
AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 
ACTION: Final rule; rescission of a policy statement; issuance of a policy 
statement. 
SUMMARY: The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is 
rescinding its 2023 policy statement 
interpreting section 9(13) of the Federal 
Reserve Act (FRA) (2023 Policy 
Statement), which set out a presumption 
for how the Board would exercise its 
authority under that provision and 
elaborated on supervisory expectations 
at that time related to ‘‘novel and 
unprecedented’’ activities. The Board is 
also withdrawing from the record the 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATIONthat 
accompanied the 2023 Policy Statement, 
which discussed specific crypto-asset 
activities. The Board is replacing the 
2023 Policy Statement with a new 
policy statement on section 9(13) of the 
FRA, which is designed to facilitate 
innovation by state member banks in a 
manner that is consistent with bank 
safety and soundness and preserving the 
stability of the U.S. financial system. 
The new policy statement also provides 
guidance to uninsured state member 
banks and uninsured state-chartered 
bank applicants for membership who 
may seek to engage in activities as 
principal that are not permissible for 
insured state member banks. 
DATES: This final rule and policy statement is effective on December 22, 
2025.

consistent with section 24 of the Federal

(FDIC)] has determined that the activity 
would pose no significant risk to the 
Deposit Insurance Fund; and (B) the 
State bank is, and continues to be, in 
compliance with applicable capital 
standards prescribed by the appropriate 
Federal banking agency.’’

In 2023, the 
Board issued a policy statement 
interpreting section 9(13) (2023 Policy 
Statement), setting out a presumption 
for how the Board intended to use its 
authority under the provision and 
elaborating on supervisory expectations 
at that time regarding ‘‘novel and 
unprecedented’’ activities.
3
 
At this time, the Board has concluded 
that it is appropriate to rescind the 2023 
Policy Statement and replace it with a 
new policy statement (2025 Policy 
Statement) describing the Board’s 
intention to interpret section 9(13) of 
the FRA in a manner designed to 
facilitate innovation by state member 
banks, consistent with bank safety and 
soundness and preserving the stability 
of the U.S. financial system. The Board 
is also withdrawing from the record 
portions of the 
SUPPLEMENTARY 
INFORMATION(2023 Preamble) discussing 
specific crypto-asset activities. The 2025 
Policy Statement (i) articulates the 
Board’s commitment to the principle of 
‘‘same activity, same risks, same 
regulation’’ and the reciprocal principle 
of ‘‘different activity, different risks, 
different regulation’’ in a manner 
designed to facilitate innovation by state 
member banks, and (ii) provides further 
guidance to uninsured state member 
banks and uninsured state-chartered 
bank applicants for membership who 
may seek to engage in activities as 
principal that are not permissible for 
insured state member banks. 
II. Rescission of the 2023 Policy 
Statement 
In January 2023, the Board published 
the 2023 Policy Statement,
4
which set 
out a rebuttable presumption that the 
Board would exercise its discretion 
under section 9(13) of the FRA to limit 
the authority of state member banks to 
engage as principal in only those 
activities that are permissible for 
national banks—in each case, subject to 
the terms, conditions, and limitations 
placed on national banks with respect to 
the activity—unless those activities are 
permissible for state-chartered banks by 
federal statute or under part 362 of the 
FDIC’s regulations. The 2023 Policy 
Statement also (i) reiterated to state 
member banks that legal permissibility 
is a necessary, but not sufficient, 
condition to establish that a state 
member bank may engage in a particular 
activity; (ii) reminded state member 
banks that they must at all times 
conduct their business and exercise 
their powers with due regard to safety 
and soundness, including by having in 
place appropriate internal controls and 
information systems; and (iii) 
highlighted particular risks associated 
with, and supervisory expectations for, 
‘‘novel and unprecedented’’ activities. 
Furthermore, the 2023 Preamble 
discussed how the 2023 Policy 
Statement would presumptively apply 
to particular sets of facts related to 
certain crypto-asset activities at the 
time. 
The 2023 Policy Statement was part of 
a series of Board or Board staff issuances 
in 2022 and 2023 related to crypto-asset 
activities and supervisory expectations 
for such activities. Recently, those

Uninsured state member banks must receive 
approval from the Board for permission to conduct 
an activity as principal, if the FDIC has permitted 
the activity only for specific insured state bank(s). 
In such case, the fact that the FDIC has approved 
at least one insured state-chartered bank to engage 
in the activity would be highly pertinent to the 
Board’s analysis. 
issuances have been rescinded or 
withdrawn.
5
The Board believes these 
statements are no longer appropriate 
given its evolving understanding of the 
risks of the crypto-asset sector and its 
desire to facilitate innovation in a 
manner consistent with safety and 
soundness and preserving the stability 
of the U.S. financial system. Similarly, 
at this time, the Board has determined 
it should rescind the 2023 Policy 
Statement in its entirety, including 
related guidance in the 2023 Preamble. 
II. 2025 Policy Statement 
The Board continues to believe it is 
beneficial to provide transparency to the 
public regarding its interpretation of 
section 9(13) of the FRA, as well as how 
it intends to use its authority under the 
provision. Therefore, the Board is 
replacing its 2023 Policy Statement with 
the 2025 Policy Statement. 
A. Legal Authority 
Under section 9(13) of the Act, the 
Board ‘‘may limit the activities of State 
member banks and subsidiaries of State 
member banks in a manner consistent 
with section 24 of the [FDIA].’’
6
Section 
24 prohibits an insured State bank from 
engaging ‘‘as principal in any type of 
activity that is not permissible for a 
national bank unless—(A) the [FDIC] 
has determined that the activity would 
pose no significant risk to the Deposit 
Insurance Fund; and (B) the State bank 
is, and continues to be, in compliance 
with applicable capital standards 
prescribed by the appropriate Federal 
banking agency.’’
7
 
The National Bank Act enumerates 
certain powers that national banks may 
exercise and authorizes national banks 
to exercise ‘‘all such incidental powers 
as shall be necessary to carry on the 
business of banking.’’
8
Section 7.1000 
of the OCC’s regulations identifies the 
criteria that the OCC uses to determine 
whether an activity is authorized as part 
of, or incidental to, the business of 
banking under 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh).
9
If 
a national bank has not been authorized 
by federal law, including the National 
Bank Act, to engage in an activity, then 
national banks are not permitted to 
engage in such activity. 
B. Application 
The 2025 Policy Statement applies to 
insured and uninsured state member 
banks. Insured state member banks, 
however, are already required by section 
24 of the FDIA and part 362 of the 
FDIC’s regulations to seek approval from 
the FDIC when seeking to conduct an 
activity as principal that is not 
permissible for national banks. As 
established under those provisions, 
insured state member banks may not 
engage as principal in any type of 
activity that is not permissible for a 
national bank unless—(i) the FDIC has 
determined that the activity would pose 
no significant risk to the Deposit 
Insurance Fund; and (ii) the insured 
state member bank is, and continues to 
be, in compliance with applicable 
capital standards prescribed by the 
Board.
10
 
If an activity is authorized for national 
banks to conduct as principal, it is 
generally permissible for insured state 
member banks to conduct as principal, 
provided the activity is permitted under 
relevant state law and the bank adheres 
to the terms, conditions, and limitations 
placed on national banks by the OCC 
with respect to the activity. 
Furthermore, if the FDIC, by rule, 
permits insured state-chartered banks to 
engage in the activity as principal even 
if that activity is not permissible for 
national banks, it is generally 
permissible for insured state member 
banks to engage in the activity as 
principal, provided the activity is 
permitted under state law. If there is no 
authority for an insured state-chartered 
bank to engage in a particular activity as 
principal under federal statute or part 
362 of the FDIC’s regulations, an 
insured state member bank should 
apply to the FDIC for permission to 
engage in the activity as principal under 
part 362 of the FDIC’s regulations.
11
 
Furthermore, if the FDIC has permitted 
only specific insured state-chartered 
bank(s) to engage in the activity as 
principal, other insured state-chartered 
banks must similarly apply to the FDIC 
for specific permission. 
An uninsured state member bank may 
not engage in any activity as principal 
that is not authorized for national banks 
or insured state-chartered banks, unless 
the Board has provided otherwise by 
regulation, order, or other means, or the 
uninsured state member bank has 
received the permission of the Board 
under section 208.3(d)(2) of the Board’s 
Regulation H.
12
Under that provision, a 
state member bank may not, without the 
permission of the Board, change the 
general character of its business or the 
scope of the corporate powers it 
exercised at the time of its admission to 
membership.
13
To the extent firms have 
inquiries regarding legal permissibility, 
the Board will engage with the FDIC and 
OCC as appropriate, consistent with this 
policy statement. 
In determining whether to grant an 
uninsured state member bank or an 
uninsured state-chartered bank 
applicant for membership permission to 
engage in an activity as principal that is 
not permissible for insured state 
member banks, the Board, under the 
2025 Policy Statement, will consider 
whether the uninsured state member 
bank would be capable of engaging in 
such activity in a manner that is 
consistent with bank safety and 
soundness and preserving the stability 
of the U.S. financial system. The Board 
may consider (i) the regulatory 
framework to which the uninsured state 
member bank is subject; (ii) the risks 
presented by the proposed activities and 
the bank’s planned internal controls 
framework to address such risks; and 
(iii) how the institution would mitigate 
the risks otherwise addressed by deposit 
insurance and FDIC resolution. Among 
other things, the Board may consider 
whether the uninsured state member 
bank has a financial profile that is at 
least as effective as deposit insurance in 
minimizing the risk of deposit runs and 
contagion. This may, for example, be 
demonstrated if the uninsured state 
member bank has (i) a sufficient amount 
of total loss-absorbing capacity 
(consisting of capital and long-term 
debt) that is subordinate to the bank’s 
deposits and other short-term liabilities; 
or (ii) high-quality liquid assets equal to 
100 percent of the bank’s demand 
deposits and other short-term liabilities. 
The Board may also consider whether 
the uninsured state member bank has a 
resolution plan that demonstrates how 
the bank could be recapitalized or 
wound down in an orderly manner if it 
fails to remain a viable going concern.

See 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(2). III. Regulatory Analyses 
This rule clarifies how the Board 
interprets and intends to exercise its 
discretion under section 9(13) of the 
Act. It is not itself binding on state 
member banks. Accordingly, the 
provisions of the Administrative 
Procedure Act (APA) regarding notice of 
proposed rulemaking and opportunity 
for public participation are not 
applicable.
14
 
Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required to be issued, or 
has been issued, in connection with this 
rule, it is not a ‘‘rule’’ for purposes of 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and that 
act, therefore, does not apply.
15
 
In accordance with the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA),
16
the 
Board may not conduct or sponsor, and 
a respondent is not required to respond 
to, an information collection unless it 
displays a currently valid Office of 
Management and Budget control 
number. The Board has reviewed the 
rule and has determined that it contains 
no collections of information as defined 
in the PRA. 
Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach- 
Bliley Act
17
requires the federal 
banking agencies to use plain language 
in all proposed and final rules 
published after January 1, 2000. The 
Board has sought to present this rule in 
a simple and straightforward manner. 
The APA does not require the Board 
to delay the effective date of the rule.
18
 
Accordingly, the rule is effective 
December 22, 2025.

of Federal Regulations as follows:

Subpart J—Interpretations 
2. Revise § 208.112 to read as follows: 
§ 208.112. Policy statement on section 
9(13) of the Federal Reserve Act. 
(a) Under section 9(13) of the Federal 
Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 330), a State 
member bank may exercise all corporate 
powers granted it by the State in which 
it was created except that the Board may 
limit the activities of State member 
banks and subsidiaries of State member 
banks in a manner consistent with 
section 24 of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act.’’ The Board interprets 
this provision as vesting in the Board 
the authority to prohibit or otherwise 
restrict State member banks and their 
subsidiaries from engaging as principal 
in any activity (including acquiring or 
retaining any investment) that is not 
permissible for a national bank, unless 
the activity is permissible for State- 
chartered banks by Federal statute or 
under section 24(a) of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act. 
(b) The Board generally believes that 
the same activity, presenting the same 
risks, should be subject to the same 
regulatory framework, and that a 
different activity, presenting different 
risks, should be subject to a different 
regulatory framework. Consistent with 
this principle, the Board intends to 
interpret section 9(13) of the Federal 
Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 330) to facilitate 
innovation by insured and uninsured 
State member banks in a manner 
consistent with safety and soundness of 
State member banks and preserving the 
stability of the U.S. financial system. 
(c) In alignment with this principle, 
the Board generally presumes that it 
will exercise its discretion under section 
9(13) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 
U.S.C. 330) to limit the authority of 
insured State member banks and their 
subsidiaries to engage in any activity as 
principal to those activities that are 
permissible for national banks—in each 
case, subject to the terms, conditions, 
and limitations placed on national 
banks with respect to the activity— 
unless those activities are permissible 
for insured State-chartered banks under 
section 24 of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act. 
(d) If an activity is authorized for 
national banks to conduct as principal, 
it is generally permissible for State 
member banks to conduct as principal, 
provided that it is permitted under 
relevant State law and the bank adheres 
to the terms, conditions, and limitations 
placed on national banks by the OCC 
with respect to the activity. 
(e) If the FDIC, by rule, permits 
insured State-chartered banks to engage 
in any activity as principal under 
section 24 of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act that is not permissible for 
national banks, it is generally 
permissible for State member banks to 
engage in that activity, provided it is 
permitted under applicable State law. If 
there is no authority for an insured 
State-chartered bank to engage in a 
particular activity as principal under 
Federal statute or part 362 of the FDIC’s 
regulations, that activity must be 
authorized for insured depository 
institutions by the FDIC under section 
24 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 
(12 U.S.C. 1831a) and the insured State 
member bank must be in compliance 
with applicable capital requirements 
issued by the Board. 
(f) An uninsured State member bank 
may not engage in any activity as 
principal that is not authorized for 
national banks or insured State- 
chartered banks, unless the Board has 
provided otherwise by regulation, order, 
or other means, or the uninsured State 
member bank has received the 
permission of the Board under 
§ 208.3(d)(2) of the Board’s Regulation 
H. In determining whether to grant an 
uninsured state member bank or an 
uninsured State-chartered bank 
applicant for membership permission to 
engage in an activity as principal that is 
not permissible for insured State 
member banks, the Board will consider 
whether the uninsured State member 
bank would be capable of engaging in 
such activity in a safe and sound 
manner and in a manner that is 
consistent with preserving the stability 
of the U.S. financial system. 
By order of the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System. 
Benjamin W. McDonough, 
Deputy Secretary of the Board.

AGENCY: Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor. 
ACTION: Final rule; rescission of regulations. 
SUMMARY: On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive 
order rescinding certain Executive 
orders and actions, which revoked an 
Executive order concerning 
nondisplacement of qualified workers 
under Federal service contracts and 
directed the heads of each agency to 
take immediate steps to effectuate the 
revocations listed. In accordance with 
this directive, the Department of Labor 
is issuing a final rule to rescind the 
regulations on nondisplacement of 
qualified workers under service 
contracts, which were promulgated 
solely pursuant to the authority 
provided by the revoked Executive 
order. 
DATES: This rule is effective December 22, 2025.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Executive Summary 
On January 20, 2025, President Trump 
issued Executive Order 14148, ‘‘Initial 
Rescissions of Harmful Executive 
Orders and Actions’’ (90 FR 8237 (Jan. 
28, 2025)). Executive Order 14148 
directs the heads of each agency to take 
immediate steps to effectuate the 
revocations listed in the Executive 
Order, including Executive Order 14055 
of November 18, 2021, 
‘‘Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers 
Under Service Contracts’’ (86 FR 66397 
(Nov. 23, 2021)). Accordingly, the 
Department of Labor (Department) 
issues this final rule rescinding 29 CFR 
part 9 as these regulations implement 
Executive Order 14055. 
II. Background 
Executive Order 14055 provided that 
qualified employees on a Federal 
service contract be given the right of 
first refusal of employment with a 
successor contractor if they would 
otherwise lose their jobs as a result of 
expiration of the contract. The 
implementing regulations, 29 CFR part 
9, were promulgated solely in 
accordance with the terms of Executive 
Order 14055 and were published in the 
Federal Register on December 14, 2023 
(88 FR 86736). 
On January 20, 2025, President Trump 
issued Executive Order 14148, Initial 
Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders 
and Actions. Executive Order 14148 
directs the heads of each agency to take 
immediate steps to effectuate the 
revocations listed in the Executive 
Order, including Executive Order 
14055. 
III. Procedural Matters 
Section 553(b)(B) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (APA) 
provides that an agency is not required 
to publish a notice of proposed 
rulemaking in the Federal Register and 
solicit public comments when the 
agency has good cause to find that doing 
so would be ‘‘impracticable, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public 
interest.’’ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). Section 
553(d) of the APA further provides that 
substantive rules should take effect not 
less than 30 days after the date they are 
published in the Federal Register unless 
‘‘otherwise provided by the agency for 
good cause found[.]’’ 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). 
Since the sole authority for the 
regulations at 29 CFR part 9 no longer 
exists, the Department finds that good 
cause exists to dispense with public 
notice-and-comment rulemaking 
procedures in this final rule because 
such procedures are unnecessary. 
Executive Order 14055 was the sole 
authority for those regulations. Further, 
the express purpose of the regulations 
was to administer and implement that 
executive order (29 CFR 9.1(a)). With 
the rescission of Executive Order 14055, 
the nondisplacement regulations are 
ultra vires and serve no purpose. No 
public comment could affect those 
underlying considerations and therefore 
such public process is unnecessary. See 
EME Homer City Generation, L.P. v. 
E.P.A., 795 F.3d 118, 134 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (upholding agency’s invocation of 
the ‘‘unnecessary’’ prong where 
‘‘commentators could not have said 
anything during a notice and comment 
period that would have changed’’ the 
need to issue the rule in response to a 
court order). For the same reason, the 
Department similarly finds good cause 
under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) to make this 
final rule immediately effective. 
Furthermore, this final rule is 
considered a deregulatory action for the 
purposes of Executive Order 14192, 
Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation, 90 FR 9065. Details on reduced burdens and cost savings of this 
final rule can be found in the rule’s 
economic analysis. 
IV. Paperwork Reduction Act 
The information collection 
requirements contained in the 
regulations at 29 CFR part 9 were 
previously approved by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 
(Pub. L. 96–511) and assigned OMB 
Control Number 1235–0033. In light of 
the rescission of these regulations, the 
Department has submitted a request to 
OMB to discontinue the information 
collection under OMB control number 
1235–0033. 
V. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory 
Planning and Review; Executive Order 
13563, Improved Regulation and 
Regulatory Review 
Under Executive Order 12866, OMB’s 
Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs (OIRA) determines whether a 
regulatory action is significant and, 
therefore, subject to the requirements of 
the Executive Order and OMB review.
1
 
Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 
defines a ‘‘significant regulatory action’’ 
as a regulatory action that is likely to 
result in a rule that may: (1) have an 
annual effect on the economy of $100 
million or more, or adversely affect in 
a material way a sector of the economy, 
productivity, competition, jobs, the 
environment, public health or safety, or 
state, local, or tribal governments or 
communities (also referred to as 
economically significant); (2) create 
serious inconsistency or otherwise 
interfere with an action taken or 
planned by another agency; (3) 
materially alter the budgetary impact of 
entitlements, grants, user fees or loan

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with RULES59735 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Rules and Regulations 2
See 88 FR 86736 (Dec. 14, 2023). 3
Because the rule never became applicable, WHD 
does not believe serious reliance interests are 
implicated by this action. 
4
The Department recognizes that some SCA- 
covered contracts that would be covered by this 
rule are not reflected in USASpending.gov (i.e., they are SCA-covered contracts that are not procuring 
services directly for the Federal Government, 
including certain licenses, permits, cooperative 
agreements, and concessions contracts, such as, for 
example, delegated leases of space on a military 
base from an agency to a contractor whereby the 
contractor operates a barber shop). However, the 
Department estimates that the number of firms 
holding such SCA-covered nonprocurement 
contracts is a small fraction of the number of firms 
identified based on USASpending.gov. 
5
The Department also acknowledges that prime 
contracts that are less than $250,000 and their 
subcontracts would not be covered by this 
regulation, but the Department has not made an 
adjustment for these contracts in the estimation of 
covered contractors. Therefore, this estimate may be 
an overestimate of the number of contractors that 
are actually affected. 
6
The Department estimated the number of prime 
contractors using the 2021 USASpending.gov data and found that there were fewer contractors in 2021 
than in 2019. The number of prime contractors in 
2019 was 85,987 and the number of prime 
contractors in 2021 was 78,347. This finding is in 
line with the Department’s hypothesis that remote 
work for Federal employees could have reduced the 
demand for SCA contractors in 2021. 
7
For example, the Government purchases 
pencils; however, a contract solely to purchase 
pencils is not covered by the SCA and so would not 
be covered by the Executive Order. Contracts for 
goods were identified in the USASpending.gov data if the product or service code begins with a number 
(the code for services begins with a letter). 
8
Contracts covered by DBA were identified in the 
USASpending.gov data where the ‘‘Construction Wage Rate Requirements’’ element for a contract is 
marked ‘‘Y,’’ meaning that the contracting agency 
flagged that the contract is covered by the DBA. 
9
For subcontractors, the Department was unable 
to make restrictions to limit the data to SCA 
contracts because none of the necessary variables 
are available in the USASpending.gov database (i.e., Continued 
programs or the rights and obligations of 
recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel 
legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, the President’s priorities, or 
the principles set forth in the Executive 
Order. OIRA has determined this rule to 
be ‘‘economically significant’’ under 
Executive Order 12866 section 3(f)(1), 
and is therefore subject to review under 
section 6(a)(3)(C) of that order. 
Executive Order 13563 directs 
agencies to, among other things, propose 
or adopt a regulation only upon a 
reasoned determination that its benefits 
justify its costs; that it is tailored to 
impose the least burden on society, 
consistent with obtaining the regulatory 
objectives; and that, in choosing among 
alternative regulatory approaches, the 
agency has selected those approaches 
that maximize net benefits. Executive 
Order 13563 recognizes that some costs 
and benefits are difficult to quantify and 
provides that, when appropriate and 
permitted by law, agencies may 
consider and discuss qualitatively 
values that are difficult or impossible to 
quantify, including equity, human 
dignity, fairness, and distributive 
impacts. The analysis below outlines 
the impacts that the Department 
anticipates may result from this 
rescission and was prepared pursuant to 
the above-mentioned executive orders. 
A. Background 
On December 14, 2023, the 
Department published the 
‘‘Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers 
Under Service Contracts’’ final rule 
(Nondisplacement final rule) 
exclusively to implement Executive 
Order 14055.
2
The rule required that 
contractors and subcontractors 
performing on covered Federal service 
contracts must in good faith offer 
service employees employed under the 
predecessor contract a right of first 
refusal of employment. The order 
applied to contracts that are covered by 
the McNamara-O’Hara Service Contract 
Act (SCA) and are at or above the 
simplified acquisition threshold. 
Because section 11 of Executive Order 
14055 stated that the Executive order 
applied to solicitations issued on or 
after the effective date of the final 
regulations issued by the FAR Council, 
and because the Federal Acquisition 
Regulatory Council (FAR Council) never 
promulgated regulations to implement 
the requirements of Executive Order 
14055 as part of the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR), the Department’s rule 
effectively never became applicable.
3
 
The Department is unaware of any 
solicitations that incorporated the 
provisions outlined by either Executive 
Order 14055 or the Department’s 
implementing regulations at 29 CFR part 
9. The Department expects minimal rule 
familiarization costs from the rescission 
of the rule and provides a qualitative 
discussion of costs that may be avoided 
by rescinding the rule. 
B. Number of Potentially Affected 
Contractor Firms 
To determine the number of firms that 
could potentially be affected by this 
rulemaking, the Department used a 
broad measure of firms that may incur 
regulatory familiarization costs. To 
determine the number of firms that 
could potentially be affected by this 
rulemaking, the Department estimated a 
range of potentially affected firms. The 
more narrowly defined population 
(firms actively holding SCA-covered 
contracts) includes 119,695 firms (Table 
1). The broader population consists of 
those bidding on SCA contracts but 
without active contracts (33,708) as well 
as those considering bidding in the 
future (409,053), for a total of 442,761 
firms. 
1. Firms Currently Holding SCA 
Contracts 
USASpending.gov—the official source 
for spending data for the U.S. 
Government—contains Government 
award data from the Federal 
Procurement Data System Next 
Generation (FPDS–NG), which is the 
system of record for Federal 
procurement data. The Department used 
these data to identify the number of 
firms that currently hold SCA 
contracts.
45
Although more recent data 
are available, the Department used data 
from 2019 to avoid any shifts in the data 
associated with the COVID–19 
pandemic in 2020. Because many 
Federal employees were working 
remotely throughout 2020 and 2021, 
reliance on service contracts for Federal 
buildings may have been reduced 
during those years and may not reflect 
the level of employment on and 
incidence of SCA contracts going 
forward.
6
 
To identify firms with SCA contracts, 
the Department included all firms with 
the ‘‘Labor Standards’’ element equal to 
‘‘Y’’ for any of their contracts, meaning 
that the contracting agency flagged the 
contract as covered by the SCA. 
However, because this flag is often 
listed as ‘‘not applicable’’ and appears at 
times to be reported with error, the 
Department also included some other 
firms. Of the contracts not flagged as 
SCA, the Department excluded (1) those 
for the purchase of goods
7
and (2) those 
covered by the DBA.
8
The Department 
also excluded (1) awards for financial 
assistance such as direct payments, 
loans, and insurance; and (2) contracts 
performed outside the U.S. because SCA 
coverage is limited to the 50 states, the 
District of Columbia, and certain U.S. 
territories. The firms for the remaining 
contracts are included as potentially 
impacted by this rulemaking. 
In 2019, there were approximately 
86,000 unique prime contractors in 
USASpending.gov that fit the parameters discussed above, and the 
Department has used this number as an 
estimate of prime contractors with 
active SCA contracts. However, 
subcontractors are also impacted by this 
rule. The Department examined 5 years 
of USASpending.gov data (2015 through 2019) and identified 33,708 unique 
subcontractors that did not hold 
contracts as prime contractors in 2019.

10
The North American Industry Classification 
System (NAICS) is a method by which Federal 
statistical agencies classify business establishments 
in order to collect, analyze, and publish data about 
certain industries. Each industry is categorized by 
a sequence of codes ranging from 2 digits (most 
aggregated level) to 6 digits (most granular level). 
https://www.census.gov/naics/. 
11
In the data, a NAICS code is assigned to the 
contract and identifies the industry in which the 
contract work is typically performed. If a firm has 
contracts in several NAICS, the Department has 
assigned it to only one NAICS based on the ordering 
of the contracts in the data (this approximates a 
random assignment to one NAICS). 
12
Data released in monthly files. Available at: 
https://www.sam.gov/SAM/pages/public/extracts/ 
samPublicAccessData.jsf. 
13
Entities registering in SAM are asked if they 
wish to bid on contracts. If the firm answers ‘‘yes,’’ 
then they are included as ‘‘All Awards’’ in the 
‘‘Purpose of Registration’’ column in the SAM data. 
The Department included only firms with a value 
of ‘‘Z2,’’ which denotes ‘‘All Awards.’’ 
14
While there are certain circumstances in which 
state and local government entities act as 
contractors that enter into contracts covered by the 
SCA, the number of such entities is minimal and 
including all government entities would result in an 
inappropriate overestimation. 
The Department used 5 years of data for 
the count of subcontractors to 
compensate for lower-tier 
subcontractors that may not be included 
in USASpending.gov. In total, the Department estimates 
119,695 firms currently hold SCA 
contracts and could potentially be 
affected by this rulemaking under the 
narrow definition. Table 1 shows these 
firms by 2-digit NAICS code. 
10 11
 
2. All Potentially Affected Contractors 
The Department also cast a wider net 
to identify other potentially affected 
contractors, both those directly affected 
(i.e., holding contracts) and those that plan to bid on SCA-covered contracts in 
the future. To determine the estimated 
number of firms, the Department 
identified firms registered in the 
General Services Administration’s 
(GSA) System for Award Management 
(SAM) since all entities bidding on 
Federal procurement contracts or 
applying for grants must register in 
SAM. The Department believes that 
firms registered in SAM represent those 
that may be affected if they decide to 
bid on an SCA contract in the future. 
However, it is also possible that some 
firms that are not already registered in 
SAM may be considering bidding on 
SCA-covered contracts, but due to the 
uncertainty about the existence and 
potential number of these firms, no 
additional firm counts were included in 
the Department’s estimate. 
The Department used October 2022 
SAM data and identified 409,053 
registered firms.
12
The Department 
excluded firms with expired 
registrations, firms only applying for 
grants,
13
government entities (such as 
city or county governments),
14
foreign 
organizations, and companies that only 
sell products and do not provide 
services. SAM includes all prime 
contractors and some subcontractors 
(those that are also prime contractors or 
that have otherwise registered in SAM). 
However, the Department is unable to 
determine the number of subcontractors 
that are not in the SAM database. 
Therefore, the Department added the 
subcontractors identified in 
USASpending to the estimate from the 
SAM database. Adding these 33,708 
firms identified in USASpending to the 
number of firms in SAM (409,053) 
results in a total of 442,761 potentially 
affected firms.

17
This includes the median base wage of $30.83 
from the 2021 OEWS plus benefits paid at a rate of 
46 percent of the base wage, as estimated from the 
BLS’s Employer Costs for Employee Compensation 
(ECEC) data, and overhead costs of 17 percent. 
OEWS data available at: https://www.bls.gov/ 
news.release/ocwage.t01.htm. 
18
Because the work of the contracting agency 
may be split among different positions, the 
Department has used the wage of a more senior 
position for the estimate. 
19
The Department has used the 2025 Rest of 
United States salary table to estimate salary 
expenses. See https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/ 
21Tables/html/RUS_h.aspx. 20
See Congressional Budget Office, ‘‘Comparing the Compensation of Federal and Private-Sector 
Employees, 2011 to 2015,’’ April 25, 2017, https:// 
www.cbo.gov/publication/52637. 
C. Costs 
1. Rule Familiarization Costs 
Some covered contractors will choose 
to read and review this rule rescinding 
the Nondisplacement final rule and will 
thus incur direct costs. To estimate 
these ‘‘regulatory familiarization costs,’’ 
three pieces of information must be 
estimated: (1) the number of affected 
firms; (2) a wage level for the employees 
reviewing the rule; and (3) the amount 
of time spent reviewing the rule. 
As discussed above, the Department 
estimates an upper-bound of 442,761 
potentially affected firms.
15
This is 
likely an overestimate as not all of the 
firms that are registered in SAM are 
predecessor contractors or will bid on 
an SCA contract, and because firms that 
are not interested in bidding on an SCA 
contract do not need to review the 
rescission final rule. 
The Department estimates that, on 
average, affected firms will spend an 
average of 19 minutes reviewing this 
rule. The Department assumes that a 
Compensation, Benefits, and Job 
Analysis Specialist (SOC 13–1141) with 
a median hourly wage of $30.83 will 
review this rulemaking. The Department 
also assumes that benefits are paid at a 
rate of 46 percent of the base wage and 
overhead costs are paid at a rate of 17 
percent of the base wage, resulting in an 
hourly rate of $50.25 per hour. Using 
the GDP deflator to inflate this into 2024 
dollars corresponds to a rate of $57.10 
per hour. 
The Department assumes that each 
reviewer will spend 1 minute per page 
reviewing the rule,
16
which is 
equivalent to 19 double-spaced pages at 
the time of publication. Therefore, the 
Department has estimated the 
undiscounted regulatory familiarization 
costs to be $8.01 million ($57.10 per 
hour × (19 minutes ÷ 60) hour × 442,761 contractors). 
The Department believes that this 
average estimate is appropriate as some 
firms will spend more time reviewing 
the rescission, but as discussed above, 
many others will spend less or no time 
reviewing the rescission.
17
The 
Department has included all regulatory 
familiarization costs in Year 1. 
D. Cost Savings 
Because section 11 of Executive Order 
14055 stated that the Executive order 
applied to solicitations issued on or 
after the effective date of the final 
regulations issued by the FAR Council, 
and because the FAR Council never 
promulgated regulations to implement 
Executive Order 14055, the 
requirements of the Nondisplacement 
final rule were effectively never 
applicable to the regulated community. 
The Department is unaware of any 
solicitations that incorporated the 
provisions outlined by either Executive 
Order 14055 or the Department’s 
implementation regulations at 29 CFR 
part 9, so assessing the cost savings of 
the rescission relative to the current 
practice would result in non-monetized 
cost savings. 
1. Implementation Cost Savings 
The Nondisplacement final rule 
included a contract clause provision 
requiring contracting agencies to ensure 
that covered service contracts and 
subcontracts that succeed a contract for 
performance of the same or similar 
work, and solicitations for such 
contracts and subcontracts, include the 
nondisplacement contract clause. In the 
Nondisplacement final rule, the 
Department estimated that it would take 
an average of 30 minutes total for 
contractors to incorporate the contract 
clause into their covered subcontracts. 
With the rescission of the rule, these 
contractor costs to incorporate this 
contract clause into covered 
subcontracts will not be incurred. The 
Nondisplacement final rule also would 
have required that a contractor provide 
notices to affected workers and their 
collective bargaining representatives, if 
any, in writing of an agency’s 
determination to grant an exception to 
the Executive Order 14055 
requirements, and of the opportunity to 
provide information relevant to an 
agency’s location continuity 
determination pursuant to 29 CFR 
9.11(c)(3). Additionally, predecessor 
contractors would have been required to 
provide written notice to service 
employees employed under the contract 
of their possible right to an offer of 
employment on the successor contract. 
Contractors may have also been required 
to retroactively incorporate a contract 
clause into subcontracts when it was not 
initially incorporated. In the 
Nondisplacement final rule, the 
Department estimated that these 
requirements would take an average of 
45 minutes for each contractor. 
For these cost savings estimates, the 
Department used the lower-bound of 
potentially affected firms (119,695), 
because only the firms with a covered 
contract would incur these 
implementation costs. The cost of this 
time is the median loaded wage for a 
Compensation, Benefits, and Job 
Analysis Specialist of $57.10 per hour. 
Therefore, the Department has estimated 
the undiscounted cost savings of these 
requirements to be $8.54 million ($57.10 
per hour × 1.25 hour × 119,695 contractors). This is likely an 
underestimate because many SCA 
contracts last for several years. 
Under the Nondisplacement final 
rule, contracting agencies would also, 
among other things, have been required 
to ensure contractors provide notice to 
employees on predecessor contracts of 
their possible right to an offer of 
employment, and consider whether 
performance of the work in the same 
locality or localities in which a 
predecessor contract is currently being 
performed is reasonably necessary to 
ensure economical and efficient 
provision of services. Contracting 
agencies would also have been required 
to provide the list of employees on the 
predecessor contract to the successor 
contractor, to forward complaints and 
other pertinent information to the 
Department, and to retroactively 
incorporate the contract clause when it 
was not initially incorporated. 
Contracting agencies will not incur 
these costs because of this rescission. 
In the Nondisplacement final rule, the 
Department estimated that it would take 
the contracting agencies an extra 2.5 
hours of work on average on each 
covered contract, and that the work 
would be performed by a GS 14, Step 1 
Federal employee contracting officer, 
with a fully loaded hourly wage of 
$97.04.
18
This includes the median base 
wage of $52.17 from Office of Personnel 
Management salary tables,
19
plus 
benefits paid at a rate of 69 percent of 
the base wage,
20
and overhead costs of 
17 percent. Using the GDP deflator to 
inflate this into 2024 dollars 
corresponds to a rate of $110.26 per 
hour. Using the USASpending data 
mentioned above, the Department

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with RULES59738 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Rules and Regulations estimated that there were 576,122 
contracts. To estimate the share of these 
contracts that are new in a given year, 
the Department has used 20 percent 
(115,224), because the average length of 
an SCA contract is about 5 years. 
Therefore, the estimated undiscounted 
cost savings to contracting agencies is 
$31.76 million ($110.26 per hour × 2.5 hours × 115,224 contracts). 2. Recordkeeping Cost Savings 
The rescinded rule would have 
required a predecessor contractor to, no 
less than 30 calendar days before 
completion of the contractor’s 
performance of services on a contract, 
furnish the contracting officer a list of 
the names of all service employees 
under the contract and its subcontracts 
at that time. This list would have 
needed to include the anniversary dates 
of employment for each service 
employee under the contract and its 
predecessor contracts with either the 
current or predecessor contractors or 
their subcontractors. If changes to the 
workforce were made after the 
submission of this certified list, the rule 
also would have required a contractor to 
furnish the contracting officer with a 
certified list of the names of all service 
employees working under the contract 
and its subcontracts during the last 
month of contract performance not less 
than 10 business days before completion 
of the contract. 
The rule specified the records 
successor contractors would have been 
required to maintain, including copies 
of or documentation of any written or 
oral offers of employment, a copy of any 
written notice that may have been 
distributed, and the names of the 
employees from the predecessor 
contract to whom an offer was made. 
The rule also would have required 
contractors to maintain a copy of any 
record that forms the basis for any 
exclusion or exception claimed, the 
employee list provided to the 
contracting agency, and the employee 
list received from the contracting 
agency. 
The Department estimates that the 
extra time associated with keeping and 
providing these records, including the 
list of employees, to be an average of 1 
hour per firm per year, and that the 
work will be completed by a 
Compensation, Benefits, and Job 
Analysis Specialist, at a rate of $50.25 
per hour. Using the GDP deflator to 
inflate this into 2024 dollars 
corresponds to a rate of $57.10 per hour. 
The estimated undiscounted cost 
savings from eliminating the 
recordkeeping requirement is $6.83 
million ($57.10 per hour × 1 hour × 119,695). 
3. Displacement of Successor Contractor 
Employees 
There may be some limited cases of 
cost savings when a successor 
contractor has existing employees that 
they planned to assign to a newly- 
awarded contract, but the requirement 
to offer employment to predecessor 
contract workers might make their 
existing employees redundant. In this 
situation, if the successor contractor 
truly could not find another position for 
the employee on the new contract or on 
any of their other existing projects, the 
continued employment of a predecessor 
contract worker could be offset by the 
successor contract worker being laid off. 
The rescission of the rule may yield 
some additional cost savings to 
successor contractors in these cases. 
E. Summary of Costs and Cost Savings 
Costs and cost savings in Year 1 
consist of $8.01 million in undiscounted 
rule rescission familiarization costs, 
$40.30 million in implementation cost 
savings ($8.54 million for contractors 
and $31.76 million for contracting 
agencies), and $6.83 million in 
recordkeeping cost savings. Therefore, 
the total Year 1 undiscounted net cost 
savings of the are $39.12 million. 
Average annualized net cost savings 
over 10 years are $11.13 million using 
a 7 percent discount rate. 
F. Congressional Review Act 
Before a rule can take effect, 5 U.S.C. 
801, the Congressional Review Act 
(CRA) requires agencies to submit the 
rule and a report indicating whether it 
is a major rule to Congress and the 
Comptroller General. This final rule 
meets the criteria at 5 U.S.C. 804(2)(a) 
under the CRA because the revocation 
of 29 CFR part 9 is likely to have an 
annual effect on the economy of 
$100,000,000 or more. However, this 
final rule is not subject to the CRA’s 
general 60-day delayed effective date 
requirement, see 5 U.S.C. 801(a)(3), because the Department has determined 
that notice-and-comment rulemaking is 
unnecessary, for the reasons explained 
earlier. See 5 U.S.C. 808(2). VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act and 
Small Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 
(RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., as amended 
by the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, 
Public Law 104–121 (March 29, 1996), 
requires Federal agencies engaged in 
rulemaking to consider the impact of 
their rules on small entities, consider 
alternatives to minimize that impact, 
and solicit public comment on their 
analyses. The RFA requires an 
assessment of the impact of a regulation 
on a wide range of small entities, 
including small businesses, not-for- 
profit organizations, and small 
governmental jurisdictions. Agencies 
must perform a review to determine 
whether a proposed or final rule would 
have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities. 5 
U.S.C. 603, 604. 
A. Estimating the Number of Small 
Businesses Affected by the Rulemaking 
In order to determine the number of 
small businesses that will be affected by 
the rulemaking, the Department 
followed the same methodology laid out 
in section V.B.2. of the economic 
analysis. For the data from 
USASpending.gov, the business determination was based on the 
inclusion of ‘‘small’’ or ‘‘SBA’’ in the 
business type. For GSA’s System for 
Award Management (SAM) for October 
2022, if a company qualified as a small 
business in any reported NAICS, they 
were classified as ‘‘small.’’ Table 3 
shows the range of potentially affected 
small firms by industry. The total 
number of potentially affected small 
firms ranges from 74,097 to 329,470.

Small Business Firms 
This rule could result in costs for 
small business firms in the form of rule 
familiarization costs, and cost savings 
through the elimination of 
implementation and recordkeeping 
costs that would otherwise have been 
imposed by the Nondisplacement final 
rule. 
1. Rule Familiarization Costs 
As mentioned previously in section V, 
the Department estimates that, on 
average, affected firms will spend an 
average of 19 minutes reviewing this 
rule. Some firms will spend more time 
reviewing the rule, but many others will 
spend less or no time reviewing the 
rule, so the Department believes that 
this average estimate is appropriate. The 
Department assumes that a 
Compensation, Benefits, and Job 
Analysis Specialist (SOC 13–1141) with 
a median hourly wage of $30.83 will 
review this rulemaking. The Department 
also assumes that benefits are paid at a 
rate of 46 percent of the base wage and 
overhead costs are paid at a rate of 17 
percent of the base wage, resulting in a 
per firm cost of $50.25. Using the GDP 
deflator to inflate this into 2024 dollars 
and applying the 19 minutes to review 
the rule corresponds to a rate of $18.08 
per small firm. 
2. Cost Savings 
Small entities should experience cost 
savings due to the elimination of the 
implementation costs that would 
otherwise have been imposed by the 
Nondisplacement final rule. In the 
Nondisplacement final rule, the 
Department estimated that it would take 
an average of 30 minutes total for 
contractors to incorporate the contract 
clause into their covered subcontracts 
and another 45 minutes for contractors 
to retroactively incorporate a contract 
clause into subcontracts when it was not 
initially incorporated. The Department 
has estimated the cost savings of 
eliminating this requirement to be 
$62.81 per hour ($50.25 per hour × 1.25 hours). Using the GDP deflator to inflate 
this into 2024 dollars corresponds to a 
rate of $71.35 per small firm. 
For cost savings incurred from the 
elimination of the recordkeeping 
requirement, the Department estimates 
that the extra time associated with 
keeping and providing these records to 
be an average of 1 hour and be 
completed by Compensation, Benefits, 
and Job Analysis Specialist of $50.25 
per hour. Using the GDP deflator to 
inflate this into 2024 dollars 
corresponds to a cost savings of $57.10 
per small firm. 
C. Summary of Costs and Cost Savings 
Undiscounted regulatory 
familiarization costs for small 
businesses are estimated to range 
between a lower-bound estimate of 
$1.18 million ($50.25 per hour × (19 minutes ÷ 60) hour × 74,097 contractors), to a higher-bound estimate 
of $5.24 million ($50.25 per hour × (19 minutes ÷ 60) hour × 329,470 contractors). 
As discussed in section V, the 
Department used the lower-bound of 
potentially affected firms (119,695) to 
estimate total cost savings because only 
the firms with a covered contract are 
likely to incur implementation and 
recordkeeping costs. For purposes of 
estimating cost savings for small 
businesses, the Department applies this 
same methodology and uses the lower- 
bound of potentially affected small 
firms (i.e., 74,097 contractors). As noted above, the Department estimates cost 
savings in the amount of $128.45 per 
small firm ($71.35 in implementation 
cost savings + $57.10 in recordkeeping 
cost savings), which results in estimated 
cost savings of $9.52 million on small 
businesses ($128.45 per hour × 74,097 contractors).

the total undiscounted net cost savings 
for small firms in the amount of $4.28 
million ($9.52 million in cost savings ¥ 
$5.24 million in costs).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
The annual management measures for 
the 2025–2026 ocean salmon fisheries 
(90 FR 20810, May 16, 2025; 90 FR 
26943, June 25, 2025) govern the 
commercial and recreational fisheries in 
the area from the United States/Canada 
border to the United States/Mexico 
border, effective from 0001 hours Pacific 
Daylight Time (PDT), May 16, 2025, 
until the effective date of the 2026–2027 
management measures, as published in 
the Federal Register. NMFS is authorized to implement inseason 
management actions to modify fishing 
seasons, catch limits, and quotas as 
necessary to provide fishing 
opportunities while meeting 
management objectives for the affected 
species (50 CFR 660.409). Inseason 
actions in the salmon fishery may be 
taken directly by NMFS (50 CFR 
660.409(a)—Fixed inseason 
management provisions) or upon 
consultation with the Chairman of the 
Pacific Fishery Management Council 
(Council), and the appropriate State 
Directors (50 CFR 660.409(b)—Flexible 
inseason management provisions).

Inseason Actions 
Inseason Action #1 
Description of the action: Inseason 
action #1 modified the ocean salmon 
troll commercial fishery from the United 
States/Canada border to Cape Falcon, 
OR. 
Effective dates: Inseason action #1 
took effect for the following areas and 
dates, and remained in effect until 
superseded on May 22, 2025. 
€Effective at 2 p.m. on Friday, May 16, 2025, through 11:59 p.m. May 22, 
2025, for the ocean salmon troll 
commercial fishery, the landing and 
possession limit for the entire area 
between Cape Falcon and the United 
States/Canada border is 60 Chinook 
salmon per vessel per landing week 
(Thursday through Wednesday). 
€Effective at 2 p.m. on Friday, May 16, 2025, through 11:59 p.m. June 29, 
2025, for the ocean salmon troll 
commercial fishery, the landing and 
possession limit in the subarea United 
States/Canada border to the Queets 
River was modified from 100 Chinook 
salmon per vessel per landing week to 
50 Chinook salmon per vessel per 
landing week (Thursday through 
Wednesday). 
€Effective at 2 p.m. on Friday, May 16, 2025, through 11:59 p.m. June 29, 
2025, for the ocean salmon troll 
commercial fishery, the landing and 
possession limit in the subarea Queets 
River to Leadbetter Point is 50 Chinook 
salmon per vessel per landing week 
(Thursday through Wednesday). 
€Effective at 2 p.m. on Friday, May 16, 2025, through 11:59 p.m. June 29, 
2025, for the ocean salmon troll 
commercial fishery, the landing and 
possession limit in the subarea between 
Leadbetter Point and Cape Falcon was 
modified from 80 Chinook salmon per 
vessel per landing week to 60 Chinook 
salmon per vessel per landing week 
(Thursday through Wednesday). 
Reason and authorization for the 
action: Due to higher than anticipated catch rates and effort in the early season 
period between May 8, 2025, through 
May 15, 2025, the landing and 
possession limits were decreased to 
preserve the quota for the length of the 
season, and to manage the quota based 
on the specifics of each subarea 
consistent with the Fishery Management 
Plan (FMP). To accompany this, a 
landing and possession limit was set for 
the entire area NOF as well as limits for 
particular subareas. Fishers were 
allowed to catch in multiple subareas, 
but not exceed the NOF landing and 
possession limit when combined. This 
overall landing and possession limit 
was intended to further slow the fishery 
as it would avoid fishers catching the 
full subarea limit in multiple subareas, 
and thus contribute further to 
preserving the quota for the length of 
the season. Additionally, having a limit 
for the entire NOF area and lower limits 
in certain subareas ensures fair fishing 
opportunity throughout the fishery. One 
limit for the entire NOF area allows for 
enhanced ability to manage the quota 
effectively and prevent combined 
subarea catch from exceeding the quota. 
The varying limits throughout the 
smaller subareas allow for greater access 
to the quota based on the availability of 
fish in each subarea, which allows for 
more equitable fishing opportunity. 
The Regional Administrator (RA) 
considered the abundance forecasts for 
Chinook salmon stocks, the timing of 
the action relative to the length of the 
season, catch and effort to date, 
projected catch and effort under the 
proposed action, and other relevant 
factors and determined that the inseason 
action described above is necessary to 
meet management and conservation 
goals set preseason. This inseason 
action modifies species caught and 
landed during specific seasons and the 
establishment or modification of limited 
retention regulations under 50 CFR 
660.409(b)(1)(ii). 
Inseason Actions #2–#3 
Description of action #2: Inseason 
action #2 modified the ocean salmon 
troll commercial fishery from the United 
States/Canada border to Cape Falcon, 
OR. The Chinook salmon landing and 
possession limit for the commercial 
salmon troll fishery across the entire 
north of Cape Falcon area, regardless of 
subarea, was modified from 60 Chinook 
salmon per vessel per landing week to 
70 Chinook per vessel per week 
(Thursday–Wednesday). 
Effective dates of inseason action #2: 
Inseason action #2 took effect on May 
22, 2025, at 5 p.m. and remained in 
effect until superseded on June 5, 2025. 
Description of inseason action #3: 
Inseason action #3 modified the ocean 
salmon troll commercial fishery from 
the United States/Canada border to Cape 
Falcon, OR. 
Effective dates of inseason action #3: 
Inseason action #3 took effect for the 
following areas and dates, and remained 
in effect until superseded on June 12, 
2025. 
€Effective at 3 p.m. on June 5, 2025, through 11:59 p.m. on June 29, 2025, the 
Chinook salmon landing and possession 
limit for the entire north of Cape Falcon 
area, was modified from 70 Chinook 
salmon per vessel per landing week to 
125 Chinook salmon per vessel per 
landing week (Thursday through 
Wednesday). 
€Effective at 3 p.m. on June 5, 2025, through 11:59 p.m. on June 29, 2025, for 
the ocean salmon troll fishery, the 
landing and possession limit for the 
subarea between the United States/ 
Canada border and the Queets River is 
modified from 70 Chinook salmon per 
vessel per landing week to 100 Chinook 
salmon per vessel per landing week 
(Thursday through Wednesday). 
€Effective at 3 p.m. on June 5, 2025, through 11:59 p.m. on June 29, 2025, for 
the ocean salmon troll fishery, the 
landing and possession limit for the 
subarea between the Queets River and 
Leadbetter Point is modified from 70 
Chinook salmon per vessel per landing 
week to 125 Chinook salmon per vessel 
per landing week (Thursday through 
Wednesday). 
€Effective at 3 p.m. on June 5, 2025, through 11:59 p.m. on June 29, 2025, for 
the ocean salmon troll fishery, the 
landing and possession limit for the 
subarea between Leadbetter Point and 
Cape Falcon is modified from 70 
Chinook salmon per vessel per landing 
week to 100 Chinook salmon per vessel 
per landing week (Thursday through 
Wednesday). 
Reason and authorization for 
Inseason Actions #2–#3: Inseason 
actions #2–#3 were necessary to raise 
landing and possession limits after

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with RULES59742 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Rules and Regulations and the two landing weeks of May 22, 
2025, to June 4, 2025. Overall effort and 
catch rates decreased due to poor 
weather conditions over the course of 
the time period. With the greater 
amount of quota remaining there was 
opportunity to increase landing and 
possession limits and provide greater 
access to the remaining May–June 
quota. In addition, a landing and 
possession limit was set for the entire 
NOF as well as limits for particular 
subareas. Fishers were allowed to catch 
in multiple subareas, but not exceed the 
NOF landing and possession limit when 
combined. This overall landing and 
possession limit was intended to further 
slow the fishery as it would avoid 
fisheries catching the full subarea limit 
in multiple subareas, and thus 
contribute further to preserving the 
quota for the length of the season. This 
allowed for an increase in fishing 
opportunities without exceeding 
subarea landing and possession limits 
consistent with conservation goals and 
prevented overfishing in some subareas. 
Additionally, having a limit for the 
entire NOF area and lower limits in 
certain subareas ensures fair fishing 
opportunity throughout the fishery. One 
limit for the entire NOF area allows for 
enhanced ability to manage the quota 
effectively and prevent combined 
subarea catch from exceeding the quota. 
The varying limits throughout the 
smaller subareas allow for greater access 
to the quota based on the availability of 
fish in each subarea, which allows for 
more equitable fishing opportunity. 
The RA considered the abundance 
forecasts for Chinook salmon stocks, the 
timing of the action relative to the 
length of the season, the catch and effort 
to date relative to the remaining quota, 
projected catch and effort, and other 
relevant factors like weather, and 
determined that these inseason actions 
described above are necessary to meet 
management and conservation goals set 
preseason. These inseason actions 
modify species caught and landed 
during specific seasons and the 
establishment or modification of limited 
retention regulations under 50 CFR 
660.409(b)(1)(ii). 
Inseason Action #4 
Description of the action: Inseason 
action #4 modified the Chinook salmon 
landing and possession limit for the 
commercial salmon troll fishery across 
the entire north of Cape Falcon area, 
was modified from 125 Chinook salmon 
per landing week to 70 Chinook salmon 
per vessel per landing week (Thursday– 
Wednesday). 
Effective dates: Inseason action #4 
took effect at 12:01 a.m. on June 12, 
2025, and remained in effect until 
superseded on June 18, 2025. 
Reason and authorization for the 
action: Due to an increase in effort and catch rates for the fishing week of June 
5, 2025, through June 11, 2025, the 
landing and possession limit was 
decreased across all subareas to preserve 
the quota for the length of the season. 
The RA considered the abundance 
forecasts for Chinook salmon stocks, the 
timing of the action relative to the 
length of the season, catch and effort to 
date, projected catch and effort under 
the proposed action, and other relevant 
factors and determined that the inseason 
action described above is necessary to 
meet management and conservation 
goals set preseason. This inseason 
action modifies species caught and 
landed during specific seasons and the 
establishment or modification of limited 
retention regulations under 50 CFR 
660.409(b)(1)(ii). 
Inseason Action #5 
Description of the action: Inseason 
action #5 modified the NOF commercial 
salmon troll fishery. The spring season 
for the commercial salmon troll fishery 
in the area north of Cape Falcon is 
closed. 
Effective dates: Inseason action #5 
took effect at 11:59 p.m. on June 18, 
2025, and remained in effect until the 
start of the summer season, unless 
otherwise superseded. 
Reason and authorization for the 
action: Due to high catch rates during the landing week of June 12, 2025, 
through June 18, 2025, it was necessary 
to close the fishery in order to avoid 
exceeding the quota. 
The RA considered the abundance 
forecasts for Chinook salmon stocks, the 
timing of the action relative to the 
length of the season, catch and effort to 
date, projected catch and effort under 
the proposed action, and other relevant 
factors and determined that the inseason 
action described above is necessary to 
meet management and conservation 
goals set preseason. This inseason 
action modifies quotas and/or fishing 
seasons as authorized under 50 CFR 
660.409(b)(1)(i). 
All other restrictions and regulations 
remain in effect as announced for the 
2025–2026 ocean salmon fisheries (90 
FR 20810, May 16, 2025; 90 FR 26943, 
June 25, 2025) except as previously 
modified by inseason actions. 
As provided by the inseason notice 
procedures at 50 CFR 660.411, actual 
notice of the described regulatory 
actions was given, prior to the time the 
actions became effective, by telephone 
hotline numbers 206–526–6667 and 
800–662–9825, and by U.S. Coast Guard 
Notice to Mariners broadcasts on 
Channel 16 VHF–FM and 2182 kHz. 
Classification 
NMFS issues these actions pursuant 
to section 305(d) of the MSA. These 
actions are authorized by 50 CFR 
660.409, which was issued pursuant to 
section 304(b) of the MSA, and are 
exempt from review under Executive 
Order 12866. 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), there 
is good cause to waive prior notice and 
an opportunity for public comment on 
this action, as notice and comment 
would be impracticable and contrary to 
the public interest. Prior notice and 
opportunity for public comment on this 
action was impracticable because NMFS 
had insufficient time to provide for 
prior notice and the opportunity for 
public comment between the time 
Chinook and coho salmon abundance, 
catch, and effort information were 
developed and fisheries impacts were 
calculated, and the time the fishery 
modifications had to be implemented in 
order to ensure fishing opportunity 
consistent with conservation needs and 
management objectives is made 
available, and/or fisheries are managed 
consistent with quotas and conservation 
objectives. There is a heightened need to 
respond quickly to inseason information 
about the salmon fishery because fish 
migrate quickly through the Exclusive 
Economic Zone (EEZ) and the mix of 
stocks in the EEZ shifts throughout the 
season, thus the time available between 
the time new information about the 
fishery becomes available and the 
opportunity to act effectively on that 
information is short. By the time public 
notice and comment would be 
completed, the mix of stocks in the 
fishery would have changed such that 
inseason action would be ineffective 
and potentially harmful. Therefore, 
NMFS determined that waiving notice 
and comment in order to respond to 
updated information indicating the need 
for immediate action to provide fishing 
opportunity consistent with quotas and 
conservation objectives, or to avoid 
exceeding quotas, served the public 
interest. As previously noted, actual 
notice of the regulatory action was 
provided to fishers through telephone 
hotlines and radio notifications. These 
actions comply with the requirements of 
the annual management measures for 
ocean salmon fisheries (90 FR 20810, 
May 16, 2025), the Pacific Salmon 
Fishery Management Plan (FMP), and 
regulations implementing the FMP 
under 50 CFR 660.409 and 660.411. 
There is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 
553(d)(3) to waive the 30-day delay in 
effective date, as a delay in effectiveness

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Introduction 
Congress enacted the CRA
1
in 1977 
based on its findings that: ‘‘(1) regulated 
financial institutions are required by 
law to demonstrate that their deposit 
facilities serve the convenience and 
needs of the communities in which they 
are chartered to do business; (2) the 
convenience and needs of communities 
include the need for credit services as 
well as deposit services; and (3) 
regulated financial institutions have 
continuing and affirmative obligation[s] 
to help meet the credit needs of the 
local communities in which they are 
chartered.’’
2
Accordingly, the purpose 
of the CRA is to require the OCC
3
to 
encourage regulated financial 
institutions
4
‘‘to help meet the credit 
needs of the local communities in 
which they are chartered consistent 
with the safe and sound operation of the 
institutions.’’
5
To achieve this purpose, 
the CRA requires the OCC to ‘‘assess 
[an] institution’s record of meeting the 
credit needs of its entire community, 
including low- and moderate-income 
neighborhoods, consistent with the safe 
and sound operation of such 
institution.’’
6
Upon completing this 
assessment, the statute requires the OCC 
to ‘‘prepare a written evaluation of the 
institution’s record of meeting the credit 
needs of its entire community,

12 U.S.C. 2905. Pursuant to Title III of the Dodd- 
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act, Public Law 111–203, 124 Stat. 1376, 1522 
(2010), the Office of Thrift Supervision’s (OTS) CRA 
rulemaking authority for all savings associations 
transferred to the OCC and the OTS’s CRA 
supervisory authority for State savings associations 
transferred to the FDIC. As a result, the OCC’s CRA 
regulation applies to both State and Federal savings 
associations, in addition to national banks, and the 
FDIC enforces the OCC’s CRA regulation with 
respect to State savings associations. 
10
For purposes of this SUPPLEMENTARY 
INFORMATION, the term ‘‘bank’’ includes insured 
national banks, Federal savings associations, and 
certain Federal branches of foreign banks as defined 
in 12 CFR 25.11 (Mar. 29, 2024). 
11
43 FR 47144 (Oct. 12, 1978). 
12
The OCC originally issued separate regulations 
for national banks and Federal savings associations 
in 12 CFR part 25 and part 195, respectively. The 
OCC integrated these CRA regulations in its 2021 
CRA final rule into a single CRA regulation, 12 CFR 
part 25, applicable to national banks and savings 
associations (2021 CRA Regulation). See 86 FR 71328 (Dec. 15, 2021). 
13
The simplified strategic plan process proposed 
in this 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATIONwould provide 
timely guidance on the OCC’s interpretation and 
application of the CRA regulation that the agency 
is currently applying to its regulated institutions, 
often referred to as the 1995/2021 CRA Regulations. 
The OCC, together with the FDIC and the Board 
(collectively, the agencies), and the former OTS, 
first adopted the 1995 CRA Regulations on May 4, 
1995. 60 FR 22156 (May 4, 1995). The OCC reissued 
the 1995 CRA Regulation, as amended, with non- 
substantive changes on December 15, 2021—the 
2021 CRA Regulation. See 86 FR 71328. For purposes of this 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, 
references to the CRA regulation are to the OCC’s 
2021 CRA Regulation as published in the Electronic 
Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR) as of March 29, 
2024, which is substantively identical to the FDIC’s 
and Board’s 1995 CRA Regulations, as amended. 
On October 23, 2023, the agencies had jointly 
issued a CRA final rule (2023 CRA Final Rule). The 
2023 CRA Final Rule is currently subject to a 
preliminary injunction by order of the U.S. District 
Court for the Northern District of Texas. See Tex. Bankers Ass’n v. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 728 F. Supp. 3d 412 (N.D. Tex. 2024). On July 16, 2025, the agencies issued a notice of 
proposed rulemaking (CRA Rescind and Replace 
NPR) to rescind the 2023 CRA Final Rule and 
replace it with the 1995/2021 CRA Regulations, as 
amended. See 90 FR 34086 (July 18, 2025). The comment period for the CRA Rescind and Replace 
NPR closed on August 18, 2025, and the agencies 
are considering the comments received on that 
proposal. The OCC will continue to apply the 2021 
CRA Regulation as published in the Federal 
Register on March 29, 2024, for as long as the preliminary injunction of the 2023 CRA Final Rule 
remains in effect. Should the agencies finalize the 
CRA Rescind and Replace NPR in the future, the 
OCC would continue to apply the 2021 CRA 
Regulation to banks indefinitely. In proposing the 
simplified strategic plan process, the OCC 
considered that a strategic plan provision was a 
component of the 1995/2021 CRA Regulations and 
the 2023 CRA Final Rule, and that timely guidance 
that reduces burden for community banks is an 
important objective even if future modifications to 
the guidance were to become necessary.

unemployment, and population loss; or (B) 
population size, density, and dispersion. See 12 CFR 25.12(g) (Mar. 29, 2024).

Under the CRA regulation, for calendar year 
2025, a small bank is defined as a bank that had 
assets of less than $1.609 billion as of December 31 
of either of the prior two calendar years. Within the 
definition of small bank, an ‘‘intermediate small 
bank’’ is defined as a bank with assets of at least 
$402 million as of December 31 of both of the prior 
two calendar years and less than $1.609 billion as 
of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar 
years. The small bank asset-size threshold is 
adjusted annually based on the year-to-year change 
in the average of the Consumer Price Index for 
Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI–W), 
not seasonally adjusted, for each 12-month period 
ending in November, with rounding to the nearest 
million. See 12 CFR 25.12(u) (Mar. 29, 2024); see also OCC, ‘‘Community Reinvestment Act: Revision of Small and Intermediate Small Bank and Savings 
Association Asset Thresholds’’ (Dec. 23, 2024),

28
See 12 CFR 25.27 (Mar. 29, 2024) (strategic plan provision). 
including low- and moderate-income 
neighborhoods.’’
7
The statute further 
provides that the OCC must ‘‘take such 
record into account in its evaluation of 
an application for a deposit facility by 
such institution.’’
8
 
The CRA directs the OCC to publish 
regulations to carry out the purposes of 
the CRA.
9
In general, the OCC’s CRA 
regulation, first promulgated in 1978, 
establishes the standards under which 
the OCC evaluates banks’
10
CRA 
performance.
11
The OCC’s 1995 CRA 
regulations
12
significantly revised and 
clarified the 1978 CRA regulations. 
Currently, the OCC evaluates banks’ 
CRA performance pursuant to the 1995 
CRA regulation, as amended in the 
OCC’s 2021 CRA Final Rule (CRA 
regulation).
13
During the OCC’s 30 years 
of experience examining banks under 
the CRA regulation, the agency has 
developed an in-depth understanding of 
how banks of different sizes and 
business models meet the credit needs 
of their communities. This includes 
community banks, which under the 
OCC’s current organizational structure, 
are those with up to $30 billion in 
assets.
14
The OCC also has received 
extensive feedback on the benefits of, as 
well as stakeholder concerns with, the 
CRA regulation.
15
 
A. The Strategic Plan Option 
Under the CRA regulation, any bank 
may elect to have the OCC assess its 
CRA performance under an approved 
strategic plan (strategic plan option).
16
 
A CRA strategic plan provides a bank 
with an alternative to the OCC’s 
examination of its CRA performance 
under the otherwise applicable 
performance tests and standards.
17
 
Specifically, the CRA regulation 
includes performance tests and 
standards for banks of different sizes 
and types. The OCC uses these 
performance tests and standards to 
assess banks’ performance under the 
CRA. Depending on a community bank’s 
size or business model, the OCC may 
examine the bank pursuant to the (1) 
lending test,
18
investment test,
19

as 
applicable; or (3) CD test for wholesale 
or limited purpose banks.
25
The OCC 
examines small banks
26
using the 
lending test in the small bank 
performance standards. In addition, 
intermediate small banks are also 
evaluated pursuant to the CD test in the 
small bank performance standards. The 
OCC evaluates banks that exceed the 
small bank asset-size threshold— 
commonly referred to as large banks— 
using the lending test, investment test, 
and service test. In addition, the OCC 
evaluates a bank designated under the 
CRA regulation as a wholesale bank or 
a limited purpose bank
27
using the CD 
test for wholesale and limited purpose 
banks. 
The strategic plan option
28
enables a 
bank to tailor its CRA examination 
based on the needs of its community 
and its ability to help address those 
needs based on its capacity and 
constraints, product offerings, and 
business strategy. The CRA regulation 
requires a bank seeking to elect the 
strategic plan option to develop a plan

As of April 23, 2025, the OCC had 14 banks 
with approved strategic plans. Of these banks (1) 10 
banks had their initial strategic plan approved by 
the OCC in 2020 or later; (2) 10 banks had assets 
of up to $30 billion; and (3) 12 banks were non- 
traditional banks (i.e., banks with business models that generally are not branch-based or do not focus 
on extending retail credit to consumers, small 
business, or small farms).

38
The OCC determined that the current guidance 
is appropriate and sufficient for larger, more 
complex banks because it allows those banks to 
appropriately tailor the design, supporting 
information, and content of their strategic plans. As 
the OCC gains experience with the simplified 
strategic plan process for community banks, the 
agency will consider whether its use should be 
expanded to other banks.

with when electing the strategic plan 
option
32
and (2) the OCC’s criteria for 
evaluating and approving a proposed

B. Overview of Feedback on CRA- 
Related Regulatory Burden and the 
Strategic Plan Option 
Over the years, certain stakeholders 
have expressed concern with CRA- 
related regulatory burden, especially 
burden on smaller banks with more 
limited resources. The OCC recognizes 
that concerns with CRA-related 
regulatory burden stem, in part, from 
the qualitative evaluation framework 
provided in the CRA regulation’s 
otherwise applicable performance tests 
and standards, which may make it 
difficult for banks to understand the 
OCC’s supervisory expectations. This 
lack of transparency may also make it 
more challenging for banks to effectively 
manage their CRA programs. Further, 
the OCC has observed that the CRA 
regulation’s otherwise applicable 
performance tests and standards may 
not be well suited for evaluating certain 
banks’ business models, particularly in 
an evolving banking industry. For these 
banks, the current CRA regulatory 
framework may not effectively 
encourage or increase CRA-qualifying 
activity. 
Considering this background, certain 
stakeholders have conveyed the 
importance of the strategic plan option, 
commenting that strategic plans should 
be available to all banks and could be 
useful for many banks, particularly 
branchless banks and banks with unique 
business models.
34
Further, some 
stakeholders have suggested simplifying 
the process for small banks to elect the 
strategic plan option.
35
 
Because of the certainty and 
flexibility that the strategic plan option 
provides banks to tailor their CRA 
examinations, the OCC has witnessed an 
increase in non-traditional banks’ use of 
the strategic plan option, including 
certain community banks.
36
However, 
the OCC understands from its 
interactions with banks that the current 
strategic plan process can be complex 
and difficult to navigate. As a result, 
overall election of the strategic plan 
option remains limited.
37
Given the 
flexibility provided by the strategic plan 
option, the OCC believes that it may be 
a useful tool for reducing CRA-related 
regulatory burden for all community 
banks—from the smallest retail 
community banks to larger, non- 
traditional community banks that offer 
their products and services through the 
internet. 
Consistent with stakeholder feedback, 
the OCC has determined that the 
strategic plan option could be a useful 
means for more community banks to 
tailor their CRA examinations based on 
bank size and other relevant factors. 
Further, the OCC has determined that 
providing a simplified strategic plan 
process for community banks would 
facilitate their ability to elect the 
strategic plan option. Evaluation under 
a strategic plan would provide 
community banks with clear CRA 
supervisory expectations and enable the 
banks to better focus their resources on 
meeting community credit needs. 
Specifically, community banks may find 
it challenging to determine what 
constitutes a ‘‘Satisfactory’’ or 
‘‘Outstanding’’ level of performance 
under the otherwise applicable 
performance tests and standards or for 
purposes of the strategic plan option 
due to more limited in-house 
compliance and legal expertise and less 
robust compliance management 
systems, as compared with larger banks. 
While the strategic plan option is 
intended to provide banks with more 
certainty in their CRA examinations, 
community banks may find electing the 
strategic plan option difficult without 
help from outside consultants. This is 
because the current strategic plan 
guidance lacks clarity regarding the 
required components of a strategic plan, 
including what would constitute 
reasonable measurable goals. Based on 
feedback from banks, the OCC 
understands that these circumstances 
have had a chilling effect on banks’ use 
of the strategic plan option, particularly 
community banks. 
In addition to providing clarity, the 
proposed guidance would simplify the 
process for community banks electing 
the strategic plan option and help to 
potentially reduce their CRA-related 
regulatory burden—making the strategic 
plan option a more viable alternative for 
these banks.
38
Electing the strategic plan 
option would facilitate a community 
bank’s ability to focus resources on 
engaging in CRA-qualifying activities 
consistent with the measurable goals 
specified in the bank’s strategic plan. 
Reducing community banks’ CRA- 
related regulatory burden is also 
consistent with the purpose and 
underlying policy of Executive Order 
14192, Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation—‘‘reduc[ing] the private 
expenditures required to comply with 
Federal regulations to secure America’s 
economic prosperity and national 
security and the highest possible quality 
of life for each citizen.’’
39
 
II. Simplified Strategic Plan Process for 
Community Banks 
Despite the potential advantages, as 
discussed above, banks have 
infrequently elected the strategic plan 
option.
40
This has been especially true 
for community banks, although recently 
the OCC has experienced a relative 
increase in community bank strategic 
plans. The proposed simplified strategic 
plan process would reduce burden for 
community banks by (1) providing more 
detailed guidance on the measurable 
goals and the other components of a 
strategic plan required by the CRA 
regulation and (2) simplifying the 
method for drafting and submitting a

This explanation of the strategic plan provision 
is consistent with the explanation provided in the 
1994 CRA proposal preceding the 1995 CRA 
regulation, which is substantively similar in 
relevant part to the strategic plan provision that was 
ultimately included in the CRA regulation. See 59 FR 51232, 51242–51243 (Oct. 7, 1994); see also 12 
CFR 25.27(f) (Mar. 29, 2024).

proposed strategic plan to the OCC for 
approval. 
To develop the proposed simplified 
strategic plan process, the OCC 
reviewed current CRA guidance to 
identify opportunities to provide clarity 
on, and increase the efficiency of, 
strategic plan development. The OCC’s 
current guidance for banks’ electing the 
strategic plan option is provided in OCC 
Bulletin 2019–39.
41
This guidance 
provides the OCC’s process for 
submitting a proposed strategic plan to 
the agency for approval but does not 
provide much clarification on how to 
develop a proposed strategic plan. 
In addition, OCC Bulletin 2019–39 
and the Interagency Questions and 
Answers on Community Reinvestment 
(Q&As) explain that banks may consult 
with and provide information to the 
OCC on a proposed strategic plan, and 
the OCC will provide guidance on 
whether the level of detail in the 
proposed plan would be sufficient to 
permit the OCC to evaluate the plan.
42
 
This guidance explains, however, that 
the OCC’s advice on a bank’s proposed 
strategic plan does not include 
commenting on the merits of the 
proposed strategic plan or the adequacy 
of the bank’s measurable goals. As 
discussed below, the OCC has found 
that the consultation process described 
in the current guidance is often 
insufficient, and, in practice, banks 
generally require more detailed 
feedback during the strategic plan 
development process to help manage 
the burden of drafting a strategic plan.
43
 
The OCC believes that the limited 
guidance on the strategic plan option 
has contributed to the burden associated 
with the current strategic plan process. 
The OCC understands that many 
community banks perceive the burden 
of developing a proposed strategic plan 
to outweigh the benefit of being 
evaluated under a strategic plan.
44
The 
OCC believes that providing more clear 
and detailed guidance and a simplified 
process for the development of a 
strategic plan would make the strategic 
plan option a more viable alternative for 
a greater number of community banks 
and facilitate burden reduction in 
connection with the banks’ CRA 
compliance. 
A. Measurable Goals, In General 
The CRA regulation’s strategic plan 
provision provides that a bank’s 
strategic plan must specify annual 
interim measurable goals that constitute 
a ‘‘Satisfactory’’ level of performance for 
each assessment area covered by the 
strategic plan.
45
In addition to 
‘‘Satisfactory’’ measurable goals, the 
CRA regulation provides that a bank’s 
strategic plan may specify measurable 
goals that constitute an ‘‘Outstanding’’ 
level of performance.
46
 
Generally, the CRA regulation 
provides that a bank’s proposed 
measurable goals must address all three 
performance categories (i.e., lending, investment, and services) and, unless 
the bank has been designated as a 
wholesale or limited purpose bank, 
must emphasize lending and lending- 
related activities.
47
However, the CRA 
regulation also states that a different 
emphasis, including a focus on one or 
more performance categories, may be 
appropriate if responsive to the 
characteristics and credit needs of a 
bank’s assessment areas, considering 
public comment and the bank’s capacity 
and constraints, product offerings, and 
business strategy.
48
Notably, the CRA 
regulation provides banks with 
flexibility in developing a proposed 
strategic plan and does not require 
banks to specify measurable goals in all 
three performance categories. A 
community bank should consider its 
particular facts and circumstances and 
the credit needs of its community to 
determine the appropriate performance 
categories to include in its proposed 
strategic plan. The OCC’s goal in 
developing the simplified strategic plan 
process is to enhance the substantial 
flexibility for community banks to tailor 
their CRA programs as intended by the 
strategic plan provision.
49
 
i. Establishing Measurable Goals 
Currently, the available guidance on 
what constitutes an appropriate 
measurable goal is limited. The Q&As 
provide some explanation regarding the 
meaning of ‘‘measurable goals’’ in the 
CRA regulation, but the Q&As do not 
explain how a community bank would 
determine the appropriate level of 
performance for those goals. 
Specifically, the Q&As provide that 
annual interim measurable goals (e.g., 
number of loans, dollar amount, 
geographic location of activity, and 
benefit to LMI areas or individuals) 
must be stated with sufficient specificity 
to permit the public and the OCC to 
quantify what performance will be 
expected.
50
However, banks are 
provided flexibility in specifying 
measurable goals.
51
The Q&A explains, 
for example, that a bank may provide 
ranges of lending amounts in different 
categories of loans or that measurable 
goals may be linked to funding 
requirements of certain public programs 
or indexed to other external factors as 
long as these mechanisms provide a 
quantifiable standard.
52
In the OCC’s 
experience, the existing guidance is 
insufficient to enable banks, especially 
community banks, to draft proposed 
strategic plans without considerable 
support from the OCC or external 
consultants. For larger, more 
sophisticated banks, however, the 
current guidance provides appropriate 
flexibility to customize their strategic 
plans to the banks’ unique 
circumstances. In contrast, community 
banks generally have less complex 
business strategies, resulting in a 
disconnect between the regulatory 
burden associated with developing a 
proposed strategic plan and the 
perceived benefits that would result 
from evaluation under an approved 
strategic plan. As noted above, this 
disconnect has chilled community 
banks’ election of the strategic plan 
option and supports developing a 
simplified strategic plan process for 
community banks. 
Under the proposed simplified 
strategic plan process for community 
banks, the OCC would provide more 
specific guidance on the types of 
measurable goals, including the 
performance measures (e.g., percentage, number, dollar amount, or other 
quantifiable measure of a particular type 
of lending, investment, or service) and 
performance levels (i.e., the specific value for a performance measure, such 
as a set percentage of lending), that may 
be appropriate for community banks 
based on the agency’s supervisory 
experience. Specifically, the OCC would 
provide examples of measurable goals 
that a community bank could adopt in 
its proposed strategic plan (hereinafter, 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  21:20 Dec 19, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\22DEP1.SGM 22DEP1
tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with PROPOSALS59748 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Proposed Rules 53
The CRA regulation provides that the OCC 
considers whether to approve a proposed strategic 
plan based on a bank’s performance context, and 
the strategic plan provision references certain 
performance context factors (i.e., capacity and constraints, product offerings, and business 
strategy) that a bank should consider in specifying 
measurable goals. See 12 CFR 25.21(b) and 25.27(f) (Mar. 29, 2024). 
54
See 12 CFR 25.27(d) and (g)(2) (Mar. 29, 2024). 55
The proposed elective goals were designed for 
use in the simplified strategic plan process for 
community banks only. Because the 
appropriateness of a particular elective goal for use 
in a community bank’s proposed strategic plan 
would be based on the bank’s circumstances and 
determined after the opportunity for public 
comment, the elective goals should not be 
considered benchmarks for ‘‘Satisfactory’’ or 
‘‘Outstanding’’ CRA performance outside the 
simplified strategic plan process. Even in the 
context of the simplified strategic plan process, a 
community bank would need to consider 
performance context to determine whether to use 
any of the elective goals in its proposed strategic 
plan. 
56
The proposed elective goals would be 
incorporated into the Simplified Strategic Plan 
Form, discussed infra. 
57
T1 capital refers to the sum of common equity 
T1 capital and additional T1 capital. See 12 CFR 3.2; see also 12 CFR 3.20(b) and (c). With respect to CD lending and qualified investments, the OCC 
has considered the dollar volume of a bank’s 
lending in comparison to its T1 capital as this 
measure provides context on the bank’s capacity to 
provide lending, investments, or services. 
58
While the OCC has not typically considered CD 
lending and qualified investments in comparison to 
total assets in the otherwise applicable performance 
tests and standards, banks have used total assets as 
a performance measure in approved strategic plans 
and the OCC generally considers it to be a 
reasonable measure of bank capacity. 
59
Under the otherwise applicable performance 
tests and standards, the OCC uses certain 
comparators to assess banks’ CRA performance 
including T1 capital, demographic comparators 
(e.g., LMI population) or peer comparators (e.g., peer bank lending activity). 
elective goals), as appropriate. A 
community bank may also include as 
measurable goals bank-specific, custom 
goals if it determines that the elective 
goals are not suitable for the bank based 
on its performance context,
53
or the 
bank identifies unique goals that it 
would like to include in its strategic 
plan. 
The OCC developed the proposed 
elective goals by considering 
measurable goals in approved strategic 
plans and the OCC’s experience in 
evaluating community banks’ CRA 
performance under the otherwise 
applicable performance tests and 
standards. A community bank could use 
one or more of the elective goals in its 
proposed strategic plan if, after 
considering its performance context, the 
bank determines those goals are an 
appropriate means of measuring the 
bank’s CRA performance. As discussed 
in greater detail below, the proposed 
elective goals reflect different levels of 
performance that the OCC would likely 
consider ‘‘Satisfactory’’ or 
‘‘Outstanding’’ for a community bank 
for that performance category or activity 
individually or in combination with 
other goals, depending on the 
circumstances. The elective goals, 
however, are not safe harbors and their 
use would not guarantee approval of a 
strategic plan. The OCC’s approval of a 
strategic plan would be provided only 
after a community bank were to 
undertake the required public 
engagement and adjust its proposed 
strategic plan to address public 
comments, as appropriate.
54
In 
approving a proposed strategic plan, the 
OCC would consider the criteria for 
evaluating a strategic plan provided in 
the CRA regulation, as discussed below. 
In drafting a proposed strategic plan, 
a community bank would comply with 
the regulatory requirement to address all 
three performance categories in its 
proposed strategic plan by specifying 
measurable goals for one or more 
performance categories and including 
related performance context. A 
community bank would also provide 
performance context addressing any 
performance categories for which the 
bank did not specify measurable goals. 
The measurable goals a community 
bank specifies in its proposed strategic 
plan, including the number of goals, 
combination of goals, represented 
performance categories, and 
performance levels for those goals must 
be appropriate and reasonable for the 
community bank based on its 
circumstances. Specifically, in selecting 
elective goals or developing custom 
goals, a community bank should 
consider the needs of and opportunities 
in the assessment areas covered by its 
strategic plan and its performance 
context, particularly the bank’s capacity 
and constraints, product offerings, and 
business strategy.
55
A community 
bank’s historical CRA performance may 
also be a relevant consideration. 
The OCC generally does not expect 
community banks’ use of the simplified 
strategic plan process to result in 
reductions in CRA-qualifying activities 
as compared to the existing process. In 
addition, the OCC plans to periodically 
assess and, if appropriate, update the 
elective goals.
56
For example, the OCC 
may revise or add to the elective goals 
to account for changing economic 
conditions, public comments received 
in connection with banks’ strategic 
plans, or other relevant information. 
Below is a discussion of considerations 
that informed the proposed guidance on 
measurable goals included in the 
simplified strategic plan process. 
ii. Elective Goals 
1. Performance Measures 
In the OCC’s experience, one of the 
reasons banks elect the strategic plan 
option is to establish specific 
performance targets that they can 
manage their CRA programs to achieve. 
The OCC has observed that banks often 
express measurable goals in terms of 
dollar amounts to maximize 
predictability. In some instances, 
however, banks have used other 
performance measures to set measurable 
goals, including percent of tier one (T1) 
capital
57
or total assets.
58
When using 
these other performance measures, 
banks allocate capital or assets to each 
assessment area. Typically, banks will 
use the percentage of deposits assigned 
to a given assessment area as the basis 
for this allocation. The proposed 
elective goals would rely on this 
allocation method for specifying 
measurable goals in each assessment 
area covered by the plan. For multi-year 
strategic plans, a bank would be 
required to establish annual interim 
measurable goals for each year in the 
strategic plan term. Generally, the OCC 
has expected a bank to annually 
increase the dollar-denominated 
thresholds in its interim goals to 
account for a bank’s expected growth 
and the resultant increase in capacity. 
Considering this background, the OCC 
reviewed the measurable goals in 
approved strategic plans and considered 
community banks’ CRA performance 
and the comparators used to assess that 
performance under the otherwise 
applicable performance tests and 
standards.
59
The OCC relied on this 
historical information to help identify 
potential elective goals that would 
generally reflect ‘‘Satisfactory’’ or 
‘‘Outstanding’’ performance for 
community banks depending on the 
circumstances, including the banks’ 
performance context. 
2. Performance Levels 
In the OCC’s experience, the adequacy 
of a bank’s level of performance is 
informed by the sufficiency with which 
a bank has addressed its obligation to 
meet community credit needs, 
accounting for the bank’s capacity to 
meet those needs. For example, the CRA 
requires that the OCC consider a bank’s 
record of performance in meeting 
community credit needs consistent with 
the bank’s safe or sound operations and 
the OCC would not expect banks to 
engage in levels of performance that 
would be unsafe or unsound. The OCC

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with PROPOSALS59749 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Proposed Rules has identified that additional 
performance context factors—such as 
community needs and opportunities 
and business strategy—result in some 
variation in the appropriate levels of 
performance amongst community banks. 
Further, the appropriate performance 
level for a particular goal included in a 
community bank’s proposed strategic 
plan would be influenced by whether 
the bank included other measurable 
goals in its strategic plan and the nature 
of those goals. The OCC also relied on 
its supervisory experience to identify 
additional factors that have influenced 
banks’ specification of measurable goals, 
including the performance measures 
used in the goals. After considering this 
information, and as explained further 
below, the OCC is proposing elective 
goals that are consistent with the 
performance measures and performance 
levels that the agency historically has 
expected of community banks with 
‘‘Satisfactory’’ or ‘‘Outstanding’’ ratings. 
3. Specifying Measurable Goals 
In specifying measurable goals, a 
community bank would determine 
which performance categories to 
include in its goals, and the 
performance measures and performance 
levels for the goals in those categories. 
The OCC expects that a community 
bank would specify measurable goals 
that are appropriate for the bank based 
on its performance context; however, 
because the strategic plan option 
provides community banks with 
significant flexibility to tailor their CRA 
examinations, measurable goals may 
vary even when comparing two 
similarly situated banks. Community 
banks may choose different variations of 
goals with different performance 
measures and performance levels to 
tailor their CRA examinations based on 
their individual circumstances. For that 
reason, the elective goals include 
performance measures with several 
options for performance levels. Further, 
community banks would have the 
option to specify custom goals to use in 
combination with or instead of the 
elective goals. 
The standardized form that 
community banks would use in 
connection with the simplified strategic 
plan process (hereinafter the Simplified Strategic Plan Form), discussed below, 
would include guidance for when a 
proposed elective goal may be 
appropriate for a community bank. For 
example, if a community bank’s 
strategic plan were to include 
measurable goals focused on only one 
performance category, the OCC would 
generally expect the bank to specify 
measurable goals with higher 
performance levels than if the bank had 
included measurable goals in multiple 
performance categories. This 
expectation is not categorically 
applicable, however. In the OCC’s view, 
it may be appropriate for certain 
community banks to specify fewer 
measurable goals with lower 
performance levels even if the bank 
does not include goals in all three 
performance categories. For example, it 
may be appropriate for a smaller 
community bank with a narrow product 
line to specify measurable goals in a 
single performance category at a 
performance level that would not be 
considered ‘‘Satisfactory’’ for a larger 
community bank with more diverse 
product offerings and greater capacity. 
Therefore, the guidance that would be 
included in the Simplified Strategic 
Plan Form along with the proposed 
elective goals would provide general 
guidelines for a community bank’s use 
of the elective goals. In addition to the 
guidance provided, a community bank 
should consider its performance context 
to determine the elective goals that 
would be appropriate based on the 
bank’s circumstances. 
The OCC considered different 
performance context factors and how 
those factors may influence the 
appropriate performance measures and 
performance levels that would be used 
to express a community bank’s 
proposed measurable goals. Specifically, 
performance context factors such as 
competition, market share, and bank 
size, or other bank-specific 
considerations may make total dollar 
amount alone an inadequate measure of 
a bank’s CRA performance. For 
example, the OCC determined that goals 
that measure performance by both 
number and dollar amount may be 
appropriate for a bank that focuses on a 
larger number of small dollar, highly 
responsive activities. Further, goals with 
lower assessment area performance 
levels may be appropriate when a 
community bank’s proposed strategic 
plan includes an elective goal with 
performance measures for an assessment 
area coupled with performance 
measures for the broader statewide or 
regional area that includes the 
assessment area. The OCC also 
determined that there are instances 
where it may not be reasonable, 
particularly without additional 
feedback, for the OCC to state elective 
goals with fixed performance levels, 
such as dollar-thresholds or percentage- 
based performance targets. In these 
circumstances, the OCC believes that it 
can improve on the current guidance by 
providing template-style elective goals 
that include a variable that the 
community bank would populate. 
Based on the information considered, 
the OCC determined that the elective 
goals should include different 
performance levels within the same 
performance categories, subcategories 
(e.g., retail lending goals and CD lending goals), or combined categories (e.g., a CD lending and qualified investment 
combined goal). In general, smaller, less 
complex community banks would 
consider elective goals with lower 
performance levels, while larger, more 
complex community banks would 
consider specifying elective goals with 
higher performance levels. This 
guidance aligns with the OCC’s different 
performance expectations based on its 
experience evaluating banks under the 
otherwise applicable performance tests 
and standards and in reviewing and 
approving strategic plans. Nonetheless, 
because performance context is unique 
to a bank, there may be exceptions from 
these general principles. 
The simplified strategic plan process 
would help reduce burden for 
community banks by providing greater 
insight into the considerations that have 
informed the OCC’s approval of strategic 
plans. The proposed guidance does not 
establish any new requirements for 
community banks. Instead, as discussed 
above, the proposed guidance would 
provide community banks with 
transparency into the types of 
measurable goals that the OCC has 
generally found to reflect ‘‘Satisfactory’’ 
or ‘‘Outstanding’’ performance and 
otherwise clarify and simplify the 
process for electing the strategic plan 
option. This transparency would 
facilitate a community bank’s 
consideration of its performance context 
and determination of appropriate 
measurable goals as is currently 
required for any bank electing the 
strategic plan option. As also noted 
above, this proposed guidance would 
not establish safe harbors guaranteeing 
approval of a proposed strategic plan; 
however, provided that a community 
bank adequately supported the 
inclusion of particular elective goals in 
its proposed strategic plan based on its 
circumstances and complied with the 
other requirements of the strategic plan 
provision, the OCC would be likely to 
approve the bank’s proposed strategic 
plan under the simplified strategic plan 
process. 
Questions: 
1. Does providing elective goals that a 
community bank may consider using as 
measurable goals in a proposed 
strategic plan provide clarity to 
community banks and make developing

Under the CRA regulation, a CD loan is defined 
as a loan that: (1) has as its primary purpose CD; 
and (2) except in the case of a wholesale or limited 
purpose bank: (i) has not been reported or collected 
by the bank or an affiliate for consideration in the 
bank’s assessment as a home mortgage, small 
business, small farm, or consumer loan, unless the 
loan is for a multifamily dwelling (as defined in 
§ 1003.2(n) of this title); and (ii) benefits the bank’s 
assessment area(s) or a broader statewide or 
regional area(s) that includes the bank’s assessment 
area(s). See 12 CFR 25.12(h) (Mar. 29, 2024). a proposed strategic plan less 
burdensome? 
2. Are there other factors that the OCC 
should consider in determining 
appropriate elective goals? 
3. For community banks that use the 
simplified strategic plan process, 
instead of setting performance levels for 
the elective goals based on the OCC’s 
existing performance expectations, 
should the OCC consider increasing or 
decreasing its expected level of 
performance? If so, how and why should 
the OCC revise community bank 
performance expectations in the elective 
goals? 
iii. Custom Goals 
As discussed above, the simplified 
strategic plan process would also 
include the option for a community 
bank to develop bank-specific, custom 
goals instead of, or in addition to, using 
the elective goals. Under the current 
strategic plan process, all measurable 
goals are custom goals because the OCC 
currently does not provide examples of 
what may constitute reasonable 
measurable goals. The simplified 
strategic plan process would include the 
option for community banks to develop 
custom goals to maintain the flexibility 
intended by the strategic plan option. 
A community bank may choose to 
develop a custom goal due to unique 
performance context factors or specific 
community needs that the bank wishes 
to address. This may be particularly 
appropriate for the performance 
categories with a more limited number 
of elective goals that apply to a narrow 
set of circumstances, as discussed 
below. Further, it may be appropriate 
for a bank to develop a custom goal that 
is similar to an elective goal but changes 
it in a meaningful way. For example, if 
an elective goal uses total assets as the 
performance measure, a community 
bank with cyclical assets instead may 
choose to specify a custom goal using 
average assets as its performance 
measure. A community bank would 
specify a custom goal along with any 
relevant performance context in its 
strategic plan. 
Question: 
4. Does providing guidance on custom 
goals appropriately simplify the 
strategic plan development process for 
community banks? Does this guidance 
appropriately balance the need for 
greater clarity on the types of goals that 
the OCC would likely approve for 
community banks with the flexibility 
intended by the strategic plan option to 
allow banks to tailor their CRA 
examinations? 
B. Performance Categories of 
Measurable Goals 
A community bank may include 
different types of measurable goals for 
the three performance categories (i.e., 
lending, investment, and services) in its 
proposed strategic plan. As noted above, 
the OCC based the proposed elective 
goals on the agency’s supervisory 
experience and other relevant 
information. Under the proposed 
simplified strategic plan process, a 
community bank would determine 
whether certain goals were appropriate 
for inclusion in the bank’s proposed 
strategic plan and when it may be 
appropriate to specify a custom goal. A 
community bank would include 
measurable goals for each assessment 
area included in its strategic plan. The 
number, combination, and represented 
performance categories for the elective 
goals or custom goals included in a 
community bank’s proposed strategic 
plan may vary depending on assessment 
area needs and opportunities. The 
proposed elective goals for each of the 
performance categories discussed below 
are included in Appendix A. 
i. Lending Performance Category 
1. CD Lending Goals 
Historically, banks have commonly 
included CD lending goals in their 
strategic plans.
60
Banks often express 
CD lending goals in terms of dollar 
amount; however, some banks have 
used other performance measures as the 
basis for a CD lending goal, such as a 
percentage of T1 capital or total assets 
allocated by deposits to each assessment 
area. The OCC understands that 
measurable goals expressed in terms of 
dollars provide banks with greater 
certainty while those expressed in terms 
of a percentage of T1 capital or total 
assets provide greater flexibility to 
adjust to future fluctuations in bank or 
economic conditions. Considering this 
background and the agency’s 
supervisory experience, the OCC 
identified the proposed elective goals 
based on percentages, but the guidance 
also would provide options for convert 
those percentages into dollar amounts of 
CD lending. 
Specifically, the OCC used a 
percentage of T1 capital or total assets 
as a starting point for the proposed CD 
lending elective goals. As noted above, 
use of these measures is consistent with 
approved strategic plans and the OCC’s 
overall experience in evaluating 
community banks’ CRA performance. In 
addition, use of these measures would 
adjust a community bank’s elective 
goals as the value of these measures 
change over time, consistent with the 
regulatory requirement that banks 
specify annual interim measurable goals 
in multi-year strategic plans. However, 
an elective goal expressed as a 
percentage of T1 capital or total assets 
may not provide the level of certainty 
and predictability preferred by many 
community banks interested in the 
strategic plan option. Community banks 
would therefore have the option of 
converting the percentage-based elective 
goal into an annual dollar figure. 
Elective goals expressed as an annual 
dollar figure would be determined based 
on a target percentage of a bank’s T1 
capital or total assets as of December 31 
of the previous year for (1) each year in 
the strategic plan term; (2) the first year 
of the strategic plan term and increased 
by 5 percent year-over-year for each 
subsequent year in the strategic plan 
term; or (3) the first year of the strategic 
plan term and increased by the annual 
change in Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) as of December 31 of the previous 
year for each subsequent year in the 
strategic plan term. 
A community bank would consider its 
circumstances to determine whether to 
convert a percentage-based CD lending 
goal into a dollar-based CD lending goal 
and, if applicable, the method of 
conversion and applicable growth rate. 
For example, a community bank that 
anticipates having stable levels of T1 
capital or total assets may determine 
that a percentage-based CD lending goal 
offers sufficient certainty without the 
potential to inadvertently increase the 
bank’s annual goals more than what is 
reasonable based on the bank’s capacity 
and constraints. If that community bank 
nonetheless prefers the certainty of 
dollar-based goals, it could specify a 
dollar-based elective goal that would 
convert the percent of T1 capital or total 
assets to a dollar amount based on the 
value of the respective measure as of 
December 31 of the prior calendar year 
for each year in the strategic plan term. 
In contrast, a community bank that 
anticipates rapid asset growth may elect 
to use a dollar-based elective goal with 
a five percent annual growth rate, or a 
growth rate based on the annual change 
in GDP, as described above.

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with PROPOSALS59751 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Proposed Rules 61
See supra note 14. 
62
In meeting goals in the broader statewide or 
regional area that includes a community bank’s 
assessment area, the OCC would consider CD 
activities consistent with the guidance in Q&As 
§§ll12(h)–6 and ll.12(h)–7. 63
Under the CRA regulation, a retail lending goal 
would be a goal focused on home mortgage loans, 
small business loans, small farm loans, or one or 
more types of consumer loans (i.e., motor vehicle loans, credit card loans, other secured consumer 
loans, or other unsecured consumer loans). See 12 CFR 25.22(a) (Mar. 29, 2024). 
Alternatively, a community bank could 
develop a custom goal that scales the 
annual dollar-based goal based on an 
alternate methodology or uses a 
different performance measure as the 
basis for the goal. For example, a 
community bank that is uncertain of its 
potential future growth could develop a 
custom goal requiring the bank to meet 
the lesser of a dollar based goal based 
on percent of T1 capital as of December 
31 of the previous year for the first year 
in the strategic plan term and a five 
percent annual growth rate or the actual 
percent of T1 capital as of December 31 
of the strategic plan year. 
The OCC is also proposing CD lending 
elective goals with a range of 
performance levels to account for the 
differences in community banks’ 
circumstances and the ways a 
community bank may incorporate CD 
lending elective goals into proposed 
strategic plans. As noted above, under 
the OCC’s current organizational 
structure, community banks are those 
with up to $30 billion in assets.
61
 
Therefore, outside of the strategic plan 
option, community banks would be 
evaluated under each of the otherwise 
applicable performance tests and 
standards depending on their size or 
type. For example, the OCC generally 
would evaluate a small community bank 
based only on its retail lending 
activities. This reflects community 
banks’ varying circumstances, including 
that certain community banks will have 
greater capacity, and therefore, generally 
higher performance expectations than 
other community banks. Varying 
performance expectations based on 
banks’ circumstances is consistent the 
OCC’s experience with approved 
strategic plans and evaluation under the 
otherwise applicable performance tests 
and standards. Some approved strategic 
plans focus on CD lending, while others 
focus on different or additional 
performance categories. For the reasons 
discussed above, the OCC specified 
several performance levels for the CD 
lending elective goals. A community 
bank would determine the performance 
level for its elective goals based on its 
performance context and the number 
and combination of measurable goals 
included in an assessment area and 
overall. 
The OCC also considered that certain 
community banks, particularly banks 
that operate through online platforms 
with limited branch networks, have 
elected the strategic plan option to 
address challenges with being evaluated 
pursuant to the otherwise applicable 
performance tests and standards. For 
some of these banks, limited 
opportunities and high competition can 
make it difficult to identify a sufficient 
level of CD activities that benefit or 
serve the bank’s assessment area. To 
address this issue, the proposed CD 
lending elective goals would include 
goals with performance measures for an 
assessment area coupled with 
performance measures for the broader 
statewide or regional area that includes 
the assessment area.
62
The assessment 
area performance levels proposed for 
these CD lending elective goals would 
be lower than for the assessment area- 
only CD lending elective goals. 
Questions: 
5. Are there additional elective goals 
for CD lending and qualified investment 
that the OCC should consider including 
in the simplified strategic plan process? 
For example, should the OCC consider 
developing deposit-based goals? 
6. Are the proposed CD lending 
elective goals appropriately calibrated 
for community banks? Do they provide 
appropriate optionality for community 
banks with different sizes and business 
models while providing clarity and 
simplifying a community bank’s 
strategic plan development? 
7. Should the OCC consider adding to 
the elective goals other methods of 
scaling the goals on an annual basis, 
such as a bank’s average annual asset 
growth? 
8. Is it appropriate to increase the 
performance expectations for 
community banks’ annual interim 
measurable goals over time? Are there 
circumstances under which goals 
should not increase? 
2. Retail Lending Goals 
In the OCC’s experience, in addition 
to CD lending goals, some banks also 
include retail lending goals when 
addressing the lending performance 
category in their strategic plans.
63
The 
OCC considered its supervisory 
experience and assessed options for 
providing retail lending elective goals 
with identified measures similar to the 
percentages of T1 capital and total 
assets identified for the proposed CD 
lending goals. Based on these 
considerations, the OCC is proposing to 
include three types of retail lending 
elective goals. These elective goals 
would be a measure of a bank’s loan 
portfolio comprised of originations or 
purchases to LMI borrowers or located 
in LMI geographies in a particular 
product line as compared to total 
originations or purchases based on (1) a 
percentage; (2) an aggregate dollar 
amount of loans; or (3) a specified 
number of loans. The OCC determined, 
however, that there is significant 
variation in banks’ retail lending 
activities due to bank and community 
specific performance context factors. 
This variation presents challenges for 
identifying specific performance levels 
that are generally reflective of 
‘‘Satisfactory’’ or ‘‘Outstanding’’ 
performance for community banks 
across assessment areas. Therefore, the 
proposed retail lending elective goals 
would be template-style goals with a 
variable that the community bank 
would populate. A community bank 
would determine whether to include 
one of the template-style retail lending 
elective goals and how to populate the 
variable included in the goal based on 
the bank’s performance context. 
In determining an appropriate 
performance level for a retail lending 
elective goal, a community bank could 
consider how the OCC assesses retail 
lending activities under the otherwise 
applicable performance tests and 
standards. For example, the OCC 
generally considers performance for the 
retail lending borrower and geographic 
distributions ‘‘Satisfactory’’ when a 
bank’s percentage of lending for a 
particular product type is near to or 
below, but not well below, the relevant 
comparator for the assessment area and 
‘‘Outstanding’’ when the percentage of 
lending equals or exceeds the 
demographic or peer comparator. 
However, the OCC determined that it 
may be challenging for a community 
bank to prospectively determine 
reasonable ‘‘Satisfactory’’ or 
‘‘Outstanding’’ performance levels for 
retail lending performance measures 
(i.e., percentage of an applicable retail loan portfolio, dollar amount of retail 
lending, or number of retail loans for a 
particular loan product) during the 
development of a strategic plan because 
the OCC does not assess a bank’s 
performance in relation to relevant 
comparators until the OCC conducts its 
CRA examination. During a CRA 
examination, the OCC’s assessment of a 
bank’s retail lending activities using the 
relevant comparators would consider 
performance context. In addition, some 
of the comparators that the OCC 
considers in assessing retail lending 
performance, such as the peer 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  21:20 Dec 19, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\22DEP1.SGM 22DEP1
tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with PROPOSALS59752 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Proposed Rules 64
See Q&A §ll.21(a)–3. comparators, are lagging and a 
community bank would not know the 
applicable comparator value during the 
development of a proposed strategic 
plan. For these reasons, the OCC 
determined that it may be challenging 
for a community bank to try to use the 
OCC’s CRA examination methods to 
determine reasonable values for the 
performance level variable in a retail 
lending elective goal. Therefore, a 
community bank could populate the 
performance level variable in a retail 
lending elective goal based on the 
bank’s prior retail lending performance 
which would have considered the 
relevant comparators. For a community 
bank that does not have a recent CRA 
examination that considered retail 
lending activities, the bank could 
determine an appropriate performance 
level based on the performance of peer 
banks. 
Generally, banks have specified 
product-specific retail lending goals. A 
community bank could choose to focus 
its retail lending goals on a primary 
product line or could specify 
measurable goals for multiple product 
lines. Therefore, the elective goals allow 
community banks to specify the 
applicable retail lending product or 
products as part of the performance 
measures. 
In addition to the retail lending 
elective goals, a community bank could 
specify one or more retail lending 
custom goals. A community bank 
considering a retail lending custom goal 
could base the goal on the performance 
criteria in the otherwise applicable 
performance tests and standards, such 
as lending activity or loan-to-deposit 
ratio. In the OCC’s supervisory 
experience, however, if a community 
bank were to specify a retail lending 
custom goal based on these performance 
criteria that goal generally would be 
insufficient on its own. Instead, this 
type of retail lending custom goal 
generally would be included to support 
other measurable goals. For example, a 
small community bank that develops a 
proposed strategic plan focused on retail 
lending may choose to include a retail 
lending custom goal focused on lending 
activity to demonstrate that it is lending 
commensurate with its capacity and 
provide context for retail lending 
elective goals focused on lending to LMI 
individuals or geographies in a 
particular product line. 
Custom goals could also be related to 
innovative, flexible, or responsive 
lending products, such as a goal for new 
loan originations in products tailored to 
meet the needs of LMI borrowers (e.g., 
X number loans originated with down- 
payment assistance for first-time 
homebuyers, with an annual increase 
using the current number of loan 
originations as the starting point). 
Lastly, a custom retail lending goal 
could be designed to address the unique 
needs of a bank’s assessment area, such 
as a retail lending goal targeting 
borrowers in distressed or underserved 
non-metropolitan middle-income 
geographies in an assessment area with 
no or few LMI census tracts or a goal 
targeting middle-income borrowers in 
high-cost areas. 
For smaller retail community banks, a 
proposed strategic plan focused solely 
on one or more retail lending elective 
goals or custom goals may be sufficient 
for evaluating the bank’s CRA 
performance (i.e., the community bank would not specify measurable goals in 
other performance categories). 
Specifically, a strategic plan focused on 
retail lending activities would be 
consistent with the small bank 
performance standards. In this instance, 
the community bank would include in 
this proposed strategic plan one or more 
retail lending elective goals or custom 
goals for each assessment area covered 
by the proposed strategic plan. In 
addition, the community bank would 
address in its proposed strategic plan 
the performance categories not included 
in the proposed strategic plan by 
explaining the performance context that 
supports the narrower focus. 
Larger community banks could 
consider including one or more retail 
lending elective goals, or retail lending 
custom goals, along with measurable 
goals in other performance categories, as 
appropriate, based on the banks’ 
circumstances. The OCC’s supervisory 
experience indicates that when larger 
community banks that offer mortgage, 
small business, small farm, or consumer 
lending product lines specify retail 
lending goals, they do so alongside goals 
focused on other types of CRA- 
qualifying activities. Moreover, given 
the flexibility offered by the strategic 
plan option, a community bank would 
not be required to establish retail 
lending measurable goals if a different 
focus was more appropriate based on 
the bank’s performance context. 
Questions: 
9. Should borrower and geographic 
retail lending elective goals include an 
undefined variable that a community 
bank would populate based on its 
performance context, as proposed, or 
should the OCC include the unadjusted 
near to/below percentage as a default 
starting point that banks could adjust 
based on performance context? 
10. Are there any other retail lending 
goals that the OCC should include as 
elective goals? 
ii. Investment Performance Category, 
Including Combined Measurable Goals 
In addition to the CD lending 
measurable goals discussed above, in 
the OCC’s experience, proposed 
strategic plans usually include 
measurable goals for qualified 
investments. As with the lending 
performance category, the OCC 
considered measurable goals for the 
investment performance category 
included in approved strategic plans 
and the otherwise applicable 
performance tests and standards to 
inform its determination of the qualified 
investment elective goals in this 
proposal. Based on this review, the OCC 
is proposing qualified investment 
elective goals that use the same 
performance measures and growth 
adjustment methods as the OCC used for 
the CD lending elective goals. However, 
the OCC’s review of approved strategic 
plans and its experience in evaluating 
community banks’ CRA performance 
resulted in the OCC proposing 
performance levels for certain qualified 
investment elective goals that are lower 
than the proposed CD lending elective 
goals due, for example, to frequent 
challenges smaller community banks 
experience competing for qualified 
investments. 
During its review of approved 
strategic plans, the OCC also recognized 
that banks often use the flexibility 
provided by the strategic plan option to 
specify CD lending and qualified 
investment combined goals. These 
combined goals help banks manage their 
CRA programs by allowing the banks to 
determine what types of CRA-qualifying 
activities to engage in based on 
opportunities available during the 
strategic plan term. This flexibility may 
be particularly useful for banks in 
assessment areas with high competition 
or limited opportunities. As such, the 
elective goals include combined goals 
for CD lending and qualified 
investments. 
The OCC also recognized that due to 
business strategy or market constraints, 
among other factors, certain community 
banks may want to focus on highly 
impactful activities, even if those 
activities have a lower relative dollar 
value. In evaluating banks’ CRA 
performance, the responsiveness of a 
bank’s CD activities is an important 
consideration.
64
For that reason, the 
proposed elective goals also include 
goals that would have lower overall 
performance levels provided that 50 
percent of the activity would be 
allocated to high impact activities, such 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  21:20 Dec 19, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\22DEP1.SGM 22DEP1
tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with PROPOSALS59753 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Proposed Rules 65
Depending on the size of the community bank, 
a services custom goal focused on one of these types 
of activities may be considered a CD services or 
retail services custom goal. See Q&A §ll.26(c)(3)—1. 66
See 12 CFR part 25, Appendix A, paragraph (e) (Mar. 29, 2024).

See id. 
68

69
See 12 CFR 25.27(f)(4) (Mar. 29, 2024). as donations or complex or innovative 
investments. 
Question: 
11. Should the OCC consider 
including an elective goal based on the 
percentage of qualified investments that 
are highly impactful, such as grants or 
donations? 
12. Are the proposed qualified 
investment elective goals and combined 
elective goals appropriately calibrated 
for community banks? Do they provide 
appropriate optionality for community 
banks with different sizes and business 
models while providing clarity and 
simplifying a community bank’s 
strategic plan development? 
iii. Services Performance Category 
The third performance category that 
banks may specify measurable goals for 
in their strategic plans is services. The 
OCC considered the types of services- 
related measurable goals included in 
approved strategic plans and the criteria 
the OCC has used for evaluating retail 
banking and CD services under the 
otherwise applicable performance tests 
and standards, along with the guidance 
on CD service activities in the Q&As. 
Based on this information, the OCC 
determined that the number of CD 
services hours per full-time employee 
per year is a common performance 
measure used for assessing banks’ CD 
services performance. As such, the OCC 
included in the simplified strategic plan 
process a proposed elective goal based 
on this performance measure. The OCC 
notes that these proposed services 
elective goals are most appropriate for 
banks operating in assessment areas 
using a branch-based model. If a 
community bank’s assessment area has 
a disproportionately large or small 
number of full-time employees, these 
proposed elective goals may not be 
appropriate for the bank. In those 
circumstances, a community bank could 
consider developing a CD services 
custom goal. For example, if a 
community bank has a large back-office 
facility in an assessment area that 
employs a significant number of full- 
time employees conducting functions 
that other banks may outsource, the 
community bank may consider a custom 
CD services goal based on hours per 
management employee. A CD services 
custom goal of this type would likely 
have a higher performance level than 
per employee elective goals. 
Alternatively, a bank with few 
employees may develop a CD services 
custom goal based, for example, on the 
number of beneficiaries of its CD 
services, as opposed to the hours per 
employee providing the services. 
In addition to goals for CD services 
measured by volunteer hours, banks 
have included other services goals based 
on the number of new accounts opened 
that are tailored to the needs of LMI 
individuals. A bank could develop a 
services custom goal based on one of 
these activities. For guidance on the 
types of service activities that a 
community bank could use as the basis 
for a services custom goal, banks could 
consider the services listed in Q&A 
§ll.26(c)(3)—1. These include (l) low-cost deposit accounts; (2) electronic 
benefit transfer accounts and point of 
sale terminal systems; (3) individual 
development accounts; (4) free or low- 
cost government, payroll, or other check 
cashing services; and (5) reasonably 
priced international remittance services. 
A bank’s custom goals for these types of 
activities could account for 
demographic factors and the bank’s 
current provision of the service.
65
 
Question: 
13. Should the OCC include other 
elective goals for services based on 
alternate measures in the simplified 
strategic plan process? If so, how should 
the OCC identify ‘‘Satisfactory’’ or ‘‘Outstanding’’ performance for those goals? 
C. Strategic Plan Assessment and Rating 
The OCC assesses the performance of 
a bank operating under an approved 
strategic plan to determine if it has met 
the measurable goals in its strategic 
plan. The CRA regulation provides that 
the OCC will rate a bank ‘‘Satisfactory’’ 
if it substantially achieves its plan goals 
for a ‘‘Satisfactory’’ rating.
66
The CRA 
regulation further provides that the OCC 
will rate a bank ‘‘Outstanding’’ if it 
exceeds its plan goals for a 
‘‘Satisfactory’’ rating and substantially 
achieves its plan goals for an 
‘‘Outstanding’’ rating.
67
A bank that 
does not substantially meet its 
‘‘Satisfactory’’ goals in an assessment 
area would be rated ‘‘Needs to Improve’’ 
or ‘‘Substantial Noncompliance,’’ 
depending on the extent to which it falls 
short of its plan goals, unless the bank 
elected to be evaluated under the 
otherwise applicable performance tests 
and standards.
68
 
In general, a bank would be 
considered to have substantially met its 
measurable goals if the bank meets most 
of the goals specified in its strategic 
plan in most of its assessment areas, 
considering (1) the extent to which the 
bank did not meet individual goals; (2) 
the importance of those goals to the plan 
as a whole; and (3) any performance 
context factors explaining why a 
particular goal was not met. The OCC 
generally considers a ‘‘Needs to 
Improve’’ rating for a bank that 
substantially meets some measurable 
goals in most assessment areas. A 
community bank that more significantly 
underperforms its measurable goals or 
fails to substantially meet its goals two 
evaluation periods in a row may receive 
a rating of ‘‘Substantial 
Noncompliance.’’ As provided in the 
CRA regulation, a community bank 
could also elect evaluation under the 
otherwise applicable performance tests 
and standards if its ‘‘Satisfactory’’ goals 
were not substantially met.
69
If this 
substitute election is not made in the 
community bank’s strategic plan, the 
OCC would evaluate the bank only 
under the measurable goals provided in 
the strategic plan. 
For community banks with multiple 
measurable goals or assessment areas, 
the OCC is also considering including in 
the Simplified Strategic Plan Form 
fields that would allow a community 
bank to specify how its performance 
with respect to its measurable goals and 
in its assessment areas would be 
weighted to determine if the bank has 
substantially met or exceeded the 
‘‘Satisfactory’’ goals in its strategic plan. 
This weighting could be based, for 
example, on the bank’s deposit market 
share, lending market share, or a 
combination of the two. Weighting 
could also account for assessment area 
needs and opportunities. Providing this 
option would increase predictability for 
community banks by establishing in the 
plan how the OCC would determine if 
a bank substantially met is measurable 
goals. Further, it would be consistent 
with certain previously approved 
strategic plans. 
Question: 
14. Should the OCC include the 
option for banks to specify a 
methodology for weighting measurable 
goals included in the proposed strategic 
plan? If so, should the Simplified 
Strategic Plan Form, discussed below, 
provide options for weighting 
methodologies? What methodologies 
should the OCC consider? 
D. Simplified Strategic Plan Process 
In addition to providing clearer 
guidance on the development of a 
proposed strategic plan, the simplified

Plan Form. in.

on CRA-Related Regulatory Burden and the 
Strategic Plan Option). 
strategic plan process would provide 
community banks with a streamlined 
process for drafting proposed strategic 
plans and submitting those plans to the 
OCC for approval. This proposed 
simplified strategic plan process would 
reduce the complexity involved in 
developing a proposed strategic plan by 
improving transparency and leveraging 
tools and technology, as appropriate. 
First, the OCC would implement 
process improvements to the strategic 
plan consultation process to formalize 
its existing practice of engaging in more 
detailed strategic plan consultations. 
Next, the OCC would provide 
community banks with the Simplified 
Strategic Plan Form to clarify the 
information a community bank must 
include in its proposed strategic plan to 
comply with the CRA regulation.
70
As a 
result, the simplified strategic plan 
process would help limit the instances 
in which a community bank 
unnecessarily expends resources by 
gathering and including information in 
a proposed strategic plan that the OCC 
does not need for purposes of evaluating 
the merits of the plan. The combination 
of improved written guidance, tools, 
and procedures for developing and 
requesting approval of a proposed 
strategic plan would result in a 
simplified process requiring fewer bank 
resources during plan development, and 
a more predictable evaluation 
framework once the OCC approves a 
community bank’s proposed strategic 
plan. 
i. Simplified Strategic Plan Process 
Consultation 
As provided in the current guidance, 
including the Q&As, a community bank 
may consult the OCC during the 
development of a proposed strategic 
plan. The OCC has engaged in strategic 
plan consultations since first 
introducing the strategic plan option in 
the 1995 CRA Regulation; however, the 
current consultation process envisions a 
high-level interaction where the OCC 
would only provide guidance on the 
procedures and information necessary 
to ensure a complete submission.
71
The 
current guidance on strategic plan 
consultations states that the OCC does 
not provide guidance on the adequacy 
of the proposed strategic plan or the 
merits of the measurable goals.
72
 
As discussed above, the OCC has 
learned over time that the high-level 
consultation process envisioned in the 
guidance does not provide many banks 
with sufficient direction to develop a 
proposed strategic plan that meets the 
requirements of the regulation without 
undue burden. For this reason, and at 
banks’ request, the OCC has in practice 
reviewed draft strategic plans as part of 
this consultation, including with respect 
to proposed measurable goals. 
Although optional, in the OCC’s 
experience, the consultation process is 
one factor that has contributed 
significantly to the protracted timeframe 
and burden associated with developing 
and obtaining approval of a strategic 
plan, and to banks deciding not to 
pursue the strategic plan option in the 
first instance. To address these 
deficiencies, the OCC would improve 
the consultation process by clarifying 
that the agency would provide a 
community bank with timely, initial 
feedback on the adequacy of its 
proposed strategic plan and the merits 
of the proposed measurable goals 
considering the bank’s performance 
context. This feedback would not 
constitute OCC approval of a strategic 
plan. The OCC would approve a 
proposed strategic plan submitted using 
the simplified strategic plan process 
after considering the regulatory criteria 
for evaluating a proposed strategic plan 
that has complied with the required 
public comment process. 
Under the simplified strategic plan 
process, the OCC’s consultation process 
would include providing guidance to a 
community bank on the measurable 
goals it intends to specify in its 
proposed strategic plan. As discussed 
above, however, the elective goals are 
not safe harbors and community banks 
would still need to consider the 
appropriate number, combination, 
represented performance categories, and 
appropriate performance levels of 
elective goals, and custom goals, for 
each assessment area included in the 
strategic plan and based on the bank’s 
performance context. The purpose of the 
consultation would be to help the 
community bank understand the 
requirements of the regulation, what 
information is responsive to those 
regulatory requirements, how to 
consider performance context in 
selecting and supporting elective goals 
or developing custom goals, and how 
the OCC applies the regulation’s criteria 
for evaluating a strategic plan once a 
plan is submitted for approval following 
the public comment process. 
In the OCC’s experience, the 
consultation process is an informal 
opportunity for a community bank to 
engage with the OCC; the extent and 
length of a consultation is dictated by 
the bank and is only necessary if it 
benefits the bank. The OCC expects that 
the more detailed written guidance 
provided as part of the proposed 
simplified strategic plan process, 
including clarifications related to the 
required content of a proposed strategic 
plan, along with a more streamlined 
process for drafting and submitting the 
plan to the OCC, will focus and shorten 
these strategic plan consultations. For 
example, a community bank that 
primarily selects elective goals would 
likely engage in a relatively short 
consultation process. However, a 
community bank that specifies more 
custom goals may need a more extensive 
consultation to help determine if the 
performance measures and performance 
levels in the custom goals are 
appropriate and fully supported. 
ii. Simplified Strategic Plan Form 
The proposed simplified strategic 
plan process would further reduce 
burden by introducing the Simplified 
Strategic Plan Form, which would 
remove some of the subjectivity 
associated with the development of a 
strategic plan. Under the current 
process, banks that wish to use the 
strategic plan option need to draft fully 
custom strategic plans with little 
guidance on the necessary content, 
reasonableness of measurable goals, 
design, or level of detail necessary for a 
complete proposed plan. 
The OCC understands from comments 
provided in other contexts
73
that the 
considerable resources currently 
required to develop a proposed strategic 
plan have deterred banks from electing 
the strategic plan option. The OCC 
anticipates that changing the method 
community banks may use to submit 
proposed strategic plans to the OCC 
would substantially improve the quality 
of proposed strategic plans while 
diminishing the need to revise these 
plans to ensure completeness. In 
particular, the Simplified Strategic Plan 
Form would contain fields for all of the 
information required in a strategic plan 
under the CRA regulation, including 
measurable goals, relevant performance 
context, public participation 
documentation, proposed effective date, 
substitute election of evaluation under 
the otherwise applicable performance 
tests and standards, and assessment 
areas covered by the plan. Presuming a 
bank completes all fields that address 
CRA regulatory requirements with 
responsive information, the OCC would 
expect that submitted proposed strategic 
plans would be complete. In limited 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  21:20 Dec 19, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\22DEP1.SGM 22DEP1
tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with PROPOSALS59755 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Proposed Rules 74
Under the simplified strategic plan process, the 
OCC would streamline the information that 
community banks provide to document their 
compliance with the strategic plan provision where 
possible. For example, a community bank using the 
simplified strategic plan process would certify its 
compliance with the public participation 
requirements of the strategic plan provision but 
would not be required to submit the notices used 
for compliance. The OCC may validate compliance 
with the newspaper publication requirements in the 
course of reviewing a proposed strategic plan, as 
appropriate. 
circumstances, the OCC may require a 
community bank to submit additional 
information not required by the 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form that the 
OCC deems necessary to make a 
determination on the strategic plan. 
The OCC is also considering using 
technology, where possible, to simplify 
the strategic plan approval request 
process. Specifically, the OCC is 
considering options for community 
banks to submit a completed Simplified 
Strategic Plan Form electronically via 
email or through Banknet. If the OCC 
decides to utilize Banknet for 
submission of the Simplified Strategic 
Plan Form, the OCC would provide 
community banks that do not have 
Banknet with the opportunity to submit 
the form by email using the subject line 
‘‘CRA Simplified Strategic Plan Form.’’ 
The OCC is also considering different 
potential formats for developing the 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form. The 
OCC is considering the following 
options: (1) a fillable Portable Document 
Format (PDF) and (2) an interactive 
web-based form. In considering the 
merits of these options, the OCC is 
weighing the tradeoff between providing 
more immediate but less sophisticated 
improvements through the PDF option 
compared with the more sophisticated 
and dynamic web-based option, which 
would require a longer implementation 
time horizon. While the OCC could 
implement the less sophisticated PDF 
option quickly, converting information 
in a fillable PDF form into a proposed 
strategic plan would require a manual 
process on the part of the OCC or the 
community bank. In contrast, the more 
sophisticated web-based option could 
leverage technology to convert the 
contents of the form into a proposed 
strategic plan. To balance these 
considerations, the OCC could take a 
combined approach and implement the 
simplified strategic plan process 
through the less sophisticated PDF 
option first and later replace it with the 
more sophisticated and agile web-based 
option. 
The OCC is also considering ways to 
streamline the development of 
subsequent strategic plans once the term 
of a community bank’s strategic plan 
ends. One option would be to allow a 
bank that previously received approval 
for a strategic plan using the simplified 
strategic plan process to prepopulate the 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form with the 
contents of its prior strategic plan and 
then modify the prepopulated 
information, as appropriate. The 
viability of this option would depend on 
the format used for implementing the 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form. 
Included in appendix B to this 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATIONis an 
outline of the potential fields that would 
be included in the Simplified Strategic 
Plan Form. 
Questions: 
15. Does the outline of the potential 
fields for the Simplified Strategic Plan 
Form appropriately reflect the 
components of a proposed strategic 
plan? Are any additions or 
modifications necessary? 
16. Should the OCC prioritize 
providing more immediate or more 
sophisticated implementation? 
17. If the OCC implements the 
guidance using a fillable PDF form, 
should the OCC also develop a template 
for converting the information in the 
form into a strategic plan? 
18. Would prepopulating the 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form with the 
information contained in previously 
approved plans help to further simplify 
the strategic plan process in the future? 
iii. Proposed Strategic Plan Receipt and 
Acknowledgement 
After completing both the Simplified 
Strategic Plan Form and the required 
public engagement, a community bank 
would submit its proposed strategic 
plan to the OCC for approval. Upon 
receipt of a Simplified Strategic Plan 
Form, the OCC would review the plan, 
and if complete, send an 
acknowledgment of receipt to the bank. 
The OCC would deem a request 
complete if the bank has populated all 
required fields of the Simplified 
Strategic Plan Form with responsive 
information, including any necessary 
supporting documentation.
74
For 
incomplete proposed strategic plans, the 
OCC would request that the community 
bank complete the necessary fields on 
the Simplified Strategic Plan Form and 
resubmit the form to the OCC. A 
community bank should expeditiously 
communicate material changes to 
information initially furnished in the 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form to the 
OCC during the processing of a 
community bank’s request for approval. 
The OCC would determine whether to 
approve a proposed strategic plan by 
considering the information provided by 
the community bank in the Simplified 
Strategic Plan Form. This evaluation 
would consider whether to approve the 
elective goals or custom goals, as 
applicable, based on the criteria 
provided in the CRA regulation. As 
necessary, the OCC may consider 
information regarding a community 
bank’s performance context that was not 
provided by the bank in the Simplified 
Strategic Plan Form. 
iv. Strategic Plan Regulatory 
Requirements and Case-Specific Waiver 
Requests 
As noted above, in addition to 
measurable goals, the strategic plan 
option includes certain other regulatory 
requirements. These include 
requirements related to: (1) the 
proposed effective date; (2) data 
reporting; (3) public engagement; (4) 
substitute election of evaluation under 
the otherwise applicable performance 
tests and standards; and (5) plan 
amendment. The simplified strategic 
plan process would incorporate these 
requirements and any other necessary 
information into the Simplified 
Strategic Plan Form. As discussed 
above, the OCC is also considering 
providing fields in the Simplified 
Strategic Plan Form that would allow 
the bank to specify how performance 
would be weighted in and across its 
assessment areas to determine if the 
bank has substantially met or exceeded 
its ‘‘Satisfactory’’ or ‘‘Outstanding’’ 
goals, as applicable. 
The simplified strategic plan process 
would provide guidance on the 
regulatory requirements that is generally 
consistent with the existing guidelines 
in OCC Bulletin 2019–39, with one 
notable difference. Specifically, the 
simplified strategic plan process would 
modify the information required to 
document a community bank’s 
compliance with the CRA regulation’s 
public participation requirements to 
require a certification of compliance 
rather than documentation of 
newspaper publication. In addition, the 
OCC has recognized during its past 
review and approval of strategic plans 
that there may be instances where it 
would be reasonable to waive certain 
regulatory requirements on a case-by- 
case basis. 
1. Case-by-Case Waiver of Certain 
Regulatory Requirements 
The OCC has determined that, in 
certain instances, it may be appropriate 
to waive the strategic plan provision’s 
proposed effective date requirement or 
certain data requirements based on a 
community bank’s particular facts and 
circumstances. For the remaining 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  21:20 Dec 19, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\22DEP1.SGM 22DEP1
tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with PROPOSALS59756 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Proposed Rules 75
Under the CRA regulation, a bank is not 
evaluated under a strategic plan until the bank has 
been operating under an approved and effective 
strategic plan for at least one year. See 12 CFR 25.27(a) (Mar. 29, 2024). 
76
The strategic plan provision provides that 
electing the strategic plan option does not affect a 
bank’s or savings association’s obligation, if any, to 
report data as required under the CRA regulation. 
77
The strategic plan option includes two public 
participation requirements. First, a bank must seek 
informal suggestions from members of the public in 
its assessment areas covered by the plan while 
developing the plan and describe its efforts to seek 
suggestions in its proposed strategic plan. See 12 CFR 25.27(d)(1) and (e) (Mar. 29, 2024). Second, a 
bank must: (1) formally solicit public comment on 
the plan for at least 30 days by publishing notice 
in at least one newspaper of general circulation in 
each assessment area covered by the plan and (2) 
submit with its proposed strategic plan any written 
public comment received, and, if the plan was 
revised in light of the comment received, the initial 
plan as released for public comment. See 12 CFR 25.27(d)(2) and (e) (Mar. 29, 2024). 
78
12 CFR 25.27(g)(3) (Mar. 29, 2024). 
79
12 CFR 25.27(g)(1) (Mar. 29, 2024). 
regulatory requirements, the OCC has 
determined that waiver generally would 
not be inappropriate. 
Under the simplified strategic plan 
process, on a case-by-case basis, the 
OCC would consider waiving the 
requirement that a community bank 
submit its proposed strategic plan to the 
OCC for approval at least three months 
prior to the proposed effective date
75
if 
a strategic plan has been deemed 
complete and the OCC would have 
sufficient time to review and opine on 
the plan. Based on the OCC’s 
experience, it may be appropriate to 
waive the proposed effective date 
requirement if it would allow the bank 
to: (1) align the effective date of its 
strategic plan with the beginning of a 
performance year (i.e., a January 1st effective date); (2) avoid a gap between 
approved strategic plan terms; or (3) 
address other circumstances deemed 
relevant by the OCC. The OCC has also 
determined that it may be appropriate to 
waive certain of the CRA regulation’s 
data reporting requirements
76
on a case- 
by-case basis if those data are not 
necessary for evaluating the measurable 
goals included in a community bank’s 
proposed strategic plan. For example, 
the OCC may consider waiving the 
small business and small farm data 
collection and reporting requirements if 
a community bank has not included a 
retail lending goal in its strategic plan. 
The OCC notes, however, that it 
generally would be inappropriate for a 
community bank to develop a strategic 
plan that does not include measurable 
goals for lending products that are 
integral to the bank’s business strategy 
in order to seek waiver of the associated 
data requirements. 
The OCC believes that waiver may be 
appropriate, on a case-by-case basis, 
when: (1) a regulatory requirement is for 
the benefit of the OCC (e.g., the three month lead time for the proposed 
effective date provides time for the OCC 
to review a proposed strategic plan) and 
(2) waiving the requirement would have 
minimal impact on the OCC’s ability to 
evaluate the bank pursuant to the 
strategic plan, if approved. For example, 
a waiver would have minimal impact on 
the OCC’s ability to evaluate a bank 
pursuant to a proposed strategic plan if 
the data that the bank was exempted 
from collecting and reporting would not 
be considered in evaluating the bank’s 
measurable goals or the bank’s 
performance under the otherwise 
applicable performance tests and 
standards for a bank that chose the 
substitute election. If the OCC were to 
decide to grant a waiver, the OCC would 
communicate that decision to the 
community bank in writing. The OCC 
believes it is appropriate to consider 
case-specific waivers to minimize the 
impact of regulatory requirements that 
impose unnecessary burden on 
community banks. 
2. Compliance With Public Participation 
Requirements 
Under the simplified strategic plan 
process, community banks would 
continue to be required to comply with 
the public participation requirements.
77
 
In determining whether to approve a 
proposed strategic plan, the OCC will 
consider any public comments and how 
the community bank addressed those 
comments. Obtaining information from 
the public when developing a strategic 
plan helps to provide a community bank 
with information related to the lending, 
investment, and service needs of its 
community and the opportunities 
available to meet those needs. 
Compliance with the strategic plan 
provision’s public participation 
requirements is important to the OCC’s 
decision on a strategic plan. To facilitate 
this public engagement, the Simplified 
Strategic Plan Form would be 
completed in two stages. The first stage 
would generate a draft plan for use in 
soliciting public comment in the 
required newspapers of general 
circulation. At the end of the comment 
period, the community bank would 
complete the second stage of the 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form by 
revising the plan as appropriate and 
completing the certification of 
compliance with the public comment 
process, which would include providing 
a list of the newspapers that published 
the plan for comment and the dates of 
publication. The community bank 
would then submit the proposed 
strategic plan to the OCC for approval. 
v. OCC Strategic Plan Review and 
Approval 
In evaluating a community bank’s 
proposed strategic plan, the OCC would 
apply the evaluation criteria provided in 
the regulation.
78
The strategic plan 
provision requires the OCC to act on a 
plan within 60 days of receiving a 
complete plan or else the plan is 
deemed approved.
79
When possible, the 
OCC would aim to act within 45 days 
of receiving a complete strategic plan, 
provided there are at least 45 days 
before the plan’s proposed effective 
date. 
E. Existing Guidance 
The guidance and process changes 
included in the simplified strategic plan 
process would supplement the OCC’s 
existing guidance on the strategic plan 
process contained in OCC Bulletin 
2019–39, as applicable. Community 
banks may continue to develop strategic 
plans using the guidance in OCC 
Bulletin 2019–39 or may elect to use the 
proposed simplified strategic plan 
process. 
III. Request for Comment 
The OCC invites comment on all 
aspects of the proposed simplified 
strategic plan process for community 
banks. In addition, the OCC specifically 
request commenters’ views on the 
questions included in this 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. 
IV. Regulatory Analysis 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
This supplemental proposed guidance 
(proposed guidance) has been reviewed 
for compliance with the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 
3501 et seq.). In accordance with the PRA, the OCC may not conduct or 
sponsor, and an organization is not 
required to respond to, an information 
collection unless the information 
collection displays a currently valid 
Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) control number. The OCC has 
reviewed the proposed guidance and 
has determined that certain aspects of 
the proposed guidance constitute a 
collection of information and is 
therefore revising its information 
collection titled Community 
Reinvestment Act. The OMB control 
number for the information collection is 
1557–0357. The OCC is proposing to 
extend the information collection for 
three years, with revision.

under an approved strategic plan. The 
strategic plan provision requires a bank 
seeking to use the strategic plan option 
to develop its plan in consultation with 
members of the public, publish the plan 
for public comment, and include in the 
plan annual interim measurable goals. 
The strategic plan provision further 
provides the regulatory requirements 
that a bank must comply with when 
electing the strategic plan option and 
the OCC’s criteria for evaluating a 
strategic plan. 
The proposed guidance would make 
the strategic plan option more accessible 
and less burdensome for community 
banks to implement and does not 
impose any new requirements on 
community banks. The proposed 
simplified strategic plan process would 
serve as an optional resource for 
community banks that clarifies the 
requirements of the strategic plan option 
and streamlines the development and 
submission of a proposed strategic plan. 
The reporting requirements in the 
proposed guidance are as follows: 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form 
Under the proposed guidance, the 
OCC would provide community banks 
with a Simplified Strategic Plan Form to 
clarify the information that a 
community bank must include in its 
proposed strategic plan in order to 
comply with the CRA regulation. The 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form would 
include fields for all information 
required for a strategic plan under the 
CRA regulation, including measurable 
goals, relevant performance context, 
public participation documentation, 
proposed effective date, substitute 
election of evaluation under the 
otherwise applicable performance tests 
and standards, and assessment areas 
covered by the plan. 
Presuming a bank completes all fields 
that address CRA regulatory 
requirements with responsive 
information, the OCC expects that 
submitted proposed strategic plans 
would be complete. In limited 
circumstances, the OCC may require a 
community bank to submit additional 
information not required by the 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form to 
disposition the merits of the strategic 
plan. 
Annual Interim Measurable Goals 
The current CRA regulation provides 
that a bank’s strategic plan must specify 
annual interim measurable goals that 
constitute ‘‘Satisfactory’’ performance 
for each assessment area covered by the 
plan. These goals must address all three 
performance categories and, if a bank is 
not designated as a wholesale or limited 
purpose bank, must emphasize lending 
and lending-related activities. The 
proposed guidance provides that a 
community bank should include in its 
proposed strategic plan lending, 
investment, and services measurable 
goals, as appropriate. Under the 
proposed guidance a community bank 
would also have the option to 
emphasize qualified investments or 
service activities, if appropriate. To 
determine the appropriate performance 
categories to specify measurable goals 
for and which to emphasize in its 
proposed strategic plan, a community 
bank would consider the credit needs of 
its community, public comments, and 
its performance context, particularly the 
bank’s capacity and constraints, 
business strategy, and product offerings. 
Community banks’ proposed strategic 
plans would also need to provide 
performance context addressing 
performance categories for which the 
banks did not specify a measurable goal. 
Using the simplified strategic plan 
process, a community bank would 
specify ‘‘Satisfactory’’ elective goals or 
custom goals for each performance 
category, as appropriate, in its proposed 
strategic plan for each year and 
assessment area included in the plan. In 
addition to ‘‘Satisfactory’’ measurable 
goals, a community bank’s proposed 
strategic plan may also specify 
measurable goals that constitute an 
‘‘Outstanding’’ level of performance. 
Community banks also have the option 
to specify ‘‘Outstanding’’ custom goals. 
The proposed guidance offers that a 
community bank should consider 
community needs and its performance 
context (e.g., its capacity and constraints, business strategy, and 
product offerings) when specifying 
elective or custom goals in its proposed 
strategic plan. 
Plan Amendment 
A bank may request approval of an 
amendment to an approved strategic 
plan if there is a material change in 
circumstances (e.g., a downturn in the economic environment, a shift in the 
bank’s business strategy, or entrance 
into or exit from one or more assessment 
areas). Public participation is required 
in the development of an amendment to 
a previously approved strategic plan. To 
request approval by the OCC of a 
strategic plan amendment, a bank 
should submit the amendment portion 
of the Simplified Strategic Plan Form.

V. Text of the Proposed Community 
Reinvestment Act Simplified Strategic 
Plan Process for Community Banks 
A. Summary 
The Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency (OCC) is issuing this guidance 
to inform national banks, Federal 
savings associations, and Federal 
branches of foreign banking 
organizations (collectively, banks) about 
supplemental guidance applicable to 
community banks
80
that are interested 
in electing to have the OCC assess their 
Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) 
performance under a strategic plan 
(strategic plan option).
81
Under the CRA 
regulation, any bank may elect to have 
the OCC assess its CRA performance 
under an approved strategic plan. The 
strategic plan option enables a bank to 
tailor its CRA examination based on the 
needs of its community and its ability 
to help address those needs based on its 
capacity and constraints, product 
offerings, and business strategy. The 
CRA regulation’s strategic plan 
provision requires a bank seeking to use 
the strategic plan option to develop its 
plan in consultation with members of 
the public, publish the plan for public 
comment, and include in the plan 
annual interim measurable goals. The 
strategic plan provision provides the: (1) 
regulatory requirements that a bank 
must comply with when electing the 
strategic plan option and (2) OCC’s 
criteria for evaluating a strategic plan. 
This guidance supplements the 
guidelines for requesting approval of a 
strategic plan included in OCC Bulletin 
2019–39, ‘‘Community Reinvestment 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  21:20 Dec 19, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\22DEP1.SGM 22DEP1

See 12 CFR 25.27(f)(1) (Mar. 29, 2024). 83
See id. 
84
See id. 
85
This explanation of the CRA strategic plan 
provision is consistent with the explanation 
provided in the 1994 CRA proposal preceding the 
1995 CRA regulation, which is substantively similar 
in relevant part to the CRA strategic plan provision 
that was ultimately included in the CRA regulation. 
See 59 FR 51232, 51242–51243 (Oct. 7, 1994); see also 12 CFR 25.27(f) (Mar. 29, 2024). 86
The OCC will assess whether a community 
bank has met the measurable goals in its strategic 
plan based on available data or other data obtained 
during the examination as provided in the plan. 
87
See 12 CFR 25.27(f)(3) (Mar. 29, 2024) 88
The OCC’s approval of a strategic plan would 
be provided only after the community bank were to 
undertake the required public engagement and 
adjust the proposed strategic plan to address public 
comments, as appropriate. 
89
See 12 CFR 25.27(f)(1) (Mar. 29, 2024). Act: Guidelines for Requesting Approval 
of a Strategic Plan.’’ This supplemental 
guidance helps clarify the OCC’s 
implementation of the CRA regulation’s 
strategic plan provision for community 
banks by outlining a simplified strategic 
plan process and providing additional 
guidance on the development of a 
proposed strategic plan for those banks. 
This supplemental guidance includes: 
DA Simplified Strategic Plan Form used to provide the OCC with 
DAnnual interim measurable goals for each assessment area included in the 
proposed strategic plan; and 
DOther information related to the bank’s proposed strategic plan. 
DThe OCC’s simplified strategic plan process and additional strategic plan 
guidance for community banks. 
This supplemental guidance is 
designed to make the strategic plan 
option more accessible to and less 
burdensome for community banks. This 
guidance does not impose any new 
requirements on community banks. The 
simplified strategic plan process is an 
optional resource for community banks 
that clarifies the requirements of the 
strategic plan option and streamlines 
the development and submission of a 
proposed strategic plan. Any bank 
interested in the strategic plan option 
may continue to follow the guidelines 
provided in OCC Bulletin 2019–39. 
B. Simplified Strategic Plan Process— 
Plan Development 
Measurable Goals 
The CRA regulation provides that a 
bank’s strategic plan must specify 
annual interim measurable goals that 
constitute ‘‘Satisfactory’’ performance 
for each assessment area covered by the 
plan.
82
Generally, these goals must 
address all three performance categories 
and, unless the bank has been 
designated as a wholesale or limited 
purpose bank, must emphasize lending 
and lending-related activities.
83
 
However, the CRA regulation also states 
that a different emphasis, including a 
focus on one or more performance 
categories, may be appropriate if 
responsive to the characteristics and 
credit needs of a bank’s assessment 
areas, considering public comment and 
the bank’s capacity and constraints, 
product offerings, and business 
strategy.
84
 
Consistent with the CRA regulation, a 
community bank should include in its 
proposed strategic plan lending, 
investment, and services measurable 
goals, as appropriate. A bank has great 
flexibility to fashion its proposed 
strategic plan within those parameters 
and would not be required to specify 
measurable goals in all three 
performance categories. Although the 
CRA regulation provides that a bank 
generally should emphasize lending and 
lending-related activities, a community 
bank would have the option to 
emphasize qualified investments or 
service activities, if appropriate. A bank 
would consider the credit needs of its 
community, public comments, and its 
performance context—in particular the 
bank’s capacity and constraints, 
business strategy, and product 
offerings—to determine the appropriate 
performance categories for which to 
specify measurable goals and emphasize 
in its proposed strategic plan.
85
The 
bank would also provide in its proposed 
strategic plan performance context 
addressing performance categories for 
which the bank did not specify a 
measurable goal. 
The OCC has determined that the 
‘‘Satisfactory’’ measurable goals
86
 
provided in the Simplified Strategic 
Plan Form (hereinafter, elective goals) generally are consistent with the OCC’s 
supervisory expectations for what 
constitutes a ‘‘Satisfactory’’ performance 
level for community banks, as discussed 
below. In addition to the elective goals, 
community banks also may request 
approval for ‘‘Satisfactory’’ custom 
goals. In developing a proposed strategic 
plan using the simplified strategic plan 
process, for each year and assessment 
area included in the plan, a community 
bank would specify ‘‘Satisfactory’’ 
elective goals or custom goals for each 
performance category, as appropriate. 
In addition to ‘‘Satisfactory’’ 
measurable goals, the CRA regulation 
provides that a bank’s strategic plan 
may specify measurable goals that 
constitute an ‘‘Outstanding’’ level of 
performance.
87
The Simplified Strategic 
Plan Form also includes elective goals 
that generally are consistent with the 
OCC’s supervisory expectations for what 
constitutes ‘‘Outstanding’’ performance 
for community banks, as discussed 
below. In addition, community banks 
have the option to specify 
‘‘Outstanding’’ custom goals. 
The OCC based the ‘‘Satisfactory’’ and 
‘‘Outstanding’’ elective goals on its 
supervisory experience. The elective 
goals reflect the performance measures 
and related performance levels for a 
community bank that the OCC 
determined may reflect ‘‘Satisfactory’’ or 
‘‘Outstanding’’ performance 
individually or in combination with 
other measurable goals, depending on 
the circumstances. The elective goals, 
however, are not safe harbors and their 
use would not guarantee approval of a 
strategic plan.
88
In specifying elective 
goals or custom goals in a proposed 
strategic plan, a community bank 
should consider community needs and 
its performance context (e.g., its capacity and constraints, business 
strategy, and product offerings).
89
 
A community bank’s performance 
context informs which measurable goals 
are appropriate for the bank overall or 
for an assessment area, including the 
number, combination, represented 
performance categories, and appropriate 
performance levels for those goals. 
Because the strategic plan option 
provides community banks with 
significant flexibility to tailor their CRA 
examination, the measurable goals will 
likely vary even when comparing two 
similarly situated banks. Based on the 
OCC’s supervisory experience, 
community banks may choose different 
variations of goals with different 
performance levels to tailor their CRA 
examinations based on the 
circumstances. Therefore, the elective 
goals include performance measures 
with several options for performance 
levels. Community banks also have the 
option to specify custom goals to use in 
combination with, or instead of, the 
elective goals. The appropriate 
performance levels for a community 
bank’s measurable goals would depend 
on the goals selected and the bank’s 
performance context. The Simplified 
Strategic Plan Form, discussed below, 
includes guidance that provides 
examples of when an elective goal may 
be appropriate for a community bank. 
For example, a community bank 
operating in an assessment area with 
extremely high competition for CD loans 
and qualified investments, may select 
an elective goal with a lower 
‘‘Satisfactory’’ performance level for the 
assessment area, and a related 
‘‘Satisfactory’’ performance level for the

See 12 CFR 25.27(d) (Mar. 29, 2024). A bank may comply with the requirement to make copies 
of its proposed strategic plan available for review 
by the public at its offices during the period of 
formal public comment by making a digital copy 
available for review. Unless a bank receives a 
request for a hardcopy of its proposed strategic 
plan, the bank may satisfy the requirement to 
provide a copy of the plan upon request by 
providing a downloadable digital version of its 
proposed strategic plan on its website.

Under the simplified strategic plan process, the 
OCC has streamlined the information that banks 
provide to document their compliance with the 
strategic plan provision where possible. For 
example, banks using the simplified strategic plan 
process must certify their compliance with the 
public participation requirements of the strategic 
plan provision but are not required to submit the 
notices or newspapers used for compliance. 
96
See 12 CFR 25.27(e) (Mar. 29, 2024). broader statewide or regional area that 
includes the assessment area. However, 
in an assessment area with less 
competition, a bank may select a higher 
‘‘Satisfactory’’ elective goal and include 
consideration of CRA-qualifying 
activities in the broader state-wide 
regional area in an ‘‘Outstanding’’ 
custom goal. In another example, a 
smaller community bank that is unable 
to compete for large, complex 
investments may opt for an elective goal 
focused on a lower volume of highly 
impactful qualified investments, such as 
grants and donations. Further, it may be 
appropriate for a small community bank 
that would otherwise be evaluated 
solely based on the small bank lending 
test (i.e., the community bank is a small bank that does not meet the definition 
of intermediate small bank) to specify 
elective goals related only to retail 
lending. 
Public Participation Requirements 
Under the simplified strategic plan 
process, community banks must comply 
with the public participation 
requirements of the CRA strategic plan 
provision.
90
To comply with the public 
participation requirements, a 
community bank would complete the 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form in two 
stages. A bank would complete the first 
stage of the form to develop a draft 
strategic plan for use in the public 
comment process. Following the public 
comment process, the community bank 
would complete the second stage of the 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form, which 
includes fields for certifying compliance 
with public participation requirements. 
Evaluating Performance 
The OCC will rate a bank’s CRA 
performance ‘‘Satisfactory’’ if the bank 
substantially achieves its ‘‘Satisfactory’’ 
plan goals.
91
In general, a community 
bank would be considered to have 
substantially met its ‘‘Satisfactory’’ goals 
if the bank meets most of its measurable 
goals in most of its assessment areas, 
considering the importance of those 
goals to the strategic plan as a whole, 
and performance context factors explain 
the bank’s failure to meet particular 
goals. The OCC would rate a bank 
‘‘Outstanding’’ if it exceeds its plan 
goals for a ‘‘Satisfactory’’ rating and 
substantially achieves its plan goals for 
an ‘‘Outstanding’’ rating.
92
A bank that 
does not substantially meet its 
‘‘Satisfactory’’ goals in an assessment 
area, would be assigned a ‘‘Needs to 
Improve’’ or ‘‘Substantial 
Noncompliance’’ rating, as 
appropriate.
93
The OCC generally 
considers a ‘‘Needs to Improve’’ rating 
for a bank that substantially meets some 
measurable goals in most assessment 
areas. A community bank that under 
performs its measurable goals to a 
greater extent or fails to substantially 
meet its goals two evaluation periods in 
a row would generally receive a rating 
of ‘‘Substantial Noncompliance.’’ A 
community bank may designate in the 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form a 
weighting methodology that would 
address how the OCC would determine 
if the bank had substantially met its 
goals for a ‘‘Satisfactory’’ or 
‘‘Outstanding’’ rating. 
The Simplified Strategic Plan Form 
would also permit a community bank to 
elect evaluation under the otherwise 
applicable performance tests and 
standards if it fails to substantially meet 
its strategic plan’s measurable goals for 
a ‘‘Satisfactory’’ rating.
94
If a community 
bank does not make this election, the 
OCC will evaluate the bank’s CRA 
performance solely based on the 
measurable goals provided in the 
strategic plan. 
Preparation and Submission of a 
Strategic Plan 
Before a community bank submits a 
proposed strategic plan to the OCC for 
approval, bank management is 
encouraged to contact the bank’s 
supervisory office to request a 
consultation with OCC staff. The 
supervisory office schedules a 
consultation that generally includes 
staff from the supervisory office and 
other OCC offices. The purpose of the 
consultation would be to help the bank 
understand the requirements of the 
regulation, what information is 
responsive to those regulatory 
requirements, how to think about 
performance context in selecting and 
supporting elective goals or developing 
custom goals, and how the OCC applies 
the CRA regulation’s criteria for 
evaluating a strategic plan once 
submitted to the OCC for approval 
following the public comment process. 
During this consultation, the OCC 
would provide a community bank with 
preliminary feedback on the adequacy 
of its proposed strategic plan and the 
merits of the proposed measurable goals 
considering the bank’s performance 
context. This feedback would not 
constitute OCC approval of a strategic 
plan. The OCC would evaluate whether 
to approve a proposed strategic plan by 
considering the regulatory criteria for 
evaluating a strategic plan submitted to 
the agency for approval following the 
public comment process. 
Upon receipt of a complete Simplified 
Strategic Plan Form, the OCC will send 
an acknowledgment of receipt to the 
community bank. The OCC will deem a 
request for approval of a strategic plan 
complete if the bank has provided 
responsive information for all the fields 
on the Simplified Strategic Plan Form 
that provide information required by the 
regulation and attached any necessary 
supporting documentation.
95
If the 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form is 
deemed incomplete, the OCC will 
request the bank complete necessary 
fields on the Simplified Strategic Plan 
Form and resubmit the form to the OCC. 
In limited circumstances, the OCC may 
require the bank to submit additional 
information that the OCC deems 
necessary to make a determination on 
the strategic plan. A community bank 
should expeditiously communicate 
material changes to information initially 
furnished in the Simplified Strategic 
Plan Form to the OCC during the 
processing of a community bank’s 
request for approval. The OCC evaluates 
the information provided by the bank in 
the Simplified Strategic Plan Form to 
determine whether to approve the 
measurable goals in light of the public 
comments and relevant performance 
context (e.g., the bank’s capacity and constraints, business strategy, and 
product offerings). The OCC considers, 
as necessary, other information 
regarding the bank’s performance 
context in addition to the public 
comments and information submitted 
by the bank. 
Each request for approval of a 
strategic plan submitted to the OCC 
must contain a proposed effective 
date.
96
The proposed effective date must 
be at least three months after the request 
is submitted to the OCC. A community 
bank is not evaluated under a strategic

97
 
Community banks should direct 
questions regarding the simplified 
strategic plan process, completion of the 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form, or a 
pending submission by sending an 
email to the OCC or contacting their 
supervisory office. 
Case-by-Case Waiver of Regulatory 
Requirements 
The OCC has determined that, in 
certain instances, it may be appropriate 
to waive the strategic plan provision’s 
proposed effective date requirement or 
certain CRA data requirements
98
based 
on a community bank’s particular facts 
and circumstances. For the remaining 
regulatory requirements, the OCC has 
determined that waiver generally would 
not be appropriate. 
Under the simplified strategic plan 
process, on a case-by-case basis, the 
OCC would consider waiving the 
requirement that a community bank 
submit its proposed strategic plan to the 
OCC for approval at least three months 
prior to the proposed effective date if a 
strategic plan has been deemed 
complete and the OCC would have 
sufficient time to review and opine on 
the plan. Based on the OCC’s 
experience, it may be appropriate to 
waive the proposed effective date 
requirement if it would allow the bank 
to: (1) align the effective date of its 
strategic plan with the beginning of a 
performance year (i.e., a January 1st effective date); (2) avoid a gap between 
approved strategic plan terms; or (3) 
address other circumstances deemed 
relevant by the OCC. The OCC has also 
determined that it may be appropriate to 
waive certain of the CRA regulation’s 
data reporting requirements
99
on a case- 
by-case basis if those data are not 
necessary for evaluating the measurable 
goals included in a community bank’s 
proposed strategic plan. For example, 
the OCC may consider waiving the 
small business and small farm data 
collection and reporting requirements if 
a community bank has not included a 
retail lending goal in its strategic plan. 
The OCC notes, however, that it 
generally would be inappropriate for a 
community bank to develop a strategic 
plan that does not include measurable 
goals for lending products that are 
integral to the bank’s business strategy 
in order to seek waiver of the associated 
data requirements. 
The OCC believes that waiver may be 
appropriate, on a case-by-case basis, 
when: (1) a regulatory requirement is for 
the benefit of the OCC (e.g., the three month lead time for the proposed 
effective date provides time for the OCC 
to review a proposed strategic plan) and 
(2) waiving the requirement would have 
minimal impact on the OCC’s ability to 
evaluate the bank pursuant to the 
strategic plan if approved. For example, 
a waiver would have minimal impact on 
the OCC’s ability to evaluate a bank 
pursuant to a proposed strategic plan if 
the data that the bank was exempted 
from collecting and reporting would not 
be considered in evaluating the bank’s 
measurable goals or the bank’s 
performance under the otherwise 
applicable performance tests and 
standards for a bank that were to choose 
the substitute election. If the OCC were 
to decide to grant a waiver, the OCC 
would communicate that decision to the 
community bank in writing. The OCC 
believes it is appropriate to consider 
case-specific waivers to minimize the 
impact of regulatory requirements that 
impose unnecessary burden on 
community banks. 
C. Decision Process and Other 
Information 
Notification of Decision 
The strategic plan provision requires 
the OCC to act on plan within 60 days 
of receiving a complete plan or else the 
plan is deemed approved.
100
When 
possible, the OCC would aim to act 
within 45 days of receiving a complete 
strategic plan. The OCC may extend the 
review period for good cause and would 
notify the community bank in writing of 
any extension of the review period, the 
reason for the extension, and the date by 
which the agency expects to act on the 
request. Provided a bank submits a 
complete proposed strategic plan, the 
OCC expects that it generally will not 
extend the review period unless the 
bank’s capacity and constraints, product 
offerings, or business strategy materially 
change after submission of the plan. If 
the OCC fails to act within the review 
period or timely extend the review 
period, the OCC will deem the strategic 
plan to be approved. 
Confidentiality 
Under the provisions of the Freedom 
of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 
552), a request for approval of a strategic 
plan submitted to the OCC through the 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form is a 
public document and is available to the 
public upon request. The OCC’s 
decision approving or denying a 
strategic plan may also be available to 
the public under the FOIA. Under the 
CRA regulation, a community bank may 
submit information along with its 
strategic plan to the OCC on a 
confidential basis.
101
The Simplified 
Strategic Plan Form contains a 
confidential section that a bank 
requesting confidential treatment of 
certain information would use to submit 
that information. 
A request for confidential treatment of 
commercial information means the 
records arguably contain material 
exempt from release under Exemption 4 
of the FOIA. For example, if the 
requesting community bank believes 
that disclosure of commercial or 
financial information included with its 
request would likely result in 
substantial harm to its competitive 
position or that of its affiliates, 
confidential treatment of such 
information may be requested. This 
request for confidential treatment would 
be included in the confidential section 
of the Simplified Strategic Plan Form 
and must discuss in detail the 
justification for confidential treatment. 
The bank’s request for confidential 
treatment should explain the harm that 
would result from public release of the 
information. If a community bank 
requests confidential treatment of 
supplemental information provided 
outside of the confidential section of the 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form, the 
community bank should: (1) segregate 
the information from any other 
information that is submitted and (2) 
label the information as ‘‘Confidential.’’ 
The OCC determines whether 
information labeled ‘‘Confidential’’ 
warrants confidentiality and advises the 
requesting community bank of any 
decision to make information labeled 
‘‘Confidential’’ available to the public. A 
community bank should follow the 
guidance in this section when 
submitting confidential supervisory 
information, which includes any 
information contained in, related to, or 
derived from reports of examination, or 
confidential operating and condition 
reports. 
Plan Amendment 
During the term of an approved 
strategic plan, a bank may request 
approval of an amendment to the 
strategic plan if there is a material 
change in circumstances (e.g., a VerDate Sep<11>2014  21:20 Dec 19, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\22DEP1.SGM 22DEP1

a shift in the bank’s business strategy, or 
entrance into or exit from one or more 
assessment areas). Public participation 
is required in the development of an 
amendment to a previously approved 
strategic plan. To request approval by 
the OCC of a strategic plan amendment 
under the simplified strategic plan 
process, a community bank should 
submit the amendment portion of the 
Simplified Strategic Plan Form. 
Appendix A 
Proposed Elective Goals: Below is a list of 
the proposed elective goals developed based 
on the OCC’s supervisory experience, as 
discussed in this 
SUPPLEMENTARY 
INFORMATION. Each goal includes a 
performance measure and corresponding 
performance level. The proposed elective 
goals provide guidance on the general 
circumstances under which a community 
bank would use an elective goal. This 
guidance relies on the OCC’s experience with 
respect to the common performance context 
factors applicable to community banks of 
different sizes and types. Under the proposed 
simplified strategic plan process each 
community bank would determine the 
elective goals to include in its proposed 
strategic plan, if any, based on its specific 
performance context factors. A community 
bank’s performance context may support the 
use of goals in circumstances other than 
those suggested in the list below. 
Once finalized, the elective goals would be 
incorporated into the Simplified Strategic 
Plan Form. The elective goals included in the 
form would evolve over time as new goals are 
added. 
Goal Growth and Conversion Methodologies 
A community bank may opt to use one of 
the following methodologies for converting 
percentage-based elective goals to dollar- 
based elective goals and/or increasing the 
performance values in the goals during the 
plan term. The starting point for these 
conversions would be the percentage of T1 
capital or total assets as of December 31 of 
the year prior to the plan term. A community 
bank could also increase dollar or number 
based elective goals using these 
methodologies, as appropriate. The bank 
would allocate the percent of T1 capital or 
total assets, or the converted dollar value, 
based on these measures, to assessment areas 
based on the percentage of deposits assigned 
to the assessment areas covered by the plan. 
€T1 capital or total assets as of December 31 of the previous year in the plan term

Airworthiness Directives; Restricted 
Category Model CH–47D Helicopters 
AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 
SUMMARY: The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all 
restricted category Model CH–47D 
helicopters. This proposed AD was 
prompted by reports of fatigue cracking 
of the right-hand (RH) forward 
transmission support beam fitting. This 
proposed AD would require repetitively 
inspecting the RH forward transmission 
support beam fitting for cracking and, 
depending on the results, repairing any 
crack(s). This proposed AD would also 
require submitting data on any previous 
repairs and replaced fittings. The FAA 
is proposing this AD to address the 
unsafe condition on these products. 
DATES: The FAA must receive comments on this proposed AD by February 5, 
2026. 
ADDRESSES: You may send comments, using the procedures found in 14 CFR 
11.43 and 11.45, by any of the following

will also post a report summarizing each 
substantive verbal contact received 
about this NPRM. 
Confidential Business Information 
CBI is commercial or financial 
information that is both customarily and 
actually treated as private by its owner. 
Under the Freedom of Information Act 
(FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), CBI is exempt 
from public disclosure. If your 
comments responsive to this NPRM 
contain commercial or financial 
information that is customarily treated 
as private, that you actually treat as 
private, and that is relevant or 
responsive to this NPRM, it is important 
that you clearly designate the submitted 
comments as CBI. Please mark each 
page of your submission containing CBI 
as ‘‘PROPIN.’’ The FAA will treat such 
marked submissions as confidential 
under the FOIA, and they will not be 
placed in the public docket of this 
NPRM. Submissions containing CBI 
should be sent to Sarah Illg, Aviation 
Safety Engineer, FAA, 3960 Paramount 
Boulevard, Lakewood, CA 90712. Any 
commentary that the FAA receives 
which is not specifically designated as 
CBI will be placed in the public docket 
for this rulemaking. 
Background 
The FAA received reports of fatigue 
cracking of the RH forward transmission 
support beam fitting having part number 
145S1838–1 on CH–47D helicopters. 
CH–47D type certificate holders and 
operators have reported experiencing at 
least one cracking event around the 
fastener on the RH forward transmission 
support beam fitting at the right butt 
line (RBL) 18 from station (STA) 76 to 
STA 120. This condition, if not 
addressed, could result in crack 
propagation and lead to failure of the 
RH forward transmission support beam 
fitting, excessive vibration, and 
consequent loss of control of the 
helicopter. 
FAA’s Determination 
The FAA is issuing this NPRM after 
determining that the unsafe condition 
described previously is likely to exist or 
develop on other products of the same 
type design. 
Proposed AD Requirements in This 
NPRM 
This proposed AD would require 
repetitively inspecting the RH forward 
transmission support beam fitting for 
cracking and, depending on the results, 
repairing any crack(s) or replacing parts. 
This proposed AD would also require 
submitting data on any previous repairs 
and replaced fittings to the FAA. 
Costs of Compliance 
The FAA estimates that this AD, if 
adopted as proposed, would affect 42 
helicopters of U.S. registry. 
The FAA estimates the following 
costs to comply with this proposed AD: 
ESTIMATEDCOSTS 
Action Labor cost Parts 
cost 
Cost per 
product 
Cost on U.S. 
operators 
Inspect RH forward transmission support beam fitting ...... 2 work-hours × $85 per hour = $170 ......... $0  $170  $7,140 Report previous repairs and replaced fittings .................... 1 work-hour × $85 per hour = $85 ............. 0  85  3,570 The FAA has received no definitive 
data on which to base the cost estimates 
for the on-condition repairs specified in 
this proposed AD. 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
A federal agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, nor shall a person be subject 
to a penalty for failure to comply with 
a collection of information subject to the 
requirements of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act unless that collection of 
information displays a currently valid 
OMB Control Number. The OMB 
Control Number for this information 
collection is 2120–0056. Public 
reporting for this collection of 
information is estimated to be 
approximately 1 hour per response, 
including the time for reviewing 
instructions, searching existing data 
sources, gathering and maintaining the 
data needed, and completing and 
reviewing the collection of information. 
All responses to this collection of 
information are mandatory. Send 
comments regarding this burden 
estimate or any other aspect of this 
collection of information, including 
suggestions for reducing this burden, to:

Authority for This Rulemaking 
Title 49 of the United States Code 
specifies the FAA’s authority to issue 
rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, 
section 106, describes the authority of 
the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: 
Aviation Programs, describes in more 
detail the scope of the Agency’s 
authority. 
The FAA is issuing this rulemaking 
under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 
44701: General requirements. Under 
that section, Congress charges the FAA 
with promoting safe flight of civil 
aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
regulations for practices, methods, and 
procedures the Administrator finds 
necessary for safety in air commerce. 
This regulation is within the scope of 
that authority because it addresses an 
unsafe condition that is likely to exist or 
develop on products identified in this 
rulemaking action.

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with PROPOSALS59766 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Proposed Rules Regulatory Findings 
The FAA determined that this 
proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 
13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the 
States, on the relationship between the 
national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
For the reasons discussed above, I 
certify this proposed regulation: 
(1) Is not a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ under Executive Order 12866, 
(2) Would not affect intrastate 
aviation in Alaska, and 
(3) Would not have a significant 
economic impact, positive or negative, 
on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. 
List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 
Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation 
safety, Incorporation by reference, 
Safety. 
The Proposed Amendment 
Accordingly, under the authority 
delegated to me by the Administrator, 
the FAA proposes to amend 14 CFR part 
39 as follows: 
PART 39—AIRWORTHINESS 
DIRECTIVES 
1. The authority citation for part 39 
continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701. § 39.13 [Amended] 
2. The FAA amends § 39.13 by adding 
the following new airworthiness 
directive: 
Restricted Category Model CH–47D 
Helicopters: Docket No. FAA–2025– 5394; Project Identifier AD–2025–01194– 
R. 
(a) Comments Due Date 
The FAA must receive comments on this 
airworthiness directive (AD) by February 5, 
2026. 
(b) Affected ADs 
None. 
(c) Applicability 
This AD applies to restricted category 
Model CH–47D helicopters; current type

(e) Unsafe Condition 
This AD was prompted by reports of 
fatigue cracking of the right-hand (RH) 
forward transmission support beam fitting. 
The FAA is issuing this AD to detect and 
address fatigue cracking of the RH forward 
transmission support beam fittings. The 
unsafe condition, if not addressed, could 
result in crack propagation and lead to failure 
of the RH forward transmission support beam 
fitting, excessive vibration, and consequent 
loss of control of the helicopter. 
(f) Compliance 
Comply with this AD within the 
compliance times specified, unless already 
done. 
(g) Required Actions 
(1) Within 30 hours time in service (TIS) 
after the effective date of this AD and 
thereafter at intervals not to exceed 100 hours

magnification and light source, visually 
inspect the RH forward transmission support 
beam fitting having part number 145S1838– 
1 at right butt line (RBL) 18 from station 
(STA) 76 to STA 120 for cracks. Fastener 
holes in the area circled in figure 1 to 
paragraph (g)(1) of this AD are most 
susceptible to cracking. If any crack is 
detected, before further flight, repair or 
replace parts using a method approved by the 
Manager, West Certification Branch, FAA, in

hazardous-air. 
B. What is the HAP list? 
In this section, the EPA provides a 
brief overview of the list of HAP subject 
to regulation under CAA section 112 
(‘‘the HAP list’’), the Agency’s process 
for considering petitions to modify the 
HAP list by adding or deleting a 
substance, and information about 2- 
BEB, CAS No. 5451–76–3. 
The HAP list is a list of organic and 
inorganic substances that have been 
identified as HAP to be regulated under 
CAA section 112. The initial HAP list, 
which can be found in CAA section 
112(b)(1), was established by Congress 
in the 1990 amendments to the CAA. 
The substances listed as HAP have been 
associated with a wide variety of 
adverse health effects, including cancer, 
neurological effects, reproductive 
effects, and developmental effects. The 
health effects associated with various 
HAP differ depending on the toxicity of 
the specific HAP and the circumstances 
of exposure, such as the amount of the 
substance present, the length of time a 
person is exposed, and the stage of life 
at which the person is exposed. CAA 
section 112(c) directs the EPA to first 
identify and list source categories that 
emit HAP, then set emission standards 
for those listed source categories under 
CAA section 112(d). Standards 
promulgated under CAA section 112(d) 
are commonly referred to as National 
Emission Standards for Hazardous Air 
Pollutants (NESHAP). 
C. What is the authority to modify the 
HAP list? 
CAA section 112(b)(3)(A) specifies 
that any person may petition the 
Administrator to modify the HAP list by 
adding or deleting a substance.
1
The 
Administrator must grant or deny a 
petition to delete a HAP within 18 
months. CAA section 112(b)(3)(C) and 
(D) sets out the substantive criteria for 
granting a petition to delete a HAP from 
the HAP list.
2
Petitions should include 
sufficient information to support the 
requested deletion of a HAP. 
To grant a petition to delete a 
substance from the HAP list, CAA 
section 112(b)(3)(C) provides that the 
Administrator must determine that 
‘‘there is adequate data on the health 
and environmental effects of the 
substance to determine that emissions, 
ambient concentrations, 
bioaccumulation, or deposition of the 
substance may not reasonably be 
anticipated to cause any adverse effects 
to the human health or adverse 
environmental effects.’’
3
CAA section 
112(a)(7) defines an ‘‘adverse 
environmental effect’’ as ‘‘[a]ny 
significant and widespread adverse 
effect, which may reasonably be 
anticipated, to wildlife, aquatic life, or 
other natural resources, including 
adverse impacts on populations of 
endangered or threatened species or 
significant degradation of 
environmental quality over broad 
areas.’’
4
 
The EPA has long explained that CAA 
section 112(b)(3)(C) does not require 
absolute certainty that a pollutant will 
not cause adverse effects on human 
health or the environment before it may 
be deleted from the list.
5
The use of the 
terms ‘‘adequate’’ and ‘‘reasonably’’ in 
CAA section 112(b)(3)(C) indicate that 
the EPA must weigh the potential 
uncertainties and likely significance of 
any projections, assessments, and 
estimations. Uncertainties concerning 
the risks of adverse health or 
environmental effects may be mitigated 
if it is shown that projected exposures 
are sufficiently low in relation to levels 
where adverse effects may occur, thus 
providing reasonable assurance that 
such adverse effects will not occur. 
Similarly, uncertainties concerning the 
magnitude of projected exposures may 
be mitigated if it is demonstrated that 
the levels that might cause adverse 
health or environmental effects are 
sufficiently high to provide reasonable 
assurance that exposures will not reach 
harmful levels. 
The EPA further posited that 
questions as to whether HAP emissions 
present adverse health and 
environmental effects, and questions 
regarding the kinds of effects that can 
come from exposure to those emissions, 
may, in certain instances, border on the 
frontiers of scientific knowledge and 
involve limited or inconsistent data. For 
example, there could be limited 
scientific knowledge of the effects of 
pollutant exposure on human health or 
the environment. There could also be 
limited emissions data from the relevant 
source category. Further, some 
pollutants have no known safe level of 
exposure. CAA section 112(b)(3)(C) does 
not require the Administrator to base his 
determination to grant a delisting 
petition solely on a single parameter or 
measure; therefore, the EPA’s historical 
view has been that the Administrator 
has the discretion to weigh various 
factors or data differently.
6
The 
Administrator’s decision to delist (or to 
deny a petition to delist) a HAP is made 
on a case-by-case basis and involves a 
thorough and comprehensive review of 
factual issues, scientific evidence, and 
data provided in support of a delisting 
petition. The EPA has also long 
explained that CAA section 112(b)(3)(C) 
allows the Administrator to balance the 
likelihood of adverse health effects 
against the limits of available scientific 
data and to exercise informed 
judgement in making decisions 
considering uncertainties in scientific 
data. Any projections, assessments, and 
estimations by a petitioner must thus be 
reasonable and not based on conjecture. 
In sum, the CAA does not call for 
certitude of harm but rather accords the 
Administrator discretion and flexibility 
in taking action that is protective of 
public health and the environment, 
including by considering and balancing 
factors and relevant policy concerns. 
If the Administrator decides to deny 
a petition, the EPA publishes a written 
explanation of the basis for denial in the 
Federal Register. A decision to deny a 
petition is a final Agency action subject 
to judicial review in the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit under CAA section 307(b). If the 
Administrator decides to grant a 
petition, the EPA publishes a written 
explanation of the decision in a 
proposed rule to delete the substance 
from the HAP list codified in 40 CFR 
part 63, subpart C as we are doing here.

petition to delist ethylene glycol monobutyl ether 
as a HAP); 64 FR 38668, July 19, 1999 (notice of 
receipt of a complete petition to delist methanol as 
a HAP); 64 FR 33453, June 23, 1999 (notice of 
receipt of a complete petition to delist Methyl Ethyl 
Ketone as a HAP). 
D. What is the process for delisting a 
HAP? 
In this section, the EPA describes the 
Agency’s historical process for 
considering petitions to delist a HAP 
from the HAP list and what process the 
EPA is following for the petition to 
delist 2-BEB. 
A petition to delist a HAP is a formal 
request to the EPA from an individual 
or group to remove a substance from the 
HAP list. Removal from the HAP list 
means the substance is no longer subject 
to the regulatory provisions of CAA 
section 112 and related statutory 
provisions governing HAP. CAA section 
112(b)(3)(A) requires the Administrator 
to either grant or deny a petition by 
publishing a written explanation of the 
reasons for the Administrator’s decision. 
CAA section 112(b)(3)(A) does not 
specifically require a formal rulemaking 
process to either grant or deny a petition 
to delist a HAP from the HAP list. 
Although the delisting action for a listed 
HAP is not subject to the rulemaking 
procedures of CAA section 307(d), for 
all previous delisting actions the EPA 
has published and solicited public 
comment on relevant aspects of the 
Agency’s consideration of such a 
complete petition in the Federal 
Register.
7
Once the EPA grants a 
petition to delist a HAP, such deletion 
is codified into 40 CFR part 63, subpart 
C. 
The EPA’s petition review process 
proceeds in two phases: a completeness 
determination and a technical review. 
During the completeness determination, 
the EPA conducts a broad review of the 
petition to determine whether all the 
necessary subject areas are addressed 
and whether reasonable information and 
analyses are presented for each of these 
subject areas. During the technical 
review, the EPA conducts a thorough 
scientific review of the complete 
petition to determine whether the data, 
analyses, interpretations, and 
conclusions in the petition are 
appropriate and technically sound. 
During the technical review, the EPA 
also determines whether the petition 
satisfies the necessary requirements of 
CAA section 112(b)(3)(B) or (C) and 
adequately supports a decision to either 
list or delist the HAP. 
Under prior EPA practice, once a 
petition was determined to be complete, 
the Agency placed a notice of receipt of 
a complete petition in the Federal 
Register. The Federal Register notice 
announced a public comment period on 
the complete petition and started the 
technical review phase of our decision- 
making process.
8
Then, during the 
technical review of the petition, the EPA 
considered all comments and data 
submitted during the public comment 
period for the notice of receipt of a 
complete petition. Subsequently, the 
EPA would publish a document in the 
Federal Register containing a written 
explanation of the basis for the decision 
to either grant or deny the petition. If 
the EPA intended to grant the delisting 
petition, the Agency would also propose 
the addition of regulatory text to 40 CFR 
part 63, subpart C to codify the deletion. 
After consideration of public comments, 
the EPA would publish the final 
decision on the petition in the Federal 
Register. If the EPA granted a delisting 
petition, in a final action the Agency 
would amend 40 CFR part 63, subpart 
C, List of Hazardous Air Pollutants, 
Petitions Process, Lesser Quantity 
Designations, Source Category List, to 
codify the deletion of the substance 
from the HAP list. Thus, the EPA’s prior 
practice encompassed at least three 
publications in the Federal Register. 
In this action, the EPA is announcing 
a streamlined approach to petitions 
under section CAA 112(b)(3)(B) effective 
with this petition to delist 2-BEB. Rather 
than issuing a Federal Register 
document announcing the receipt of a 
complete petition, the EPA will now 
inform the petitioner by letter once a 
preliminary evaluation determines that 
the petition is complete according to 
Agency criteria.
9
Subsequently, once the 
EPA’s technical review is complete, the 
Agency will publish a Federal Register 
document with a written explanation of 
the basis for the proposed decision to 
grant or deny the petition and, if 
appropriate, propose the addition of 
regulatory text to 40 CFR part 63, 
subpart C to codify the deletion. After 
the opportunity for comment and 
review of the comments, the EPA will 
publish in the Federal Register the final 
action either granting or denying the 
petition. If the petition to delist is 
granted, 40 CFR part 63, subpart C will 
be modified to incorporate the change. 
Additionally, the EPA intends to 
reorganize 40 CFR part 63, subpart C to 
provide clarity and allow space for 
future amendments. See section IV. of 
this preamble for more information on 
this reorganization. 
E. What is the history of the 2-BEB 
delisting process? 
In this section, the EPA provides an 
overview and information about the 
Agency’s technical review of the 
petition to delist 2-BEB. 
On September 30, 2019, the Dow 
Chemical Company (the ‘‘Petitioner’’) 
submitted a petition to delete 2-BEB 
(CAS No. 5451–76–3) from the glycol 
ethers category of the HAP list (the 
‘‘Petition’’). 2-BEB is a colorless liquid 
with low odor, a high boiling point (292 
°C at 760 millimeters of mercury 
(mmHg)), and low vapor pressure 
(2.09E–04 mmHg at 20 °C). It is miscible 
in water with moderate water solubility 
(106 mg/L at 20 °C). 2-BEB has utility 
as a coalescing solvent for water-based, 
low volatility organic compound (VOC) 
coatings. It can also be used as a 
replacement for phthalate-based 
plasticizers in caulking compounds and 
in some polyvinyl chloride (PVC) 
formulations. 
Following receipt of the Petition, the 
EPA conducted a preliminary 
evaluation to determine whether the 
Petition was complete according to 
Agency criteria. To be deemed 
complete, the EPA requires that a 
petition consider available data on 
health and environmental effects of the 
substance to be deleted. A petition 
should also provide comprehensive 
emissions data, including peak and 
annual average emissions for each 
known source or for an appropriately 
selected subset of sources, and must 
estimate the resulting exposures to 
people living in the vicinity of the 
sources. In addition, a petition must 
discuss the environmental impacts 
associated with emissions of the 
substance to the ambient air and 
impacts associated with the subsequent 
cross-media transport of those 
emissions.
10
The EPA determined the 
Petition to be incomplete and requested 
additional information from the 
Petitioner. After receiving additional

Petition. Based on the preliminary 
assessment, the EPA had follow-up 
conversations with the Petitioner in 
June 2022 to further clarify certain 
aspects of the Petition. After these 
discussions, the Petitioner submitted 
additional information in September 
2022.

14
The 
EPA has fully considered all of the 
Petitioners’ submissions in the technical 
review and the determination to 
propose granting the Petition to delist 2- 
BEB from the glycol ethers category in 
the HAP list. 
II. Summary of the Petition 
In this section, the EPA presents the 
details of the Petition that includes the 
exposure assessment, the human health 
effects assessment, the Petitioners’ risk 
assessment and methodology and 
ecological assessment and conclusions. 
A. Overview 
The Petition is presented in the form 
of a risk assessment that considers 
multiple routes of exposure and 
evaluates the likelihood and severity of 
adverse effects to human health and the 
environment arising from exposures to 
ambient levels of 2-BEB. Existing 
literature on the toxicity and health 
effects of 2-BEB is sparse. To address 
this gap, the Petitioner performed oral, 
dermal, and inhalation toxicity testing 
according to the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) guidelines.
15
The 
Petitioner also relied on the EPA’s 2010 
Integrated Risk Information System 
(IRIS) assessment for ethylene glycol 
monobutyl ether (EGBE) as the basis for 
the human health effects evaluation of 
2-BEB.
16
The Petitioner further 
provided a worst-case inhalation 
toxicity analysis that used ethylene 
glycol monomethyl ether (EGME), 
which is the most potent chemical with 
a reference concentration (RfC) available 
from the EPA’s IRIS assessment program 
for the glycol ethers category.
17
In sum, 
the Petition characterizes the sources 
and releases of 2-BEB, estimates 
exposures, identifies the potential 
hazard and the dose-response 
relationship of 2-BEB, characterizes 
environmental risk, and characterizes 
the human health risk from a reasonable 
worst-case lifetime exposure to 2-BEB 
and a reasonable worst-case short-term 
(24-hour) exposure to 2-BEB. 
B. Inhalation Exposure Assessment 
1. Air Emissions Estimate 
The Petitioner estimated 2-BEB 
emissions based on nationwide 
projected production volume and 
modeled emissions estimates. In the 
Petition, the Petitioner states that, as of 
September 30, 2019, all 2-BEB produced 
domestically has been for export and 
use outside of the United States. The 
Petitioner estimated that about 200,000 
pounds (lbs) (91,000 kilograms (kg)) of 
2-BEB were produced in the United 
States from 2016 to mid-2019, an 
average of about 57,000 lbs/yr (26,000 
kg/yr). The Petitioner further stated that 
2-BEB is being explored as a substitute 
for current components of water-based 
coatings but is not currently used or 
sold in the United States. Additionally, 
there are no emissions or monitoring 
data available that are pertinent to the 
domestic manufacture, use, and release 
of 2-BEB in the United States. 
To address the absence of available 
domestic emissions or monitoring data 
for 2-BEB, the Petitioner estimated 2- 
BEB emissions based on their projected 
production volume. To estimate the 
projected maximum production volume 
of 2-BEB, the Petitioner assumed that 
the production time would be 48–50 
hours per batch and that 2-BEB would 
be manufactured in 10 batches. Thus, 
the approximate production time for the 
entire quantity of 2-BEB would range 
from 480–500 hours. For processing, it 
was assumed that 2-BEB would be 
incorporated into a water-based paint 
product and that 265,000 kg/yr would 
be available for processing (275,000 kg/ 
yr minus 10,000 kg/yr lost to emissions 
in manufacturing). The Petitioner 
estimated that the projected maximum 
production volume of 2-BEB would be 
about 275,000 kg/yr. 
The Petitioner then used the Chemical 
Screening Tool for Exposure and 
Environmental Releases (ChemSTEER) 
to generate screening-level emissions 
estimates for potential releases of 2-BEB 
into the air and water from 
manufacturing and processing. 
ChemSTEER is a computer-based 
software program developed by the 
EPA’s Office of Pollution Prevention 
and Toxics (OPPT). ChemSTEER 
combines multiple mathematical 
models (e.g., EPA/OPPT penetration model) and emissions estimation 
methods (e.g., AP–42) into one tool that can be used to generate ‘‘screening-level 
estimates for environmental releases of 
and worker exposures to a chemical 
manufactured and used in industrial 
and commercial operations (i.e., 
workplaces).’’
18
ChemSTEER results are 
considered screening level because 
many of the models in ChemSTEER are 
characterized by the EPA to be 
screening-level models. As such, the 
screening-level results from 
ChemSTEER ‘‘are intended to be 
conservative in that predicted results 
are likely to be higher, or at least higher 
than average, as compared to actual 
releases and exposures occurring in the 
real-world setting.’’
19
 
To generate screening-level emissions 
estimates for potential releases of 2-BEB 
into the air from manufacturing and 
processing, the Petitioner used the 
following emission points. For 
manufacturing, emissions points for 2- 
BEB included: 
€Aqueous wash of organic mass. €Distillation column bottoms disposal. 
€Sampling of liquid product. €Loading of liquid product into drums. 
€Equipment cleaning losses of liquids from multiple vessels. 
For processing, emissions points for 
2-BEB included:

The Petitioner then used the 
Equilibrium Criterion model to estimate 
emissions of 2-BEB from wastewater 
into the air.

Table 1 summarizes the 
Petitioner’s estimated air emissions of 2- 
BEB from manufacturing, processing, 
and wastewater.

Modeling of 2-BEB Air 
Concentrations and Calculation of 
Noncancer Hazard Quotient 
The Petitioner used the EPA’s 
Exposure and Fate Assessment 
Screening Tool (EFAST) to estimate 
ambient air concentrations of 2-BEB 
emitted from manufacturing, processing, 
and wastewater.
21
The EFAST tool uses 
SCREEN3, a single-source Gaussian 
plume model that provides maximum 
ground-level concentrations for point, 
area, flare, and volume sources. The 
SCREEN3 model is the screening 
version of the Industrial Source 
Complex 3 (ISC3) model.
22
The 
SCREEN3 model is listed by the EPA as 
an appropriate screening model. As a 
screening tool, EFAST/SCREEN3 
‘‘modeled estimates of concentrations 
and doses are designed to reasonably 
overestimate exposures, for use in an 
exposure assessment in the absence of 
or with reliable monitoring data.’’
23
 
The Petitioner conducted air 
concentration modeling using the air 
emissions of 2-BEB that are presented in 
table 1 and assumed that the mass of 2- 
BEB is released as fugitive emissions 
(using the following fugitive release 
parameters for manufacturing/ 
processing—a 3 meter (m) release height 
from the ground and a release area that 
is 10 m in length and 10 m in width; 
using the following fugitive release 
parameters for wastewater—a 3 m 
release height from the ground and a 
release area that is 10,000 m in length 
and 10,000 m in width) with no 
emission control technologies in 
operation. Table 2 presents the 
maximum 24-hour and annual average 
2-BEB inhalation exposure 
concentrations in milligram per cubic 
meter (mg/m

) that resulted from the 
Petitioner’s analysis.

Human Health Effects Assessment 
The Petitioner claimed that 2-BEB is 
rapidly metabolized in vivo to form 
EGBE (CAS No. 111–76–2) and benzoic 
acid (CAS No. 65–85–0) in both animals 
and humans. The EPA has previously 
modified the HAP list by removing 
EGBE from the glycol ethers category.
24
 
To address the sparse literature on the 
toxicity and health effects of 2-BEB, the 
Petitioner performed oral, dermal, and 
inhalation toxicity testing according to 
OECD guidelines. The Petitioner used 
subchronic oral toxicity data for 2-BEB 
consistent with OECD Guideline 408 
(1998)
25
and the 2010 IRIS assessment 
for EGBE
26
as the basis for their human 
health effects evaluation of 2-BEB. The 
Petitioner also provided a worst-case 
inhalation toxicity analysis using 
EGME, which is the most potent 
chemical with a RfC available for the 
glycol ethers category.
27
 
To evaluate the potential for acute 
inhalation toxicity, the Petitioner 
provided inhalation studies that were 
performed using aerosolized 2-BEB. 
Male and female F344/DuCrl rats were 
exposed via a nose-only exposure 
system for four hours to chamber 
concentrations of 3.71 or 5.39 mg 2-BEB 
per liter (L) (these exposure 
concentrations were significantly higher 
than the estimated ambient 
concentrations in table 2). The rats were 
observed for 14 days post-exposure. 
Clinical observations of soiling on 
various parts of the body were made; 
however, this effect was resolved by day 
seven. All treated groups had mean 
body weight losses on day two, with 
recovery to pre-exposure levels by day 
eight. There were no gross pathological 
abnormalities detected at necropsy.

To compensate for the lack of 2-BEB 
vapor inhalation data, the Petitioner 
relied on the chronic inhalation data for 
EGBE to estimate the chronic risk of 2- 
BEB exposure to human health. EGBE is 
one of the two rapidly generated 
metabolites for 2-BEB, which the EPA 
has previously delisted from the glycol 
ethers category,
28
The Petitioner also 
provided a route-to-route extrapolation 
based on 2-BEB oral toxicity data for 
comparison. To address the uncertainty 
associated with estimates that are either 
not chemical or route specific, the 
Petitioner also performed a worst-case 
toxicity analysis for EGME, the most 
potent chemical for the glycol ethers 
category with a RfC. 
The Petitioner conducted acute and 
subchronic oral toxicity studies 
according to OECD guidelines. These 
studies served to help characterize the 
hazards from oral exposure to 2-BEB 
and to estimate a screening oral 
reference dose (RfD) value for 2-BEB 
exposure. Additionally, the Petitioner 
conducted an acute dermal exposure 
study. The study details and results can 
be found in Attachment A–1 and 
Attachments 1–12 of the Petition and 
are available in the docket for this 
action. 
In the acute oral study, the Petitioner 
estimated the median lethal dose (LD50) 
value to be 940 mg/kg in female Wistar 
rats. In mice dosed with 2000 mg/kg, 
adverse effects or abnormal findings 
were observed in the kidney, urinary 
bladder, stomach glandular mucosa, and 
liver. Mice dosed at 550 mg/kg showed 
no abnormal clinical signs. In the 
dermal study, female and male Wistar 
rats were exposed at 2000 mg/kg with 
no clinical signs of toxicity, skin 
reactions, or mortality under the 14-day 
observation period. 
The Petitioner submitted a 28-day 
study on the reproductive toxicity of 2- 
BEB via oral exposure. The study, 
published by Johnson et al., 2016 was 
conducted in groups of 12 male and 12 
female Crl:CD(SD) rats fed either 0, 500, 
1,500, or 5,000 parts per million (ppm) 
of 2-BEB.
29
For both female and male 
rats, dosing began two weeks before 
breeding. For females, dosing continued 
until postpartum day four and for male 
rats until test day 36. Over the course 
of the study, dams (pregnant rats) were 
monitored for clinical observations, 
body weight gain, and feed 
consumption. At necropsy, dams were 
evaluated for gross pathologic lesions, 
organ weights (liver, kidney, spleen, 
uterine), hematological effects, number 
of corpora lutea, uterine implantations, 
resorptions, and live/dead fetuses. The 
fetuses were weighed, sexed, and 
evaluated for external alterations or 
skeletal abnormalities. No treatment- 
related effects on reproductive function 
or pre-natal/early neonatal growth and 
survival in the offspring were observed 
at any dose level. At 5,000 ppm, 
decreased feed consumption and body 
weight, increased spleen weight, and 
regenerative anemia were observed in 
female rats. Females given 5,000 ppm 
also had a treatment-related higher 
platelet count, which may occur in 
association with reticulocytosis. Higher 
mean urea nitrogen, triglyceride, 
creatinine, and phosphorus 
concentrations were found in female 
rats in the 5,000-ppm treatment group. 
No adverse effects were observed in the 
females given 500 or 1,500 ppm or in 
males at any dose level. 
The Petitioner also submitted a 
subchronic oral toxicity study.
30
The 
study was performed in compliance 
with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 
and OECD guidelines. The dose 
selections were informed by a 
previously conducted range-finding 
study published by Johnson et al., 
2015.
31
Ten male and ten female rats per 
treatment group consumed food 
containing 0, 500, 1,500, or 5,000 ppm 
of 2-BEB for at least 90 days. These diets 
resulted in time-weighted average doses 
of 0, 28.9, 88.1, or 285 mg/kg/day for 
males and 0, 32.6, 94.9, or 310 mg/kg/ 
day for females, respectively. The 
Petitioner reported daily cage-side 
observations, weekly detailed clinical 
observations, ophthalmic examinations, 
body weights/body weight gains, feed 
consumption, hematology, prothrombin 
time, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, 
selected organ weights, and gross and 
histopathologic examinations. No 2- 
BEB-related effects on clinical signs, 
ophthalmic, hematology, prothrombin 
time, urinalysis parameters, organ 
weight, or gross or histopathologic 
observations were observed. At the 
highest dose (5,000 ppm), female rats 
showed a decrease in body weight gain 
and feed consumption. At the same 
dose, male rats demonstrated a 
statistically significant reduction in 
serum sodium levels. No effects were 
observed at the doses below 5,000 ppm. 
The Petitioner selected a no-observed- 
adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 1,500 
ppm based on decreases in body weight 
gain and feed consumption in females. 
The NOAEL was identified as 1,500 
ppm because this was the highest dose 
administered to rats that did not result 
in any measurable adverse effects. In the 
90-day oral toxicity study, the 5,000- 
ppm dose reduced body weight and 
food consumption in female rats. The 
Petitioner estimated the NOAEL to be 
equivalent to roughly 100 mg/kg/day in 
rats. The Petitioner chose not to convert 
the rat dose to a human equivalent dose 
(HED), citing species differences in the 
rate of formation of, and sensitivity to, 
the butoxyacetic acid (BAA) metabolite 
of EGBE, which is linked to hemolytic 
toxicity. The Petitioner applied a 
cumulative uncertainty factor (UF) of 90 
to account for extrapolation from the 
subchronic to a chronic exposure 
duration (UF
S
= 1), extrapolation from a 
lowest-observed-adverse-effect level 
(LOAEL) to a NOAEL (UF
L
= 1), 
variation in sensitivity within the 
human population (UF
H
= 10), variation 
in sensitivity from animals to humans 
(UF
A
= 3), and gaps in the database (UF
D
 
= 3). The Petitioner’s selection of 
uncertainty factors assumed that 2-BEB 
toxicity is driven solely by the EGBE/ 
BAA metabolites, resulting in an 
estimated RfD of 1.1 mg/kg/day based 
on 2-BEB oral toxicity data. 
The Petitioner selected the UF
H
of 10 
to match the UF
H
used in the EGBE RfD 
determination and account for the 
potential for some individuals to have 
altered metabolism, excretion, or 
susceptibility to hemolytic toxicity of 
the BAA metabolite. The Petitioner 
selected the UF
A
of 3 for toxicokinetics 
due to the absence of a physiologically 
based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model 
for 2-BEB to account for species 
differences between the rats and 
humans. A value of 1 was selected by 
the Petitioner for the toxicodynamic 
portion citing several studies that have 
been performed indicating that humans 
are significantly less susceptible than 
rats to the hemolytic effects of 
BAA.

selected the UF
D
of 3 because 2-BEB 
lacks a chronic study and subchronic 
studies in a second species. The 
Petitioner did not select the UF
D
of 10 
because of the available data on the 2- 
BEB metabolites, EGBE and benzoic 
acid. The Petitioner determined that the 
UF
S
of 1 is sufficient because the effect 
used as the basis of their RfD, 
hemolysis, does not increase with 
longer exposure. The Petitioner also 
determined that the UF
L
of 1 is 
sufficient because the RfD was derived 
using a NOAEL. 
The Petitioner provided the following 
reports on the methods and results of 
three key in vitro GLP-studies to assess 
2-BEB’s potential for genotoxicity: a 
Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay 
(OECD Guideline 471), an In Vitro 
Mammalian Cell Gene Mutation Test 
(OECD Guideline 476), and an In Vitro 
Mammalian Chromosome Aberration 
Test (OECD Guideline 473). In addition, 
the Petitioner provided the results of a 
Mammalian Erythrocyte Micronucleus 
Test (OECD Guideline 474).
36
For 
genotoxicity, 2-BEB tested negative both 
with and without metabolic activation 
for all three in vitro genotoxicity assays 
and likewise tested negative in the in 
vivo micronucleus test assay. 
D. Risk Characterization and 
Conclusions Regarding Risks to Human 
Health 
There is currently no RfC for 2-BEB. 
Therefore, to calculate a conservative 
noncancer hazard quotient (HQ) for 
inhalation exposure to 2-BEB, the 
Petitioner used the most conservative 
RfC value associated with a member of 
the glycol ethers category as a surrogate, 
namely, EGME.
37
According to the IRIS, 
the RfC for EGME is 0.02 mg/m
3
. The 
Petitioner divided the concentrations in 
table 2 of this preamble by the RfC for 
EGME to calculate a conservative 
noncancer HQ for 2-BEB. Table 3 
presents the resulting HQs by emissions 
source.

the conservative assumptions and large 
production volumes, all HQs are 
substantially below 1, indicating low to 
minimal risk for human inhalation 
exposures. For ingestion and dermal 
exposures, the Petitioner summarized 
various HQs estimated in table 17 of the 
Petition, which is available in the 
docket for this action. 
E. Ecological Assessment and 
Conclusions 
The Petitioner conducted an aquatic 
and terrestrial ecological risk 
assessment to evalute the potential for 
adverse environmental effects from 2- 
BEB. The Petitioner estimated a water- 
concentration benchmark that should be 
protective of aquatic life as a predicted 
no-effect concentration (PNEC) value 
considering invertebrates, fish, and 
algae. For terrestrial PNECs, the 
Petitioner evaluated earthworms and 
plants. Sediments were excluded from 
the Petitioner’s analysis because the 
fugacity modeling predicted minor 
partitioning to sediments. 
The Petitioner conducted ecotoxicity 
tests for aquatic biota using the the 
appropriate OPPT guideline.
38
The 
Petitioner also conducted acute and 
chronic fish and invertebrat, toxicity 
tests along with algal tests for 2-BEB in 
surface water using appropriate EPA/ 
OECD guidelines. The Petitioner further 
conducted earthworm and seedling 
emergence tests on 2-BEB in soils using 
appropriate guidelines. Based on those 
tests, which also fulfill the EPA OPPT 
minimum data set requirement, the 
Petitioner calculated an aquatic PNEC of 
0.00659 mg/L water and a soil PNEC of 
2.5 mg/kg dry weight (dw) soil. To 
estimate environmental risks, the 
Petitioner used the HQ approach, as 
described in section II.D. of this 
preamble. In this case, the HQ compares 
the estimated exposure level in the 
environment to the calculated PNEC. 
III. EPA Analysis of the Petition 
In this section, the EPA provides an 
overview of the Agency’s substantive 
and technical review of the Petition. In 
section III.A., the EPA presents the 
details of the Agency’s review of 2-BEB. 
In section III.B., the EPA presents the 
Agency’s review of the inhalation 
exposure assessment for 2-BEB, which 
includes the Petitioner’s estimate of 
emissions of 2-BEB, modeling of 2-BEB 
air concentrations, and calculation of 
noncancer HQs. In section III.C., the 
EPA discusses the Agency’s review of 
oral and dermal exposure of 2-BEB. In 
section III.D., the EPA discusses the 
Agency’s review of human health effects 
of 2-BEB. In section III.E., the EPA 
presents the review of human health 
risk characterization for 2-BEB and 
relevant conclusions. In section III.F., 
the EPA presents the review of 
ecological risk characterization for 2- 
BEB. 
The EPA’s substantive review of the 
Petition described in this section 
indicates that the Petitioner has 
provided sufficient information to 
support the requested deletion of 2-BEB 
under the substantive criteria set forth 
in CAA section 112(b)(3)(C) and (D). 
Therefore, the EPA is determining that 
there are adequate data on the potential 
health and environmental effects of 2- 
BEB and further determining that 
emissions, ambient concentrations, 
bioaccumulation, or deposition of 2-BEB 
may not reasonably be anticipated to 
cause any adverse human health or 
environmental effects. 
A. Overview 
2-BEB falls within the CAA section 
112(b)(1) definition of the glycol ether 
category, which is a listed HAP as

Note, as described in section III.B.2. of this 
preamble, the EPA conducted the chronic 
noncancer inhalation risk screening analysis using 
both the ‘‘maximum’’ production volume estimate 
of 275,000 kg/yr and the ‘‘high end—unrealistic’’ 
production volume estimate of 2,300,000 kg/yr, 
which is over 8 times higher than the ‘‘maximum’’ 
value. In the EPA’s screening analysis, the acute 
noncancer risks were below levels of concern using 
either production value.

redefined by 40 CFR part 63, subpart C. 
It is a colorless liquid with low odor, a 
high boiling point (292 °C at 760 
mmHg), and low vapor pressure (2.09E– 
04 mmHg at 20 °C). It is miscible in 
water with moderate water solubility 
(106 mg/L at 20 °C). Additionally, 2-BEB 
has utility as a coalescing solvent for 
water-based, low VOC coatings. It can 
also be used as a replacement for 
phthalate-based plasticizers in caulking 
compounds and in some PVC 
formulations. 
The Petition states that 2-BEB 
released to the air has a degradation 
half-life of 11.8 hours with an overall 
environmental persistence of 21.6 
hours. The EPA evaluated the predicted 
half-life of 2-BEB in air and found these 
values to be reasonable. 
Based on the EPA’s review of the 
available information on 2-BEB, the 
Agency has concluded that inhalation 
and ingestion are the important routes 
of nonoccupational exposures that 
would result from 2-BEB emissions, and 
we have considered these two routes of 
exposure as well as some dermal 
exposures in evaluating the Petition. 
B. Inhalation Exposure Assessment 
1. Air Emissions Estimate 
As a first step in evaluating the 
Petitioner’s inhalation risk assessment, 
the EPA reviewed the Petitioner’s 
estimate of emissions of 2-BEB upon 
which the Petitioner based the exposure 
modeling. Upon review, the EPA 
determined the Petitioner appropriately 
identified the potential sources of 2-BEB 
air emissions from manufacturing, 
processing, and wastewater. The 
quantities of 2-BEB that the Petitioner 
assumed to be manufactured and 
processed, which are presented in 
section II.B.1. of this preamble, were 
reasonable maximum values that 
provided conservatively high emissions 
estimates. Specifically, the Petitioner 
indicated that, on average, 57,000 lbs/yr 
(26,000 kg/yr) of 2-BEB were produced 
from 2016 to mid-2019. The Petitioner 
estimated that their maximum 
production would be 600,000 lbs/yr 
(275,000 kg/yr), which is more than 10 
times current production. The EPA 
welcomes comment on this production 
assumption to ensure that it is 
reasonable and conservative. The 
Petitioner indicated in its June 29, 2021, 
letter that ‘‘based on its current 
understanding of production potential, 
the petitioner adhered to the 275,000 
kg/year figure for projected future 
growth and/or new product applications 
related to future delisting.’’
39
In the 
same letter, the Petitioner clarified that 
a previously mentioned production 
estimate of 5,000,000 lbs/yr (2.286,000 
kg/yr), which was presented as a ‘‘high- 
end wishful thinking estimate,’’ was 
deemed to be ‘‘unrealistic’’ given the 
Petitioner’s current knowledge of the 
potential customer base. The EPA also 
finds that the model inputs, 
assumptions, analysis, and methods 
used by the Petitioner to estimate 2-BEB 
air emissions are appropriate and 
provide reasonably conservative 
screening-level estimates of 2-BEB 
emissions and exposure estimates.
40
 
2. Modeling of 2-BEB Air 
Concentrations and Calculation of 
Noncancer Hazard Quotient 
The Petitioner performed the 
inhalation exposure assessment using 
the screening models discussed in 
section II.B. of this preamble. The 
Petitioner stated that a high level of 
conservatism was built into deriving 2- 
BEB exposure estimates. The 
conservative assumptions built into the 
analysis include: 
€Assumed open-top mixing and processing of 2-BEB during 
incorporation into water-based paints. 
Traditionally, this is a closed-unit 
operation, but for this worst-case 
assumption, the process is assumed to 
be an open process. 
€Assumed any release of 2-BEB into water does not undergo any treatment at 
Publicly Owned Treatment Works 
(POTWs). 
€Assumed all emissions during both manufacturing and processing are 
uncontrolled, such as when a thermal 
oxidizer is utilized. 
€Assumed emissions to be fugitive emissions and not point or stack 
sources. Stack or point emissions 
usually result in lower ambient ground- 
level concentrations compared with 
fugitive emissions modeling. 
€Assumed that a person exposed to 2-BEB lives in the vicinity where the 
chemical is both manufactured and 
processed. 
€Used theoretical maximum production values of 2-BEB for 
emissions calculations and modeling. 
(Performed the screen using both the 
‘‘Maximum’’ estimate of 275,000 kg/yr 
and the ‘‘High End—Unrealistic’’ 
estimate of 2,300,000 kg/yr). 
The EPA has determined that the 
Petitioner performed the dispersion 
modeling analysis following appropriate 
modeling guidance for a screening 
assessment. To verify the Petitioner’s 
results, the EPA conducted a screening 
assessment of the Petitioner’s 2-BEB 
emissions estimates using a Human 
Exposure Model (HEM) screening tool 
that uses data from American 
Meteorological Society/EPA Regulatory 
Model (AERMOD).
41
These assumptions 
included: 
€Assumption of fugitive/ground level emissions (1 m release height, 10 
m length, 10 m width). 
€100 m to the nearest residence. €100 m to the fenceline. €10x acute factor for releases directly to air, 1x acute factor for releases from 
water. 
Using the ‘‘maximum’’ production 
volume estimate of 275,000 kg/yr, the 
EPA’s screening assessment shows that 
the highest predicted maximum annual 
average off-site (i.e., beyond the fenceline, which was assumed to be 100 
m from the emissions source) 
concentration of 2-BEB would be 7E–4 
mg/m
3
. This concentration is 
approximately one order of magnitude 
higher than the highest concentration 
estimated by the Petitioner of 2.2E–5 
mg/m
3
. The primary reason the EPA’s 
screen resulted in a higher 
concentration is that the Agency used 
much more conservative fugitive release 
parameters, particularly for the fugitive 
release from water. The chronic 
noncancer HQ for 2-BEB, which was 
calculated by dividing the maximum 
annual concentration of 2-BEB from the 
EPA’s conservative screening analysis 
by the RfC for EGME (chronic noncancer 
HQ = 7E–4 mg/m
3
divided by 0.02 mg/ 
m
3
) is 3.6E–2. This is approximately one 
order of magnitude higher than the HQ 
estimated by the Petitioner of 1.1E–3. 
The primary reason the EPA’s screen 
resulted in a higher concentration is that 
the Agency used much more 
conservative fugitive release parameters. 
Regardless, both the Petitioner’s and the 
EPA’s assessments result in an HQ value 
for 2-BEB that is well below 1, which 
indicates that chronic noncancer risk is 
below levels of concern. Even using the 
‘‘high end—unrealistic’’ production 
volume estimate of 2,300,000 kg/yr in 
the screening assessment, the EPA finds 
that the chronic noncancer HQ for 2- 
BEB is below levels of concern at 1.6E– 
1. 
The EPA’s screening assessment also 
evaluated potential acute exposure

includes a 10x factor for emissions, the acute 
analysis was performed using the ‘‘maximum’’ 
production volume estimate only.

levels. As indicated above, a 10x acute 
factor was applied to emissions from 
manufacturing and processing to 
account for surges in emissions from the 
batch manufacturing and processing 
emissions points.
42
Assuming that 2- 
BEB slowly partitions into the air from 
wastewater throughout the year, a factor 
of 1x was used for acute air emissions 
from wastewater. Based on the EPA’s 
screening assessment of potential acute 
exposure levels, the Agency determined 
the maximum 1-hour concentrations to 
be 2.5E–4 mg/m
3
from manufacturing 
and processing and 3.2E–2 mg/m
3
from 
wastewater. The acute noncancer HQ for 
manufacturing and processing from the 
EPA’s screening analysis is 2.7E–2 and 
was calculated by dividing the acute 
concentration of 2-BEB from 
manufacturing and processing by the 
California Reference Exposure Level 
(REL) for EGME and then multiplying 
by an acute factor of 10 (acute 
noncancer HQ = 2.5E–4 mg/m

divided

times 10). The acute 
noncancer HQ for wastewater from the 
EPA’s screening analysis is 3.43E–1 and 
was calculated by dividing the acute 
concentration of 2-BEB from wastewater 
by the California REL for EGME (acute 
noncancer HQ = 3.2E–2 mg/m
3
divided 
by 0.093 mg/m
3
). The total acute HQ is 
3.7E–1 and was calculated as the sum of 
the HQ for manufacturing and 
processing and wastewater (total HQ = 
2.7E–2 + 3.43E–1). Even with 
conservative screening assumptions, the 
acute HQ (REL) for 2-BEB is below 1 
and, therefore, indicates that acute 
noncancer risk is below levels of 
concern. Based on the results of the 
acute inhalation study in rats (which 
showed no acute effects even at very 
high concentrations, discussed in 
section II.C. of this preamble), the 
Petitioner concluded that 2-BEB was not 
likely to cause acute effects. Thus, the 
Petitioner did not perform an evaluation 
of the acute inhalation risks. This 
largely agrees with the acute inhalation 
risk analysis that the EPA performed out 
of an abundance of caution. 
C. Oral and Dermal Exposure 
For oral and dermal exposures, the 
Petitioner estimated possible exposures 
of adults (18+ years), children (6–12 
years), and young children (1–5 years). 
Regarding workplace exposures and 
acute events resulting from workplace 
accidents, it is the EPA’s longstanding 
view that these kinds of exposures are 
beyond the scope of consideration for 
HAP delisting actions because CAA 
section 112(b)(3)(C) only references 
‘‘emissions, ambient concentrations, 
bioaccumulation, or deposition of the 
substance.
43
For all other scenarios, the 
Petitioner assumed its modeled ambient 
water concentration of 3.84E–11 mg/L. 
For the analysis, the EPA derived 
dermal and ingestion values for the 
exposure factors from the EPA’s 
Exposure Factors Handbook.
44
Although 
uptake via the oral and dermal routes 
likely have different absorption 
efficiencies, an oral exposure results in 
a first pass of the chemical substance 
through the liver while dermal exposure 
does not. The EPA’s estimates of uptake 
of 2-BEB for dermal and ingestion 
exposures are provided in table 4. For 
this evaluation, the EPA used the water 
concentration of 3.84E–11 mg/L, which 
is the same concentration assumed by 
the Petitioner. In the EPA’s evaluation, 
the possible uptakes via both routes 
were added to estimate a total possible 
internal dose. As a result of the findings 
of the acute oral study submitted by the 
Petitioner, the EPA believes that it is 
reasonable that an oral screening value 
would be protective against any 
potential acute dermal effects.

Human Health Effects of 2-BEB 
The EPA is unaware of any verified 
chronic or subchronic inhalation studies 
on 2-BEB. Due to the lack of health 
benchmarks or speciated exposure data 
for 2-BEB and other HAP in the glycol 
ethers category, the EPA used the EGME 
health benchmark to conduct an initial 
risk screen for human health effects that

A similar surrogate approach was applied to 
support the removal of the surfactant alcohol 
ethoxylates and their derivatives (SAED) from the 
glycol ethers category in the HAP list. In this case 
the subchronic RfC for 2-methoxy-1-propanol (MP) 
was used as a surrogate for SAED compounds (65

The EPA notes the Petitioner’s choice not to 
calculate an HED from the rat data citing species 
differences in the rate of formation of, and 
sensitivity to, the BAA metabolite, which is linked 
to hemolytic toxicity. The EPA additionally notes 
that the UF of 3 is representative of half an order 
of magnitude (i.e., the square root of 10) and multiplying two factors of 3 should lead to a 
product of 10. In a risk assessment done by the EPA 
using these factors, the total UF applied based on 
the Petitioner’s choices should have been 100, not 
90. Further, the EPA notes some of the choices the 
Petitioner made in the application of UFs. For 
was based on total glycol ethers 
exposure.
46
The EPA assumes that there 
is no relevant potential for risk from 
exposure to the glycol ethers category if 
no risk is found when assuming that 
100% of the glycol ethers exposure is to 
EGME. Therefore, the EPA finds the use 
of the RfC for EGME to be a conservative 
approach for assessing the potential for 
chronic risk from 2-BEB exposure. To 
also inform the EPA’s evaluation of the 
Petition, the Agency considered the 
worst-case toxicity scenario using EGME 
and the chemical substance specific 
data but did not rely on the route-to- 
route or EGBE-based approaches 
provided by the Petitioner. The EPA 
determined that the worst-case 
inhalation toxicity data for EGME and 
the submitted data concerning the 
potential for health effects from oral 
exposure to 2-BEB are sufficient data for 
deciding whether to delist 2-BEB. 
The Petitioner stated that it was 
unable to perform either chronic or 
subchronic inhalation studies due to the 
low volatility of 2-BEB (vapor pressure 
of 0.00029 mmHg at 20 °C). The boiling 
point of 2-BEB at 760 mm Hg (ambient 
pressure) is 282 °C. Based on this low 
vapor pressure and substantially high 
boiling point, and given that the 
manufacturing and conditions of use for 
water-based paints occur at ambient 
temperatures, the Petitioner concluded 
that it is unlikely that sufficient vapor 
of 2-BEB can be generated under 
conditions that represent those 
scenarios. The theoretical maximum 
saturated vapor concentration was 
calculated by the Petitioner to be 3.5 
mg/m
3
. 
As discussed in section II.C. of this 
preamble, the Petitioner relied on the 
inhalation data for EGBE to estimate the 
chronic risk of 2-BEB exposure to 
human health and, for comparison, 
provided a route-to-route extrapolation 
based on 2-BEB oral toxicity data. To 
address the uncertainty associated with 
estimates that are neither chemical nor 
route specific, the Petitioner also 
performed a worst-case toxicity analysis 
relying on the RfC for EGME, the most 
potent chemical with a RfC available 
from the EPA’s IRIS assessment program 
for the glycol ethers category. 
The results of the oral toxicity studies 
lead EPA to conclude that 2-BEB is not 
reasonably anticipated to cause 
developmental or reproductive toxicity 
at the doses tested (up to 5,000 ppm in 
diet), based on the lack of fetal loss or 
observed abnormalities. The RfC for 
EGME is based on reproductive effects. 
Adverse testicular effects from exposure 
to EGME were observed in rabbits and 
rats, with the LOAEL identified as 311 
mg/m
3
or 100 ppm. Based on the lack 
of any adverse effects observed at doses 
up to 1,500 ppm of 2-BEB, the EPA 
concludes that the use of the EGME 
toxicity value is sufficiently 
conservative to account for the potential 
for adverse reproductive, 
developmental, or other noncancer 
effects from exposure to 2-BEB. 
Further, the RfC for EGME of 0.02 mg/ 
m
3
is expected to sufficiently account 
for any adverse inhalation noncancer 
effects from potential exposure to 2- 
BEB’s metabolite EGBE.
47
The EPA 
considers using the RfC for EGME as 
more conservative than using the 
available chronic RfC for EGBE of 0.1 
mg/m3. Further, the RfC for EGME is 
expected to account for acute inhalation 
effects from EGBE as supported by 
available acute inhalation values for 
EGBE that include the acute inhalation 
Minimal Risk Level (MRL) of 6 ppm 
(28.8 mg/m

),
48
the acute inhalation 
REL of 4.7 mg/m3, and the 8-hr 
inhalation REL of 0.164 mg/m3.
49
 
As part of the three oral dietary 
repeat-dose studies (acute, 28-day, and 
90-day), the Petitioner performed a 
toxicokinetic evaluation to measure the 
parent chemical, 2-BEB, and two of its 
expected metabolites, EGBE and BAA, 
in the blood of the non-fasted animals 
using liquid chromatography with 
tandem mass spectrometry detection 
(LC/MS–MS). BAA has been identified 
as the metabolite responsible for the 
hemolytic toxicity of EGBE. While the 
data provided suggest the BAA 
metabolite may be responsible for 
observations of hemolytic toxicity at the 
high dose exposure to 2-BEB, the data 
do not demonstrate that the BAA 
metabolite is solely responsible for the 
full range of adverse effects observed at 
doses of 5000 ppm. 
In the 90-day study, the parent 
chemical (2-BEB) and two expected 
metabolites (EGBE and BAA) were also 
measured in urine using both LC/MS– 
MS and gas chromatography with 
tandem mass spectrometry detection 
(GC/MS–MS). 2-BEB was not detected 
in any of the treated blood samples. 
However, 2-BEB was detected in most of 
the treated urine samples, with one 
sample in the low-dose group and all 
samples in the higher-dose groups 
showing quantifiable levels. The levels 
of 2-BEB in 24-hr urine samples from 
male and female rats accounted for up 
to 0.294% and 0.599%, respectively, of 
the administered dose (the daily intake 
of 2-BEB) from all treatment groups. The 
Petitioner hypothesized that the positive 
results in urine may be attributed to 
contamination of urine samples with 2- 
BEB test diet. In all urine samples from 
treated rats, 2-BEB, EGBE, and BAA 
were all quantifiable. Toxicokinetic 
evaluations in blood showed the 
concentrations of BAA and EGBE were 
linear across dose levels in both male 
and female rats. While BAA showed a 
linear relationship across dose levels in 
female rats, non-detects in treated 
females prevented a toxicokinetic 
analysis for EGBE. However, the 
toxicokinetic evaluations in urine 
showed that the measured 
concentrations of 2-BEB, EGBE, and 
BAA were linear across dose levels in 
both male and female rats. 
The EPA performed a separate 
evaluation of the submitted data and the 
Petitioner’s estimate of an RfD based on 
2-BEB toxicity data. Based on this 
evaluation, the EPA has determined that 
the worst-case inhalation toxicity data 
for EGME and the submitted data 
concerning the potential for health 
effects from oral exposure to 2-BEB are 
sufficient data for deciding whether to 
delist 2-BEB. 
Using the rat point of departure of 100 
mg/kg/day, the EPA calculated the HED 
based on the available information and 
the recommendations provided in EPA 
guidance.
50
The resulting HED was 
estimated to be 24 mg/kg/day. The EPA 
also applied differing UFs to this HED. 
However, the EPA agreed with the 
Petitioner’s selection of the NOAEL 
based on the limited data available for 
2-BEB.

of 10 based on the absence of human 
data available for 2-BEB, the potential 
for interindividual differences in 
metabolism and excretion of the BAA 
metabolite, and the potential for 
interindividual susceptibility to the 
benzoic acid metabolite, the metabolite 
of 2-BEB formed in addition to EGBE. 
The EPA adjusted the UF
A
from 3 to 1 
based on the Agency’s application of 
default dosimetry methods to calculate 
the HED and evidence that animals may 
be more sensitive than humans to 2- 
BEB’s benzoic acid, EGBE, and BAA 
metabolites that may drive the observed 
oral toxicity of 2-BEB. This is consistent 
with the application of the UF
A
in the 
IRIS assessments available for EGBE and 
benzoic acid. Finally, the EPA adjusted 
the UF
D
from 3 to 10 to address the 
uncertainty attributable to the very 
limited database available on the 
toxicity of 2-BEB. 
In summary, to screen for the 
potential for oral risk from 2-BEB, the 
EPA used the Petitioner’s data and 
applied more conservative values. 
Specifically, the EPA used the HED of 
24 mg/kg/day and applied a cumulative 
UF of 1,000 (UF
S
= 10, UF
H
= 10, UF
A
 
= 1, and UF
D
= 10). This resulted in an 
oral screening value of 0.024 mg/kg/day. 
This screening value is expected to be 
protective of effects from 2-BEB’s 
metabolites. Benzoic acid has an 
available chronic RfD of 4 mg/kg/day, 
whereas EGBE has an available 
intermediate MRL of 0.07 mg/kg/day. 
The 2-BEB chronic oral screening value 
is expected to also be protective of acute 
oral risk from EGBE, based on the 
availability of an acute oral MRL from 
the Agency of Toxic Substances and 
Disease Registry (ATSDR) for EGBE of 
0.4 mg/kg/day. 
The EPA evaluated the available 
information on 2-BEB genotoxicity and 
relied on this information to evaluate 
the evidence regarding the potential for 
2-BEB to cause cancer in humans. 
Currently, the EPA is not aware of any 
available two-year carcinogenicity study 
for 2-BEB. However, due to consistent 
evidence of non-genotoxicity in vitro, 
lack of genotoxicity or lesions observed 
in repeated dose studies in vivo, and 
supplemental evidence regarding a lack 
of carcinogenicity for 2-BEB’s 
metabolites, the EPA has concluded that 
the available evidence suggests that 2- 
BEB is unlikely to be a carcinogen at 
doses below the derived RfC and RfD. 
E. Human Health Risk Characterization 
and Conclusions 
To characterize the noncancer risk 
associated with exposure to 2-BEB or 
EGME, we calculated a HQ. For EGME, 
the inhalation HQ was developed by 
comparing the modeled level of 
exposure to the RfC for EGME. For 2- 
BEB, the HQ was calculated by 
comparing the modeled level of 
exposure to the EPA-estimated RfD for 
2-BEB. If the HQ is less than 1, the 
reference level is not exceeded, and 
adverse noncancer health effects are 
unlikely. 
The EPA has determined that the use 
of the RfC for EGME is health 
conservative. The Petitioner points out 
that the critical effect used to derive the 
RfC for EGME is a potential effect on the 
testes, but that no effect on the testes 
has been observed with 2-BEB. 
Similarly, the EPA finds that there is no 
data to support that 2-BEB would be 
expected to be equal to or greater in 
toxicity than EGME. In addition, the 
EGME RfC criterion includes margins of 
safety built into the IRIS RfC (i.e., any needed UFs to address sensitive 
subpopulations and other factors) and, 
therefore, accounts for sensitive 
subpopulations. 
The EPA also finds that the Petitioner 
performed the dispersion modeling 
analysis following appropriate modeling 
guidance for a screening assessment. To 
verify the Petitioner’s results, the EPA 
conducted a screening assessment using 
the Petitioner’s 2-BEB emissions 
estimates, a HEM screening tool that 
uses data from AERMOD, and 
conservative assumptions, including the 
use of the RfC for EGME.
52
 
Using the ‘‘maximum’’ production 
volume estimate of 275,000 kg/yr, the 
HQ for 2-BEB based on the EPA’s 
conservative screening analysis, 
3.6E¥2, is approximately one order of 
magnitude higher than the HQ 
estimated by the Petitioner of 1.1E¥3. 
The primary reason the EPA’s screen 
resulted in a higher concentration is that 
the Agency used much more 
conservative fugitive release parameters. 
Regardless, both screens result in an HQ 
value for 2-BEB that is well below 1 
and, therefore, indicate that chronic 
noncancer risk is below the presumed 
level of concern. In addition, the EPA 
performed the chronic noncancer screen 
using the ‘‘high end—unrealistic’’ 
production volume estimate of 
2,300,000 kg/yr and the HQ for 2-BEB 
based on the same conservative 
screening values was still below 1 at 
1.6E¥1. 
The EPA’s screen also included an 
estimate of the acute noncancer risk 
using the REL for EGME of 0.093 mg/ 
m
3
. As indicated above, a 10x acute 
factor was applied to emissions from 
manufacturing and processing to 
account for surges in emissions from the 
batch manufacturing and processing 
emissions points (note that, since the 
acute screen already includes a 10x 
factor for emissions, the acute analysis 
was performed using the ‘‘maximum’’ 
production volume estimate only). 
Since the EPA assumes that 2-BEB 
slowly partitions into the air from the 
water throughout the year, a factor of 1x 
was used for acute air emissions from 
water. Table 5 shows the calculations of 
the acute HQs based on the REL from 
the EPA’s screen:

Even with conservative screening 
assumptions, the acute HQ (REL) for 2- 
BEB is well below 1 and, therefore, 
indicates that acute noncancer risk is 
below levels of concern. 
In summary, the Petitioner’s modeling 
analysis demonstrated that, using 
conservative assumptions, the 
maximum noncancer HQ is well below 
1 and therefore below levels of concern. 
This finding was confirmed by the 
EPA’s own screening analysis. In 
addition, the EPA’s screening analysis 
indicated that the acute HQ, based on 
the maximum 1-hour concentration and 
the application of acute factors, was also 
below 1 and therefore below levels of 
concern. Therefore, the EPA does not 
anticipate inhalation exposure to 2-BEB 
to occur at levels of concern for human 
health. 
Regarding ingestion and dermal 
exposures, the Petitioner summarizes 
various HQs it estimated for ingestion 
and dermal exposures in table 17 of the 
Petition. None exceed 1.29E¥11 
(youngest age group, ingestion 
exposure). The Petitioner used an RfD of 
0.19 based on 2-BEB’s molar equivalent 
of EGBE. The EPA also performed a 
seperate risk screening analysis for oral 
and dermal expsoure to 2-BEB. As 
shown in the last row of table 6, the 
total HQs for dermal and ingestion 
exposures are well below 1 and 
therefore below levels of concern. The 
screening level the EPA used to 
determine 2-BEB’s ingestion HQ is the 
EPA’s screening oral value based on the 
Petitioner’s 2-BEB toxicity data of 0.024 
mg/kg/day. Based on the EPA’s analysis, 
the Agency expects that maximum 
exposures to 2-BEB via ingestion of 
water contaminated with 2-BEB from air 
releases are unlikely to exceed 0.024 
mg/kg/day. The resulting HQs for adults 
and children are well below 1, ranging 
from 5.96E¥11 to 8.75E¥11. Therefore, 
the EPA’s analysis of dermal and 
ingestion exposures confirms the 
Petitioner’s findings.

evaluation of information presented in 
the Petition, data made available after 
the submission of the Petition, and the 
Agency’s own analyses, we have made 
an initial determination that emissions, 
ambient concentrations, 
bioaccumulation, or deposition of 2-BEB 
may not reasonably be anticipated to 
cause any adverse effects to human 
health. 
F. Ecological Risk Characterization and 
Conclusions 
2-BEB has moderate solubility in 
water (106 mg/L) and low vapor 
pressure. These properties lead to the 
potential for 2-BEB air emissions to 
deposit into water systems, which can 
result in ecological exposure. 
Considering the mammalian data on 
metabolism and the predicted fish 
biotransformation, the EPA expects that 
2-BEB would be quickly metabolized in 
fish and, therefore, agrees with the 
Petitioner’s finding that 2-BEB would be 
unlikely to bioaccumulate in aquatic 
food chains. In addition, based on the 
EQC multimedia fugacity modeling 
conducted by the Petitioner, the EPA 
agrees that 2-BEB is expected to readily 
degrade (hydrolyze) after release to air 
and deposition to soils and surface 
waters. 
The exposure estimates for the 
environment were based on 
concentrations predicted by the 
Equilibrium Partitioning (EQP) model 
worst-case projected emissions to air 
only. The EPA has summarized the 
Petitioner’s data from appendix 2, tables 
3 and 4 in table 7, below. The HQ values 
for water and soil in the last row of table 
7 are 10 orders of magnitude below the 
HQ of 1. Even though the EPA considers 
the Petitioner’s exposure estimates to be 
uncertain, it is unlikely that 
environmental concentrations were 
underestimated by 10 orders of 
magnitude. Thus, the very low HQs 
indicate that the potential for adverse 
environmental effects is too low to be of 
concern.

G. Conclusions 
The proposal to grant the Petition is 
based on the EPA’s evaluation of the 
Petition and available information 
concerning the potential hazards and 
projected exposures to 2-BEB.
55
The 
EPA made an initial determination that 
there are adequate data on the health 
and environmental effects of 2-BEB to 
determine that emissions, ambient 
concentrations, bioaccumulation, or 
deposition of 2-BEB may not reasonably 
be anticipated to cause adverse human 
health or environmental effects. This 
action therefore includes the EPA’s 
detailed rationale for proposing to grant 
the Petition to delete 2-BEB from the 
glycol ethers category of HAP under 
CAA section 112(b)(1). If, after 
opportunity for public comment and 
review of those comments, the EPA 
makes the final determination to grant 
the Petition, the deletion of 2-BEB will 
be codified in 40 CFR part 63, subpart 
C. 
In section III.D., the EPA also 
discussed uncertainty with respect to 
available evidence of the risk of 2-BEB. 
Uncertainty is an inherent part of risk 
assessment that requires the integration 
of multiple factors and predictions of 
risk that are not directly observable. For 
decisions that are based largely on risk 
assessments, some degree of uncertainty 
is acceptable and unavoidable. 
To this end, the risk assessment 
applies conservative toxicity and 
exposure assumptions to bias potential 
error toward overstating human and 
ecological health effects. Thus, the EPA 
is confident that even when we consider 
the uncertainties in the Petition’s initial 
assessment and in the additional 
analyses by the EPA and the Petitioner, 
the results are more likely to 
overestimate rather than underestimate 
true exposures and risks.
56
The EPA 
long maintained that CAA section 
112(b)(3)(C) does not require absolute 
certainty that a pollutant will not cause 
adverse effects on human health or the 
environment before it may be deleted 
from the HAP list. For example, the EPA 
has previously explained that the terms 
‘‘adequate’’ and ‘‘reasonably’’ in CAA 
section 112(b)(3)(C) indicate that the 
Agency must weigh the potential 
uncertainties and the likely significance 
of any projections, assessments, and 
estimations.
57
 
Uncertainty arises for several reasons 
in the risk assessment for 2-BEB, 
including that the physicochemical 
properties of 2-BEB make it difficult to 
directly assess the inhalation toxicity. 
Further, the use of a worst-case toxicity 
IRIS value for EGME as the source of the 
human health effects decision criteria, 
while considered a conservative 
approach, is imperfect and leads to 
uncertainty in characterizing the risk of 
inhalation exposure to 2-BEB. 
Additionally, there are gaps in the 
database of toxicity information 
available for 2-BEB with little to no 
scientific data available outside of what 
the Petitioner provided. No chronic oral 
exposure study is available for 2-BEB. 
While the potential for oral or dermal 
risk was estimated to be very low based 
on the data available, this represents an 
area of uncertainty addressed in part by 
the application of the 10-fold 
subchronic UF
S
. Further, the adverse 
health outcomes observed in the 90-day 
oral toxicity study mirror those 
observed in animals for 2-BEB’s 
metabolite, benzoic acid. In the IRIS 
assessment of benzoic acid,
58
animals 
were considered to be a poor predictor 
of human toxicity levels based on the 
observation of effects in chronic animal 
studies at levels generally recognized as 
safe for humans by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA). However, the 
RfD for benzoic acid was set in 1988 
based on a study conducted by the FDA 
in 1973 and is likely out of date. The 
EPA also recognizes that uncertainty 
exists in the EQC multimedia fugacity 
model used to predict the fate and 
transport of 2-BEB in the environment. 
These models are simplifications of 
reality, and some variables are 
excluded. For example, in the EQC 
model, the characteristics of the 
environment are fixed to facilitate 
chemical-to-chemical comparison.
59
 
The EPA believes these uncertainties are 
largely addressed by using the reference 
value for the more toxic EGME (which 
incorporates UFs) and the conservative 
assumptions used in the emissions and 
exposure assessments. Taken together, 
these assumptions bias any potential 
error towards overstating the human 
health effects, even considering the 
uncertainties described above. 
Regarding carcinogenicity, the 
information available to the EPA 
currently indicates a lack of 
genotoxicity for 2-BEB and no evidence 
suggests carcinogenicity at levels below 
the oral noncancer screening level of 
0.024 mg/kg/day and the EGME RfC of 
0.02 mg/m
3
. If additional information 
on 2-BEB is provided to the EPA 
between the proposal and the final 
action on this delisting decision, the 
Agency expects to evaluate and peer- 
review such information. 
Additionally, regarding 
environmental effects, the HQ values for 
water and soil are 10 orders of 
magnitude below the HQ of 1. Even 
though the EPA considers the 
Petitioner’s exposure estimates to be 
uncertain, it is unlikely that

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with PROPOSALS59782 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Proposed Rules environmental concentrations of 2-BEB 
were underestimated by 10 orders of 
magnitude. Thus, the EPA reasonably 
expects that the potential for adverse 
environmental effects posed by 
emissions of 2-BEB would be low. 
In conclusion, upon the showing 
made by the Petitioner, the EPA has 
made an initial determination that there 
are adequate data on the potential 
health and environmental effects of 2- 
BEB. Based on this data, the EPA has 
determined that emissions, ambient 
concentrations, bioaccumulation, or 
deposition of 2-BEB may not reasonably 
be anticipated to cause any adverse 
effects to the human health or adverse 
environmental effects. Therefore, the 
EPA proposes to grant the Petition and 
delete 2-BEB from the glycol ethers 
category of the HAP list. 
IV. Proposed Amendments to 40 CFR 
Part 63, Subpart C 
The EPA is proposing to amend 40 
CFR part 63, subpart C to codify the 
deletion of 2-BEB from the glycol ethers 
category in the HAP list established by 
42 U.S.C. 7412(b)(1). Additionally, the 
EPA intends to reorganize 40 CFR part 
63, subpart C to provide clarity and 
allow space for future amendments. The 
EPA is not, however, reopening for 
comment any of the previous decisions 
currently codified in 40 CFR part 63, 
subpart C. The EPA is making a 
ministerial, administrative revision to 
better reorganize the subpart and is not 
reexamining either the broader 
regulatory framework or specified 
earlier delisting decisions. 
Specifically, the EPA intends to 
reorganize subpart C to dedicate 40 CFR 
63.61 to deletions from the HAP list and 
40 CFR 63.62 to additions to the HAP 
list. Under 40 CFR 63.61, the EPA 
intends to begin each paragraph with a 
paragraph heading that states the 
delisted HAP. Under 40 CFR 63.62, the 
EPA intends to begin each paragraph 
with a heading that states the listed 
HAP. 
Additionally, the EPA intends to 
revise the entry for EGBE to state: 
‘‘deleted from the glycol ethers category 
in the list of hazardous air pollutants 
established by 42 U.S.C. 7412(b)(1)’’ 
instead of ‘‘deleted from the list of 
hazardous air pollutants established by 
42 U.S.C. 7412(b)(1).’’ The EPA is not, 
however, reopening for comment the 
previous delisting decision for EGBE. 
A memorandum showing the rule 
edits that would be necessary to 
incorporate the changes to 40 CFR part 
63, subpart C is available in the docket 
for this rulemaking (Docket ID No. EPA– 
HQ–OAR–2024–0392). 
V. Statutory and Executive Order 
Reviews 
A. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory 
Planning and Review and Executive 
Order 13563: Improving Regulation and 
Regulatory Review 
This action is not a significant 
regulatory action and was therefore not 
submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) for review. 
B. Executive Order 14192: Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation 
This action is expected to be an 
Executive Order 14192 deregulatory 
action. This proposed rule is expected 
to provide burden reduction by 
removing a compound from the HAP 
list, therefore decreasing the regulatory 
burden of any facility that uses or plans 
to use the compound. 
C. Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) 
This action does not impose an 
information collection burden under the 
PRA. The final action will remove 2- 
BEB from the CAA section 112(b)(1) 
HAP list and, therefore, eliminate the 
need for information collection under 
the CAA. 
D. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
I certify that this action will not have 
a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities 
under the RFA. In making this 
determination, the EPA concludes that 
the impact of concern for this rule is any 
significant adverse economic impact on 
small entities and that the Agency is 
certifying that this rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities 
because the rule relieves regulatory 
burden on the small entities subject to 
the rule. The acceptance of this proposal 
would delist a HAP currently listed 
under CAA section 112(b)(1); therefore, 
the regulatory burden would decrease. 
The EPA has therefore concluded that 
this action would relieve regulatory 
burden for all directly regulated small 
entities. 
E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
(UMRA) 
This action does not contain an 
unfunded mandate as described in 
UMRA, 2 U.S.C. 1531–1538, and does 
not significantly or uniquely affect small 
governments. The action imposes no 
enforceable duty on any state, local or 
Tribal governments or the private sector. 
F. Executive Order 13132: Federalism 
This action does not have federalism 
implications. It will not have substantial 
direct effects on the states, on the 
relationship between the national 
government and the states, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
G. Executive Order 13175: Consultation 
and Coordination With Indian Tribal 
Governments 
This action does not have Tribal 
implications as specified in Executive 
Order 13175. It will not have substantial 
direct effects on Tribal governments, on 
the relationship between the Federal 
government and Indian Tribes, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities between the Federal 
government and Indian Tribes, as 
specified in Executive Order 13175. 
Thus, Executive Order 13175 does not 
apply to this action. 
H. Executive Order 13045: Protection of 
Children From Environmental Health 
Risks and Safety Risks 
Executive Order 13045 directs Federal 
agencies to include an evaluation of the 
health and safety effects of the planned 
regulation on children and explain why 
the regulation is preferable to 
potentially effective and reasonably 
feasible alternatives. This action is not 
subject to Executive Order 13045 
because it is not a significant regulatory 
action under section 3(f)(1) of Executive 
Order 12866, and because the EPA does 
not believe the environmental health or 
safety risks addressed by this action 
present a disproportionate risk to 
children. This determination is based on 
the fact that the RfC is determined to be 
protective of sensitive sub-populations, 
including children. 
EPA’s Policy on Children’s Health applies to this action. Section III.E. of 
this preamble describes the analyses 
conducted to determine the human 
health impacts of 2-BEB for all 
populations, including children. We 
have made an initial determination that 
2-BEB may not reasonably be 
anticipated to cause any adverse effects 
to human health, including children. 
I. Executive Order 13211: Actions 
Concerning Regulations That 
Significantly Affect Energy Supply, 
Distribution, or Use 
This action is not subject to Executive 
Order 13211, because it is not a 
significant regulatory action under 
Executive Order 12866.

Synopsis 
In the document, the Space Bureau 
seeks to refresh the record on proposed 
rules to permit the use of additional 
frequency bands for non-geostationary 
orbit (‘‘NGSO’’) Fixed Satellite Service 
(‘‘FSS’’) satellites to communicate with 
Earth Stations in Motion (‘‘ESIMs’’). The 
Commission sought comment in 2020 
on proposals that would allow NGSO 
FSS systems to communicate with 
ESIMs in the 28.35–28.6 GHz band. The 
comment period closed over five years

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with PROPOSALS59784 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Proposed Rules ago. To ensure that the Commission has 
the benefit of current information, 
including any developments relating to 
these issues since the release of the 
underlying NGSO ESIM FNPRM, we invite interested parties to update the 
record as discussed below. 
Background. In 2018, the Commission adopted rules governing 
communications for ESIMs with 
geostationary orbit (‘‘GSO’’) satellites. 
At that time, the Commission also 
sought comment on allowing ESIMs to 
operate in all the frequency bands in 
which earth stations at fixed locations 
operating in GSO fixed satellite service 
(‘‘FSS’’) satellite networks can be 
blanket-licensed. Later that same year, 
the Commission adopted a Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that 
sought comment on expanding the 
Commission’s ESIM rules to cover 
communications with NGSO FSS 
satellites. 
In 2020, the Commission adopted 
rules that allowed for NGSO FSS 
operations of ESIMs in certain bands 
and opened up additional frequency 
bands for GSO FSS ESIM use. At that 
time, the Commission permitted NGSO 
FSS ESIMs in the 28.4–28.6 GHz subject 
to compliance with future 
determinations but deferred 
consideration on permitting NGSO FSS 
ESIMs in the 28.35–28.4 GHz band, and 
sought comment to further address 
issues raised by commenters in the 
record and to allow for additional study 
of out-of-band emissions issues. 
Since the Commission last sought 
comment on permitting NGSO FSS 
ESIMs in the entirety of the 28.35–28.6 
GHz band, multiple parties have met 
with the Commission staff on this 
matter. For instance, Verizon met with 
Commission staff in 2023 to discuss its 
concerns related to out-of-band 
emissions limits and the potential 
interference to terrestrial services in the 
27.5–28.35 GHz adjacent band and a 
proposal to harmonize part 25 out-of- 
band emissions limits for NGSO ESIMs 
with out-of-band emission limits for 
terrestrial wireless operations, given the 
terrestrial operations in the 27.5–28.35 
GHz band. 
Because the NGSO ESIM FNPRM 
comment period closed more than five 
years ago, and in recognition of the 
subsequent changes to the terrestrial 
and ESIM environments during that 
period, we seek to refresh the record to 
ensure the record in this proceeding is 
current and complete. 
Request for Additional Comment. 
Accordingly, the Space Bureau invites 
all stakeholders to update the record 
after reviewing the specific proposals, 
underlying analysis, and questions 
contained in the NGSO ESIM FNPRM, as 
well as the existing record in this 
proceeding. The NGSO ESIM FNPRM 
presented a number of questions related 
to the current out of band emissions 
limits in § 25.202(f) and whether they 
would be sufficient to protect Upper 
Microwave Flexible Use Service 
(UMFUS) operations in the 27.5–28.35 
GHz band. In addition, the NGSO ESIM 
FNPRM sought comment on what level of interference generated by out-of-band 
emissions from ESIM operations with 
NGSO space stations above 28.35 GHz 
would be acceptable for UMFUS 
receivers operating below 28.35 GHz 
without unduly constraining ESIM 
operations above 28.35 GHz. The NGSO 
ESIM FNPRM also sought comment on 
other issues related to harmful 
interference and whether UMFUS 
operators are developing any equipment 
with characteristics that make them less 
susceptible to adjacent band users. In 
addition to these questions, the NGSO 
ESIM FNPRM sought comment on issues 
related to guard bands, minimum 
elevation angle, aggregation 
interference, and how to specify out-of- 
band emissions limits. 
We encourage interested parties to 
submit new or additional relevant 
information since the close of the 
previous comment period related to 
these and other questions laid out in the 
NGSO ESIM FNPRM. In addition, 
commenters are encouraged to submit 
new or additional relevant information 
about the present state of the UMFUS 
and ESIM environments, including the 
current or anticipated uses of these 
services. In addition, commenters are 
encouraged to provide any information 
gained since the close of the previous 
comment period related to the intensity 
of use of ESIMs in the 28.35–28.6 GHz 
band by both GSO and NGSO operators, 
as permitted. We also encourage 
commenters to provide any additional 
or new studies since the close of the 
previous comment period 
demonstrating protection criteria for 
ESIMs in the 28.35–28.6 GHz band that 
would protect adjacent band operations 
in the 27.5–28.35 GHz band.

Synopsis 
1. In the document, the Space Bureau 
extends the deadlines for filing 
comments and reply comments for the 
Facilitating More Intensive Use of 
Upper Microwave Spectrum Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking (UMFUS NPRM) 
in SB Docket No. 25–305 to January 20, 
2026 and February 18, 2026, 
respectively. 
2. On October 29, 2025, the Federal 
Communications Commission 
(Commission) released the UMFUS 
NPRM seeking comment on section 25.136 of the Commission’s rules, which 
governs spectrum sharing between the 
terrestrial Upper Microwave Flexible 
Use Service and the Fixed Satellite 
Service. The UMFUS NPRM specified 
that comments and reply comments 
would be due 30 and 60 days after 
Federal Register publication. That 
publication occurred on December 3, 
2025, announcing a comment filing 
deadline of January 2, 2026 and a reply 
comment date of February 2, 2026. 
3. On December 11, 2025, CTIA 
requested extension of the comment and 
reply comment filing deadlines until 
January 20, 2026 and February 18, 2026. 
In its request, CTIA begins by noting 
that the issues in the UMFUS NPRM are 
complex and intersect with proposals 
contained in the simultaneously- 
adopted Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
addressing Space Modernization 
(Modernization NPRM), which has a 
comment deadline of January 20, 2026 
and a reply comment deadline of 
February 18, 2026. CTIA argues that that 
alignment of the pleading cycles for the 
UMFUS NPRM and the Modernization 
NPRM would allow commenters to provide integrated, consistent, and 
nonduplicative analyses in both 
proceedings, as well as a more fulsome 
record for the Commission to review. 
CTIA also argues that the brief extension 
requested would not harm any other 
party in this proceeding, alter any 
substantive rights, or prejudice any 
participant. Finally, CTIA states that the 
requested deadline changes—extending 
the comment window by less than three 
weeks and the reply comment window 
by just over two weeks—would not 
cause significant delay or impede 
Commission consideration or timelines, 
as the new dates align with already- 
established dates for the Modernization 
NPRM. 
4. As set forth in § 1.46(a) of the 
Commission’s rules, the Commission’s 
policy is that extensions of time shall 
not be routinely granted. The Space 
Bureau finds, however, that CTIA has 
provided sufficient justification to 
warrant grant of their requested 
extension. An extension would enable 
interested parties to present more 
complete comments to the Commission, 
and the Space Bureau agrees with CTIA 
that the extension should not 
disadvantage any party or cause 
significant delay in the resolution of this 
proceeding.

Food and Nutrition Service 
Title: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Reporting of 
Lottery and Gambling, and Resource 
Verification. 
OMB Control Number: 0584–0621. 
Summary of Collection: In accordance 
with section 4009 of the Agricultural 
Act of 2014, households in which 
members receive substantial lottery and 
gambling winnings are ineligible for 
SNAP until they meet allowable 
financial resources and income 
eligibility requirements. Substantial 
winnings are defined as winnings that 
are equal to or greater than the resource 
limit for elderly or disabled households 
as defined in 7 CFR 273.8(b). States are 
also required to work cooperatively with 
entities responsible for gaming in their 
State to identify individuals or 
households with substantial winnings. 
SNAP individuals or households must 
report substantial winnings to State 
SNAP agencies. 
Need and Use of the Information: 
State SNAP agencies are required, to the 
maximum extent practicable, to 
establish cooperative agreements with 
gaming entities within the State to 
identify SNAP recipients with 
substantial winnings. Gaming entities 
(both State public agency and private 
business gaming entities) that entered 
into the cooperative agreements share 
information with the State SNAP agency 
on individuals within their gaming 
establishment who win significant 
amounts. The regulations define 
significant amount as being equal to or 
greater than the maximum allowable 
resource limit for all elderly and 
disabled SNAP households, as outlined 
in 7 CFR 273.8(b)(1). State SNAP 
agencies must also require SNAP 
households to report substantial lottery 
and gambling winnings. State SNAP 
agencies use the information on 
substantial winnings collected through 
these cooperative agreements and 
through household reporting to assess 
whether SNAP households are no longer 
eligible for benefits. 
State SNAP agencies that collect 
information from households 
concerning their available resources use 
this information to determine whether 
households meet the SNAP resource 
limit for program eligibility. All States 
must verify this information if 
questionable, and some States elect to 
verify this information in other 
circumstances as well.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Title: Permit to Obtain Specimens of Condemned or Other Inedible Materials 
from Official Establishments. 
OMB Number: 0583–0180. 
Type of Request: Renewal of an 
approved information collection. 
Abstract: FSIS has been delegated the authority to exercise the functions of the 
Secretary (7 CFR 2.18, 2.53) as specified 
in the Federal Meat Inspection Act 
(FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601, et seq.), the 
Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) 
(21 U.S.C. 451, et seq.), and the Egg 
Products Inspection Act (EPIA) (21 
U.S.C. 1031, et seq.). These statutes 
mandate that FSIS protect the public by 
verifying that meat, poultry, and egg 
products are safe, wholesome, and 
properly labeled. 
FSIS is requesting a renewal for the 
approved information collection 
regarding applicants that want to obtain 
specimens of condemned or other 
inedible materials from official 
establishments. The approval for this 
information collection will expire on 
March 31, 2026. FSIS is making no 
changes to the information collection. 
FSIS requires any person desiring 
specimens of condemned or other 
inedible materials, including embryos 
and specimens of animal parasites, to 
file a written application on the FSIS 
Form 6700–2, ‘‘Application and Permit 
to Obtain Specimens from Official 
Establishments’’ (9 CFR 314.9(a)). The 
applicant must indicate the purpose for 
the specimens and arrange with and 
receive permission from the official 
establishment to obtain the specimens. 
Under the regulations, official 
establishments may release specimens 
for educational, research, or other 
nonfood purposes under the permit 
issued by the inspector in charge. The 
applicant agrees that the collection and 
handling of the specimens will be at 
such time and place and in such a 
manner as not to interfere with 
inspection or to cause any objectionable 
condition. 
FSIS has made the following 
estimates as part of an information 
collection assessment. 
Estimate of Burden: FSIS estimates 
that it takes respondents an average of 
10 minutes to complete the form. 
Respondents: Researchers. Estimated Number of Respondents: 
1,642. 
Estimated Number of Annual 
Responses per Respondent: 1. 
Estimated Total Annual Burden on 
Respondents: 274 hours. All responses to this notice will be 
summarized and included in the request 
for OMB approval. All comments will 
also become a matter of public record. 
Copies of this information collection 
assessment can be obtained from Gina 
Kouba, Office of Policy and Program 
Development, Food Safety and 
Inspection Service, USDA, 1400 
Independence Avenue SW, Mailstop 
3758, South Building, Washington, DC

Comments are invited on: (a) whether 
the proposed collection of information 
is necessary for the proper performance 
of FSIS’ functions, including whether 
the information will have practical 
utility; (b) the accuracy of FSIS’ estimate 
of the burden of the proposed collection 
of information, including the validity of 
the method and assumptions used; (c)

WTO Agricultural Quantity-Based 
Safeguard Trigger Levels 
AGENCY: Foreign Agricultural Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
ACTION: Notice of product coverage and trigger levels for safeguard measures 
provided for in the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) Agreement on 
Agriculture. 
SUMMARY: This notice lists the updated quantity-based trigger levels for 
products which may be subject to 
additional import duties under the 
safeguard provisions of the WTO 
Agreement on Agriculture. This notice 
also includes the relevant period 
applicable for the trigger levels on each 
of the listed products. 
DATES: This notice is applicable on December 22, 2025. 
ADDRESSES: Multilateral Affairs Division, Trade Policy and Geographic 
Affairs, Foreign Agricultural Service, 
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Stop

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
USDA Sugar Import Program, fas-rmb- 
sugars.sugars@usda.gov. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Article 5 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture 
provides that additional import duties 
may be imposed on imports of products 
subject to tariffication as a result of the 
Uruguay Round, if certain conditions 
are met. The agreement permits 
additional duties to be charged if the 
price of an individual shipment of 
imported products falls below the 
average price for similar goods imported 
during the years 1986–88 by a specified 
percentage. It also permits additional 
duties when the volume of imports of 
that product exceeds the sum of (1) a 
base trigger level multiplied by the 
average of the last three years of 
available import data and (2) the change 
in yearly consumption in the most 
recent year for which data are available 
(provided that the final trigger level is 
not less than 105 percent of the three- 
year import average). The base trigger 
level is set at 105, 110, or 125 percent 
of the three-year import average, 
depending on the percentage of 
domestic consumption that is 
represented by imports. These 
additional duties may not be imposed 
on quantities for which minimum or 
current access commitments were made 
during the Uruguay Round negotiations, 
and only one type of safeguard, price or 
quantity, may be applied at any given 
time to an article. 
Section 405 of the Uruguay Round 
Agreements Act requires that the 
President cause to be published in the 
Federal Register information regarding 
the price and quantity safeguards, 
including the quantity trigger levels, 
which must be updated annually based 
upon import levels during the most 
recent 3 years. The President delegated 
this duty to the Secretary of Agriculture 
in Presidential Proclamation No. 6763, 
dated December 23, 1994, 60 FR 1007 
(Jan. 4, 1995). The Secretary of 
Agriculture further delegated this duty, 
which lies with the Administrator of the 
Foreign Agricultural Service (7 CFR 
2.601(a)(42)). The Annex to this notice 
contains the updated quantity trigger 
levels, consistent with the provisions of 
Article 5. 
Additional information on the 
products subject to safeguards and the 
additional duties which may apply can 
be found in subchapter IV of Chapter 99 
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
the United States (2024) and in the 
Secretary of Agriculture’s Notice of 
Uruguay Round Agricultural Safeguard 
Trigger Levels, published in the Federal 
Register at 60 FR 427 (Jan. 4, 1995). Notice: As provided in Section 405 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, 
consistent with Article 5 of the WTO 
Agreement on Agriculture, the safeguard 
quantity trigger levels previously 
notified are superseded by the levels 
indicated in the Annex to this notice. 
The definitions of these products were 
provided in the Notice of Safeguard 
Action published in the Federal 
Register, at 60 FR 427 (Jan. 4, 1995).

Certain Aluminum Foil From the 
Sultanate of Oman: Amended Final 
Results of Antidumping Duty 
Administrative Review; 2022–2023 
AGENCY: Enforcement and Compliance, International Trade Administration, 
Department of Commerce. 
SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) is amending the 
final results of the administrative review 
of the antidumping duty (AD) order on 
certain aluminum foil (aluminum foil) 
from the Sultanate of Oman (Oman) to 
correct certain ministerial errors. The 
period of review (POR) is November 1, 
2022, through October 31, 2023. 
DATES: Applicable December 22, 2025. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Alexander Cipolla, AD/CVD Operations, 
Office III, Enforcement and Compliance, 
International Trade Administration, 
U.S. Department of Commerce, 1401 
Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, 
DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482–4956. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On September 12, 2025, Commerce 
published the Final Results of the 
administrative review of the AD order 
on aluminum foil from Oman in the 
Federal Register.
1
On September 15, 
2025, we received a timely filed 
allegation of ministerial errors from 
Oman Aluminium Rolling Company 
SPC (OARC), the mandatory respondent 
in this administrative review.
2
On 
September 22, 2025, the Aluminum 
Association Trade Enforcement Working 
Group and its individual members 
(collectively, the petitioners) submitted 
timely comments in rebuttal to OARC’s 
Ministerial Error Comments.
3
We are 
amending the Final Results to correct 
certain ministerial errors raised by 
OARC.
4
 
Legal Framework 
Section 751(h) of the Tariff Act of 
1930, as amended (the Act), defines a 
‘‘ministerial error’’ as including ‘‘errors 
in addition, subtraction, or other 
arithmetic function, clerical errors 
resulting from inaccurate copying, 
duplication, or the like, and any other 
unintentional error which the 
administering authority considers 
ministerial.’’
5
With respect to final 
results of administrative reviews, 19 
CFR 351.224(e) provides that Commerce 
‘‘will analyze any comments received 
and, if appropriate, correct any . . . 
ministerial error by amending the final 
results of review. . .’’ 
Ministerial Errors 
In its ministerial error comments, 
OARC alleged that Commerce made 
ministerial errors in its: (1) final 
calculation of OARC’s dumping margin 
by over-applying certain international 
freight expenses; (2) by failing to 
account for the net quantities 
(NETQTYU) of OARC’s U.S. sales 
during the POR; (3) by failing to ensure 
that the treatment of OARC’s billing 
adjustments in the U.S. market was 
consistent with the gross unit prices; (4) 
by incorrectly assigning the importer 
field for the assessment calculation; (5) 
by applying the highest-value partial 
adverse facts available (AFA) 
adjustment to OARC’s reported U.S. 
duty (USDUTYU) field; and (6) by 
failing to cap any supposed freight 
revenues by the amount associated with 
freight expenses.
6
In its rebuttal 
comments, the petitioners argued that 
(1) OARC’s ministerial error allegation 
concerning net quantity was untimely 
alleged; (2) Commerce’s application of 
partial AFA to section 232 expenses was 
clearly identified and explained by 
Commerce, so it cannot be considered a 
ministerial error pursuant to section 
735(e) of the Act and 19 CFR 351.224(f); 
and (3) Commerce made a deliberate 
methodological choice to apply partial 
AFA to OARC’s freight expenses, and 
there is no indication to Commerce 
intended to calculate a freight revenue 
offset. 
We agree with OARC that we made 
two ministerial errors regarding its 
international freight expenses and 
billing adjustments in the Final Results, 
pursuant to section 751(h) of the Act 
and 19 CFR 351.224(f), and have 
amended our calculations to correct 
these errors.
7
Regarding OARC’s 
allegations concerning net quantity and 
the importer field, we find that OARC 
failed to identify the error during the 
time period specified by our regulations. 
Therefore, consistent with our 
regulations, we find that OARC’s 
submission, as it relates to NETQTYU 
and the importer field, constitutes an 
untimely ministerial error allegation. 
However, with regard to the importer 
field, we have exercised our discretion 
to correct the error identified, as 
correcting the error will allow for more 
accurate collection of duties. Finally, we 
disagree with OARC that we made 
ministerial errors in the Final Results 
concerning OARC’s freight revenue 
capping and section 232 expenses, and 
thus, have not amended our calculations 
with respect to these allegations. 
For a complete discussion of the 
ministerial error allegations, as well as 
Commerce’s analysis, see the accompanying Ministerial Error 
Memorandum.

As a result of correcting the 
ministerial errors described above, we 
determine the following estimated 
weighted-average dumping margin 
exists for the period November 3, 2022, 
through April 30, 2024:

Weighted- 
average

Disclosure 
We intend to disclose the calculations 
performed in connection with these 
amended final results of review to 
parties in this review within five days 
of the date of publication of this notice 
in the Federal Register, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.224(b). 
Assessment Rates 
Normally Commerce would issue 
assessment instructions to U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection (CBP) no earlier 
than 35 days after the date of 
publication of the amended final results 
of this review in the Federal Register. 
However, in this case, a timely 
summons and complaint have been filed 
at the U.S. Court of International Trade, 
and a statutory injunction is in place. 
Therefore, we will not issue assessment 
instructions until the injunction has 
lifted. When the injunction lifts such 
that we can issue assessment 
instructions, and where the respondent 
reported reliable entered values, we will 
calculate importer- (or customer-) 
specific ad valorem rates by aggregating the dumping margins calculated for all 
U.S. sales to each importer (or customer) 
and dividing this amount by the total 
entered value of the sales to each 
importer (or customer).
9
Where 
Commerce calculated a weighted- 
average dumping margin by dividing the 
total amount of dumping for reviewed 
sales to that party by the total sales 
quantity associated with those 
transactions, Commerce will direct CBP 
to assess importer- (or customer-) 
specific assessment rates based on the 
resulting per-unit rates.
10
Where an 
importer- (or customer-) specific ad 
valorem or per-unit rate is greater than 
de minimis (i.e., 0.50 percent), Commerce will instruct CBP to collect 
the appropriate duties at the time of 
liquidation.
11
Where an importer- (or 
customer-) specific ad valorem or per- 
unit rate is zero or de minimis, 
Commerce will instruct CBP to liquidate 
appropriate entries without regard to 
antidumping duties.
12
 
Consistent with Commerce’s 
assessment practice, for entries of 
subject merchandise during the POR 
produced by OARC for which the 
producer did not know that its 
merchandise was destined for the 
United States, we will instruct CBP to 
liquidate unreviewed entries at the all- 
others rate if there is no rate for the 
intermediate company(ies) involved in 
the transaction.
13
 
Cash Deposit Requirements 
The following amended cash deposit 
requirements will be effective for all 
shipments of the subject merchandise 
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, 
for consumption on or after September 
12, 2025, the publication date of the 
Final Results of this administrative 
review, as provided by section 
751(a)(2)(C) of the Act: (1) the amended 
cash deposit rate for the company listed 
above will be equal to the weighted- 
average dumping margin established in 
the amended final results of this 
administrative review; (2) for previously 
reviewed or investigated companies not 
participating in this review, the cash 
deposit rate will continue to be the 
company-specific rate published for the 
most recently completed segment of this 
proceeding in which the producer or 
exporter participated; (3) if the exporter 
is not a firm covered in this review, a 
prior review, or the original 
investigation but the producer is, the 
cash deposit rate will be the rate 
established for the most recently 
completed segment of this proceeding 
for the producer of the subject 
merchandise; and (4) the cash deposit 
rate for all other producers or exporters 
will continue to be the all-others rate 
established in the less-than-fair-value 
investigation (i.e., 3.89 percent).14
These 
cash deposit requirements, when 
imposed, shall remain in effect until 
further notice. 
Notification to Importers 
This notice serves as a final reminder 
to importers of their responsibility 
under 19 CFR 351.402(f)(2) to file a 
certificate regarding the reimbursement 
of antidumping and/or countervailing 
duties prior to liquidation of the 
relevant entries during this review 
period. Failure to comply with this 
requirement could result in Commerce’s 
presumption that reimbursement of 
antidumping duties and/or 
countervailing duties occurred and the 
subsequent assessment of double 
antidumping duties and/or an increase 
in the amount of antidumping duties by 
the amount of the countervailing duties. 
Administrative Protective Order 
This notice also serves as a reminder 
to parties subject to an administrative 
protective order (APO) of their 
responsibility concerning the 
destruction of proprietary information 
disclosed under APO in accordance 
with 19 CFR 351.305(a)(3). Timely 
written notification of the return or 
destruction of APO materials or 
conversion to judicial protective order is 
hereby requested. Failure to comply 
with the regulations and terms of an 
APO is a sanctionable violation. 
Notification to Interested Parties 
We are issuing and publishing these 
amended final results in accordance 
with sections 751(h) and 777(i) of the 
Act and 19 CFR 351.224(e).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Abstract 
This is a request for renewal of the 
existing reporting requirements of the 
approved collection of information, 
West Coast Region Family of Forms 
(0648–0204). 
The WCR Permits Office administers 
permits required for persons and vessels 
participating in Federally managed 
fisheries off the West Coast under the 
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management act, 16 
U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Section 303 (b) (1) 
of the Magnuson-Stevens Act 
specifically authorizes the 
establishment of permit requirements. 
Almost all international, federal, state, 
and local fishery management 
authorities use permits as part of their 
management systems. 
The Magnuson-Stevens Act 
established regional fishery 
management councils, including the 
Pacific Fishery Management Council 
(Pacific Council), to develop fishery 
management plans (FMP) for fisheries in 
the United States (U.S.) exclusive 
economic zone (EEZ). These plans, if 
approved by the Secretary of Commerce, 
are implemented by Federal regulations, 
which are enforced by the National 
Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and 
the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), in 
cooperation with State agencies to the 
extent possible. FMPs are intended to 
regulate fishing for stocks to prevent 
overfishing and achieve the optimum 
yield from the fisheries for the benefit 
of the U.S. The Pacific Council has 
prepared FMPs for the coastal pelagic 
species (CPS) fishery and Pacific Highly 
Migratory Species (HMS) off the U.S. 
West Coast. Each of these FMPs created 
permit programs which are 
administered by the West Coast Region, 
NMFS. 
There are two types of regulatory 
permits used by the WCR: Open access 
fishery permits and limited entry 
permits for selected fisheries. Open 
access permits are used in all fisheries 
where there are no specific limitations 
or eligibility criteria for entry to the 
fishery. Limited entry permits are used 
to prevent overcapitalization or address 
other management goals in the fishery 
and limit the number of applicants 
permitted to participate in the fishery. 
Applicants for both open access and 
limited entry permits are required to 
submit applications to obtain these 
permits but are not required to submit 
reports on their fishing activities under 
these permits. These permits are part of 
information collection request (ICR) 
0648–0204. 
Exempt fishing permits (EFPs) are 
issued to applicants for fishing activities 
that would otherwise be prohibited 
under a fisheries management plan. 
Applicants for an EFP must submit 
written information that allows NOAA 
and the Pacific Council to evaluate the 
proposed EFP activities and weigh the 
benefits and costs of the proposed 
activities. The Council makes a 
recommendation on each EFP 
application and for successful 
applicants, NOAA Fisheries issues the 
EFP which contains terms and 
conditions for the project including 
various reporting requirements. The 
information included in an application 
is specified at 50 CFR 600.745(b)(2) and 
the Pacific Council Operating Procedure 
#19. EFP holders are required to file 
preseason harvest plans, interim and/or 
final summary reports on the results of 
the project, and in some cases 
individual vessels and other permit 
holders are required to provide data 
reports (i.e., logbooks and/or catch reports). The results of EFPs are 
commonly used to explore ways to 
reduce effort on depressed stocks, 
encourage innovation and efficiency in 
the fishery, and provide access to 
constrained stocks by directly 
measuring the bycatch associated with 
current and proposed management 
measures. EFPs are currently part of ICR 
0648–0204. 
Letters of Authorization (LOAs) and 
Exempted Educational Activity 
Authorizations (EEAAs) are types of 
permits used to grant exemptions from 
fishery regulations for educational or 
other activities (e.g., using nonregulation gear). An EEAA is issued 
by the WCR to accredited educational 
institutions that authorize, for 
educational purposes, the target or 
incidental harvest of species managed 
under a fisheries management plan or 
fishery regulations that would otherwise 
be prohibited. EEAAs are generally of 
limited scope and duration and 
authorize the take of the amount of fish 
necessary to demonstrate the lesson. 
Researchers are requested to submit 
scientific research plans prior to 
undertaking those activities, along with 
reports of their scientific research 
activity after its completion. LOAs are 
required under Section 101(a)(5)(A) of 
the Marine Mammal Protection Act 
(MMPA) of 1972 for the incidental take 
of marine mammals during fisheries 
surveys and related research activities 
conducted by the Northwest Fisheries 
Science Center (NWFSC), NMFS. 
Management of certain marine 
mammals falls under the jurisdiction of 
the NMFS under the MMPA and 
Endangered Species Act (ESA) and 
mechanisms exist under both the 
MMPA and ESA to assess the effect of

6111, Silver Spring, MD 20910, (301) 
713–7389, lauren.bregman@noaa.gov. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
On November 21, 2025, the Secretary 
of Commerce (Secretary) received a 
‘‘Notice of Appeal’’ filed by Georgina 
Clemente pursuant to the Coastal Zone 
Management Act (CZMA), 16 U.S.C. 
1451 et seq., and implementing regulations found at 15 CFR part 930, 
subpart H. The ‘‘Notice of Appeal ’’ is 
taken from an objection by the New 
York State Department of State to a 
consistency certification for a pending 
permit application to the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers to install a dock and 
boat lift in Little Peconic Bay, Suffolk 
County, NY. 
Under the CZMA, the Secretary may 
override the New York State Department 
of State’s objection on grounds that the 
project is consistent with the objectives 
or purposes of the CZMA, or otherwise 
necessary in the interest of national 
security. To make the determination 
that the proposed activity is ‘‘consistent 
with the objectives or purposes of the 
CZMA,’’ the Secretary must find that: 
(1) the proposed activity furthers the 
national interest as articulated in 
sections 302 or 303 of the CZMA, in a 
significant or substantial manner; (2) the 
national interest furthered by the 
proposed activity outweighs the 
activity’s adverse coastal effects, when 
those effects are considered separately 
or cumulatively; and (3) no reasonable 
alternative is available that would 
permit the proposed activity to be 
conducted in a manner consistent with 
the enforceable policies of the 
applicable coastal management 
program. 15 CFR 930.121. To make the 
determination that the proposed activity 
is ‘‘necessary in the interest of national 
security,’’ the Secretary must find that a 
national defense or other national 
security interest would be significantly 
impaired if the proposed activity is not 
permitted to go forward as proposed. 15 
CFR 930.122. 
II. Request for Public and Federal 
Agency Comments 
We encourage the public and 
interested federal agencies to participate 
in this appeal by submitting written 
comments and any relevant materials 
supporting those comments using the 
method specified in the 
ADDRESSES 
section of this notice. All comments 
received are a part of the public record 
and will generally be posted for public 
viewing on www.regulations.gov 
without change. All personally 
identifiable information (e.g., name, address), confidential business 
information, or otherwise sensitive 
information submitted voluntarily by 
the sender will be publicly accessible. 
NOAA will accept anonymous 
comments (enter ‘‘N/A’’ in the required 
fields if you wish to remain 
anonymous).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Abstract 
This request is for a revision and 
extension of an existing information 
collection. The Polar-Orbiting 
Operational Environmental Satellite 
(POES) data collection system (DCS), 
also known as the Argos system, is 
being removed from this collection as it 
is no longer administered by the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA). 
NOAA operates the Geostationary 
Operational Environmental Satellite 
(GOES) space-based data collection 
system (DCS) per 15 CFR part 911. The 
GOES DCS is operated to support 
environmental applications, e.g., 
meteorology, oceanography, hydrology, 
ecology, and remote sensing of Earth 
resources. Presently, the majority of 
users of these systems are government 
agencies and researchers, and much of 
the data collected by the GOES DCS is 
provided to the World Meteorological 
Organization via the Global 
Telecommunication System for 
inclusion in the World Weather Watch 
Program. 
Current loading on the GOES system 
does not use the entire capacity of that 
system, so NOAA is able to make its 
excess capacity available to other users 
who meet certain criteria. Applications 
are made in response to the 
requirements in 15 CFR 911 (under the 
authority of 15 U.S.C. 313, Duties of the 
Secretary of Commerce and others), 
using system use agreement (SUA) form. 
The application information received is 
used to determine if the applicant meets 
the criteria for use of the system. The 
system use agreements contain the 
following information: (1) the period of 
time the agreement is valid and 
procedures for its termination, (2) the 
authorized use(s) of the DCS, and its 
priorities for use, (3) the extent of the 
availability of commercial services 
which met the user’s requirements and 
the reasons for choosing the government 
system, (4) any applicable government 
interest in the data, (5) required 
equipment standards, (6) standards of 
operation, (7) conformance with 
applicable International 
Telecommunication Union (ITU) and 
Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC) agreements and regulations, (8) 
reporting time and frequencies, (9) data 
formats, (10) data delivery systems and 
schedules and (11) user-borne costs. 
Accepted applicants use the NOAA 
DCS to collect environmental data to 
support other governmental and non- 
governmental research or operational 
requirements, such as for law 
enforcement purposes. The applicants 
must submit information to ensure that 
they meet these criteria. NOAA does not 
approve agreements where there is a 
commercial service available to fulfill 
the user requirements (per 15 CFR part 
911). 
II. Method of Collection 
Method of submittal is electronically 
(via internet). 
III. Data 
OMB Control Number: 0648–0157. 
Form Number: None. 
Type of Review: Regular submission 
(extension of a current information 
collection). 
Affected Public: Not-for-profit 
institutions; Federal government; state, 
local, or tribal government; business or 
other for-profit organizations. 
Estimated Number of Respondents: 
75. 
Estimated Time per Response: Thirty 
minutes per response. 
Estimated Total Annual Burden 
Hours: 38. Estimated Total Annual Cost to

Evaluate whether the proposed 
information collection is necessary for 
the proper functions of the Department, 
including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) Evaluate the

Needs and Uses: The National Marine 
Fisheries Service (NMFS), Alaska 
Regional Office, is requesting renewal of 
the currently approved information 
collection for the Economic Data 
Reporting for the Bering Sea and 
Aleutian Island Crab Rationalization 
Program (CR Program). The CR Program 
is a limited access privilege program 
managed under the authority of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act 
(Magnuson-Stevens Act), the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 
2004 (Pub. L. 108–199, Sec. 801), and 
the Fishery Management Plan for Bering 
Sea/Aleutian Islands King and Tanner 
Crab (FMP). The CR Program allocates 
crab among harvesters, processors, 
Western Alaska Community 
Development Quota groups, and coastal 
communities for nine crab fisheries. The 
CR Program also includes a 
comprehensive economic data 
collection program requiring 
participants to complete annual 
Economic Data Reports (EDRs). These 
EDRs are intended to aid the North 
Pacific Fishery Management Council 
(Council) and NOAA’s National Marine 
Fisheries Service (NMFS) to assess the 
performance of the CR Program and to 
develop amendments to the FMP or 
regulations to mitigate any unintended 
consequences of the CR Program. 
NMFS has designated Pacific States 
Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC) 
as the Data Collection Agent for the CR 
Program. NMFS and PSMFC administer 
the crab EDR program under the 
guidance of the Council. The crab EDR 
program collects annually reported cost, 
revenue, ownership, and employment 
data from harvest and processing sector 
participants in the CR Program fisheries. 
This information is necessary to monitor 
and assess the economic effects of the 
CR Program and support rigorous 
economic analysis to promote the goals 
and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act and the FMP. 
Participation in the crab EDR program 
is mandatory under Federal fisheries 
regulations at 50 CFR 680.6 for all active 
vessel and processing sector 
participants in the CR Program fisheries. 
This information collection contains 
the three EDRs used by participants in 
the CR Program: Catcher Vessel Crab 
EDR, Catcher/Processor Crab EDR, and 
Processor Crab EDR. An EDR is required 
from any owner or leaseholder of a 
vessel or processing plant, or a holder 
of a registered crab receiver permit that 
harvested, processed, custom processed, 
or obtained custom processing for CR 
Program crab in specified Bering Sea 
and Aleutian Islands crab fisheries 
during the prior calendar year. The 
EDRs are submitted annually and are 
due on or before July 31 of the following 
year. Additional information on the crab 
EDR program is available on the PSFMC 
website at http://www.psmfc.org/ 
alaska_crab/. Affected Public: Business or other for- 
profit organizations, Not-for-profit 
organizations. 
Frequency: Annually. Respondent’s Obligation: Mandatory. 
Legal Authority: Participation in the 
crab EDR program is mandatory under 
Federal fisheries regulations at 50 CFR 
680.6 for all active vessel and 
processing sector participants in the CR 
Program fisheries. 
This information collection request 
may be viewed at www.reginfo.gov.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Abstract 
Public Law 113–227 (Dec. 16, 2014) 
requires the United States Patent and 
Trademark Office to establish 
regulations and procedures for 
application to, and participation in, the 
USPTO Law School Clinic Certification 
Program. The Program allows students 
enrolled in a participating law school’s 
clinic to practice patent or trademark 
law before the USPTO under the direct 
supervision of an approved faculty 
clinic supervisor. Each clinic provides 
legal services on a pro bono basis for 
clients who qualify for assistance from 
the law school’s clinic. By drafting, 
filing, and prosecuting patent and 
trademark applications, students gain 
valuable experience that would 
otherwise be unavailable to them while 
in law school. The program also 
facilitates the provision of pro bono 
services to patent and trademark 
applicants who lack the financial 
resources necessary for traditional legal 
representation. Currently, 74 law 
schools participate in the program. 
This information collection covers the 
applications from law schools that wish 
to enter the program, faculty advisors 
who seek to become a faculty clinic 
supervisor, and students who seek to 
participate in this program. The 
collection also includes the required 
semi-annual reports from participating 
law school clinics and biennial 
renewals required by the program. With 
this renewal, the USPTO is renumbering 
the items within this information 
collection to match their current 
arrangement. 
II. Method of Collection 
Items in this information collection 
may be submitted as electronic 
submissions. Applicants may also 
submit the information in paper form by 
mail, fax, or hand delivery.

The USPTO expects that university faculty members will complete these items in this information collection at an estimated rate of $67.28 per hour. The faculty 
rate is found in the May 2024 Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics tables (25–1112 Law Teachers, Postsecondary). While no exact number is listed as a 
mean hourly wage, USPTO reached the estimated rate by taking the mean annual wage ($139,950) and dividing it by 2,080, which is the number of annual work 
hours based on a 40-hour work week; https://data.bls.gov/oesprofile/.

The wage rate for Item 2 is taken from the same source in Table 1. The cost for law students applying to participate in the program (Item 3) is estimated to be at 
the 50% hourly rate for legal occupations (BLS 23–0000 Legal Occupations) which is $33.10 per hour, as found in the May 2024 Occupational Employment and 
Wage Statistics tables; https://data.bls.gov/oesprofile/. This accounts for law students’ possible employment in various entry level legal positions. Estimated Total Annual Respondent 
Non-hourly Cost Burden: $61. There are 
no maintenance costs, capital start-up 
costs, recordkeeping costs, or filing fees 
associated with this information 
collection. However, the USPTO 
estimates that the total annual non-hour 
cost burden for this information 
collection, in the form of postage, is $61. 
Postage 
Submissions under the Law School 
Clinic are accepted via email, postal 
mail, and hand delivery. The USPTO 
expects that only five (5) submissions 
will be submitted through the U.S. 
Postal Service. The remaining items will 
be submitted electronically. The average 
postage cost for a mailed submission, 
using a Priority Mail flat rate legal 
envelope is $12.10. Therefore, the 
USPTO estimates that the total postage 
costs for the mailed submissions in this 
information collection will total $61. 
IV. Request for Comments 
The USPTO is soliciting public 
comments to: 
(a) Evaluate whether the collection of 
information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the 
Agency, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; 
(b) Evaluate the accuracy of the 
Agency’s estimate of the burden of the 
collection of information, including the 
validity of the methodology and 
assumptions used; 
(c) Enhance the quality, utility, and 
clarity of the information to be 
collected; and 
(d) Minimize the burden of the 
collection of information on those who 
are to respond, including through the 
use of appropriate automated, 
electronic, mechanical, or other 
technological collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology, 
e.g., permitting electronic submission of responses. 
All comments submitted in response 
to this notice are a matter of public 
record. The USPTO will include or 
summarize each comment in the request 
to OMB to approve this information 
collection. Before including an address, 
phone number, email address, or other 
personally identifiable information (PII) 
in a comment, be advised that the entire 
comment—including PII—may be made 
publicly available at any time. While 
one may request in a comment to 
withhold PII from public view, the 
USPTO cannot guarantee that it will be 
able to do so.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with the Privacy Act of 
1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, the CFPB is 
modifying a system of records titled, 
‘‘CFPB.008 Transit Subsidy Program.’’

Abstract: Section 215 of the FPA provides that the Commission may 
certify an Electric Reliability 
Organization (ERO), the purpose of 
which is to develop mandatory and 
enforceable Reliability Standards, 
subject to Commission review and 
approval.
1
Reliability Standards may be 
enforced by the ERO, subject to 
Commission oversight, or by the 
Commission independently.
2
Pursuant 
to section 215 of the FPA, the 
Commission established a process to 
select and certify an ERO,
3
and 
subsequently certified NERC.

On October 1, 2025, in Docket No. 
RD25–10, the Commission approved 
NERC’s filing of a petition seeking 
approval of two revised NERC 
definitions, generator owner and 
generator operator as ‘‘to align the 
definitions of the Generator Owner and 
Generator Operator terms in the NERC 
Glossary with the recently revised 
Generator Owner and Generator 
Operator registration functions in the 
NERC Rules of Procedure Statement of 
Compliance Registry Criteria,’’
5
 
approved by the Commission in Docket 
No. RR24–2–000 on June 27, 2024.
6
The 
terms generator owner and generator 
operator now include non-bulk electric 
system (BES) inverter-based resources 
(IBR) that either have or contribute to an 
aggregate nameplate capacity of greater 
than or equal to 20 MVA, connected 
through a system designed primarily for 
delivering such capacity to a common 
point of connection at a voltage greater 
than or equal to 60 kV (category 2). 
Consequently, the new definitions in 
the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC 
Reliability Standards (NERC Glossary) 
will impose paperwork burdens on 
category 2 generator owners and 
generator operators that will now need 
to comply with applicable Reliability 
Standards. 
The approved revision to the 
definition of generator owner in the 
NERC Glossary is:
7
 
The entity that: (1) owns and maintains 
generating Facility(ies) (Category 1 GO); or 
(2) owns and maintains non-BES Inverter- 
Based Resource(s) that either have or 
contribute to an aggregate nameplate capacity 
of greater than or equal to 20 MVA, 
connected through a system designed 
primarily for delivering such capacity to a 
common point of connection at a voltage 
greater than or equal to 60 kV (Category 2 
GO). 
The approved revision to the 
definition of generator operator in the 
NERC Glossary is:
8
 
The entity that: (1) operates generating 
Facility(ies) and performs the functions of 
supplying energy and Interconnected 
Operations Services (Category 1 GOP); or (2) 
operates non-BES Inverter-Based Resource(s) 
that either have or contribute to an aggregate 
nameplate capacity of greater than or equal 
to 20 MVA, connected through a system 
designed primarily for delivering such 
capacity to a common point of connection at 
a voltage greater than or equal to 60 kV 
(Category 2 GOP). 
As a result of the inclusion of category 
2 resources in the NERC Glossary, 
applicable responsible entities will have 
to comply with reporting requirements 
for this information collection for each 
of the eight reliability standards 
included in NERC’s implementation 
plan associated with Docket No. RD25– 
10. The eight applicable Reliability 
Standards are: BAL–001–TRE–2; IRO– 
010–5; MOD–032–1; PRC–012–2; PRC– 
017–1; TOP–003–6.1; VAR–001–5; and 
VAR–002–4.1. 
Reliability Standard BAL–001–TRE–2 
is currently located in the FERC–725T 
(OMB Control No. 1902–0273) 
collection. The purpose of Reliability 
Standard BAL–001–TRE–2 is to 
maintain interconnection steady-state 
frequency within defined limits. The 
category 2 generator owners and 
generator operators will now have to 
follow Requirements R6 through R10. 
Requirements R6, R7, R9, and R10 
require the generator owner to set their 
governor parameters to be responsive to 
frequency obligations and provide 
notification to other entities when their 
governor is unavailable. Requirement R8 
requires generator operators notify their 
balancing authority of service status 
changes. 
Reliability Standard IRO–010–5 is 
currently located in the FERC–725Z 
(OMB Control No. 1902–0276) 
collection. The purpose of the standard 
is to prevent instability, uncontrolled 
separation, or cascading outages that

‘‘Burden’’ is defined as the total time, effort, or 
financial resources expended by persons to 
generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or provide 
information to or for a Federal agency. For further 
explanation of what is included in the information 
collection burden, see 5 CFR 1320.3. 
adversely impact reliability by ensuring 
each reliability coordinator has the data 
and information it needs to plan, 
monitor and assess the operation of its 
reliability coordinator area. The 
category 2 generator owners and 
operators will now have to meet 
Requirement R3 that requires the 
generator owners and generator 
operators to satisfy the obligations of the 
documented specifications from the 
reliability coordinator on data and 
information needed for the operational 
planning analyses, real-time monitoring, 
and real-time assessments. Reliability 
Standard MOD–032–1 is currently 
located in the FERC–725L (OMB Control 
No. 1902–0261) collection. The purpose 
of the standard is to establish consistent 
modeling data requirements and 
reporting procedures for development of 
planning horizon cases necessary to 
support analysis of the reliability of the 
interconnected transmission system. 
The category 2 generator owners will 
now have to follow Requirements R2 
and R3 that require generator owners 
provide modeling data to and address 
any concerns raised by the planning 
coordinator or transmission planner. 
Reliability Standards PRC–012–2 and 
PRC–017–1 are currently located in the 
FERC–725G (OMB Control No. 1902– 
0252) collection. The purpose of PRC– 
012–2 is to ensure that remedial action 
schemes (RAS) do not introduce 
unintentional or unacceptable reliability 
risks to the BES. The stated purpose of 
Reliability Standard PRC–017–1 is to 
ensure that all RAS are properly 
designed, meet performance 
requirements, and are coordinated with 
other protection systems and to ensure 
that maintenance and testing programs 
are developed and misoperations are 
analyzed and corrected. The category 2 
generator owners, that are part of a RAS, 
will now have to follow Requirements 
R1, R3, and R5 through R8 in Reliability 
Standard PRC–012–2 and Requirements 
R1 and R2 in Reliability Standard PRC– 
017–1. Specifically, Reliability Standard 
PRC–012–2 requires that generator 
owners that own all or part of a RAS to 
review and provide information to their 
reliability coordinator in R1 and R3; and 
to test, analyze performance, and take 
corrective action, if needed, in 
Requirements R5 through R8. 
Requirements R1 and R2 of Reliability 
Standard PRC–017–1 require generator 
owners that own a RAS to maintain and 
document a system maintenance and 
testing program. 
Reliability Standard TOP–003–6.1 is 
currently located in the FERC–725A 
(OMB Control No. 1902–0244) 
collection. The purpose of this standard 
is to ensure that each transmission 
operator and balancing authority has the 
data and information it needs to plan, 
monitor, and assess the operation of its 
transmission operator area or balancing 
authority area. The category 2 generator 
owners and generator operators will 
now have to follow Requirement R5, 
which requires generator owners and 
generator operators to satisfy the 
obligations of the documented 
specifications of data and information 
related to operational planning analyses, 
real-time monitoring, and real-time 
assessments provided by the 
transmission operator or balancing 
authority. 
Reliability Standards VAR–001–5 and 
VAR–002–4.1 are currently located in 
the FERC–725X (OMB Control No. 
1902–0278) collection. The purpose of 
Reliability Standard VAR–001–5 is to 
ensure that voltage levels, reactive 
flows, and reactive resources are 
monitored, controlled, and maintained 
within limits in real-time to protect 
equipment and the reliable operation of 
the interconnection. The purpose of 
Reliability Standard VAR–002–4.1 is to 
ensure generators provide reactive 
support and voltage control, within 
generating facility capabilities, in order 
to protect equipment and maintain 
reliable operation of the 
interconnection. The category 2 
generator owners in Western Electricity 
Coordinating Council (WECC) will now 
have to follow Requirements E.A.15 and 
E.A.17 in Reliability Standard VAR– 
001–5. The category 2 generator 
operators will now have to follow 
Reliability Standard VAR–002–4.1, 
Requirements R1 through 4 and the 
category 2 generator owners will now 
have to follow Requirements R5 and R6. 
Specifically, Requirements E.A.15 and 
E.A. 17 require generator operators in 
WECC to provide voltage set point 
conversion methodologies to its 
transmission operator and to meet 
control loop specifications. 
Requirements R1 through 4 of 
Reliability Standard VAR–002–4.1 
require the generator operators to 
operate their generators in automatic 
voltage control mode, maintain voltage 
schedules, and to notify their 
transmission operator in the event of a 
change. Requirements R5 and R6 require 
the generator owner to provide data and 
tap settings information to their 
transmission operator and transmission 
planner and to ensure transformer tap 
positions are changed according to the 
specifications provided by the 
transmission operator. 
Type of Respondents: Generator 
owners and generator operator entities 
registered with NERC that own or 
operate category 2 resources. 
Estimate of Annual Burden:
9
The 
applicable requirements from the eight 
applicable Reliability Standards largely 
consist of sharing and communicating 
readily available data and information 
for category 2 resources. Thus, 
Commission staff anticipates that the 
paperwork burden should be minimal 
for category 2 resources. The number of 
respondents, in the tables below, are 
based on good faith estimates provided 
by NERC, in August 2025, to 
Commission staff for the number of 
entities that either own or operate 
category 2 resources. 
The Commission estimates the annual 
reporting burden and cost for the 
information collection as:

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY 
Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission 
[Docket No. CP26–24–000] 
Texas Eastern Transmission, L.P.; 
Notice of Scoping Period Requesting 
Comments on Environmental Issues 
for the Proposed Kosciusko 
Compressor Station Replacement 
Project 
The staff of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission (FERC or 
Commission) will prepare an 
environmental document that will 
discuss the environmental effects of the 
Kosciusko Compressor Station 
Replacement Project involving 
construction and operation of facilities 
by Texas Eastern Transmission, LP 
(Texas Eastern) in Attala County, 
Mississippi. The Commission will use 
this environmental document in its 
decision-making process to determine 
whether the project is in the public 
convenience and necessity. 
This notice announces the opening of 
the scoping process the Commission 
will use to gather input from the public 
and interested agencies regarding the 
project. As part of the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) 
review process, the Commission takes 
into account concerns the public may 
have about proposals and the 
environmental effects that could result 
from its action whenever it considers 
the issuance of a Certificate of Public 
Convenience and Necessity. This 
gathering of public input is referred to 
as ‘‘scoping.’’ The main goal of the 
scoping process is to focus the analysis 
in the environmental document on the 
important environmental issues. 
Additional information about the 
Commission’s NEPA process is 
described below in the NEPA Process 
and Environmental Document section of 
this notice. 
By this notice, the Commission 
requests public comments on the scope 
of issues to address in the 
environmental document. To ensure 
that your comments are timely and 
properly recorded, please submit your 
comments so that the Commission 
receives them in Washington, DC on or 
before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 
January 15, 2026. Comments may be 
submitted in written form. Further 
details on how to submit comments are 
provided in the Public Participation 
section of this notice. 
Your comments should focus on the 
potential environmental effects, 
reasonable alternatives, and measures to 
avoid or lessen environmental effects. 
Your input will help the Commission 
staff determine what issues they need to 
evaluate in the environmental 
document. Commission staff will 
consider all written comments during 
the preparation of the environmental 
document. 
If you submitted comments on this 
project to the Commission before the 
opening of this docket on November 13, 
2025, you will need to file those 
comments in Docket No. CP26–24–000 
to ensure they are considered as part of 
this proceeding. 
This notice is being sent to the 
Commission’s current environmental 
mailing list for this project. State and 
local government representatives should 
notify their constituents of this 
proposed project and encourage them to 
comment on their areas of concern. 
If you are a landowner receiving this 
notice, a pipeline company 
representative may contact you about 
the acquisition of an easement to 
construct, operate, and maintain the 
proposed facilities. The company would 
seek to negotiate a mutually acceptable 
easement agreement. You are not 
required to enter into an agreement. 
However, if the Commission approves 
the project, the Natural Gas Act conveys 
the right of eminent domain to the 
company. Therefore, if you and the 
company do not reach an easement 
agreement, the pipeline company could 
initiate condemnation proceedings in 
court. In such instances, compensation 
would be determined by a judge in 
accordance with state law. The 
Commission does not subsequently 
grant, exercise, or oversee the exercise 
of that eminent domain authority. The 
courts have exclusive authority to 
handle eminent domain cases; the 
Commission has no jurisdiction over 
these matters. 
Texas Eastern provided landowners 
with a fact sheet prepared by the FERC 
entitled ‘‘An Interstate Natural Gas 
Facility On My Land? What Do I Need 
To Know?’’ which addresses typically 
asked questions, including the use of 
eminent domain and how to participate 
in the Commission’s proceedings. This 
fact sheet along with other landowner 
topics of interest are available for 
viewing on the FERC website 
(www.ferc.gov) under the Natural Gas, 
Landowner Topics link.

Summary of the Proposed Project 
Texas Eastern proposes to abandon by 
removal 14 reciprocating compressor 
units and install three new natural gas 
turbine units at the Kosciusko 
Compressor Station in Attala County, 
Mississippi. According to Texas Eastern, 
its project would ensure the continued 
safe and reliable operation of the station 
while meeting current air emissions 
requirements and minimizing 
disruption to customers. 
The Kosciusko Compressor Station 
Replacement Project would consist of 
the following activities: 
€abandonment by removal of thefollowing facilities: 
Æfive 2,500-horsepower Cooper Bessemer GMW series reciprocating 
units; 
Ænine 2,500-horsepower Cooper Bessemer GMWA series reciprocating 
units; 
Æassociated buildings and enclosures that currently house the reciprocating 
units; and 
Æother associated appurtenant facilities. 
€abandonment in place of all below- grade facilities, or associated facilities, 
such as piping, piping supports, 
foundations, conduits, and cables; and 
€installation of the followingfacilities: 
Æone 20,500-horsepower Solar Titan 130 natural gas-fired turbine unit and 
two 11,110-horsepower Solar Taurus 70 
natural gas-fired turbine units; 
Æenclosures to house the new units, one electrical control building, and one 
low voltage switchgear building; and 
Æother appurtenant facilities. The general location of the project 
facilities is shown in appendix 1.
1
 
Land Requirements for Construction 
Construction of the proposed facilities 
would disturb about 40.6 acres of land, 
including 36.6 acres within the existing 
compressor station fenceline and 4.0 
acres of temporary workspace. 
Following construction, the temporary 
workspace would be restored and revert 
to former uses. Operation of the project 
would not require new land outside of 
the existing compressor station 
fenceline. 
NEPA Process and the Environmental 
Document 
Any environmental document issued 
by the Commission will discuss effects 
that could occur as a result of the 
construction and operation of the 
proposed project under the relevant 
general resource areas: 
€geology and soils;€water resources and wetlands;€vegetation and wildlife;€threatened and endangered species;€cultural resources;€socioeconomics;€land use;€air quality and noise; and€reliability and safety.Commission staff will also evaluate
reasonable alternatives to the proposed 
project or portions of the project and 
make recommendations on how to 
lessen or avoid effects on the various 
resource areas. Your comments will 
help Commission staff identify and 
focus on the issues that might have an 
effect on the human environment and 
potentially eliminate others from further 
study and discussion in the 
environmental document. 
Following this scoping period, 
Commission staff will determine 
whether to prepare an Environmental 
Assessment (EA) or an Environmental 
Impact Statement (EIS). The EA or the 
EIS will present Commission staff’s 
independent analysis of the issues. If 
Commission staff prepares an EA, a 
Notice of Schedule for the Preparation 
of an Environmental Assessment will be 
issued. The EA may be issued for an 
allotted public comment period. The 
Commission would consider timely 
comments on the EA before making its 
decision regarding the proposed project. 
If Commission staff prepares an EIS, a 
Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS/ 
Notice of Schedule will be issued, 
which will open up an additional 
comment period. Staff will then prepare 
a draft EIS which will be issued for 
public comment. Commission staff will 
consider all timely comments received 
during the comment period on the draft 
EIS and revise the document, as 
necessary, before issuing a final EIS. 
Any EA or draft and final EIS will be 
available in electronic format in the 
public record through eLibrary
2
and the 
Commission’s natural gas 
environmental documents web page 
(https://www.ferc.gov/industries-data/ 
natural-gas/environment/ 
environmental-documents). If 
eSubscribed, you will receive instant 
email notification when the 
environmental document is issued. 
With this notice, the Commission is 
asking agencies with jurisdiction by law 
and/or special expertise with respect to 
the environmental issues of this project 
to formally cooperate in the preparation 
of the environmental document.
3
 
Agencies that would like to request 
cooperating agency status should follow 
the instructions for filing comments 
provided under the Public Participation 
section of this notice.

motions to intervene, and comments is 
explained below. 
For public inquiries and assistance 
with making filings such as 
interventions, comments, or requests for 
rehearing, contact the Office of Public 
Participation (OPP) at (202) 502–6595 or 
OPP@ferc.gov. 
Comments 
Any person wishing to comment on 
the project may do so. Comments may 
include statements of support or 
objections, to the project as a whole or 
specific aspects of the project. The more 
specific your comments, the more useful 
they will be. 
Protests 
Pursuant to sections 157.10(a)(4)
2
and 
385.211
3
of the Commission’s 
regulations under the NGA, any person
4
 
may file a protest to the application. 
Protests must comply with the 
requirements specified in section 
385.2001
5
of the Commission’s 
regulations. A protest may also serve as 
a motion to intervene so long as the 
protestor states it also seeks to be an 
intervenor. 
To ensure that your comments or 
protests are timely and properly 
recorded, please submit your comments 
on or before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 
January 6, 2026. 
There are three methods you can use 
to submit your comments or protests to 
the Commission. In all instances, please 
reference the Project docket number 
CP26–36–000 in your submission. 
(1) You may file your comments 
electronically by using the eComment 
feature, which is located on the 
Commission’s website at www.ferc.gov 
under the link to Documents and 
Filings. Using eComment is an easy 
method for interested persons to submit 
brief, text-only comments on a project; 
(2) You may file your comments or 
protests electronically by using the 
eFiling feature, which is located on the

comments in a variety of formats by 
attaching them as a file with your 
submission. New eFiling users must 
first create an account by clicking on 
‘‘eRegister.’’ You will be asked to select 
the type of filing you are making; first 
select ‘‘General’’ and then select 
‘‘Comment on a Filing’’; or 
(3) You can file a paper copy of your 
comments or protests by mailing them 
to the following address below. Your

All timely, unopposed
9
motions to 
intervene are automatically granted by 
operation of Rule 214(c)(1).
10
Motions to 
intervene that are filed after the 
intervention deadline are untimely, and 
may be denied. Any late-filed motion to 
intervene must show good cause for 
being late and must explain why the 
time limitation should be waived and 
provide justification by reference to 
factors set forth in Rule 214(d) of the 
Commission’s Rules and Regulations.
11
 
A person obtaining party status will be 
placed on the service list maintained by 
the Secretary of the Commission and

Commission 
[Project No. 8615–000] 
Fiske Hydro Inc.; Notice of 
Authorization for Continued Project 
Operation 
The license for the Fiske 
Hydroelectric Project No. 8615 was 
issued for a period ending November 30, 
2025. 
Section 15(a)(1) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. 
808(a)(1), requires the Commission, at 
the expiration of a license term, to issue 
from year-to-year an annual license to 
the then licensee(s) under the terms and 
conditions of the prior license until a 
new license is issued, or the project is 
otherwise disposed of as provided in 
section 15 or any other applicable 
section of the FPA. If the project’s prior 
license waived the applicability of 
section 15 of the FPA, then, based on 
section 9(b) of the Administrative 
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 558(c), and as 
set forth at 18 CFR 16.21(a), if the 
licensee of such project has filed an 
application for a subsequent license, the 
licensee may continue to operate the 
project in accordance with the terms 
and conditions of the license after the 
minor or minor part license expires, 
until the Commission acts on its 
application. If the licensee of such a 
project has not filed an application for 
a subsequent license, then it may be 
required, pursuant to 18 CFR 16.21(b), 
to continue project operations until the 
Commission issues someone else a 
license for the project or otherwise 
orders disposition of the project. 
If the project is subject to section 15 
of the FPA, notice is hereby given that 
an annual license for Project No. 8615 
is issued to Fiske Hydro Inc. for a period 
effective December 1, 2025, through 
November 30, 2026, or until the 
issuance of a new license for the project 
or other disposition under the FPA, 
whichever comes first. 
If issuance of a new license (or other 
disposition) does not take place on or 
before November 30, 2026, notice is 
hereby given that, pursuant to 18 CFR 
16.18(c), an annual license under 
section 15(a)(1) of the FPA is renewed 
automatically without further order or 
notice by the Commission, unless the 
Commission orders otherwise. 
If the project is not subject to section 
15 of the FPA, notice is hereby given 
that Fiske Hydro Inc. is authorized to 
continue operation of the Fiske 
Hydroelectric Project under the terms 
and conditions of the prior license until 
the issuance of a subsequent license for 
the project or other disposition under 
the FPA, whichever comes first.

[OMB 3060–0791; FR ID 322753] 
Information Collection Being Reviewed 
by the Federal Communications 
Commission Under Delegated 
Authority 
AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. 
ACTION: Notice and request for comments. 
SUMMARY: As part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork burdens, and as 
required by the Paperwork Reduction 
Act (PRA) of 1995, the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC or 
the Commission) invites the general 
public and other Federal agencies to 
take this opportunity to comment on the 
following information collection. 
Comments are requested concerning: 
whether the proposed collection of 
information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the 
Commission, including whether the 
information shall have practical utility; 
the accuracy of the Commission’s 
burden estimate; ways to enhance the 
quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information collected; ways to minimize 
the burden of the collection of 
information on the respondents, 
including the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of 
information technology; and ways to 
further reduce the information 
collection burden on small business 
concerns with fewer than 25 employees. 
The FCC may not conduct or sponsor a 
collection of information unless it 
displays a currently valid control 
number. No person shall be subject to 
any penalty for failing to comply with 
a collection of information subject to the 
PRA that does not display a valid Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) 
control number. 
DATES: Written PRA comments should be submitted on or before February 20, 
2026. If you anticipate that you will be 
submitting comments, but find it 
difficult to do so within the period of 
time allowed by this notice, you should 
advise the contact listed below as soon 
as possible. 
ADDRESSES: Direct all PRA comments to Nicole Ongele, FCC, via email PRA@
fcc.gov and to nicole.ongele@fcc.gov. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For additional information about the 
information collection, contact Nicole 
Ongele, (202) 418–2991.

Type of Review: Extension of a 
currently approved collection. 
Respondents: Business or other for- profit. 
Number of Respondents and 
Responses: 2 respondents; 2 responses. Estimated Time per Response: 4–36 
hours. 
Frequency of Response: On occasion 
reporting requirement and 
recordkeeping requirement. 
Obligation to Respond: Required to 
obtain or retain benefits. Statutory 
authority for this collection of 
information is contained in 47 U.S.C. 
151, 152, 154, 161, 201–205 and 218– 
220 of the Communications Act of 1934, 
as amended. 
Total Annual Burden: 40 hours. 
Total Annual Cost: No cost. 
Needs and Uses: The Commission is 
seeking Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) approval for an extension 
of this information collection (no 
change in the reporting and/or 
recordkeeping requirements). The 
Commission will submit this 
information collection after this 60-day 
comment period to the OMB. The 
Commission adopted accounting rules 
that require carriers to account for 
adverse federal antitrust judgments and 
post-judgment special charges. With 
regard to settlements of such lawsuits, 
there will be a presumption that carriers 
can recover the portion of the settlement 
that represents the avoidable costs of 
litigation; provided that the carrier 
makes a required showing. To receive 
recognition of its avoided cost of 
litigation a carrier must demonstrate, in 
a request for special relief, the avoided 
costs of litigation by showing the 
amount corresponding to the additional 
litigation expenses discounted to 
present value, that the carrier 
reasonably estimates it would have paid 
if it had not settled. Settlement costs in 
excess of the avoided costs of litigation 
are presumed not recoverable unless a 
carrier rebuts that presumption by 
showing the basic factors that enticed 
the carrier to settle and demonstrating 
that ratepayers benefited from the 
settlement.

Total Annual Burden: 44,700 hours. 
Total Annual Cost: $832,000. 
Needs and Uses: The Commission 
established a plan to ensure that 
payphone service providers (PSPs) were 
compensated for certain non-coin calls 
originated from their payphones. As 
part of this plan, the Commission 
required that by October 7, 1997, local 
exchange carriers were to provide 
payphone-specific coding digits to PSPs, 
and that PSPs were to provide those 
digits from their payphones to 
interexchange carriers. The provision of 
payphone-specific coding digits was a 
prerequisite to payphone per-call 
compensation payments by IXCs to 
PSPs for subscriber 800 and access code 
calls. The Commission’s Wireline 
Competition Bureau subsequently 
provided a waiver until March 9, 1998, 
for those payphones for which the 
necessary coding digits were not 
provided to identify calls. The Bureau 
also on that date clarified the 
requirements established in the 
Payphone Orders for the provision of 
payphone-specific coding digits and for 
tariffs that LECs must file pursuant to 
the Payphone Orders.

Needs and Uses: The Commission is 
requesting Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) approval for a revision to 
a currently approved information 
collection. In Accelerating Wireline 
Broadband Deployment by Removing 
Barriers to Infrastructure Investment, 
WC Docket No. 17–84, Fifth Report and 
Order, FCC 25–38 (rel. July 25, 2025) 
(Order), the Commission adopted rules 
that implement the pole attachment 
requirements in section 224 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended. The Order substantially 
revised 47 CFR 1.1411 and 47 CFR 
1.1412. 
Section 1.1411. In the Order, the 
Commission adopted regulations 
requiring (1) greater collaboration and 
cooperation between utilities and 
attachers, (2) a timeline for large pole 
attachment requests, (3) improvements 
to the pole attachment timeline, and (4) 
improvements to the contractor 
approval process. The Commission 
adopted these requirements to help 
improve the attachment process and 
potentially reduce disputes, thus 
facilitating broadband deployment. 
Specifically, the Order requires (1) 
attachers to provide written notice to 
utilities of forthcoming pole attachment 
orders for orders exceeding 300 poles or 
0.5 percent of the utility’s poles in a 
state up to the lesser of 3,000 poles or 
5 percent of a utility’s poles in the state 
associated with a single network 
deployment and for orders exceeding 
the lesser of 3,000 poles or 5 percent of 
a utility’s poles in the state up to the 
lesser of 6,000 poles or ten percent of a 
utility’s poles in a state; (2) that an 
attacher that fails to provide timely 
advance notice of such orders must, 
upon prompt notice from the utility, 
still wait the relevant advance notice 
period before the applicable timeline 
begins; (3) a meet-and-confer following 
the requisite advance notice for orders 
exceeding the lesser of 3,000 poles or 
five percent of a utility’s poles in a state 
up to the lesser of 6,000 poles or ten 
percent of a utility’s poles in a state; and 
(4) a new set of timelines for utilities to 
complete each pole access phase for 
large orders. 
The Commission further revised its 
pole attachment timelines as follows: (1) 
require utilities to notify attachers 
within 15 days of receiving a complete 
application if they know or reasonably 
should know that they cannot meet the 
survey deadline, and require utilities to 
notify attachers within 15 days of 
payment of the estimate, and existing 
attachers to notify utilities and new 
attachers within 15 days of receiving 
notice from the utility, if they know or 
reasonably should know that they 
cannot meet the make-ready deadline; 
(2) add a self-help remedy for make- 
ready estimates, provided certain 
safeguards are met; and (3) prohibit 
utility-imposed limits on application 
size and frequency that have the effect 
of restricting the number of pole 
attachments attachers may seek in a 
given timeframe. 
Section 1.1412. In the Order, the 
Commission adopted improvements to 
the contractor approval process by 
requiring utilities to respond to a 
request to add contractors to a utility- 
approved list within 30 days of 
receiving the request.

The Commission may also investigate whether 
a foreign government or ocean common carrier’s 
practices result in adverse impacts on U.S. carriers 
or U.S. oceanborne trade or creates conditions that 
do not exist for foreign carriers in the United States 
under the laws of the United States. 46 U.S. Code, 
Chapter 423. The Commission is not investigating 
Spain’s practices under Chapter 423 at this time but 
may do so in the future. 
Under other statutory authority, the Commission 
can also investigate whether a foreign government 
is unduly impairing the access of a vessel 
documented under the laws of the United States to 
ocean trade between foreign ports and take action 
it finds appropriate to remedy any such violation. 
46 U.S.C. 41108(d); see also 46 CFR 560.1–560.9. 
The Commission is not investigating Spain under 
this provision at this time but would benefit from

taking actions that limit U.S. flag vessels of any 
kind from accessing ocean trade between foreign 
ports.

Government of Spain (Spain) is denying 
port access to certain vessels and seeks 
further public comment about ongoing 
restrictions imposed by Spain that 
appear to create conditions unfavorable

as measures the Commission could 
consider to eliminate or counterbalance 
those restrictions.

I. Introduction 
The Commission initiated this 
investigation in December 2024 under 
Title 46 U.S.C. Chapter 421 to determine 
whether Spain is creating general or 
special conditions unfavorable to 
shipping in U.S. foreign trade by barring 
certain vessels from its ports, including 
vessels transporting cargo under the 
United States Maritime 
Administration’s (MARAD) Maritime 
Security Program (MSP). Docket No. 24– 
30. Initial reports that prompted this 
investigation indicated that Spain had 
refused port access in November 2024 to 
three vessels operating under the MSP 
on the grounds that they were carrying 
cargo bound for or coming from Israel. 
Spain reportedly cited European Union 
(EU) regulations as the basis for these 
port refusals. 
The Commission published a notice 
of investigation and request for 
comments in the Federal Register on 
December 6, 2024. Investigation into 
Conditions Affecting Shipping in the 
Foreign Trade and Denial of Entry of 
Vessels into Spanish Ports, 89 FR 96973 
(Dec. 6, 2024). That request resulted in 
over 8,000 comments from the public 
and interested parties. Many comments 
expressed views about Spain’s policy 
based on views about Israel. That is not 
part of this investigation, which is 
focused only on maintaining the 
reliability and efficiency of the U.S. 
ocean shipping supply chain, including 
whether Spain is refusing docking 
privileges to certain vessels, and if so, 
how Spain’s refusal of docking 
privileges is affecting shipping in U.S. 
foreign trade. 
Information from multiple sources 
confirmed the original reports that 
between November 9 and 14, 2024, 
Spain refused docking privileges to 
three U.S. flagged vessels operating 
under the MSP. Spain refused docking 
privileges at the APM terminals in 
Algeciras, Spain on November 9, 2024, 
for the Maersk Denver
1
and Maersk Nysted and on November 14, 2024, for the Maersk Seletar. Each of these vessels was operating under the U.S. flag and 
was operated or supplied by Maersk 
Line Limited. Though not a participant 
in the MSP, another vessel appears to 
have been refused docking privileges by 
Spain in May 2024. ‘‘Spain Denies Port 
of Call to Ship Carrying Arms to Israel,’’ 
The Guardian (May 16, 2024), https://
www.theguardian.com/world/article/ 
2024/may/16/spain-denies-port-of-call- 
to-ship-carrying-arms-to-israel. 
The Government of Spain justifies 
these denials as supported by its right 
to exercise sovereign authority over its 
ports and follow its interpretation of 
Spanish, EU, and international law, 
which is not disputed by the 
Commission in conducting this 
investigation. Evidence from Spain and 
other sources indicates that Spain 
maintains the position that it is justified 
under Spanish, EU, and international 
law in refusing port access to certain 
vessels and will continue to do so based 
on the nature of the cargo and where it 
originated or is bound for. On 
September 8, 2025, the Government of 
Spain announced a multi-faceted policy 
aimed at halting the flow of certain 
cargo bound for or coming from Israel 
through air or marine transport. 
Measures it announced include banning 
ships and aircraft carrying weapons 
bound for Israel or tankers carrying fuel 
for use by the Israeli military from using 
Spanish ports and airspace.

II. Current Status and Appropriate 
Countermeasures 
Spain’s recent announcement and 
information from multiple sources 
indicate that the basic conditions the 
Commission initiated this investigation 
to address still exist and are likely 
creating general or special conditions 
unfavorable to shipping in U.S. foreign 
commerce. Section 42101 authorizes the 
Commission to investigate and take 
action regarding conditions unfavorable 
to shipping in foreign trade, ‘‘whether in 
a particular trade or on a particular 
route or in commerce generally . . . 
which arise out of or result from laws 
or regulations of a foreign country.’’ 46 
U.S.C. 42101(a).
3
This authority is 
linked to and supports objectives 
defined in 46 U.S.C. 50101(a), which 
include furthering the United States’ 
interest in a merchant marine capable of 
carrying a ‘‘substantial part’’ of 
waterborne export and import U.S. 
foreign commerce and providing 
‘‘shipping service essential for 
maintaining the flow of the waterborne 
domestic and foreign commerce at all 
times.’’ Id. Other objectives defined by section 50101(a) include fostering a 
merchant marine ‘‘capable of serving as 
a naval and military auxiliary in time of 
war or national emergency’’ and 
‘‘owned and operated as vessels of the 
United States by citizens of the United 
States.’’ Id. The Commission is charged with 
investigating conditions defined in 
sections 42101 and 50101 and 
determining whether to take remedial 
action. See 46 U.S.C. 42101(a)–42109. In carrying out a section 42101 
investigation, the Commission is 
authorized to solicit public comments, 
conduct discovery, and subpoena 
witnesses and evidence. Id., 42104. Remedies the Commission can 
implement to adjust or meet unfavorable 
conditions to shipping in the foreign 
trade of the United States include 
adopting regulations restricting voyages 
to or from U.S. ports, imposing per 
voyage fees, limiting amounts or types 
of cargo, or taking ‘‘any other action the

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with NOTICES59828 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Notices Commission finds necessary and 
appropriate to adjust or meet any 
condition unfavorable to shipping the 
foreign trade of the United States.’’ 46 
U.S.C. 42101(a) and 42106(1), (4) and 
(5); see also 46 CFR 550.601. The Commission may also request the 
Secretary of the Department of 
Homeland Security to refuse entry or 
clearance to vessels, collect fees 
imposed by the Commission, or detain 
a vessel about to depart from a U.S. port. 
46 U.S.C. 42107(1) and (2). 
As described, the Commission has 
broad jurisdiction under 46 U.S.C. 
42101 to investigate and take action to 
remediate conditions resulting from the 
laws or regulations of foreign 
governments that are unfavorable to 
shipping in U.S. foreign trade, whether 
in a particular trade or on a particular 
route or in commerce generally. See 46 U.S.C. 42101(a). Regulatory action is 
appropriate ‘‘when the Commission 
finds . . . that a foreign government has 
promulgated and enforced or intends to 
enforce laws, decrees, regulations or the 
like, or has engaged in or intends to 
engage in practices which presently 
have or prospectively could create 
conditions unfavorable to shipping in 
the foreign trade of the United States.’’ 
46 CFR 550.102. Laws or policies 
enforced by a foreign government that 
refuse entry to vessels documented 
under the laws of the United States are 
inconsistent with the Commission’s 
statutory mission to ensure access to the 
complex and interdependent system for 
the common carriage of goods by water 
in foreign commerce, and the goal of 
maintaining a healthy U.S. merchant 
marine. 
The Commission now requests further 
comments on whether Spain is creating 
general or special conditions 
unfavorable to shipping in foreign trade, 
and if so, what remedial actions the 
Commission should consider. 
Information about the following would 
assist in advancing the Commission’s 
investigation and helping it determine 
whether remedial action is appropriate: 
(1) any additional confirmed reports of 
Spain, including any governmental 
component and/or any private sector 
entity, directly or indirectly refusing 
port access or docking privileges to any 
vessels, including U.S. flag vessels, 
transporting cargo on routes bound for 
or coming from Israel; (2) reasons stated 
by Spain, including any governmental 
component and/or any private sector 
entity, for refusing port access or 
docking privileges; (3) whether the 
refusal(s) were conditional or absolute 
(i.e., whether measures or steps that could be taken to be granted port access 
were described); (4) whether Spain, 
including any governmental component 
and/or any private sector entity, offered 
any alternatives or options; and (5) 
factual information about the impact 
any such refusals or denials had on 
vessel routes, schedules, transfer of 
cargo to other vessels or ports other than 
designated destinations, or on maritime 
commerce generally. 
Information or perspectives about the 
following would be helpful in the event 
the Commission determines that 
remedial action is warranted: (1) 
information concerning vessels 
connected to Spain, whether through 
flagging or some other link, such as 
incorporation or headquarters location, 
calling at U.S. ports, including tankers 
and other types of commercial vessels; 
(2) information concerning types or 
amounts of cargo that could be 
appropriately limited in trade between 
the United States and Spain; and (3) 
suggestions for any other action the 
Commission might find necessary to 
adjust or meet the unfavorable shipping 
conditions Spain appears to have 
created through its port access 
restrictions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) 
(44 U.S.C. 3501–3520), federal agencies 
must obtain approval from the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) for each 
collection of information they conduct 
or sponsor. In addition, the PRA also 
requires federal agencies to provide a 
60-day notice in the Federal Register 
concerning each proposed collection of 
information, including each new 
proposed collection, each proposed 
extension of existing collection of 
information, and each reinstatement of 
previously approved information 
collection before submitting the 
collection to the OMB for approval. To 
comply with this requirement, we are 
publishing this notice of a proposed 
data collection as described below. 
The OMB is particularly interested in 
comments that will help: 
1. Evaluate whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary 
for the proper performance of the 
functions of the agency, including 
whether the information will have 
practical utility; 
2. Evaluate the accuracy of the 
agency’s estimate of the burden of the 
proposed collection of information, 
including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used; 
3. Enhance the quality, utility, and 
clarity of the information to be 
collected; 
4. Minimize the burden of the 
collection of information on those who 
are to respond, including through the 
use of appropriate automated, 
electronic, mechanical, or other 
technological collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology, 
e.g., permitting electronic submissions of responses; and 
5. Assess information collection costs.

Background and Brief Description 
The Agency for Toxic Substances and 
Disease Registry (ATSDR) is requesting 
a three-year Paperwork Reduction Act 
(PRA) clearance for a Revision 
Information Collection Request (ICR) 
titled the ‘‘The National Amyotrophic 
Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Registry’’ (OMB

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with NOTICES59830 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Notices Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 
(ATSDR) to: (1) develop a system to 
collect data on amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS) and other motor neuron 
disorders that can be confused with 
ALS, misdiagnosed as ALS, or progress 
to ALS; and (2) establish a national 
registry for the collection and storage of 
such data to develop a population-based 
registry of cases. Under these two 
mandates, ATSDR established the 
National Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
(ALS) Registry. 
The primary operational goal of the 
Registry is to obtain reliable information 
on the incidence and prevalence of ALS, 
and to better describe the demographic 
characteristics (age, race, sex, and 
geographic location) of persons with 
ALS. The secondary operational goal of 
the surveillance system/registry is to 
collect additional information on 
potential risk factors for ALS, including, 
but not limited to, family history of 
ALS, smoking history, military service, 
residential history, lifetime 
occupational exposure, home pesticide 
use, hobbies, participation in sports, 
hormonal and reproductive history 
(women only), caffeine use, trauma, 
health insurance, open-ended 
supplemental questions, and clinical 
signs and symptoms. 
With those goals in mind, persons 
with ALS first joined the Registry in 
2010. Those interested in taking part 
answered a series of validation 
questions. If determined to be eligible, 
they created an online account to enroll 
in the Registry. Next, they were asked to 
complete up to 17 one-time voluntary 
survey modules, each taking up to five 
minutes. New registrants were also 
asked to complete a longitudinal disease 
progression survey (modified from the 
ALS Functional Rating Scale—Revised 
[ALSFRS–R]) at regular intervals over 
their first three years in the Registry. 
A biorepository component was 
added in 2016. At the time of 
enrollment, interested registrants can 
request additional information about the 
biorepository and provide additional 
contact information. ATSDR selects a 
geographically representative sample 
from among the interested registrants to 
collect specimens. There are two types 
of specimen collections, in-home and 
postmortem. The in-home collection 
includes blood, urine, hair, nails, and 
saliva. The postmortem collection 
includes the brain, spinal cord, cerebral 
spinal fluid (CSF), bone, muscle, and 
skin. 
Researchers can now request access to 
registrants’ specimens, data, or both 
through an ATSDR research application 
process. Once approved for scientific 
merit, validity, and human subjects 
protections, ATSDR makes the 
requested data and/or specimens 
available to the requester. ATSDR also 
collaborates with ALS service 
organizations to conduct outreach 
activities through their local chapters 
and districts as well as on a national 
level. The service organizations provide 
ATSDR with monthly reports on their 
outreach efforts in support of the 
Registry. 
In addition to identifying cases 
through Registry enrollment, ATSDR 
currently identifies additional cases 
from three large national administrative 
databases (Medicare, Veterans Health 
Administration, and Veterans Benefits 
Administration). As a third revision, 
ATSDR aims to achieve more complete 
ALS case ascertainment by adding new 
data sources (totaling less than nine), 
including state ALS registries and non- 
profit ALS organizations. 
Since the last continuation, there have 
been only minor updates to documents. 
All changes have been approved by the 
organization’s IRB. These changes have 
no impact on the burden hours. This is 
a Revision request for PRA clearance for 
the 60-day ICR package. The revisions 
requested are designed to strengthen the 
usefulness of the National ALS Registry 
for researchers. The revisions include: 
1. Updating the Consent Form to 
include the addition of an interagency 
data exchange between Unite Genomics 
and the National ALS Registry. 
Participants will have the opportunity 
to share personal information relating to 
their health history with ATSDR 
through an integration between the 
Registry portal and a third-party online 
platform called Unite Genomics. This 
update will not impact burden hours. 
2. As required by the E.O. in February 
2025, all use of the term ‘‘gender’’ has 
been replaced with ‘‘sex.’’ All changes 
made are minor changes to terminology 
as the current protocol only collects 
data on the registrant’s sex (male/ 
female). Changes have been made 
throughout the documents. 
3. The OMB package being submitted 
reflects changes recently approved by 
IRB to the ALS Biorepository premortem 
patient consent forms for the 
biospecimen (D2) and saliva (D4) 
collection. The changes include the 
addition of the language describing 
genomic data sharing and associated 
risk for both Appendix D2 and D4, 
clarification on the limited use of 
established cell line for commercial gain 
for Appendix D2, and absence of cell 
line establishment for commercial gain 
for Appendix D4. Furthermore, updates 
have been made for the ALS research 
application forms (M1) in Part B to 
include a biospecimen sample and 
aliquot sizes that were not previously 
listed, in Part C to add a postmortem 
sample and price that was not 
previously listed, and to include a new 
form ‘‘Part E’’ which is only applicable 
to the researchers making changes to 
their formerly approved application 
such as their affiliation status or 
additional sample request for the same 
study. 
CDC requests OMB approval for an 
estimated 1,757 annual burden hours. 
There are no costs to the respondents 
other than their time. Participation in 
this information collection is 
completely voluntary for persons with 
ALS and for researchers. ALS service 
organizations report their outreach 
information under contract with 
ATSDR.

Proposed Project 
The Greater Access and Impact with 
NAT (GAIN) Study: Improving HIV 
Diagnosis, Linkage to Care, and 
Prevention Services with HIV Point-of- 
Care Nucleic Acid Tests (NATs) (OMB 
Control No. 0920–1357)— 
Reinstatement—National Center for 
HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, TB 
Prevention (NCHHSTP), Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
Background and Brief Description 
The CDC is requesting reapproval for 
three years of the data collection titled 
The Greater Access and Impact with 
NAT (GAIN) Study: Improving HIV 
Diagnosis, Linkage to Care, and 
Prevention Services with HIV Point-of- 
Care Nucleic Acid Tests (NATs). The 
purpose of this information collection is 
to determine the acceptability and 
feasibility of HIV point of care nucleic 
acid tests (POC NAT) for HIV in clinical 
and community settings. Current rapid 
POC technologies do not reliably detect 
the earliest HIV infections and lab-based 
testing can introduce delays while 
patients wait for test results. During this 
time, patients can drop out of care and 
are still at high-risk to become infected. 
POC NATs can identify early HIV 
infections, which have high potential 
for transmission. POC NATs have the 
potential to help address some of the 
remaining challenges to ending the HIV 
epidemic in the United States by 
assisting with early detection of acute 
HIV infection and by providing a more 
efficient viral load monitoring tool for 
people living with HIV. This study is 
the first of its kind in the U.S. and is 
critical to understanding the feasibility 
and acceptability of POC NAT use in the 
U.S. 
Data collected during this study will 
be used to evaluate the performance of 
POC NAT and associated clinical 
outcomes, patient and provider 
perspectives regarding acceptability and 
feasibility, and implementation science 
outcomes. The GAIN study will 
develop, implement, and evaluate 
models for use of POC NAT among HIV- 
negative persons seeking HIV testing, 
PEP, and PrEP and HIV-positive persons 
in community and clinical settings. 
Prior to study expiration in December 
2024, the GAIN project was successful 
in meeting several information 
collection goals. GAIN is on track to 
reach remaining data collection targets 
and successfully conclude this 
important information collection if the 
study is reinstated. A limited number of 
data collection activities remain to be 
completed; therefore, the annual 
number of respondents needed to 
complete the study have been reduced 
from 3,494 to 150. Accordingly, the

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with NOTICES59832 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Notices annualized burden will also decrease 
from 880 to 49 hours. GAIN study 
stakeholders noted several opportunities 
to improve the participant experience 
and improve data quality by refining 
existing tools and collecting additional 
data; therefore, we propose the addition 
of three new study instruments and 
minor revisions to four study 
instruments. 
The study will be carried out in 
Seattle, Washington at two locations: 
the Gay City community center and the 
Madison Clinic. Gay City is the largest 
community-based testing program in 
Washington. Madison Clinic is the 
largest provider of HIV care in the state. 
Upon reinstatement, GAIN will engage 
four types of participants: (1) persons 
living with HIV (PLWH) and receiving 
care at Madison Clinic; (2) individuals 
enrolled in GAIN at the community 
center prior to study expiration; (3) 
health providers at Madison Clinic; and 
(4) clinic staff from both study locations. 
All participants will be at least 18 years 
of age and able to read and speak 
English. 
In order to complete our evaluation of 
the impact of POC NAT on time to 
virologic suppression among PLWH 
receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), 
we will enroll 61 PLWH who are 
receiving ART at Madison Clinic. 
Participants will be recruited using a 
combination of approaches including 
in-person outreach, health provider 
referrals, and printed media (flyers) 
displayed in the clinic. Following 
screening and enrollment, a computer- 
assisted quantitative survey will collect 
participant demographics and 
information about substance use, pre- 
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use, and 
antiretroviral therapy (ART). Following 
the study visit, a web link to the online 
acceptability survey will be sent to them 
via email. The survey will collect 
information about participants’ 
knowledge about their POC NAT 
results, their perception about the 
accuracy of those results, and their level 
of confidence in the results. The survey 
will also collect information about test 
result sharing, HIV treatment and test 
result knowledge and beliefs, ART 
adherence, and communications with 
their provider. A subset of the cohort 
will be randomly selected by study staff 
and invited to participate in a focus 
group or interview to further explore 
their experiences and preferences for 
HIV testing, and to evaluate their 
reactions to the intervention. Interviews 
and focus groups may be conducted in 
person or remotely via a secure, 
teleconference platform. 
A subset of participants who were 
enrolled at Gay City will be randomly 
selected, contacted by study staff via 
telephone, and invited to participate in 
a brief survey. Depending on the group 
they were enrolled in, the survey will 
collect information to determine if the 
participant initiated PrEP, engaged in 
HIV care, or is successfully taking ART. 
Study staff may call a participant up to 
three times to discuss the outcome of 
their study visit. The five-minute survey 
will provide the information needed to 
evaluate the impact of POC NAT on the 
outcomes of respondents who 
participated in the GAIN study at the 
community center. 
Health providers and clinic staff at 
Madison Clinic who referred patients to 
the GAIN study and saw patients 
enrolled in the study will be invited by 
study staff, either in person or via email, 
to participate in an interview to describe 
their experiences with POC NAT and 
preferences for HIV testing. Participants 
will have the option to attend the 
interview in-person or remotely via 
telephone or a teleconference platform. 
Providers will be invited to complete up 
to three interviews over the course of 
the study in order to capture the 
provider experience over time and in 
varying clinical scenarios. Clinic staff 
with expertise in electronic health 
record management will be engaged at 
each of the study sites to collect medical 
record data, including test dates and 
results. 
Data will be collected from a total of 
181 individuals over the three-year data 
collection period, including 61 PLWH 
receiving care at Madison Clinic; 18 
health providers at Madison Clinic; 100 
participants at the Gay City center; and 
two clinic employees. For PLWH 
participants, we estimate that we will 
need to screen 122 individuals (41 
annually) to reach total enrollment. The 
screening process will take 
approximately five minutes to complete. 
Following enrollment, 61 participants 
(21 annually) will complete the Release 
of Information form which will take five 
minutes to complete. The study visit 
survey will take 15 minutes to complete 
and will be delivered to 61 participants 
(21 annually) once. A total of 61 
participants (21 annually) will complete 
the acceptability survey which will take 
20 minutes to complete. A subset of 
participants (12 total, four annually) 
will be invited to participate in a focus 
group or interview which may take up 
to one hour to complete. A follow-up 
telephone survey will be conducted 
with participants who were enrolled at 
Gay City (100 total, 34 annually). The 
survey will take five minutes to 
complete, and participants may be 
called up to three times. Health 
providers (18 total, six annually) at 
Madison Clinic will be invited to 
participate in up to three interviews 
which will take 45 minutes to complete. 
One clinic employee at each of the two 
study sites will be engaged to collect 
medical record data. The Madison 
Clinic will perform an automated data 
collection, estimated to take five 
minutes, once every two months (six 
times annually). Gay City center will 
perform a manual data pull, estimated 
to take one hour, once every six months. 
CDC is requesting OMB approval for 
135 total burden hours across three 
years of data collection. The total 
estimated annualized burden hours are 
49. Participation of respondents is 
voluntary. There is no cost to 
participants other than their time.

Revision—National Center for Emerging 
Zoonotic and Infections Disease 
(NCEZID), Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC). 
Background and Brief Description 
The Division of Healthcare Quality 
Promotion (DHQP), National Center for 
Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious 
Diseases (NCEZID), Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) collects 
COVID–19 and respiratory virus data 
from healthcare facilities in the National 
Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) 
under OMB Control Number 0920–1317. 
NHSN is the only national system that 
collects surveillance data on healthcare- 
associated infections, infection 
prevention process measures, healthcare 
personnel safety measures, such as 
blood and body fluid exposures and 
vaccination practices, and adverse 
events related to the transfusion of 
blood and blood products. The NHSN 
existing platform allows facilities to 
share data immediately with local, state, 
and national partners for impact 
monitoring, decision-making, and 
surveillance activities. 
The NHSN Respiratory Data Modules 
are designed to standardize the data 
elements collected across the country 
regarding the impact of the COVID–19 
and other respiratory viruses on 
healthcare facilities. In collecting 
standardized data, NHSN provides a 
vendor-neutral platform and a national 
lens into the burden hospitals are 
experiencing in a way that is designed 
to support the public health response. 
NHSN is a platform that exists in nearly 
all acute-care hospitals, nursing homes, 
and dialysis facilities in the US and can 
provide a secure, sturdy infrastructure. 
The current Revision request is 
submitted to: (1) change the official 
name of the data collection; (2) make 
small changes to language and wording 
of NHSN questions; (3) modify 
questions to comply with Executive 
Orders; and (4) revise burden and cost 
estimates. CDC requests OMB approval 
for an estimated 1,725,736 annual 
burden hours. There are no costs to 
respondents other than their time to 
participate.

detailed information can be found in 
each collection’s supporting statement 
and associated materials (see 
ADDRESSES). 
Under the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501– 
3520), federal agencies must obtain 
approval from the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) for each collection of 
information they conduct or sponsor. 
The term ‘‘collection of information’’ is 
defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 
1320.3(c) and includes agency requests 
or requirements that members of the 
public submit reports, keep records, or 
provide information to a third party. 
Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA 
requires federal agencies to publish a 
60-day notice in the Federal Register 
concerning each proposed collection of 
information, including each proposed 
extension or reinstatement of an existing 
collection of information, before 
submitting the collection to OMB for 
approval. To comply with this 
requirement, CMS is publishing this 
notice. 
Information Collections 
1. Type of Information Collection Request: Revision of a currently approved collection; Title of 
Information Collection: CMS Plan 
Benefit Package (PBP) and Formulary 
CY 2027; Use: Under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and 
Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), and 
implementing regulations at 42 CFR, 
specifically § 422.254 and § 423.265, 
Medicare Advantage (MA) and 
Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) 
organizations are required to submit a 
bid for each plan they intend to offer in 
their service area for the upcoming year. 
In addition to actuarial pricing, which is 
addressed in OMB 0938–0944, each bid 
submission consists of a description of 
the plan benefit package and the plan 
formulary. MA and PDP organizations 
use the Plan Benefit Package (PBP) 
software to describe their organization’s 
plan benefit packages, including 
information on premiums, cost sharing, 
authorization rules, and supplemental 
benefits. They also generate a formulary 
to describe their list of drugs, including 
information on prior authorization, step 
therapy, tiering, and quantity limits. 
CMS uses the PBP and formulary data 
to review and approve the plan benefit 
packages proposed by each MA and PDP 
organization. 
CMS requires that MA and PDP 
organizations submit a completed PBP 
and formulary as part of the annual 
bidding process. During this process, 
organizations prepare their proposed 
plan benefit packages for the upcoming 
contract year and submit them to CMS 
for review and approval. CMS uses this 
data to review and approve the benefit 
packages that the plans will offer to 
Medicare beneficiaries. This allows 
CMS to review the benefit packages in 
a consistent way across all submitted 
bids during with incredibly tight 
timeframes. This data is also used to 
populate data on Medicare Plan Finder, 
which allows beneficiaries to access and 
compare Medicare Advantage and 
Prescription Drug plans. Form Number: 
CMS–R–262 (OMB control number: 
0938–0763); Frequency: Yearly; Affected Public: Private sector, Business or other for-profits, Not-for-profits institutions; 
Number of Respondents: 764; Number of Responses: 8,068; Total Annual Hours: 44,178. (For policy questions regarding this collection contact Kristy

2. Type of Information Collection Request: Revision of a currently approved collection; Title of 
Information Collection: Medicare Part C 
and Part D Program Audit and Industry- 
Wide Part C Timeliness Monitoring 
Project (TMP) Protocols; Use: CMS is responsible for overseeing the Medicare 
Advantage (MA) and Part D programs to 
ensure that beneficiaries receive 
appropriate and timely benefits, 
services, and drugs. Under Sections 
1857(d) and 1860D–12 of the Social 
Security Act, and related regulations at 
42 CFR 422.503, 422.504, 422.516, 
423.504, and 423.505, CMS has the 
authority to inspect, evaluate, and 
monitor the benefits provided by 
Sponsoring organizations. To carry out 
this oversight, Sponsoring organizations 
must provide CMS with access to 
relevant records, documentation, and 
systems. They are also required to report 
information on service utilization and 
other data as requested by CMS to 
confirm ongoing compliance with 
program requirements. CMS uses the 
data collected by way of these audit 
protocols to thoroughly assess whether 
Sponsoring organizations are meeting 
specific federal requirements. 
The information gathered during this 
program audit will be used by the 
Medicare Parts C and D Oversight and 
Enforcement Group (MOEG) within the 
Center for Medicare (CM) to assess 
Sponsoring organizations’ compliance 
with Medicare program requirements. 
MOEG reviews submitted data and 
selected samples from that data to 
ensure appropriate enrollee access to 
benefits, services and drugs. 
Specifically, CMS reviews data to 
ensure Part D organizations are 
administering their formulary and 
transition benefit in accordance with 
their CMS-approved formulary; CMS 
reviews coverage requests and appeals 
to ensure regulatory requirements are 
followed when enrollees request 
services; and, if the audited MA 
organization offers a SNP, MOEG’s 
review evaluates whether the SNP is 
coordinating care in accordance with 
CMS requirements. Form Number: 
CMS–10717 (OMB control number: 
0938–1395); Frequency: Annually; Affected Public: Private sector, State, 
Local, or Tribal Governments, Federal 
Government, Business or other for- 
profits, Not-for-Profit Institutions; 
Number of Respondents: 30; Total Annual Responses: 30; Total Annual Hours: 12,045. (For policy questions regarding this collection contact

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Contents 
This notice sets out a summary of the 
use and burden associated with the 
following information collections. More 
detailed information can be found in 
each collection’s supporting statement 
and associated materials (see 
ADDRESSES). 
Under the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501– 
3520), federal agencies must obtain 
approval from the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) for each collection of 
information they conduct or sponsor. 
The term ‘‘collection of information’’ is 
defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 
1320.3(c) and includes agency requests 
or requirements that members of the 
public submit reports, keep records, or 
provide information to a third party. 
Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA 
requires federal agencies to publish a 
60-day notice in the Federal Register 
concerning each proposed collection of 
information, including each proposed 
extension or reinstatement of an existing 
collection of information, before 
submitting the collection to OMB for 
approval. To comply with this 
requirement, CMS is publishing this 
notice. 
Information Collections 
1. Type of Information Collection Request: Revision of a currently approved collection; Title of 
Information Collection: External Quality 
Review (EQR) of Medicaid and 
Children’s Health Insurance Program 
(CHIP) Managed Care, EQR Protocols, 
and Supporting Regulations; Use: Most contracts between a state Medicaid 
agency and their managed care plan 
must provide for an annual External 
Quality Review (EQR). The annual EQR 
is conducted by an independent 
external quality review organization 
(EQRO). States must provide the EQRO 
with information obtained through 
methods consistent with the protocols 
specified by CMS. The information is 
used by the EQRO to determine the 
quality of care furnished by the 
managed care plans in the state. The 
publicly posted EQR results allows 
Medicaid/CHIP enrollees and potential 
enrollees to make informed choices 
regarding the selection of their 
providers. It also provides advocacy 
organizations, researchers, and other 
interested parties access to information 
on the quality of care provided to 
Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in 
Medicaid/CHIP managed care. States 
use the information during their 
oversight of these organizations. Form 
Number: CMS–R–305 (OMB control number: 0938–0786); Frequency: 
Annually and one-time; Affected Public: 
Private sector and State, Local or Tribal 
Governments; Number of Respondents: 681; Number of Responses: 7,236; Total Annual Hours: 887,086. (For policy 
questions regarding this collection 
contact Carrie Hanlon at 410–786– 
1660.) 
2. Type of Information Collection Request: Extension of a currently approved collection; Title of 
Information Collection: Medicaid Drug 
Program; Use: Labelers transmit drug product and pricing data to CMS within 
30 days after the end of each calendar 
month and quarter. CMS calculates the 
unit rebate amount (URA) and the unit 
rebate offset amount (UROA) for each 
new drug application (NDC) and 
distributes to all State Medicaid 
agencies. States use the URA to invoice 
the labeler for rebates and the UROA to 
report onto CMS–64. The monthly data 
is used to calculate Federal Upper Limit 
(FUL) prices for applicable drugs and 
for states that opt to use this data to 
establish their pharmacy reimbursement 
methodology. Form Number: CMS– 367a–e (OMB control number: 0938– 
0578); Frequency: Monthly, quarterly, and on occasion; Affected Public: 
Private sector; Number of Respondents: 
840; Total Annual Responses: 16,160; Total Annual Hours: 606,932. (For

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) 
(44 U.S.C. 3501–3520), federal agencies 
must obtain approval from the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) for each 
collection of information they conduct

requirements that members of the public 
submit reports, keep records, or provide 
information to a third party. Section 
3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA (44 U.S.C. 
3506(c)(2)(A)) requires federal agencies 
to publish a 30-day notice in the 
Federal Register concerning each 
proposed collection of information, 
including each proposed extension or 
reinstatement of an existing collection 
of information, before submitting the 
collection to OMB for approval. To 
comply with this requirement, CMS is 
publishing this notice that summarizes 
the following proposed collection(s) of 
information for public comment. 
1. Type of Information Collection Request: Extension of a currently approved collection; Title of 
Information Collection: Medical 
Necessity and Contract Amendments 
Under Mental Health Parity; Use: Upon request, regulated entities must provide 
a medical necessity disclosure. 
Receiving this information will enable 
potential and current enrollees to make 
more educated decisions given the 
choices available to them through their 
plans and may result in better treatment 
of their mental health or substance use 
disorder (MH/SUD) conditions. States 
use the information collected and

beneficiaries, the state will review the 
parity analysis provided by the MCO to 
confirm that the MCO benefits are 
compliant. CMS uses the information 
collected and reported in an oversight 
role of State Medicaid managed care 
programs. Form Number: CMS–10556 (OMB control number: 0938–1280);

AGENCY: Office of Community Services, Administration for Children and

ACTION: Request for public comments. SUMMARY: The Office of Community Services (OCS), Administration for 
Children and Families (ACF), U.S. 
Department of Health and Human 
Services is requesting a 3-year extension 
of the Community Economic 
Development (CED) Performance 
Progress Report (PPR) (Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) #: 
0970–0386), expiration date February 
28, 2026, with revisions to support a 
quarterly reporting schedule. This 
request updates burden estimates to 
account for new quarterly reporting 
requirements. While the core CED PPR 
form remains unchanged and will still 
be submitted semi-annually, new 
awardees must now report quarterly. In 
alternate quarters (Q1 and Q3), they will 
complete a shorter version of the form 
with narrative updates only. 
DATES: Comments due January 21, 2026. ADDRESSES: The public may view and comment on this information collection 
request at: https://www.reginfo.gov/ 
public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_
nbr=202512-0970-006. You can obtain copies of the proposed collection of 
information and submit comments by 
emailing infocollection@acf.hhs.gov. Identify all requests by the title of the 
information collection. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Description: OCS is seeking to extend the CED PPR (OMB #: 0970–0386), with 
revisions, for three years. This extension 
will permit OCS to continue collecting 
the performance progress information 
about projects funded through the CED 
program from current and future grant 
recipients. 
The CED PPR collects information 
regarding the implementation and 
outcomes of CED projects to support 
program monitoring, the provision of 
training and technical assistance, and 
the fulfillment of congressional 
reporting requirements. The report 
tracks quantitative information, 
including measures of job creation and 
project expenditures, along with 
narrative descriptions of project 
activities, challenges, and changes. 
The CED PPR will continue to be 
administered to all active grant 
recipients of the CED program. Grant 
recipients will complete this report 
based on activities completed through 
the second and fourth quarters of each 
project year. 
This request revises the burden 
estimates to reflect new reporting 
requirements for quarterly reporting. 
The burden estimates reflect quarterly 
reporting for new awardees as well as a 
shorter response time for quarterly 
reporters in alternate quarters when 
they will only be required to complete 
a subset of items on the form. This 
request makes no changes to the current 
approved CED PPR form that all grant 
recipients will be required to complete 
semi-annually. The current approved 
CED PPR is cumulative and covers 
activities completed through the second 
and fourth quarters of each project year. 
For the first and third quarters of each 
project year, quarterly reporters will 
complete a subset of items to provide 
narrative updates on project progress. 
Currently, grant recipients submit the 
CED PPR semi-annually. Through this 
request, OCS proposes to change the 
reporting requirements to collect 
information on CED project progress on 
a quarterly basis. This will allow OCS 
to monitor grant recipient progress more 
frequently and to support the timely 
provision of training and technical 
assistance. The reporting schedule for 
CED projects will be identified in the 
Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) 
under which projects are funded. In the 
past, CED NOFOs identified a semi- 
annual reporting schedule. Quarterly 
reporting requirements were included in 
the federal fiscal year (FFY) 2025 NOFO 
for the first time. 
To reduce the burden for quarterly 
reporters, OCS will only require grant 
recipients to complete a subset of items 
from the CED PPR in the first and third 
quarters of each project year. The 
burden estimates for the subset of items 
are included in the annual burden 
estimates for the CED PPR Short Form. 
The CED PPR Short Form does not 
include the quantitative measures and 
focuses on narrative descriptions of 
project activities, challenges, and 
changes. 
Respondents: The CED PPR will be completed by all CED grant recipients 
active during the 3-year extension. The 
CED PPR Short Form will be completed 
by grant recipients receiving awards 
through an application to a NOFO 
requiring quarterly reporting. 
Annual Burden Estimates 
OCS anticipates including quarterly 
reporting requirements in NOFOs 
published in FFY 2025 and later. 
Because CED projects are funded for 3- 
to 4-year project periods, OCS 
anticipates that only half of active grant 
recipients will be required to complete 
the short-form during the extension 
period. These assumptions are reflected 
in the burden estimates below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Description: ORR reimburses, to the extent of available appropriations, 
certain non-federal costs for the 
provision of CMA to refugees, along 
with allowable expenses for the 
administration of the refugee 
resettlement program at the state level. 
States and Replacement Designees 
currently submit the ORR–2 Quarterly 
Report on Expenditures and 
Obligations, which provides aggregate 
expenditure and obligation data. The 
ORR–2 collects expenditures and 
obligations data separately for each of 
the following four CMA program 
components: refugee cash assistance, 
refugee medical assistance, CMA 
administration, and services for 
unaccompanied refugee minors. This 
breakdown of financial status data 
allows ORR to track program 
expenditures in greater detail to 
anticipate any funding issues and to 
meet the requirements of ORR 
regulations at 45 CFR 400.211 to collect 
these data for use in estimating future 
costs of the refugee resettlement 
program. ORR must implement the 
methodology at 45 CFR 400.211 each 
year after receipt of its annual 
appropriation to ensure that 
appropriated funds will be adequate for 
reimbursement to states for the costs of 
assistance to eligible refugees. The 
estimating methodology prescribed in 
the regulations requires the use of actual 
past costs by program component. If the 
methodology indicates that 
appropriated funds are inadequate, ORR 
must take steps to reduce federal 
expenses, such as by limiting the 
number of months of eligibility for 
Refugee Cash Assistance and Refugee 
Medical Assistance. The ORR–2 is a 
single-page financial report that allows 
ORR to collect the necessary data to 
ensure that funds are adequate for the 
projected need and thereby meet the 
requirements of both the Refugee Act 
and ORR regulations. 
Minor changes to the names of certain 
lines on the ORR–2 are proposed to 
align with changes proposed to the 
ORR–1 form in a Federal Register notice 
published on June 24, 2025, at 90 FR 
26819 (https://www.federalregister.gov/ 
d/2025-11546), and approved by OMB 
in August 2025 (https://
www.reginfo.gov/public/do/ 
PRAViewIC?ref_nbr=202506-0970- 018&icID=9799). ORR also proposes 
minor changes to the instructions to 
align with the Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and 
Audit Requirement for Federal Awards 
at 2 CFR part 200.

Administration 
Addition of Duchenne Muscular 
Dystrophy to the Recommended 
Uniform Screening Panel 
AGENCY: Health Resources and Services Administration, Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS). 
ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: HRSA published a Federal Register notice on August 14, 2025 (90 FR 39197), requesting comments from 
the public on the potential 
recommendation of adding Duchenne 
Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) to the 
Recommended Uniform Screening Panel 
(RUSP). After consideration of public 
comments and evidence-based reports, 
HRSA recommended to the HHS 
Secretary that DMD be added to the 
RUSP. The Secretary has accepted the 
recommendation as detailed in this 
notice. Conditions listed on the RUSP 
are part of the evidence-informed 
preventive health guidelines supported 
by HRSA for infants, children, and 
adolescents. Non-grandfathered group 
health plans and health insurance 
issuers are required to cover screenings 
included in these HRSA-supported 
comprehensive guidelines without cost- 
sharing (e.g., copayment, co-insurance, etc.). Please see the RUSP (https://
newbornscreening.hrsa.gov/about- 
newborn-screening/recommended- 
uniform-screening-panel) for additional 
information. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: CDR Leticia Manning, Newborn Screening 
Team Lead, Division of Services for 
Children with Special Health Needs, 
Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 
HRSA, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, 
Maryland 20857 or NBSPrograms@
hrsa.gov. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The RUSP is a list of conditions that the Secretary 
of HHS recommends for states to screen 
as part of their state universal newborn 
screening (NBS) programs. Conditions 
on the RUSP are chosen based on 
evidence that supports the potential net 
benefit of screening, the ability of states 
to screen for the disorder, and the 
availability of effective treatments. 
Although states ultimately determine 
what conditions their NBS program will 
screen for, it is recommended that every 
newborn be screened for all conditions 
on the RUSP. Conditions listed on the 
RUSP are part of the comprehensive 
preventive health guidelines supported 
by HRSA for infants and children under 
section 2713 of the Public Health 
Service Act. Non-grandfathered group 
health plans and health insurance 
issuers are required to cover screenings 
included in these HRSA-supported 
comprehensive guidelines without 
charging a co-payment, co-insurance, or 
deductible for plan years beginning on 
or after the date that is 1 year from the 
Secretary’s adoption of the condition for 
screening. 
The Advisory Committee on Heritable 
Disorders in Newborns and Children 
(ACHDNC), now inactive, was tasked 
with reviewing available scientific 
evidence and then making 
recommendations to the Secretary of 
HHS regarding what conditions should 
be on the RUSP. When a condition was 
nominated, ACHDNC determined 
whether there is sufficient evidence 
available for early screening and refers 
it to the ACHDNC’s Evidence Review 
Group (ERG). The ERG was responsible 
for identifying and assessing all 
available evidence and summarizing for 
ACHDNC the strength and effectiveness 
of the evidence found on the net benefit 
of screening, the ability of states to 
screen for the condition, and the 
availability of effective treatments. The 
ERG completed an evidence review for 
DMD. Following the completion of the 
evidence review for DMD, but prior to 
issuing a recommendation to the 
Secretary on the inclusion of DMD to 
the RUSP, ACHDNC was terminated. 
DMD is a rare genetic condition that 
causes progressive muscle weakness 
and degeneration. Individuals 
eventually require a wheelchair for 
mobility and have a shortened lifespan. 
There are Food and Drug 
Administration-approved treatments 
which allow children to walk longer 
before needing a wheelchair and extend 
heart and lung functions. 
Summary of Public Comments 
A Federal Register notice sought public comment on the potential 
recommendation of including or not 
including DMD on the RUSP. HRSA 
requested that the respondents consider 
the ERG’s report summary on DMD and 
the suitability of state NBS programs 
screening for DMD within the newborn 
period in their response. HRSA 
considered all public comments as part 
of its deliberate process along with 
review of the completed DMD evidence 
review report prior to making a 
recommendation to the Secretary of 
HHS. A total of 379 respondents 
commented on the inclusion of DMD on 
the RUSP. Of these, 366 responses (97 
percent) expressed support to add DMD 
to the RUSP and 11 responses (3 
percent) opposed its addition. The 
responses in support of or against 
adding DMD to the RUSP are 
summarized below. 
Comments on Adding DMD to the RUSP 
Ninety-seven percent of commenters 
(366 comments) were in favor of adding 
DMD to the RUSP. A variety of 
stakeholders, including clinicians and 
families, described benefits and reasons 
in support of adding DMD to the RUSP. 
A vast majority of respondents 
commented that by adding DMD to the 
RUSP, families may receive a DMD 
diagnosis sooner enabling access to 
early intervention, support services, and 
more treatment options. Families 
expressed the invaluable benefit of 
receiving an earlier diagnosis for their 
child to reduce the diagnostic odyssey 
due to an unknown diagnosis through 
progressive symptoms and the negative 
impacts it causes to the family’s overall 
well-being and mental health. Families 
with multiple children shared that 
knowledge of the first child having 
DMD, enabled them to better prepare 
for, identify, and treat subsequent 
children with DMD leading to improved 
health outcomes. Other comments 
emphasized that if DMD is added to the 
RUSP, state adoption to screen for DMD 
will swiftly follow allowing for 
researchers to conduct population-level 
analyses of treatment efficacy. 
Three percent of commenters (11 
comments) were against adding DMD to 
the RUSP. One commenter noted that 
there is a high rate of false positives of 
the screening test which can lead to 
uncertainty/worry before confirmation 
of a negative result and there are unclear 
cutoff thresholds for positive/negative 
results. However, the screening test can 
have additional steps included on the 
same bloodspot prior to confirmatory 
testing, or by implementing DNA 
analysis, that would reduce the false 
positive rate. 
Additional comments highlighted the 
lack of data that supports treatment 
during the newborn period is beneficial 
for the infant. As noted in the evidence- 
based review (https://
publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/ 
doi/10.1542/peds.2025-073192/203177/ 
Evidence-Regarding-Duchenne- 
Muscular- 
Dystrophy?autologincheck=redirected), 
treatment may improve outcomes for 
DMD with additional studies needed to

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with NOTICES59841 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Notices establish the timing of treatment. 
Identification of DMD in an infant 
would allow early monitoring to initiate 
treatment prior to the onset of 
substantial physical decline. 
The final comments against adding 
DMD noted a lack of public health 
laboratory resources to pay for multi-tier 
molecular screening. However, HRSA 
notes that adding a condition to the 
RUSP does not require states to 
implement screening for conditions 
immediately. States determine their 
resource allocations for NBS screening 
based on their specific state budget and 
public health priorities. 
After consideration of the evidence 
review report and public comments, no 
changes were made to the 
recommendation and HRSA 
recommended to the HHS Secretary that 
DMD be included for addition to the 
RUSP. 
Acceptance of Recommendation 
On December 16, 2025, the HHS 
Secretary accepted HRSA’s 
recommendation. The RUSP is updated 
and can be accessed at the following

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Information Collection Request Title: 
Substance Use Disorder Treatment and 
Recovery Loan Repayment Program and 
the Pediatric Specialty Loan Repayment 
Program, OMB No. 0906–0058— 
Revision. 
Abstract: The Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery (STAR) Loan 
Repayment Program (LRP) is authorized 
by section 781 of the Public Health 
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 295h). This 
program allows HRSA to provide the 
repayment of eligible education loans to 
individuals working in an eligible full- 
time substance use disorder treatment 
job that involves direct treatment or 
recovery support of patients with or in 
recovery from a substance use disorder 
and which is located in either a Health 
Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) 
designated for Mental Health, or a 
county (or municipality, if not 
contained within any county) where the 
average drug overdose death rate per 
100,000 people over the past 3 years for 
which official data is available from the 
state, is higher than the most recent 
available national average overdose 
death rate per 100,000 people, as 
reported by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. The Pediatric 
Specialty (PS) LRP is authorized by 
section 775 of the Public Health Service 
Act (42 U.S.C. 295f). This program 
allows HRSA to provide the repayment 
of education loans to eligible providers 
working full-time in or serving a HPSA, 
medically underserved area (MUA), or 
medically underserved population 
(MUP). 
The Department of Health and Human 
Services agrees to make payment of up 
to $250,000 for the repayment of eligible 
educational loans in return for 6 years 
of obligated service through the STAR 
LRP, and up to $100,000 in return for 
3 years of obligated service through the 
PS LRP. 
Eligible disciplines for the STAR LRP 
include, but are not limited to 
physicians, psychologists, psychiatric 
nurses, marriage and family therapists, 
social workers, counselors, and 
substance use disorder counselors. The 
PS LRP may make awards to applicants 
participating in an accredited pediatric 
medical subspecialty, pediatric surgical 
specialty, and child and adolescent 
mental health subspecialty residency or 
fellowship employed as a pediatric 
medical subspecialist, pediatric surgical 
specialist, or child and adolescent 
mental health professional. 
Eligible facilities or sites for the STAR 
LRP and PS LRP include, but are not 
limited to: School-Based Clinics, 
Community Health Centers, Inpatient 
Programs/Rehabilitation Centers, 
Federally Qualified Health Centers, 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services-approved Critical Access 
Hospitals, Rural Emergency Hospitals, 
American Indian Health Facilities 
(Indian Health Service Facilities, 
Tribally-Operated 638 Health Programs, 
and Urban Indian Health Programs), 
inpatient rehabilitation centers, and 
psychiatric facilities. STAR LRP 
facilities must be located in a mental 
health HPSA or a county where the 
average drug overdose death rate 
exceeds the national average, as 
described above. PS LRP sites must 
provide pediatric medical subspecialty 
care, pediatric surgical specialty care, or 
child and adolescent mental and 
behavioral health care in or to a HPSA, 
MUA, or MUP. HRSA will approve and 
activate sites for the PS LRP if: 
(1) The facility is already approved for 
the National Health Service Corps, 
Nurse Corps, or STAR LRP and located 
in or serves a HPSA, MUA or MUP; or 
(2) During the PS LRP application 
cycle, the facility submits to HRSA the 
site type and the point of contact(s) to 
PS_LRP_Sites@hrsa.gov. HRSA will review and approve 
eligible new facilities during the 
respective application cycle for the 
STAR LRP and the PS LRP, or upon 
request by a STAR LRP participant. New 
facilities must submit to HRSA the 
facility type and the recruitment 
contact(s). HRSA will use the 
information collected to determine 
eligibility of the facility for participants 
in the respective program. 
Note: Despite the similarity in the titles, the STAR LRP is not the existing National 
Health Service Corps Substance Use Disorder 
Workforce LRP (OMB #0915–0127), which is 
authorized under Title III of the Public 
Health Service Act. The STAR LRP is 
authorized under Title VII of the Public

HRSA’s response: 
€The commenter expressed concern with data captured in the PS LRP’s 
application and the employment 
verification forms regarding their 
alignment with current program 
guidance and statutory requirements. 
€The commenter also expressed support for the STAR/PS LRP 
application and employment 
verification forms as well as provided 
ways in which to streamline the 
application submission to ensure 
maximum benefit for eligible applicants. 
HRSA acknowledges the concerns and 
recommendations in the comment and 
will consider them, as appropriate, in 
the development of information 
collection activities for these programs. 
HRSA responded directly to the 
stakeholder who submitted the 
comments, acknowledging the 
recommendations raised. HRSA 
appreciates the views shared and the 
willingness to support the PS LRP and 
STAR LRP. 
Need and Proposed Use of the 
Information: The need and purpose of this information collection is to obtain 
information that is used to assess an 
applicant’s eligibility and qualifications 
for the STAR LRP and the PS LRP, and 
to obtain information for eligible 
facilities or sites. Clinicians interested 
in participating in the STAR LRP or the 
PS LRP must apply to the applicable 
program to participate. The forms 
utilized by the STAR LRP and the PS 
LRP include the following: the STAR 
LRP or PS LRP Application, 
respectively, the Authorization for 
Disclosure of Loan Information form, 
the Privacy Act Release Authorization 
form, and the electronic Employment 
Verification form, if applicable. The 
forms collect information needed for 
selecting participants and repaying 
eligible educational loans. 
Additionally, health care facilities 
located in high overdose death rate 
areas or mental health HPSAs must 
submit the facility type and the site 
point(s) of contact for HRSA to 
determine the facility’s eligibility to 
participate in the STAR LRP. Similarly, 
sites located in or serving a HPSA, 
MUA, or MUP must submit the site type 
and the site point(s) of contact for HRSA 
to determine the sites’ eligibility to 
participate in the PS LRP. The STAR 
LRP and the PS LRP application ask for 
personal, professional, and financial 
information needed to determine the 
applicant’s eligibility to participate in 
either of the programs. In addition, 
applicants must provide information 
regarding the loans for which repayment 
is being requested. 
Likely Respondents: Licensed 
medical, mental, and behavioral health 
providers who are employed or seeking 
employment and are interested in 
serving underserved populations; and 
health care facilities or sites interested 
in becoming approved for the STAR 
LRP and/or the PS LRP. 
Burden Statement: Burden in this 
context means the time expended by 
persons to generate, maintain, retain, 
disclose, or provide the information 
requested. This includes the time 
needed to review instructions; to 
develop, acquire, install, and utilize

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Information Collection Request Title: 
Rural Communities Opioid Response 
Program Performance Measures, OMB 
No. 0906–0044—Revision. 
Abstract: HRSA administers the Rural Communities Opioid Response Program 
(RCORP), which is authorized by 
Section 711(b)(5) of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 912(b)(5)) and is a multi- 
initiative program that aims to: (1) 
support treatment for and prevention of 
substance use disorder (SUD), including 
opioid use disorder (OUD); and (2) 
reduce morbidity and mortality 
associated with SUD, including OUD, 
by improving access to and delivering 
prevention, treatment, and recovery 
support services to high-risk rural 
communities. To support this purpose, 
RCORP grant initiatives include: 
€RCORP-Implementation grants, which fund established networks and 
consortia to deliver SUD/OUD 
prevention, treatment, and recovery 
activities in high-risk rural 
communities; 
€RCORP-Psychostimulant Support grants, which aim to strengthen and 
expand access to prevention, treatment, 
and recovery services for individuals in 
rural areas who misuse 
psychostimulants, to enhance their 
ability to access treatment and move 
toward recovery; 
€RCORP-Medication Assisted Treatment Access grants, which aim to 
establish new access points in rural 
facilities where none currently exist; 
€RCORP-Behavioral Health Care support grants, which aim to expand 
access to and quality of behavioral 
health care services at the individual, 
provider, and community levels; 
€RCORP Overdose Response recipients address immediate needs in 
rural areas through improving access to, 
capacity for, and sustainability of 
prevention, treatment, and recovery 
services for SUD; 
€RCORP Child and Adolescent Behavioral Health grants, which aim to 
establish and expand sustainable 
behavioral health care services for 
children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 
years who live in rural communities; 
€RCORP-Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome grants, which aim to reduce 
the incidence and impact of Neonatal 
Abstinence Syndrome in rural 
communities and 
€RCORP-Impact recipients aim to improve access to integrated, 
coordinated treatment and recovery 
services for SUD, including OUD, in 
rural areas. 
€Note that additional grant initiatives may be added pending fiscal 
year 2026 and future fiscal year 
appropriations. 
HRSA currently collects information 
about RCORP grants using approved 
performance measures. HRSA 
developed separate performance 
measures for the new RCORP-Impact 
program and seeks OMB approval for 
the new collection.

Need and Proposed Use of the 
Information: Due to the growth in the number of grant initiatives included 
within RCORP, as well as emerging SUD 
and other behavioral health trends in 
rural communities, HRSA is submitting 
a revised ICR that includes measures for 
the new RCORP-Impact grant program. 
HRSA developed performance measures 
to provide data on each RCORP 
initiative and to enable HRSA to 
provide aggregate program data required 
by Congress under the Government 
Performance and Results Act of 1993. 
These measures cover the principal 
topic areas of interest to HRSA, 
including: (a) provision of, and referral 
to, rural behavioral health care services, 
including SUD prevention, treatment 
and recovery support services; (b) 
behavioral health care, including SUD 
prevention, treatment, and recovery, 
process and outcomes; (c) provider 
prevention, treatment, and recovery 
services; and (d) sustainability. 
Performance measures for the RCORP 
initiative include common elements 
about consortium/network activities, 
direct services provided and service 
access, workforce, and sustainability 
while also capturing tailored measures 
for each specific program. 
Likely Respondents: The respondents 
will be the recipients of the RCORP 
grants. 
Burden Statement: Burden in this 
context means the time expended by 
persons to generate, maintain, retain, 
disclose, or provide the information 
requested. This includes the time 
needed to review instructions; to 
develop, acquire, install, and utilize 
technology and systems for the purpose 
of collecting, validating, and verifying 
information, processing and 
maintaining information, and disclosing 
and providing information; to train 
personnel and to be able to respond to 
a collection of information; to search 
data sources; to complete and review 
the collection of information; and to 
transmit or otherwise disclose the 
information. The total annual burden 
hours estimated for this ICR are 
summarized in the table below.

Information Collection Request Title: 
The Maternal, Infant, and Early 
Childhood Home Visiting Program 
Performance Measurement Information 
System, OMB No. 0915–0017— 
Revision. 
Abstract: This request is for continued approval of the Maternal, Infant, and 
Early Childhood Home Visiting 
(MIECHV) Program Performance 
Measurement Information System. The 
MIECHV Program is administered by the 
Maternal and Child Health Bureau 
within HRSA in partnership with the 
Administration for Children and 
Families, and provides support to all 56 
states and jurisdictions, as well as tribes 
and tribal organizations. Through a 
needs assessment, states, jurisdictions, 
tribes, and tribal organizations identify 
target populations and select the home 
visiting service delivery model(s) that 
best meet their needs. State and 
jurisdiction MIECHV funding recipients 
report annual demographic and 
performance data to HRSA through 
Form 1—Demographic Performance 
Measures and Form 2—Benchmark 
Performance Measures. MIECHV 
funding recipients also report program 
information on a quarterly basis through 
Form 4—Quarterly Data Collection 
(Currently approved under OMB No. 
0906–0016). This ICR will now include 
Forms 1, 2, and 4, so all the components 
of data collection for the MIECHV 
Program in one request. OMB No. 0906– 
0016 will be discontinued after OMB 
approval of this ICR. 
HRSA is revising the data collection 
forms for the MIECHV Program to 
reduce administrative burden where 
possible and to increase alignment with 
current clinical guidelines, evidence- 
based guidelines, and performance 
measures of other maternal and child 
health programs. HRSA proposes the 
following changes: 
€Form 1 cross-cutting changes: ÆRemove new and continuing participant categories from Tables 4, 5, 
18, 19, and 20. 
ÆRemove pregnant participant and caregiver categories for Table 9, 10, 11, 
and 18. 
ÆAdd Section D: Place Based Services to collect, on an annual basis, 
information previously reported 
quarterly on Form 4. 
ÆRenumber tables as appropriate per other changes. 
€Form 1, Tables 1 and 2: Combine Tables 1 and 2 into one table that 
captures new and continuing 
participants and households together. 
€Form 1, Table 4: Decrease the number of response categories for age of 
adult participants from 10 to 6. 
€Form 1, Tables 6 and 7: Update response categories to align with OMB’s 
Statistical Policy Directive 15: 
Standards for Maintaining, Collecting 
and Presenting Federal Data on Race 
and Ethnicity. 
€Form 1, Table 8: Remove this table from the data collection form.

€Form 4, Table A3: Remove this table from data collection. 
€Forms 1, 2, and 4: Update Definition of Key Terms to reflect the 
changes. 
Need and Proposed Use of the 
Information: HRSA uses performance information to demonstrate program 
accountability and continuously 
monitor and provide oversight to 
MIECHV Program awardees. The 
information is also used to provide 
quality improvement guidance and 
technical assistance to awardees and 
help inform the development of early 
childhood systems at the national, state, 
and local level. HRSA is seeking to 
revise and extend collection of (1) 
demographic, service utilization, and 
select clinical indicators for participants 
enrolled in home visiting services, and 
location of services (annually via Form 
1); (2) a set of standardized performance 
and outcome indicators that correspond 
with the statutorily identified 
benchmark areas (annually via Form 2); 
and (3) home visiting program capacity 
and staffing data (quarterly via Form 4). 
This information will be used to 
demonstrate awardees’ compliance with 
legislative and programmatic 
requirements. It will also be used to 
monitor and provide continued 
oversight of awardee performance and 
target technical assistance resources for 
awardees. Revisions to the forms meet a 
statutory requirement to reduce 
administrative burden for MIECHV 
funding recipients (Section 511(h)(6)(A) 
of the Social Security Act). HRSA 
reviewed the information collected and 
streamlined, where possible, to collect 
the optimum amount of data necessary 
to fulfill awardee performance 
measurement and demonstration of 
improvement requirements. 
Additionally, other revisions have been 
made to align performance measures 
with other maternal and child health 
programs, with current Statistical Policy 
Directive 15 (Standards for Maintaining, 
Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data 
on Race and Ethnicity), and current 
clinical and evidence-based guidelines. 
The revisions reflect feedback from 
current MIECHV funding recipients, 
home visiting model developers, and 
federal partners. 
Likely Respondents: MIECHV Program 
funding recipients that are states, 
jurisdictions, and, where applicable, 
nonprofit organizations providing home 
visiting services within states. 
Burden Statement: Burden in this 
context means the time expended by 
persons to generate, maintain, retain, 
disclose, or provide the information 
requested. This includes the time 
needed to review instructions; to 
develop, acquire, install, and utilize 
technology and systems for the purpose 
of collecting, validating, and verifying 
information, processing and 
maintaining information, and disclosing

personnel and to be able to respond to 
a collection of information; to search 
data sources; to complete and review 
the collection of information; and to 
transmit or otherwise disclose the 
information. The total annual burden 
hours estimated for this ICR are 
summarized in the table below. 
HRSA updated the estimated burden 
hours based on data collected in 
summer 2024 under OMB No. 0906– 
0094, titled ‘‘Implement MIECHV 
Program 2022 Legislative Changes:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Information Collection Request Title: 
Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) 
Initiative in the U.S. Triannual Report 
OMB No. 0906–0051—Revision. 
Abstract: HRSA’s Ryan White HIV/ AIDS Program (RWHAP) funds and 
coordinates with cities, states, counties, 
and local clinics to deliver efficient and 
effective HIV care, treatment, and 
support services to low-income people 
with HIV. Since 1990, the RWHAP has 
developed a comprehensive system of 
providers who deliver high quality 
direct health care and support services 
to over half a million people with HIV— 
more than 50 percent of all people with 
diagnosed HIV in the United States. 
Nearly two-thirds of clients live at or 
below 100 percent of the Federal 
Poverty Level.
1
 
The federal Ending the HIV Epidemic 
in the U.S. (EHE) initiative focuses on 
reducing the number of new HIV 
infections in the United States.
2
 
Authorized by section 311(c) and title 
XXVI of the Public Health Service Act, 
this initiative began in fiscal year 2020 
and focuses on 48 counties, 
Washington, DC; San Juan, Puerto Rico; 
as well as seven states that have a 
substantial number of HIV diagnoses in 
rural areas. The EHE initiative efforts 
focus on the following four key 
strategies that together can end the HIV 
epidemic in the United States: 
1. Diagnose all people with HIV as early as possible. 
2. Treat people with HIV rapidly and effectively to reach sustained viral 
suppression. 
3. Prevent new HIV transmissions by using proven interventions. 
4. Respond quickly to potential HIV outbreaks to get needed prevention and 
treatment services to people who need 
them. 
The EHE initiative is a collaborative 
effort among key Department of Health 
and Human Services agencies, primarily 
HRSA, the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, the National Institutes 
of Health, the Indian Health Service, 
and the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration. 
Through HRSA’s RWHAP and Health 
Center Program, the agency has a 
leading role in helping diagnose, treat, 
prevent, and respond to end the HIV 
epidemic in the United States. 
In June 2025, HRSA awarded more 
than $146 million to 49 EHE recipients 
to continue the efforts of the EHE 
initiative. This funding helps states and 
metropolitan areas with the highest 
levels of HIV transmission link people 
with HIV who are either newly 
diagnosed, or are diagnosed but 
currently not in care, to essential HIV 
care to continue the efforts of the EHE 
initiative. This funding helps states and 
metropolitan areas with the highest 
levels of HIV transmission link people 
with HIV who are either newly 
diagnosed, or are diagnosed but 
currently not in care, to essential HIV 
care, treatment and support services, as 
well as to provide workforce training, 
technical assistance, and support 
services. HRSA is making one minor 
revision to a footnote to clarify an 
existing instruction. There are no other 
changes to the collection. 
A 60-day notice published in the 
Federal Register on August 5, 2025, vol. 
90, No. 148; pp. 37528–29. There were 
no public comments. 
Need and Proposed Use of the 
Information: To support federal requirements to monitor and report on 
funds distributed through the EHE 
initiative, HRSA created a reporting 
module, the EHE Triannual Report, 
which is an aggregate data report 
submitted three times a year by EHE 
recipients and providers of services. 
EHE-funded providers will report 
aggregate information on the number of 
clients receiving specific services and 
the number of clients who were 
prescribed antiretroviral medications in 
the four-month reporting period. This 
module provides HRSA with frequent 
and timely data on EHE initiative 
progress by providing information on 
the number of clients who are reached 
through the EHE initiative. This will 
provide valuable information on the 
scope of outreach to new clients and 
clients who have had a lapse in service, 
which could be an indication of 
reengagement in care. This module will 
support project officer monitoring and 
HRSA’s understanding of service 
provision. Finally, the information 
collected in the EHE Triannual Report 
will complement the annual 
information collected through the 
RWHAP Services Report and other 
reporting mechanisms and support 
HRSA to monitor EHE initiative 
activities and assess progress toward 
meeting national goals for ending the 
HIV epidemic. 
Likely Respondents: RWHAP Part A 
and Part B recipients and subrecipients 
funded by the EHE initiative. 
Burden Statement: Burden in this 
context means the time expended by 
persons to generate, maintain, retain, 
disclose, or provide the information 
requested. This includes the time 
needed to review instructions; to 
develop, acquire, install, and utilize 
technology and systems for the purpose 
of collecting, validating, and verifying

Addition of Metachromatic 
Leukodystrophy to the Recommended 
Uniform Screening Panel 
AGENCY: Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Department of 
Health and Human Services. 
ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) 
published a Federal Register notice on 
August 14, 2025 (90 FR 39196), 
requesting comments from the public on 
the potential recommendation of adding 
Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) 
to the Recommended Uniform 
Screening Panel (RUSP). After 
consideration of public comments and 
evidence-based reports, HRSA 
recommended to the Secretary of Health 
and Human Services (HHS) that MLD be 
added to the RUSP. The Secretary of 
HHS has accepted the recommendation 
as detailed in this notice. Conditions 
listed on the RUSP are part of the 
evidence-informed preventive health 
guidelines supported by HRSA for 
infants, children, and adolescents. Non- 
grandfathered group health plans and 
group health insurance issuers are 
required to cover screenings included in 
these HRSA-supported comprehensive 
guidelines without cost-sharing (e.g., 
copayment, co-insurance, etc.). Please 
see the RUSP (https://
newbornscreening.hrsa.gov/about- 
newborn-screening/recommended- 
uniform-screening-panel) for additional 
information. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: CDR Leticia Manning, Newborn Screening 
Team Lead, Division of Services for 
Children with Special Health Needs, 
Maternal and Child Health Bureau, 
HRSA, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, 
Maryland 20857 or NBSPrograms@
hrsa.gov. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The RUSP is a list of conditions that the Secretary 
of HHS recommends for states to screen 
as part of their state universal newborn 
screening (NBS) programs. Conditions 
on the RUSP are chosen based on 
evidence that supports the potential net 
benefit of screening, the ability of states 
to screen for the disorder, and the 
availability of effective treatments. 
Although states ultimately determine 
what conditions their NBS program will 
screen for, it is recommended that every 
newborn be screened for all conditions 
on the RUSP. Conditions listed on the 
RUSP are part of the comprehensive 
preventive health guidelines supported 
by HRSA for infants, children, and 
adolescents under section 2713 of the 
Public Health Service Act. Non- 
grandfathered group health plans and 
health insurance issuers are required to 
cover screenings included in these 
HRSA-supported comprehensive 
guidelines without charging a co- 
payment, co-insurance, or deductible for 
plan years beginning on or after the date 
that is one year from the Secretary’s 
adoption of the condition for screening. 
The Advisory Committee on Heritable 
Disorders in Newborns and Children 
(ACHDNC), now inactive, was tasked 
with reviewing available scientific 
evidence and then making 
recommendations to the Secretary of 
HHS regarding what conditions should 
be on the RUSP. When a condition is 
nominated, ACHDNC determines 
whether there is sufficient evidence 
available for early screening and refers 
it to ACHDNC’s Evidence Review Group 
(ERG). The ERG is responsible for 
identifying and assessing all available 
evidence and summarizing for ACHDNC 
the strength and effectiveness of the 
evidence found on the net benefit of 
screening, the ability of states to screen 
for the condition, and the availability of 
effective treatments. The ERG 
completed an evidence review for MLD. 
Following the completion of the 
evidence review for MLD, but prior to 
issuing a recommendation to the 
Secretary on the inclusion of MLD to the 
RUSP, the ACHDNC was terminated. 
The condition for addition, MLD, is a 
rare genetic condition that leads to 
progressive motor and brain damage. 
Children with early-onset forms of the 
condition who do not receive treatment 
before symptom onset experience motor 
function loss/paralysis and neurological 
impairment followed by death at 5–6 
years of age. Gene therapy is extremely 
effective if started early in life, with 
those who were placed on the earliest 
treatment pilots continuing to live into 
their mid-teen years today. 
Summary of Public Comments 
A Federal Register notice sought public comment on the potential 
recommendation of including or not 
including MLD on the RUSP. HRSA 
requested that the respondents consider 
the ERG’s report summary on MLD and 
the suitability of state NBS programs 
screening for MLD within the newborn 
period in their response. HRSA 
considered all public comments as part 
of its deliberative process along with 
review of the completed MLD evidence 
review report prior to making a 
recommendation to the Secretary of 
HHS. A total of 98 respondents 
commented on the inclusion of MLD on 
the RUSP. Of these, 96 responses (98 
percent) expressed support to add MLD 
to the RUSP, 1 response (1 percent) 
opposed its addition, and 1 response (1 
percent) provided feedback on awaiting 
results from pilot studies and early 
adopting states to inform 
implementation. The responses in 
support of or against adding MLD to the 
RUSP are summarized below. 
Comments on Adding MLD to the RUSP 
The majority of respondents (96 
responses or 98 percent) described 
benefits of adding MLD to the RUSP 
including highly accurate screening for 
MLD with minimal false positives, if 
any; an FDA-approved gene therapy 
proven to prevent symptoms if 
administered before onset of disease; 
and early diagnosis can save lives of 
children with MLD.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Foundations for Evidence-Based 
Policymaking Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115– 
435), or the Evidence Act, promotes the 
use of evidence to inform decision- 
making and requires federal agencies to 
undertake activities toward this end. 
Specifically, the Evidence Act requires 
agencies to develop Learning Agendas 
and Annual Evaluation Plans. 
CISA’s Learning Agenda questions are 
documented in the Department of 
Homeland Security FY 2022–2026 
Learning Agenda. In addition, its 
evaluations are included in the 
Department’s Annual Evaluation Plans, 
indicating that the Department has 
recognized those evaluations as 
‘‘significant.’’ The Stakeholder 
Engagement Division (SED) Convenings 
Evaluation is one such significant 
evaluation and was included in the 
Department of Homeland Security FY 
2023 Annual Evaluation Plan. CISA’s 
PA&E Division (and any contractors, as 
applicable) is conducting this study. 
SED Convenings Evaluation 
CISA SED leads CISA’s national and 
international voluntary partnerships 
and engagements with critical 
infrastructure stakeholders while 
serving as the agency’s hub for the 
shared stakeholder information that 
unifies CISA’s approach to whole-of- 
nation operational collaboration and 
information sharing. CISA’s voluntary 
partnership model relies on constant 
feedback and collaboration with critical 
infrastructure partners. One mechanism 
to seek this input is through the various 
convening activities, including 
Councils, Boards, and Committees, that 
CISA manages through SED. These 
convening mechanisms provide 
structure and an iterative process for 
bringing government, industry, and 
academic partners together to drive 
whole-of-nation operational 
collaboration. Other products and 
services offered to partners include 
analysis, reports, guidance, trainings, 
and scenario-based drills developed to 
help the entire community do their part 
to raise the security baseline of critical 
infrastructure’s assets, systems, and 
networks. 
This SED Convenings Evaluation will 
assess the extent to which CISA’s 
convening activities, products, and 
services (1) provide timely, accurate, 
and useful information about security 
and risk resilience, including 
opportunities for meaningful 
information exchange between CISA 
and sector stakeholders; and (2) are 
accessed and used by stakeholders to 
enhance their abilities to respond to 
critical threats and improve strategic 
decision-making and risk reduction. 
This study also aims to increase 
understanding of the best practices for 
getting stakeholders engaged and 
building trusted relationships. 
This is a new information collection. 
Information will be collected by CISA 
PA&E (and any contractors, as 
applicable). The potential respondent 
universe for this evaluation includes 
individual representatives 
(approximately 1,000 cyber and 
physical security, emergency, and 
business continuity managers) of 
approximately 300 member 
organizations from three critical 
infrastructure sectors [Critical 
Manufacturing, Commercial Facilities, 
and Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and 
Waste (herein referred to as ‘‘Nuclear’’)]. 
Those who have served as a 
representative for less than 3 months 
will be excluded. 
The burden for respondents will be 
minimized by restricting the survey and 
interview length, by conducting 
interviews at times convenient for 
respondents, and by not requiring 
record-keeping or written responses on 
the part of the respondents. Some 
member organizations may be small 
businesses. The evaluation team will 
only request information required for 
the purposes of the evaluation. 
Surveys. The survey will be created and sent using Qualtrics, a professional- 
grade survey software, in order to 
minimize burden. Using the email 
addresses of the representatives 
provided by the SED sector chiefs, the 
study team will send a link that 
participants can use to access and 
complete the survey using a tablet, 
smartphone, or laptop. Electronic 
submission will ensure the maximum 
response rate while also permitting 
respondents to complete the survey at a 
time of their own choosing. 
The survey will ask questions about 
the representatives’ member 
organization (size and type); their 
satisfaction with CISA’s convening 
activities, products, and services; the 
types of organizational changes made as 
a result of CISA’s convening activities, 
products, and services; representatives’ 
suggestions for improvement of CISA’s 
convening activities, products, and 
services; and perceived quality of

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with NOTICES59852 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Notices relationships and engagements with 
CISA. The survey is designed so that 
each sector has a customized link with 
specific questions for that sector to 
account for some minor differences in 
the convenings, products, and services 
that each sector provides. This will help 
ensure that the members of each sector 
are asked questions that are most 
relevant to them. 
Interviews. The study team will also conduct a series of virtual interviews 
with up to 75 participants who 
complete the online survey and agree to 
participate in the interview. The study 
team plans to conduct the in-depth 
interviews by telephone or via a web- 
based conference call platform, such as 
Microsoft Teams. This format should be 
less burdensome to study participants 
than in-person interviews since they do 
not have to host study team members. 
The interviews will ask more in-depth 
information about representatives’ 
reasons for satisfaction or dissatisfaction 
with CISA’s convening activities, 
products, and services; types of 
organizational changes made as a result 
of CISA’s convening activities, products, 
and services; and the quality of 
relationships with CISA. 
Without collecting this information, 
CISA will not meet the requirements of 
the Evidence Act to conduct program 
evaluations—particularly, this SED 
Convenings Evaluation, which was 
included in the Department of 
Homeland Security FY 2023 Annual 
Evaluation Plan as a ‘‘significant’’ 
evaluation. In addition, without 
collecting this information, SED, other 
CISA stakeholder engagement programs, 
and CISA-at-large will not be able to 
understand whether and how CISA’s 
convening activities, products, and 
services provide value and utility for 
stakeholders to enhance their decision- 
making and risk reduction. Thus, CISA 
will not have the information needed to 
learn how to improve the planning, 
execution, and delivery of the 
convenings, products, and services so 
that they are more meaningful, relevant, 
timely, and actionable for stakeholders. 
Without collecting this information, 
CISA will also not be able to assess how 
to best engage and build trusted 
relationships with stakeholders, which 
is needed to identify areas for 
improvement in how CISA collaborates 
and interacts with stakeholders to 
support information exchange within 
and across sectors.

Abstract: The National Land Remote Sensing Education, Outreach and 
Research Activity is an effort that 
involves the development of a U.S. 
national consortium in building the 
capability to receive, process and 
archive remotely sensed data. The 
purposes are to provide university and 
State organizations with access to data 
in a ready-to-use format and to expand 
the science of remote sensing through 
education, research, applications 
development, and outreach in areas 
such as water availability (or lack 
thereof), phenology, natural resource 
management and disaster analysis. 
Respondents submit proposals to 
acquire funding for a national (U.S.) 
program to promote the uses of space- 
based land remote sensing data and 
technologies through education and 
outreach at the State and local level and 
through university-based and 
collaborative research projects. The 
information collected will ensure that 
sufficient and relevant information is 
available to evaluate and select a 
proposal for funding. A panel of USGS 
Core Science Systems Mission Area 
managers and scientists will review 
each proposal to evaluate the technical 
merit, requirements, and priorities 
identified in the call for proposals. 
This notice concerns the collection of 
information that is sufficient and 
relevant to evaluate and select proposals 
for funding. We will protect information 
from respondents considered 
proprietary under the Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), its 
implementing regulations (43 CFR part 
2), and 30 CFR 250.197, ‘‘Data and 
information to be made available to the 
public or for limited inspection.’’ 
Responses are voluntary. No questions 
of a ‘‘sensitive’’ nature are asked. We 
intend to release the project abstracts 
and primary investigators for awarded/ 
funded projects only.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 14, 2024, the BLM published 
proposed NTL–5, ‘‘Clarifying the 
Implementation of Certain BLM Oil and 
Gas Measurement Regulations’’ (89 FR 
90037). Proposed NTL–5 would have 
clarified when and how operators are 
expected to comply with certain 
requirements in the oil and gas 
measurement regulations in 43 CFR part 
3170, which became effective in January 
2017. The BLM issued the proposed 
NTL–5 pursuant to 43 CFR 3164.2, 
which authorizes the BLM to issue 
notices to lessees when necessary to 
implement the BLM’s oil and gas 
regulations. 
However, in compliance with 
Executive Order 14154, ‘‘Unleashing 
American Energy,’’ which directs 
Federal agencies to identify any rules or 
other actions that ‘‘impose an undue 
burden on the identification, 
development, or use of domestic energy 
resources,’’ and in compliance with 
additional direction from the Secretary 
of the Interior, the BLM has 
reconsidered the proposed notice and 
now declines to publish a final version 
of NTL–5. This withdrawal decision is 
being issued to reduce compliance 
burdens for operators.

Abstract of Information Available 
A total of 175 cultural items have 
been requested for repatriation. The 175 
catalog numbers representing objects of 
cultural patrimony are ecofacts (faunal 
bone), flaked stone, and miscellaneous 
lithics. CA–KER–3558 and CA–KER– 
3559 are located in Kern County, 
California, near State Route 58. The 
collection is the result of the 1993 
Archaeological Testing and Evaluation 
of CA–KER–3558 and CA–KER–3559, 
Fremont Valley, for the Proposed 
Mojave Bypass Project (EA 243400). The 
collection is controlled by Caltrans and 
curated at The University of California, 
Riverside (UCR), as Accession #225. The 
initial catalog recorded 76 catalog 
numbers, while the 2025 catalog 
verification confirmed 175 catalog 
numbers, all of which are present. Based 
on the information available and the 
results of consultation, cultural 
affiliation is clearly identified by the 
information available about the objects 
of cultural patrimony described in this 
notice. There are no known/ 
documented potentially hazardous 
substances used to treat any of the 
cultural items. 
Determinations 
The Caltrans has determined that: 
€The 175 objects of cultural patrimony described in this notice have 
ongoing historical, traditional, or 
cultural importance central to the

Abstract of Information Available 
A total of nine sets of cultural items 
have been requested for repatriation. A 
total of eight of the sets of items are 
objects of cultural patrimony and one is 
an unassociated funerary object. 
The objects of cultural patrimony are: 
items purchased from Paul J. Warner of 
Chicago, Illinois: a string of wampum 
(1954.1676) and three brooches worn 
and used by John W. Quinney collected 
in Stockbridge, Wisconsin (1954.1677, 
a–b). A beaded pouch made by a 
Stockbridge woman, c. 1843, and 
donated through the Rosellette Bird 
estate (1954.1680). Four sets of items 
from Austin Quinney of Stockbridge, 
Wisconsin donated through the Harriet 
B. Quinney estate: a firemaking set 
(1954.1699, A–B, D), a fiber and buffalo 
bag (1954.2048), and two sets of two 
garters (1954.2052, A and 1954.2053, a). 
Lastly, a wampum bead collected in 
Outagamie County by William F. Wolf 
(1975.287.6). 
The one unassociated funerary object 
is a stone pendant (1955.1341) removed 
from a burial mound at Dorn’s Landing 
in Calumet County, Wisconsin by the 
donor of the pendant—Orrin 
Thompson—in 1844. WHS has no 
documentation indicating that human 
remains were removed from the mound 
by the donor. 
Determinations 
WHS has determined that: 
€The one unassociated funerary objects described in this notice are 
reasonably believed to have been placed 
intentionally with or near human 
remains, and are connected, either at the 
time of death or later as part of the death 
rite or ceremony of a Native American 
culture according to the Native 
American traditional knowledge of a 
lineal descendant, Indian Tribe, or 
Native Hawaiian organization. The 
unassociated funerary objects have been 
identified by a preponderance of the 
evidence as related to human remains, 
specific individuals, or families, or 
removed from a specific burial site or 
burial area of an individual or 
individuals with cultural affiliation to 
an Indian Tribe or Native Hawaiian 
organization. 
€The eight sets of objects of cultural patrimony described in this notice have 
ongoing historical, traditional, or 
cultural importance central to the 
Native American group, including any

Abstract of Information Available 
Site 40SL34, Sullivan County, TN 
Human remains representing, at least, 
14 individuals have been identified. The 
10 associated funerary objects are two 
lithic bifaces, one notched freshwater 
bivalve shell, five lots of artifacts 
including fauna, one lot of shell beads, 
and one lot of unsorted materials. These 
Ancestors and cultural items were 
recovered from Eastman Rock Shelter, a 
Late Archaic to Mississippian site, 
between July 1979 to October 1980 by 
S.D. Dean. This project was done in 
collaboration with Charles Faulkner 
(UTK) and TDOT. It is unknown when 
the Ancestors and cultural items were 
transferred to UTK, but based on past 
practices, this transfer was likely 
instigated by Faulkner. The Ancestors 
and some cultural items were then 
transferred to ETSU by staff prior to 
2018. Later, these Ancestors and some 
cultural items were transferred to 
TDEC–DOA for repatriation. There is no 
known exposure to hazardous 
substances or treatments.

Alaska Outer Continental Shelf, Cook 
Inlet Planning Area, Oil and Gas Lease 
Sale 258 
AGENCY: Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Interior. 
ACTION: Notice of availability; record of decision. 
SUMMARY: The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) announces the 
availability of the modified record of 
decision (ROD) for the Cook Inlet Outer 
Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas 
Lease Sale 258. The ROD identifies the 
selected alternative for Lease Sale 258, 
which was analyzed in the ‘‘Alaska 
Outer Continental Shelf, Cook Inlet 
Planning Area, Oil and Gas Lease Sale 
258 in the Cook Inlet, Alaska, Final 
Supplemental Environmental Impact 
Statement’’ (OCS EIS/EA BOEM 2025– 
035) (EIS). BOEM prepared the 
supplemental EIS to address 
deficiencies identified by the U.S. 
District Court for the District of Alaska 
(Court) in its opinion of July 16, 2024, 
and to inform the decision maker on 
whether to affirm, modify, or void Lease 
Sale 258. In making her decision, the 
Assistant Secretary for Land and 
Minerals Management (ASLM) 
considered nine alternatives, several 
sub-alternatives, and their potential 
impacts in the supplemental EIS. After 
careful consideration, the ASLM 
selected alternative 6, described in the 
supplemental EIS as the preferred 
alternative, which affirmed Lease Sale 
258 as it was held in 2022 and the one 
lease issued from that lease sale. 
ADDRESSES: The modified ROD and associated information are available on 
BOEM’s website at https://
www.boem.gov/ak258.

3801 Centerpoint Drive, Suite 500, 
Anchorage, Alaska 99503, 907–312– 
3788, casey.rowe@boem.gov. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The potential environmental effects of oil 
and gas activities that could result from 
Lease Sale (LS) 258 were originally 
evaluated in the ‘‘Alaska Outer 
Continental Shelf, Cook Inlet Planning 
Area, Oil and Gas Lease Sale 258 in the 
Cook Inlet, Alaska, Final Environmental 
Impact Statement’’ (EIS) (OCS/EIS EA 
BOEM 2022–061) (2022 Final EIS). The 
Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, 
Lands and Mineral Management, signed 
the ROD on November 26, 2022. LS 258 
was held on December 30, 2022, 
resulting in one lease issued. The sale 
was required to be held no later than 
December 31, 2022, by the Inflation 
Reduction Act (Pub. L. 119–61). 
On December 21, 2022, plaintiffs 
Cook Inletkeeper and others filed a 
lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the 
District of Alaska under the 
Administrative Procedure Act, alleging 
several violations of the National 
Environmental Policy Act. On July 16, 
2024, the Court ruled partially in favor 
of the plaintiffs and remanded without 
vacatur the LS 258 EIS and ROD to 
BOEM to prepare a supplemental EIS to 
address three deficiencies identified by 
the Court. 
On April 4, 2025, BOEM published a 
notice of intent (NOI) to prepare the LS 
258 supplemental EIS (90 FR 14866). 
The supplemental EIS, completed in 
December 2025, considered nine 
alternatives and several sub-alternatives. 
The ASLM selected alternative 6 and 
affirmed LS 258 and the one lease 
issued as a result of the sale. As 
described in the modified ROD, the 
ASLM fully considered the potential 
impacts of this action as described in 
the supplemental EIS, considered 
mitigation of potential impacts through 
exclusion of sensitive OCS areas and 
implementation of lease stipulations, 
and articulated factors considered in 
selecting the agency’s preferred 
alternative. In making the decision, the 
ASLM confirmed the previously 
adopted lease stipulations as being the 
most practicable means at the lease sale 
stage of reducing or avoiding impacts to 
the environment. She also noted that the 
OCS Lands Act provides BOEM and

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with NOTICES59865 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Notices BSEE with broad discretion to require 
additional mitigation measures for post- 
lease activities. 
In affirming LS 258 and preserving 
the opportunity to explore and possibly 
develop the resultant lease, the ASLM’s 
decision balances the national policies 
mandated by Congress to expeditiously 
and safely develop the natural resources 
of the OCS, subject to environmental 
safeguards, in a manner that is 
consistent with the maintenance of 
competition and other national needs. 
The ASLM’s selection of alternative 6 
and adoption of all practicable 
mitigation measures at the lease sale 
stage balances the goal of orderly 
resource development with protection 
of the human, marine, and coastal 
environment. Her decision also supports 
the production of domestic oil and gas 
to respond to the national energy 
emergency (Executive Order 14156, 
‘‘Declaring a National Energy 
Emergency,’’ (Jan. 20, 2025)), as well as 
complying with the congressional 
mandate to hold LS 258 in the Inflation 
Reduction Act. 
Alternative 6 (Preferred Alternative) 
includes the following exclusions and 
mitigation measures, described as 
alternatives in the supplemental EIS: 
Alternative 3A (Beluga Whale Critical 
Habitat Exclusion) 
This exclusion applies to the 10 OCS 
blocks that overlap with the ‘‘Area 2’’ 
beluga whale critical habitat at the 
northern tip of the proposed sale area 
analyzed in the LS 258 supplemental 
EIS. These OCS blocks will not be 
offered for lease and represent 
approximately 0.85 percent of the total 
area of the beluga whale critical habitat. 
Alternative 3C (Beluga Whale 
Nearshore Feeding Areas Mitigation) 
This mitigation measure creates 
temporal restrictions for on-lease 
seismic survey activities within the 
Lease Sale 258 area. On all 193 OCS 
blocks being offered for lease, no on- 
lease marine seismic surveys will be 
conducted between November 1 and 
April 1, when beluga whales are most 
likely to be present and distributed 
across the Lease Sale 258 area. The 
‘‘Protection of Beluga Whales 
Stipulation’’ was included on the lease 
issued as a result of LS 258. 
Additionally, for blocks located 
within 10 miles of major anadromous 
streams, lessees will not conduct on- 
lease marine seismic surveys between 
July 1 and September 30, when beluga 
whales are migrating to and from their 
summer feeding areas. The ‘‘Protection 
of Beluga Whale Nearshore Feeding 
Areas Stipulation’’ was included on the 
lease issued for blocks located within 10 
miles of major anadromous streams. 
Alternative 4A (Northern Sea Otter 
Critical Habitat Exclusion) 
This exclusion applies to the seven 
OCS blocks that overlap with the 
northern sea otter southwest Alaska 
distinct population segment (SW DPS) 
critical habitat within the proposed sale 
area analyzed in the LS 258 
supplemental EIS. These OCS blocks 
were not offered for lease. 
Alternative 4B (Northern Sea Otter 
Critical Habitat Mitigation) 
This mitigation measure prohibits 
lessees from discharging drilling fluids 
and cuttings and conducting seafloor 
disturbing activities (including 
anchoring and placement of bottom- 
founded structures) within 1,000 meters 
of areas designated as northern sea otter 
critical habitat. The ‘‘Protection of 
Northern Sea Otter SW DPS Critical 
Habitat Stipulation’’ would have been 
included on any leases issued on the 14 
OCS blocks within 1,000 meters of 
northern sea otter critical habitat. The 
single lease issued was not within this 
area. 
Alternative 5 (Gillnet Fishery 
Mitigation) 
This mitigation measure applies to the 
97 OCS blocks (whole or partial) located 
north of Anchor Point within the Lease 
Sale 258 area to reduce the potential for 
conflicts with the drift gillnet fishery. 
Lessees are prohibited from conducting 
on-lease seismic surveys during the drift 
gillnetting season, as designated by the 
Alaska Department of Fish and Game 
(approximately mid-June to mid- 
August). Lessees are required to notify 
the United Cook Inlet Drift Association 
of any temporary or permanent 
structures planned during the drift 
gillnetting season. 
For each of the lease stipulations 
described above, lessees may request a 
variance at the time of filing an ancillary 
activities notice, an exploration plan, or 
a development and production plan 
with BOEM’s regional supervisor for 
leasing and plans. Such requests must 
identify alternative methods for 
providing commensurate protection and 
analyze the effectiveness of those 
methods. While these mitigation 
measures are required by the lease itself, 
BOEM may require additional 
mitigation measures during post-lease 
plan and permit reviews, as appropriate. 
As LS 258 has already occurred, 
selecting any alternatives other than 
those described above would not affirm 
that lease sale and would void the one 
lease issued as a result of it.

Abstract: The regulations at 30 CFR part 250 stipulate the various 
requirements that must be submitted 
with an APM. The form and the 
numerous submittals that are included 
and/or attached to the form are the 
subject of this collection. This request 
also covers related notices to lessees and 
operators (NTLs) that BSEE issues to 
clarify, supplement, or provide 
additional guidance on some aspects of 
our regulations. 
The BSEE uses the information to 
ensure safe well control, completion, 
workover, and decommissioning 
operations and to protect the human, 
marine, and coastal environment. 
Among other things, BSEE specifically 
uses the information to ensure: the well 
control, completion, workover, and 
decommissioning unit (drilling/well 
operations) is fit for the intended 
purpose; equipment is maintained in a 
state of readiness and meets safety 
standards; each drilling/well operation 
crew is properly trained and able to 
promptly perform well-control activities 
at any time during well operations; 
compliance with safety standards; and 
the current regulations will provide for 
safe and proper field or reservoir 
development, resource evaluation, 
conservation, protection of correlative 
rights, safety, and environmental 
protection. 
We also review well records to 
ascertain whether the operations have 
encountered hydrocarbons or hydrogen 
sulfide (H2S) and to ensure that H2S 
detection equipment, personnel 
protective equipment, and training of 
the crew are adequate for safe 
operations in zones known to contain 
H2S and zones where the presence of 
H2S is unknown.

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with NOTICES59870 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Notices 2025. RFAAX 1, at 1. The fact that a registrant 
allows his registration to expire during the 
pendency of an administrative enforcement 
proceeding does not impact the Agency’s 
jurisdiction or prerogative under the Controlled 
Substances Act (CSA) to adjudicate the OSC to 
finality. Jeffrey D. Olsen, M.D., 84 FR 68474, 68476– 79 (2019). 
2
Based on the Government’s submissions in its 
RFAA dated October 22, 2025, the Agency finds 
that service of the OSC on Registrant was adequate. 
The included declaration from a DEA Diversion 
Investigator (DI) indicates that on September 8, 
2025, DEA employees attempted to personally serve 
Registrant at his registered address, but the address, 
a business location, appeared to be closed and/or 
abandoned. RFAAX 2, at 1. On the same day, other 
DEA employees attempted to serve Registrant at his 
residential address, where the DEA employees were 
informed that Registrant lived there but was not 
home. Id. at 1–2. On September 9, 2025, the DI mailed a copy of the OSC to Registrant’s residential 
address and received proof of delivery, with the 
delivery signed for by Registrant on September 10, 
2025. Id. at 2; see also id. at 3. Here, the Agency finds that the OSC was successfully served on 
Registrant by mail and that the DI’s efforts to serve 
Registrant by other means were ‘‘ ‘reasonably 
calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise 
[Registrant] of the pendency of the action.’ ’’ Jones v. Flowers, 547 U.S. 220, 226 (2006) (quoting Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950)).

Under the Administrative Procedure Act, an 
agency ‘‘may take official notice of facts at any stage 
in a proceeding—even in the final decision.’’ 
United States Department of Justice, Attorney 
General’s Manual on the Administrative Procedure 
Act 80 (1947) (Wm. W. Gaunt & Sons, Inc., Reprint 
1979).

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 556(e), ‘‘[w]hen an agency 
decision rests on official notice of a material fact 
not appearing in the evidence in the record, a party 
is entitled, on timely request, to an opportunity to 
show the contrary.’’ The material fact here is that 
Registrant, as of the date of this decision, is not 
licensed to practice medicine in Alabama. 
Accordingly, Registrant may dispute the Agency’s 
finding by filing a properly supported motion for 
reconsideration of findings of fact within fifteen 
calendar days of the date of this Order. Any such 
motion and response shall be filed and served by 
email to the other party and to the DEA Office of 
the Administrator, Drug Enforcement 
Administration at dea.addo.attorneys@dea.gov. 
5
This rule derives from the text of two provisions 
of the CSA. First, Congress defined the term 
‘‘practitioner’’ to mean ‘‘a physician . . . or other 
person licensed, registered, or otherwise permitted, 
by . . . the jurisdiction in which he practices ..., to distribute, dispense, . . . [or] administer . . . a 
controlled substance in the course of professional 
practice.’’ 21 U.S.C. 802(21). Second, in setting the 
requirements for obtaining a practitioner’s 
registration, Congress directed that ‘‘[t]he Attorney 
General shall register practitioners . . . if the 
applicant is authorized to dispense . . . controlled 
substances under the laws of the State in which he 
practices.’’ 21 U.S.C. 823(g)(1). Because Congress 
has clearly mandated that a practitioner possess 
state authority in order to be deemed a practitioner 
under the CSA, DEA has held repeatedly that 
revocation of a practitioner’s registration is the 
appropriate sanction whenever he is no longer 
authorized to dispense controlled substances under 
the laws of the state in which he practices. See, e.g., 
James L. Hooper, M.D., 76 FR at 71371–72; Sheran 
Arden Yeates, M.D., 71 FR 39130, 39131 (2006); 
Dominick A. Ricci, M.D., 58 FR 51104, 51105 
(1993); Bobby Watts, M.D., 53 FR 11919, 11920 (1988); Frederick Marsh Blanton, M.D., 43 FR at 27617. 
The OSC notified Registrant of his 
right to file a written request for hearing, 
and that if he failed to file such a 
request, he would be deemed to have 
waived his right to a hearing and be in 
default. Id. (citing 21 CFR 1301.43). Here, Registrant did not request a 
hearing, and the Agency finds him to be 
in default. RFAA, at 3.
2
‘‘A default, 
unless excused, shall be deemed to 
constitute a waiver of the registrant’s/ 
applicant’s right to a hearing and an 
admission of the factual allegations of 
the [OSC].’’ 21 CFR 1301.43(e). 
Further, ‘‘[i]n the event that a 
registrant . . . is deemed to be in 
default . . . DEA may then file a request 
for final agency action with the 
Administrator, along with a record to 
support its request. In such 
circumstances, the Administrator may 
enter a default final order pursuant to 
[21 CFR] 1316.67.’’ Id. 1301.43(f)(1). Here, the Government has requested 
final agency action based on Registrant’s 
default pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.43(c), 
(f), 1301.46. RFAA, at 1; see also 21 CFR 
1316.67. 
Findings of Fact 
The Agency finds that, in light of 
Registrant’s default, the factual 
allegations in the OSC are deemed 
admitted. According to the OSC, on or 
about June 6, 2025, the Medical 
Licensure Commission of Alabama 
revoked Registrant’s Alabama medical 
license. RFAAX 1, at 2. According to 
Alabama online records, of which the 
Agency takes official notice,
3
 
Registrant’s Alabama medical license 
remains revoked. Alabama Board of 
Medical Examiners and Medical 
Licensure Commission License Lookup, 
https://dashboard.albme.gov/ 
Verification/search.aspx (last visited date of signature of this Order). 
Accordingly, the Agency finds that 
Registrant is not licensed to practice 
medicine in Alabama, the state in which 
he is registered with DEA.

Discussion 
Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3), the 
Attorney General is authorized to 
suspend or revoke a registration issued 
under 21 U.S.C. 823 ‘‘upon a finding 
that the registrant . . . has had his State 
license or registration suspended . . . 
[or] revoked . . . by competent State 
authority and is no longer authorized by 
State law to engage in the . . . 
dispensing of controlled substances.’’ 
With respect to a practitioner, DEA has 
also long held that the possession of 
authority to dispense controlled 
substances under the laws of the state in 
which a practitioner engages in 
professional practice is a fundamental 
condition for obtaining and maintaining 
a practitioner’s registration. Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 270 (2006) (‘‘The Attorney General can register a 
physician to dispense controlled 
substances ‘if the applicant is 
authorized to dispense . . . controlled 
substances under the laws of the State 
in which he practices.’ . . . The very 
definition of a ‘practitioner’ eligible to 
prescribe includes physicians ‘licensed, 
registered, or otherwise permitted, by 
the United States or the jurisdiction in 
which he practices’ to dispense 
controlled substances. 802(21).’’). The 
Agency has applied these principles 
consistently. See, e.g., James L. Hooper, M.D., 76 FR 71371, 71372 (2011), pet. for rev. denied, 481 F. App’x 826 (4th 
Cir. 2012); Frederick Marsh Blanton, 
M.D., 43 FR 27616, 27617 (1978).5
 
According to Alabama statute, 
‘‘dispense’’ means ‘‘[t]o deliver a 
controlled substance to an ultimate user 
or research subject by or pursuant to the 
lawful order of a practitioner, including 
the prescribing, administering, 
packaging, labeling, or compounding 
necessary to prepare the substance for 
that delivery.’’ Ala. Code 20–2–2(7) 
(2025). Further, a ‘‘practitioner’’ 
includes a ‘‘physician . . . or other 
person licensed, registered, or otherwise 
permitted to distribute, dispense, 
conduct research with respect to, or to 
administer a controlled substance in the 
course of professional practice or 
research in [the] state.’’ Id. at § 20–2– 2(20)(a). 
Here, the undisputed evidence in the 
record is that Registrant lacks authority 
to practice medicine in Alabama. As 
discussed above, an individual must be 
a licensed practitioner to dispense a 
controlled substance in Alabama. Thus, 
because Registrant lacks authority to 
practice medicine in Alabama and, 
therefore, is not authorized to handle 
controlled substances in Alabama, 
Registrant is not eligible to maintain a 
DEA registration. Accordingly, the 
Agency will order that Registrant’s DEA 
registration be revoked.

authority vested in me by 21 U.S.C.

The United States filed this lawsuit 
on behalf of the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency for the recovery of 
response costs under section 107(a) of 
CERCLA against six electrical utility 
companies that sent transformers 
contaminated with polychlorinated 
biphenyls (or ‘‘PCBs’’), a hazardous 
substance, to the F.J. Doyle Salvage 
Superfund Site, located in Leonard, 
Texas, for disposal. The Site became 
contaminated with PCBs, and EPA 
performed a Site cleanup by excavating 
the contaminated soil. The consent 
decree resolves the United States’ 
claims against the six electrical utility 
companies: Entergy Louisiana, LLC; 
Entergy Texas, Inc.; the City of Garland, 
Texas; Lighthouse Electric Cooperative, 
Inc.; Southwestern Electric Power 
Company; and Oncor Electric Delivery 
Company LLC. Collectively, they will 
pay $1,001,630.21 of EPA’s 
$4,006,520.83 million in response costs. 
EPA has concluded that this amount is 
appropriate given each settling 
defendant’s alleged contribution to the 
Site’s contamination. In exchange, the 
United States covenants not to sue 
settling defendants to collect any 
additional response costs for the Site, 
and the settling the defendants will be 
granted protection from contribution 
actions or claims as provided by Section 
113(f)(2) of CERCLA. 
The publication of this notice opens 
a period for public comment on the 
consent decree. Comments should be

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under 49 U.S.C. 5333(b), when Federal funds are 
used to acquire, improve, or operate a 
transit system, the Department must 
ensure that the recipient of those funds 
establishes arrangements to protect the 
rights of affected transit employees. 
Federal law requires such arrangements 
to be ‘‘fair and equitable,’’ and the 
Department of Labor (DOL or the 
Department) must certify the 
arrangements before the U.S. 
Department of Transportation’s Federal 
Transit Administration (FTA) can award 
certain funds to grantees. These 
employee protective arrangements must 
include provisions that may be 
necessary for the preservation of rights, 
privileges, and benefits under existing 
collective bargaining agreements or 
otherwise; the continuation of collective 
bargaining rights; the protection of 
individual employees against a 
worsening of their positions related to 
employment; assurances of employment 
to employees of acquired transportation 
systems; assurances of priority of 
reemployment of employees whose 
employment is ended or who are laid 
off; and paid training or retraining 
programs. 49 U.S.C. 5333(b)(2). 
Pursuant to 29 CFR part 215, upon 
receipt of copies of applications for 
Federal assistance subject to 49 U.S.C. 
5333(b) from the FTA, together with a 
request for the certification of employee 
protective arrangements from the 
Department of Labor, DOL will process 
those applications. The FTA will 
provide the Department with the 
information necessary to enable the 
Department to process employee 
protections for certification of the 
project. 
DOL Procedural Guidelines (29 CFR 
part 215), encourage the development of 
employee protections through local 
negotiations, but establish time frames 
for certification to expedite the process 
and make it more predictable, while 
assuring that the required protections 
are in place. Pursuant to the Guidelines, 
DOL refers for review the grant 
application and the proposed terms and 
conditions to unions representing 
transit employees in the service area of 
the project and to the applicant and/or 
sub-recipient. No referral is made if the 
application falls under one of the 
following exceptions: (1) employees in 
the service area are not represented by 
a union; (2) the grant is for routine 
replacement items; (3) the grant is for a 
Job Access project serving populations 
less than 200,000. (29 CFR 215.3). 
Grants where employees in the service 
area are not represented by a union will 
be certified without referral based on 
protective terms and conditions set forth 
by DOL. 
When a grant application is referred 
to the parties, DOL recommends the 
terms and conditions to serve as the 
basis for certification. The parties have 
15 days to inform DOL of any objections 
to the recommended terms including 
reasons for such objections. If no 
objections are registered and no 
circumstances exist inconsistent with 
the statue, or if objections are found not 
sufficient, DOL certifies the project on 
the basis of the recommended terms. 
If DOL determines that the objections 
are sufficient, the Department, as 
appropriate, will direct the parties to 
negotiate for up to 30 days, limited to 
issues defined by DOL. 
If the parties are unable to reach 
agreement within 30 days, DOL will 
review the final proposals and, where 
no circumstances exist inconsistent 
with the statute, issue an interim 
certification permitting FTA to release 
funds, provided that no action is taken 
relating to the issues in dispute, which 
would irreparably harm employees. 
Following the interim certification, 
the parties may continue negotiations. If 
they are unable to reach agreement, DOL 
sets the terms for Final Certification 
within 60 days. DOL may request briefs 
on the issues in dispute before issuing 
the final certification. 
Notwithstanding the above, the 
Department retains the right to withhold 
certification where circumstances 
inconsistent with the statue so warrant 
until such circumstances have been 
resolved. 
Comments submitted in response to 
this notice will be summarized and/or 
included in the request for Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) 
approval of the information collection 
request; they will also become a matter 
of public record. Commenters are 
encouraged not to submit sensitive 
information (e.g. confidential business information or personally identifiable 
information such as a social security 
number). 
This information collection is subject 
to the PRA. A Federal agency generally 
cannot conduct or sponsor a collection 
of information, and the public is 
generally not required to respond to an 
information collection, unless the OMB 
approves it and displays a currently

notwithstanding any other provisions of 
law, no person shall generally be subject 
to penalty for failing to comply with a

information collection for three (3) 
years. OMB authorization for an ICR 
cannot be for more than three (3) years 
without renewal. The DOL notes that 
information collection requirements 
submitted to the OMB for existing ICRs 
receive a month-to-month extension 
while they undergo review.

between the U.S. Department of Labor 
(DOL), Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) and the U.S.

other relevant information, are also

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
DOE and OSHA have entered into two 
MOUs to address both current and 
former DOE government-owned or 
leased, contractor-operated (GOCO) 
facilities. The first MOU, entered into 
on August 10, 1992, delineates 
regulatory authority over the 
occupational safety and health of 
contractor employees at DOE GOCO 
facilities by recognizing that DOE 
exercises statutory authority under 
section 161(f) of the Atomic Energy Act 
of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2201(f)), 
relating to the occupational safety and 
health of private-sector employees at 
these facilities. 
Section 4(b)(1) of the Occupational 
Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH 
Act) (29 U.S.C. 653(b)(1)) exempts from 
OSHA authority working conditions 
with respect to which other federal 
agencies have exercised statutory 
authority to prescribe or enforce 
standards or regulations affecting 
occupational safety and health. The 
1992 MOU acknowledges DOE’s 
extensive program for the regulation of 
contractor health and safety, which 
requires contractor compliance with all 
OSHA standards along with additional 
DOE-prescribed requirements. The 
MOU sets forth an agreement that the 
provisions of the OSH Act do not apply 
to GOCO sites for which DOE has 
exercised authority to regulate 
occupational safety and health under 
the Atomic Energy Act. 
As a result of DOE’s policy emphasis 
on privatization activities, OSHA and 
DOE entered into a second MOU on July 
25, 2000, to establish interagency 
procedures addressing regulatory 
authority for occupational safety and 
health at specified privatized facilities 
and operations on sites formerly 
controlled by DOE. The July 25, 2000, 
MOU covers facilities and operations on 
lands no longer controlled by DOE, 
which are not conducting activities for, 
or on behalf of, DOE; and where there 
is no likelihood that any employee 
exposure to radiation from DOE sources 
would be 25 millirems per year (mrem/ 
yr) or more. 
II. Notice of Transfer 
Consistent with the 2000 MOU, 
between March 5, 2024 and May 20 
2025, DOE provided four separate 
notices of a transfer in ownership of 
four parcels of land at the East 
Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP) in 
Oak Ridge, Tennessee to a private sector 
entity, for the purpose of confirming 
occupational safety and health 
regulatory authority by OSHA or, as 
appropriate Tennessee OSHA (TOSHA), 
over employees at that location. Other 
transfers of facilities and properties at 
the ETTP to TOSHA authority under 
this MOU were announced by Federal 
Register notices 74 FR 120 (January 2, 2009); 74 FR 39977 (August 10, 2009); 
76 FR 80408 (December 23, 2011); 79 FR 
29456 (May 22, 2014); 83 FR 45978 
(September 11, 2018); and 85 FR 41627 
(July 10, 2020). 
The parcels of land at the ETTP in 
Oak Ridge, Tennessee are: (1) the former 
Powerhouse Area Tract [ID 11954], (2) 
the former K–1037 (ED–21) [ID 12892], 
(3) the K–732 Switchyard area (ED–20D) 
[ID 12797], and (4) the former K–27 and 
K–29 (ED–22) [ID 13136]. The former 
Powerhouse Area tract and the former 
K–1037 (ED–21) tract were transferred 
to the Heritage Center, LLC, a subsidiary 
of the Community Reuse Organization 
of East Tennessee. The former K–732 
Switchyard area (ED–20D) tract was 
transferred to the City of Oak Ridge, 
Tennessee, and the former K–27 and K– 
29 (ED–22) parcel was transferred to the 
Industrial Development Board of the 
City of Oak Ridge. The parcels of land 
contain a total of approximately 710.81 
acres. 
OSHA’s Regional Office in 
Birmingham, Alabama, working with 
the OSHA Nashville Area Office and 
TOSHA, provided notification regarding 
the transfers of occupational safety and 
health coverage for these sites to 
TOSHA. TOSHA confirmed that it has 
authority over the occupational safety 
and health of private sector and State 
and local government sector employers 
and employees performing work at each 
of the four transferred parcels of land at 
the ETTP in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In a 
letter from OSHA to DOE dated 
September 8, 2025, OSHA stated that 
TOSHA is satisfied with DOE’s 
assurances with respect to all four land 
parcels that (1) there is no likelihood 
that any employee at facilities in the 
vicinity of the land parcels will be 
exposed to radiation levels that will 
equal or exceed 25 mrem/yr, and (2) 
transfer of authority to TOSHA is free 
from regulatory gaps and does not 
diminish the safety and health 
protection of the employees. 
Accordingly, this Federal Register 
publication provides notice that TOSHA 
assumes and maintains occupational 
safety and health regulatory authority

AGENCY: Millennium Challenge Corporation. 
ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This report is provided in accordance with the Millennium 
Challenge Act of 2003, as amended. The 
report is set forth in full below. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Report on the Selection of Eligible Countries for 
Fiscal Year 2026. 
Summary 
This report is provided in accordance 
with section 608(d)(1) of the 
Millennium Challenge Act of 2003, as 
amended (the Act) (22 U.S.C. 
7707(d)(1)). 
The Act authorizes the provision of 
assistance under section 605 of the Act 
(22 U.S.C. 7704) to countries that enter 
into compacts with the United States to 
support policies and programs that 
advance the progress of such countries 
in achieving lasting economic growth 
and are in furtherance of the Act. The 
Act requires the Millennium Challenge 
Corporation (MCC) to determine the 
countries that will be eligible to receive 
assistance for the fiscal year, based on 
their demonstrated commitment to just 
and democratic governance, economic 
freedom, and investing in their people, 
as well as on the opportunity to reduce 
poverty through economic growth and 
invest in shared prosperity. The Act also 
requires the submission of reports to 
appropriate congressional committees 
and the publication of notices in the 
Federal Register that identify, among 
other things: 
1. The countries that are ‘‘candidate 
countries’’ for assistance for fiscal year 
(FY) 2026 based on their per-capita 
income levels and their eligibility to 
receive assistance under U.S. law, and 
countries that would be candidate 
countries, but for specified legal 
prohibitions on assistance (section 
608(a) of the Act (22 U.S.C. 7707(a))); 
2. The criteria and methodology that 
the Board of Directors of MCC (the 
Board) used to measure and evaluate the 
policy performance of the ‘‘candidate 
countries’’ consistent with the 
requirements of section 607 of the Act 
in order to determine ‘‘eligible 
countries’’ from among the ‘‘candidate 
countries’’ (section 608(b) of the Act (22 
U.S.C. 7707(b))); and 
3. The list of countries determined by 
the Board to be ‘‘eligible countries’’ for 
FY 2026, with justification for eligibility 
determination and selection for compact 
negotiation, including with which of the 
eligible countries the Board will seek to 
enter into compacts (section 608(d) of 
the Act (22 U.S.C. 7707(d))). 
This report fulfills the requirements 
under the third of the above-described 
reports by MCC for FY 2026. It identifies 
countries determined by the Board to be 
eligible under section 607 of the Act (22 
U.S.C. 7706) for FY 2026 with which 
MCC will initially seek to enter into 
compacts under section 609 of the Act 
(22 U.S.C. 7708), as well as the 
justification for such decisions. This 
report also identifies countries selected 
by the Board to receive assistance under 
MCC’s threshold program pursuant to 
section 616 of the Act (22 U.S.C. 7715). 
Eligible Countries 
On December 17, 2025, the Board 
selected those eligible countries with 
which the United States, through MCC, 
will initially seek to enter into a 
Millennium Challenge Compact 
pursuant to section 607 of the Act (22 
U.S.C. 7706). The Board selected 
Ecuador as eligible for such assistance 
for FY 2026. Ecuador is invited by MCC 
to develop a potential compact. 
Criteria 
In accordance with the Act and the 
‘‘Selection Criteria and Methodology 
Report for Fiscal Year 2026’’ formally 
submitted to Congress on October 3, 
2025, selection was based on a country’s 
overall performance in three broad 
policy categories: Ruling Justly, 
Encouraging Economic Freedom, and 
Investing in People. The Board relied, to 
the fullest extent possible, upon 
transparent and independent indicators 
to assess countries’ policy performance 
and demonstrated commitment in these 
policy areas. The Board compared 
countries’ performance on the indicators 
relative to their income-level peers. 
Those income peer groups in Fiscal 
Year 2026 are countries with a GNI per 
capita equal to or less than $2,155, a 
GNI per capita between $2,156 and 
$4,495, or a GNI per capita between 
$4,496 and $7,855. 
The criteria and methodology used to 
assess countries, including the 
methodology for the annual scorecards, 
are outlined in the ‘‘Selection Criteria 
and Methodology Report for Fiscal Year 
2026’’ available at https://www.mcc.gov/ 
resources/doc/report-selection-criteria- 
methodology-fy26/. Scorecards reflecting each country’s performance 
on the indicators are available on MCC’s 
website at https://www.mcc.gov/who- 
we-select/scorecards. 
Beyond the scorecard, the Board 
considered additional quantitative and 
qualitative supplemental information, 
including the investment climate and 
opportunities to strengthen market 
fundamentals, countries’ commitment to 
undertake reforms, the ability to 
advance U.S. investments and objectives 
in the country, the likelihood that MCC 
investments will be maintained and 
deliver long-term results, and the 
opportunity to reduce poverty and 
advance shared prosperity. The Board 
also considered the availability of 
appropriated funds. 
The Board sees selection decisions as 
an opportunity to determine where MCC 
funds can be most effectively deployed. 
The Board carefully considers the 
appropriate nature of each country 
partnership on a case-by-case basis. 
MCC’s engagement with its partner 
countries is not open-ended, but rather 
time-limited and based on a data-driven 
constraints analysis, and the Board is 
deliberate when selecting countries for 
follow-on partnerships, particularly 
regarding the higher bar applicable to 
subsequent and concurrent compact 
countries. The Board considered—in 
addition to the criteria outlined above— 
a country’s performance implementing 
any prior programs, including the 
nature of the country’s partnership with 
MCC, the degree to which the country 
has demonstrated a commitment and 
capacity to achieve program results, and 
the degree to which the country 
implemented a prior program in

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with NOTICES59878 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Notices accordance with MCC’s core policies 
and standards. 
Country Newly Selected as Eligible for a 
Compact 
Using the criteria described above, 
Ecuador, a candidate country under 
section 606(a) of the Act (22 U.S.C. 
7705(a)), was newly selected as eligible 
for assistance under section 607 of the 
Act (22 U.S.C. 7706). Ecuador is invited 
by MCC to develop a potential compact. 
Ecuador: Ecuador has demonstrated a commitment to undertaking significant 
reforms to make progress toward fiscal 
stability. The country has suffered 
anemic growth and low foreign direct 
investment in recent years, presenting a 
key opportunity to leverage MCC’s 
expertise to address key barriers for the 
private sector and economic growth. An 
MCC program can also demonstrate the 
U.S. Government’s commitment to 
strengthening partnerships in the 
Western Hemisphere. With Ecuador’s 
strong performance on the MCC 
scorecard and willingness to implement 
necessary reforms, an MCC program has 
the potential to make a lasting impact, 
drive shared prosperity, and generate 
clear benefits to both the United States 
and a key partner in the region. 
Countries Newly Selected to Develop 
Potential Threshold Programs 
The Board selected Bolivia and 
Guatemala to develop potential 
threshold programs. 
Bolivia: The recently elected government of Bolivia faces a daunting 
task to address an immediate 
macroeconomic and foreign exchange 
crisis and longer-term structural 
economic challenges. As a country 
experiencing a significant transition, an 
MCC threshold program can provide an 
agile mechanism for supporting the 
Bolivian government’s efforts to pursue 
reforms to lay the groundwork for 
private sector-led growth. Such a 
program also offers an opportunity to 
build the bilateral relationship and 
generate shared prosperity for Bolivia 
and the United States. 
Guatemala: A former threshold program partner, Guatemala is an 
important anchor of the U.S. 
relationship with Central America and 
has demonstrated a clear commitment to 
shared prosperity while pursuing 
needed reforms to strengthen its 
business environment to attract private 
investment. An MCC threshold program 
could support these types of efforts, 
creating a safer, stronger, and more 
prosperous future for both Guatemala 
and the United States. 
Ongoing Review of Partner Countries’ 
Policy Performance 
The Board emphasized the need for 
all partner countries to maintain or 
improve their policy performance. If it 
is determined during program 
implementation that a country has 
demonstrated a significant policy 
reversal, MCC can hold it accountable 
by applying MCC’s Suspension and 
Termination Policy available at https:// 
www.mcc.gov/resources/doc/policy-on- 
suspension-and-termination/.

and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
3
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
11, 2025, New York Stock Exchange 
LLC (‘‘NYSE’’ or the ‘‘Exchange’’) filed 
with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ‘‘Commission’’) the 
proposed rule change as described in 
Items I, II, and III below, which Items 
have been prepared by the self- 
regulatory organization. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to (i) amend 
Section 902.03 of the NYSE Listed 
Company Manual (the ‘‘Manual’) to 
amend certain of its annual fees charged 
to listed issuers of equity securities, and 
(ii) amend Section 907.00 of the Manual 
to update the value of certain products 
and services provided to issuers and 
delete obsolete rule text. The proposed 
rule change is available on the 
Exchange’s website at www.nyse.com, 
and at the principal office of the 
Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
self-regulatory organization included 
statements concerning the purpose of, 
and basis for, the proposed rule change 
and discussed any comments it received 
on the proposed rule change. The text 
of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. 
The Exchange has prepared summaries, 
set forth in sections A, B, and C below, 
of the most significant parts of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
certain of its annual fees charged to 
listed issuers as set forth in Sections 
902.03 of the Manual. The proposed 
changes will take effect from the 
beginning of the calendar year 
commencing on January 1, 2026. 
The Exchange currently charges an 
annual fee of $0.001285 per share for 
each of the following: a primary class of 
common shares (including Equity 
Investment Tracking Stocks); each 
additional class of common shares 
(including tracking stock); a primary 
class of preferred stock (if no class of 
common shares is listed); each 
additional class of preferred stock 
(whether primary class is common or 
preferred shares); and each class of 
warrants or rights. The Exchange 
proposes to change the per share annual 
fee for the foregoing classes of securities 
from $0.001285 per share to $0.001310 
per share. 
The annual fee for a primary class of 
common shares (including Equity

(June 9, 2005); 70 FR 37496 (June 29, 2005) 
(‘‘Regulation NMS’’). 
9
See Regulation NMS, 70 FR at 37499. of equity or preferred stock reflects 
increases in the costs the Exchange 
incurs in providing services to listed 
companies on an ongoing basis, as well 
as increases in the costs of conducting 
its related regulatory activities. In 2025, 
the Exchange increased its educational 
programming for listed companies and 
improved conference space at the 
Exchange that can be utilized by listed 
companies for corporate events. As 
described below, the Exchange proposes 
to make the aforementioned fee 
increases to better reflect the Exchange’s 
costs related to listing equity securities 
and the corresponding value of such 
listing to companies. 
The revised annual fees will be 
applied in the same manner to all 
issuers with listed securities in the 
affected categories and the Exchange 
believes that the changes will not 
disproportionately affect any specific 
category of issuers. 
Section 907.00 of the Manual sets 
forth the suite of services that the 
Exchange provides to certain issuers 
that meet specified eligibility 
requirements. With respect to each 
service, Section 907.00 designates an 
approximate annual value. The 
Exchange proposes to update the 
approximate values of each service to 
better reflect the current cost. In 
addition, the Exchange proposes to 
update the total value of services 
available to Tier One and Tier A issuers. 
In this regard, the Exchange notes that 
it last updated the value of these 
services in 2022 and its proposed 
change is simply to reflect the current 
cost of such services that have increased 
in recent years due to inflationary 
considerations. The Exchange does not 
propose any changes to the actual 
package of services available to issuers. 
Lastly, Section 907.00 contains 
outdated rule text that was in effect 
prior to the Commission’s approval of 
SR–NYSE–2021–68 in 2022.
4
The 
Exchange proposes to delete this 
obsolete rule text. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
Section 6(b) of the Act,
5
in general, and 
furthers the objectives of Section 
6(b)(4)
6
of the Act, in particular, in that 
it is designed to provide for the 
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees, and other charges. The Exchange 
also believes that the proposed rule 
change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
7
in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to foster cooperation and 
coordination with persons engaged in 
regulating, clearing, settling, processing 
information with respect to, and 
facilitating transactions in securities, to 
remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest and is not designed to 
permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Exchange believes that it is not 
unfairly discriminatory and represents 
an equitable allocation of reasonable 
fees to (i) amend Section 902.03 of the 
Manual to amend certain of its annual 
fees charged to listed issuers of equity 
securities, and (ii) amend Section 
907.00 of the Manual to update the 
value of certain products and services 
provided to issuers and delete obsolete 
rule text. The Exchange proposes to 
make these changes because of the 
increased costs incurred by the 
Exchange since it established the 
current rates and the more accurately 
reflect the cost of certain products and 
services provided to issuers. 
The Proposed Changes Are Reasonable 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed changes to the annual fee 
schedule (including the minimum fee) 
are reasonable. In that regard, the 
Exchange notes that its general costs to 
support its listed companies have 
increased, including due to price 
inflation. The Exchange also continues 
to expand and improve the services it 
provides to listed companies. 
Specifically, the Exchange has (among 
other things) increased expenditure on 
listed companies and the value of an 
NYSE listing by increasing 
programming for listed companies and 
enhancing its conference space which 
can be utilized by listed companies. 
The Exchange believes it is reasonable 
to update the approximate value of 
products and services offered to certain 
issuers. The Exchange notes that it has 
not updated the costs of these services 
in three years and the approximate cost 
has increased over time due to price 
inflation. 
The Exchange operates in a highly 
competitive marketplace for the listing 
of the various categories of securities 
affected by the proposed annual fee 
adjustments. The Commission has 
repeatedly expressed its preference for 
competition over regulatory 
intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities 
markets. Specifically, in Regulation 
NMS,
8
the Commission highlighted the 
importance of market forces in 
determining prices and SRO revenues 
and, also, recognized that current 
regulation of the market system ‘‘has 
been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
9
 
The Exchange believes that the ever- 
shifting market share among the 
exchanges with respect to new listings 
and the transfer of existing listings 
between competitor exchanges 
demonstrates that issuers can choose 
different listing markets in response to 
fee changes. Accordingly, competitive 
forces constrain exchange listing fees. 
Stated otherwise, changes to exchange 
listing fees can have a direct effect on 
the ability of an exchange to compete for 
new listings and retain existing listings. 
Given this competitive environment, 
the adoption of the proposed increase to 
the annual fees for various categories of 
equity securities represents a reasonable 
attempt to address the Exchange’s 
increased costs in servicing these 
listings while continuing to attract and 
retain listings. 
The Proposal Is an Equitable Allocation 
of Fees 
The Exchange believes its proposal 
equitably allocates its fees among its 
market participants. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed amendments to the annual 
fees for equity securities are equitable 
because they do not change the existing 
framework for such fees, but simply 
increase the amount of the minimum 
annual fee, and per unit annual fee to 
reflect increased operating costs. 
Similarly, as the fee structure remains 
effectively unchanged apart from the 
proposed increases in the rates paid by 
all issuers, the changes to the annual 
fees for equity securities neither target 
nor will they have a disparate impact on 
any particular category of issuer. 
The proposed changes to Section 
907.00 to update the value of products 
and services simply reflect the current 
cost of providing these services. The 
Exchange does not propose to amend 
the actual suite of available services or 
the eligibility criteria to benefit from 
such services. 
The Proposal Is Not Unfairly 
Discriminatory 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposal is not unfairly discriminatory.

The proposed fee changes are not 
unfairly discriminatory among issuers of 
operating company equity securities 
because the same fee schedule will 
apply to all such issuers. Further, the 
Exchange operates in a competitive 
environment and its fees are constrained 
by competition in the marketplace. 
Other venues currently list all of the 
categories of securities covered by the 
proposed fees and if a company believes 
that the Exchange’s fees are 
unreasonable it can decide either not to 
list its securities or to list them on an 
alternative venue. The proposed 
updates to the value of products and 
services available to certain issuers is 
similarly no discriminatory because the 
change is simply to reflect the current 
cost of such services and the Exchange 
is not proposing to amend its eligibility 
criteria. 
For the foregoing reasons, the 
Exchange believes that the proposal is 
consistent with the Act. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
proposed rule change is designed to 
ensure that the fees charged by the 
Exchange accurately reflect the services 
provided and benefits realized by listed 
companies. The market for listing 
services is extremely competitive. Each 
listing exchange has a different fee 
schedule that applies to issuers seeking 
to list securities on its exchange. Issuers 
have the option to list their securities on 
these alternative venues based on the 
fees charged and the value provided by 
each listing. Because issuers have a 
choice to list their securities on a 
different national securities exchange, 
the Exchange does not believe that the 
proposed fee changes impose a burden 
on competition. 
Intramarket Competition 
The proposed amended fees will be 
charged to all listed issuers on the same 
basis. The Exchange does not believe 
that the proposed amended fees will 
have any meaningful effect on the 
competition among issuers listed on the 
Exchange. 
Intermarket Competition 
The Exchange operates in a highly 
competitive market in which issuers can 
readily choose to list new securities on 
other exchanges and transfer listings to 
other exchanges if they deem fee levels 
at those other venues to be more 
favorable. Because competitors are free 
to modify their own fees, and because 
issuers may change their chosen listing 
venue, the Exchange does not believe its 
proposed fee change can impose any 
burden on intermarket competition. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were solicited 
or received with respect to the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of 
the Act,

and Rule 19b–4(f)(2) 
thereunder
11
the Exchange has 
designated this proposal as establishing 
or changing a due, fee, or other charge 
imposed on any person, whether or not 
the person is a member of the self- 
regulatory organization, which renders 
the proposed rule change effective upon 
filing. At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act.

The Exchange initially filed the proposed fee 
changes on December 2, 2025 (SR–C2–2025–026). 
On December 15, 2025, the Exchange withdrew that 
filing and submitted (SR–C2–2025–028). On 
December 17, 2025, the Exchange withdrew that 
filing and submitted this proposal.

The Exchange also proposes to make 
nonsubstantive changes to the rule text that the 
ORF fee is charged per contract side. This is 
consistent with how the ORF fee has been charged 
and is merely a clarification to the Fee Schedule. 
5
On July 1, 2026, the ORF rate will revert back 
to $0.0002 per contract side. 
6
The Exchange is not looking to capture its 
traditional 75% threshold at this time, since it is 
contemporaneously submitting a separate rule filing 
to adopt a new ORF model, effective July 1, 2026 
(subject to adoption of a similar model by all 
options exchanges).

II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule

In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes
3
to 
temporarily increase the Options 
Regulatory Fee (‘‘ORF’’) from $0.0002 
per contract side to $0.0003 per contract 
side,
4
effective January 2, 2026.
5
 
Background 
Today, ORF is assessed by the 
Exchange to each Trading Permit Holder 
(‘‘TPH’’) for options transactions cleared 
by the TPH that are cleared by the 
Options Clearing Corporation (‘‘OCC’’) 
in the customer range, regardless of the 
exchange on which the transaction 
occurs. In other words, the Exchange 
imposes the ORF on all customer-range 
transactions cleared by a TPH, even if 
the transactions do not take place on the 
Exchange. The ORF is collected by OCC 
on behalf of the Exchange from the 
Clearing TPH or non-TPH that 
ultimately clears the transaction. With 
respect to linkage transactions, the 
Exchange reimburses its routing broker 
providing Routing Services pursuant to 
Rule 5.36 for options regulatory fees it 
incurs in connection with the Routing 
Services it provides. 
Revenue generated from ORF, when 
combined with all of the Exchange’s 
other regulatory fees and fines, is 
designed to recover a material portion of 
the regulatory costs to the Exchange of 
the supervision and regulation of TPH 
customer options business including 
performing routine surveillances, 
investigations, examinations, financial 
monitoring, and policy, rulemaking, 
interpretive, and enforcement activities. 
Regulatory costs include direct 
regulatory expenses and certain indirect 
expenses for work allocated in support 
of the regulatory function. The direct 
expenses include in-house and third- 
party service provider costs to support 
the day-to-day regulatory work such as 
surveillances, investigations and 
examinations. The indirect expenses 
include support from such areas as 
human resources, legal, compliance, 
information technology, facilities and 
accounting. These indirect expenses are 
estimated to be approximately 23% of 
the Exchange’s total regulatory costs for 
2026. Thus, direct expenses are 
estimated to be approximately 77% of 
total regulatory costs for 2026. In 
addition, based on the Exchange’s 
analysis of its regulatory work 
associated with options regulation, and 
considering other regulatory revenue, it 
is the Exchange’s practice that revenue 
generated from ORF not exceed more 
than 75% of total annual regulatory 
costs. These expectations are estimated, 
preliminary and may be subject to 
change. Currently, and for quite some 
time now, the Exchange has been 
collecting significantly lower than the 
75% threshold. Under the current rate 
the Exchange forecasts for 2026 to 
collect closer to 43%. Even with this 
proposed temporary increase, the 
forecast only goes up to approximately 
64%.
6
 
Proposal for January 2, 2026 
The Exchange monitors its regulatory 
costs and revenues at a minimum on a 
semi-annual basis. If the Exchange 
determines regulatory revenues exceed 
or are insufficient to cover a material 
portion of its regulatory costs in a given 
year, the Exchange will adjust the ORF 
by submitting a fee change filing to the 
Commission. Although the Exchange 
has been collecting at levels that do not 
cover a material portion of its regulatory 
expenses, it has not raised its rate for 
quite some time now but for this 
proposal. 
The Exchange also notifies TPHs of 
adjustments to the ORF via an Exchange 
Notice, including for the change being 
proposed herein.
7
Based on the 
Exchange’s most recent semi-annual 
review, the Exchange is proposing to 
temporarily increase the amount of ORF 
that will be collected by the Exchange 
from $0.0002 per contract side to 
$0.0003 per contract side.
8
The 
proposed temporary increase is based 
on the Exchange’s estimated projections 
for its regulatory costs, which 
projections have increased. Particularly, 
based on the Exchange’s estimated 
projections for its regulatory costs, the 
revenue generated by ORF using the 
current rate, would result in projected 
revenue that is insufficient to cover a 
material portion of its regulatory costs 
(i.e., less than 75% of total annual regulatory costs). Further, when 
combined with the Exchange’s projected 
other non-ORF regulatory fees and fines, 
the revenue generated by ORF using the 
current rate is projected to result in 
combined revenue that is less than 
100% of the Exchange’s estimated 
regulatory costs for the year. As noted 
above, even with this proposed 
temporary rate increase, the amount 
collected by the Exchange will be 
significantly lower than the 75% 
threshold. As the Exchange has done in 
the past, the Exchange will also provide 
the Commission confidential details 
regarding the Exchange’s projected 
regulatory revenue, including projected 
revenue from ORF, along with a 
breakout of its projected regulatory 
expenses, including both direct and 
indirect allocations. 
The Exchange will continue to 
monitor the amount of revenue 
collected from the ORF to ensure that it, 
in combination with its other regulatory 
fees and fines, does not exceed the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. 
New ORF Model 
The Exchange appreciates the 
evolving changes in the markets and 
regulatory environment and has been 
evaluating its options while considering 
industry and regulatory feedback. In 
light of this, the Exchange has been 
reviewing its current methodologies and 
practices for the assessment and 
collection of ORF. As a result of this 
review, the Exchange is submitting 
contemporaneously with this filing 
another filing that proposes to adopt a 
modified ORF model that updates the 
Exchange’s process of assessing and 
collecting ORF, in which model ORF

See e.g., NYSE Arca Options Fees and Charges, 
Options Regulatory Fee (‘‘ORF’’) and NYSE 
American Options Fees Schedule, Section VII(A), 
which provide that ORF is assessed at a rate of 
$0.0026 per contract side for each respective 
exchange (effective January 1, 2026). 
13
Consistent with Rule 2.2 (Regulatory Revenue), 
the Exchange notes that should excess ORF revenue 
be collected prior to any reduction in an ORF rate, 
such excess revenue will not be used for 
nonregulatory purposes. 
14
If the Exchange changes its method of funding 
regulation or if circumstances otherwise change in 
the future, the Exchange may decide to modify the 
ORF or assess a separate regulatory fee on TPH 
proprietary transactions if the Exchange deems it 
advisable. 
15
ISG is an industry organization formed in 1983 
to coordinate intermarket surveillance among the 
SROs by cooperatively sharing regulatory 
information pursuant to a written agreement 
between the parties. The goal of the ISG’s 
information sharing is to coordinate regulatory 
efforts to address potential intermarket trading 
abuses and manipulations. 
would be assessed to only on-Exchange 
transactions that clear in the customer 
range at OCC. Under the proposed 
modified model, the Exchange expects 
to continue its current practice that 
revenue generated from ORF not exceed 
75% of total annual regulatory costs. 
And as is the Exchange’s practice today, 
revenue generated by ORF will not be 
used for nonregulatory purposes. 
To create real ORF reform, moving to 
a new ORF model that only assesses a 
fee to transactions that occur on one’s 
own options exchange seems right. 
However, for a new, modified model to 
be truly meaningful and fair, a rate 
limited to transactions on one’s own 
exchange should be adopted by all 
options exchanges to provide a 
consistent methodology in assessing and 
collecting ORF going forward. As set 
forth in its separate filing that proposes 
the new, modified ORF model, the 
Exchange is committed to switching to 
this new model as soon as a consistent 
framework has been established with 
the SEC, adopted by all the options 
exchanges and necessary regulatory 
filings submitted. Until that time, the 
Exchange believes it’s fair and 
reasonable to maintain the temporarily 
higher rate under the existing model. 
In light of the Exchange’s pending 
proposal to revamp ORF, the Exchange 
proposes to adopt a sunset date of June 
30, 2026 for the proposed rate of 
$0.0003 per contract side, at which 
point the ORF would revert back to 
$0.0002 per contract side. The proposed 
sunset date will provide time for 
establishment of one new, unified 
model going forward. The Exchange will 
endeavor to implement the modified 
ORF structure prior to the proposed 
June 30, 2026 sunset date. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’) and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
9
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) 
of the Act,
10
which provides that 
Exchange rules may provide for the 
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees, and other charges among its TPHs 
and other persons using its facilities. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
11
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
fee change is reasonable because it 
would help ensure that revenue 
collected from the ORF, in combination 
with other regulatory fees and fines, 
would help offset, but not exceed, the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. As 
discussed, the Exchange has designed 
the ORF to generate revenues that 
would be less than or equal to 75% of 
the Exchange’s regulatory costs, which 
is consistent with the practice across the 
options industry and the view of the 
Commission that regulatory fees be used 
for regulatory purposes and not to 
support the Exchange’s business side. 
The Exchange determined to 
temporarily increase ORF after its semi- 
annual review of its regulatory costs and 
regulatory revenues, which includes 
revenues from ORF and other regulatory 
fees and fines. When taking into account 
recent options volume, coupled with the 
anticipated regulatory fees and 
anticipated reductions in other 
regulatory fees, the Exchange believes 
it’s reasonable to increase the ORF on a 
temporary basis, effective January 2, 
2026. Particularly, the proposed change 
is reasonable as it would offset the 
anticipated increased regulatory costs, 
while still not exceeding 75% of the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. 
Moreover, the proposed amount is still 
lower than the amount of ORF assessed 
on other exchanges.
12
 
As noted above, the Exchange will 
also continue to monitor on at least a 
semi-annual basis the amount of 
revenue collected from the ORF, even as 
amended, to ensure that it, in 
combination with its other regulatory 
fees and fines, does not exceed the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. If the 
Exchange determines regulatory 
revenues would exceed its regulatory 
costs in a given year, the Exchange will 
reduce the ORF by submitting a fee 
change filing to the Commission.
13
 
The Exchange also believes the 
proposed fee change is equitable and 
not unfairly discriminatory in that it is 
charged to all TPHs on all their 
transactions that clear in the customer 
range at the OCC. The Exchange 
believes the ORF ensures fairness by 
assessing higher fees to those TPHs that 
require more Exchange regulatory 
services based on the amount of 
customer options business they 
conduct. Regulating customer trading 
activity is much more labor intensive 
and requires greater expenditure of 
human and technical resources than 
regulating non-customer trading 
activity, which tends to be more 
automated and less labor-intensive. For 
example, there are costs associated with 
main office and branch office 
examinations (e.g., staff and travel expenses), as well as investigations into 
customer complaints and the 
terminations of registered persons. As a 
result, the costs associated with 
administering the customer component 
of the Exchange’s overall regulatory 
program are materially higher than the 
costs associated with administering the 
non-customer component (e.g., TPH proprietary transactions) of its 
regulatory program.
14
Moreover, the 
Exchange notes that it has broad 
regulatory responsibilities with respect 
to its TPHs’ activities, irrespective of 
where their transactions take place. 
Many of the Exchange’s surveillance 
programs for customer trading activity 
may require the Exchange to look at 
activity across all markets, such as 
reviews related to position limit 
violations and manipulation. Indeed, 
the Exchange cannot effectively review 
for such conduct without looking at and 
evaluating activity regardless of where it 
transpires. In addition to its own 
surveillance programs, the Exchange 
also works with other SROs and 
exchanges on intermarket surveillance 
related issues. Through its participation 
in the Intermarket Surveillance Group 
(‘‘ISG’’)
15
the Exchange shares 
information and coordinates inquiries 
and investigations with other exchanges 
designed to address potential 
intermarket manipulation and trading 
abuses. Accordingly, there is a strong 
nexus between the ORF and the 
Exchange’s regulatory activities with 
respect to its TPHs’ customer trading 
activity.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. This 
proposal does not create an unnecessary 
or inappropriate intramarket burden on 
competition because ORF applies to all 
customer activity, thereby raising 
regulatory revenue to offset regulatory 
expenses. It also supplements the 
regulatory revenue derived from non- 
customer activity. The Exchange notes, 
however, the proposed change is not 
designed to address any competitive 
issues. Indeed, this proposal does not 
create an unnecessary or inappropriate 
intermarket burden on competition 
because it is a regulatory fee that 
supports regulation in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. The Exchange is 
obligated to ensure that the amount of 
regulatory revenue collected from the 
ORF, in combination with its other 
regulatory fees and fines, does not 
exceed regulatory costs. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received written comments on the 
proposed rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) 
of the Act

and paragraph (f) of Rule 
19b–4
17
thereunder. At any time within 
60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved.

The term ‘‘Order’’ means an instruction to trade 
a specified number of shares in a specified NMS 
stock submitted to the BX Equities Market by a 
Participant. An ‘‘Order Type’’ is a standardized set 
of instructions associated with an Order that define 
how it will behave with respect to pricing, 
execution, and/or posting to the Exchange Book 
when submitted to BX. See BX Equity 1, Section 1(a)(11). The Exchange Book is a montage for quotes 
and orders that collects and ranks all quotes and 
orders submitted by Participants. See BX Equity 1, Section 1(a)(6)(1).

Book when submitted to BX. The available Order 
Types and Order Attributes, and the Order 
Attributes that may be associated with particular 
Order Types, are described in Equity 4 Rules 4702 
and 4703. One or more Order Attributes may be

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Nasdaq 
BX, Inc.; Notice of Filing and 
Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed 
Rule Change To Discontinue the Good- 
Till-Cancelled Time-in-Force Order 
Attribute in Its Equities Market 
December 17, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
12, 2025, Nasdaq BX, Inc. (‘‘BX’’ or 
‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’ or 
‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III, below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to 
discontinue the Good-Till-Cancelled 
Time-in-Force Order Attribute in its 
equities market. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/bx/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to 
discontinue the Time-in-Force of Good- 
Till-Cancelled from its equities market. 
Participants who trade equities in the 
Exchange can choose among many 
Order Types.
3
Participants can also 
choose to apply different Order 
Attributes to their Orders.
4
One of those 
Order Attributes is Time-in-Force 
(‘‘TIF’’).
5
The TIF assigned to an Order 
is the period of time that the System 
will hold the Order for potential 
execution. Participants specify an 
Order’s TIF by designating a time at 
which the Order will become active and 
a time at which the Order will cease to 
be active.
6
Among the times available 
for Order deactivation is one year after 
Order entry.
7
 
An Order that is designated to 
deactivate one year after entry may be 
referred to as a ‘‘Good-till-Cancelled’’ or 
‘‘GTC’’ Order. If a GTC Order is 
designated as eligible for execution 
during Market Hours
8
only, it may be 
referred to as having a Time in Force of 
‘‘Market Hours Good-till-Cancelled’’ or 
‘‘MGTC.’’
9
If a GTC Order is designated 
as eligible for execution during System 
Hours,
10
it may be referred to as having 
a Time in Force of ‘‘System Hours Good- 
till-Cancelled’’ or ‘‘SGTC.’’
11
Therefore, 
both in the Exchange’s rules and in this 
filing, references to the TIF of GTC 
include both the TIF of MGTC and the 
TIF of SGTC. 
The Exchange proposes to 
discontinue the availability of the GTC 
TIF on its equities market. In order to 
do so, the Exchange proposes to modify 
BX Equity 4, Rule 4703(a) to delete ‘‘one 
year after entry’’ from the list of 
available times for deactivating an 
Order. The Exchange also proposes to 
modify BX Equity 4, Rule 4703(a)(3), 
which contains the definition of the 
GTC TIF, by deleting it in its entirety 
and reserving that rule number. 
The Exchange also proposes to make 
the following conforming changes to its 
Equity Rules, to delete all other 
references to GTC Orders: 
€BX Equity 4, Rule 4702(b)(7)(B) specifies that a Market Maker Peg Order 
may not have a TIF of GTC. The 
Exchange proposes to remove this 
reference to GTC. 
€BX Equity 4, Rule 4761 concerns procedures in response to issuer 
corporate actions, including any 
dividend (whether payable in cash or 
securities or both), payment, 
distribution, forward or reverse stock 
split, symbol change, or change in 
primary listing venue. Rule 4761(b) 
contains only such procedures that are 
specific to Orders with a TIF of GTC. 
Therefore, the Exchange proposes to 
remove Rule 4761(b) in its entirety. 
Consistent with this change, the 
Exchange proposes to redesignate Rule 
4761(a) as Rule 4761, and to remove the 
introductory ‘‘Except as provided 
below,’’ introductory phrase to that rule. 
€BX Equity 6, Section 5 sets out the risk settings that the Exchange offers to 
a Participant’s activities on the 
Exchange. Section 5(c) concerns Cancel- 
on-Disconnect Control. This optional 
control allows a Participant, when it 
experiences a disruption in its 
connection to the Exchange, to 
immediately cancel all pending 
Exchange Orders except GTC Orders. 
The Exchange proposes to remove this 
reference to GTC Orders. 
€BX Equity 9, Section 1 concerns the adjustment of open orders. Section 1(d) 
defines ‘‘open order’’ as an order to buy

Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this 
requirement. 
or an open stop order to sell, including 
but not limited to, ‘‘good ‘til cancelled’’ 
orders, among others. The Exchange 
proposes to remove this reference to 
‘‘good ‘til cancelled.’’ 
Starting on the day that the Exchange 
discontinues the GTC TIF Order 
Attribute, any new GTC Orders sent to 
the Exchange will be rejected. Any GTC 
Orders remaining on the Exchange Book 
at the close of the trading day 
immediately preceding the 
discontinuation of the GTC TIF Order 
Attribute will be cancelled by the 
Exchange. The discontinuation of the 
GTC TIF Order Attribute will become 
operative in the first quarter of 2026. 
The Exchange currently intends to 
discontinue GTC Orders on February 2, 
2026. Therefore, any GTC Orders 
remaining on the Exchange Book at the 
close of trading on January 30, 2026, 
would be cancelled by the Exchange.
12
 
If the Exchange were to postpone this 
February 2, 2026, discontinuation date 
to a later date in the first quarter of 
2026, the new discontinuation date 
would be communicated by the 
Exchange through an Equity Trader 
Alert. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
13
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
14
 
in particular, in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
It is consistent with the Act for the 
Exchange to modify the Order Attributes 
available on equities orders on the 
Exchange. BX has found that very few 
Participants avail themselves of the GTC 
TIF. Retaining this functionality adds 
complexity to the Exchange’s rulebook 
that outweighs its utility to Participants. 
Discontinuing this disused functionality 
will promote just and equitable 
principles of trade and remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system by 
streamlining the TIFs offered on the 
Exchange. 
It is also consistent with the Act to 
delete all references GTC Orders found 
in the Exchange’s listing rules and 
Equity Rules. Removing this now- 
obsolete rule text will promote just and 
equitable principles of trade and remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system by 
avoiding any possible confusion as to 
the discontinuation of the GTC TIF 
functionality. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule changes will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. In this 
regard, proposed changes that 
streamline the Order Attributes 
available on the Exchange are pro- 
competitive because they bolster the 
efficiency, functionality, and overall 
attractiveness of the Exchange in an 
absolute sense and relative to its peers. 
Moreover, the proposed changes will 
not unduly burden intra-market 
competition among various Exchange 
participants. BX has observed that very 
few Participants currently avail 
themselves of the GTC TIF, so that it is 
no longer worthwhile for the Exchange 
to retain this functionality and its 
attendant complexity. The Exchange 
would continue to offer Participants 
many other TIF options to help them 
achieve their trading objectives. 
Furthermore, if there are Participants 
who are dissatisfied with the proposal, 
they are free to shift their order flow to 
competing venues that may offer them 
order handling functionality that better 
suits their trading objectives. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: (i) significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant 
burden on competition; and (iii) become 
operative for 30 days from the date on 
which it was filed, or such shorter time 
as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
15
and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b–4 
thereunder.
16
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

The Exchange initially filed the proposed fee 
changes on December 2, 2025 (SR–CboeBZX–2025– 
156). On December 15, 2025, the Exchange 
withdrew that filing and submitted (SR–CboeBZX–

withdrew that filing and submitted this proposal.

The Exchange also proposes to make 
nonsubstantive changes to the rule text that the 
ORF fee is charged per contract side. This is 
consistent with how the ORF fee has been charged 
and is merely a clarification to the Fee Schedule.

On July 1, 2026, the ORF rate will revert back 
to $0.0001 per contract side.

The Exchange is not looking to capture its 
traditional 75% threshold at this time, since it is 
contemporaneously submitting a separate rule filing 
to adopt a new ORF model, effective July 1, 2026 
(subject to adoption of a similar model by all 
options exchanges).

forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes
3
to 
temporarily increase the Options 
Regulatory Fee (‘‘ORF’’) from $0.0001 
per contract side to $0.0002 per contract 
side,
4
effective January 2, 2026.
5
 
Background 
Today, ORF is assessed by the 
Exchange to each Member for options 
transactions cleared by the Member that 
are cleared by the Options Clearing 
Corporation (‘‘OCC’’) in the customer 
range, regardless of the exchange on 
which the transaction occurs. In other 
words, the Exchange imposes the ORF 
on all customer-range transactions 
cleared by a Member, even if the 
transactions do not take place on the 
Exchange. The ORF is collected by OCC 
on behalf of the Exchange from the 
Clearing Member or non-Member that 
ultimately clears the transaction. With 
respect to linkage transactions, the 
Exchange reimburses its routing broker 
providing Routing Services pursuant to 
Rule 21.9 for options regulatory fees it 
incurs in connection with the Routing 
Services it provides. 
Revenue generated from ORF, when 
combined with all of the Exchange’s 
other regulatory fees and fines, is 
designed to recover a material portion of 
the regulatory costs to the Exchange of 
the supervision and regulation of 
Member customer options business 
including performing routine 
surveillances, investigations, 
examinations, financial monitoring, and 
policy, rulemaking, interpretive, and 
enforcement activities. Regulatory costs 
include direct regulatory expenses and 
certain indirect expenses for work 
allocated in support of the regulatory 
function. The direct expenses include 
in-house and third-party service 
provider costs to support the day-to-day 
regulatory work such as surveillances, 
investigations and examinations. The 
indirect expenses include support from 
such areas as human resources, legal, 
compliance, information technology, 
facilities and accounting. These indirect 
expenses are estimated to be 
approximately 28% of the Exchange’s 
total regulatory costs for 2026. Thus, 
direct expenses are estimated to be 
approximately 72% of total regulatory 
costs for 2026. In addition, based on the 
Exchange’s analysis of its regulatory 
work associated with options regulation, 
and considering other regulatory 
revenue, it is the Exchange’s practice 
that revenue generated from ORF not 
exceed more than 75% of total annual 
regulatory costs. These expectations are 
estimated, preliminary and may be 
subject to change. Currently, and for 
quite some time now, the Exchange has 
been collecting significantly lower than 
the 75% threshold. Under the current 
rate the Exchange forecasts for 2026 to 
collect closer to 41%. Even with this 
proposed temporary increase, the 
forecast only goes up to approximately 
60%.
6
 
Proposal for January 2, 2026 
The Exchange monitors its regulatory 
costs and revenues at a minimum on a 
semi-annual basis. If the Exchange 
determines regulatory revenues exceed 
or are insufficient to cover a material 
portion of its regulatory costs in a given 
year, the Exchange will adjust the ORF 
by submitting a fee change filing to the 
Commission. Although the Exchange 
has been collecting at levels that do not 
cover a material portion of its regulatory 
expenses, it has not raised its rate for 
quite some time now but for this 
proposal. 
The Exchange also notifies Members 
of adjustments to the ORF via an 
Exchange Notice, including for the 
change being proposed herein.
7
Based 
on the Exchange’s most recent semi- 
annual review, the Exchange is 
proposing to temporarily increase the 
amount of ORF that will be collected by 
the Exchange from $0.0001 per contract 
side to $0.0002 per contract side.

See e.g., NYSE Arca Options Fees and Charges, 
Options Regulatory Fee (‘‘ORF’’) and NYSE 
American Options Fees Schedule, Section VII(A), 
which provide that ORF is assessed at a rate of 
$0.0026 per contract side for each respective 
exchange (effective January 1, 2026). 
13
Consistent with Rule 2.2 (Regulatory Revenue), 
the Exchange notes that should excess ORF revenue 
be collected prior to any reduction in an ORF rate, 
such excess revenue will not be used for 
nonregulatory purposes. 
proposed temporary increase is based 
on the Exchange’s estimated projections 
for its regulatory costs, which 
projections have increased. Particularly, 
based on the Exchange’s estimated 
projections for its regulatory costs, the 
revenue generated by ORF using the 
current rate, would result in projected 
revenue that is insufficient to cover a 
material portion of its regulatory costs 
(i.e., less than 75% of total annual regulatory costs). Further, when 
combined with the Exchange’s projected 
other non-ORF regulatory fees and fines, 
the revenue generated by ORF using the 
current rate s projected to result in 
combined revenue that is less than 
100% of the Exchange’s estimated 
regulatory costs for the year. As noted 
above, even with this proposed 
temporary rate increase, the amount 
collected by the Exchange will be 
significantly lower than the 75% 
threshold. As the Exchange has done in 
the past, the Exchange will also provide 
the Commission confidential details 
regarding the Exchange’s projected 
regulatory revenue, including projected 
revenue from ORF, along with a 
breakout of its projected regulatory 
expenses, including both direct and 
indirect allocations. 
The Exchange will continue to 
monitor the amount of revenue 
collected from the ORF to ensure that it, 
in combination with its other regulatory 
fees and fines, does not exceed the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. 
New ORF Model 
The Exchange appreciates the 
evolving changes in the markets and 
regulatory environment and has been 
evaluating its options while considering 
industry and regulatory feedback. In 
light of this, the Exchange has been 
reviewing its current methodologies and 
practices for the assessment and 
collection of ORF. As a result of this 
review, the Exchange is submitting 
contemporaneously with this filing 
another filing that proposes to adopt a 
modified ORF model that updates the 
Exchange’s process of assessing and 
collecting ORF, in which model ORF 
would be assessed to only on-Exchange 
transactions that clear in the customer 
range at OCC. Under the proposed 
modified model, the Exchange expects 
to continue its current practice that 
revenue generated from ORF not exceed 
75% of total annual regulatory costs. 
And as is the Exchange’s practice today, 
revenue generated by ORF will not be 
used for nonregulatory purposes. 
To create real ORF reform, moving to 
a new ORF model that only assesses a 
fee to transactions that occur on one’s 
own options exchange seems right. 
However, for a new, modified model to 
be truly meaningful and fair, a rate 
limited to transactions on one’s own 
exchange should be adopted by all 
options exchanges to provide a 
consistent methodology in assessing and 
collecting ORF going forward. As set 
forth in its separate filing that proposes 
the new, modified ORF model, the 
Exchange is committed to switching to 
this new model as soon as a consistent 
framework has been established with 
the SEC, adopted by all the options 
exchanges and necessary regulatory 
filings submitted. Until that time, the 
Exchange believes it’s fair and 
reasonable to maintain the temporarily 
higher rate under the existing model. 
In light of the Exchange’s pending 
proposal to revamp ORF, the Exchange 
proposes to adopt a sunset date of June 
30, 2026 for the proposed rate of 
$0.0002 per contract side, at which 
point the ORF would revert back to 
$0.0001 per contract side. The proposed 
sunset date will provide time for 
establishment of one new, unified 
model going forward. The Exchange will 
endeavor to implement the modified 
ORF structure prior to the proposed 
June 30, 2026 sunset date. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’) and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
9
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) 
of the Act,
10
which provides that 
Exchange rules may provide for the 
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees, and other charges among its 
Members and other persons using its 
facilities. Additionally, the Exchange 
believes the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the Section 6(b)(5)
11
 
requirement that the rules of an 
exchange not be designed to permit 
unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
fee change is reasonable because it 
would help ensure that revenue 
collected from the ORF, in combination 
with other regulatory fees and fines, 
would help offset, but not exceed, the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. As 
discussed, the Exchange has designed 
the ORF to generate revenues that 
would be less than or equal to 75% of 
the Exchange’s regulatory costs, which 
is consistent with the practice across the 
options industry and the view of the 
Commission that regulatory fees be used 
for regulatory purposes and not to 
support the Exchange’s business side. 
The Exchange determined to 
temporarily increase ORF after its semi- 
annual review of its regulatory costs and 
regulatory revenues, which includes 
revenues from ORF and other regulatory 
fees and fines. When taking into account 
recent options volume, coupled with the 
anticipated regulatory fees and 
anticipated reductions in other 
regulatory fees, the Exchange believes 
it’s reasonable to increase the ORF on a 
temporary basis, effective January 2, 
2026. Particularly, the proposed change 
is reasonable as it would offset the 
anticipated increased regulatory costs, 
while still not exceeding 75% of the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. 
Moreover, the proposed amount is still 
lower than the amount of ORF assessed 
on other exchanges.
12
 
As noted above, the Exchange will 
also continue to monitor on at least a 
semi-annual basis the amount of 
revenue collected from the ORF, even as 
amended, to ensure that it, in 
combination with its other regulatory 
fees and fines, does not exceed the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. If the 
Exchange determines regulatory 
revenues would exceed its regulatory 
costs in a given year, the Exchange will 
reduce the ORF by submitting a fee 
change filing to the Commission.
13
 
The Exchange also believes the 
proposed fee change is equitable and 
not unfairly discriminatory in that it is 
charged to all Members on all their 
transactions that clear in the customer 
range at the OCC. The Exchange 
believes the ORF ensures fairness by 
assessing higher fees to those Members 
that require more Exchange regulatory 
services based on the amount of 
customer options business they 
conduct. Regulating customer trading 
activity is much more labor intensive 
and requires greater expenditure of 
human and technical resources than 
regulating non-customer trading 
activity, which tends to be more 
automated and less labor-intensive. For 
example, there are costs associated with 
main office and branch office 
examinations (e.g., staff and travel VerDate Sep<11>2014  21:51 Dec 19, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00104 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\22DEN1.SGM 22DEN1
tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with NOTICES59890 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Notices 14
If the Exchange changes its method of funding 
regulation or if circumstances otherwise change in 
the future, the Exchange may decide to modify the 
ORF or assess a separate regulatory fee on Member 
proprietary transactions if the Exchange deems it 
advisable. 
15
ISG is an industry organization formed in 1983 
to coordinate intermarket surveillance among the 
SROs by cooperatively sharing regulatory 
information pursuant to a written agreement 
between the parties. The goal of the ISG’s 
information sharing is to coordinate regulatory 
efforts to address potential intermarket trading 
abuses and manipulations.

expenses), as well as investigations into 
customer complaints and the 
terminations of registered persons. As a 
result, the costs associated with 
administering the customer component 
of the Exchange’s overall regulatory 
program are materially higher than the 
costs associated with administering the 
non-customer component (e.g., Member proprietary transactions) of its 
regulatory program.
14
Moreover, the 
Exchange notes that it has broad 
regulatory responsibilities with respect 
to its Members’ activities, irrespective of 
where their transactions take place. 
Many of the Exchange’s surveillance 
programs for customer trading activity 
may require the Exchange to look at 
activity across all markets, such as 
reviews related to position limit 
violations and manipulation. Indeed, 
the Exchange cannot effectively review 
for such conduct without looking at and 
evaluating activity regardless of where it 
transpires. In addition to its own 
surveillance programs, the Exchange 
also works with other SROs and 
exchanges on intermarket surveillance 
related issues. Through its participation 
in the Intermarket Surveillance Group 
(‘‘ISG’’)
15
the Exchange shares 
information and coordinates inquiries 
and investigations with other exchanges 
designed to address potential 
intermarket manipulation and trading 
abuses. Accordingly, there is a strong 
nexus between the ORF and the 
Exchange’s regulatory activities with 
respect to its Members’ customer trading 
activity. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. This 
proposal does not create an unnecessary 
or inappropriate intramarket burden on 
competition because ORF applies to all 
customer activity, thereby raising 
regulatory revenue to offset regulatory 
expenses. It also supplements the 
regulatory revenue derived from non- 
customer activity. The Exchange notes, 
however, the proposed change is not 
designed to address any competitive 
issues. Indeed, this proposal does not 
create an unnecessary or inappropriate 
intermarket burden on competition 
because it is a regulatory fee that 
supports regulation in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. The Exchange is 
obligated to ensure that the amount of 
regulatory revenue collected from the 
ORF, in combination with its other 
regulatory fees and fines, does not 
exceed regulatory costs. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received written comments on the 
proposed rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) 
of the Act
16
and paragraph (f) of Rule 
19b–4
17
thereunder. At any time within 
60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments

arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

Controls (Simple Orders). Specifically, 
the Exchange proposes changes the 
wide market protection mechanism set 
forth in Rule 5.34(a)(5). 
By way of background, the wide 
market protection mechanism is 
designed to reduce the risk of orders 
executing at extreme or adverse prices 
when the NBBO is determined to be 
wide. The wide market protection 
mechanism leverages the Exchange’s 
iterative drill-through protection 
mechanism for certain orders when the 
NBBO is wide and initiates a drill- 
through pause on applicable inbound 
market or limit orders or elected Stop 
(Stop-Loss)
3
or Stop-Limit
4
orders 
which would either execute or post to 
the Book
5
at potentially extreme prices. 
Currently, pursuant to Rule 
5.34(a)(5)(D), bulk messages, 
Intermarket Sweep Orders (‘‘ISOs’’), 
Immediate-or-Cancel orders (‘‘IOCs’’), 
and M and N capacity
6
orders with a 
Time-in-Force of Day
7
are excluded 
from the wide market protection 
mechanism. The Exchange proposes to 
amend Rule 5.34(a)(4)(D) to exclude all 
M and N capacity orders from the wide 
market protection mechanism 
(regardless of Time-in-Force). 
As noted, the current rules already 
exclude M and N capacity orders with 
a Time-in-Force of Day, which 
encompasses the majority of Market- 
Maker orders. In general, Market-Makers 
are positioned to observe and 
subsequently address wide market 
scenarios, by tightening the NBBO with 
an order or quote. The proposed change 
merely extends the current rules to 
include any other potential type of 
Market-Maker order, thereby ensuring 
consistency across all potential types of 
Market-Maker orders. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’) and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
8
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5)
9
requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged 
in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, 
and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
10
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
In particular, the Exchange believes 
the proposed rule change to exclude all 
M and N capacity orders from the wide 
market protection mechanism 
(regardless of Time-in-Force) will 
remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in 
general, protect investors. In its initial 
proposal, the Exchange proposed to 
exclude only M and N capacity orders 
with Time-in-Force of Day, as the 
majority of Market-Maker orders are 
submitted with a Time-in-Force of Day. 
The proposed change to exclude all M 
and N capacity orders, regardless of 
Time-in-Force, is designed to ensure 
consistency across all potential types of 
Market-Maker orders. The Exchange 
believes the proposed change is 
reasonable, as Market-Makers are 
positioned to observe and subsequently 
address wide market scenarios, by 
tightening the NBBO with an order or 
quote. The Exchange believes the 
proposed change will support the 
operational efficiency of the wide 
market protection mechanism and 
alleviate potential confusion, by 
removing an unnecessary operational 
distinction between types of Market- 
Maker orders, to the benefit of investors. 
Finally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed change to exclude all M and 
N capacity orders is not unfairly 
discriminatory, as the proposed change 
will apply to all M and N capacity 
orders. The current rules already 
exclude M and N capacity orders with 
a Time-in-Force of Day, which 
encompasses the majority of Market- 
Maker orders. The proposed change 
merely extends the current rules to 
include any other potential type of

the proposed rule change, along with a brief 
description and text of the proposed rule change,

Market-Maker order. As noted above, 
Market-Makers are best positioned to 
observe and address wide market 
scenarios. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
Exchange does not believe that the 
proposed rule change will impose any 
burden on intramarket competition that 
is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act 
because the proposed change will apply 
to all M and N capacity orders 
uniformly, regardless of Time-in-Force. 
As noted above, the Exchange believes 
the proposed change is not unfairly 
discriminatory, as Market-Makers are 
best positioned to observe and address 
wide market scenarios. 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on intermarket competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act, 
as the proposed rule change relates 
specifically to price protections offered 
on the Exchange and which orders are 
subject to the price protection 
mechanism. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received comments on the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The Exchange has filed the proposed 
rule change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act
11
and Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6)
12
thereunder. Because the 
foregoing proposed rule change does 
not: (i) significantly affect the protection 
of investors or the public interest; (ii) 
impose any significant burden on 
competition; and (iii) become operative 
for 30 days from the date on which it 
was filed, or such shorter time as the 
Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act
13
and Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6)
14
thereunder. 
A proposed rule change filed under 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
15
normally does not 
become operative prior to 30 days after 
the date of the filing. However, pursuant 
to Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii),
16
the 
Commission may designate a shorter 
time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public 
interest. The Exchange has asked the 
Commission to waive the 30-day 
operative delay so that the proposed 
rule change may become operative 
immediately upon filing. The Exchange 
believes waiver of the operative delay is 
consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest 
because it will allow the Exchange to 
more expeditiously implement the 
proposed changes which will support 
the operational efficiency of the wide 
market protection mechanism and 
alleviate potential confusion, by 
removing an unnecessary operational 
distinction between types of Market- 
Maker orders, to the benefit of investors. 
For these reasons, and because the 
proposed rule change does not raise any 
novel legal or regulatory issues, the 
Commission finds that waiver of the 30- 
day operative delay is consistent with 
the protection of investors and the 
public interest. Therefore, the 
Commission hereby waives the 30-day 
operative delay and designates the 
proposed rule change to be operative 
upon filing.
17
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

This sentence was placed in its current location 
in 2024 as part of a larger reorganization of the 
Continued 
and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’ or 
‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III, below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to adopt 
PHLX Options 9, Section 25 to codify 
the Exchange’s longstanding guidance 
that the unbundling of orders for any 
purpose other than best execution is 
considered conduct inconsistent with 
just and equitable principles of trade, 
and to remove extraneous and 
nonsensical rule text from PHLX 
Options 3, Section 7. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/phlx/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
PHLX Options 9 by adding a new 
Section 25 to codify its longstanding 
guidance that it shall be considered 
conduct inconsistent with just and 
equitable principles of trade for any 
member, member organization, or 
person associated with or employed by 
a member or member organization 
(collectively, ‘‘member’’ or ‘‘members’’) 
to split an order into multiple smaller 
orders for any purpose other than 
seeking the best execution of the entire 
order. Members of the Exchange are not 
allowed to engage in conduct 
inconsistent with just and equitable 
principles of trade.
3
 
‘‘Unbundling,’’ also known as ‘‘trade 
shredding,’’ is the practice of breaking 
up an order into multiple smaller orders 
for some purpose other than the best 
execution of the order. The practice of 
unbundling has in the past been used 
for purposes such as improperly 
maximizing commissions and fees 
charged to customers, distorting trade 
data, or circumventing rules pertaining 
to maximum order size.
4
For example, 
the unbundling of a large order into 
several smaller orders could be done for 
the purpose of achieving the Lead 
Market Maker (LMM) allocation 
preference for orders of 5 contracts or 
fewer.
5
Alternatively, unbundling an 
order into separate orders could be done 
for the purpose of gaining a higher 
allocation percentage in a price- 
improvement auction than the member 
submitting the orders into a price- 
improvement auction otherwise would 
have received.
6
 
The Exchange believes that the 
unbundling of orders generally serves 
no purpose to the customer that entered 
the order and may cause unnecessary 
delays in the execution of that order. 
This belief has been reflected in the 
Exchange’s longstanding regulatory 
guidance to its members.
7
It is also 
reflected in PHLX General 9, Section 
1(c)(3), concerning the unbundling of 
equity securities orders.
8
 
The impermissibility of unbundling is 
a well-established principle across the 
U.S. securities markets. Other options 
exchanges have anti-unbundling rules 
or rule interpretations that are similar to 
the rule being adopted by the 
Exchange.
9
Additionally, other 
exchanges have also issued regulatory 
guidance to their members warning 
them against the practice of 
unbundling.
10
Finally, the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority 
(‘‘FINRA’’) also has its own anti- 
unbundling rule, FINRA Rule 5290, 
which specifies, in part, that ‘‘[n]o 
member . . . shall engage in conduct 
that has the intent or effect of splitting 
any order into multiple smaller orders 
for execution or any execution into 
multiple smaller executions for 
transaction reporting for the primary 
purpose of maximizing a monetary or 
in-kind amount to be received by the 
member . . . as a result of the execution 
of such orders or the transaction 
reporting of such executions.’’ 
Additionally, the Exchange proposes 
to remove from PHLX Option 3, Section 
7 the following sentence: ‘‘Orders may 
not be unbundled, nor may a firm solicit 
a customer to unbundle an order for this 
purpose.’’
11
This sentence appears

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with NOTICES59894 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Notices Exchange’s rulebook. The sentence used to be 
located in Option 3, Section 7(f) as a standalone 
provision. The Exchange now believes that, even in 
its former location, this rule text was extraneous 
and nonsensical and should have been removed 
instead of relocated in that prior filing. See Securities Exchange Act No. 101989 (Dec. 19, 2024), 
89 FR 106888 (Dec. 30, 2024) (File No. SR–PHLX– 
2024–71) (Self-Regulatory Organizations; Nasdaq

Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change To Amend 
Various PHLX Rules in Connection With a

prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule 
change, or such shorter time as designated by the 
Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this 
requirement.

extraneous, as it does not seem to 
belong with the preceding sentence 
(‘‘The Exchange may determine to make 
certain order types and time-in-force, 
respectively, on a class or System 
basis.’’). The sentence is also 
nonsensical, as it is not at all clear what 
it refers to by ‘‘for this purpose.’’ The 
Exchange suspects that this rule text 
may be a vestigial remain of some older 
Exchange rule that has since been 
modified so much as to make this 
sentence nonsensical. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
12
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
13
 
in particular, in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general to protect 
investors and the public interest, by 
deterring and helping to prevent the 
distortive practice of unbundling. 
The Exchange believes that the 
unbundling of orders generally serves 
no purpose to the customer that entered 
the order and may cause unnecessary 
delays in the execution of that order. 
Codifying its longstanding guidance in 
its rulebook that unbundling is conduct 
inconsistent with just and equitable 
principles of trade is thus designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade. Additionally, by defining 
unbundling as the practice of splitting 
an order into multiple smaller orders for 
any purpose other than seeking the best 
execution of the entire order, the 
proposal is designed to promote best 
execution and thus protect investors 
and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange reiterates 
that the proposed rule is substantively 
identical to NYSE American Rule 
995NY(d) and it is consistent with the 
rules and regulatory guidance of other 
exchanges, as well as FINRA Rule 5290. 
Finally, the Exchange believes that it 
is consistent with the Act to remove the 
extraneous and nonsensical rule text in 
PHLX Options 3, Section 7, as this 
likely vestigial rule text currently serves 
no purpose and can be confusing to 
market participants. Removing this rule 
text is designed to remove impediments 
to and perfect the mechanism of a free 
and open market and a national market 
system by making PHLX Options 3, 
Section 7 more internally coherent and 
clearer to market participants. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. In terms of 
intra-market competition, the Exchange 
notes that the proposed rule will apply 
equally to all members of the Exchange. 
Additionally, in terms of intermarket 
competition, the Exchange notes that 
the proposed rule is consistent with the 
rules of other exchanges, as well as the 
rules of FINRA. Finally, removing the 
extraneous and nonsensical rule text in 
PHLX Options 3, Section 7 will not 
impose any burden on competition, as 
it will serve to clarify that rule for all 
market participants. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: (i) significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant 
burden on competition; and (iii) become 
operative for 30 days from the date on 
which it was filed, or such shorter time 
as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
14
and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b–4 
thereunder.
15
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to

The Exchange initially filed the proposed fee 
changes on December 2, 2025 (SR–CboeEDGX– 
2025–083). On December 15, 2025, the Exchange 
withdrew that filing and submitted this proposal.

The Exchange also proposes to make 
nonsubstantive changes to the rule text that the 
ORF fee is charged per contract side. This is 
consistent with how the ORF fee has been charged 
and is merely a clarification to the Fee Schedule.

On July 1, 2026, the ORF rate will revert back

The Exchange is not looking to capture its

contemporaneously submitting a separate rule filing 
to adopt a new ORF model, effective July 1, 2026

Background 
Today, ORF is assessed by the 
Exchange to each Member for options 
transactions cleared by the Member that 
are cleared by the Options Clearing 
Corporation (‘‘OCC’’) in the customer 
range, regardless of the exchange on 
which the transaction occurs. In other 
words, the Exchange imposes the ORF 
on all customer-range transactions 
cleared by a Member, even if the 
transactions do not take place on the 
Exchange. The ORF is collected by OCC 
on behalf of the Exchange from the 
Clearing Member or non-Member that 
ultimately clears the transaction. With 
respect to linkage transactions, the 
Exchange reimburses its routing broker 
providing Routing Services pursuant to 
Rule 21.9 for options regulatory fees it 
incurs in connection with the Routing 
Services it provides. 
Revenue generated from ORF, when 
combined with all of the Exchange’s 
other regulatory fees and fines, is 
designed to recover a material portion of 
the regulatory costs to the Exchange of 
the supervision and regulation of 
Member customer options business 
including performing routine 
surveillances, investigations, 
examinations, financial monitoring, and 
policy, rulemaking, interpretive, and 
enforcement activities. Regulatory costs 
include direct regulatory expenses and 
certain indirect expenses for work 
allocated in support of the regulatory 
function. The direct expenses include 
in-house and third-party service 
provider costs to support the day-to-day 
regulatory work such as surveillances, 
investigations and examinations. The 
indirect expenses include support from 
such areas as human resources, legal, 
compliance, information technology, 
facilities and accounting. These indirect 
expenses are estimated to be 
approximately 34% of the Exchange’s 
total regulatory costs for 2026. Thus, 
direct expenses are estimated to be 
approximately 66% of total regulatory 
costs for 2026. In addition, based on the 
Exchange’s analysis of its regulatory 
work associated with options regulation, 
and considering other regulatory 
revenue, it is the Exchange’s practice 
that revenue generated from ORF not 
exceed more than 75% of total annual 
regulatory costs. These expectations are 
estimated, preliminary and may be 
subject to change. Currently, and for 
quite some time now, the Exchange has 
been collecting significantly lower than 
the 75% threshold. Under the current 
rate the Exchange forecasts for 2026 to 
collect closer to 40%. Even with this 
proposed temporary increase, the 
forecast only goes up to approximately 
60%.
6
 
Proposal for January 2, 2026 
The Exchange monitors its regulatory 
costs and revenues at a minimum on a 
semi-annual basis. If the Exchange 
determines regulatory revenues exceed 
or are insufficient to cover a material 
portion of its regulatory costs in a given 
year, the Exchange will adjust the ORF 
by submitting a fee change filing to the 
Commission. Although the Exchange 
has been collecting at levels that do not 
cover a material portion of its regulatory 
expenses, it has not raised its rate for 
quite some time now but for this 
proposal. 
The Exchange also notifies Members 
of adjustments to the ORF via an 
Exchange Notice, including for the 
change being proposed herein.
7
Based 
on the Exchange’s most recent semi- 
annual review, the Exchange is 
proposing to temporarily increase the 
amount of ORF that will be collected by 
the Exchange from $0.0001 per contract 
side to $0.0002 per contract side.
8
The 
proposed temporary increase is based 
on the Exchange’s estimated projections 
for its regulatory costs, which 
projections have increased. Particularly, 
based on the Exchange’s estimated 
projections for its regulatory costs, the 
revenue generated by ORF using the 
current rate, would result in projected 
revenue that is insufficient to cover a 
material portion of its regulatory costs

Consistent with Rule 2.2 (Regulatory Revenue), 
the Exchange notes that should excess ORF revenue 
be collected prior to any reduction in an ORF rate, 
such excess revenue will not be used for 
nonregulatory purposes. 
regulatory costs). Further, when 
combined with the Exchange’s projected 
other non-ORF regulatory fees and fines, 
the revenue generated by ORF using the 
current rate is projected to result in 
combined revenue that is less than 
100% of the Exchange’s estimated 
regulatory costs for the year. As noted 
above, even with this proposed 
temporary rate increase, the amount 
collected by the Exchange will be 
significantly lower than the 75% 
threshold. As the Exchange has done in 
the past, the Exchange will also provide 
the Commission confidential details 
regarding the Exchange’s projected 
regulatory revenue, including projected 
revenue from ORF, along with a 
breakout of its projected regulatory 
expenses, including both direct and 
indirect allocations. 
The Exchange will continue to 
monitor the amount of revenue 
collected from the ORF to ensure that it, 
in combination with its other regulatory 
fees and fines, does not exceed the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. 
New ORF Model 
The Exchange appreciates the 
evolving changes in the markets and 
regulatory environment and has been 
evaluating its options while considering 
industry and regulatory feedback. In 
light of this, the Exchange has been 
reviewing its current methodologies and 
practices for the assessment and 
collection of ORF. As a result of this 
review, the Exchange is submitting 
contemporaneously with this filing 
another filing that proposes to adopt a 
modified ORF model that updates the 
Exchange’s process of assessing and 
collecting ORF, in which model ORF 
would be assessed to only on-Exchange 
transactions that clear in the customer 
range at OCC. Under the proposed 
modified model, the Exchange expects 
to continue its current practice that 
revenue generated from ORF not exceed 
75% of total annual regulatory costs. 
And as is the Exchange’s practice today, 
revenue generated by ORF will not be 
used for nonregulatory purposes. 
To create real ORF reform, moving to 
a new ORF model that only assesses a 
fee to transactions that occur on one’s 
own options exchange seems right. 
However, for a new, modified model to 
be truly meaningful and fair, a rate 
limited to transactions on one’s own 
exchange should be adopted by all 
options exchanges to provide a 
consistent methodology in assessing and 
collecting ORF going forward. As set 
forth in its separate filing that proposes 
the new, modified ORF model, the 
Exchange is committed to switching to 
this new model as soon as a consistent 
framework has been established with 
the SEC, adopted by all the options 
exchanges and necessary regulatory 
filings submitted. Until that time, the 
Exchange believes it’s fair and 
reasonable to maintain the temporarily 
higher rate under the existing model. 
In light of the Exchange’s pending 
proposal to revamp ORF, the Exchange 
proposes to adopt a sunset date of June 
30, 2026 for the proposed rate of 
$0.0002 per contract side, at which 
point the ORF would revert back to 
$0.0001 per contract side. The proposed 
sunset date will provide time for 
establishment of one new, unified 
model going forward. The Exchange will 
endeavor to implement the modified 
ORF structure prior to the proposed 
June 30, 2026 sunset date. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’) and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
9
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) 
of the Act,
10
which provides that 
Exchange rules may provide for the 
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees, and other charges among its 
Members and other persons using its 
facilities. Additionally, the Exchange 
believes the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the Section 6(b)(5)
11
 
requirement that the rules of an 
exchange not be designed to permit 
unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
fee change is reasonable because it 
would help ensure that revenue 
collected from the ORF, in combination 
with other regulatory fees and fines, 
would help offset, but not exceed, the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. As 
discussed, the Exchange has designed 
the ORF to generate revenues that 
would be less than or equal to 75% of 
the Exchange’s regulatory costs, which 
is consistent with the practice across the 
options industry and the view of the 
Commission that regulatory fees be used 
for regulatory purposes and not to 
support the Exchange’s business side. 
The Exchange determined to 
temporarily increase ORF after its semi- 
annual review of its regulatory costs and 
regulatory revenues, which includes 
revenues from ORF and other regulatory 
fees and fines. When taking into account 
recent options volume, coupled with the 
anticipated regulatory fees and 
anticipated reductions in other 
regulatory fees, the Exchange believes 
it’s reasonable to increase the ORF on a 
temporary basis, effective January 2, 
2026. Particularly, the proposed change 
is reasonable as it would offset the 
anticipated increased regulatory costs, 
while still not exceeding 75% of the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. 
Moreover, the proposed amount is still 
lower than the amount of ORF assessed 
on other exchanges.
12
 
As noted above, the Exchange will 
also continue to monitor on at least a 
semi-annual basis the amount of 
revenue collected from the ORF, even as 
amended, to ensure that it, in 
combination with its other regulatory 
fees and fines, does not exceed the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. If the 
Exchange determines regulatory 
revenues would exceed its regulatory 
costs in a given year, the Exchange will 
reduce the ORF by submitting a fee 
change filing to the Commission.
13
 
The Exchange also believes the 
proposed fee change is equitable and 
not unfairly discriminatory in that it is 
charged to all Members on all their 
transactions that clear in the customer 
range at the OCC. The Exchange 
believes the ORF ensures fairness by 
assessing higher fees to those Members 
that require more Exchange regulatory 
services based on the amount of 
customer options business they 
conduct. Regulating customer trading 
activity is much more labor intensive 
and requires greater expenditure of 
human and technical resources than 
regulating non-customer trading 
activity, which tends to be more 
automated and less labor-intensive. For 
example, there are costs associated with 
main office and branch office 
examinations (e.g., staff and travel expenses), as well as investigations into 
customer complaints and the 
terminations of registered persons. As a 
result, the costs associated with 
administering the customer component 
of the Exchange’s overall regulatory 
program are materially higher than the 
costs associated with administering the 
non-customer component (e.g., Member proprietary transactions) of its 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  21:51 Dec 19, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00111 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\22DEN1.SGM 22DEN1

If the Exchange changes its method of funding 
regulation or if circumstances otherwise change in 
the future, the Exchange may decide to modify the 
ORF or assess a separate regulatory fee on Member 
proprietary transactions if the Exchange deems it 
advisable.

14
Moreover, the 
Exchange notes that it has broad 
regulatory responsibilities with respect 
to its Member s’ activities, irrespective 
of where their transactions take place. 
Many of the Exchange’s surveillance 
programs for customer trading activity 
may require the Exchange to look at 
activity across all markets, such as 
reviews related to position limit 
violations and manipulation. Indeed, 
the Exchange cannot effectively review 
for such conduct without looking at and 
evaluating activity regardless of where it 
transpires. In addition to its own 
surveillance programs, the Exchange 
also works with other SROs and 
exchanges on intermarket surveillance 
related issues. Through its participation 
in the Intermarket Surveillance Group 
(‘‘ISG’’)
15
the Exchange shares 
information and coordinates inquiries 
and investigations with other exchanges 
designed to address potential 
intermarket manipulation and trading 
abuses. Accordingly, there is a strong 
nexus between the ORF and the 
Exchange’s regulatory activities with 
respect to its Members’ customer trading 
activity. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. This 
proposal does not create an unnecessary 
or inappropriate intramarket burden on 
competition because ORF applies to all 
customer activity, thereby raising 
regulatory revenue to offset regulatory 
expenses. It also supplements the 
regulatory revenue derived from non- 
customer activity. The Exchange notes, 
however, the proposed change is not 
designed to address any competitive 
issues. Indeed, this proposal does not 
create an unnecessary or inappropriate 
intermarket burden on competition 
because it is a regulatory fee that 
supports regulation in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. The Exchange is 
obligated to ensure that the amount of 
regulatory revenue collected from the 
ORF, in combination with its other 
regulatory fees and fines, does not 
exceed regulatory costs. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received written comments on the 
proposed rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) 
of the Act
16
and paragraph (f) of Rule 
19b–4
17
thereunder. At any time within 
60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the 
Act,
7
the Commission is hereby 
instituting proceedings to determine 
whether to approve or disapprove the 
proposed rule change. 
II. Description of the Proposed Rule 
Change 
Recently, the Exchange amended its 
rules in connection with plans to list 
and trade MGTN index options.
8
MGTN 
index options are cash-settled, 
European-style options based on the 
MGTN index, an equal-weighted 
benchmark composed of 10 large-cap 
U.S.-listed technology and growth- 
oriented companies with listed 
options.
9
Constituents include 
companies such as Apple, Microsoft, 
Nvidia, and Tesla, and are fixed unless 
adjusted due to corporate actions.
10
 
Replacements are selected from a 
reserve list based on market 
capitalization, trading volume, and 
classification under the technology 
sector.
11
The MGTN index is reviewed 
quarterly for reserve list updates and 
rebalanced monthly.
12
 
The Exchange now proposes to amend 
Cboe Rule 5.4(a) to change the 
minimum increment for all series of 
MGTN index options to $0.01 for series 
trading lower than $3.00 and $0.05 for 
series trading at $3.00 or higher.
13
The 
Exchange believes market demand 
supports a lower trading increment for 
MGTN index options.
14
The Exchange 
states that the options overlying the 
components of the MGTN index, as well 
as the underlying stocks, are among the 
most actively traded options and stocks, 
respectively, which, according to the 
Exchange, supports its view that there 
will be market demand for the proposed 
trading increments for MGTN index 
options.
15
The Exchange states that it 
expects the proposal to lead to 
narrowing of the bid-ask spread for 
MGTN index options, which the 
Exchange believes will increase order 
flow in MGTN index options.
16
 
The Exchange also states that options 
overlying the individual component 
stocks of the MGTN index are 
competitive with MGTN index 
options
17
and that the options overlying 
the MGTN index components are 
currently eligible for the Penny Interval 
Program.
18
The Exchange states that 
permitting it to price MGTN index 
options at that minimum increment, as 
is proposed herein, would allow 
competitor products to be priced with 
the same granularity.
19
The Exchange 
further states that market participants 
may use options overlying each 
component of the MGTN index to hedge 
MGTN index options or as part of other 
investment strategies involving MGTN 
index options.
20
According to the 
Exchange, aligning the pricing 
increment for MGTN index options with 
options overlying MGTN index 
components will permit investors to 
trade related products at more granular 
prices that may be more aligned with 
their investment objectives.
21
In 
addition, the Exchange represents that it 
and the Options Price Reporting 
Authority have the necessary systems 
capacity to handle any potential 
additional traffic associated with this 
proposal.
22
 
III. Proceedings To Determine Whether 
To Approve or Disapprove the 
Proposed Rule Change 
The Commission hereby institutes 
proceedings pursuant to Section 
19(b)(2)(B) of the Act
23
to determine 
whether the Exchange’s proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved. Institution of proceedings 
does not indicate that the Commission 
has reached any conclusions with 
respect to any of the issues involved. 
Rather, the Commission seeks and 
encourages interested persons to 
provide additional comment on the 
proposed rule change to inform the 
Commission’s analysis of whether to 
approve or disapprove the proposed 
rule change. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the 
Act,
24
the Commission is providing 
notice of the grounds for disapproval 
under consideration. The Commission is 
instituting proceedings to allow for 
additional analysis of, and input from 
commenters with respect to, the 
consistency of the proposed rule change 
with the Act and, in particular, Section 
6(b)(5) of the Act,
25
which requires that 
the rules of a national securities 
exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest, and not be designed to 
permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
Under the Commission’s Rules of 
Practice, the ‘‘burden to demonstrate 
that a proposed rule change is 
consistent with the [Act] and the rules 
and regulations issued thereunder . . . 
is on the self-regulatory organization 
that proposed the rule change.’’
26
The 
description of a proposed rule change, 
its purpose and operation, its effect, and 
a legal analysis of its consistency with 
applicable requirements must all be 
sufficiently detailed and specific to 
support an affirmative Commission 
finding,
27
and any failure of a self- 
regulatory organization to provide this 
information may result in the 
Commission not having a sufficient 
basis to make an affirmative finding that 
a proposed rule change is consistent 
with the Act and the applicable rules 
and regulations.
28
 
As discussed above, the Exchange 
proposes to reduce the minimum 
trading increment for all series of MGTN 
index options to $0.01 for series trading 
lower than $3.00 and $0.05 for series 
trading at $3.00 or higher. The 
Commission is concerned that the 
proposal does not provide an adequate 
basis, at this time, for the Commission

SRO. See Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Report of the Senate Committee on Banking,

to conclude that the proposed minimum 
trading increment for MGTN index 
options would be consistent with the 
Act. The Exchange states that its view 
that market demand supports the 
proposed minimum increment for 
MGTN index options is supported by 
highly active trading in the stock 
components of the MGTN index and 
options on those components.
29
But 
MGTN index options had not yet begun 
trading at the time of the filing of the 
proposal, so the proposal does not (and 
could not) set forth trading data 
demonstrating actual market demand for 
MGTN index options. In addition, the 
Exchange states that the proposal would 
align the minimum increment for 
MGTN index options with related, 
competitor products—namely, options 
on the individual stock components of 
the MGTN index—that also may be used 
to hedge MGTN index option 
positions.
30
But the Commission is 
concerned that the proposal does not 
provide an adequate basis to conclude 
that MGTN index options would be a 
competitive alternative to options on 
individual stock components of the 
MGTN index. The Commission asks that 
commenters address the sufficiency of 
the Exchange’s statements in support of 
the proposal, which are set forth in the 
Notice, in addition to any other 
comments they may wish to submit 
about the proposed rule change. 
Accordingly, the Commission is 
instituting proceedings to allow for 
additional consideration and comment 
on the issues raised herein, including as 
to whether the proposal is consistent 
with the Act.
31
 
IV. Commission’s Solicitation of 
Comments 
The Commission requests written 
views, data, and arguments with respect 
to the concerns identified above as well 
as any other relevant concerns. Such 
comments should be submitted by 
January 12, 2026. Rebuttal comments 
should be submitted by January 26, 
2026. Although there do not appear to 
be any issues relevant to approval or 
disapproval that would be facilitated by 
an oral presentation of views, data, and 
arguments, the Commission will 
consider, pursuant to Rule 19b–4, any 
request for an opportunity to make an 
oral presentation.
32
 
The Commission asks that 
commenters address the sufficiency and 
merit of the Exchange’s statements in 
support of the proposal, in addition to 
any other comments they may wish to 
submit about the proposed rule change.

Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed 
Rule Change To Adopt a New 
Methodology for Assessment and 
Collection of the Options Regulatory 
Fee (ORF) 
December 17, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
12, 2025, Cboe Exchange, Inc. (the 
‘‘Exchange’’ or ‘‘Cboe Options’’) filed 
with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ‘‘Commission’’) the 
proposed rule change as described in 
Items I, II, and III below, which Items 
have been prepared by the Exchange. 
The Commission is publishing this 
notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change from interested 
persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
Cboe Exchange, Inc. (the ‘‘Exchange’’ 
or ‘‘Cboe Options’’) proposes to amend 
its Fees Schedule relating to the Options 
Regulatory Fee (‘‘ORF’’) to adopt a new 
methodology for assessment and 
collection of ORF for transactions that 
occur on the Exchange (‘‘On-Exchange 
ORF’’). The text of the proposed rule 
change is provided in Exhibit 5. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is also available on the Commission’s 
website (https://www.sec.gov/rules/ 
sro.shtml), the Exchange’s website 
(https://www.cboe.com/us/options/ 
regulation/rule_filings/bzx/), and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements.

Currently, the ORF is assessed by Cboe Options 
and collected via OCC on executions for the 
account of Public Customers, including 
Professionals, and Broker-Dealers including Foreign 
Broker-Dealers. These market participants clear in 
the ‘‘C’’ range at OCC. ORF will continue to be 
assessed to executions for the account of these 
market participants under the proposed 
methodology. On the Exchange, a ‘‘Public 
Customer’’ means a person that is not a broker or 
dealer in securities and includes both Priority 
Customers and Professionals. A ‘‘Priority 
Customer’’ means a person or entity that is a Public 
Customer and is not a Professional. A 
‘‘Professional’’ is any person or entity that (a) is not 
a broker or dealer in securities, and (b) places more 
than 390 orders in listed options per day on average 
during a calendar month for its own beneficial 
account(s). Executions for the account of an OCC 
clearing member firm proprietary account, joint 
back office account clearing in the Firm range, or 
account of a market maker clearing in the Market 
Maker range are not charged an ORF, nor would 
they be charged an ORF under the current proposal. 
4
Pursuant to a separately filed rule change, the 
current ORF rate of $0.0023 will sunset the earlier 
of June 30, 2026 and revert to $0.0017 as of July 
1, 2026. 
5
The Exchange notes ORF also applies to 
Customer-range transactions executed during 
Global Trading Hours. 
6
The Exchange notes that in the case where a 
non-self clearing TPH executes a transaction on the 
Exchange, the TPH’s guaranteeing CTPH is reflected 
as the Executing Clearing Firm in the OCC cleared 
trades file and the ORF is assessed to and collected 
from the Executing Clearing Firm. 
7
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 82164 (November 28, 2017), 82 FR 57313 (December 4, 
2017) (SR–CBOE–2017–074). 
8
The Exchange notes that OCC provides the 
Exchange and other exchanges with information to 
assist in excluding CMTA transfers done to correct 
bona fide errors from the ORF calculation. 
Specifically, if a clearing firm gives up or CMTA 
transfers a position to the wrong clearing firm, the 
firm that caused the error will send an offsetting 
CMTA transfer to that firm and send a new CMTA 
transfer to the correct firm. The offsetting CMTA 
transfer is marked with a CMTA Transfer ORF 
Indicator which results in the original erroneous 
transfer being excluded from the ORF calculation.

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 58817 (October 20, 2008), 73 FR 63744 (October 27, 2008) 
(SR–CBOE–2008–105). 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
current methodology for assessment and 
collection of a regulatory fee to assess 
On-Exchange ORF only for options 
transactions that occur on the Exchange 
that would clear in the customer
3
range 
at The Options Clearing Corporation 
(‘‘OCC’’). The Exchange would no 
longer assess a regulatory fee for options 
transactions that occur on other 
exchanges. This proposal only proposes 
to amend the method of assessment and 
collection of the fee. A future rule filing 
would be filed to set the applicable On- 
Exchange ORF rate. If the On-Exchange 
ORF model were to go into effect today, 
the current ORF rate would increase 
from $0.0023 per contract to an 
estimated On-Exchange ORF rate of 
$0.01331 per contract based on 2026 
estimates of regulatory revenue, 
regulatory costs, and customer volume. 
The following provides more detail 
regarding the proposal.
4
 
Background 
Today, ORF is assessed by Cboe 
Options to each Clearing Trading Permit 
Holder (‘‘CTPH’’) for options 
transactions that are cleared by the 
CTPH at OCC in the Customer range, 
regardless of the exchange on which the 
transaction occurs.
5
In other words, the 
Exchange imposes the ORF on all 
Customer-range transactions cleared by 
a CTPH, even if the transactions do not 
take place on the Exchange. The ORF is 
collected by OCC on behalf of the 
Exchange from the CTPH or non- 
Trading Permit Holder (‘‘TPH’’) OCC 
Clearing Member that ultimately clears 
the transaction as further described 
below. With respect to linkage 
transactions, Cboe Options reimburses 
its routing broker providing Routing 
Services pursuant to Cboe Options Rule 
5.36 for options regulatory fees it incurs 
in connection with the Routing Services 
it provides. The current Cboe Options 
ORF is $0.0023 per contract side. 
The following scenarios reflect how 
the ORF is currently assessed and 
collected (these apply regardless of 
whether the transaction is executed on 
the Exchange or on an away exchange): 
1. If a TPH is the executing clearing 
firm on a transaction (‘‘Executing 
Clearing Firm’’), the ORF is assessed to 
and collected from that TPH by OCC on 
behalf of the Exchange. 
2. If a TPH is the Executing Clearing 
Firm and the transaction is ‘‘given up’’ 
to a different TPH that clears the 
transaction (‘‘Clearing Give-Up’’), the 
ORF is assessed to the Executing 
Clearing Firm (the ORF is the obligation 
of the Executing Clearing Firm). The 
ORF is collected from the Clearing Give- 
Up. 
3. If the Executing Clearing Firm is a 
non-TPH and the Clearing Give-up is a 
TPH, the ORF is assessed to and 
collected from the Clearing Give-up. 
4. If a TPH is the Executing Clearing 
Firm and a non-TPH is the Clearing 
Give-up, the ORF is assessed to the 
Executing Clearing Firm. The ORF is the 
obligation of the Executing Clearing 
Firm but is collected from the non-TPH 
Clearing Give-up (for the reasons 
described below). 
5. No ORF is assessed if a TPH is 
neither the Executing Clearing Firm nor 
the Clearing Give-up. 
The Exchange uses an OCC cleared 
trades file to determine the Executing 
Clearing Firm and the Clearing Give- 
up.
6
 
In each of scenarios 1 through 4 
above, if the transaction is transferred 
pursuant to a Clearing Member Trade 
Assignment (‘‘CMTA’’) agreement to 
another clearing firm who ultimately 
clears the transaction, the ORF is 
collected from the clearing firm that 
ultimately clears the transaction (which 
firm may be a non-TPH) by OCC on 
behalf of the Exchange. Using CMTA 
transfer information provided by the 
OCC, the Exchange subtracts the ORF 
charge from the monthly ORF bill of the 
clearing firm that transfers the position 
and adds the charge to the monthly ORF 
bill of the clearing firm that receives the 
CMTA transfer (i.e., the ultimate clearing firm).
7
This process is 
performed at the end of each month on 
each transfer in the OCC CMTA transfer 
file for that month.
8
 
ORF is collected by OCC on behalf of 
the Exchange from the CTPH or non- 
TPH OCC Clearing Member that 
ultimately clears the transaction. While 
the ORF is an obligation of the 
Executing Clearing Firm, the ORF is 
collected from the clearing firm that 
ultimately clears the eligible trade, even 
if such firm is not a TPH. The Exchange 
and OCC adopted this collection 
method in response to industry 
feedback that it would allow TPHs and 
non-TPHs to more easily pass-through 
the ORF to their customers. In its 
original ORF filing,
9
the Exchange 
stated that it expected TPHs to pass- 
through the ORF to their customers in 
the same manner that firms pass- 
through to their customers the fees 
charged by self-regulatory organizations 
(‘‘SROs’’) to help the SROs meet their 
obligations under Section 31 of the 
Exchange Act (and the Exchange 
understands this to be the case 
currently). Accordingly, in scenario 4 
above, the ORF is collected from the 
non-TPH OCC Clearing Member that 
clears the transaction in order to 
facilitate the pass-through of the ORF to 
the end-customer. Likewise, collection 
of the ORF from the ultimate (CMTA) 
clearing firm facilitates the passing the 
fee through to the end-customer. In 
those cases where the ORF is collected 
from a non-TPH OCC Clearing Member, 
the Exchange (through OCC) collects the 
ORF as a convenience for the CTPH 
whose obligation it is to pay the fee to 
the Exchange. 
ORF Revenue and Monitoring of ORF 
Today, revenue generated from ORF, 
when combined with all of the 
Exchange’s other regulatory fees and

tkelley on LAP7H3WLY3PROD with NOTICES59901 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 243 / Monday, December 22, 2025 / Notices 10
These expectations are estimated and may be 
subject to change. Currently, under the current rate 
temporarily increased rate, Cboe Options forecasts 
for 2026 to collect closer approximately 70% of 
total regulatory costs from ORF. 
11
See supra note 2. 
12
Under the current methodology for assessing 
ORF, the Exchange on which the transaction 
occurred is irrelevant. 
13
The Exchange originally planned to exclude all 
CMTAs whether reported to the Exchange or 
directly to the OCC. If CMTAs are excluded, the 
Exchange would only collect ORF from its TPHs 
and ORF would no longer be collected from non- 
TPHs. The Exchange continues to believe that a 
new ORF model should be assessed to TPHs only, 
but also understands the desire for a uniform 
approach to the assessment and collection of ORF 
across all options exchanges. As of filing 6 
exchanges have also filed to assess and collect ORF 
to transactions occurring on their respective 
exchanges (see Securities Exchange Act Releases No. 103103 (May 22, 2025), 90 FR 22797 (May 29, 
2025) (SR–MRX–2025–11) as amended by No. 
103618 (August 1, 2025), 90 FR 37910 (August 6, 
2025) (SR–MRX–2025–15); No. 103558 (July 28, 
2025), 90 FR 36080 (July 31, 2025) (SR–ISE–2025– 
20); No. 103559 (July 28, 2025), 90 FR 36074 (July 
31, 2025) (SR–BX–2025–012); No. 103617 (August 
1, 2025), 90 FR 37912 (August 6, 2025)(SR–GEMX– 
2025–17); No. 103619 (August 1, 2025), 90 FR 
37931 (August 6, 2025) (SR–NASDAQ–2025–054); 
No. 103620 (August 1, 2025), 90 FR 37918 (August 
8, 2025) (SR–Phlx–2025–30)). As proposed, these 
filings also will consider CMTAs reported to the 
respective exchange and not CMTAs reported 
directly to OCC. 
14
The Exchange estimates it will take 
approximately three months to implement the 
system changes associated with On-Exchange ORF. 
15
Depending on the operative date for the filing, 
the Exchange will submit an additional filing to 
specify the ORF rate based on the then-current 
estimates for regulatory revenues, regulatory costs 
and Customer volume. 
16
Direct expenses include in-house and third- 
party service provider costs to support the day-to- 
day regulatory work such as surveillances, 
investigations, and examinations.

Indirect expenses include support from areas 
such as human resources, legal, compliance, 
information technology, facilities and accounting.

surveillances, investigations, 
examinations, financial monitoring, and

enforcement activities. Regulatory costs 
include direct regulatory expenses and 
certain indirect expenses for work 
allocated in support of the regulatory 
function. The direct expenses include 
in-house and third-party service

indirect expenses include support to the 
regulatory function from such areas as 
human resources, legal, compliance, 
information technology, facilities and 
accounting. Today, these indirect 
expenses are estimated to be 
approximately 42% of the Exchange’s 
total regulatory costs for 2026. Thus, 
direct expenses are estimated to be 
approximately 58% of total regulatory 
costs for 2026. In addition, based on the 
Exchange’s analysis of its regulatory 
work associated with options regulation, 
and considering other regulatory 
revenue, it is the Exchange’s practice 
that revenue generated from ORF not 
exceed more than 75% of total annual 
regulatory costs.

Proposal for On-Exchange ORF 
Cboe Options appreciates the evolving 
changes in the market and regulatory 
environment and has been evaluating its 
current methodologies and practices for 
the assessment and collection of ORF 
while considering industry and 
Commission feedback. As a result of this 
review, the Exchange is proposing the 
On-Exchange ORF, which assesses a 
regulatory fee to only Exchange 
transactions that would clear in the 
Customer range at OCC (as is the case 
today).
11
The following scenarios reflect 
how the On-Exchange ORF will be 
assessed and collected: 
1. If a TPH is the Executing Clearing 
Firm on a transaction that occurred on 
the Exchange, the fee would be assessed 
to and collected from that CTPH by OCC 
on behalf of the Exchange. 
2. If a TPH is the Executing Clearing 
Firm and the transaction is ‘‘given up’’ 
to a Clearing Give-Up, the On-Exchange 
ORF is assessed to the Executing 
Clearing Firm (the On-Exchange ORF 
remains the obligation of the Executing 
Clearing Firm under the proposal), but 
the On-Exchange ORF will be collected 
from the Clearing Give-Up. 
The Exchange expects to provide 
CTPHs sufficient information in 
connection with their invoice in order 
to reconcile charges associated with 
ORF. In addition, the proposed method 
for collecting On-Exchange ORF will 
only consider CMTAs reported to the 
Exchange and not those reported 
directly to OCC. As described above, 
today’s ORF is the responsibility of the 
Executing Clearing Firm and collected 
from the CMTA (which may be a non- 
TPH) as an administrative convenience. 
The Exchange understands that a CMTA 
may be added at order entry, via post- 
trade edit on the Exchange, or post-trade 
at OCC. CMTA transfers that occur at 
OCC do not necessarily contain reliable 
information regarding the Exchange on 
which the original transaction 
occurred.
12
Without specific 
information as to where the original 
transaction occurred, the Exchange 
would not be able to accurately account 
for CMTA transfers that occur at OCC. 
Therefore, the Exchange will only 
account for CMTAs that occur on the 
Exchange (which may be a non-TPH) 
and exclude CMTAs occurring at 
OCC.
13
 
With this proposal, the Exchange 
intends to collect ORF under its current 
methodology for assessment and 
collection of ORF until at least June 30, 
2026. The Exchange is prepared to 
implement On-Exchange ORF effective 
July 1, 2026 if by April 1, 2026 all U.S. 
options exchanges charging an ORF 
have filed to modify their current 
methodologies of assessment of the fee 
to limit the fee to transactions occurring 
on their respective exchange.
14
 
However, if all other options exchanges 
have not filed to adopt a similar 
methodology by April 1, the Exchange 
will delay implementation 
commensurate with the additional time 
required for other options exchanges to 
adopt a similar method for collection 
and assessment of ORF. The Exchange 
will at that time file a separate rule 
filing with the amount of the On- 
Exchange ORF in advance of assessing 
and collecting the fee under the 
proposed method. The Exchange will 
provide at least 30 days’ notice of the 
applicable On-Exchange ORF rate. The 
Exchange believes a fee to recover a 
material portion of costs for regulatory 
programs associated with TPH customer 
business is reasonable; however, the 
Exchange would consider alternative 
approaches for assessment and 
collection of the fee in order to achieve 
consistency across the industry. 
To demonstrate the impact of the 
proposed change, the Exchange 
estimates that, if the On-Exchange ORF 
went into effect today, the current ORF 
of $0.0023 per contract side would 
increase to $0.01331 per contract side 
using 2026 estimates for regulatory 
revenue, regulatory costs and customer 
volume.
15
As is the case today, revenue 
generated from On-Exchange ORF, 
when combined with all of the 
Exchange’s other regulatory fees and 
fines, is designed to recover a material 
portion of the regulatory costs to the 
Exchange of the supervision and 
regulation of TPH customer options 
business, including performing routine 
surveillances, investigations, 
examinations, financial monitoring, and 
policy, rulemaking, interpretive, and 
enforcement activities. As discussed 
above, regulatory costs include direct 
regulatory expenses
16
and certain 
indirect expenses in support of the 
regulatory function.
17
Indirect expenses 
are estimated to be approximately 42% 
of the Exchange’s total regulatory costs 
for 2026. Thus, direct expenses are

estimated to be approximately 58% of 
total regulatory costs for 2026. 
The Exchange will continue to 
monitor the amount of revenue 
collected from On-Exchange ORF to 
ensure that it, in combination with its 
other regulatory fees and fines, does not 
exceed the Exchange’s total regulatory 
costs. Further, Cboe Options expects to 
continue its current practice that 
revenue generated from On-Exchange 
ORF not exceed 75% of total annual 
regulatory costs. And as is the 
Exchange’s practice today, revenue 
generated by On-Exchange ORF will not 
be used for non-regulatory purposes. 
The Exchange will continue to 
monitor its regulatory costs and 
revenues at a minimum on a semi- 
annual basis. If the Exchange 
determines regulatory revenues exceed 
or are insufficient to cover a material 
portion of its regulatory costs in a given 
year, the Exchange will adjust the On- 
Exchange ORF by submitting a fee 
change filing to the Commission. The 
Exchange will notify TPHs of 
adjustments to the On-Exchange ORF 
via an Exchange Notice in advance of 
any change.
18
 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’) and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
19
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) 
of the Act,
20
which provides that 
Exchange rules may provide for the 
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees, and other charges among its TPHs 
and other persons using its facilities. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
21
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
change to assess and collect an On- 
Exchange ORF is reasonable, equitable 
and not unfairly discriminatory for 
various reasons. First, On-Exchange 
ORF is reasonable, equitable and not 
unfairly discriminatory in that it is 
charged to all Exchange transactions 
that clear in the Customer range at the 
OCC. Similar to ORF today, the 
Exchange believes On-Exchange ORF 
ensures fairness by assessing a specific 
fee to those TPHs that require more 
Exchange regulatory services based on 
the amount of customer options 
business they conduct. Over recent 
years, options trading volume has 
increased with a growing percentage of 
the volume applicable to customer 
transactions. Customers trading on the 
Exchange (through a TPH) benefit from 
the protections of a robust regulatory 
program including the maintenance of 
fair and orderly markets and protections 
against fraud and other manipulation. 
The Exchange believes it is equitable 
and not unfairly discriminatory to 
assess a regulatory fee to transactions 
that clear in the Customer range to cover 
regulatory costs, but not to transactions 
clearing in the Firm or Market Maker 
range because CTPHs and Market Maker 
TPHs (who clear in the Firm and Market 
Maker range), as those market 
participants are generally subject to 
other Exchange fees, fines and 
obligations. For example, CTPHs and 
Market Maker TPHs are required to pay 
Exchange application fees, permit fees, 
and connectivity fees, amongst others. 
In addition, all fines issued by the 
Exchange for regulatory infractions are 
assessed only to TPHs and would be 
applied to regulatory revenues. As with 
today’s ORF, the Exchange expects that 
CTPHs from whom On-Exchange ORF is 
collected will pass through the fee to 
their customers (as the Exchange 
understands occurs today). In addition, 
Market Makers in particular are subject 
to various quoting and other obligations 
to ensure that they provide stable and 
liquid markets, which benefit all market 
participants including customers. 
Excluding Market Maker transactions 
from On-Exchange ORF will allow 
Market Makers to better manage their 
costs more effectively thus enabling 
them to better allocate resources toward 
technology, risk management, and 
capacity to ensure continued liquidity 
provision. 
In addition to the overall increase in 
Customer-range volume generally, 
regulating customer trading activity is 
more labor intensive and requires 
greater expenditure of human and 
technical resources than regulating non- 
customer trading activity, which tends 
to be more automated and less labor- 
intensive. For example, there are costs 
associated with main office and branch 
office examinations (e.g., staff and travel expenses), as well as investigations into 
customer complaints and terminations 
of Registered Persons. As a result, the 
costs associated with administering the 
customer component of the Exchange’s 
overall regulatory program are 
materially higher than the costs 
associated with administering the non- 
customer component (e.g., CTPH proprietary transactions) of its 
regulatory program.
22
While the 
Exchange notes that it has broad 
regulatory responsibilities with respect 
to its TPHs’ activities, irrespective of 
where their transactions take place, the 
Exchange believes it is reasonable to 
assess the proposed fee to only those 
transactions occurring on the Exchange. 
The proposed change more narrowly 
tailors the fee to products and 
transactions with a direct connection to 
the Exchange. Today, a customer 
transaction may be assessed an ORF 
from every options exchange totaling as 
much as $0.0187 per transaction per 
side.
23
While the Exchange’s proposed 
ORF rate under the proposed model of 
$0.01331 is higher than its current ORF 
rate of $0.0023 under the current model, 
if all exchanges adopted a similar on- 
exchange model, ORF rates may 
decrease for individual transactions 
overall because the proposed On- 
Exchange ORF will avoid overlapping 
ORFs that would otherwise be assessed 
by Cboe Options and other options 
exchanges that also assess an ORF. With 
this proposal, transactions that would 
clear in the Customer range occurring 
on other exchanges would no longer be 
subject to an ORF assessed by Cboe 
Options. 
The Exchange believes it is equitable 
and not unduly discriminatory to 
modify the method of collecting the fee 
such that On-Exchange ORF will not 
consider CMTAs reported directly to 
OCC as is done in today’s method of 
ORF. CMTA transfers are considered 
today under the current collection 
methodology for ORF as a convenience 
to industry members in administering a 
pass through of the fee to their 
customers. Limiting the On-Exchange 
ORF to transactions on the Exchange 
poses a limitation in the use of CMTA 
for this purpose. The Exchange 
understands that a CMTA may be added 
at order entry, via post-trade edit on the 
Exchange, or post-trade at OCC. CMTA 
transfers that occur at OCC do not 
necessarily contain reliable information 
regarding the Exchange on which the 
original transaction occurred.

Consistent with Rule 2.2 (Regulatory Revenue), 
the Exchange notes that should excess ORF revenue 
be collected prior to any reduction in an ORF rate, 
such excess revenue will not be used for 
nonregulatory purposes.

original transaction occurred, the 
Exchange would not be able to 
accurately account for CMTA transfers 
that occur at OCC. 
The Exchange also believes that the 
fact that a Consolidated Audit Trail 
(‘‘CAT’’) fee is in place should not 
preclude the Exchange from assessing 
On-Exchange ORF. The CAT is a 
repository of order, trade and customer 
information that is used as the basis for 
an audit trail of such activities. Like 
industry members, the exchanges, 
including Cboe Options, also pays a 
CAT fee to support the operation and 
maintenance of CAT (in other words, it 
does not support regulatory work 
undertaken by exchanges). Cboe 
Options does not include fees it pays for 
CAT in the regulatory expenses it looks 
to offset under ORF. Yes, the Exchange 
uses CAT data as part of its regulatory 
work, but only from an audit trail 
perspective. On-Exchange ORF, on the 
other hand, offsets the regulatory work 
the Exchange performs (using CAT data 
among other sources) such as 
surveillances, investigations, 
examinations, etc. The Exchange 
believes its fair and reasonable to assess 
an On-Exchange ORF in addition to fees 
associated with CAT. 
The Exchange further believes that the 
proposed change to the method for 
assessment and collection of the fee is 
reasonable because it would help ensure 
that revenue collected from the On- 
Exchange ORF, in combination with 
other regulatory fees and fines, would 
help offset, but not exceed, the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. As 
discussed, On-Exchange ORF is 
similarly designed to the current ORF, 
in that revenues generated from the fee 
would be less than or equal to 75% of 
the Exchange’s regulatory costs, which 
is consistent with the practice across the 
options industry today and the view of 
the Commission that regulatory fees be 
used for regulatory purposes and not to 
support the Exchange’s business side. 
As noted above, the Exchange will 
also continue to monitor on at least a 
semi-annual basis the amount of 
revenue collected from the On-Exchange 
ORF, even as amended, to ensure that it, 
in combination with its other regulatory 
fees and fines, does not exceed the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. If the 
Exchange determines regulatory 
revenues would exceed its regulatory 
costs in a given year, the Exchange will 
reduce the On-Exchange ORF by 
submitting a fee change filing to the 
Commission.
25
 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. This 
proposal does not create an unnecessary 
or inappropriate intra-market burden on 
competition because On-Exchange ORF 
applies to all customer activity on the 
Exchange, thereby raising regulatory 
revenue to offset regulatory expenses. It 
also supplements the regulatory revenue 
derived from non-customer activity. The 
Exchange notes, however, the proposed 
change is not designed to address any 
competitive issues. Indeed, this 
proposal does not create an unnecessary 
or inappropriate inter-market burden on 
competition because it is a regulatory 
fee that supports regulation in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
The Exchange is obligated to ensure that 
the amount of regulatory revenue 
collected from the On-Exchange ORF, in 
combination with its other regulatory 
fees and fines, does not exceed 
regulatory costs. In addition, the 
Exchange will not implement the On- 
Exchange ORF until all other options 
exchanges are prepared to adopt a 
similar model to avoid overlapping 
ORFs. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received written comments on the 
proposed rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) 
of the Act
26
and paragraph (f) of Rule 
19b–4
27
thereunder. At any time within 
60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved.

places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set

the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to extend the 
sunset date of the current Options 
Regulatory Fee (‘‘ORF’’) from December 
31, 2025 to June 30, 2026. Therefore, as 
proposed, ORF will continue to be 
$0.0023 per contract side, effective 
January 2, 2026. 
Background 
Today, ORF is assessed by the 
Exchange to each Trading Permit Holder 
(‘‘TPH’’) for options transactions cleared 
by the TPH that are cleared by the 
Options Clearing Corporation (‘‘OCC’’) 
in the customer range, regardless of the 
exchange on which the transaction 
occurs.
3
In other words, the Exchange 
imposes the ORF on all customer-range 
transactions cleared by a TPH, even if 
the transactions do not take place on the 
Exchange. The ORF is collected by OCC 
on behalf of the Exchange from the 
Clearing Trading Permit Holder 
(‘‘CTPH’’) or non-CTPH that ultimately 
clears the transaction. With respect to 
linkage transactions, the Exchange 
reimburses its routing broker providing 
Routing Services pursuant to the 
Exchange Rule 5.36 for options 
regulatory fees it incurs in connection 
with the Routing Services it provides. 
Revenue generated from ORF, when 
combined with all of the Exchange’s 
other regulatory fees and fines, is 
designed to recover a material portion of 
the regulatory costs to the Exchange of 
the supervision and regulation of TPH 
customer options business including 
performing routine surveillances, 
investigations, examinations, financial 
monitoring, and policy, rulemaking, 
interpretive, and enforcement activities. 
Regulatory costs include direct 
regulatory expenses and certain indirect 
expenses for work allocated in support 
of the regulatory function. The direct 
expenses include in-house and third- 
party service provider costs to support 
the day-to-day regulatory work such as 
surveillances, investigations and 
examinations. The indirect expenses 
include support from such areas as 
human resources, legal, compliance, 
information technology, facilities and 
accounting. These indirect expenses are 
estimated to be approximately 42% of 
the Exchange’ total regulatory costs for 
2026. Thus, direct expenses are 
estimated to be approximately 58% of 
total regulatory costs for 2026. In 
addition, based on the Exchange’ 
analysis of its regulatory work 
associated with options regulation, and 
considering other regulatory revenue, it 
is the Exchange’s practice that revenue 
generated from ORF not exceed more 
than 75% of total annual regulatory 
costs. These expectations are estimated, 
preliminary and may be subject to 
change. If the ORF rate were to revert 
back to $0.0017 per contract side as of 
January 2, 2026, the Exchange would 
collect significantly lower than the 75% 
threshold. Under that reverted rate, the 
Exchange forecasts for 2026 to collect 
closer to 54%.
4
 
Proposal for January 2, 2026 
The Exchange monitors its regulatory 
costs and revenues at a minimum on a 
semi-annual basis. If the Exchange 
determines regulatory revenues exceed 
or are insufficient to cover a material 
portion of its regulatory costs in a given 
year, the Exchange will adjust the ORF 
by submitting a fee change filing to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ‘‘Commission’’). Even with the 
temporary increase in 2025, the 
Exchange collected approximately 71% 
of its annual regulatory costs. 
The Exchange also notifies TPHs of 
adjustments to the ORF via an Exchange 
Notice, including for the change being 
proposed herein.
5
Based on the 
Exchange’s most recent semi-annual 
review, the Exchange is proposing to 
maintain the ORF rate of $0.0023 per 
contract side.
6
The proposed extension 
is based on the Exchange’s estimated 
projections for its regulatory costs, 
which projections have increased, 
coupled with a projected decrease in the 
Exchange’s other non-ORF regulatory 
fees. Particularly, based on the 
Exchange’s estimated projections for its 
regulatory costs, the revenue generated 
by ORF using the rate of $0.0017 per 
contract side (the rate to which ORF is 
set to revert after December 31, 2025), 
would result in projected revenue that 
is insufficient to cover a material 
portion of its regulatory costs (i.e., less than 75% of total annual regulatory 
costs). Further, when combined with the 
Exchange’s projected other non-ORF

See, e.g., NYSE Arca Options Fees and Charges,

$0.0026 per contract side for each respective

Consistent with Rule 2.2 (Regulatory Revenue), 
the Exchange notes that should excess ORF revenue 
be collected prior to any reduction in an ORF rate, 
such excess revenue will not be used for 
nonregulatory purposes. 
is projected to result in combined 
revenue that is less than 100% of the 
Exchange’s estimated regulatory costs 
for the year. As noted above, even with 
the extension of the sunset date for the 
temporarily increased rate, the amount 
collected by the Exchange will be lower 
than the 75% threshold. As the 
Exchange has done in the past, the 
Exchange will also provide the 
Commission confidential details 
regarding the Exchange’s projected 
regulatory revenue, including projected 
revenue from ORF, along with a 
breakout of its projected regulatory 
expenses, including both direct and 
indirect allocations. 
The Exchange will continue to 
monitor the amount of revenue 
collected from the ORF to ensure that it, 
in combination with its other regulatory 
fees and fines, does not exceed the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. 
New ORF Model 
The Exchange appreciates the 
evolving changes in the markets and 
regulatory environment and has been 
evaluating its options while considering 
industry and regulatory feedback. In 
light of this, the Exchange has been 
reviewing its current methodologies and 
practices for the assessment and 
collection of ORF. As a result of this 
review, the Exchange is submitting 
contemporaneously with this filing 
another filing that proposes to adopt a 
modified ORF model that updates the 
Exchange’s process of assessing and 
collecting ORF, in which model ORF 
would be assessed to only on-Exchange 
transactions that clear in the customer 
range at OCC. Under the proposed 
modified model, the Exchange expects 
to continue its current practice that 
revenue generated from ORF not exceed 
75% of total annual regulatory costs. 
And as is the Exchange’s practice today, 
revenue generated by ORF will not be 
used for nonregulatory purposes. 
To create real ORF reform, moving to 
a new ORF model that only assesses a 
fee to transactions that occur on one’s 
own options exchange seems right. 
However, for a new, modified model to 
be truly meaningful and fair, a rate 
limited to transactions on one’s own 
exchange should be adopted by all 
options exchanges to provide a 
consistent methodology in assessing and 
collecting ORF going forward. As set 
forth in its separate filing that proposes 
the new, modified ORF model, the 
Exchange is committed to switching to 
this new model as soon as a consistent 
framework has been established with 
the SEC, adopted by all the options 
exchanges and necessary regulatory 
filings submitted. Until that time, the 
Exchange believes it’s fair and 
reasonable to maintain the temporarily 
higher rate under the existing model. 
In light of the Exchange’s pending 
proposal to revamp ORF, the Exchange 
proposes to extend the current sunset 
date of December 31, 2025 for the 
current rate of $0.0023 per contract side 
to June 30, 2026, at which point the 
Exchange would revert back to $0.0017 
per contract side. The proposed sunset 
date will provide time for establishment 
of one new, unified model going 
forward. The Exchange will endeavor to 
implement the modified ORF structure 
prior to the proposed June 30, 2026 
sunset date. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’) and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
7
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) 
of the Act,
8
which provides that 
Exchange rules may provide for the 
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees, and other charges among its TPHs 
and other persons using its facilities. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
9
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
extended sunset date is reasonable 
because it would help ensure that 
revenue collected from the ORF, in 
combination with other regulatory fees 
and fines, would help offset, but not 
exceed, the Exchange’s total regulatory 
costs. As discussed, the Exchange has 
designed the ORF to generate revenues 
that would be less than or equal to 75% 
of the Exchange’s regulatory costs, 
which is consistent with the practice 
across the options industry and the view 
of the Commission that regulatory fees 
be used for regulatory purposes and not 
to support the Exchange’s business side. 
The Exchange determined to maintain 
the temporarily increased ORF rate after 
its semi-annual review of its regulatory 
costs and regulatory revenues, which 
includes revenues from ORF and other 
regulatory fees and fines. When taking 
into account recent options volume, 
coupled with the anticipated regulatory 
fees and anticipated reductions in other 
regulatory fees, the Exchange believes 
it’s reasonable to maintain the 
temporarily increased ORF rate. 
Particularly, the proposed change is 
reasonable as it would offset the 
anticipated increased regulatory costs, 
while still not exceeding 75% of the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. 
Moreover, the current, temporarily 
raised rate is still lower than the amount 
of ORF assessed on other exchanges
10
 
and significantly lower than the 
Exchange has assessed previously.
11
 
As noted above, the Exchange will 
also continue to monitor on at least a 
semi-annual basis the amount of 
revenue collected from the ORF, even as 
amended, to ensure that it, in 
combination with its other regulatory 
fees and fines, does not exceed the 
Exchange’s total regulatory costs. If the 
Exchange determines regulatory 
revenues would exceed its regulatory 
costs in a given year, the Exchange will 
reduce the ORF by submitting a fee 
change filing to the Commission.
12
 
The Exchange also believes the 
proposed change is equitable and not 
unfairly discriminatory in that it is 
charged to all TPHs on all their 
transactions that clear in the customer 
range at the OCC through the extended 
sunset date. The Exchange believes the 
ORF ensures fairness by assessing 
higher fees to those TPHs that require 
more Exchange regulatory services 
based on the amount of customer 
options business they conduct. 
Regulating customer trading activity is 
much more labor intensive and requires 
greater expenditure of human and 
technical resources than regulating non- 
customer trading activity, which tends 
to be more automated and less labor- 
intensive. For example, there are costs 
associated with main office and branch 
office examinations (e.g., staff and travel expenses), as well as investigations into 
customer complaints and the 
terminations of registered persons. As a 
result, the costs associated with 
administering the customer component 
of the Exchange’s overall regulatory

If the Exchange changes its method of funding 
regulation or if circumstances otherwise change in 
the future, the Exchange may decide to modify the 
ORF or assess a separate regulatory fee on TPH 
proprietary transactions if the Exchange deems it 
advisable. 
14
ISG is an industry organization formed in 1983 
to coordinate intermarket surveillance among the 
SROs by cooperatively sharing regulatory 
information pursuant to a written agreement 
between the parties. The goal of the ISG’s 
information sharing is to coordinate regulatory 
efforts to address potential intermarket trading 
abuses and manipulations.

program are materially higher than the 
costs associated with administering the 
non-customer component (e.g., TPH proprietary transactions) of its 
regulatory program.
13
Moreover, the 
Exchange notes that it has broad 
regulatory responsibilities with respect 
to its TPHs’ activities, irrespective of 
where their transactions take place. 
Many of the Exchange’s surveillance 
programs for customer trading activity 
may require the Exchange to look at 
activity across all markets, such as 
reviews related to position limit 
violations and manipulation. Indeed, 
the Exchange cannot effectively review 
for such conduct without looking at and 
evaluating activity regardless of where it 
transpires. In addition to its own 
surveillance programs, the Exchange 
also works with other SROs and 
exchanges on intermarket surveillance 
related issues. Through its participation 
in the Intermarket Surveillance Group 
(‘‘ISG’’),
14
the Exchange shares 
information and coordinates inquiries 
and investigations with other exchanges 
designed to address potential 
intermarket manipulation and trading 
abuses. Accordingly, there is a strong 
nexus between the ORF and the 
Exchange’s regulatory activities with 
respect to its TPHs’ customer trading 
activity. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. This 
proposal does not create an unnecessary 
or inappropriate intramarket burden on 
competition because ORF applies to all 
customer activity, thereby raising 
regulatory revenue to offset regulatory 
expenses. It also supplements the 
regulatory revenue derived from 
noncustomer activity. The Exchange 
notes, however, the proposed change is 
not designed to address any competitive 
issues. Indeed, this proposal does not 
create an unnecessary or inappropriate 
intermarket burden on competition 
because it is a regulatory fee that 
supports regulation in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. The Exchange is 
obligated to ensure that the amount of 
regulatory revenue collected from the 
ORF, in combination with its other 
regulatory fees and fines, does not 
exceed regulatory costs. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received written comments on the 
proposed rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) 
of the Act
15
and paragraph (f) of Rule 
19b–4
16
thereunder. At any time within 
60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Rules 5.37 (Automated Price 
Improvement Mechanism (‘‘AIM’’ or 
‘‘AIM Auction’’)), 5.39 (‘‘Solicitation 
Auction Mechanisms (‘‘SAM’’ or ‘‘SAM 
Auction’’)), 5.73 (FLEX Automated 
Improvement Mechanism (‘‘FLEX AIM’’ 
or ‘‘FLEX AIM Auction’’)), and 5.74 
(FLEX Solicitation Auction Mechanism 
(‘‘FLEX SAM’’ or ‘‘FLEX SAM 
Auction’’)), to permit orders for the 
accounts of Market-Makers with an 
appointment in the applicable class on 
the Exchange, in all classes, to be 
solicited for the Initiating Order
3
 
submitted for execution against an 
Agency Order into a simple AIM 
Auction pursuant to Rule 5.37, a simple 
SAM Auction pursuant to Rule 5.39, a 
FLEX AIM Auction pursuant to Rule 
5.73, or a FLEX SAM Auction pursuant 
to Rule 5.74. 
By way of background, Rule 5.37 
contains the requirements applicable to 
the execution of certain customer orders 
(‘‘Agency Orders’’) using AIM. An AIM 
Auction is an electronic auction 
intended to provide an Agency Order 
with the opportunity to receive price 
improvement (over the National Best 
Bid or Offer (‘‘NBBO’’)). Rule 5.39 
contains the requirements applicable to 
the execution of Agency Orders using 
SAM. Similarly, a SAM Auction is an 
electronic auction intended to provide a 
larger-sized Agency Order with the 
opportunity to receive price 
improvement over the NBBO. Upon 
submitting an Agency Order into an 
AIM or SAM Auction, the initiating 
Trading Permit Holder (‘‘Initiating 
TPH’’) must also submit a contra-side 
second order (‘‘Initiating Order’’) for the 
same size as the Agency Order. The 
Initiating Order guarantees that the 
Agency Order will receive an execution 
at no worse than the auction price. 
Upon commencement of an auction, 
market participants may submit 
responses to trade against the Agency 
Order.
4
At the conclusion of an AIM 
Auction, depending on the contra-side 
interest (including auction responses) 
available, the Initiating Order may be 
allocated a certain percentage (or more) 
of the Agency Order.
5
At the conclusion 
of a SAM Auction, depending on the 
contra-side interest (including auction 
responses) available, the Initiating Order 
may be allocated the entire Agency 
Order or none of the Agency Order.
6
 
Rules 5.73 and 5.74 contain the 
requirements for AIM and SAM 
Auctions for flexible exchange options 
(‘‘FLEX Options’’) (‘‘FLEX AIM’’ and 
‘‘FLEX SAM,’’ respectively). 
Currently, the introductory 
paragraphs of Rules 5.37 and 5.73 
prohibit orders for the accounts of 
Market-Makers with an appointment in 
the applicable class on the Exchange in 
all classes except S&P 500 Index options 
(‘‘SPX’’) to be solicited to execute 
against the Agency Order in a simple 
AIM or FLEX AIM Auction, 
respectively. The introductory 
paragraphs of Rules 5.39 and 5.73 
prohibit orders for the accounts of 
Market-Makers with an appointment in 
the applicable class on the Exchange to 
be solicited to execute against the 
Agency Order in a simple SAM or FLEX 
SAM Auction, respectively. 
While market participants other than 
appointed Market-Makers may 
contribute liquidity to these crossing 
auctions as either contra orders or 
responses, appointed Market-Makers, 
who are the primary source of liquidity 
on the Exchange in their appointed 
classes, are limited in the manner in 
which they may provide liquidity to 
these auctions. Given that contra orders 
that comprise Initiating Orders may be 
allocated a percentage of the Agency 
Order at the conclusion of the auctions, 
the limited ability of appointed Market- 
Makers to participate in simple AIM, 
simple SAM, FLEX AIM, and FLEX 
SAM Auctions may reduce the 
execution opportunities for these 
liquidity providers, which execution 
opportunities are available to other 
market participants who may be 
solicited or submit responses. 
The Exchange believes that 
eliminating the prohibition against 
appointed Market-Makers acting as 
contra in single-leg AIM orders would 
enhance price improvement 
opportunities, particularly for retail and 
smaller Customer orders. This is 
especially relevant in proprietary 
products like VIX options, for which 
many AIM orders are large-sized 
transactions with banks or institutional 
participants as contras, while retail 
orders often route directly to the Book 
without the opportunity for potential 
price improvement via AIM auctions. 
Allowing local appointed Market- 
Makers to be solicited as contras may 
result in exposure of more small 
customer orders to potential price 
improvement via auction processes. The 
Exchange notes that appointed Market- 
Makers may be solicited as contras for 
complex AIM and SAM Auctions, 
which function in a substantially 
similar manner as AIM and SAM for 
simple orders.
7
The Exchange further 
notes that Rule 8.10 prohibits TPHs 
from misusing material, nonpublic 
information (for example, advanced 
knowledge of auctioned orders), so 
protections will remain in place under 
the proposed rule change to address any 
potential information leakage concerns. 
Additionally, the restriction has 
become operationally outdated in 
current market structure. As noted 
above, it is common practice that AIM 
orders already involve the same Market- 
Maker firm acting as both contra (via an 
away Market-Maker) and auction 
respondent (via an appointed Market- 
Maker). Eliminating this restriction 
would reduce an arbitrary and

unnecessary burden allow Market- 
Maker firms to structure more efficient 
auction processes, which may 
ultimately promote greater competition 
among Market-Makers and provide 
Customers with enhanced opportunities 
for price improvement. 
To demonstrate the importance of the 
liquidity provided by Market-Makers, 
for the time period from January to June 
2025, the percentage of smaller 
Customer orders (20 or fewer) that 
executed in open outcry against a 
Market-Maker in multi-list classes as 
contra was approximately 57%, and the 
percentage of smaller customer orders 
(20 or fewer) that executed 
electronically against a Market-Maker in 
multi-list classes as contra was 
approximately 93%. Further, for the 
same time period, the percentage of 
smaller Customer orders (20 or fewer) 
that executed in open outcry against a 
VIX Market-Maker as contra was 
approximately 71%, and the percentage 
of smaller customer orders (20 or fewer) 
that executed electronically against a 
Market-Maker in multi-list classes as 
contra was approximately 87%. 
Currently, there are 24 distinct TPHs 
with appointments across multi-list 
classes and 18 TPHs with VIX 
appointments, which represent a 
significant pool of liquidity that would 
be available to participate in AIM 
Auctions through both contra orders 
and auction responses. 
The Exchange is proposing to amend 
Rules 5.37, 5.39, 5.73, and 5.74 to 
permit orders for the accounts of 
Market-Makers with an appointment in 
the applicable class to be solicited for 
the Initiating Order submitted for 
execution against an Agency Order in 
all classes into a simple AIM Auction 
pursuant to Rule 5.37, a simple SAM 
Auction pursuant to Rule 5.39, a FLEX 
AIM Auction pursuant to Rule 5.73, or 
a FLEX SAM Auction pursuant to Rule 
5.74. The Exchange believes providing 
appointed Market-Makers with an 
additional way to participate in 
electronic auctions will expand 
available liquidity for these auctions, 
which may increase execution and price 
improvement opportunities for 
customers’ orders. No similar restriction 
applies to crossing transactions in open 
outcry trading.
8
Brokers seeking 
liquidity to execute against customer 
orders on the trading floor regularly 
solicit appointed Market-Makers in the 
applicable class for this liquidity, as 
they are generally the primary source of 
liquidity in a class (as noted above). 
Therefore, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change will further align 
open outcry and electronic crossing 
auctions and the execution and price 
improvement opportunities available in 
both auctions by permitting the same 
participants to be solicited as contras in 
AIM, SAM, FLEX AIM, and FLEX SAM 
Auctions across all classes at all times. 
The Exchange notes the electronic 
crossing price improvement auction of 
another options exchange currently 
permits orders for the accounts of 
appointed market-makers to be solicited 
as the contra orders for that auction.
9
 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’) and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
10
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5)
11
requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged 
in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, 
and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
12
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
In particular, the Exchange believes 
the proposed rule change will promote 
just and equitable principles of trade 
and remove impediments to and perfect 
the mechanism of a free and open 
market and a national market system 
because it will provide the primary 
liquidity providers on the Exchange 
with an additional way to participate in 
electronic auctions. Additionally, by 
permitting brokers to solicit primary 
liquidity providers in a class for 
electronic auctions, the Exchange 
believes brokers will be able to more 
efficiently locate liquidity to fill their 
customer orders, particularly during 
times of volatility. As a result, the 
Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change will likely expand available 
liquidity for these auctions, which may 
create additional execution and price 
improvement opportunities for 
customers at all times, which ultimately 
benefits investors. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the Act 
because it will further align open outcry 
and electronic crossing auctions and the 
execution and price improvement 
opportunities available in both auctions 
by permitting the same participants to 
be solicited as contras in both types of 
auctions across all classes. Currently, 
appointed Market-Makers may be 
solicited with respect to crossing 
transactions on the trading floor but 
may not be solicited with respect to 
electronic crossing transactions. The 
Exchange believes there is no reason to 
restrict Market-Makers ability to provide 
liquidity into electronic auctions when 
they are able to similarly provide that 
liquidity in open outcry trading. As 
noted above, the electronic crossing 
price improvement auction of another 
options exchange currently permits 
orders for the accounts of appointed 
market-makers to be solicited as the 
contra orders for that auction.
13
 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change will promote competition in 
AIM Auctions, including competition to 
initiate AIM Auctions, which will 
remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in 
general, to protect investors. The 
Exchange believes the availability of 
this liquidity to Agency Orders will 
positively affect the experience for 
Agency Orders and overall quality of the 
auctions. Furthermore, the Exchange 
believes increasing the number of 
market participants available to be 
solicited may increase competition to 
provide Initiating Orders, which may 
lead to an AIM Auction being initiated 
at a better price. More market 
participants competing to provide 
Initiating Orders may lead to solicited 
parties providing more aggressive initial 
prices. The Exchange believes the 
ability of all market participants, 
including appointed Market-Makers that 
did not submit an Initiating Order, to 
submit responses to an AIM Auction 
will continue to provide competition for 
executions against Agency Orders. 
The Exchange believes any risk that 
appointed Market-Makers may misuse 
the nonpublic information of an

upcoming AIM Auction is de minimis. 
Currently, that risk is present for non- 
appointed Market-Makers, but the 
Exchange has not observed any trends of 
solicited market participants separately 
submitting unrelated orders as a result 
of knowledge of impending AIM 
Auctions in other classes. The Exchange 
notes Rule 5.37, Interpretation and 
Policy .02 prohibits a pattern or practice 
of submitting orders or quotes for the 
purpose of disrupting or manipulating 
AIM Auctions, and Rule 8.10 requires 
TPHs to establish, maintain, and enforce 
written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to prevent the 
misuse of material, nonpublic 
information by TPHs and their 
associated persons. Finally, the 
Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is not designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers because it 
will be permit orders for accounts of 
appointed Market-Makers to be solicited 
in the same manner as orders for the 
accounts of all other market 
participants. Currently, all market 
participants other than appointed 
Market-Makers may be solicited as the 
contra and submit responses in AIM 
Auctions for all classes. Given the 
additional costs and obligations 
associated with being an appointed 
Market-Maker, the Exchange does not 
believe these Market-Makers should 
have fewer execution opportunities with 
respect to volume submitted for 
execution through AIM auctions and not 
for electronic execution against interest 
in the book. The Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change will provide all 
Market-Makers on the Exchange with 
the same ability to participate in AIM in 
all classes at all times, which may 
further increase execution and price 
improvement opportunities for 
customers. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
Exchange does not believe the proposed 
rule change will impose any burden on 
intramarket competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act because it 
provides the same execution 
opportunities in AIM Auctions to 
appointed Market-Makers that are 
currently available to all other market 
participants. Additionally, the proposed 
rule change will further align open 
outcry and electronic crossing auctions 
and the execution and price 
improvement opportunities available in 
both auctions by permitting the same 
participants to be solicited as contras in 
auctions across all classes. 
The Exchange does not believe the 
proposed rule change will impose any 
burden on intermarket competition that 
is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act 
because it relates to orders submitted 
into auction mechanisms on the 
Exchange. Additionally, the Exchange 
notes that the rules of at least one other 
options exchange permits orders for the 
accounts of appointed market-makers to 
be solicited as contra orders for that 
exchange’s electronic crossing price 
improvement auction.
14
The Exchange 
believes the proposed rule change may 
improve price competition within AIM 
Auctions, because the primary liquidity 
providers will be able to increase 
participation in AIM Auctions. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received comments on the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action

Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to adjust 
Professional Subscriber fees for Top of 
PHLX Options, TOPO Plus Orders and 
PHLX Orders to be the same as those 
currently applicable to PHLX Depth 
Data. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/phlx/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to adjust the 
Exchange’s Professional Subscriber fees 
for Top of PHLX Options (‘‘TOPO’’), 
PHLX Orders, and TOPO Plus Orders 
for inflation.
3
 
Top of PHLX Options 
Top of PHLX Options calculates and 
disseminates the Exchange’s best bid 
and offer position, with aggregate size 
(including total size in aggregate, for 
Professional Order size in the aggregate 
and Public Customer Order size in the 
aggregate), based on displayable order 
and quote interest in the System. The 
data contained in the TOPO data feed is 
identical to the data simultaneously sent 
to the processor for the OPRA and 
subscribers of that data feed. The data 
provided for each options series 
includes the symbols (series and 
underlying security), put or call 
indicator, expiration date, the strike 
price of the series, and whether the 
option series is available for trading on 
Phlx and identifies if the series is 
available for closing transactions only.
4
 
Customers are free to purchase TOPO 
or not, and can reject the feed for any 
reason, including the fee charged. 
The monthly Professional Subscriber 
fee for TOPO is currently $40.
5
This fee 
has not changed for over a decade, since 
January 2013.
6
 
PHLX Order Feed 
Nasdaq Phlx Order Feed (‘‘Order 
Feed’’) provides pricing information on 
new orders resting on the Phlx Order 
book (e.g. price, quantity, market participant capacity and Attributable 
Order tags when provided by a 
Member). Nasdaq Phlx Order Feed is 
currently provided as part of the TOPO 
Plus Orders data product. The data 
provided for each options series 
includes the symbols (series and 
underlying security), displayed order 
types, order attributes (e.g., OCC account number, give-up information, 
CMTA information), put or call 
indicator, expiration date, the strike 
price of the series, and whether the 
option series is available for trading on 
Phlx and identifies if the series is 
available for closing transactions only. 
The feed also provides auction and 
exposure notifications and order 
imbalances on opening/reopening (size 
of matched contracts and size of the 
imbalance).
7
The Order Feed provides 
customers with the opportunity to 
reduce bandwidth (and therefore data 
processing costs) relative to the full 
depth of book feed, while retaining a 
view of market participant orders 
(setting aside symbols where 
participants have not placed orders). 
Customers are free to purchase PHLX 
Orders or not, and can reject the feed for 
any reason, including the fee charged. 
The monthly Professional Subscriber 
fee for Phlx Orders is currently $40. 
This fee has not changed in over a 
decade, since January 2013.
8
 
TOPO Plus Orders 
TOPO Plus Orders offers both TOPO 
and the Order Feed for a consolidated 
fee that is less than the combined fee for 
the two products. 
Customers are free to purchase TOPO 
Plus Orders or not, and can reject the 
feed for any reason, including the fee 
charged. 
The monthly Professional Subscriber 
fee for TOPO Plus Orders is currently 
$40. This fee has not changed since 
January 2013.
9
 
Proposed Changes 
The Exchange proposes to increase 
the Professional Subscriber Fees for 
TOPO, Orders, and TOPO Plus Orders 
for inflation. 
In January 2025, the Exchange 
proposed an inflationary adjustment to 
certain market data fees separated into 
three tranches to prevent any undue 
impact that execution in one tranche 
would have on our customers: 45 
percent in 2025; 30 percent in 2026; and 
the final 25 percent in 2027.
10
 
The Exchange proposes to replicate 
that proposal for these Professional 
Subscriber fees, using both the same 
measure of inflation and the same three 
tranche structure that became operative 
on January 1, 2025. 
As explained in that filing, the 
Exchange has continuously invested in 
its products after the current fees were 
first instituted to accommodate the 
increasing amount of information 
processed and the changes in 
technology over time. These 
investments have been necessary in part 
because of increases in the amount of 
information processed, coupled with the 
need to maintain infrastructure in a high 
fixed cost environment as system 
demand has increased over time: 
€Peak Rate by Millisecond: up approximately 40% 
€Average Rate per Millisecond: up approximately 37% 
€Peak Rate per Second: up approximately 109% 
€Average Rate per Second: up approximately 113% 
€Peak Total Messages: up approximately 477%

The Exchange notes that the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics uses a number of measures of inflation 
that may apply to Exchange market data. For 
example, there is also an inflation measure related 
to PPI industry data for data processing, hosting and 
related services: Hosting, ASP, and other IT 
infrastructure provisioning services. This other 
measure has been used by other SROs in 
determining price changes and may provide an 
alternative point of reference. 
17
The Exchange rounded fees as follows: fee 
values over $999.99 were rounded to the nearest 
$10; fees between $99.99 and $999.99 were rounded 
to the nearest dollar; fees between $9.99 and $99.99 
were rounded to the nearest $0.50; fees less than 
$9.99 were rounded to the nearest $0.10. Where 
rounding would have caused the proposed fee to 
exceed the rate of inflation, the Exchange rounded 
downward. 
18
See Supra n. 5. The change as calculated by the 
Data Processing PPI index is 12.9%. The actual 
change is 12.8% due to rounding of the fee.

Id. 
€Average Total Messages: up approximately 626% 
€Average Daily Volume: up approximately 18% 
€Maximum Message Count: up approximately 477% 
With this increase in message traffic 
and the need to maintain infrastructure, 
the Exchange expended significant 
resources to improve its market data 
products to meet customer expectations, 
including continued investment in all 
aspects of the technology ecosystem 
(e.g., software, hardware, and network). And the Exchange continues to invest in 
enhancing its technology for the benefit 
and often at the behest of its customers. 
Yet the Exchange has not adjusted any 
of the fees included in this proposal for 
many years to even partially offset the 
costs of maintaining and enhancing its 
market data offerings. 
Inflationary Index 
The fee increases the Exchange 
proposes are based on an industry- 
specific Producer Price Index (PPI), 
which is a tailored measure of 
inflation.
11
As a general matter, the 
Producer Price Index is a family of 
indexes that measure the average change 
over time in selling prices received by 
domestic producers of goods and 
services, assessing price change from 
the perspective of the seller. This 
contrasts with other metrics, such as the 
Consumer Price Index (CPI), that 
measure price change from the 
purchaser’s perspective.
12
 
About 10,000 PPIs for individual 
products and groups of products are 
tracked and released each month.
13
PPIs 
are available for the output of nearly all 
industries in the goods-producing 
sectors of the U.S. economy—mining, 
manufacturing, agriculture, fishing, and 
forestry—as well as natural gas, 
electricity, and construction, among 
others. The PPI program covers 
approximately 69 percent of the service 
sector’s output, as measured by revenue 
reported in the 2017 Economic Census. 
For purposes of this proposal, the 
relevant industry-specific PPI is the 
Data Processing and Related Services 
PPI (‘‘Data Processing PPI’’), which is an 
industry net-output PPI that measures 
the average change in selling prices 
received by companies that provide data 
processing services. The Data Processing 
PPI was introduced in January 2002 by 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) as 
part of an ongoing effort to expand 
Producer Price Index coverage of the 
services sector of the U.S. economy and 
is identified as NAICS—518210 in the 
North American Industry Classification 
System.
14
According to the BLS, ‘‘[t]he 
primary output of NAICS 518210 is the 
provision of electronic data processing 
services. In the broadest sense, 
computer services companies help their 
customers efficiently use technology. 
The processing services market consists 
of vendors who use their own computer 
systems—often utilizing proprietary 
software—to process customers’ 
transactions and data. Companies that 
offer processing services collect, 
organize, and store a customer’s 
transactions and other data for record- 
keeping purposes. Price movements for 
the NAICS 518210 index are based on 
changes in the revenue received by 
companies that provide data processing 
services. Each month, companies 
provide net transaction prices for a 
specified service. The transaction is an 
actual contract selected by probability, 
where the price-determining 
characteristics are held constant while 
the service is repriced. The prices used 
in index calculation are the actual 
prices billed for the selected service 
contract.’’
15
 
The Exchange believes the Data 
Processing PPI is an adequate measure 
to for adjusting fees for its proprietary 
market data products because the 
Exchange uses its ‘‘own computer 
systems’’ and ‘‘proprietary software,’’ 
i.e., its own data center and proprietary matching engine software, respectively, 
to collect, organize, store and report 
customers’ transactions in U.S. equity 
securities.
16
 
The Exchange furthermore notes that 
the Data Processing PPI is a stable 
metric with limited volatility, unlike 
other consumer-side inflation metrics. 
The Data Processing PPI has not 
experienced a greater than 2.16% 
increase for any one calendar year 
period since Data Processing PPI was 
introduced into the PPI in January 2002. 
The average calendar year change from 
January 2002 to December 2023 was 
0.62%, with a cumulative increase of 
15.67% over this 21-year period. 
Proposed Fee Changes 
The proposed inflationary 
adjustments are based on a comparison 
of the Data Processing PPI index on the 
last date that the relevant fee was 
adjusted with the level of the Data 
Processing PPI index on August 1, 2024. 
That percentage increase was then 
applied to the prior fee to determine the 
proposed fee, and then rounding the 
result.
17
As noted above, the Exchange 
proposes to adjust fees in three tranches: 
one in 2025 that will cover 45 percent 
of the adjustment, another in 2026 to 
cover an additional 30 percent, and a 
final tranche in 2027 for the final 25 
percent of the adjustment. Table 1 
below shows the proposed changes for 
2025, 2026 and 2027, the date of the last 
fee change, and the overall adjustment

17 CFR 200.30–3(a)(12). 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
21
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
22
in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges 
among members and issuers and other 
persons using any facility, and is not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
This is because it is reasonable and 
consistent with the Act for the Exchange 
to recoup its investments, at least in 
part, by adjusting its fees, and, as noted 
above, the Exchange has not increased 
any of these fees since 2013. In the years 
following the last fee increase, the 
Exchange has made significant 
investments in upgrades to Exchange 
systems and enhancing the quality of its 
services as measured by, among other 
things, increased throughput. As such, 
Exchange customers have benefitted 
while the Exchange’s ability to recoup 
its investments has been hampered, and 
Exchange fees have fallen in real terms 
during the relevant period. 
Between 2018 and 2023, for example, 
the overall inflation rate was an average 
of 3.93% per year, producing a 
cumulative inflation rate of 21.28%.
23
 
Using the more targeted inflation 
number of Data Processing PPI, the 
cumulative inflation rate was 8.07%.
24
 
The Exchange believes the Data 
Processing PPI is a reasonable metric for 
this fee increase because it is targeted to 
producer-side increases in the data 
processing industry, which, based on 
the definition adopted by BLS, would 
include the Exchange’s market data 
products. Notwithstanding this 
inflation, the Exchange has not 
increased its fees for the subject services 
since 2013, and therefore the proposed 
fee changes represent a reasonable 
increase from the current fees. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
fee increase is reasonable in light of the 
Exchange’s continued expenditure in 
maintaining a robust technology 
ecosystem. The Exchange continues to 
invest in maintaining and enhancing its 
market data products for the benefit and 
often at the behest of its customers and 
global investors. Such enhancements 
include refreshing all aspects of the 
technology ecosystem including 
software, hardware, and network while 
introducing new and innovative 
products. The goal of these 
enhancements, among other things, is to 
provide faster and more consistent 
market data products. The Exchange 
continues to expend resources to 
innovate and modernize technology so 
that it may benefit its members in 
offering its market data products. 
No Unfair Discrimination 
The Proposal is not unfairly 
discriminatory. The proposed feeds are 
optional data fees available to all market 
participants on a non-discriminatory 
basis. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
Nothing in the proposal burdens 
inter-market competition (the 
competition among self-regulatory 
organizations) because approval of the 
proposal does not impose any burden 
on the ability of other options exchanges 
to compete. 
Nothing in the Proposal burdens 
intra-market competition (the 
competition among consumers of 
exchange data), because TOPO, PHLX 
Orders, and TOPO Plus Orders are 
available to any market participant at 
the same price and any market 
participant that elects to purchase any 
of these products may do so on a non- 
discriminatory basis. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act.
25
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is: (i) necessary or appropriate in 
the public interest; (ii) for the protection 
of investors; or (iii) otherwise in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
If the Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

COMMISSION 
[Release No. 34–104423; File No. SR– 
NASDAQ–2025–103] 
Self-Regulatory Organizations; The 
Nasdaq Stock Market LLC; Notice of 
Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of 
Proposed Rule Change To Adopt 
Nasdaq Options 9, Section 25 To 
Codify an Options Unbundling Rule 
December 17, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
11, 2025, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 
(‘‘Nasdaq’’ or ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘SEC’’ or ‘‘Commission’’) the proposed 
rule change as described in Items I, II, 
and III, below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to adopt 
Nasdaq Options 9, Section 25 to codify 
the Exchange’s longstanding guidance 
that the unbundling of orders for any 
purpose other than best execution is 
considered conduct inconsistent with 
just and equitable principles of trade. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/nasdaq/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Nasdaq Options 9 by adding a new 
Section 25 to codify its longstanding 
guidance that it shall be considered 
conduct inconsistent with just and 
equitable principles of trade for any 
member, member organization, or 
person associated with or employed by 
a member or member organization 
(collectively, ‘‘member’’ or ‘‘members’’) 
to split an order into multiple smaller 
orders for any purpose other than 
seeking the best execution of the entire 
order. Members of the Exchange are not 
allowed to engage in conduct 
inconsistent with just and equitable 
principles of trade.
3
 
‘‘Unbundling,’’ also known as ‘‘trade 
shredding,’’ is the practice of breaking 
up an order into multiple smaller orders 
for some purpose other than the best 
execution of the order. The practice of 
unbundling has in the past been used 
for purposes such as improperly 
maximizing commissions and fees 
charged to customers, distorting trade 
data, or circumventing rules pertaining 
to maximum order size.
4
 
The Exchange believes that the 
unbundling of orders generally serves 
no purpose to the customer that entered 
the order and may cause unnecessary 
delays in the execution of that order. 
This belief has been reflected in the 
Exchange’s longstanding regulatory 
guidance to its members.
5
 
The impermissibility of unbundling is 
a well-established principle across the 
U.S. securities markets. Other options 
exchanges have anti-unbundling rules 
or rule interpretations that are similar to 
the rule being adopted by the 
Exchange.
6
Additionally, other 
exchanges have also issued regulatory 
guidance to their members warning 
them against the practice of 
unbundling.
7
Finally, the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority 
(‘‘FINRA’’) also has its own anti- 
unbundling rule, FINRA Rule 5290, 
which specifies, in part, that ‘‘[n]o 
member . . . shall engage in conduct 
that has the intent or effect of splitting 
any order into multiple smaller orders 
for execution or any execution into 
multiple smaller executions for 
transaction reporting for the primary 
purpose of maximizing a monetary or 
in-kind amount to be received by the 
member . . . as a result of the execution 
of such orders or the transaction 
reporting of such executions.’’ 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
8
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
9
 
in particular, in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general to protect 
investors and the public interest, by 
deterring and helping to prevent the 
distortive practice of unbundling. 
The Exchange believes that the 
unbundling of orders generally serves 
no purpose to the customer that entered 
the order and may cause unnecessary 
delays in the execution of that order. 
Codifying its longstanding guidance in 
its rulebook that unbundling is conduct 
inconsistent with just and equitable 
principles of trade is thus designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade. Additionally, by defining 
unbundling as the practice of splitting 
an order into multiple smaller orders for 
any purpose other than seeking the best

11
17 CFR 240.19b–4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6) requires a self-regulatory organization to give 
the Commission written notice of its intent to file 
the proposed rule change at least five business days 
prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule 
change, or such shorter time as designated by the 
Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this 
requirement. 
12

execution of the entire order, the 
proposal is designed to promote best 
execution and thus protect investors 
and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange reiterates 
that the proposed rule is substantively 
identical to NYSE American Rule 
995NY(d) and it is consistent with the 
rules and regulatory guidance of other 
exchanges, as well as FINRA Rule 5290. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. In terms of 
intra-market competition, the Exchange 
notes that the proposed rule will apply 
equally to all members of the Exchange. 
Additionally, in terms of intermarket 
competition, the Exchange notes that 
the proposed rule is consistent with the 
rules of other exchanges, as well as the 
rules of FINRA. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: (i) significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant 
burden on competition; and (iii) become 
operative for 30 days from the date on 
which it was filed, or such shorter time 
as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
10
and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b–4 
thereunder.
11
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to

including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed 
Change To Amend Sections 140 and 
141 of the NYSE American Company 
Guide 
December 17, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1)
1
of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’)
2
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
3
 
notice is hereby given that, on December 
11, 2025, NYSE American LLC (‘‘NYSE 
American’’ or the ‘‘Exchange’’) filed 
with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ‘‘Commission’’) the 
proposed rule change as described in 
Items I, II, and III below, which Items 
have been prepared by the self- 
regulatory organization. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Sections 140 and 141 of the NYSE 
American Company Guide (the 
‘‘Company Guide’’) to amend the 
original and annual listing fees for stock 
issues. The proposed rule change is 
available on the Exchange’s website at 
www.nyse.com, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
self-regulatory organization included 
statements concerning the purpose of, 
and basis for, the proposed rule change 
and discussed any comments it received 
on the proposed rule change. The text 
of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. 
The Exchange has prepared summaries, 
set forth in sections A, B, and C below, 
of the most significant parts of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Sections 140 and 141 of the Company 
Guide to amend the original and annual 
listing fees for stock issues. The 
proposed changes will take effect from 
the beginning of the calendar year 
commencing on January 1, 2026. 
The Exchange currently charges 
original listing fees for stock issues on 
a tiered schedule based on the number 
of shares outstanding. At the low end of 
the fee schedule, an original listing fee 
of $50,000 is charged when there are 
less than 5,000,000 shares outstanding. 
At the top of the fee schedule, an 
original listing fee of $75,000 is charged 
when there are more than 15,000,000 
shares outstanding. There are two 
intermediate tiers. 
The Exchange proposes to eliminate 
the tiered schedule and charge a flat 
original listing fee of $75,000 for all 
stock issues.
4
Transitioning to a flat 
original listing fee will simplify the 
Exchange’s administrative process for 
billing original listing fees and also 
provide greater clarity to issuers seeking 
a listing on the Exchange. Further, in 
recent years, the substantial majority of 
issuers seeking to list a stock issue on 
the Exchange have had more than 
15,000,000 shares outstanding and were 
therefore subject to the top tier of the 
original listing fee schedule and the 
Exchange infrequently lists new classes 
of warrants. Accordingly, the proposed 
adoption of a flat original listing fee for 
stock issues and warrants is unlikely to 
have any meaningful impact on the fees 
paid by new issuers listing on the 
Exchange. In addition, the proposed 
change will not take effect until January 
1, 2026 so all issuers will be on notice 
of the new fee schedule. 
The Exchange currently charges an 
annual fee of $60,000 to issuers with 50 
million or fewer shares outstanding and 
an annual fee of $80,000 to issuers with 
more than 50 million shares 
outstanding. The Exchange proposes to 
amend Section 141 of the Company 
Guide to increase the annual fee for

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34–51808 
(June 9, 2005); 70 FR 37496 (June 29, 2005) 
(‘‘Regulation NMS’’).

See Regulation NMS, 70 FR at 37499. issuers with 50 million or fewer shares 
outstanding to $65,000, and to increase 
the annual fee for issuers with more 
than 50 million shares outstanding to 
$84,000. 
The proposed increase to the annual 
fee for stock issues reflects increases in 
the costs the Exchange incurs in 
providing services to listed companies 
on an ongoing basis including in 
relation to company events and 
advocacy on behalf of listed companies, 
as well as increases in the costs of 
conducting its related regulatory 
activities. In 2025, the Exchange 
increased the number of educational 
events it hosted for companies listed on 
the Exchange and also enhanced its 
facilities that can be used by listed 
companies. The Exchange proposes to 
make the aforementioned fee increases 
to better reflect the Exchange’s costs 
related to listing equity securities and 
the corresponding value of such listing 
to companies. 
The revised annual fee for stock 
issues will be applied in the same 
manner to all issuers with listed 
securities in the affected categories and 
the Exchange believes that the changes 
will not disproportionately affect any 
specific category of issuers. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
Section 6(b) of the Act,
5
in general, and 
furthers the objectives of Section 
6(b)(4)
6
of the Act, in particular, in that 
it is designed to provide for the 
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees, and other charges. The Exchange 
also believes that the proposed rule 
change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
7
in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to foster cooperation and 
coordination with persons engaged in 
regulating, clearing, settling, processing 
information with respect to, and 
facilitating transactions in securities, to 
remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest and is not designed to 
permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Exchange believes that it is not 
unfairly discriminatory and represents 
an equitable allocation of reasonable 
fees to amend Section 140 of the 
Company Guide to transition to a flat 
original listing fee for stock issues 
because, as noted above, nearly all 
companies seeking to list on the 
Exchange already fall within the top tier 
of the current fee schedule. Therefore, 
the proposed change will not have any 
meaningful impact on most issuers 
seeking to list on the Exchange. In 
addition, the proposed change will not 
take effect until January 1, 2026 so all 
issuers will be on notice of the new fee 
schedule. 
The Exchange believes that it is not 
unfairly discriminatory and represents 
an equitable allocation of reasonable 
fees to amend Section 141 of the 
Company Guide to increase the annual 
fees for listed equity securities as set 
forth above because of the increased 
costs incurred by the Exchange since it 
established the current rates. 
The Proposed Changes Are Reasonable 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed changes to the original and 
annual fee schedule for listed equity 
securities are reasonable. In that regard, 
the Exchange notes that most issuers 
seeking to list on the exchange already 
pay a $75,000 original listing fee as they 
have more than 15,000,000 shares 
outstanding. The proposed change to 
adopt a flat original listing fee and 
eliminate the current tiered structure 
simplifies the Exchange’s billing 
practices and provides improved clarity 
to issuers. 
Moreover, the Exchange notes that its 
general costs to support its listed 
companies have increased, including 
due to price inflation. The Exchange 
also continues to expand and improve 
the services it provides to listed 
companies. Specifically, the Exchange 
has (among other things) increased 
expenditure on listed companies and 
the value of an NYSE American listing 
by increasing programming for listed 
companies and enhancing its conference 
space which can be utilized by listed 
companies. 
The Exchange operates in a highly 
competitive marketplace for the listing 
of the various categories of securities 
affected by the proposed original and 
annual fee adjustments. The 
Commission has repeatedly expressed 
its preference for competition over 
regulatory intervention in determining 
prices, products, and services in the 
securities markets. Specifically, in 
Regulation NMS,
8
the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO 
revenues and, also, recognized that 
current regulation of the market system 
‘‘has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
9
 
The Exchange believes that the ever- 
shifting market share among the 
exchanges with respect to new listings 
and the transfer of existing listings 
between competitor exchanges 
demonstrates that issuers can choose 
different listing markets in response to 
fee changes. Accordingly, competitive 
forces constrain exchange listing fees. 
Stated otherwise, changes to exchange 
listing fees can have a direct effect on 
the ability of an exchange to compete for 
new listings and retain existing listings. 
Given this competitive environment, 
the adoption of the proposed flat 
original listing fee and increase to the 
annual listing fee for equity securities 
represents a reasonable attempt to 
address the Exchange’s costs in 
servicing these listings while continuing 
to attract and retain listings. 
The Proposal Is an Equitable Allocation 
of Fees 
The Exchange believes its proposal 
equitably allocates its fees among its 
market participants. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed amendments to the original 
listing fee for stock issues is equitable 
because the substantial majority of 
issuers seeking to list on the Exchange 
are already paying the top fee under the 
current schedule and the proposed 
change, therefore, will not have any 
meaningful impact on any category of 
issuer. Further, the annual fees for 
equity securities are equitable because 
they do not change the existing 
framework for such fees, but simply 
increase the amount of the annual fee to 
reflect increased operating costs. 
Similarly, as the fee structure remains 
effectively unchanged apart from the 
proposed increases in the rates paid by 
all issuers, the changes to the annual fee 
for equity securities neither target nor 
will they have a disparate impact on any 
particular category of issuer. Lastly, the 
proposed change will not take effect 
until January 1, 2026 so all issuers will 
be on notice of the new fee schedule. 
The Proposal Is Not Unfairly 
Discriminatory 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposal is not unfairly discriminatory. 
The proposed fee changes are not 
unfairly discriminatory among issuers of 
operating company equity securities 
because the same fee schedules will 
apply to all such issuers. Further, the 
Exchange operates in a competitive 
environment and its fees are constrained

by competition in the marketplace. 
Other venues currently list all of the 
categories of securities covered by the 
proposed fees and if a company believes 
that the Exchange’s fees are 
unreasonable it can decide either not to 
list its securities or to list them on an 
alternative venue. 
For the foregoing reasons, the 
Exchange believes that the proposal is 
consistent with the Act. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
proposed rule change is designed to 
ensure that the fees charged by the 
Exchange accurately reflect the services 
provided and benefits realized by listed 
issuers. The market for listing services 
is extremely competitive. Each listing 
exchange has a different fee schedule 
that applies to issuers seeking to list 
securities on its exchange. Issuers have 
the option to list their securities on 
these alternative venues based on the 
fees charged and the value provided by 
each listing. Because issuers have a 
choice to list their securities on a 
different national securities exchange, 
the Exchange does not believe that the 
proposed fee changes impose a burden 
on competition. 
Intramarket Competition 
The proposed amended fees will be 
charged to all listed issuers on the same 
basis. The Exchange does not believe 
that the proposed amended fees will 
have any meaningful effect on the 
competition among issuers listed on the 
Exchange. 
Intermarket Competition 
The Exchange operates in a highly 
competitive market in which issuers can 
readily choose to list new securities on 
other exchanges and transfer listings to 
other exchanges if they deem fee levels 
at those other venues to be more 
favorable. Because competitors are free 
to modify their own fees, and because 
issuers may change their chosen listing 
venue, the Exchange does not believe its 
proposed fee change can impose any 
burden on intermarket competition

II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these

places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant parts of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend and 
restate the Governing Documents to 
reflect amendments made in connection 
with a capital raise by TXSE Group from 
certain new and existing Stockholders
7
 
(the ‘‘Transaction’’) as further described 
below. Each of these proposed 
amendments is discussed below. 
Background 
The primary purpose of the 
Exchange’s proposal to amend and 
restate the Stockholders’ Agreement and 
the Certificate of Incorporation in order 
to add two new Stockholders and to 
make all necessary corresponding 
changes. The proceeds resulting from 
the Transaction will be paid to TXSE 
Group by the new and existing 
Stockholders participating in the 
Transaction, and such proceeds will be 
used by TXSE Group for general 
corporate expenses, including to 
support the operations and regulation of 
the Exchange, which is a subsidiary of 
TXSE Group. Although each 
Stockholder’s proportionate ownership 
of TXSE Group may change as a result 
of the Transaction, no Stockholder will 
exceed any ownership or voting 
limitations applicable to the 
Stockholders set forth in the 
Stockholders’ Agreement or Certificate 
of Incorporation after giving effect to the 
Transaction and the amendments to the 
Stockholders’ Agreement and Certificate 
of Incorporation proposed herein.
8
None 
of the amendments to the Governing 
Documents proposed herein would 
impact the governance of TXSE Group 
or the Exchange. 
The Transaction and all amendments 
to the Stockholders’ Agreement and 
Certificate of Incorporation proposed 
herein were previously approved by the 
TXSE Group Board on December 4, 
2025, in accordance with the 
Stockholders’ Agreement. The Exchange 
expects the Transaction to be completed 
pursuant to one or more closings that 
would occur on or shortly after the date 
on which the amendments to the 
Certificate of Incorporation proposed 
herein become effective. 
Authorization and Issuance of 
Additional Non-Voting SLHC Common 
Stock 
Article FOURTH(a) of the Certificate 
of Incorporation currently contains 
provisions related to the authorization 
and issuance of Common Stock in 
multiple series including Voting 
Common Stock, Non-Voting Common 
Stock, Non-Voting SLHC Common 
Stock, Non-Voting BHC Common Stock, 
and Preferred Stock (all defined in 
Articles FOURTH(a)(i) and (ii)) and 
specifies the rights associated with each 
type of Equity Security.
9
The Exchange 
is proposing to amend Articles 
FOURTH(a) and FOURTH(a)(i) to 
increase the authorized stock from 
eighty million (80,000,000) shares to 
one hundred million (100,000,000) 
shares, to increase the authorized 
Common Stock from seventy million 
(70,000,000) shares to ninety million 
(90,000,000) shares, and to increase the 
authorized Non-Voting BHC Common 
Stock from ten million (10,000,000) to 
thirty million (30,000,000). Non-Voting 
BHC Common Stock is designed to 
prevent exceeding regulatory thresholds 
associated with the U.S. Bank Holding 
Company Act of 1956, as amended (the 
‘‘BHCA’’), and Regulation Y. As 
proposed and further described below, 
Article SIXTH(a)(v) provides the 
circumstances under which Voting 
Common Stock held by a bank holding 
company investor will convert into 
Non-Voting BHC Common Stock to 
maintain compliance with applicable 
regulatory thresholds under the BHCA 
and Regulation Y, and further provides 
for protective voting rights for 
amendments that would significantly 
and adversely affect the rights of such 
type of Equity Security. 
The purpose of this change is to 
facilitate compliance of the New 
Stockholders
10
with requirements and 
restrictions under the BHCA, and 
amendments to the BHCA regulations 
issued by the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System regarding the 
framework for determining ‘‘control’’ 
under the BHCA, as well as 
interpretations of such amendments by 
the New Stockholders. The remaining 
changes applicable to the Stockholders’ 
Agreement and Certificate of 
Incorporation are further described 
below. 
Stockholders’ Agreement 
The Exchange is also proposing to 
make the following changes to the 
Stockholders’ Agreement: 
€To add the following definitions under Section 1: 
Æd. ‘‘Anti-Dilution Rights’’ means collectively, the BofA Anti-Dilution

Anti-Dilution Right and the Warren

2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed

the Exchange believes the proposed rule

See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No.

Stock Exchange LLC for Registration as a National 
Securities Exchange; Findings, Opinion, and Order 
of the Commission) at Section III, A (‘‘Ownership 
and Governance of TXSE’’) and Section III, B 
(‘‘TXSE Group and Regulation of the Exchange’’). 
change is consistent with the objectives 
of Section 6(b)(1)
12
of the Act in 
particular, in that such amendments 
enable the Exchange to be so organized 
as to have the capacity to be able to 
carry out the purposes of the Act and to 
comply with the provisions of the Act, 
the rules and regulations thereunder, 
and the rules of the Exchange. The 
Exchange also believes that the 
proposed amendments are consistent 
with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
13
which 
requires the rules of an exchange to be 
designed to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest. 
Amendments Related to the 
Transaction, Including Provisions 
Related to Non-Voting BHC Common 
Stock 
The Exchange believes that making 
the necessary changes to the 
Stockholders’ Agreement and Certificate 
of Incorporation to facilitate the 
Transaction, including the changes 
related to Non-Voting BHC Common 
Stock is consistent with the Act, as it 
would facilitate additional investment 
and funding for TXSE Group resulting 
from the Transaction, and such 
proceeds could be used by TXSE Group 
for general corporate expenses, 
including to support the operations and 
regulation of the Exchange. This would 
further enable the Exchange to be 
organized as to have the capacity to 
carry out the purposes of the Act and to 
comply with the provisions of the Act, 
the rules and regulations thereunder, 
and the rules of the Exchange, and, in 
turn, would protect investors and the 
public interest. Further, the Exchange 
notes that the proposal would put BofA 
and Goldman on equal footing with the 
existing Major Investors. Accordingly, 
the Exchange does not believe that the 
Transaction, making the necessary 
changes to the Stockholders’ Agreement 
and Certificate of Incorporation to add 
BofA and Goldman, and making the 
corresponding changes related to the 
Non-Voting BHC Common Stock would 
in any way restrict the Exchange’s 
ability to be organized as to have the 
capacity to carry out the purposes of the 
Act and to comply with the provisions 
of the Act, the rules and regulations 
thereunder, and the rules of the 
Exchange. 
As noted above, although each 
Stockholder’s proportionate ownership 
of TXSE Group may change as a result 
of the Transaction, no Stockholder will 
exceed any ownership or voting 
limitations applicable to the 
Stockholders as set forth in the 
Stockholders’ Agreement or Certificate 
of Incorporation after giving effect to the 
Transaction and the proposed 
amendments to the Stockholders’ 
Agreement and Certificate of 
Incorporation. 
Therefore, the Exchange believes 
these proposed changes are appropriate 
and consistent with Section 6(b)(1) of 
the Act, in that such amendments 
enable the Exchange to be so organized 
as to have the capacity to carry out the 
purposes of the Act and to comply with 
the provisions of the Act, the rules and 
regulations thereunder, and the rules of 
the Exchange, and because such 
amendments will not impair the ability 
of the Exchange to carry out its 
functions and responsibilities as an 
‘‘exchange’’ under the Act, and the rules 
and regulations promulgated 
thereunder, nor do such amendments 
impair the ability of the SEC to enforce 
the Act and the rules and regulations 
promulgated thereunder with respect to 
the Exchange. 
Conforming and Clarifying 
Amendments 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
amendments to make clarifications, 
correct inadvertent drafting errors, 
delete obsolete language, make 
conforming changes consistent with the 
other proposed amendments to the 
Stockholders’ Agreement and Certificate 
of Incorporation described above, and 
make other technical and conforming 
changes to reflect that the Stockholders’ 
Agreement is being amended and 
restated from the Sixth Amended and 
Restated Stockholders’ Agreement to the 
Seventh Amended and Restated 
Stockholders’ Agreement and the 
Certificate of Incorporation is being 
amended and restated from the Fifth 
Amended and Restated Certificate of 
Incorporation to the Sixth Amended and 
Restated Certificate of Incorporation are 
consistent with the Act, as such 
amendments would update and clarify 
the Stockholders’ Agreement and 
Certificate of Incorporation, thereby 
increasing transparency and helping to 
avoid any potential confusion resulting 
from retaining outdated, obsolete, or 
unclear provisions. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
amendments to the Stockholders’ 
Agreement and Certificate of 
Incorporation described in this proposal 
are consistent with, and will not 
interfere with, the self-regulatory 
obligations of the Exchange. The 
Exchange importantly notes that it is not 
proposing to materially alter TXSE 
Group’s or the Exchange’s existing 
governance framework; amend any of 
the provisions within the Exchange’s 
LLC Agreement related to the 
Exchange’s obligations as a self- 
regulatory organization or within the 
Stockholders’ Agreement and the 
Certificate of Incorporation that would 
impact the Exchange’s ability to carry 
out its obligations as a self-regulatory 
organization; or to alter any provisions 
dealing with the availability or 
protection of information, books and 
records, undue influence, conflicts of 
interest, unfair control by an affiliate, or 
regulatory independence of the 
Exchange.
14
 
For these reasons, the Exchange 
believes such amendments would 
enable the Exchange to be so organized 
as to have the capacity to carry out the 
purposes of the Act and to comply with 
the provisions of the Act, the rules and 
regulations thereunder, and the rules of 
the Exchange, promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market, 
and protect investors and the public 
interest. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposal will impose any burden on 
competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. The proposal is not 
intended to address competitive issues 
but rather is concerned with changes to 
the Stockholders’ Agreement and 
Certificate of Incorporation in 
connection with the Transaction as well 
as updates and other changes to the 
corporate documents of TXSE Group 
related to the administration and 
governance of TXSE Group, as described 
above. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants or Others 
The Exchange has neither solicited 
nor received written comments on the 
proposed rule change.

17 CFR 240.19b–4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6) requires a self-regulatory organization to give 
the Commission written notice of its intent to file 
the proposed rule change at least five business days 
prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule 
change, or such shorter time as designated by the 
Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this 
requirement. 
17
For purposes only of waiving the 30-day 
operative delay, the Commission has considered the 
proposed rule’s impact on efficiency, competition, 
and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(f).

III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: (i) significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant 
burden on competition; and (iii) become 
operative for 30 days from the date on 
which it was filed, or such shorter time 
as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
15
and Rule 
19b–4(f)(6)
16
thereunder. 
A proposed rule change filed under 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6) normally does not 
become operative prior to 30 days after 
the date of filing. Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii), 
however, permits the Commission to 
designate a shorter time if such action 
is consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest. The 
Exchange has requested that the 
Commission waive the 30-day operative 
delay contained in Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii) 
so that the Exchange may amend the 
Stockholders’ Agreement and Certificate 
of Incorporation to accommodate the 
addition of new investors in TXSE 
Group in order to facilitate the closing 
of the Transaction as soon as possible. 
The Commission finds that waiver of 
the operative delay is consistent with 
the protection of investors and the 
public interest because the proposed 
changes to the Stockholder’s Agreement 
and Certificate of Incorporation to 
reflect the addition of new investors do 
not materially alter TXSE Group’s 
governance framework or raise novel 
issues. Accordingly, the Commission 
hereby waives the operative delay and 
designates the proposal operative upon 
filing.
17
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposal is 
consistent with the Act. Comments may

17 CFR 240.19b–4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6) requires a self-regulatory organization to give 
the Commission written notice of its intent to file 
the proposed rule change at least five business days 
prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule 
change, or such shorter time as designated by the 
Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this 
requirement. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend BX 
Options 9 by adding a new Section 25 
to codify its longstanding guidance that 
it shall be considered conduct 
inconsistent with just and equitable 
principles of trade for any member, 
member organization, or person 
associated with or employed by a 
member or member organization 
(collectively, ‘‘member’’ or ‘‘members’’) 
to split an order into multiple smaller 
orders for any purpose other than 
seeking the best execution of the entire 
order. Members of the Exchange are not 
allowed to engage in conduct 
inconsistent with just and equitable 
principles of trade.
3
 
‘‘Unbundling,’’ also known as ‘‘trade 
shredding,’’ is the practice of breaking 
up an order into multiple smaller orders 
for some purpose other than the best 
execution of the order. The practice of 
unbundling has in the past been used 
for purposes such as improperly 
maximizing commissions and fees 
charged to customers, distorting trade 
data, or circumventing rules pertaining 
to maximum order size.
4
 
The Exchange believes that the 
unbundling of orders generally serves 
no purpose to the customer that entered 
the order and may cause unnecessary 
delays in the execution of that order. 
This belief has been reflected in the 
Exchange’s longstanding regulatory 
guidance to its members.
5
 
The impermissibility of unbundling is 
a well-established principle across the 
U.S. securities markets. Other options 
exchanges have anti-unbundling rules 
or rule interpretations that are similar to 
the rule being adopted by the 
Exchange.
6
Additionally, other 
exchanges have also issued regulatory 
guidance to their members warning 
them against the practice of 
unbundling.
7
Finally, the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority 
(‘‘FINRA’’) also has its own anti- 
unbundling rule, FINRA Rule 5290, 
which specifies, in part, that ‘‘[n]o 
member . . . shall engage in conduct 
that has the intent or effect of splitting 
any order into multiple smaller orders 
for execution or any execution into 
multiple smaller executions for 
transaction reporting for the primary 
purpose of maximizing a monetary or 
in-kind amount to be received by the 
member . . . as a result of the execution 
of such orders or the transaction 
reporting of such executions.’’ 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
8
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
9
 
in particular, in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general to protect 
investors and the public interest, by 
deterring and helping to prevent the 
distortive practice of unbundling. 
The Exchange believes that the 
unbundling of orders generally serves 
no purpose to the customer that entered 
the order and may cause unnecessary 
delays in the execution of that order. 
Codifying its longstanding guidance in 
its rulebook that unbundling is conduct 
inconsistent with just and equitable 
principles of trade is thus designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade. Additionally, by defining 
unbundling as the practice of splitting 
an order into multiple smaller orders for 
any purpose other than seeking the best 
execution of the entire order, the 
proposal is designed to promote best 
execution and thus protect investors 
and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange reiterates 
that the proposed rule is substantively 
identical to NYSE American Rule 
995NY(d) and it is consistent with the 
rules and regulatory guidance of other 
exchanges, as well as FINRA Rule 5290. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. In terms of 
intra-market competition, the Exchange 
notes that the proposed rule will apply 
equally to all members of the Exchange. 
Additionally, in terms of intermarket 
competition, the Exchange notes that 
the proposed rule is consistent with the 
rules of other exchanges, as well as the 
rules of FINRA. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: (i) significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant 
burden on competition; and (iii) become 
operative for 30 days from the date on 
which it was filed, or such shorter time 
as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
10
and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b–4 
thereunder.
11
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings

a specified number of shares in a specified System 
Security submitted to the PHLX Equities Market by 
a Participant. An ‘‘Order Type’’ is a standardized 
set of instructions associated with an Order that 
define how it will behave with respect to pricing, 
execution, and/or posting to the PSX Book when 
submitted to PHLX. See PHLX Equity 1, Section 1(e). The PSX Book is a montage for quotes and 
orders that collects and ranks all quotes and orders 
submitted by Participants. See PHLX Equity 1, Section 1(a)(1). 
4
An ‘‘Order Attribute’’ is a further set of variable 
instructions that may be associated with an Order 
to further define how it will behave with respect to 
pricing, execution, and/or posting to the PSX Book 
when submitted to PHLX. The available Order 
Types and Order Attributes, and the Order 
Attributes that may be associated with particular 
Order Types, are described in Equity 4, Rules 
3301A and 3301B. One or more Order Attributes 
may be assigned to a single Order; provided, 
however, that if the use of multiple Order Attributes 
would provide contradictory instructions to an 
Order, the System will reject the Order or remove 
non-conforming Order Attributes. See id.

the Exchange on a day when the Exchange closes 
early). See PHLX Equity 1, Section 1(g). 9

[Release No. 34–104431; File No. SR–PHLX– 
2025–73] 
Self-Regulatory Organizations; Nasdaq 
PHLX LLC; Notice of Filing and 
Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed 
Rule Change To Discontinue the Good- 
Till-Cancelled Time-in-Force Order 
Attribute in Its Equities Market 
December 17, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
16, 2025, Nasdaq PHLX LLC (‘‘PHLX’’ or 
‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’ or 
‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III, below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to 
discontinue the Good-Till-Cancelled 
Time-in-Force Order Attribute in its 
equities market. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/phlx/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to 
discontinue the Time-in-Force of Good- 
Till-Cancelled from its equities market. 
Participants who trade equities in the 
Exchange can choose among many 
Order Types.
3
Participants can also 
choose to apply different Order 
Attributes to their Orders.
4
One of those 
Order Attributes is Time-in-Force 
(‘‘TIF’’).
5
The TIF assigned to an Order 
is the period of time that the System 
will hold the Order for potential 
execution. Participants specify an 
Order’s TIF by designating a time at 
which the Order will become active and 
a time at which the Order will cease to 
be active.
6
Among the times available 
for Order deactivation is one year after 
Order entry.
7
 
An Order that is designated to 
deactivate one year after entry may be 
referred to as a ‘‘Good-till-Cancelled’’ or 
‘‘GTC’’ Order. If a GTC Order is 
designated as eligible for execution 
during Market Hours
8
only, it may be 
referred to as having a Time in Force of 
‘‘Market Hours Good-till-Cancelled’’ or 
‘‘MGTC.’’
9
If a GTC Order is designated 
as eligible for execution during System 
Hours,
10
it may be referred to as having 
a Time in Force of ‘‘System Hours Good- 
till-Cancelled’’ or ‘‘SGTC.’’
11
Therefore, 
both in the Exchange’s rules and in this 
filing, references to the TIF of GTC 
include both the TIF of MGTC and the 
TIF of SGTC.

17 CFR 240.19b–4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6) requires a self-regulatory organization to give 
the Commission written notice of its intent to file 
the proposed rule change at least five business days 
prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule 
change, or such shorter time as designated by the 
Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this 
requirement. 
The Exchange proposes to 
discontinue the availability of the GTC 
TIF on its equities market. In order to 
do so, the Exchange proposes to modify 
PHLX Equity 4, Rule 3301B(a) to delete 
‘‘one year after entry’’ from the list of 
available times for deactivating an 
Order. The Exchange also proposes to 
modify PHLX Equity 4, Rule 
3301B(a)(3), which contains the 
definition of the GTC TIF, by deleting it 
in its entirety and reserving that rule 
number. 
The Exchange also proposes to make 
the following conforming changes to its 
Equity Rules, to delete all other 
references to GTC Orders: 
€PHLX Equity 4, Rule 3301A(b)(5)(B) specifies that a Market Maker Peg Order 
may not have a TIF of GTC. The 
Exchange proposes to remove this 
reference to GTC. 
€PHLX Equity 4, Rule 3311 concerns procedures in response to issuer 
corporate actions, including any 
dividend (whether payable in cash or 
securities or both), payment, 
distribution, forward or reverse stock 
split, symbol change, or change in 
primary listing venue. Rule 3311(b) 
contains only such procedures that are 
specific to Orders with a TIF of GTC. 
Therefore, the Exchange proposes to 
remove Rule 3311(b) in its entirety. 
Consistent with this change, the 
Exchange proposes to redesignate Rule 
3311(a) as Rule 3311, and to remove the 
introductory ‘‘Except as provided 
below,’’ introductory phrase to that rule. 
€PHLX Equity 6, Section 5 sets out the risk settings that the Exchange offers 
to a Participant’s activities on the 
Exchange. Section 5(c) concerns Cancel- 
on-Disconnect Control. This optional 
control allows a Participant, when it 
experiences a disruption in its 
connection to the Exchange, to 
immediately cancel all pending 
Exchange Orders except GTC Orders. 
The Exchange proposes to remove this 
reference to GTC Orders. 
Starting on the day that the Exchange 
discontinues the GTC TIF Order 
Attribute, any new GTC Orders sent to 
the Exchange will be rejected. Any GTC 
Orders remaining on the PSX Book at 
the close of the trading day immediately 
preceding the discontinuation of the 
GTC TIF Order Attribute will be 
cancelled by the Exchange. The 
discontinuation of the GTC TIF Order 
Attribute will become operative in the 
first quarter of 2026. The Exchange 
currently intends to discontinue GTC 
Orders on February 2, 2026. Therefore, 
any GTC Orders remaining on the PSX 
Book at the close of trading on January 
30, 2026, would be cancelled by the 
Exchange.
12
If the Exchange were to 
postpone this February 2, 2026, 
discontinuation date to a later date in 
the first quarter of 2026, the new 
discontinuation date would be 
communicated by the Exchange through 
an Equity Trader Alert. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
13
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
14
 
in particular, in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
It is consistent with the Act for the 
Exchange to modify the Order Attributes 
available on equities orders on the 
Exchange. PHLX has found that very 
few Participants avail themselves of the 
GTC TIF. Retaining this functionality 
adds complexity to the Exchange’s 
rulebook that outweighs its utility to 
Participants. Discontinuing this disused 
functionality will promote just and 
equitable principles of trade and remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system by 
streamlining the TIFs offered on the 
Exchange. 
It is also consistent with the Act to 
delete all references GTC Orders found 
in the Exchange’s listing rules and 
Equity Rules. Removing this now- 
obsolete rule text will promote just and 
equitable principles of trade and remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system by 
avoiding any possible confusion as to 
the discontinuation of the GTC TIF 
functionality. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule changes will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. In this 
regard, proposed changes that 
streamline the Order Attributes 
available on the Exchange are pro- 
competitive because they bolster the 
efficiency, functionality, and overall 
attractiveness of the Exchange in an 
absolute sense and relative to its peers. 
Moreover, the proposed changes will 
not unduly burden intra-market 
competition among various Exchange 
participants. PHLX has observed that 
very few Participants currently avail 
themselves of the GTC TIF, so that it is 
no longer worthwhile for the Exchange 
to retain this functionality and its 
attendant complexity. The Exchange 
would continue to offer Participants 
many other TIF options to help them 
achieve their trading objectives. 
Furthermore, if there are Participants 
who are dissatisfied with the proposal, 
they are free to shift their order flow to 
competing venues that may offer them 
order handling functionality that better 
suits their trading objectives. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: (i) significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant 
burden on competition; and (iii) become 
operative for 30 days from the date on 
which it was filed, or such shorter time 
as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
15
and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b–4 
thereunder.
16
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved.

Proceedings To Determine Whether To 
Approve or Disapprove a Proposed 
Rule Change To Amend Functionality 
Relating to the Processing of Auction 
Responses 
December 17, 2025. 
I. Introduction 
On September 30, 2025, Cboe 
Exchange, Inc. (‘‘Exchange’’ or ‘‘Cboe’’) 
filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (‘‘Commission’’), pursuant 
to Section 19(b)(1)
1
of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (‘‘Act’’)
2
and Rule 
19b–4 thereunder,
3
a proposed rule 
change to amend the maximum amount 
of time permitted for processing auction 
responses in non-FLEX classes. The 
proposed rule change was published for 
comment in the Federal Register on 
October 3, 2025.
4
On November 3, 2025, 
pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) of 
the Act,
5
the Commission designated a 
longer period within which to approve 
the proposed rule change, disapprove 
the proposed rule change, or institute 
proceedings to determine whether to 
disapprove the proposed rule change.
6
 
The Commission has not received any 
comments on the proposal. Pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act,
7
the 
Commission is hereby instituting 
proceedings to determine whether to 
approve or disapprove the proposed 
rule change. 
II. Description of the Proposed Rule 
Change 
The Exchange currently offers the 
following auction and exposure 
mechanisms (‘‘auctions’’): Complex 
Order Auction (‘‘COA’’),
8
Step Up 
Mechanism (‘‘SUM’’),
9
Automated 
Improvement Mechanism (‘‘AIM’’),
10
 
Complex AIM (‘‘C–AIM’’),
11
Solicitation 
Auction Mechanism (‘‘SAM’’),
12
 
Complex SAM (‘‘C–SAM’’),
13
FLEX 
Auction process,
14
FLEX AIM,
15
and 
FLEX SAM.
16
In general in these 
auctions, the System
17
electronically 
exposes eligible orders for an Exchange- 
determined period of time in 
accordance with the applicable 
Exchange Rule, during which time, in 
response to an auction notification 
message, Users
18
may submit auction 
responses or auction response messages. 
Cboe Rule 5.25(c) provides that at the 
conclusion of an auction response or 
exposure period, the System will 
continue to process any messages in its 
inbound queue that were received by 
the System before the end of the auction 
response or exposure period, as 
identified by each message’s timestamp, 
for up to an Exchange-determined 
period of time on a class-by-class basis. 
This Exchange-determined period of 
time may not exceed 100 milliseconds, 
except in the case of non-FLEX S&P 500 
Index options ‘‘SPX options.’’
19
For 
non-FLEX SPX options, this Exchange- 
determined period of time plus the 
length of the auction response or 
exposure period, as applicable, may not 
exceed 1000 milliseconds (until 
December 31, 2025).
20
The applicable 
auction will execute once all messages, 
including auction responses, received 
before the end time of the auction 
response period have been processed or 
the Exchange-determined maximum 
time limit has elapsed, whichever 
occurs first.
21
 
The Exchange is proposing to make 
permanent the non-FLEX SPX 
functionality and broaden it such that it 
applies to all non-FLEX option classes,

See proposed Cboe Rule 5.25(c); see also Notice, supra note 4, at 48095, n. 17. The term ‘‘FLEX auction’’ refers to the FLEX Auction process, 
FLEX AIM, and FLEX SAM. 
23
See proposed Cboe Rule 5.25(c). The Exchange will announce the length of the Exchange- 
determined processing period with reasonable 
advance notice via Exchange Notice. See Cboe Rule 5.25(c).

See Notice, supra note 4, at 48095–96. The Exchange states that it generally experiences 
significant increases in volumes and messages 
traffic when the market experiences volatility. As a 
result, the Exchange states that it has observed 
deeper pending message queues, which results in 
an increased number of timely received auction 
responses not being processed as part of the 
execution at the conclusion of an auction. The 
Exchange believes, based on its observations, that 
the proposed maximum time may increase the 
number of timely received auction responses that 
may execute against an auction order. See id. at 48096.

mechanisms, the System processing 
time for any messages in its inbound 
queue that were received by the System 
before the end of the auction response 
or exposure period (as identified by 
each message’s timestamp), plus the 
length of the auction response or 
exposure period, as applicable, may not 
exceed 1000 milliseconds.
23
Only 
auction responses submitted during the 
auction response or exposure period 
would be eligible for processing,
24
in 
time priority,
25
and the proposed rule 
change would make no changes to how 
the auction rules operate regarding 
allocation and execution priority.
26
 
The Exchange states, among other 
things,
27
that the proposed, increased 
maximum processing time will result in 
more timely-submitted auction 
responses having the opportunity to 
participate in the auction and being 
executed in all classes, particularly in 
times of volatility and high message 
traffic.
28
According to the Exchange, 
this may provide further opportunities 
for auctioned orders to receive price 
improvement, and may encourage 
liquidity providers to submit more 
auction responses, which may 
contribute to a deeper, more liquid 
action process.
29
The Exchange believes 
the proposal will continue to 
appropriately balance providing 
investors with timely processing of their 
options quote and order messages with 
providing investors who submit orders 
that are auctioned with additional 
liquidity.
30
The Exchange also states 
that given the much longer length of 
FLEX auctions, which may last three 
seconds to five minutes,
31
the Exchange 
believes an increase in auction response 
processing is unnecessary for FLEX SPX 
options.
32
 
The Exchange provides certain data in 
support of its proposal. Specifically, the 
Exchange states that, in 2025 prior to 
May 12 (the date on which the Exchange 
implemented the longer auction 
processing response time for non-FLEX 
SPX options), the percentage of auction 
responses in SPX that were received by 
the System before the end of the auction 
period (i.e., had received a Network Interface Card timestamp) but were 
rejected because the Exchange could not 
process them before the end of the 
combined auction response or exposure 
period (as applicable) plus the then- 
existing extra processing time, reached 
over 20% on several occasions and 
averaged approximately 7.64%.
33
 
Between May 12 and September 5, this 
percentage was nearly 0, according to 
the Exchange.
34
Despite the maximum 
auction response processing time being 
900 milliseconds, the average length of 
that time period used since that time 
was only about 14 milliseconds.
35
The 
Exchange believes, given the continued 
increase in options volumes across the 
industry (and thus all classes), that all 
classes could benefit from the additional 
processing times.
36
 
III. Proceedings To Determine Whether 
To Approve or Disapprove the 
Proposed Rule Change 
The Commission hereby institutes 
proceedings pursuant to Section 
19(b)(2)(B) of the Act
37
to determine 
whether the Exchange’s proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved. Institution of proceedings 
does not indicate that the Commission 
has reached any conclusions with 
respect to any of the issues involved. 
Rather, the Commission seeks and 
encourages interested persons to 
provide additional comment on the 
proposed rule change to inform the 
Commission’s analysis of whether to 
approve or disapprove the proposed 
rule change. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the 
Act,
38
the Commission is providing 
notice of the grounds for disapproval 
under consideration. The Commission is 
instituting proceedings to allow for 
additional analysis of, and input from 
commenters with respect to, the 
consistency of the proposed rule change 
with the Act and, in particular, Section 
6(b)(5) of the Act,
39
which requires that 
the rules of a national securities 
exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest, and not be designed to 
permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
Under the Commission’s Rules of 
Practice, the ‘‘burden to demonstrate 
that a proposed rule change is 
consistent with the [Act] and the rules 
and regulations issued thereunder . . . 
is on the self-regulatory organization 
that proposed the rule change.’’
40
The 
description of a proposed rule change, 
its purpose and operation, its effect, and 
a legal analysis of its consistency with 
applicable requirements must all be 
sufficiently detailed and specific to 
support an affirmative Commission 
finding,
41
and any failure of a self- 
regulatory organization to provide this 
information may result in the 
Commission not having a sufficient 
basis to make an affirmative finding that 
a proposed rule change is consistent 
with the Act and the applicable rules 
and regulations.
42
 
As discussed above, currently, the 
Exchange-determined period of 
additional processing time for timely- 
received auction responses may not 
exceed 100 milliseconds, except that 
this maximum processing time is 1000 
milliseconds for auctions in non-FLEX 
SPX options. The Exchange’s proposal 
would increase to 1000 milliseconds the 
maximum processing time for all non- 
FLEX classes (and make the 1000- 
millisecond maximum processing time 
period permanent for non-FLEX SPX 
classes), and no longer apply an auction 
message processing time to any FLEX 
auctions. 
The Commission is concerned that the 
proposal does not provide an adequate 
basis, at this time, for the Commission 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  21:51 Dec 19, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00144 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\22DEN1.SGM 22DEN1

See, e.g., 100 Millisecond Order, supra note 19, at 40878 n. 21 (stating that an Exchange review 
indicated that approximately 55% of auction 
responses had no opportunity to execute in their 
respective auctions notwithstanding being 
submitted within the auction response period). 
44
See 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) and (8). 45
15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2). Section 19(b)(2) of the Act 
grants the Commission flexibility to determine what 
type of proceeding—either oral or notice and 
opportunity for written comments—is appropriate 
for consideration of a particular proposal by an 
SRO. See Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Report of the Senate Committee on Banking, 
Housing and Urban Affairs to Accompany S. 249, 
S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 30 (1975). 
46
17 CFR 200.30–3(a)(57). 
to conclude that the proposed increase 
to the maximum processing time for 
auction messages in non-FLEX classes 
other than SPX and the proposed non- 
application of any auction response 
processing time to FLEX auctions would 
be consistent with the Act. While the 
Exchange sets forth benefits that could 
accrue from the proposal, the data it 
proffers in support of the proposal is 
specific to its experience with non- 
FLEX SPX options. The proposal does 
not set forth data directly supporting the 
proposed increase in the maximum 
processing time for non-FLEX classes 
other than SPX.
43
The proposal also 
states that an increase in auction 
response processing time is unnecessary 
for FLEX SPX options in light of the fact 
that FLEX auctions may last three 
seconds to five minutes—a proposition 
with which the Commission agrees. But 
the proposal does not currently set forth 
support for the proposed non- 
application of any auction response 
processing time to any FLEX auction, 
which is an aspect of the proposal that, 
in the Commission’s view, is distinct 
from not increasing the auction 
response processing time for FLEX SPX 
options. Lastly, the Commission also 
seeks comment on whether the proposal 
presents any market risk due to a longer 
auction processing time for auction 
responses or the cancellation of auction 
responses that have been submitted 
during the auction response period. 
Accordingly, the Commission is 
instituting proceedings to allow for 
additional consideration and comment 
on the issues raised herein, including as 
to whether the proposal is consistent 
with the Act.
44
 
IV. Commission’s Solicitation of 
Comments 
The Commission requests written 
views, data, and arguments with respect 
to the concerns identified above as well 
as any other relevant concerns. Such 
comments should be submitted by 
January 12, 2026. Rebuttal comments 
should be submitted by January 26, 
2026. Although there do not appear to

disapproval that would be facilitated by 
an oral presentation of views, data, and 
arguments, the Commission will 
consider, pursuant to Rule 19b–4, any 
request for an opportunity to make an 
oral presentation.
45
 
The Commission asks that 
commenters address the sufficiency and 
merit of the Exchange’s statements in 
support of the proposal, in addition to 
any other comments they may wish to 
submit about the proposed rule change.

Abstract of Proposed Collection 
The Adoptive Family Relief Act (Pub. 
L. 114–70) amended Section 221(c) of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act 
(INA), 8 U.S.C. 1201(c), to allow for the 
waiver or refund certain immigrant visa 
fees for a lawfully adopted child, or a 
child coming to the United States to be 
adopted by a United States citizen, 
subject to criteria prescribed by the 
Secretary of State. 
The waiver or refund provides 
support and relief to U.S. citizen 
families seeking to bring their adoptive 
children home to the United States but 
have not been able to due to country 
specific limitations. For example, if a 
country suspends the issuance of ‘‘exit 
permits’’ for children who were 
adopted, U.S. citizen families repeatedly 
pay visa renewal and related fees, while 
also continuing to be separated from 
their adopted children. The DS–7781 
form collects information to determine 
the extra fees these families have paid 
and refunds them in accordance with 
the Adoptive Family Relief Act. 
Methodology 
The collection will be hosted on the 
Department of State website to be 
printed, filled out, and eventually sent 
to the consular section where the 
adoption case was originally processed.

Title: Hazardous Materials Training Requirements. 
Form Numbers: There are no FAA 
forms associated with this information 
collection. 
Type of Review: Renewal of an 
information collection. 
Background: The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period 
soliciting comments on the following 
collection of information was published 
on June 17, 2025 (90 FR 25742). As 
prescribed in Title 14 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (14 CFR) parts 121 
and 135, the FAA requires certificate 
holders to submit hazardous materials 
(hazmat) procedures and information 
(sometimes referred to as hazmat 
manuals) and hazmat training programs 
as a part of the FAA’s certification 
process. In addition, revisions to an 
approved hazmat training program must 
be submitted following certification to 
obtain initial and final approval as part 
of the FAA’s certification process. 
Revisions to an accepted manual may be 
requested following certification. Initial 
certification is completed in accordance 
with 14 CFR part 119. Continuing 
certification is completed in accordance 
with 14 CFR parts 121 and 135. The 
FAA uses the certification process to 
review the certificate holder’s hazmat 
manual and training programs for

OMB Control Number: 2120–0675. 
Title: Certification of Airports, Part 139. 
Form Numbers: FAA Form 5280–1. 
Type of Review: Renewal of an 
information collection. 
Background: The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period 
soliciting comments on the following 
collection of information was published 
on September 15, 2025 (90 FR 44450). 
The statutory authority to issue airport 
operating certificates to airports serving 
certain air carriers and to establish 
minimum safety standards for the 
operation of those airports is currently 
found in Title 49, United States Code 
(U.S.C.) § 44706, Airport operation 
certificates. The FAA uses this authority 
to issue requirements for the 
certification and operation of certain 
airports that service commercial air 
carriers. These requirements are 
contained in Title 14, Code of Federal 
Regulation Part 139 (14 CFR part 139), 
Certification and Operations: Land 
Airports Serving Certain Air Carriers, as 
amended. Information collection 
requirements are used by the FAA to 
determine an airport operator’s 
compliance with Part 139 safety and 
operational requirements, and to assist 
airport personnel to perform duties 
required under the regulation. 
Operators of certificated airports are 
required to complete FAA Form 5280– 
1 and develop, and comply with, a 
written document, an Airport 
Certification Manual (ACM) that details 
how an airport will comply with the 
requirements of Part 139. The ACM 
shows the means and procedures 
whereby the airport will be operated in 
compliance with Part 139, plus other 
instructions and procedures to help 
personnel concerned with operation of 
the airport to perform their duties and 
responsibilities. 
When an airport satisfactorily 
complies with such requirements, the 
FAA issues to that facility an airport 
operating certificate (AOC) that permits 
an airport to serve air carriers. The FAA 
periodically inspects these airports to 
ensure continued compliance with Part 
139 safety requirements, including the 
maintenance of specified records. Both 
the application for an AOC and annual 
compliance inspections require 
operators of certificated airports to 
collect and report certain operational 
information. The AOC remains in effect 
as long as the need exists and the 
operator complies with the terms of the 
AOC and the ACM. 
The likely respondents to new 
information requests are those civilian 
U.S. airport certificate holders who 
operate airports that serve scheduled 
and unscheduled operations of air 
carrier aircraft with more than 10 
passenger seats (approximately 520 
airports). These airport operators 
already hold an AOC and comply with 
all current information collection 
requirements. 
Operators of certificated airports are 
permitted to choose the methodology to 
report information and can design their 
own recordkeeping system. As airports 
vary in size, operations and 
complexities, the FAA has determined 
this method of information collection 
allows airport operators greater 
flexibility and convenience to comply 
with reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements. 100% of the information 
may be submitted electronically. 
The FAA has an automated system, 
the Certification and Compliance 
Management Information System 
(CCMIS), which allows FAA airport 
safety and certification inspectors to 
enter into a national database airport 
inspection information. This 
information is monitored to detect 
trends and developing safety issues, to 
allocate inspection resources, and 
generally, to be more responsive to the 
needs of regulated airports. 
The FAA has developed an automated 
reporting tool, the Airport Crisis 
Response Reporting (ACRR) tool, which 
allows airport personnel to directly 
input the operational status of an airport 
following an incident or emergency 
event that impacts an airport or the 
surrounding area. 
The following types of information 
are new to this information collection: 
the required implementation of SMS at 
certain airports and the requirement for 
all airports to maintain a UAS Response 
Plan. 
Part 139 subpart E (‘‘Airport Safety 
Management System’’), mandates Safety 
Management Systems. Operators of 
certificated airports are permitted to 
choose the methodology for reporting 
information and can design their own 
recordkeeping systems to meet their 
specific needs. This flexibility allows 
airports, which vary in size, operations, 
and complexity, to comply with FAA 
reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements more efficiently. All 
information collected under SMS can be 
submitted electronically. Airports are 
responsible for gathering and 
maintaining data on safety-related 
activities, including incident reports, 
safety risks, corrective actions, and 
performance evaluations. This 
information is crucial for the FAA to 
monitor safety trends, assess emerging 
risks, and allocate resources effectively, 
ensuring that safety management 
practices align with regulatory 
standards. 
Section 139.325 (‘‘Airport emergency 
plan.’’) requires part 139 certificate 
holders to develop and maintain an 
Airport Emergency Plan (AEP) to 
minimize the possibility and extent of 
personal injury and property damage on 
the airport in an emergency. UAS 
(Unmanned Aircraft Systems) Response 
Plans have become a mandatory 
component of an airport’s AEP in 
response to the increasing risks posed 
by UAS (often referred to as ‘‘drones’’) 
operations near airports. Recently 
mandated by the FAA, these plans 
outline the procedures airports must 
follow to detect, assess, and respond to 
UAS threats that could interfere with 
airport operations or compromise safety. 
The UAS Response Plans include 
strategies for coordination between 
airport personnel, local law 
enforcement, and the FAA, as well as 
protocols for identifying and mitigating 
potential UAS hazards. These plans 
ensure that airports are prepared to 
address the unique challenges posed by 
UAS incidents, enabling a swift and 
coordinated response to minimize
