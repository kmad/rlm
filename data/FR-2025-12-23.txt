DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY 
Office of the Secretary 
6 CFR Part 5 
[Docket No. DHS–2021–0020] 
RIN 1601–AB21 
Privacy Act of 1974 
AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, Department of Homeland Security. 
ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS or Department) is 
updating its regulations related to the 
procedures for submitting Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act 
of 1974 requests to clarify that 
requesters must generally submit their 
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 
requests and Privacy Act requests 
electronically. 
DATES: This final rule is effective January 22, 2026. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Roman Jankowski, Chief Privacy Officer, 
Privacy Office, Department of Homeland 
Security, Washington, DC 20528, (202) 
343–1717, Privacy@hq.dhs.gov. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
The Secretary of Homeland Security 
has authority under 5 U.S.C. 301, 552, 
and 552a, and 6 U.S.C. 112(e) to issue 
Freedom of Information Act and Privacy 
Act regulations. That authority has been 
delegated to the Chief Privacy Officer of 
the Department pursuant to 6 U.S.C. 142 
and DHS Del. No. 13001, Rev. 01 (June 
2, 2020). Most recently, DHS updated its 
procedures implementing the Freedom 
of Information Act and Privacy Act, 5 
U.S.C. 552a., at 6 CFR part 5, subparts 
A and B on November 16, 2022 (87 FR 
68599) and February 27, 2024 (89 FR 
14369). 
II. Discussion of Changes 
This rule updates Title 6, part 5, 
paragraphs 5.3(a)(2) and 5.21(a)(6), 
which provide instructions to requesters 
on how and where to make FOIA and 
Privacy Act (and Judicial Redress Act 
(JRA) if applicable) requests for DHS 
records. The rule generally requires 
requesters to submit their Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) requests and 
Privacy Act requests electronically 
through the web portal at https://
www.dhs.gov/foia or other acceptable Federal Government or DHS Component 
websites. DHS and its components will 
generally no longer accept FOIA or 
Privacy Act/JRA requests mailed to the 
DHS Privacy Office, or other DHS 
components, or via fax or email. By 
accepting requests only through DHS’s 
or its components’ websites, DHS will 
ensure requests are sent to the correct 
DHS Headquarters office or DHS 
component. In addition, this will reduce 
the time to interact with requesters and 
also expedite the time requesters will 
receive responsive records to their 
requests. In addition, this change will 
allow the Department to respond to 
requesters quickly and efficiently to 
correct any mistakes made in submitting 
their requests or clarifying their 
requests. Upon request, DHS FOIA 
public liaisons may facilitate, in limited 
circumstances (e.g., incarceration), an alternative method to submit requests 
for requesters who are unable to submit 
electronic requests. Requesters who are 
unable to submit electronic requests 
should contact the Office or DHS 
Component they wish to seek records 
from. 
III. Regulatory History 
DHS did not publish a notice of 
proposed rulemaking for this rule. 
Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A), this final rule 
is exempt from notice and public 
comment rulemaking requirements 
because the change involves rules of 
agency organization, procedure, or 
practice. In addition, under 5 U.S.C. 
553(b)(B), an agency may bypass notice 
and comment requirements if it finds, 
for good cause, that notice and comment 
is impracticable, unnecessary, or 
contrary to the public interest. DHS 
finds that notice and comment is 
unnecessary here because the change to 
the manner of submitting FOIA and 
Privacy Act requests is an agency 
procedural update that will have 
minimal substantive effect on the 
public. Specifically, DHS believes that 
submitting a request through a publicly 
accessible web portal is a routine and 
accepted method of seeking information 
in today’s society, and the vast majority 
of requesters already submit their 
requests this way. Furthermore, DHS 
will continue to consider requests for 
exceptions in limited circumstances for 
requesters who lack internet access. In 
addition, the rule is procedural because 
it changes only the manner in which the 
public presents FOIA and Privacy 
requests to DHS, and not the substance 
of those requests. Notice and comment 
is unnecessary because the public has 
come to accept using web pages to 
submit information and generally does 
so routinely. Electronic submission via 
web portal is also more efficient than 
using the U.S. Postal Service. and 
allows for better tracking of the 
submission and quicker response by the 
Government. 
III. Regulatory Analyses 
A. Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory 
Planning and Review), 13563 
(Improving Regulation and Regulatory 
Review), and 14192 (Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation) 
Executive Orders 13563 and 12866 
direct agencies to assess the costs and 
benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits. 
Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the 
importance of quantifying both costs 
and benefits, of reducing costs, of 
harmonizing rules, and of promoting 
flexibility. Executive Order 14192 
establishes a policy that the executive 
branch be ‘‘prudent and financially 
responsible in the expenditure of funds, 
from both public and private sources, 
and [ ] alleviate unnecessary regulatory 
burdens placed on the American 
people.’’ 
The Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) has not designated this rule a 
‘‘significant regulatory action,’’ under 
section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. 
Accordingly, OMB has not reviewed 
this rule. This rule is also not subject to 
Executive Order 14192 because the rule 
is not significant under Executive Order 
12866 and because it is related to 
agency organization, management, or 
personnel. See OMB Memorandum M– 25–20, ‘‘Guidance Implementing 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00001 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59946 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations Section 3 of Executive Order 14192, 
titled ‘Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation’’ (Mar. 26, 2025). 
DHS has considered the costs and 
benefits of this rule. This rule will not 
impose any new costs on the 
government or the public. The rule’s 
benefits include increased efficiency in 
processing and responding to FOIA and 
Privacy Act/JRA requests and decreased 
lag times for handling requests that 
would otherwise come from non-portal 
sources. Specifically, the rule allows 
DHS FOIA personnel to spend less time 
on data entry and administrative tasks if 
the requester submits through the 
electronic portal rather than through 
email, fax or physical mail. Spending 
less time on initial data entry and 
administrative tasks will allow DHS 
FOIA personal to spend more time 
searching and reviewing records to 
respond to the requests. 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
This rule will not result in the 
expenditure by state, local, and tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector, of $100,000,000 or more 
in any one year, and it will not 
significantly or uniquely affect small 
governments. Therefore, no written 
statement was deemed necessary under 
the provisions of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601–612, and section 
213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, 5 
U.S.C. 601 note, agencies must consider 
the impact of their rulemakings on 
‘‘small entities’’ (small businesses, small 
organizations, and local governments). 
The term ‘‘small entities’’ comprises 
small businesses, not-for-profit 
organizations that are independently 
owned and operated and are not 
dominant in their fields, and 
governmental jurisdictions with 
populations of less than 50,000. DHS 
has reviewed this regulation and by 
approving it certifies that this regulation 
will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. DHS does not believe this rule 
imposes any additional direct costs on 
small entities. 
Small Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996 
This rule is not a major rule as 
defined by section 251 of the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996 (as amended), 5 
U.S.C. 804(2). The Office of 
Management and Budget’s Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs has 
not found that this rule is likely to result 
in an annual effect on the economy of 
$100,000,000 or more; a major increase 
in costs or prices; or significant adverse 
effects on competition, employment, 
investment, productivity, innovation, or 
on the ability of United States-based 
companies to compete with foreign- 
based companies in domestic and 
export markets. 
National Environmental Policy Act 
DHS reviews regulatory actions to 
determine whether the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) 
applies to them and, if so, what degree 
of analysis is required. DHS Directive 
023–01 Rev. 01 (Directive) and 
Instruction Manual 023–01–001–01 Rev. 
01 (Instruction Manual) establish the 
procedures that DHS and its 
components use to comply with NEPA. 
NEPA allows Federal agencies to 
establish, in their NEPA implementing 
procedures, categories of actions 
(‘‘categorical exclusions’’) that 
experience has shown do not, 
individually or cumulatively, have a 
significant effect on the human 
environment and, therefore, do not 
require an environmental assessment or 
environmental impact statement. The 
Instruction Manual, Appendix A, lists 
the DHS categorical exclusions. 
Under DHS NEPA implementing 
procedures, for an action to be 
categorically excluded, it must satisfy 
each of the following three conditions: 
(1) the entire action clearly fits within 
one or more of the categorical 
exclusions; (2) the action is not a piece 
of a larger action; and (3) no 
extraordinary circumstances exist that 
create the potential for a significant 
environmental effect. 
This rule is strictly procedural and is 
limited to updating the method by 
which requesters may submit requests 
for information under FOIA and the 
Privacy Act/JRA. DHS has reviewed this 
rule and finds that it clearly fits within 
categorical exclusion A3(a) as an 
administrative or procedural rule that 
will have no significant effect on the 
environment, is not part of a larger 
Federal action, and does not present 
extraordinary circumstances that create 
the potential for significant 
environmental impacts. Therefore, the 
rule is categorically excluded from 
further NEPA review. 
List of Subjects in 6 CFR Part 5 
Classified Information, Courts, 
Freedom of information, Government 
employees, Privacy. 
For the reasons stated in the 
preamble, DHS amends Chapter I part 5 
of Title 6, Code of Federal Regulations, 
as follows: 
PART 5—DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS 
AND INFORMATION 
1. The authority citation for Part 5 
continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 6 U.S.C. 101 et seq.; Pub. L. 107–296, 116 Stat. 2135; 5 U.S.C. 301; 6 
U.S.C. 142; DHS Del. No. 13001, Rev. 01 
(June 2, 2020). 
Subpart A also issued under 5 U.S.C. 552. 
Subpart B also issued under 5 U.S.C. 552a 
and 552 note. 
2. Amend § 5.3 by revising paragraphs 
(a)(2) and (c) to read as follows: 
§ 5.3 Requirements for making requests. 
(a) * * * 
(2) A requester may send their request 
to the Privacy Office, U.S. Department 
of Homeland Security, via the internet 
at https://www.dhs.gov/foia or for any of the Headquarters Offices of the 
Department of Homeland Security listed 
in Appendix A to Subpart 5, or https:// 
www.foia.gov/. Upon request, DHS FOIA public liaisons may facilitate, in 
limited circumstances (e.g., 
incarceration), an alternative method to 
submit requests for requesters who are 
unable to submit electronic requests. 
Please direct such requests to the liaison 
of the Office or DHS Component you 
wish to seek records from, which can be 
found listed in Appendix A to Subpart 
5 or found here: https://www.dhs.gov/ 
foia-contact-information. In addition, if a requester does not know which DHS 
component may maintain responsive 
records to a request, the requester may 
explicitly ask for assistance from the 
DHS Privacy Office with identifying the 
proper component that most likely 
maintains any potential responsive 
records. Upon a request for assistance 
and based on information provided in 
the FOIA request and by the requester, 
the Privacy Office will forward the 
request to the DHS component(s) that it 
determines to be most likely, as of the 
date of the request for information, to 
maintain the records that are sought. 
The Privacy Office will notify the 
requester that it is forwarding the 
request, including identifying the 
component(s) where the request has 
been sent, provide the FOIA Public 
Liaison contact information for the 
respective component(s), and provide 
administrative appeal rights in the 
response. If the requester does not agree 
with the Privacy Office’s determination 
regarding which components would 
likely have records responsive to the 
request, the requester must submit a 
timely appeal of the Privacy Office’s 
determination. Although these are not to

recipient DHS component shall be 
granted the same number of days to 
respond as permitted by 6 CFR 5.4(c) 
and 5.5(a). 
* * * * * 
(c) If a request does not adequately 
describe the records sought, DHS may at 
its discretion either seek additional 
information from the requester, or 
administratively close the request. 
Requests for clarification or more 
information will be made in writing 
electronically whenever possible (either 
via electronic mail or portal message) 
except when DHS requests to speak on 
the phone to discuss the request. If DHS 
communicates via a phone call, DHS 
will summarize the call in a follow up 
electronic mail or portal message. If 
DHS corresponds only electronically via 
electronic mail or portal message, 
requesters must respond to requests for 
additional information also by 
electronic mail or portal message in the 
same medium as the DHS 
correspondence. In order to be 
considered timely, responses to requests 
for additional information must be 
received by electronic mail or portal 
message within 30 working days of the 
electronic mail or portal message 
request for additional information. If the 
requester does not respond to a request 
for additional information within 30 
working days, the request may be 
administratively closed at DHS’s 
discretion. This administrative closure 
does not prejudice the requester’s ability 
to submit a new request for further 
consideration with additional 
information. Upon request, DHS FOIA 
public liaisons may facilitate, in limited 
circumstances (e.g., incarceration), an alternative method to submit requests 
for requesters who are unable to submit 
electronic requests. Please direct such 
requests to the liaison of the Office or 
DHS Component you wish to seek 
records from, which can be found listed 
in Appendix A to Subpart 5 or found 
here: https://www.dhs.gov/foia-contact- information. 
3. Amend § 5.21 by revising 
paragraphs (a)(6) and (c) to read as 
follows: 
§ 5.21 Requests for access to records. 
(a) * * * 
(6) An individual may send a request 
to the Privacy Office via the internet at 
https://www.dhs.gov/foia for any of the Headquarters Offices of the Department 
of Homeland Security listed Appendix 
A to Subpart 5, or https://www.foia.gov/ 
. Upon request, DHS FOIA public liaisons may facilitate, in limited 
circumstances (e.g., incarceration), an alternative method to submit requests 
for requesters who are unable to submit 
electronic requests. Please direct such 
requests to the liaison of the Office or 
DHS Component you wish to seek 
records from, which can be found listed 
in Appendix A to Subpart 5 or here: 
https://www.dhs.gov/foia-contact- 
information. In addition, if a requester does not know which DHS component 
may maintain responsive records to a 
request, the requester may explicitly ask 
for assistance from the DHS Privacy 
Office with identifying the proper 
component that most likely maintains 
any potential responsive records citing 
this section of the regulations. Upon a 
request for assistance and based on 
information provided in the FOIA 
request and by the requester, the Privacy 
Office will forward the request to the 
DHS component(s) that it determines to 
be most likely, as of the date of the 
request for information, to maintain the 
records that are sought. The Privacy 
Office will notify the requester that it is 
forwarding the request, including 
identifying the component(s) where the 
request has been sent, provide the FOIA 
Public Liaison contact information for 
the respective component(s), and 
provide administrative appeal rights in 
the response. If the requester does not 
agree with the Privacy Office’s 
determination regarding which 
components would likely have records 
responsive to the request, the requester 
must submit a timely appeal of the 
Privacy Office’s determination. For the 
quickest possible handling, the 
requester should mark the request letter 
‘‘Privacy Act Request’’ or ‘‘Judicial 
Redress Act Request.’’ 
* * * * * 
(c) Description of records sought. A requester must describe the records 
sought in sufficient detail to enable 
Department personnel to locate the 
system of records covering them with a 
reasonable amount of effort. Whenever 
possible, the request should describe the 
records sought, the time periods in 
which the requester believes they were 
compiled, the office or location in 
which the requester believes the records 
are kept, and the name or identifying 
number of each system of records in 
which the requester believes they are 
kept. The Department publishes notices 
in the Federal Register that describe its 
components’ systems of records. These 
notices can be found on the 
Department’s website here: https://
www.dhs.gov/system-records-notices- 
sorns. If a request does not adequately describe the records sought, DHS may at 
its discretion either seek additional 
information from the requester or 
administratively close the request. 
Requests for clarification or more 
information must be made in writing via 
electronic mail. To be considered 
timely, responses to requests for 
additional information must be received 
by electronic mail within 30 working 
days of the electronic mail request for 
additional information. If the requester 
does not respond timely, the request 
may be administratively closed at DHS’s 
discretion. This administrative closure 
does not prejudice the requester’s ability 
to submit a new request for further 
consideration with additional 
information.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
A. Statutory and Regulatory Background 
for Enterprise Housing Goals 
The Federal Housing Enterprises 
Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 
1992 (Safety and Soundness Act) 
requires FHFA to establish several 
annual housing goals for both single- 
family and multifamily mortgages 
purchased by the Enterprises.
1
The 
annual housing goals are one measure of 
the extent to which the Enterprises are 
meeting their public purposes as 
defined by statute, which include ‘‘an 
affirmative obligation to facilitate the 
financing of affordable housing for low- 
and moderate-income families in a 
manner consistent with their overall 
public purposes, while maintaining a 
strong financial condition and a 
reasonable economic return.’’
2
 
FHFA establishes annual housing 
goals for Enterprise purchases of single- 
family and multifamily mortgages 
consistent with the requirements of the 
Safety and Soundness Act. The 
structure of the housing goals and the 
parameters for determining how 
mortgage purchases are counted or not 
counted towards the goals are defined in 
FHFA’s Enterprise housing goals 
regulation.
3
This final rule establishes 
benchmark levels for the single-family 
and multifamily housing goals for 2026– 
2028. 
Single-family housing goals. The 
single-family housing goals defined 
under the Safety and Soundness Act 
include separate categories for home 
purchase mortgages for low-income 
families, very low-income families, and 
families that reside in low-income 
areas.
4
For purposes of the single-family 
housing goals, families that reside in 
low-income areas
5
include: (1) families 
in low-income census tracts, defined as 
census tracts with median income less 
than or equal to 80 percent of area 
median income (AMI);
6
(2) families 
with incomes less than or equal to 100 
percent of AMI who reside in minority 
census tracts (defined as census tracts 
with a minority population of at least 30 
percent and a tract median income of 
less than 100 percent of AMI);
7
and (3) 
families with incomes less than or equal 
to 100 percent of AMI who reside in 
designated disaster areas.
8
The current 
Enterprise housing goals regulation also 
includes subgoals
9
within the low- 
income areas home purchase goal.
10
 
Performance on the single-family home 
purchase goals and subgoals is 
measured as the percentage of the total 
home purchase mortgages purchased by 
an Enterprise each year that qualify for 
each goal or subgoal. There is also a 
separate goal for single-family refinance 
mortgages for low-income families, and 
performance on the refinance goal is 
determined in a similar way. 
Under the Safety and Soundness Act, 
the single-family housing goals are 
limited to mortgages on owner-occupied 
housing with one to four units. The 
single-family goals cover first lien, 
conventional, conforming mortgages, 
meaning mortgages that are not 
subordinate to other mortgage liens, that 
are not insured or guaranteed by the 
Federal Housing Administration or 
another government agency, and that 
have principal balances that do not 
exceed the conforming loan limits for 
Enterprise mortgages. 
Multifamily housing goals. The 
multifamily housing goals defined 
under the Safety and Soundness Act

See 12 CFR 1282.12(e). The low-income areas home purchase goal benchmark level for 2025 is 21

include separate categories for 
mortgages on multifamily properties 
(properties with five or more units) with 
rental units affordable to low-income 
and very low-income families. The 
Safety and Soundness Act also requires 
reporting on smaller properties.
11
The 
multifamily housing goals generally 
include all Enterprise multifamily 
mortgage purchases, regardless of the 
purpose of the loan. The multifamily 
housing goals evaluate the performance 
of the Enterprises based on the share of 
affordable units in properties that serve 
as collateral for mortgages purchased by 
an Enterprise (loans that are excluded as 
ineligible under 12 CFR 1282.16(b) are 
not counted for purposes of measuring 
Enterprise performance). The Enterprise 
housing goals regulation does not 
include a retrospective market level 
measure for the multifamily housing 
goals, due in part to a lack of 
comprehensive data about the 
multifamily market. As a result, FHFA 
measures Enterprise multifamily 
housing goals performance against the 
benchmark levels only and the final rule 
retains this approach. 
The Safety and Soundness Act 
requires that affordability for rental 
units under the multifamily housing 
goals be determined based on rents that 
‘‘[do] not exceed 30 percent of the 
maximum income level of such income 
category, with appropriate adjustments 
for unit size as measured by the number 
of bedrooms.’’
12
The Enterprise housing 
goals regulation considers the net rent 
paid by the renter, i.e., the rent is decreased by any subsidy payments that 
the renter may receive, including 
housing assistance payments.
13
 
B. Considerations After Publication of 
the Final Rule 
If, after publication of this final rule, 
new information indicates that any of 
the single-family or multifamily housing 
goals or subgoals should be adjusted in 
light of market conditions or the safety 
and soundness of the Enterprises, or for 
any other reason, FHFA may take any 
steps that are necessary and appropriate 
to respond, consistent with the Safety 
and Soundness Act and the Enterprise 
housing goals regulation. 
For example, under the Safety and 
Soundness Act and the Enterprise 
housing goals regulation, FHFA is 
permitted to reduce a benchmark level 
in response to an Enterprise petition for 
reduction for any of the single-family or 
multifamily housing goals or subgoals in 
a particular year. Any adjustment in 
response to such a petition must be 
based on a determination by FHFA that: 
(1) market and economic conditions or 
the financial condition of the Enterprise 
require a reduction; or (2) efforts to meet 
the goal or subgoal would result in the 
constraint of liquidity, over-investment 
in certain market segments, or other 
consequences contrary to the intent of 
the Safety and Soundness Act or the 
purposes of the Enterprises’ charter 
acts.
14
The Safety and Soundness Act 
and the Enterprise housing goals 
regulation also consider the possibility 
that achievement of a particular housing 
goal or subgoal may or may not have 
been feasible for an Enterprise. If FHFA 
determines that a housing goal or 
subgoal was not feasible for an 
Enterprise to achieve, then the statute 
and regulation do not require any 
further action related to that housing 
goal or subgoal for that year.
15
If FHFA 
determines that an Enterprise did not 
meet a housing goal or subgoal and that 
achievement of the housing goal or 
subgoal was feasible, then the statute 
and regulation provide FHFA with 
discretionary authority to require the 
Enterprise to submit a housing plan 
describing the specific actions the 
Enterprise will take to improve its 
housing goals performance.
16
 
II. Summary of Final Rule 
A. Benchmark Levels for the Single- 
Family Housing Goals and Subgoal 
This final rule establishes the 
benchmark levels for the single-family 
housing goals for 2026–2028 as follows: 
Goal or subgoal Criteria Current 
benchmark 
level for 
2025–2027 
(percent) 
Final 
benchmark 
level for 
2026–2028 
(percent) 
Low-Income Home Purchase Goal 
(LIP).
Home purchase mortgages on single-family, owner-occupied properties, 
to borrowers with incomes no greater than 80 percent of area median 
income (AMI).
25.0 21.0 
Very Low-Income Home Purchase 
Goal (VLIP).
Home purchase mortgages on single-family, owner-occupied properties, 
to borrowers with incomes no greater than 50 percent of AMI.
6.0 3.5 
Low-Income Refinance Goal (LIR) .. Refinance mortgages on single-family, owner-occupied properties, to 
borrowers with incomes no greater than 80 percent of AMI.
26.0 21.0 
Low-Income Areas Home Purchase 
Subgoal (LIA).
Home purchase mortgages on single-family, owner-occupied properties 
with: 
N/A 16.0 
€Borrowers in census tracts with tract median income of no greater than 80 percent of area median income; or 
€Borrowers with income no greater than 100 percent of area median income in census tracts where (i) tract income is less than 100 per-
cent of area median income, and (ii) minorities comprise at least 
30 percent of the tract population. 
The final rule combines the current 
low-income census tracts home 
purchase subgoal and the minority 
census tracts home purchase subgoal 
into a single low-income areas home 
purchase subgoal. The benchmark level 
for the low-income areas home purchase 
goal is the sum of the benchmark levels 
for the low-income areas home purchase 
subgoal, plus an additional amount that 
will be determined separately by FHFA 
that takes into account families in 
disaster areas with incomes no greater 
than 100 percent of AMI.

income areas home purchase goal is

To simplify the structure of the 
Enterprise housing goals regulation, 
FHFA is removing the temporary 
measurement buffers for the housing 
goals that the Agency previously 
established for 2025–2027. The 
measurement buffers were established 
to encourage the Enterprises to focus on 
achieving certain single-family housing 
goals by meeting the market level, if the 
benchmark level turns out to be higher 
than the market level. These 
measurement buffers partly addressed 
the uncertainty in forecasting the market 
several years in advance as well as the 
time lag in determining the actual 
market level retrospectively. Since the 
2026–2028 benchmarks are set below 
the forecasted marketed level, FHFA 
expects that the Enterprises will be able 
to calibrate their mortgage purchase 
strategies to anticipate small 
fluctuations in market uncertainty, 
making it unnecessary to maintain an 
additional regulatory buffer. This 
accomplishes the original intent of the 
measurement buffers, rendering the 
buffers duplicative and unnecessary. 
B. Benchmark Levels for the Multifamily 
Housing Goals and Subgoal 
The final rule establishes the 
benchmark levels for the multifamily 
housing goals and subgoal for 2026– 
2028 as follows: 
Goal and subgoal Criteria Current 
benchmark 
level for 
2025–2027 
(percent) 
Final 
benchmark 
level for 
2026–2028 
(percent) 
Low-Income Goal ............................. Percentage share of all goal-eligible units in multifamily properties fi-
nanced by mortgages purchased by the Enterprises in the year that 
are affordable to low-income families, defined as families with in-
comes less than or equal to 80 percent of AMI.
61.0 61.0 
Very Low-Income Goal .................... Percentage share of all goal-eligible units in multifamily properties fi-
nanced by mortgages purchased by the Enterprises in the year that 
are affordable to very low-income families, defined as families with in-
comes less than or equal to 50 percent of AMI.
14.0 14.0 
Small Multifamily Low-Income 
Subgoal.
Percentage share of all goal-eligible units in all multifamily properties fi-
nanced by mortgages purchased by the Enterprises in the year that 
are units in small multifamily properties affordable to low-income fam-
ilies, defined as families with incomes less than or equal to 80 per-
cent of AMI.
2.0 2.0 
C. Required Adjustments to Maximum 
Civil Money Penalty Amounts 
The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation 
Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 
2015
19
(Adjustment Improvements Act) 
requires FHFA to adjust the level of 
civil monetary penalties for inflation 
(including an initial catch-up 
adjustment and annual adjustments 
thereafter). The final rule makes explicit 
that the required inflation adjustments 
apply to civil money penalties described 
in section 1345 of the Safety and 
Soundness Act (12 U.S.C. 4585), 
including penalties applicable to the 
Enterprise and Federal Home Loan Bank 
housing goals. 
D. Notice of Preliminary Determination 
of Compliance With Housing Goals 
To streamline the housing goal 
compliance determination processes, 
this final rule requires the Director to 
provide written notice to an Enterprise 
of a preliminary determination only if 
an Enterprise has failed to meet a 
housing goal or subgoal. 
E. Technical Changes 
The final rule also makes technical 
changes to the names of the single- 
family housing goals to distinguish 
between goals related to home purchase 
mortgages and the goal related to 
refinance mortgages. 
III. Overview of Comments 
On October 2, 2025, FHFA published 
a notice of proposed rulemaking 
(proposed rule) in the Federal Register 
(90 FR 47632) proposing single-family 
and multifamily housing goals for 2026– 
2028. Public comments were accepted 
between October 2nd and November 
3rd, 2025. 
FHFA received 19 comments in 
response to the proposed rule, which 
are published on FHFA’s website.
20
Of 
these, 18 include substantial comments 
about the topics in the proposed rule. 
The comments submitted include letters 
from four individuals, six nonprofit 
policy advocacy groups, and nine trade 
associations. Six comment letters were 
signed by coalitions of organizations. 
Five comments were in favor of the 
proposed rule, nine were not in favor, 
and four comments expressed mixed 
support. Three trade associations and 
two individuals generally supported the 
rule due to its anticipated benefits for 
middle-income borrowers and low- 
income renters, as well as its potential 
to reduce market distortions and 
regulatory burdens. Policy advocacy 
groups and one trade group generally 
opposed the rule because they believe it 
would reduce support for low- to 
moderate-income borrowers. Four trade 
groups supported parts of the proposed 
rule, such as the multifamily 
benchmarks, but opposed different parts 
of the single-family benchmarks. Several 
comments related to topics outside of 
the scope of rulemaking including 
recommendations for manufactured 
housing policy activity and legislative 
proposals to address housing 
affordability. Comments received and 
FHFA’s responses are summarized by 
topic below.

Details on FHFA’s single-family market models 
are available in the technical report ‘‘The Size of the 
Affordable Mortgage Market: 2025–2027 Enterprise 
Single-Family Housing Goals,’’ (December 2024),

12-2024. 
IV. Single-Family Housing Goals and 
Subgoal 
A. Factors Considered in Setting the 
Single-Family Housing Goal Benchmark 
Levels 
The Safety and Soundness Act 
requires FHFA to consider the following 
seven factors in setting the single-family 
housing goals: 
1. National housing needs; 
2. Economic, housing, and 
demographic conditions, including 
expected market developments; 
3. The performance and effort of the 
Enterprises toward achieving the 
housing goals in previous years; 
4. The ability of the Enterprises to 
lead the industry in making mortgage 
credit available; 
5. Such other reliable mortgage data 
as may be available; 
6. The size of the purchase money 
conventional mortgage market, or 
refinance conventional mortgage 
market, as applicable, serving each of 
the types of families described, relative 
to the size of the overall purchase 
money mortgage market or the overall 
refinance mortgage market, respectively; 
and 
7. The need to maintain the sound 
financial condition of the Enterprises.
21
 
FHFA has considered each of these 
seven statutory factors in setting the 
benchmark levels for each of the single- 
family housing goals in this final rule. 
FHFA also has considered each of the 
comments received in response to the 
proposed rule, as discussed in more 
detail below 
FHFA’s analysis of the single-family 
housing goals depends in part on a 
market forecast model developed by 
FHFA. The most recently developed 
models, published in December 2024, 
relied on 20 years of HMDA data, from 
2004 to 2023, the latest year for which 
public HMDA data was available when 
the proposed rule was issued. FHFA 
also uses Moody’s Analytics forecasts 
data as the primary data source for the 
model’s independent or driver variables. 
Additional discussion of the most recent 
market forecast models can be found in 
a technical report on FHFA’s website.
22
 
B. National Housing Needs and 
Economic, Housing, and Demographic 
Conditions 
FHFA received several comments 
from national advocacy groups and 
individuals on the current state of 
housing affordability, racial disparities 
in lending, and threats to economic 
sustainability in the United States. Two 
commenters argued that the lower 
benchmarks would improve affordable 
housing, strengthen communities, and 
reduce inequality. However, most 
commenters contended that the lower 
benchmarks would widen gaps in 
affordable housing availability and 
increase financial hardship for low- to 
moderate-income borrowers. Some 
commenters claimed that FHFA asserted 
that mission focused lending 
undermines safety and soundness. 
These commenters argued FHFA should 
not prioritize recapitalization over 
equitable access to capital and the 
public interest. Furthermore, advocacy 
groups stated that the nation faces a 
housing affordability crisis compounded 
by a fair housing crisis, both of which 
exacerbate challenges for borrowers. 
Commenters provided evidence that 
racial homeownership gaps remain as 
wide today as in 1968 and cited ongoing 
redlining, exclusionary zoning laws, 
and labor market discrimination. 
Other commenters, including trade 
associations, praised FHFA’s efforts to 
enhance the supply of affordable 
housing and promote efficiency and 
innovation in the housing market. 
Specifically, trade associations 
supported FHFA’s focus on housing 
supply in the proposed rule. They 
argued that the Enterprises should 
reconsider deployment of housing goal 
subsides to address drivers of housing 
affordability issues. Some policy 
advocacy groups, however, rejected the 
notion that current affordable housing 
supply conditions justify a reduction in 
goals, emphasizing that the Enterprises 
have a mandate to support borrowers 
regardless of housing supply levels. 
The Agency also received comments 
on the proposed rule’s impact on first- 
time homebuyers. Advocacy groups 
noted that homeownership remains out 
of reach for borrowers across all income 
levels, emphasizing that single-family 
home prices have risen faster than 
median incomes in nearly all 
metropolitan areas. They urged FHFA 
not to reduce the single-family 
benchmarks, emphasizing that 
Enterprise-backed mortgages represent 
important opportunities for first-time 
homebuyers. Advocacy groups further 
expressed concern that persistent 
drivers of wealth inequality, such as 
exposure to natural disasters and 
worsening macroeconomic conditions, 
continue to disproportionately affect 
low- to moderate-income communities, 
and cautioned that the single-family 
benchmarks should not be set at levels 
that could exacerbate disparities among 
borrowers. 
FHFA also received comments in 
favor of its broad efforts to better serve 
middle- and working-class Americans. 
Trade organizations praised FHFA for 
acknowledging the past evidence of 
‘‘denominator management’’ and other 
market distortions that negatively 
impact middle class borrowers and 
supported FHFA’s proposed efforts to 
negate these effects. Other commenters 
argued that the regulation does not 
expand access to housing credit for all 
borrowers, but, instead, primarily 
benefits wealthier households. Some 
policy advocacy groups also challenged 
FHFA’s belief that the rule, if finalized 
as proposed, will better support middle- 
income borrowers, noting that the 
current housing goals already target this 
group and that reducing the benchmarks 
undermines the regulation’s intended 
objective. Commenters emphasized that 
middle-income borrowers should be 
supported by the Enterprises in all 
economic cycles and across all regions, 
and argued that the proposed 
benchmarks do not achieve this goal. 
Additionally, advocacy groups 
criticized FHFA for not providing 
sufficient quantitative evidence to 
support the assertion that moderate- 
income households will face increasing 
obstacles to homeownership due to 
competition among millennials 
pursuing first-time homeownership. 
FHFA acknowledges the nation’s 
affordable housing crisis, and believes 
that finalizing the proposed rule will be 
a meaningful step toward addressing 
these challenges for Americans. The 
rule accounts for the limited supply of 
affordable housing and establishes 
benchmark levels designed to prevent 
unfair market distortions, such as 
discouraging or denying access to 
mortgages for credit-eligible applicants 
in order to meet housing goals targets. 
The lower single-family benchmarks are 
also intended to help mitigate potential 
price escalation that could 
disproportionately harm affordability 
for goal-eligible populations. 
Furthermore, the proposed benchmarks 
will enable the Enterprises to focus their 
efforts on developing products and 
resources that better support first-time 
homeownership and enhance 
affordability, rather than competing in a 
bidding war over a limited supply of 
goal-qualifying loans. FHFA finds that 
the proposed rule, once finalized, will 
likely expand access to mortgage credit 
for approximately 201,000 additional 
goal-eligible borrowers who otherwise 
might not obtain mortgage financing. 
Therefore, FHFA concurs with 
commenters who argue that the lower

share of non-Agency originations (retained 
portfolio, PLS market, etc.) has grown. 
single-family benchmarks will improve 
housing affordability and reduce 
inequalities for Americans. 
The Agency is committed to ensuring 
non-discriminatory access to mortgage 
credit across the nation and works to 
ensure that fair lending laws and 
requirements are followed by all of its 
regulated entities. However, FHFA 
disagrees that the setting of housing goal 
benchmarks has direct impact on 
redlining, exclusionary zoning laws, or 
labor market discrimination. Rather, the 
Agency’s policy is to ensure that all 
households have equal access regardless 
of race and ethnicity. Over the past year, 
the Agency has overseen and supported 
efforts by the Enterprises to make 
housing more affordable, including, for 
example, through down payment and 
closing cost assistance to very low- 
income borrowers, enhanced free 
borrower education, and modern 
underwriting that considers a 
borrower’s rental payment history and 
cash flow. 
While the rule is designed to support 
low- to moderate-income borrowers in 
light of ongoing affordability and fair 
lending challenges, FHFA emphasizes 
that other market participants also play 
a vital role in advancing affordable 
housing. State Housing Finance 
Agencies (HFAs), the Rural Housing 
Service (RHS), the Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA), and the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are 
among the government entities that help 
provide liquidity and access to credit for 
low- to moderate-income borrowers. 
These organizations are often able to 
offer more favorable products tailored to 
the unique needs of these borrowers. As 
noted above and in the preamble to the 
proposed rule, the final rule ensures 
that benchmark levels are calibrated to 
avoid crowding out government entities 
and other sources of mortgage liquidity, 
thereby fostering a balanced and 
coordinated effort to expand affordable 
housing opportunities. 
Lastly, FHFA finds that, given current 
affordability challenges and heightened 
market uncertainty, it would be 
imprudent to set benchmarks at overly 
aggressive levels. To maintain 
compliance with statutory safety and 
soundness requirements and to promote 
long-term housing market stability, 
FHFA believes it is essential to establish 
benchmark levels that strengthen the 
Enterprises’ financial positions while 
continuing to ensure that low- and 
moderate-income families are effectively 
served. 
C. Performance and Effort of the 
Enterprises in Achieving Housing Goals 
in Previous Years 
Commenters representing industry 
trade organizations supported the 
Agency’s position regarding the 
potential for past goals to have been too 
aggressive and beyond the capacity of 
available supply in the market. In their 
view, the primary issue is the limited 
supply of affordable homes, and an 
over-emphasis on the demand side of 
the equation (high goal benchmarks) has 
historically led to market distortions 
and ‘‘gamesmanship,’’ including an 
extreme bidding war for goal-qualifying 
loans. 
Commenters specifically referenced 
past market data and FHFA’s own 2024 
determination that the 2023 low-income 
and very low-income home purchase 
goals were not feasible to achieve. They 
posit that FHFA’s failure to reset these 
benchmarks resulted in the Enterprises 
engaging in the kind of competition that 
the proposed rule noted produces 
market distortions, such as pricing 
increases or managing down the 
‘‘denominator’’ of total loans purchased. 
These commenters largely supported 
the proposed benchmarks, believing 
they were appropriately set at the low 
end of model confidence intervals or 
just below model estimates. They 
viewed this level as providing necessary 
flexibility for the Enterprises to respond 
to the market while maintaining their 
statutory obligations. The ultimate 
measure of success, they argued, should 
be the real-world impact on affordability 
and household sustainability, not just 
meeting a numerical loan production 
target. A commenter further noted that 
aggressive goal setting can inadvertently 
increase housing costs. 
Conversely, many commenters 
disagreed that the Enterprises are 
crowding out other market participants 
and that their actions may lead to 
market distortion, stating that no 
evidence was presented. A commenter 
asserted that any perceived 
inefficiencies may lie in the Enterprises’ 
underwriting and pricing frameworks, 
not in the goals themselves, and that 
updating those frameworks could 
strengthen liquidity for lenders while 
maintaining robust goals. 
FHFA appreciates the thoughtful 
comments regarding the historical 
impact of setting housing goal 
benchmarks and the suggestions for 
improving the measurement of goal 
success. The Agency concurs with 
commenters who observed that 
aggressive goal setting in the past, where 
targets exceeded the available supply in 
the market, resulted in market 
distortions and bidding wars that 
ultimately do not benefit the 
homebuyer. This aligns with FHFA’s 
rationale that benchmarks set 
inappropriately high penalizes middle- 
class borrowers and creates an 
inefficient subsidy mechanism. The 
Agency’s determination that the 2023 
low-income and very low-income goals 
were infeasible further reinforces the 
need for realistic, achievable targets. 
FHFA also agrees that the housing 
goals should increase affordability and 
promote sustainable homeownership, 
not simply meet a numerical target. The 
proposed recalibration of the Enterprise 
housing goals is warranted to address 
the concern, as detailed in the proposed 
rule and reiterated in this final rule, that 
past benchmarks were too high, which 
hindered the efficient deployment of 
funds. The new benchmarks are 
designed to provide the necessary 
flexibility for the Enterprises to respond 
to market conditions, meet their 
statutory obligations, and facilitate a 
thorough examination of lending 
patterns without causing undue market 
distortion. 
The Agency finds merit in the 
suggestion to focus on loan performance 
as an integral measure of housing goal 
success. Ensuring loan sustainability is 
directly tied to FHFA’s core 
responsibility to maintain the safety and 
soundness of the housing finance 
system. FHFA will examine 
incorporating household sustainability 
factors into future goal credit 
calculations or performance 
assessments. 
Regarding the comment that 
questioned the evidence of 
‘‘denominator management,’’ FHFA 
relies on its analysis of how the 
Enterprises’ pricing mechanisms and 
operational efforts, when driven by high 
benchmarks, can lead to the 
displacement of private capital and 
distort competition with other federal 
entities and harm middle-income 
borrowers. As noted in the proposed 
rule and the Regulatory Impact 
Analysis, FHFA notes that the non- 
Enterprise market segment
23
has 
experienced a growth in their share of 
goal-eligible loans since 2022, while the 
Enterprises acquisitions declined, 
potentially indicating ‘‘denominator 
management.’’ 
FHFA aims to encourage the 
Enterprises to reassess the deployment

of housing goal subsidies to more 
effectively address the underlying 
drivers of housing affordability. As 
described in the proposed rule and the 
Regulatory Impact Analysis, current 
benchmarks have contributed to bidding 
wars and market distortions over a 
limited housing supply. Housing supply 
conditions therefore directly affect the 
statutory factors FHFA must consider 
when setting benchmarks, including, 
but not limited to: the Enterprises’ 
ability to fulfill public needs; their 
leadership role in the mortgage 
industry; and their support of safe and 
sound mortgage practices. Accordingly, 
FHFA finds that current and forecasted 
housing supply conditions may justify a 
reduction in goals, as affordable housing 
supply is part of the statutory 
considerations for benchmark-setting. 
As noted previously in the preamble 
to the proposed rule and the Regulatory 
Impact Analysis, FHFA continues to 
believe that finalizing the proposed rule 
will expand access to housing credit for 
all borrowers. Critiques suggesting that 
the rule primarily benefits wealthier 
borrowers are unfounded. Goal-eligible 
loans exclude borrowers in the highest 
income brackets, such as investors and 
mortgages exceeding the conforming 
loan limit. Moreover, the Enterprises 
remain incentivized to meet statutory 
requirements for low- and moderate- 
income borrowers, as failure to comply 
could result in penalties. Lenders are 
also likely to continue originating loans 
to low- and moderate-income borrowers 
due to pay-ups (premiums) in secondary 
market trading and because these loans 
represent a significant and profitable 
segment of the homebuying market. 
FHFA finds that finalizing the 
proposed rule will better support 
middle-income borrowers compared to 
the current rule. While the same number 
of goal-qualifying borrowers will be 
served, the proposed rule reduces the 
likelihood of turning away middle- 
income borrowers who do not fit a goal- 
qualifying definition solely to meet a 
ratio of goal-qualifying to goal-eligible 
borrowers. According to FHFA’s 
regulatory impact analysis, finalizing 
the proposed rule is expected to result 
in an increase of 201,000 loans to goal- 
eligible borrowers, with the largest gains 
likely for middle-income households. 
As described in the proposed rule, 
FHFA considers demographic factors as 
part of its post-model adjustment 
process to identify appropriate 
benchmarks based on model forecasts. 
One of the factors discussed was a 
potential significant increase in demand 
compared to the baseline forecasts due 
to indications that millennials are 
driving increased competition for 
moderate-income homeownership 
opportunities. According to NAR’s 
Home Buyers and Sellers Generational 
Trends 2025 report and a Michigan 
Journal of Economics survey, 
millennials represent the largest share 
(29%) of recent homebuyers,
24
signaling 
current demand, and 55% are expected 
to inherit wealth over the next five 
years, indicating future demand.
25
 
Furthermore, the Joint Center for 
Housing Studies’ 2025 report projects 
that the number of households aged 35– 
44 will grow by 3.0 million between 
2025 and 2035. FHFA therefore finds it 
likely that an increasing number of 
moderate-income borrowers will seek 
homeownership and will likely benefit 
from the proposed rule. FHFA is 
committed to monitoring the impact of 
the final benchmarks to ensure 
borrowers across all economic cycles 
and regions are supported. 
D. Ability To Lead the Industry in 
Making Mortgage Credit Available 
Many commenters asserted that the 
Enterprises have a statutory mandate to 
serve low- to moderate-income 
borrowers and communities and to lead 
the industry in making mortgage credit 
available. Commenters cited the 
Enterprises’ public missions and the 
requirements under the Safety and 
Soundness Act, which includes a 
specific factor for FHFA to consider in 
setting goals: the Enterprises’ ability to 
lead the market in supporting access to 
mortgage credit.
26
These commenters 
contend that Congress mandates the 
Enterprises to lead the industry in 
making mortgage credit available for 
low- and moderate-income borrowers. 
Many of the commenters believe that 
these goals, as proposed, would not 
fulfill this mandate. 
Several commenters also disagreed 
with the rationale in the proposed rule 
that suggests it may be inappropriate for 
the Enterprises to have an outsized 
market share in mortgage lending to 
low- to moderate-income or that the 
Enterprises should cede their market 
share to allow for other industry 
participants. Some commenters 
expressed concern that the proposed 
benchmarks over-emphasize middle- 
income borrowers at the expense of low- 
to moderate-income borrowers. 
Commenters disputed the Agency’s 
suggestion that other federal 
government programs (FHA, VA, and 
USDA/RHS), state Housing Finance 
Agency (HFA) programs, or the private- 
label securities (PLS) market could serve 
to make mortgage credit available for 
low- to moderate-income borrowers. 
Commenters explained that VA and 
USDA loans have statutory eligibility 
restrictions that limit their availability, 
and one commenter expressed concern 
that a reduction in the benchmark may 
‘‘create a credit gap for households on 
the margin of eligibility for both 
programs.’’ Furthermore, commenters 
noted that although FHA serves a wider 
segment of the market, these loans are 
generally more expensive for many 
creditworthy households due to higher 
upfront and ongoing costs in the form of 
a higher mortgage insurance premium, 
and interest rate, as well as the lifetime 
nature of the mortgage insurance. 
Commenters note that similar borrowers 
who qualify for a conventional mortgage 
are able to use Enterprise loan products 
often receive lower interest rates and 
cancelable mortgage insurance, reducing 
the lifetime costs of the mortgage. 
Commenters contended that bank 
balance sheets cannot be expected to fill 
the gap, as banks already receive full 
Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) 
credit for loans sold to the Enterprises 
and have no reason to increase the share 
of low- to moderate-income loans they 
hold on balance sheet. Commenters 
pointed out that the PLS market is 
cyclical and historically has primarily 
funded mortgages to higher-income 
borrowers, with the one exception being 
the subprime lending boom preceding 
the 2008 financial crisis. Rather, a 
commenter noted, the PLS market is 
highly sensitive to global capital flows, 
and during times of credit pressure 
(such as the 2008 global financial crisis 
and the 2020–2021 coronavirus 
pandemic) the PLS market has either 
ceased to function, or fully withdrew 
from participating in the market. At 
these times, only government lending 
and the Enterprises remained to 
stabilize the mortgage market. Concern 
was also raised that supporting PLS 
market growth is not a mandate in 
statute and raises market stability 
concerns. 
A few commenters agreed with the 
underlying principle that the 
Enterprises should not be the sole 
source of mortgage liquidity and that 
pricing should determine the extent of 
their reach. These commenters noted

As noted above, Graph 4 to the proposed rule 
provides the shares of the conforming mortgage 
market for all new originations; the Graph shows 
that since 2022, the share of non-Agency 
originations (retained portfolio, PLS market, etc.) 
has grown. 
that while it is appropriate for the 
Enterprises to increase market share in 
periods of market stress or periods of 
retreat by other market participants to 
ensure credit availability, when the 
private markets are operating in a 
healthy manner, the Enterprises can and 
should reduce market share. Several 
commenters, including industry groups, 
supported the notion that goals should 
be set at an appropriate level to avoid 
market distortions and prevent the 
Enterprises from crowding out private 
sector participants. 
A different set of commenters offered 
a criticism of past goals, arguing that 
setting them too low led to a sharp 
growth in volume for FHA, VA, and 
RHS programs, and simultaneously 
reduced private capital participation 
through instruments like private 
mortgage insurance and credit risk 
transfers. In their view, goals set too low 
concentrate risk with the federal 
government, which runs counter to the 
Congressional objective for the 
Enterprises to share risk with private 
capital providers. These commentators 
expressed a preference for an 
appropriate level of private capital to be 
deployed in the low- to moderate- 
income space, arguing this would 
increase affordability and efficiency 
while reducing dependence on Federal 
government support. 
FHFA appreciates the commenters’ 
detailed feedback regarding the 
statutory mission of the Enterprises and 
their role in the secondary mortgage 
market. The Agency acknowledges the 
Enterprises’ fundamental statutory 
mandate to serve all borrowers, 
including low- to moderate-income 
borrowers and communities throughout 
the country. FHFA believes that the rule 
is designed to ensure that the 
Enterprises fulfill this statutory purpose 
while ensuring that all borrowers have 
equal access to a liquid secondary 
market, and balancing safety and 
soundness. FHFA disagrees that the 
benchmarks are at odds with this 
important role. 
FHFA also notes that the Director is 
required by statute to establish goal 
targets by considering both historical 
performance and a number of statutory 
factors. One of these factors is ‘‘the 
ability of the enterprise to lead the 
industry in making mortgage credit 
available.’’
27
This factor does not mean 
that the Enterprises must lead the 
industry; rather, the Enterprises’ ability 
to lead the industry is one of several 
factors considered in conjunction with 
historical performance in setting goals. 
FHFA believes that the goal setting 
methodology described in the preamble 
to the proposed rule follows the 
statutory framework by considering all 
the required factors to set benchmarks 
that reflect the policy priorities of the 
Director. 
FHFA agrees with the commenters 
who believe that the Enterprises should 
not be the sole source of mortgage credit 
liquidity, particularly for low- to 
moderate-income borrowers. The 
Agency maintains a policy interest in 
ensuring the Enterprises do not crowd 
out other market participants and 
intends to use the flexibility provided 
by the new goals to collect and analyze 
comprehensive data to definitively 
assess the relationship between goal 
levels and market behavior, including 
potential pricing inefficiencies. A 
diverse secondary mortgage market— 
one that includes the Enterprises, 
Federal government loan programs, state 
and local Housing Finance Agencies, 
and a robust, sustainable private-label 
securities market—is essential. This 
diversity allows for healthy competition 
that can reduce costs for borrowers, 
foster innovation, and ensure a more 
resilient and reliable supply of liquidity 
across the economic cycle. 
The Agency’s approach is consistent 
with the policy objectives of promoting 
competition, increasing private sector 
participation, and ensuring the 
Enterprises’ role is defined without 
duplicating support provided by the 
Federal Housing Administration or 
other federal programs. Setting goals 
appropriately requires balancing the 
statutory obligation to promote access to 
affordable credit with the need to ensure 
safety and soundness while avoiding 
unnecessary and costly duplication of 
support. The Agency also acknowledges 
the critical need to reduce taxpayer 
exposure to risk and promote private 
capital participation. 
The determination of the final goal 
targets balances the statutory obligation 
to promote access to affordable credit, 
the Enterprises’ ability to lead the 
market, and the need to promote a 
sustainable, liquid, and competitive 
secondary market that includes other 
market participants and private risk- 
sharing mechanisms. The goal levels 
ultimately established are determined to 
provide a sufficient incentive for the 
Enterprises to fulfill their mission to 
low-to moderate-income borrowers and 
serve as leaders in the market while 
encouraging the sustainable growth and 
participation of other, non-Enterprise 
market participants and the appropriate 
deployment of private capital. 
Furthermore, as noted above, FHFA’s 
analysis of past goal performance, where 
Enterprises continued to perform above 
benchmarks even when they were set 
lower, suggests that the Enterprises will 
maintain strong liquidity and outreach 
to low-to moderate-income borrowers, 
as is consistent with their broader 
statutory mission. 
For many low-to moderate-income 
borrowers, the Enterprises are the 
appropriate liquidity providers, for 
others it may be FHA or VA (via Ginnie 
Mae), while still others could be better 
served by the PLS market. It is 
important, however, to clearly 
distinguish between the setting of the 
housing goals benchmarks and the 
selling and underwriting requirements 
of the Enterprises. In response to a 
commenter’s belief that lower 
benchmarks could create a ‘‘credit gap,’’ 
FHFA notes that a reduced benchmark 
is separate and distinct from Enterprise 
business decisions regarding the 
appropriate amount of credit risk; 
further, it is unlikely that an applicant’s 
mortgage that was eligible for purchase 
by the Enterprises would be ineligible 
by FHA. As noted above, FHFA does not 
agree that FHA loans are always a more 
expensive alternative because pricing 
depends on a borrower’s financial 
profile, loan terms, and market 
conditions. FHFA also acknowledges 
that FHA has a clear statutory mandate 
to make homeownership more 
accessible, particularly for low- to 
moderate-income borrowers with low 
down payments. 
It is FHFA’s intent to ensure that the 
Enterprises do not crowd out other 
participants
28
and believes the updated 
benchmarks will encourage their 
involvement. It is also clear that under 
the current housing goals benchmarks, a 
distortive effect is present and FHFA 
believes that the means to correct this is 
to appropriately size the goals to the 
needs of the market. It is with this in 
mind that FHFA seeks to the right-size 
the goals and ensure that all borrowers 
are served appropriately and extended 
credit that fits within a borrower’s need 
and circumstance. As noted earlier, the 
new benchmarks should not be viewed 
as a ceiling for the Enterprises, and the 
Enterprises are still expected to make 
best efforts at serving all segments of the 
market, ensuring they meet their 
affirmative statutory obligations.

Income Purchase Goal Determinations

letters from advocacy groups regarding

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59955 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations the single-family purchase benchmarks. 
All letters focused on the proposed 
reduction of the low-income purchase 
(LIP) benchmark from 25.0 percent to 
21.0 percent, while all but one also 
addressed the proposed reduction of the 
very low-income purchase (VLIP) 
benchmark from 6.0 percent to 3.5 
percent for the years 2026–2028. 
The commenters generally expressed 
concerns that the proposed goals are not 
ambitious enough and fall below current 
market levels, undermining the 
assistance that the Enterprises could 
provide to families in need. They argued 
that these reduced goals could 
jeopardize the statutory mission of the 
Enterprises and significantly limit 
lending opportunities for households 
with incomes up to 80 percent and 50 
percent of area median income for LIP 
and VLIP, respectively. 
Additionally, several commenters 
raised issues with FHFA’s reliance on 
qualitative evidence related to the 
crowding out of other funding sources, 
the increasing costs for middle-income 
borrowers, and the notion that increased 
lending to low and moderate-income 
borrowers could undermine safety and 
soundness. Despite these Agency 
concerns, the commenters argue that 
market data supports maintaining the 
current benchmark levels, which they 
say have consistently been met in 
previous years. The commenters 
advocate for more ambitious goals, 
especially given the ongoing 
affordability challenges in the housing 
market. 
Most of the commenters urged FHFA 
to either maintain the current 
benchmarks or reassess them based on 
additional empirical data, rather than 
qualitative evidence and industry 
sentiment. One of these commenters 
suggested that the Enterprises could 
exceed the current purchase 
benchmarks, requesting increases in 
both LIP and VLIP benchmarks, 
although no specific targets were 
provided. 
In contrast to the commenters 
advocating higher benchmarks, there 
were two letters from industry trade 
groups expressing their appreciation to 
FHFA for its recognition of the potential 
for market distortion and efforts to more 
appropriately calibrate the goals. One of 
these commenters pointed out that the 
LIP and VLIP goals were not feasible to 
achieve for 2023. 
FHFA has thoroughly reviewed the 
comments and decided to retain the 
proposed reductions to both single- 
family purchase goals. This decision is 
based on FHFA’s consideration of each 
of the statutory factors and the 
comments received, as discussed above. 
The Agency reaffirms that while data 
is crucial, qualitative insights from 
stakeholder experience also play an 
essential role in understanding the 
complexities of the mortgage finance 
landscape. These qualitative 
assessments enrich the understanding of 
market dynamics and borrower needs. 
Further, the Agency provided 
quantitative data using the National 
Mortgage Database, noting unexpectedly 
lower acquisitions of goal-eligible loans 
by the Enterprises beginning in 2022, 
which may be explained by 
denominator management strategies 
identified by market participants 
through the qualitative data. The 
Regulatory Impact Analysis estimates 
that in 2024, the Enterprises would have 
acquired an additional 67,000 goal- 
eligible loans per annum without having 
to purchase any fewer housing goal 
qualifying loans. Both qualitative and 
quantitative data provide unique and 
valuable insights into the market. In this 
case, both qualitative and quantitative 
information reinforce the need for FHFA 
to make adjustments to the goals to 
appropriately align incentives with 
desired outcomes. 
FHFA aims to balance market 
dynamics by reconciling the 
Enterprises’ commitment to affordable 
lending with the necessity of providing 
liquidity in the broader market. The 
Agency believes that maintaining these 
revised goals will reduce market 
distortions and mitigate unintended 
consequences while continuing to 
provide robust support for low- to 
moderate-income households. 
Furthermore, FHFA acknowledges the 
current economic realities affecting the 
housing landscape, such as a significant 
decrease in affordable inventory and 
rising costs, necessitating a reevaluation 
of attainable targets. 
With a focus on long-term stability in 
the housing market, FHFA believes that 
implementing lower benchmarks is a 
prudent strategy to ensure the 
Enterprises can operate sustainably 
while protecting their financial health 
and the structural integrity of the 
secondary mortgage market. It is 
important to note that these goals reflect 
minimum requirements, and the Agency 
expects the Enterprises to exceed these 
benchmarks whenever feasible and 
prudent.

FHFA’s final determination of Fannie Mae’s 
performance for 2023, available at https://
www.fhfa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/2023- 
Final-Determination-Letter-Fannie-Mae.pdf. 
Mae’s performance in 2022 was 27.4 
percent, which was below the 
benchmark level but above the market 
level. In 2023, however, Fannie Mae’s 
performance decreased to 26.1 percent, 
falling below both the benchmark and 
the market levels. For 2023, FHFA 
determined that while Fannie Mae did 
not meet the goal, the established 
benchmark was not feasible for the 
Enterprise.
29
For 2024, both Enterprises 
exceeded the market level, with Fannie 
Mae’s performance at 26.7 percent and 
Freddie Mac’s performance at 26.6 
percent.

As detailed in Table 3, the market 
level for the very low-income home 
purchase housing goal, derived from 
HMDA data, decreased from 7.0 percent 
in 2020 to 6.5 percent in 2023. FHFA’s 
most recent forecast projects a 
continued market level decline, 
averaging 6.0 ± 2.5 percent. FHFA’s current model forecasts the market to 
continue its downward trajectory 
reaching below 6 percent through 2027, 
with an average forecast midpoint value 
of 5.9 percent. 
Regarding the Enterprises, both 
Enterprises met the very low-income 
home purchase goal in 2022, with 
Freddie Mac’s performance at 7.1 
percent and Fannie Mae’s performance 
at 6.9 percent. In 2023, Freddie Mac met 
the very low-income home purchase 
goal, with performance at 6.8 percent, 
but Fannie Mae’s performance was 6.0 
percent, which was below both the 
market and the benchmark. For 2024, 
Freddie Mac again met the very low- 
income home purchase goal, while 
Fannie Mae’s performance was 5.9 
percent, below both the market and the 
benchmark. 
The Agency remains committed to its 
statutory mission of promoting 
affordable housing. However, the latest 
available market performance data, 
market forecasts, and Enterprise 
performance all indicate that the current 
benchmark levels for the low-income 
home purchase goal and the very low- 
income home purchase goal are set too 
aggressively. FHFA believes that the 
reductions in the LIP and VLIP goals are 
a necessary strategy to maintain the 
stability of the Enterprises and the 
broader housing market. FHFA values 
the constructive dialogue and insights 
from stakeholders and will continue to 
monitor market conditions closely to 
evaluate the ongoing viability of these 
housing goals. 
F. Low-Income Areas, Minority Census 
Tracts, & Low-Income Census Tracts 
Subgoal Determinations 
The Agency received several 
comments regarding the restoration of 
the low-income areas subgoal, which 
would merge the current minority 
census tracts subgoal and the low- 
income census tracts subgoal. One 
individual supported the restoration of 
the low-income areas subgoal as it 
reduces administrative burden. 
One individual, one trade association, 
two nonprofits, and three policy 
advocacy groups disagreed with the 
proposal to restore the previous subgoal 
and urged FHFA to keep the two area- 
based subgoals separate. They argued 
that given that the Enterprises can meet 
the low-income census tracts segment 
by serving borrowers at any income, 
combining both segments could result 
in greater service to higher-income 
borrowers and reduced focus on lower- 
income homebuyers in minority census 
tracts. One policy advocacy group 
argued that this change could result in 
the Enterprises’ purchasing up to 88,000 
fewer loans in minority census tracts 
from 2026 to 2028. In addition, 
commenters noted that while this 
merger may reduce administrative 
burden, it may make it more difficult to 
track the Enterprises’ performance in 
the minority census tracts. 
As stated in the proposed rule, FHFA 
is restoring the low-income areas 
subgoal to simplify the regulatory 
framework, improve operational clarity 
for the Enterprises, and better align the 
subgoal with existing borrower-based 
metrics. This merger ensures that both 
segments of the subgoal remain 
supported while considering the 
implementation challenges related to 
the current structure. This change also 
advances the Administration’s priorities 
for race neutral policies, and for 
regulatory reform by reducing 
compliance costs, increasing efficiency, 
and reducing regulatory burden. 
Under the current structure, all 
higher-income borrower loans in low- 
income census tracts that are also 
minority census tracts qualify for the 
low-income census tracts subgoal only, 
while the lower-income loans in those 
census tracts qualify for the minority 
census tracts subgoal only. Although 
this separation enables the Enterprises 
to focus on lower-income borrowers in 
census tracts that are both minority and 
low-income in one subgoal (the 
minority census tracts subgoal), it also 
places higher-income loans in those 
census tracts in the other subgoal, 
which increases operational complexity. 
However, a 2020 study of Enterprise 
acquisitions between 2010 and 2019, 
conducted by FHFA, found that under 
the previous structure, when the loans

Under 12 U.S.C. 4544(b)(3), FHFA is required 
to ‘‘aggregate and analyze data on income, race, and 
gender by census tract and other relevant 
classifications, and compare such data with larger 
demographic, housing, and economic trends.’’ See 
FHFA’s 2024 Annual Housing Report, available at

report-2024. 
were not separated as described above, 
the share of loans made to borrowers 
with incomes greater than 100 percent 
of AMI and residing in low-income 
census tracts declined from 40.7 percent 
in 2010 to 37.0 percent in 2019.
30
The 
trend was similar among borrowers 
residing in minority census tracts, with 
the share of higher-income borrowers 
declining from 45.4 percent in 2010 to 
42.9 percent in 2019.
31
The share of 
high-income borrowers peaked between 
2014 and 2016, corresponding with an 
overall increase in loan volume, decline 
in mortgage rates, and expansion of 
credit availability. In the following 
years, FHFA observed an overall decline 
in the share of higher-income borrowers 
that qualified for this housing goal. 
Based on this evidence, and assuming 
that the trend observed during the 2010 
to 2019 study period is representative of 
the subgoal as a whole, there does not 
appear to be any evidence that having 
a combined goal results in reduced 
support for low-income borrowers. 
FHFA believes that the Enterprises will 
continue to support lower-income 
borrowers when borrowers in low- 
income census tracts and minority 
census tracts are served under one 
subgoal. 
Additionally, FHFA notes that the 
public will still be able to track the 
Enterprises’ performance in minority 
census tracts without the minority 
census tracts subgoal. The Enterprises 
provide this information in Tables 7 and 
9 of their Annual Mortgage Reports 
published on their websites.
32
 
Additionally, FHFA publishes 
information on borrower race and 
ethnicity by loan product compared to 
the market in its Annual Housing 
Report.
33
 
Given the operational challenges that 
emerged with the current structure, and 
the evidence of Enterprise behavior 
under the previous structure, FHFA 
believes that it is reasonable and 
prudent to restore the low-income areas 
subgoal as it will reduce administrative 
burden while encouraging the 
Enterprises to focus on supporting 
borrowers in low-income areas.

The numbers in italics refer to FHFA’s tabulations of the market and Enterprise performance had this subgoal been in place from 2022–2024. 
Table 3 shows the market levels and 
Enterprise performance on this subgoal 
in 2021, along with implied market 
levels and Enterprise performance for 
the years 2022 through 2024, during 
which the low-income areas subgoal 
was replaced by the low-income census 
tracts and minority census tracts 
subgoals. As shown above, both 
Enterprises exceeded the proposed 
benchmark level for this subgoal in 
2022, 2023, and 2024. 
Based on the comments received and 
FHFA’s consideration of the statutory 
factors, including the recent 
performance of the Enterprises and the 
market forecasts shown in Table 3, 
FHFA has determined that the 
benchmark level for the low-income 
areas home purchase subgoal should be 
established at the level that was 
proposed by FHFA earlier this year, 16 
percent. 
G. Low-Income Refinance Goal 
Determinations 
The Agency received comments 
regarding the proposal to maintain the 
low-income refinance benchmark level 
at 26.0 percent. A trade organization 
supported FHFA’s proposal to maintain 
the benchmark level as was finalized in 
the 2025–2027 rule, given the segment’s 
sensitivity to interest rates. Another 
trade organization urged FHFA to 
consider lowering the low-income

Refinance activity is significantly more 
sensitive to market interest rate changes than 
mortgages for new home purchases. This is because 
refinancing is discretionary—homeowners only 
proceed when prevailing rates are low enough to 
offer a clear financial benefit over their current 
mortgage. In contrast, purchase money mortgages 
are necessary for a transaction to occur, making 
their volume less sensitive to short-term rate 
fluctuations.

refinance benchmark level—which is 
below the lower bound of the market 
forecast confidence interval—also due 
to the segment’s sensitivity to interest 
rates.
34
They noted that there is a 
potential for a decline in interest rates 
given the Administration’s stated policy 
priorities. They also urged FHFA to 
reinstate the measurement buffer for this 
goal, due to the potential of interest 
rates declining to a level that does not 
support the proposed benchmark level 
(as explained below). 
As noted in the proposed rule, the 
Enterprises’ annual performance on the 
low-income refinance goal tends to be 
inversely proportional to the volume of 
low-income refinance loans the market 
produces and the Enterprises purchase 
during a given year.
35
For example, 
during the low mortgage rate 
environment in 2020, overall low- 
income refinance volume in the market 
increased significantly, exceeding 1.3 
million loans.
36
However, the total 
market volume for all refinances also 
surged, reaching over 6.3 million 
loans.
37
This resulted in a low-income 
refinance market performance of only 
21.0 percent. During that time period, as 
well as during 2015 to 2017, neither the 
Enterprises nor the market was able to 
perform above the 26.0 percent 
proposed target. 
Conversely, in 2023, amidst higher 
mortgage rates, the overall low-income 
refinance volume contracted sharply to 
approximately 160,000 loans, while 
total market refinance volume declined 
to about 397,000 loans.
38
This 
contraction in volume corresponded to 
a substantially higher low-income 
refinance market performance of 40.3 
percent. The Enterprises’ performance 
on the low-income refinance goal 
mirrored this pattern, with their low- 
income refinance percentages increasing 
significantly during this later period, 
even as the absolute volume of their 
low-income refinance mortgage 
purchases decreased. 
Moreover, since the publication of the 
proposed rule, FHFA has observed 
declines in the 30-year mortgage rate in 
September and October. These rates 
correspond to expected increases in 
refinances for primary residences 
compared to the rest of 2025. With this 
surge in refinance activity, the Agency 
has already observed a decline in the 
rate of low-income refinance mortgages 
below the proposed benchmark. This 
performance is consistent with our 
expectations based on historical market 
performance. 
Although mortgage rates are expected 
to decline during the 2026–2028 
housing goals period, FHFA’s model 
cannot forecast the low-income 
refinance market with a high degree of 
confidence due to the unpredictability 
of future interest rates and the strong 
sensitivity of refinance originations to 
interest rates. FHFA initially proposed 
to maintain the benchmark level at 26.0 
percent, which is below the lower 
bound of the confidence interval in the 
market forecast used in the 2025–2027 
final rule, to account for this 
uncertainty. Additionally, FHFA 
included the measurement buffer in the 
2025–2027 final rule to enable the 
Enterprises to focus on meeting the 
market if mortgage rates decline more 
significantly than expected. Without a 
measurement buffer, FHFA believes that 
a 26.0 percent benchmark level may not 
be achievable if mortgage rates decline 
and the Enterprises need to focus on the 
market level to meet the goal.

As shown in Table 4, both Enterprises 
performed well above the 26.0 percent 
benchmark level in 2022–2024, when 
mortgage rates were high, and FHFA 
does not expect Enterprise performance 
to decline significantly due to a lowered 
benchmark level if mortgage rates 
remain elevated.
39
Considering that the 
Enterprises have performed well above 
the benchmark level in the current high- 
interest rate environment, FHFA 
believes the 21.0 percent benchmark 
level in the final rule is reasonable and 
will enable the Enterprises to remain 
focused on both affordability and safety 
and soundness, even if mortgage rates 
decline significantly. Additionally, 
FHFA believes that setting the 
benchmark level where the market 
performed when mortgage rates were 
low eliminates the need for a 
measurement buffer for this goal. 
In response to comments and after 
reassessing the historical performance 
and market trends, FHFA has 
determined that a benchmark level 
lower than 26.0 percent for the low- 
income refinance goal is appropriate. 
The Agency believes that this decision 
is responsive to concerns expressed by 
commenters in this rule and in response 
to the 2025–2027 proposed housing 
goals rule, and that a lower benchmark 
goal will be a more reasonable and 
achievable, yet still difficult, target if 
interest rates decline significantly. 
Therefore, in this final rule FHFA is 
setting the benchmark level for the low- 
income refinance goal at 21.0 percent,

which was the market performance 
during the 2020 refinance boom when 
mortgage rates were low. 
V. Multifamily Housing Goals and 
Subgoal 
A. Factors Considered in Setting the 
Multifamily Housing Goal Benchmark 
Levels 
The Safety and Soundness Act 
requires FHFA to consider the following 
six factors in setting the multifamily 
housing goals: 
1. National multifamily mortgage 
credit needs and the ability of the 
Enterprises to provide additional 
liquidity and stability for the 
multifamily mortgage market; 
2. The performance and effort of the 
Enterprises in making mortgage credit 
available for multifamily housing in 
previous years; 
3. The size of the multifamily 
mortgage market for housing affordable 
to low-income and very low-income 
families, including the size of the 
multifamily markets for housing of a 
smaller or limited size; 
4. The ability of the Enterprises to 
lead the market in making multifamily 
mortgage credit available, especially for 
multifamily housing affordable to low- 
income and very low-income families; 
5. The availability of public subsidies; 
and 
6. The need to maintain the sound 
financial condition of the Enterprises.
40
 
FHFA has considered each of these 
six statutory factors in setting the 
benchmark levels for each of the 
multifamily housing goals in this final 
rule. 
B. Multifamily Housing Goals 
Comments and FHFA Determinations 
FHFA received comments on the 
multifamily housing goals 
recommendations from seven 
commenters, including trade 
associations, nonprofit organizations, 
and letters signed by multiple 
organizations. Nearly all of the 
commenters that provided feedback on 
the proposed multifamily housing goals 
benchmark levels supported the 
proposal to maintain the current 
multifamily low-income goal 
benchmark at 61.0 percent, maintain the 
current very low-income goal 
benchmark at 14.0 percent, and 
maintain the current small multifamily 
low-income subgoal benchmark at 2.0 
percent. One trade association stated 
that the proposed housing goals 
appropriately reflect past performance 
of the Enterprises and maintain their 
focus on serving the low- and very low- 
income renter community. Another 
trade association stated that the 
proposed benchmarks strike an 
appropriate balance, ensuring the 
Enterprises fulfill their mission to 
promote affordability while continuing 
to provide liquidity across the broader 
multifamily market. These two trade 
associations strongly supported the 
proposal to maintain the small 
multifamily low-income subgoal at 2.0 
percent, noting that this segment 
already benefits from robust private 
capital participation. Regarding the 
proposed very low-income goal, one 
trade association expressed support for 
the 14.0 percent benchmark given the 
past performance of the Enterprises and 
the critical need for housing for this 
income cohort. 
Of the remaining commenters on the 
multifamily housing goals, one trade 
association suggested increasing the 
low-income goal due to the Enterprises’ 
track record of exceeding the 61 percent 
benchmark and ongoing national 
shortages of affordable rental housing 
for low-income households. The group 
noted that the need for affordable rental 
housing is well-documented and 
growing. Another trade association 
stated that the low-income goal should 
only be increased if the single-family 
housing goals are similarly increased, so 
as not to create an imbalance between 
rental and homeownership 
opportunities. 
All the comments on the proposed 
multifamily housing goal benchmark 
levels emphasized the importance of the 
role of the multifamily housing goals in 
the affordable rental housing finance 
market. One letter submitted on behalf 
of 28 organizations stated that the 
multifamily housing goals are important 
in addressing the affordable rental 
housing crisis. Another letter submitted 
on behalf of 17 organizations noted that 
the Enterprises back more than 40 
percent of multifamily mortgage debt, 
giving them a critical role in supporting 
affordable rental housing. 
Additionally, a trade association 
recommended that FHFA help the 
Enterprises balance their multifamily 
housing goals with providing liquidity 
support for market-rate units. The 
Agency agrees that the Enterprises 
should support both affordable and 
market-rate units. FHFA considers 
market-rate units when setting the cap 
on multifamily purchase volume (the 
Multifamily Volume Cap) and the 
percent of loans purchased that must be 
‘‘mission-driven’’ affordable housing.
41
 
The Enterprise housing goals, however, 
are focused on families at or below 
specific AMI levels. 
The recent performance of the

changed from the number of low- 
income units to the share of low-income 
units.

Table 7 shows Enterprise performance 
on this subgoal, including the previous 
numeric benchmark levels applicable 
through 2022 and the percentage-based 
metric that began in 2023. FHFA 
recognizes that the Enterprises have 
different business approaches to the 
small multifamily market segment, and 
that each Enterprise sets its own credit 
risk tolerance for these products. As a 
result, each Enterprise has performed 
very differently on this subgoal. Since 
2021, Freddie Mac has exceeded Fannie 
Mae in terms of percentage share of total 
units and volume of low-income units 
in small (5–50) multifamily properties. 
Based on the comments received and 
FHFA’s consideration of the statutory 
factors, including the recent 
performance of the Enterprises and the 
market forecasts shown in the tables 
above, FHFA has determined that the 
benchmark levels for each of the 
multifamily housing goals and subgoal 
should be established at the levels 
proposed. FHFA believes that this 
approach will appropriately balance the 
objectives of the housing goals and the 
Multifamily Volume Cap. FHFA also 
agrees with commenters that 
maintaining the three multifamily goals 
at current levels is appropriate and 
believes that the benchmark levels 
support affordable housing. 
C. Simplify Enterprise Multifamily Goals 
and Targets 
One trade association encouraged 
FHFA to work towards harmonizing the 
multifamily affordable and mission- 
related goals of the Enterprises 
(including the housing goals that are the 
subject of this final rule and the annual 
‘‘mission-driven’’ requirements 
associated with the Multifamily Volume 
Cap). According to the trade association, 
the Enterprises’ multifamily businesses 
operate to meet two affordable housing 
targets every year, one based on unit

count and the other based on a dollar 
volume limit with required minimum 
percentages. The commenter stated that 
this is a confusing process whereby each 
Enterprise must meet two different 
affordability frameworks. 
FHFA has already taken measures to 
assist the Enterprises in coordinating 
their efforts with respect to these 
requirements. Both of these 
requirements help ensure that the 
Enterprises fulfill a different aspect of 
their statutory mission and charters, and 
each requirement serves low- and 
moderate-income families and 
underserved markets in different ways. 
For example, FHFA’s 2023–2024 
Multifamily Enterprise Housing Goals 
final rule established the benchmark 
levels for the multifamily housing goals 
based on a different methodology—the 
percentage of affordable units in 
multifamily properties financed by 
mortgages purchased by the Enterprise 
each year. FHFA believes this change 
simplifies the multifamily housing goals 
in a way that complements the 
Multifamily Volume Cap and enables 
the Enterprises to meet both targets 
more seamlessly. FHFA will continue to 
explore ways to coordinate and 
streamline the requirements of the 
various multifamily affordable and 
mission-related goals of the Enterprises 
while ensuring these goals are achieved. 
VI. Other Issues 
A. 12866 Regulatory Impact & Single- 
Family Market Forecast 
Recommendations 
Five commenters responded to 
FHFA’s regulatory impact analysis and 
12866 significance determination. 
Overall, commenters expressed concern 
about evidence provided in FHFA’s 
regulatory impact analysis. Advocacy 
groups opposed FHFA’s estimated 
decrease in goal-qualified loans under 
the proposed rule, stating that the 
estimate is inaccurate and should 
incorporate the assumption that lenders 
will stop making loans to low-income 
borrowers if the housing goals were 
lowered. Additionally, nonprofit policy 
advocacy groups and trade associations 
asserted the regulatory impact analysis 
included insufficient data and over- 
relied on anecdotal evidence. For 
example, groups argued that several 
arguments lacked credible evidence, 
including claims by FHFA in the 
proposed rule that FHA, VA, and USDA 
loans may better meet borrowers’ needs 
than Enterprise loans, and that the 
Enterprises have been turning away 
middle-class borrowers to meet housing 
goals. 
One commenter, representing 28 
national and state advocacy groups, 
believed FHFA included contradictory 
reasoning within the regulatory impact 
analysis. Specifically, the commenter 
noted, FHFA states that the Enterprises’ 
acquisition of goal loans under the 
proposed rule will not change from 
current levels, yet also acknowledges a 
factor that could dissuade the 
Enterprises from acquiring the same 
volume of goal loans: the lower returns 
the Enterprises receive on housing-goal- 
qualifying loans. Other commenters 
urged FHFA to conduct further data- 
driven analysis of the proposed rule’s 
impact to housing goal acquisitions. 
Advocacy groups also urged FHFA to 
study the effectiveness of housing goals 
in accomplishing statutory intent and 
provide empirical evidence to support 
FHFA’s anecdotal claims before making 
further regulatory decisions. Some 
individual commenters suggested FHFA 
evaluate the effectiveness of the 
proposed rule post-implementation to 
learn and adjust for future rulemakings. 
State and national policy advocacy 
groups also raised a series of data 
concerns with the market forecast model 
for single-family goals. First, groups 
recommended that FHFA avoid setting 
the benchmarks below historic and 
expected mortgage market level without 
sufficient evidence and model data to 
support the decisioning. Additional 
market forecast-related concerns include 
claims that the rule relies on the same 
data and market forecast used in the 
2025–2027 rule, which set higher single- 
family benchmarks, but now reaches the 
opposite conclusion by lowering 
benchmarks. Individual commenters, 
advocacy groups, and trade associations 
urged FHFA to maintain a data-driven 
approach to setting the benchmarks, 
respecting the data integrity and 
analytical rigor in goal setting. 
Responding to the first concern raised 
by advocacy groups that FHFA’s 
regulatory impact analysis shows an 
inaccurate decrease in the number of 
loans to low-to moderate-income 
households over the next three years, 
FHFA considered impacts to loan 
deliveries across likely and unlikely 
scenarios. In accordance with OMB’s 
Circular No. A–4, Executive Order 
12866, 44 U.S.C. 3501–3521, and 31 
U.S.C. 1105, FHFA provided an estimate 
of impact under a range of scenarios, to 
account for unforeseen factors including 
market uncertainty. While FHFA 
acknowledges stakeholder concerns 
regarding the estimated likely and 
unlikely impact as identified in the 
regulatory impact analysis, the Agency 
provided this analysis using the most up 
to date and accurate data available. 
Addressing the concern that lenders 
may not make loans to low- to 
moderate-income households without 
Enterprise backing, FHFA anticipates no 
reduction in Enterprise support for such 
loans and, as such, no adverse changes 
in lender activity. As articulated in the 
preamble to the proposed rule, both 
Enterprises have a statutory mandate to 
provide these loans, regardless of 
established benchmark levels.
45
Further, 
lenders have an economic incentive to 
purchase these loans due to pricing 
benefits, and these loans are profitable 
for the Enterprises to purchase.
46
Lastly, 
historical performance data 
demonstrates that the Enterprises are 
likely to deliver above the benchmark 
number, and more similar to the 
market.
47
Therefore, FHFA believes that 
the current benchmark levels will not 
lead to a reduction in support and 
instead will best promote 
homeownership. 
FHFA acknowledges that certain 
statements in the proposed rule, when 
taken in isolation can be perceived as 
‘‘contradictory.’’ However, FHFA finds 
it inappropriate to isolate these 
statements and not consider the full 
arguments articulated. For example, 
given the argument that FHFA makes 
contradictory statements about whether 
the Enterprises will purchase loans to 
low-income borrowers, the fact that goal 
qualifying loans can be less profitable 
for the Enterprises should not lead to 
the conclusion that the Enterprises will 
stop providing liquidity. Lenders and 
the Enterprises have clear statutory 
obligations and economic incentives to 
deliver loans to low- and moderate- 
income borrowers, such as spec pool 
trading pay-ups.
48
Addressing the 
concern about the lack of sufficient data 
on the benefit of the VA/RHS and FHA 
for low-income borrowers in 
comparison to Enterprise loans, FHFA 
provided a summary of how many low- 
income borrowers were served by VA/ 
RHS and FHA loans in 2024 in the 
preamble to the proposed rule.
49
This 
evidence makes clear that non- 
Enterprise players have a valuable stake 
in serving low to moderate income 
borrowers. Concerning sentiments that 
FHA mortgages are not cheaper 
alternatives than Enterprise loans, 
FHFA does not agree that FHA loans are 
always a more expensive or less

attractive alternative. Borrower costs 
and loan decisions depend on multiple 
factors that include credit risk, loan 
structure, expected tenure, down 
payment or closing cost constraints, and 
prevailing market conditions. For some 
borrowers, FHA products may be more 
attractive due to lower upfront cash 
requirements, underwriting flexibility, 
or other alignments with their financial 
circumstances. However, FHFA does 
acknowledge that there may be, on-net, 
increased costs for the group of 
borrowers shifting from Enterprise- 
backed mortgages to non-conventional 
mortgages as a result of this rule. FHA 
loans play a critical role in expanding 
access to mortgage credit and, along 
with VA/RHS, operate as part of a 
diverse system of federal housing 
finance programs rather than one with 
direct competitors or substitutes for 
Enterprise-backed products. 
FHFA considered commenters’ 
concerns about reliance on anecdotal 
evidence within 12866. FHFA 
acknowledges that empirical evidence 
provides a scientific basis for decision- 
making. However, the Agency notes that 
qualitative and anecdotal evidence can 
be an important source of decisioning, 
especially with limited data available on 
a problem.
50
FHFA intends to use its 
observations of how aggressively high 
housing goals lead to market distortions, 
crowding-out effects, and 
‘‘denominator-management,’’ to spark 
further investigation and empirical 
research into these claims, although it is 
not prepared to commit to publishing 
any specific research or review at this 
time. Further, as noted above, FHFA’s 
regulatory impact analysis did provide 
empirical evidence for the denominator 
management effect based on all 
available agency data which includes 
entire portfolio information from both 
Enterprises as well as a nationally 
representative sample of all residential 
mortgages in the United States.
51
This 
indicates that, on the margins, lenders 
may be turning away middle-class 
borrowers. Performance under the 
proposed benchmarks will provide 
FHFA with the additional empirical 
data necessary to further study the 
impact of the lowered benchmarks and 
gain more insight into the nature of our 
preliminary observations. Since 2013, 
FHFA has consistently increased the 
benchmarks for most single-family 
goals,
52
yet housing affordability 
continues to be a challenge for 
Americans. The Agency believes that 
this alternative approach may best meet 
the Agency’s policy goals to ensure a 
liquid housing market for all Americans, 
while continuing to support lower- 
income families. 
FHFA’s decisioning behind setting the 
benchmarks below the historical and 
expected market delivery is aimed at 
addressing current market uncertainty 
with predictions. By setting most 
benchmarks at the low end of the model 
confidence interval, or just below the 
model estimates, FHFA provides 
flexibility for the Enterprises while still 
holding them to statutory obligations. 
FHFA considered the seven statutory 
factors in establishing the benchmarks, 
including the market forecast. However, 
FHFA weighed the evidence of the past 
performance of the Enterprises in 
achieving the benchmarks and the 
ability of the Enterprises to lead the 
industry, more heavily in its decisioning 
given Agency priorities. Instead of 
relying primarily on the uncertain 
single-family market forecast model, as 
in previous rulemakings, FHFA 
considered the model as one of many 
factors considered when setting the final 
benchmark levels. It is important to note 
that the Agency has never relied solely 
on the model output to set goals, and 
has set the housing goal benchmarks in 
the context of all the statutory factors. 
Therefore, FHFA finds the benchmarks 
appropriately balance flexibility and 
market forecast data to set the 
benchmarks at the proposed level. 
B. Regulatory Capacity & Accountability 
Mechanisms 
The agency received comments on 
how the proposed rule impacts 
regulatory capacity and function. 
Individual commenters and trade 
associations commended FHFA for its 
efforts to reduce regulatory burden, 
streamline processes, and enhance 
operational efficiency. They argued that 
the lower benchmarks appropriately 
balance statutory obligations with the 
need for greater efficiency in loan 
pricing and the minimization of 
duplication across the secondary 
mortgage market. Trade associations 
also praised FHFA’s holistic approach 
in the proposed rule, highlighting the 
importance of ensuring optimal loan 
execution for borrowers in the market. 
In contrast, advocacy groups contended 
that there is insufficient evidence to 
demonstrate that the proposed changes 
will meaningfully improve operational 
efficiency or reduce regulatory burden 
for FHFA, the Enterprises, or the 
broader housing market. 
National, state, and local advocacy 
groups emphasized that housing goals 
are a critical accountability mechanism 
for FHFA to ensure the Enterprises serve 
low- to moderate-income borrowers. 
These groups argued that the proposed 
single-family benchmarks weaken 
FHFA’s regulatory authority and 
asserted that this accountability 
mechanism should be strengthened, not 
diminished, given current affordability 
challenges. Nonprofits and advocacy 
organizations also encouraged FHFA to 
take a more active role in adjusting 
policy in real time to reflect public 
needs and current housing conditions. 
FHFA finds that the proposed rule 
will reduce regulatory burden. The 
Enterprises are likely to save on 
expenses associated with meeting and 
monitoring housing goals and 
responding to regulatory requests under 
a housing plan, as the lower 
benchmarks are more achievable given 
current and projected market 
conditions. By removing the complexity 
of multiple low-income area subgoals, 
the proposed rule provides the 
Enterprises with a clearer framework for 
underwriting, investment, pricing, and 
reporting. Evidence of the rule’s 
potential to improve operational 
efficiency is presented in FHFA’s 
regulatory impact analysis, which 
shows that the Enterprises are expected 
to issue approximately $72 billion in 
additional goal-eligible financing over 
2026–2028 without incurring any 
expenses beyond those already 
anticipated under the 2025–2027 
housing goal benchmark levels.
53
 
The Agency agrees that the housing 
goals are a critical accountability 
mechanism to ensure the Enterprises 
serve low- to moderate-income 
borrowers. However, FHFA disagrees 
with commenters who suggested that 
lower benchmarks would diminish the 
Agency’s ability to hold the Enterprises 
accountable for fulfilling statutory 
mandates. While FHFA acknowledges 
that the proposed single-family

benchmarks are lower than recent 
single-family benchmarks, the rule 
maintains existing enforcement 
mechanisms to ensure that the 
Enterprises continue to support low- to 
moderate-income borrowers.
54
These 
mechanisms include civil money 
penalties, housing plans, final and 
preliminary determinations of 
compliance, ongoing monitoring of the 
Enterprises, and annual reporting 
requirements. FHFA, as conservator, 
also has additional tools to ensure the 
Enterprises are supporting liquidity for 
low- to moderate-income families and it 
is FHFA’s intention that the housing 
goal benchmarks do not represent a cap 
on loan purchases. 
FHFA also agrees with commenters 
that FHFA should adjust policy in real 
time to reflect public needs and current 
housing conditions. FHFA is committed 
to actively evaluating policy and the 
benchmarks to reflect public needs and 
current housing conditions, as 
demonstrated by the decision to issue 
the proposed rule. The Agency plans to 
assess the impact of the proposed 
single-family benchmarks on borrowers 
and will adjust future policy decisions 
accordingly. FHFA will also assess 
whether more frequent rulemakings for 
housing goals benchmark setting would 
be appropriate and better reflect 
changing market conditions and 
respond to market uncertainty. 
C. Measurement Buffer 
Recommendations 
The Agency received comments 
regarding the application of 
measurement buffers and the setting of 
benchmarks within the housing goals 
framework. An industry trade group 
strongly urged the retention of 
measurement buffers, arguing that they 
are essential to mitigate market 
distortions and the challenges posed by 
using lagged, potentially year-old data 
to set static goals. The group noted the 
housing industry’s sensitivity to rapid 
shifts in interest rates, volumes, and 
macroeconomic conditions, asserting 
that buffers help ensure goal compliance 
when goal levels and actual market 
production are misaligned, specifically 
suggesting the benefit for the single- 
family low-income refinance goal. 
Similarly, an advocacy coalition voiced 
concern over removal of the 
measurement buffers and factored 
increasing the benchmark and 
maintaining the buffers to ensure lower- 
income borrowers have reduced access 
to liquidity. The coalition believed that 
lowering the benchmark could permit 
the Enterprises to allocate a significantly 
smaller share of activity to goals-eligible 
loans than the market overall. 
The Agency agrees that misalignment 
between the goal levels and actual 
market production may result in 
unintended consequences, particularly 
for the low-income refinance goal due to 
its heightened sensitivity to outside 
changes. Based on commenters’ 
feedback, as discussed above, FHFA has 
adjusted the low-income refinance goal 
to the same level that was in place in 
prior periods of low-interest rates. 
Additionally, the Enterprises may be in 
compliance with housing goals if they 
meet the market, which is determined 
retrospectively, is not static, and 
accurately represents overall market 
performance. FHFA believes that having 
a market-level compliance standard and 
implementing the revised benchmark 
will mitigate any unintended market 
distortions. FHFA disagrees that the 
benchmarks will result in the 
Enterprises purchasing a smaller share 
of goal qualifying loans. Based on 
historical data, and, as discussed in the 
preamble to the proposed rule and 
above, the Enterprises have performed 
above benchmarks and have incentives 
to continue to purchase loans made to 
low-income borrowers. 
D. Notice of Determination of 
Compliance With Housing Goals 
The current housing goals regulation 
requires FHFA to provide each 
Enterprise with a preliminary 
determination of the Enterprise’s 
performance each year, whether the 
Enterprise has met its housing goals or 
not. The proposed rule sought to 
simplify FHFA’s process for issuing 
preliminary and final determination 
letters by eliminating the requirement 
for FHFA to issue a preliminary 
determination letter if an Enterprise has 
met all of the housing goals for that 
year. As revised, FHFA would be 
required to provide a preliminary 
determination to an Enterprise only if 
the Enterprise failed to meet one or 
more of its housing goals for the year. 
FHFA did not receive any substantive 
comments on the proposed revision to 
the process for issuing preliminary and 
final determination letters. If an 
Enterprise has met the housing goals, it 
is not necessary for the Enterprise to 
provide additional information in order 
for FHFA to reach a final determination. 
Issuing a preliminary determination 
letter in that situation creates 
unnecessary paperwork, without a 
corresponding procedural benefit. The 
final rule therefore revises section 
1282.20(b) so that a preliminary 
determination letter is required only if 
an Enterprise has failed, or that there is 
a substantial probability that an 
Enterprise will fail, to meet any housing 
goal or subgoal. 
E. Technical Changes 
The proposed rule included several 
technical changes to conform the 
language used in the regulation with 
FHFA’s current processes and with 
commonly-used terminology. FHFA did 
not receive any substantive comments 
on the proposed technical changes. For 
the reasons stated in the preamble to the 
proposed rule and summarized below, 
the final rule adopts each of the 
proposed technical changes. 
FHFA often uses the terms ‘‘low- 
income home purchase goal’’ and ‘‘very 
low-income home purchase goal’’ to 
refer to the low-income families housing 
goal and the very low-income families 
housing goal, respectively, described in 
12 CFR 1282.12(c) and (d). Similarly, 
FHFA uses the term ‘‘low-income areas 
home purchase goal’’ to refer to the low- 
income areas housing goal described in 
12 CFR 1282.12(e). FHFA typically 
refers to the refinancing housing goal in 
12 CFR 1282.12(h) as the ‘‘low-income 
refinance goal.’’ The final rule adopts 
each of these changes to the names of 
the various housing goals in the relevant 
paragraphs. 
The final rule also revises section 
1282.12(e) to specify that FHFA will 
publish the annual notice establishing 
the benchmark level for the low-income 
areas home purchase goal on FHFA’s 
website. This change is consistent with 
FHFA’s current practice for notices and 
determinations related to the Enterprise 
housing goals. 
Finally, the final rule updates how the 
benchmark levels are expressed in the 
regulation. The current regulation does 
not include any decimals in the 
benchmark levels. For example, the 
benchmark for the low-income families 
home purchase goal is expressed as ‘‘25 
percent’’ rather than ‘‘25.0 percent.’’ 
FHFA has an established practice has 
been to determine Enterprise 
performance on the housing goals at the 
first decimal. Updating the numeric 
expression of the benchmark levels in 
the regulation is a technical, non- 
substantive change that better aligns the 
rule language with existing practice, and 
reduces the possibility of confusion. 
The final rule therefore updates the 
numeric expression of each benchmark 
level to include the first digit after the 
decimal for each of the single-family 
and multifamily benchmark levels.

F. Required Adjustments To Maximum 
Civil Money Penalty Amounts 
The Safety and Soundness Act 
authorizes FHFA to seek civil money 
penalties to enforce several 
requirements related to the Enterprise 
and Bank housing goals. These civil 
money penalties are subject to the 
Federal Civil Penalties Inflation 
Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 
2015 (Adjustment Improvements Act), 
which amended the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 
1990 by establishing a mechanism for 
regular adjustment for inflation of civil 
money penalties.
55
 
The proposed rule would have made 
explicit the mandatory inflation 
adjustments required by law. Additional 
detail on the calculation method used 
by FHFA to determine the new 
maximum civil money penalty amounts. 
FHFA did not receive any substantive 
comments on the proposed changes 
related to the maximum amounts for 
any civil money penalties that may be 
assessed in connection with the Bank or 
Enterprise housing goals. The final rule 
adopts the changes to the relevant 
sections as proposed. The new 
maximum civil money penalty amounts 
are set out in this table, summarizing 
the changes made by this final rule: 
U.S. Code citation Description Adjusted 
maximum 
penalty 
amount 
12 U.S.C. 4585(b)(1) ...... Maximum penalty for failure described in 1345(a)(1), for each day that the failure occurs .................. 145,754 12 U.S.C. 4585(b)(2) ...... Maximum penalty for failure described in 1345(a)(2), (3), or (4), for each day that the failure occurs 72,876 These new maximum civil money 
penalty amounts will apply 
prospectively to any civil money 
penalty action initiated in connection 
with the Bank or Enterprise housing 
goals after the effective date of this final 
rule. The final rule revises sections 
1209.1(c)(4), 1209.80, 1209.81, 
1281.15(f), and 1282.22 to make clear 
that the new maximum penalty amounts 
above apply to any civil money 
penalties in connection with the 
Enterprise or Bank housing goals. 
VII. Considerations of Differences 
Between the Banks and the Enterprises 
When promulgating regulations 
relating to the Banks, section 1313(f) of 
the Safety and Soundness Act requires 
the Director of FHFA to consider the 
differences between the Banks and the 
Enterprises with respect to the Banks’ 
cooperative ownership structure; 
mission of providing liquidity to 
members; affordable housing and 
community development mission; 
capital structure; and joint and several 
liability. FHFA, in preparing this final 
rule, considered the differences between 
the Banks and the Enterprises as they 
relate to the above factors. FHFA also 
considered these differences in light of 
section 10C of the Bank Act, which 
requires that the Bank housing goals be 
consistent with the Enterprise housing 
goals, with consideration of the unique 
mission and ownership structure of the 
Banks. 
VIII. Regulatory Impact 
A. Paperwork Reduction Act 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (PRA), the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) must 
‘‘review and approve proposed agency 
collections of information.’’ See 44 U.S.C. 3504(c)(1). OMB has determined 
that the Enterprise reporting 
requirements in Subpart D of Part 1282 
constitute a ‘‘collection of information’’ 
for purposes of the PRA. FHFA has 
submitted a request for emergency 
authorization for the information 
collection pursuant to 5 CFR 1320.13, 
and OMB has approved the request. 
FHFA may publish additional notice via 
a separate Federal Register notice 
following the issuance of this final rule. 
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires that a 
regulation that has a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities, small 
businesses, or small organizations must 
include an initial regulatory flexibility 
analysis describing the regulation’s 
impact on small entities. Such an 
analysis need not be undertaken if the 
agency has certified that the regulation 
will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. 5 U.S.C. 605(b). FHFA has 
considered the impact of the final rule 
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
FHFA certifies that the final rule will 
not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities 
because the rule applies to Fannie Mae, 
Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home 
Loan Banks, which are not small entities 
for purposes of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. 
C. Congressional Review Act and 
Executive Order 12866, Regulatory 
Planning and Review 
The Office of Management and 
Budget, Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has 
determined the final rule meets the 
definition of ‘‘major rule’’ in the 
Congressional Review Act at 5 U.S.C. 
804(2). OIRA also has determined that 
this rule is economically significant 
under subsection 3(f)(1) of Executive 
Order 12866. FHFA submitted a 
regulatory impact analysis to OIRA, 
which reviewed the potential costs and 
benefits of the final rule. The analysis is 
available on FHFA’s rulemaking website 
https://www.fhfa.gov/regulation/ 
rulemaking and is part of the docket file for this final rule. 
D. Executive Order 13563: Improving 
Regulation and Regulatory Review 
Executive Order 13563 directs 
agencies to analyze regulations that are 
‘‘outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or 
excessively burdensome, and to modify, 
streamline, expand, or repeal them in 
accordance with what has been 
learned.’’ Executive Order 13563 also 
directs that, where relevant, feasible, 
and consistent with regulatory 
objectives, and to the extent permitted 
by law, agencies are to identify and 
consider regulatory approaches that 
reduce burdens and maintain flexibility 
and freedom of choice for the public. 
FHFA has developed this final rule in 
a manner consistent with these 
requirements. 
E. Executive Order 14192: Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation 
Executive Order 14192 requires that 
for each new regulation issued, at least 
10 existing regulations be identified for 
elimination. Executive Order 14192 also 
directs that any new incremental costs 
associated with new regulations shall, to 
the extent permitted by law, be offset by

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59965 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations the elimination of existing costs 
associated with at least 10 prior 
regulations. FHFA’s implementation of 
these requirements will be informed by 
M–25–20, Guidance Implementing 
Section 3 of Executive Order 14192, 
Titled ‘‘Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation’’ (March 26, 2025). This 
final rule is expected to be an Executive 
Order 14192 deregulatory action 
although the cost savings are 
unquantified. 
IX. Severability 
The final rule makes explicit FHFA’s 
intent that all provisions of the 
Enterprise housing goals regulation be 
severable by adding a severability 
clause, as new 12 CFR 1282.11(c). The 
regulation contains many thematically 
related but ultimately independent 
regulatory requirements, each of which 
can function independently. For 
example, FHFA establishes each goal 
and subgoal independently from one 
another, utilizing separate formulas and 
consideration of differing statutory 
factors. If one goal or subgoal is found 
to be invalid or unenforceable for any 
reason, it is FHFA’s intention that the 
remaining goals continue in effect. 
Adding a severability clause to the 
regulation ensures that each of the 
distinct policy objectives in the 
regulation will be realized to the 
greatest extent possible.

(a) Preliminary determination. On an annual basis, the Director will evaluate 
each Enterprise’s performance under 
each single-family housing goal and 
subgoal and each multifamily housing 
goal and subgoal. 
(b) Notice of preliminary determination. If the Director preliminarily determines that an 
Enterprise has failed, or that there is a 
substantial probability that an 
Enterprise will fail, to meet any housing 
goal or subgoal, the Director will 
provide written notice to the Enterprise 
of the preliminary determination of its 
performance under each housing goal 
and subgoal established by this subpart, 
before public disclosure of the 
preliminary determination. The written 
notice will include the reasons for such 
determination, and the information on 
which the Director based the 
determination. 
(c) Response by Enterprise. Any notification to an Enterprise of a 
preliminary determination under this 
section will provide the Enterprise with 
an opportunity to respond in writing in 
accordance with the procedures at 12 
U.S.C. 4566(b)(1) and (2). Relevant 
information in a timely written response 
from an Enterprise will be included in

(a) Determination. On an annual basis, the Director will make a final 
determination of each Enterprise’s 
performance under each single-family 
housing goal and subgoal and each 
multifamily housing goal and subgoal. 
The determination will address whether 
an Enterprise has failed, or there is a 
substantial probability that an 
Enterprise will fail, to meet any housing 
goal or subgoal and whether the 
achievement of that housing goal or 
subgoal was or is feasible. 
(b) Notice of determination. The Director will provide each Enterprise 
with written notification of the 
determination in accordance with the 
procedures at 12 U.S.C. 4562(f) and 12 
U.S.C. 4566(b)(3). If the Enterprise has 
met each of the housing goals and 
subgoals, the notification will provide 
the Enterprise with an opportunity to 
comment on the determination during 
the 30-day period beginning upon 
receipt of the notification by the 
Enterprise. If the Enterprise has failed, 
or there is a substantial probability that 
an Enterprise will fail, to meet any 
housing goal or subgoal that FHFA 
determines was or is feasible, the 
notification will specify whether the 
Enterprise is required to submit a 
housing plan for approval under 
§ 1282.22.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Authority for This Rulemaking 
The FAA’s authority to issue rules 
regarding aviation safety is found in 
Title 49 of the United States Code. 
Subtitle I, Section 106 describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. 
Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the 
agency’s authority. This rulemaking is 
promulgated under the authority 
described in Subtitle VII, Part A, 
Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that 
section, the FAA is charged with 
prescribing regulations to assign the use 
of the airspace necessary to ensure the 
safety of aircraft and the efficient use of 
airspace. This regulation is within the 
scope of that authority as it modifies the 
National Airspace System as necessary 
to preserve the safe and efficient flow of 
air traffic. 
History 
The FAA published an NPRM for 
Docket No. FAA–2025–0141 in the 
Federal Register (90 FR 25173; June 16, 
2025), proposing to amend VOR Federal 
Airway V–300 due to the planned 
relocation of the Wiarton, ON, Canada, 
VOR/DME NAVAID. Interested parties 
were invited to participate in this 
rulemaking effort by submitting written 
comments on the proposal. One 
comment was received. 
The commenter suggested the FAA 
validate the 25–AGL–5 Airspace Docket 
Number used in the NPRM to ensure it 
was correct. The commenter also 
suggested validating the distance of the 
Wiarton, ON, Canada, VOR/DME 
relocation that was published in the 
NPRM. Additionally, the commenter 
offered that the magnetic radial (called 
bearings in the comment) values listed 
to describe the RIBIR, IILND, and 
MRUCI fixes in the V–300 description 
in the NPRM were incorrect and should 
have been lower than the companion 
true radials they were listed with 
instead of being larger. Finally, the 
commenter stated the CFNKB computer 
navigation fix (CNF) on the United 
States (U.S.)/Canada border that was 
listed in the NPRM should have been 
spelled CYNKB as contained in FAA 
Order JO 7400.11 and on the Detroit 
sectional. 
The FAA reviewed each of the items 
raised by the commenter and offers the 
following in response. The 25–AGL–5 
Airspace Docket Number was assigned 
by the Central Service Center, 
Operations Support Group in 
accordance with FAA Order JO 7400.2 
and was determined to be correct as 
published in the NPRM. 
With respect to the distance the 
Wiarton, ON, Canada, VOR was 
relocated, the FAA received the 
geographic latitude and longitude 
coordinates from NAV CANADA for the 
original and new locations of the VOR. 
Upon review, the distance of the VOR 
relocation was calculated to be just over 
135 feet West-Southwest from the 
original location instead of 
approximately 80 feet West of the 
original location as specified in the 
NPRM. That information has been 
updated. 
In determining the true and magnetic 
radials for the RIBIR, IILND, and MRUCI 
fixes in the V–300 description, the FAA 
used the most recent magnetic variation 
values associated with the Sault Ste 
Marie, MI, VOR/DME and the Pellston, 
MI, VOR/Tactical Air Navigation 
(VORTAC) NAVAIDs. The magnetic 
variation for the Sault Ste Marie VOR/ 
DME is 4° West and for the Pellston VORTAC is 6° West. When calculating magnetic radials using counterpart true 
radials, West magnetic variation values 
are added to the true radial value; 
whereas East magnetic variation values 
are subtracted from the true radial 
value. The true and magnetic radials 
listed for the RIBIR, IILND, and MRUCI 
fixes in the V–300 description in the 
NPRM were correct as published. 
However, for awareness, the FAA only 
publishes true radial values in final 
rules. 
Lastly, the FAA verified that the 
CFNKB CNF located on the U.S./Canada 
border was spelled correctly in the 
NPRM and matches the CNF 
information currently contained in the 
FAA’s National Airspace System 
Resource database and as published on 
the IFR Enroute Low Altitude L–31 
chart. CNFs are not published in FAA 
Order JO 7400.11 or on sectional charts. 
Incorporation by Reference 
VOR Federal Airways are published 
in paragraph 6010(a) of FAA Order JO 
7400.11, Airspace Designations and 
Reporting Points, which is incorporated 
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 on an 
annual basis. This document amends 
the current version of that order, FAA 
Order JO 7400.11K, dated August 4, 
2025, and effective September 15, 2025. 
These amendments will be published in 
the next update to FAA Order JO 
7400.11. FAA Order JO 7400.11K, 
which lists Class A, B, C, D, and E 
airspace areas, air traffic service routes, 
and reporting points, is publicly 
available as listed in the 
ADDRESSES 
section of this document.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59968 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations The Rule 
This action amends 14 CFR part 71 by 
amending VOR Federal Airway V–300 
due to the planned relocation of the 
Wiarton, ON, Canada, VOR/DME by 
NAV CANADA as part of its NAVAID 
Modernization Program. The airway 
action is described below. 
V–300: Prior to this final rule, V–300 extended between the Sault Ste Marie, 
MI, VOR/DME and the Wiarton, ON, 
Canada, VOR/DME, excluding the 
airspace within Canada. The airway is 
amended to only describe the two 
airway segments that lie within U.S. 
airspace. The first segment extends 
between the Sault Ste Marie, MI, VOR/ 
DME and the intersection of the Sault 
Ste Marie VOR/DME 125° and Pellston, MI, VORTAC 029° radials (RIBIR Fix). The second segment extends between 
the intersection of the Sault Ste Marie 
VOR/DME 125° and Pellston VORTAC 054° radials (IILND Fix), replacing the ‘‘CFNKB’’ CNF on the U.S./Canada 
border, and the intersection of the Sault 
Ste Marie VOR/DME 125° and Pellston VORTAC 067° radials (MRUCI Fix), replacing the ‘‘MKPDG’’ CNF on the 
U.S./Canada border. The two airway 
segments within U.S. airspace will 
continue to provide route continuity 
and cross-border connectivity with the 
V–300 airway segments being 
established by NAV CANADA within 
Canadian airspace. 
The NAVAID radials listed in the 
VOR Federal Airway V–300 description 
above and in the regulatory text of this 
final rule are stated in degrees True 
north. 
Regulatory Notices and Analyses 
The FAA has determined that this 
regulation only involves an established 
body of technical regulations for which 
frequent and routine amendments are 
necessary to keep them operationally 
current. It, therefore: (1) is not a 
‘‘significant regulatory action’’ under 
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
‘‘significant rule’’ under DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 
FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) 
does not warrant preparation of a 
regulatory evaluation as the anticipated 
impact is so minimal. Since this is a 
routine matter that only affects air traffic 
procedures and air navigation, it is 
certified that this rule, when 
promulgated, does not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities under the 
criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
Environmental Review 
The FAA has determined that this 
action amending Very High Frequency 
Omnidirectional Range (VOR) Federal 
Airway V–300 qualifies for categorical 
exclusion under the National 
Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 
4321, et seq.) and in accordance with FAA Order 1050.1G, FAA National 
Environmental Policy Act Implementing 
Procedures, paragraph B–2.5.(a) of FAA’s NEPA implementation policy 
and procedures which categorically 
excludes from further environmental 
impact review rulemaking actions that 
designate or modify classes of airspace 
areas, airways, routes, and reporting 
points (see 14 CFR part 71, Designation 
of Class A, B, C, D, and E Airspace 
Areas; Air Traffic Service Routes; and 
Reporting Points); and section B–2.5.(k), 
which categorically excludes from 
further environmental impact review 
publication of existing air traffic control 
procedures that do not essentially 
change existing tracks, create new 
tracks, change altitude, or change the 
concentration of aircraft on these tracks. 
As such, this action is not expected to 
result in any potentially significant 
environmental impacts. In accordance 
with the FAA’s NEPA implementation 
policy and procedures regarding 
Extraordinary Circumstances, the FAA 
has reviewed this action for factors and 
circumstances in which a normally 
categorically excluded action may have 
a significant environmental impact 
requiring further analysis. The FAA has 
determined that no extraordinary 
circumstances exist that warrant 
preparation of an environmental 
assessment or environmental impact 
study.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
History 
The FAA published a final rule in the 
Federal Register (90 FR 51507; 
November 18, 2025) amending Colored 
Federal Airway G–8, Jet Route J–115, 
and RNAV Route T–227; and 
establishing RNAV Route Q–188. 
Subsequent to the publication of that 
final rule, the FAA discovered a final 
rule previously published in the Federal 
Register (90 FR 13060; March 20, 2025) amending J–115 in Alaska. The 
amendment revoked a segment of the 
airway between the Fairbanks, AK, Very 
High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/ 
Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) and 
the Deadhorse, AK, VOR/Distance 
Measuring Equipment (DME). However, 
these changes were not reflected in the 
later-published final rule that is now 
being corrected. Specifically, in this 
now-corrected airspace action, the 
segment of J–115 between the Fairbanks, 
AK, VORTAC and the Deadhorse, AK, 
VOR/DME was included in the 
description despite having been 
previously revoked. This action corrects 
this error by removing the segment of J– 
115 between the Fairbanks, AK, 
VORTAC and the Deadhorse, AK, VOR/ 
DME from the airspace description. No 
other portion of J–115 is affected by this 
rule. 
Additionally, the FAA discovered a 
final rule previously published in the 
Federal Register (90 FR 20232; May 13, 
2025) amending G–8 in Alaska. The 
amendment revoked a segment of the 
airway between the Elfee, AK, NDB and 
the Kachemak, AK, NDB. However, 
these changes were not reflected in the 
later-published final rule that is now 
being corrected. Specifically, in this 
now-corrected airspace action, the 
segment of G–8 between the Elfee, AK, 
NDB and the Kachemak, AK, NDB was 
included in the description despite 
having been previously revoked. This 
action corrects this error by removing 
the segment of G–8 between the Elfee, 
AK, NDB and the Kachemak, AK, NDB 
from the airspace description. No other 
portion of G–8 is affected by this rule. 
Correction to the Final Rule 
Accordingly, pursuant to the 
authority delegated to me, in Docket No. 
FAA–2025–0372 as published in the 
Federal Register on November 18, 2025 
(90 FR 51507), FR Doc. 2025–20134, is

Single Convention requires that if the 
Commission on Narcotic Drugs 
(Commission) adds a substance to one of 
the schedules of such Convention, and 
the United States receives notification of 
such scheduling decision from the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations 
(Secretary-General), the United States, 
as a signatory Member State, is obligated 
to control the substance under its 
national drug control legislation. Under 
21 U.S.C. 811(d)(1) of the Controlled 
Substances Act (CSA), if control of a 
substance is required ‘‘by United States 
obligations under international treaties, 
conventions, or protocols in effect on

NFLIS-Drug represents an important resource in 
monitoring illicit drug trafficking, including the 
diversion of legally manufactured pharmaceuticals 
into illegal markets. NFLIS-Drug is a comprehensive 
information system that includes data from forensic 
laboratories that handle more than 96 percent of an 
estimated 1 million distinct annual federal, state, 
and local drug analysis cases. NFLIS-Drug includes 
drug chemistry results from completed analyses 
only. While NFLIS-Drug data are not direct 
evidence of abuse, these can lead to an inference 
that a drug has been diverted and abused. See 
Schedules of Controlled Substances: Placement of 
Carisoprodol Into Schedule IV, 76 FR 77330, 77332 
(Dec. 12, 2011).

There is no evidence suggesting that N-desethyl 
isotonitazene or N-piperidinyl etonitazene have a 
currently accepted medical use in treatment in the 
United States. To determine whether a drug or other 
substance has a currently accepted medical use, 
DEA has traditionally applied a five-part test to a 
drug or substance that has not been approved by the 
FDA: i. The drug’s chemistry must be known and 
reproducible; ii. there must be adequate safety 
studies; iii. there must be adequate and well- 
controlled studies proving efficacy; iv. the drug 
must be accepted by qualified experts; and v. the 
scientific evidence must be widely available. See 
Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial of Petition; 
Remand, 57 FR 10499 (Mar. 26, 1992), pet. for rev. denied, Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 15 F.3d 1131, 1135 (D.C. Cir. 
1994). DEA applied the traditional five-part test and 
concluded the test was not satisfied. In a recent 
published letter in a different context, HHS applied 
an additional two-part test to determine currently 
accepted medical use for substances that do not 
satisfy the five-part test: (1) whether there exists 
widespread, current experience with medical use of 
the substance by licensed health care providers 
operating in accordance with implemented 
jurisdiction-authorized programs, where medical 
use is recognized by entities that regulate the 
practice of medicine, and, if so, (2) whether there 
exists some credible scientific support for at least 
one of the medical conditions for which part (1) is 
satisfied. On April 11, 2024, the Department of 
Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) issued an 
opinion, which, among other things, concluded that 
HHS’s two-part test would be sufficient to establish 
that a drug has a currently accepted medical use. 
Office of Legal Counsel, Memorandum for Merrick 
B. Garland Attorney General Re: Questions Related 
to the Potential Rescheduling of Marijuana at 3 
(April 11, 2024). For purposes of this scheduling 
order, there is no evidence that health care 
providers have widespread experience with 
medical use of N-desethyl isotonitazene and N- 
piperidinyl etonitazene or that the use of N- 
desethyl isotonitazene and N-piperidinyl 
etonitazene are recognized by entities that regulate 
the practice of medicine, so the two-part test also 
is not satisfied. By letter dated May 11, 2023, DEA 
has been advised by HHS that there are currently 
no approved new drug applications or 
investigational new drug applications for N- 
desethyl isotonitazene and N-piperidinyl

objections to the temporary placement of N- 
desethyl isotonitazene and N-piperidinyl 
etonitazene into schedule I of the CSA.

Background 
On July 29, 2024, DEA issued a 
temporary scheduling order, placing N- 
desethyl isotonitazene and N- 
piperidinyl etonitazene temporarily in 
schedule I of the CSA.
2
That order for 
N-desethyl isotonitazene and N- 
piperidinyl etonitazene (codified at 21 
CFR 1308.11(h)(68) and (69)) was based 
on findings by the then-Administrator 
that the temporary scheduling was 
necessary to avoid an imminent hazard 
to public safety.
3
 
On November 21, 2024, the Director- 
General of the World Health 
Organization recommended to the 
Secretary-General that N-desethyl 
isotonitazene and N-piperidinyl 
etonitazene be placed in Schedule I of 
the Single Convention, as these 
substances have pharmacological effects 
similar to other opioid drugs that are 
controlled in Schedule I of the Single 
Convention. On June 9, 2025, the 
Secretariat of the United Nations 
informed the United States Government, 
by letter, that the Commission voted to 
place N-desethyl isotonitazene and N- piperidinyl etonitazene in Schedule I of 
the Single Convention during its 68th 
session on March 12, 2025 (CND Mar 
68/4 and 68/3). 
N-Desethyl Isotonitazene and N- 
Piperidinyl Etonitazene 
N-Desethyl isotonitazene and N- 
piperidinyl etonitazene are temporarily 
controlled in schedule I of the CSA 
because they pose imminent hazard to 
the public safety. Both N-desethyl 
isotonitazene and N-piperidinyl 
etonitazene belong to the 
benzimidazole-opioid drug class, 
similar to etonitazene and isotonitazene. 
Substances of the benzimidazole-opioid 
drug class share similar 
pharmacological profile with other 
opioids such as morphine and fentanyl. 
N-Desethyl isotonitazene and N- 
piperidinyl etonitazene, similar to 
morphine and fentanyl, act as mu- 
opioid receptor agonists. Adverse health 
effects have been associated with the 
abuse of these benzimidazole-opioids. 
The abuse of N-desethyl isotonitazene 
and N-piperidinyl etonitazene has been associated with several toxicology cases 
in the United States and in Europe. 
Several substances belonging to the 
benzimidazole-opioid drug class have 
been controlled in the United States, 
and as a class of drug in China, Canada, 
and the United Kingdom. The 
appearance of benzimidazole-opioids on 
the illicit drug market is similar to other 
synthetic opioids that are trafficked and 
abused for their psychoactive effects. 
Law enforcement reports demonstrate 
that N-desethyl isotonitazene and N- piperidinyl etonitazene are being 
illicitly distributed and abused. 
According to the National Forensic 
Laboratory Information System (NFLIS- 
Drug)
4
database, which collects drug 
identification results from drug cases 
submitted to and analyzed by Federal, 
State and local forensic laboratories, 
there have been 151 reports for N- 
desethyl isotonitazene and N- 
piperidinyl etonitazene between January 
2022 and July 2025 (query date: July 17, 
2025). Benzimidazole-opioids have been 
identified in counterfeit prescription 
tablets in the United States and other 
countries, including Sweden and the 
United Kingdom. The identification of 
these substances in counterfeit 
prescription drug products is of 
significant concern due to 
benzimidazole-opioids high potency. 
N-Desethyl isotonitazene and N- 
piperidinyl etonitazene have no 
currently accepted medical use in 
treatment in the United States. The 
Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS) advised DEA, by letter 
dated May 11, 2023, that based on a 
review by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), there were no 
investigational new drug applications 
(IND) or approved new drug 
applications (NDA) for N-desethyl 
isotonitazene and N-piperidinyl 
etonitazene in the United States. Since 
this letter, HHS has not advised DEA of 
any new IND or NDA for these 
substances. Because N-desethyl 
isotonitazene and N-piperidinyl 
etonitazene are not formulated or 
available for clinical use as approved 
medicinal products, all current use of 
these substances by individuals is based 
on their own initiative, rather than on 
the basis of medical advice from a 
practitioner licensed by law to 
administer such drugs. 
Consistent with 21 U.S.C. 811(d)(1), 
DEA concludes that N-desethyl 
isotonitazene and N-piperidinyl 
etonitazene have no currently accepted 
medical use in treatment in the United 
States
5
and are most appropriately 
placed permanently in schedule I of the 
CSA, the same schedule in which they 
temporarily reside at present. Because 
control is required under the Single 
Convention, DEA will not be initiating 
regular rulemaking proceedings to 
permanently schedule N-desethyl 
isotonitazene and N-piperidinyl 
etonitazene pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 
811(a). 
Conclusion 
In order to meet the United States’ 
obligation under the Single Convention 
and because N-desethyl isotonitazene 
and N-piperidinyl etonitazene have no currently accepted medical use in

treatment in the United States, the 
Administrator has determined that N- 
desethyl isotonitazene and N- 
piperidinyl etonitazene including their 
isomers, esters, ethers, salts, and salts of 
isomers, esters, and ethers, whenever 
the existence of such isomers, esters, 
and salts are possible within the specific 
existence of such isomers, esters, ethers, 
and salts are possible within the specific 
chemical designation, should be placed 
permanently in schedule I of the CSA. 
Requirements for Handling 
As discussed above, N-desethyl 
isotonitazene and N-piperidinyl 
etonitazene have been temporarily 
controlled in schedule I of the CSA 
since July 29, 2024. Upon the effective 
date of this final order, N-desethyl 
isotonitazene and N-piperidinyl 
etonitazene will be permanently subject 
to the CSA’s schedule I regulatory 
controls and administrative, civil, and

Regulatory Analyses 
Executive Orders 12866, 13563, 14192, 
and 14294 
This action is not a significant 
regulatory action as defined by 
Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 
(Regulatory Planning and Review), and 
the principles reaffirmed in E.O. 13563 
(Improving Regulation and Regulatory 
Review). DEA scheduling actions are 
not subject to E.O. 14192, Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulations, or 
E.O. 14294, Fighting 
Overcriminalization in Federal 
Regulations. This action makes no 
change in the status quo, as N-desethyl 
isotonitazene and N-piperidinyl 
etonitazene are already listed as 
schedule I controlled substances. 
Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice 
Reform 
This action meets the applicable 
standards set forth in sections 3(a) and 
3(b)(2) of E.O. 12988 to eliminate 
drafting errors and ambiguity, minimize 
litigation, provide a clear legal standard 
for affected conduct, and promote 
simplification and burden reduction. 
Executive Order 13132, Federalism 
This action does not have federalism 
implications warranting the application 
of E.O. 13132. This action does not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, 
on the relationship between the national 
government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
Executive Order 13175, Consultation 
and Coordination With Indian Tribal 
Governments 
This action does not have tribal 
implications warranting the application 
of E.O. 13175. It does not have 
substantial direct effects on one or more 
Indian tribes, on the relationship 
between the Federal government and 
Indian tribes, or on the distribution of 
power and responsibilities between the 
Federal government and Indian tribes. 
Administrative Procedure Act 
The CSA provides for an expedited 
scheduling action where control is 
required by the United States’ 
obligations under international treaties, 
conventions, or protocols.

If control is 
required pursuant to such international 
treaty, convention, or protocol, the 
Attorney General, as delegated to the 
Administrator, must issue an order

controlling such drug under the 
schedule he deems most appropriate to 
carry out such obligations, and ‘‘without 
regard to’’ the findings and rulemaking 
procedures otherwise required for 
scheduling actions in 21 U.S.C. 811(a) 
and (b). Id. 
In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 
811(d)(1), scheduling actions for drugs 
that are required to be controlled by the 
United States’ obligations under 
international treaties, conventions, or 
protocols in effect on October 27, 1970, 
shall be issued by order, as opposed to 
scheduling by rule pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 
811(a). Therefore, DEA believes that the 
notice-and-comment requirements of 
the Administrative Procedure Act 
(APA), 5 U.S.C. 553, do not apply to this 
scheduling action. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
(5 U.S.C. 601–612) applies to rules that 
are subject to notice and comment 
under the APA or any other law. As 
explained above, the CSA exempts this 
final order from notice and comment. 
Consequently, the RFA does not apply 
to this action. 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
This action does not impose a new 
collection of information requirement 
under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995.
7
Also, this action does not impose 
new or modify existing recordkeeping or 
reporting requirements on State or local 
governments, individuals, businesses, or 
organizations. However, this action does 
require compliance with the following 
existing OMB collections: 1117–0003, 
1117–0004, 1117–0006, 1117–0008, 
1117–0009, 1117–0010, 1117–0012, 
1117–0014, 1117–0021, 1117–0023, 
1117–0029, and 1117–0056. An agency 
may not conduct or sponsor, and a 
person is not required to respond to a 
collection of information unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control 
number. 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
On the basis of information contained 
in the ‘‘Regulatory Flexibility Act’’ 
section above, DEA has determined 
pursuant to the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act (UMRA) of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 
1501 et seq.) that this final rule would not result in any Federal mandate that 
may result ‘‘in the expenditure by State, 
local, and tribal governments, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector, of 
$100,000,000 or more (adjusted 
annually for inflation) in any 1 year 
. . . .’’ Therefore, neither a Small 
Government Agency Plan nor any other 
action is required under UMRA of 1995. 
Congressional Review Act 
This order is not a major rule as 
defined by the Congressional Review 
Act (CRA), 5 U.S.C. 804. However, DEA 
is submitting reports under the CRA to 
both Houses of Congress and to the 
Comptroller General.

pension plans undergoing distress or 
involuntary termination with valuation 
dates falling in 2026. This table is 
needed to compute the value of early

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
The Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation (PBGC) administers the 
pension plan termination insurance 
program under title IV of the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 
(ERISA). PBGC’s regulation on 
Allocation of Assets in Single-Employer 
Plans (29 CFR part 4044) sets forth (in 
subpart B) the methods for valuing plan 
benefits of terminating single-employer 
plans covered under title IV. Guaranteed 
benefits and benefit liabilities under a 
plan that is undergoing a distress 
termination must be valued in 
accordance with subpart B of part 4044. 
In addition, when PBGC terminates an 
underfunded plan involuntarily 
pursuant to ERISA section 4042(a), it 
uses the subpart B valuation rules to 
determine the amount of the plan’s 
underfunding. 
Expected Retirement Age Low, Medium, 
High Tables 
Under § 4044.51(b) of the asset 
allocation regulation, early retirement 
benefits are valued based on the annuity 
starting date, if a retirement date has 
been selected, or the expected 
retirement age, if the annuity starting 
date is not known on the valuation date. 
Sections 4044.55 through 4044.58 set 
forth rules for determining the expected 
retirement ages for plan participants 
entitled to early retirement benefits. 
Section 4044.58 contains tables to be 
used in determining the expected early 
retirement ages.
1
 
Table I to § 4044.58 (Selection of 
Retirement Rate Category) is used to 
determine whether a participant has a 
low, medium, or high probability of 
retiring early. The determination is 
based on the year a participant would 
reach ‘‘unreduced retirement age’’ 
(URA) (i.e., the earlier of the normal retirement age or the age at which an 
unreduced benefit is first payable) and 
the participant’s monthly benefit at the 
unreduced retirement age. The table 
applies only to plans with valuation 
dates in the current year and is updated 
annually by PBGC to reflect changes in 
the cost of living. 
Tables II–A, II–B, and II–C (Expected 
Retirement Ages for Individuals in the 
Low, Medium, and High Categories 
respectively) are used to determine the 
expected retirement age after the 
probability of early retirement has been 
determined using Table I. These tables 
establish, by probability category, the 
expected retirement age based on both 
the earliest age a participant could retire 
under the plan and the unreduced 
retirement age. This expected retirement 
age is used to compute the value of the 
early retirement benefit and, thus, the 
total value of benefits under the plan. 
This document amends § 4044.58 to 
replace Table I–25 with Table I–26 to 
provide an updated correlation, 
appropriate for calendar year 2026, 
between the amount of a participant’s 
benefit and the probability that the 
participant will elect early retirement. 
Table I–26 will be used to value benefits 
in plans with valuation dates during 
calendar year 2026. 
Missing Participants Mortality 
Assumptions 
PBGC’s regulation on Missing 
Participants (29 CFR part 4050) provides 
that the mortality assumption used to 
determine certain amounts to be 
transferred on behalf of a missing 
participant from a terminating defined 
benefit plan to PBGC is the mortality 
table in § 4044.53(h). The table currently 
provides the mortality assumption for 
benefit determination dates on or after 
July 31, 2024, but before January 1, 
2026.
2
This rule updates the table to 
provide the mortality assumption for 
benefit determination dates in 2026. 
Compliance With Regulatory 
Requirements 
PBGC has determined that notice of, 
and public comment on, this rule are 
impracticable, unnecessary, and 
contrary to the public interest. PBGC’s 
update of § 4044.58 and § 4044.53(h) for 
calendar year 2026 are routine. If a plan 
has a valuation date in 2026, the plan 
administrator needs the updated table in 
§ 4044.58 being promulgated in this rule 
to value benefits. Similarly, if a plan is 
transferring amounts on behalf of 
missing participants under part 4050, 
the plan administrator needs the 
updated mortality table in § 4044.53(h) 
for benefit determination dates in 2026. 
Accordingly, PBGC finds that the public 
interest is best served by issuing these 
tables expeditiously, without an 
opportunity for notice and comment, 
and that good cause exists for making 
the table set forth in this amendment 
effective less than 30 days after 
publication to allow the use of the 
proper tables to determine the value 
benefits for dates in early 2026. 
PBGC has determined that this action 
is not a ‘‘significant regulatory action’’

Safety Zone; West of Cyril E. King 
Airport, St. Thomas, VI 
AGENCY: Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security. 
ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone in 
the vicinity of the waters off the Cyril 
E. King Airport in St. Thomas, USVI. 
This action is necessary to protect 
personnel, vessels, and the marine 
environment from potential hazards 
created by the proximity of low flying 
aircrafts. Entry of vessels or persons into 
this zone is prohibited unless 
specifically authorized by the Captain of 
the Port Sector San Juan. 
DATES: This rule is effective from January 1, 2026, through March 31, 
2026.

§ Section 
U.S.C. United States Code 
II. Background and Authority 
On August 25, 2025, the Coast Guard 
established a temporary final rule 
establishing a safety zone for the 
runway of Cyril E. King Airport in St. 
Thomas, USVI.
1
The Coast Guard 
originally published the temporary final 
rule to be effective through September 
30, 2025. Later in October 2025 we 
promulgated a temporary interim rule to 
keep the zone open until December 31, 
2025.
2
We are now implementing 
another temporary safety zone until 
March 31, 2026, to provide an 
opportunity for comment before we 
establish a permanent safety zone. The 
Captain of the Port (COTP) San Juan has 
determined that potential hazards 
associated low flying aircrafts to vessels 
in the vicinity of the waters off the Cyril 
E. King Airport in St. Thomas, USVI 
includes wake turbulence, collision risk, 
restricted visibility, and emergency 
maneuvers. Therefore, the COTP is 
issuing this rule under the authority in 
46 U.S.C. 70034, which is needed to 
protect personnel, vessels, and the 
marine environment in the navigable 
waters within the safety zone. 
The Coast Guard is issuing this rule 
without prior notice and comment. As 
is authorized by 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the 
Coast Guard finds that good cause exists 
for not publishing a notice of proposed 
rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this 
temporary rule because there is an 
immediate need to mitigate the risk of 
vessels transiting between private port 
authority managed yellow buoys and 
the end of the St. Thomas Cyril E. King 
runway due to the proximity to low 
flying aircrafts. Prompt action is needed 
to respond to the potential safety 
hazards associated with vessels 
transiting in the proximity of the 
runway of Cyril E. King Airport in St. 
Thomas, USVI. It is impracticable and 
contrary to the public interest to publish 
an NPRM because we must establish 
this safety zone by January 1, 2026. 
For the same reasons, the Coast Guard 
finds that under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), good 
cause exists for making this rule 
effective less than 30 days after 
publication in the Federal Register. 
III. Discussion of the Rule 
This rule establishes a temporary 
safety zone for navigable waters west of 
the Cyril E. King Airport in St. Thomas, 
U.S. Virgin Islands. This temporary rule 
is effective through March 31, 2026, to 
give an opportunity for comment before 
the Coast Guard establishes a permanent 
safety zone. The temporary safety zone 
covers all navigable waters within 400 
yards from shore directly west of the 
airport’s runway within the two private 
port authority managed yellow buoys. 
No vessel or person will be permitted to 
enter the safety zone without obtaining 
permission from the COTP or a 
designated representative. No vessel or 
person will be permitted to enter the

IV. Regulatory Analyses 
We developed this rule after 
considering numerous statutes and 
Executive orders related to rulemaking. 
Below we summarize our analyses 
based on a number of these statutes and 
Executive orders. 
A. Impact on Small Entities 
The regulatory flexibility analysis 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601–612, do not 
apply to rules that are not subject to 
notice and comment. Because the Coast 
Guard has, for good cause, waived the 
notice and comment requirement that 
would otherwise apply to this 
rulemaking, the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act’s flexibility analysis provisions do 
not apply here. 
Under section 213(a) of the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104–121), 
if this rule will affect your small 
business, organization, or governmental 
jurisdiction and you have questions, 
contact the person listed in the 
FOR 
FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACTsection. 
Small businesses may send comments 
to the Small Business and Agriculture 
Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman 
and the Regional Small Business 
Regulatory Fairness Boards by calling 1– 
888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734–3247). The 
Coast Guard will not retaliate against 
small entities that question or complain 
about this rule or any policy or action 
of the Coast Guard. 
B. Collection of Information 
This rule will not call for a new 
collection of information under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3501–3520). 
C. Federalism and Indian Tribal 
Governments 
We have analyzed this rule under 
Executive Order 13132, Federalism, and 
have determined that it is consistent 
with the fundamental federalism 
principles and preemption requirements 
described in that Order. 
Also, this rule does not have tribal 
implications under Executive Order 
13175, Consultation and Coordination 
with Indian Tribal Governments, 
because it does not have a substantial 
direct effect on one or more Indian 
tribes, on the relationship between the 
Federal Government and Indian tribes, 
or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities between the Federal 
Government and Indian tribes. 
D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
As required by The Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 
1531–1538), the Coast Guard certifies 
that this rule will not result in an 
annual expenditure of $100,000,000 or 
more (adjusted for inflation) by a State, 
local, or tribal government, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector. 
E. Environment 
We have analyzed this rule under 
Department of Homeland Security 
Directive 023–01, Rev. 1, associated 
implementing instructions, and 
Environmental Planning COMDTINST 
5090.1 (series), which guide the Coast 
Guard in complying with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 
U.S.C. 4321–4370f), and have 
determined that this action is one of a 
category of actions that do not 
individually or cumulatively have a 
significant effect on the human 
environment. 
This rule is a safety zone. It is 
categorically excluded from further 
review under paragraph L60(a) of 
Appendix A, Table 1 of DHS Instruction 
Manual 023–01–001–01, Rev. 1. See the 
Record of Environmental Consideration 
supporting this determination is 
available in the docket under USCG– 
2025–1105.

Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance 
Traumatic Injury Protection Program 
Amendments 
AGENCY: Department of Veterans Affairs. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending its regulations 
that govern the Servicemembers’ Group 
Life Insurance (SGLI) Traumatic Injury 
Protection (TSGLI) program to correct 
an unintended amendment to the TSGLI 
Schedule of Losses for payments for 
inability to perform at least two 
activities of daily living (ADL) for 15, 
30, 60, and 90 consecutive day periods 
as a result of a traumatic injury other 
than a traumatic brain injury. 
DATES: This final rule is effective January 22, 2026.

Samantha Yerdon, Program Analyst, 
Insurance Service, Veterans Benefits 
Administration, (215) 842–2000, ext. 
5494. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 15, 2023, VA published a final rule in 
the Federal Register that amended its regulations governing the TSGLI 
program. 88 FR 15907. As part of this 
rulemaking, VA recodified the TSGLI 
Schedule of Losses and amended the 
eligibility standards for certain losses 
covered under the schedule. Following 
publication of the final rule, VA 
discovered that it had inadvertently 
changed the Schedule of Losses for 
inability to perform at least two ADLs as 
a result of a traumatic injury other than 
a traumatic brain injury. Neither the 
preamble to the proposed rule nor the 
preamble to the final rule addressed this 
change to the TSGLI regulation. See 85 
FR 50973; 88 FR 15907. On July 24, 
2024, VA published a proposed rule to 
correct this inadvertent change. 89 FR 
59865. VA received one comment from 
the National Veterans Legal Services 
Program (NVLSP), which we address 
below. 
The comments submitted by NVLSP 
assert that VA should leave the 
inadvertent change in the Schedule of 
Losses for the following reasons: (1) the 
TSGLI program is in good financial 
health as evidenced by the fact that VA 
has not needed to increase the TSGLI 
premium since inception; therefore, 
more generous benefits for this loss will 
not hurt the program; (2) the TSGLI 
program’s focus should be on caring for 
wounded Service members and should 
not distinguish between temporary and 
permanent injuries; and (3) VA is not 
legally required to consult with the 
Department of Defense (DoD) in 
updating the TSGLI regulations 
published in March 2023. 
Financial Health of TSGLI 
TSGLI became effective on December 
1, 2005. The program provides 
payments to Service members and 
Veterans who are insured by SGLI and 
suffer a serious traumatic injury in 
service resulting in a loss that qualifies 
for payment under TSGLI. TSGLI 
benefits are also payable retroactively to 
any member who suffered a traumatic 
injury from October 7, 2001, to 
November 30, 2005, resulting in a 
qualifying injury, regardless of whether 
they had SGLI coverage at the time of 
the injury. TSGLI premiums are $1.00 
per month and are intended to cover 
only the civilian incidence of such 
injuries. The uniformed services fund 
the cost of claims in excess of premiums 
collected, with such claims attributed to 
the extra hazards of military service. 
Extra hazards funding in TSGLI was 
needed during periods of U.S. military 
involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 
addition, the uniformed services pay for 
the total cost of retroactive claims. The 
TSGLI fund balance as of June 30, 2024, 
was $60.1 million. Of this, $28 million 
was contributed by DoD as start-up 
funds when the program began and is 
therefore earmarked for extra hazards 
costs. In addition, a portion of the 
remaining fund balance must be set 
aside to account for the lag in reporting 
of claims. 
An analysis of the claims experience 
for policy years 2015 to 2024 indicates 
that TSGLI payments using the shorter 
time periods for the TSGLI Schedule of 
Losses for Other Traumatic Injury (OTI) 
resulting in inability to perform ADLs 
(15, 30, 60, 90 days) would have 
resulted in an additional 1,385 claims 
and an increase of $34.6 million in 
payout. Additionally, the shorter time 
period for payment would have resulted 
in claims and administrative expenses 
exceeding premium collections for eight 
of the past 10 policy years. The 
additional claim payments using the 
shorter timeframes average 
approximately $3.5 million per year 
over the past 10 policy years. Assuming 
that OTI ADL loss experience trends 
similarly going forward, premium 
collections will cover only about 81% of 
claims and administrative expenses. 
Consequently, use of the shorter time 
periods for the Schedule of Losses for 
OTI would put upward pressure on the 
TSGLI premium rate in the long term. 
While program surplus can be used to 
supplement this deficit in the short 
term, it is necessary for the program to 
maintain a sufficient fund balance to 
guard against the risk of future conflicts 
or events resulting in significant injuries 
that may cause spikes in claims. 
Temporary and Permanent Injuries 
VA explained in the proposed 
rulemaking that leaving the shorter 
payment intervals as they currently are 
codified could ‘‘potentially result in 
higher payout amounts to individuals 
with severe but temporary injuries than 
those paid to injured servicemembers 
who have permanent injuries.’’ 89 FR at 
59866. As required by 38 U.S.C. 
1980A(j), VA has consulted with the 
uniformed services, and DoD does not 
support the inadvertent change to the 
payment standard. VA and DoD note 
that in the original TSGLI interim final 
rulemaking published on December 22, 
2005 (70 FR 75940, 75943), VA stated, 
‘‘As required by 38 U.S.C. 1980A(d), the 
amount of the payment in the schedule 
. . . is based on the severity of the 
member’s loss.’’ Severity includes not 
only the length of recovery period for 
the loss but the nature of the injury 
itself, such as its permanence. Program 
experience demonstrates that the time 
periods of 15, 30, 60, and 90 days of loss 
of ADL due to traumatic brain injury 
(TBI) clearly indicate a severe injury 
with lasting impacts on the member’s 
functions. However, the same cannot be 
said for the time period of 15 days of 
loss of ADL due to OTI. Since the 
inception of the program, denied claims 
that do not meet the time period of 30 
days’ loss of ADL due to OTI show less 
severe injuries of a more temporary 
nature, including bone fractures, 
lacerations, and torn ligaments. DoD 
and VA both agree that the initial 
justification for the payment standard 
should remain as valid rationale for 
maintaining the standard at the lower, 
instead of higher, payment amount. 
VA Consultation With DoD Not 
Required 
NVLSP also commented that there 
was no legal mandate that VA follow 
DoD guidance following consultation 
with the uniformed services under 38 
U.S.C. 1980A(j), and even if such 
consultation was required, there is no 
evidence that DoD has publicly stated 
their opposition to the change in 
standard from the 2023 final 
rulemaking. 
First and foremost, 38 U.S.C. 1980A(j) 
does not require DoD to provide public 
statements as to the nature of the 
consultation or position prior to VA 
implementing TSGLI rulemaking. VA 
supports DoD’s ongoing consultation on 
the TSGLI regulations as the program 
evolves because, although VA may 
promulgate TSGLI regulations, it is 
within the exclusive purview of the 
uniformed services to certify TSGLI 
claims, and VA plays no role in the 
adjudication process under 38 U.S.C. 
1980A(f). Furthermore, DoD staff meet 
with VA staff and other Department 
officials each year as required by statute 
(38 U.S.C. 1974), and DoD involvement 
in TSGLI warrants a fair measure of 
deference from VA when evaluating and 
responding to feedback from DoD. 
Adopting regulations that contradict 
DoD feedback may not only be costly 
and inconsistent with actuarially sound 
business principles but also would not 
be aligned with improvements to the 
customer experience for the TSGLI 
program, which were implicit in the 
purpose, design, and intent of the TSGLI 
Year Ten Review. 
Additionally, in the case of the 
regulatory publication error in March 
2023, the uniformed services under DoD 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59979 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations were the first to identify the issue in late 
Spring 2023 and raise the concern to VA 
that this change was never 
contemplated during the intensive 
collaboration with DoD and the services 
in the TSGLI Year Ten Review. Their 
concern arose from whether VA had 
made a change in OTI vs. TBI losses 
related to severity of injury in 
opposition to the long-standing 
rationale of the program they 
understood and supported. VA assured 
DoD and the uniformed services that the 
change was an inadvertent 
typographical error, and no change had 
been intended. 
Based on the foregoing, VA adopts the 
proposed rule, without change, as a 
final rule. 
Executive Orders 12866, 13563, and 
14192 
VA examined the impact of this 
rulemaking as required by Executive 
Orders 12866 (Sept. 30, 1993) and 13563 
(Jan. 18, 2011), which direct agencies to 
assess all costs and benefits of available 
regulatory alternatives and, if regulation 
is necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits. 
The Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs has determined that 
this final rule is not a significant 
regulatory action under E.O. 12866. 
Through this rulemaking, VA will 
restore the intended payment schedule 
for TSGLI benefits, thereby preventing 
confusion and unnecessary re- 
processing of claims. Absent this 
rulemaking, VA staff would continue to 
spend more time adjudicating appeals 
and handling inconsistencies from the 
current payment structure. While VA is 
unable to quantify measurable cost 
savings, these qualitative benefits will 
generate positive outcomes to society, 
such as reductions in burden and 
confusion among stakeholders. This 
final rule is a deregulatory action under 
Executive Order 14192 as it removes an 
unintended burden and provides a net 
positive benefit to society. 
Economic Impact: There are no costs 
or savings associated with this final 
rule. This rule ensures the TSGLI is 
managed according to actuarially sound 
principles, maintaining the TSGLI 
premium at a low rate. TSGLI is funded 
by the premiums that Service members 
pay for TSGLI coverage, and as such, 
there will be no cost to the Government 
with this final rulemaking. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Secretary hereby certifies that 
this final rule will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities as they are 
defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(5 U.S.C. 601–612). The overall impact 
of this final rule would be of no benefit 
or detriment to small businesses. 
Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), 
the initial and final regulatory flexibility 
analysis requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 
and 604 do not apply. 
Unfunded Mandates 
This final rule will not result in the 
expenditure by State, local, and Tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector, of $100 million or more 
(adjusted annually for inflation) in any 
one year. 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
Although this final rule contains 
collection of information under the 
provisions of the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501–3521), there 
are no provisions associated with this 
rulemaking constituting any new 
collection of information or any 
revisions to the existing collection of 
information. The collection of 
information for 38 CFR 9.21 is currently 
approved by the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) and have been 
assigned OMB control number 2900– 
0919. 
Assistance Listing 
The Assistance Listing number and 
title for the program affected by this 
document is 64.103, Life Insurance for

Congressional Review Act 
Pursuant to Congressional Review

Information and Regulatory Affairs 
designated this rule as not a major rule, 
as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

I. General Information 
A. Introduction 
In the Auction 113 Procedures Public 
Notice, the Office of Economics and Analytics (OEA), jointly with the 
Wireless Telecommunications Bureau 
(WTB), establishes the procedures to be 
used for Auction 113, the auction of 200 
Advanced Wireless Services licenses for 
spectrum in the Commission’s inventory 
in the 1695–1710 MHz, 1755–1780 
MHz, and 2155–2180 MHz bands 
(collectively, the ‘‘AWS–3’’ bands). 
Auction 113, which marks the Federal 
Communications Commission’s 
(Commission) first auction since its 
authority to use competitive bidding 
lapsed in 2023, will bring unused, 
valuable 5G-ready spectrum to market, 
and proceeds will fund the 
Commission’s ongoing efforts to protect 
American networks from untrustworthy 
and insecure foreign equipment. 
Bidding in Auction 113 is scheduled 
to commence on June 2, 2026. Auction 
113 will be conducted using an 
ascending clock auction with a supply 
of one in each category of frequency- 
specific channel blocks, referred to as 
the ‘‘clock-1’’ auction format. The 
Auction 113 Procedures Public Notice 
provides details regarding the 
procedures, terms, conditions, dates, 
and deadlines governing participation 
in Auction 113 bidding, as well as an 
overview of the post-auction application 
and payment processes. 
B. Background and Relevant Authority 
The Commission is offering licenses 
in Auction 113 pursuant to the 
Spectrum and Secure Technology and 
Innovation Act of 2024 (Spectrum and 
Secure Technology and Innovation Act). 
The Spectrum and Secure Technology 
and Innovation Act directs the 
Commission to initiate a system of 
competitive bidding under 47 U.S.C. 
309(j) to grant licenses for spectrum in 
its inventory in the AWS–3 bands as of 
December 23, 2024. See Servicemember Quality of Life Improvement and 
National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2025, Public Law 118–159, 
Div. E, Title LIV, §§ 5401–5405, § 5403. 
Auction proceeds will support the 
Commission’s Supply Chain 
Reimbursement Program, which 
implements the Secure and Trusted 
Communications Networks Act of 2019 
by reimbursing eligible advanced 
communications service providers for 
their costs to remove, replace, and 
dispose of Huawei Technologies 
Company or ZTE Corporation 
equipment and services obtained on or 
before June 30, 2020. 
On March 11, 2025, in accordance 
with 47 U.S.C. 309(j)(3), OEA and WTB 
released the Auction 113 Comment 
Public Notice, 90 FR 13117 (March 20, 
2025), seeking comment on certain 
competitive bidding and other various 
procedures to be used in Auction 113. 
Ten parties filed comments in response 
to the Auction 113 Comment Public 
Notice, and six parties filed reply comments. 
One commenter recommends that 
funds from spectrum auctions and 
licenses be strategically and primarily 
directed towards expanding rural Tribal 
cellular services and communications 
infrastructure support on Tribal lands 
rather than for incumbent 
reimbursement. No parties commented 
on this recommendation. Even if this 
recommendation did not conflict with 
Congress’s express direction for the 
Auction 113 proceeds, the use of 
auction proceeds is outside the scope of 
this proceeding on auction procedures 
as well as outside the scope of OEA’s 
and WTB’s delegated authority. 
The Commission’s rules and decisions 
provide the underlying authority for the 
procedures OEA and WTB adopt for 
Auction 113. As specified in 47 CFR 
27.1105, any auction of licenses for 
spectrum in the AWS–3 band is to be 
governed by the bidding procedures set 
forth in 47 CFR part 1, subpart Q. The 
Commission has also adopted rules 
regarding the AWS–3 bands, as well as 
the licensing and operating rules that 
are applicable to all 47 CFR part 27 
services. See 2014 AWS–3 Report and Order, 79 FR 32366 (June 4, 2014). On July 24, 2025, the Commission adopted 
the 2025 AWS–3 Report and Order, 90 FR 36385 (August 4, 2025), in which it 
updated the designated entity 
provisions of the 47 CFR part 27 rules 
that had applied to the Commission’s 
first auction of AWS–3 spectrum in 
2014. One commenter requests that OEA 
and WTB adopt an accelerated two-year 
buildout deadline for Auction 113 
winning bidders because it claims that 
doing so will favor bidders with the 
financial capacity, operational 
readiness, and technical sophistication 
to promptly deploy service as well as 
discourage ‘‘speculative bidding.’’ Four 
commenters oppose this request. The 
Commission adopted buildout rules for 
the AWS–3 bands in the 2014 AWS–3 
Report and Order, and any amendments 
to those rules require a rulemaking 
proceeding and cannot be made in the 
context of establishing the procedures 
for Auction 113 because such action is 
outside the scope of OEA’s and WTB’s 
delegated authority. 
Prospective applicants should 
familiarize themselves with the 47 CFR 
part 1, subpart Q rules, including 
amendments and clarifications thereto, 
as well as Commission decisions 
regarding competitive bidding 
procedures, application requirements, 
and obligations of Commission 
licensees. In addition, applicants must 
be thoroughly familiar with the 
procedures, terms, and conditions 
contained in the Auction 113 
Procedures Public Notice and any future 
public notices that may be released in 
this proceeding. 
The terms contained in the 
Commission’s rules, relevant orders, 
and public notices are not negotiable. 
OEA and WTB may amend or 
supplement the information contained 
in their public notices at any time, and 
may issue public notices to convey any 
new or supplemental information that 
may generally apply to applicants. 
Pursuant to the Commission’s rules, 
OEA and WTB also retain the authority 
to implement further procedures during 
the course of this auction. It is the 
responsibility of all applicants to remain 
current with all Commission rules and 
with all public notices pertaining to 
Auction 113.

in Auction 113 
The AWS–3 spectrum available in 
Auction 113 will be licensed on a 
geographic area basis. Of the 200 
licenses offered in Auction 113, the 48 
licenses located in the A1 block (1695– 
1700 MHz), B1 block (1700–1710 MHz), 
H block (1760–1765/2160–2165), I block 
(1765–1770/2165–2170), and J block 
(1770–1780 MHz/2170–2180 MHz) are 
based on Economic Areas (EAs) and the 
152 located in the G block (1755–1760/ 
2155–2160) are based on Cellular 
Market Areas (CMAs). The AWS–3 
frequencies will be licensed in five and 
ten megahertz blocks, with each license 
having a total bandwidth of five, ten, or 
twenty megahertz. The list of licenses to 
be offered in Auction 113 is available in 
the Attachment A file on the Auction 
113 website at www.fcc.gov/auction/ 
113. 
One commenter requests that Block G 
be redefined using county level 
geographic areas for Auction 113, rather 
than on a CMA basis, as specified in 47 
CFR part 27. However, implementing 
such a change would require an 
amendment to the Commission’s part 27 
rules that must be adopted in a 
rulemaking proceeding. A Commission 
rule cannot be amended in the context 
of this proceeding establishing the 
procedures for Auction 113 because 
such action is outside the scope of 
OEA’s and WTB’s delegated authority. 
OEA and WTB did not seek comment 
on establishing a Tribal licensing 
window for AWS–3 spectrum inventory 
in the Auction 113 Comment Public 
Notice, however five parties commented on this topic. The Commission declined 
in the 2025 AWS–3 Report and Order to 
implement a Tribal licensing window 
for Auction 113, and has therefore 
resolved this issue. 
The 1695–1710 MHz band will be 
licensed in an unpaired configuration 
for low-power mobile transmit (i.e., 
uplink) operations. The 1755–1780 MHz 
band will be licensed paired with the 
2155–2180 MHz band, with the 1755– 
1780 MHz band authorized for low- 
power mobile transmit (i.e., uplink) operations and the 2155–2180 MHz 
band authorized for base station and 
fixed (i.e., downlink) operations. Figure 1 in the Auction 113 Comment 
Public Notice shows the band plan for 
the 1695–1710 MHz band. Figure 2 in 
the Auction 113 Comment Public Notice shows the band plans for the 1755–1780 
MHz and 2155–2180 MHz bands. Table

responsible for investigating and 
evaluating all technical and marketplace 
factors that may have a bearing on the 
potential uses of a license that it may 
seek in Auction 113. In addition to the 
typical due diligence considerations 
that the Commission encourages of 
bidders in all auctions, OEA and WTB 
call particular attention in Auction 113 
to the incumbency issues in the 1695– 
1710 MHz, 1755–1780 MHz, and 2155– 
2180 MHz bands and protection of 
Federal and non-Federal incumbent 
operations described herein. Each 
applicant should closely follow releases 
from the Commission concerning these 
issues and consider carefully the 
technical and economic implications for 
commercial use of the AWS–3 band. 
The Commission makes no 
representations or warranties about the 
use of this spectrum for particular 
services, or about the information in 
Commission databases that is furnished 
by outside parties. 
D. Incumbency Issues 
The AWS–3 bands are currently being 
used for a variety of government and 
non-government services. In the 2014 
AWS–3 Report and Order, the 
Commission allocated the 1695–1710 
MHz band for non-Federal fixed and 
mobile (except aeronautical mobile) 
commercial use and the 1755–1780 
MHz band for non-Federal fixed and 
mobile commercial use. Licenses in the 
1695–1710 MHz band are being made 
available on a shared basis with 
incumbent Federal meteorological- 
satellite (MetSat) data users. The 
Commission adopted twenty-seven 
Protection Zones for the 1695–1710 
MHz band in the 2014 AWS–3 Report 
and Order, and the forty-seven Federal 
earth stations located in these Protection 
Zones will operate on a co-equal, 
primary basis with commercial AWS–3 
licensees. All other Federal earth 
stations operate on a secondary basis. In 
order to facilitate coordination, uplink/ 
mobile transmit devices in the 1695– 
1710 MHz band must be under the 
control of, or associated with, a base 
station as a means to facilitate shared 
use of the band and prevent interference 
to Federal operations. 
Licenses in the 1755–1780 MHz band 
are being made available on a shared 
basis with a limited number of Federal 
incumbents indefinitely, and some 
Federal systems that have or will over 
time relocate out of the band. The 
Federal systems located in the 
Protection Zones adopted by the 
Commission for the 1755–1780 MHz 
band in the 2014 AWS–3 Report and 
Order will operate on a co-equal, primary basis with commercial AWS 
licensees. The Federal systems that will 
relocate from the band pursuant to an 
approved transition plan will operate on 
a primary basis until they are 
reaccommodated. In order to facilitate 
coordination, uplink/mobile transmit 
devices in the 1755–1780 MHz band 
must be under the control of, or 
associated with, a base station as a 
means to facilitate shared use of the 
band and prevent interference to 
Federal operations. NTIA issues annual 
reports on the status of the transitions 
of spectrum in the 1695–1710 MHz and 
1755–1780 MHz bands. See, e.g., 
https://www.ntia.doc.gov/report/2024/ 
2023-commercial-spectrum- 
enhancement-act-csea-report. See also

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59982 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations Licenses to operate in the 1695–1710 
MHz and 1755–1780 MHz bands are 
subject to the condition that the licensee 
must not cause harmful interference to 
an incumbent Federal entity relocating 
from these bands under an approved 
Transition Plan. This condition remains 
in effect until the National 
Telecommunications and Information 
Administration (NTIA) terminates the 
applicable authorization of the 
incumbent Federal entity. Although this 
license condition does not apply to the 
permanent sharing scenario, the 
Commission’s rules require successful 
coordination to avoid causing harmful 
interference to these Federal 
incumbents. In addition, AWS–3 
licensees in the 1755–1780 MHz band 
must agree to accept interference from 
incumbent Federal users while they 
remain authorized to operate in the 
band. The 2155–2180 MHz band is 
already allocated for exclusive non- 
Federal, commercial use. Although no 
Federal users are currently licensed or 
operating in the 2155–2180 MHz band, 
AWS–3 licensees may have to protect or 
relocate and/or share in the cost of 
relocating non-Federal incumbent Fixed 
Microwave and Broadband Radio 
Service licensees in the band. 
AWS–3 licensees in the 1695–1710 
MHz and 1755–1780 MHz bands are 
required to successfully coordinate with 
Federal incumbent users in these bands 
prior to operating in designated 
protection zones. The 2014 AWS–3 
Report and Order established that 1695– 
1710 MHz licensees operating at certain 
power levels are required to coordinate 
with Federal incumbents in those 
protection zones, and higher-powered 
operations would generally require 
nationwide coordination. Similarly, 
operations in the 1755–1780 MHz band 
are subject to successful coordination 
with Federal incumbents in the 
protection zones adopted for that band, 
with the default coordination zone 
being nationwide. Prior to commencing 
operations in the 1755–1780 MHz band, 
an AWS–3 licensee must reach a 
coordination arrangement on an 
operator-to-operator basis with each 
Federal agency that has an assignment 
with United States and Possessions 
authority. The FCC/NTIA Coordination 
Procedures Public Notice, 79 FR 54710 
(September 12, 2014), contains various 
refinements to the previously-defined 
protection zones for each of these bands. 
The FCC/NTIA Coordination Procedures Public Notice also provides information 
and guidance on the overall 
coordination process for these bands, as 
contemplated by the 2014 AWS–3 
Report and Order, including informal 
pre-coordination discussion and the 
formal process of submitting 
coordination requests to, and receiving 
responses from, relevant Federal 
agencies. OEA and WTB encourage each 
potential applicant to carefully review 
these coordination requirements and the 
policies and procedures adopted by the 
Commission to implement them, and to 
consider the impact of those 
requirements and policies on the 
potential applicant’s business plans. 
One commenter expresses opposition 
to Federal spectrum sharing and 
coordination requirements for the 
AWS–3 bands because he contends that 
they create challenges for bidders and 
could deter participation or lead to 
underutilized spectrum. These 
arguments are outside the scope of this 
proceeding, and as such, OEA and WTB 
do not address them. The Commission 
adopted rules for the spectrum sharing 
and coordination requirements for the 
AWS–3 bands in the 2014 AWS–3 
Report and Order. Amendments to those 
rules require a rulemaking proceeding 
and cannot be adopted in the context of 
establishing the procedures for Auction 
113 because such action is outside the 
scope of OEA’s and WTB’s delegated 
authority. 
E. Auction Specifics 
1. Auction Title and Start Date 
The auction of licenses for spectrum 
in the Commission’s inventory in the 
AWS–3 bands will be referred to as 
‘‘Auction 113.’’ Bidding in Auction 113 
will begin on June 2, 2026. The initial 
schedule for bidding rounds in Auction 
113 will be announced by public notice 
at least one week before bidding begins. 
Unless otherwise announced, bidding 
on all licenses will be conducted on 
each business day until bidding has 
stopped on all licenses.

3. Auction Delay, Suspension, or 
Cancellation 
OEA and WTB adopt their proposal 
that at any time before or during the 
bidding process, OEA, in conjunction 
with WTB, may delay, suspend, or 
cancel bidding in Auction 113 in the 
event of a natural disaster, technical 
obstacle, network interruption, 
administrative or weather necessity, 
evidence of an auction security breach 
or unlawful bidding activity, or for any 
other reason that affects the fair and 
efficient conduct of competitive 
bidding. This approach has proven 
effective in resolving exigent 
circumstances in previous auctions, and 
OEA and WTB find no reason to depart 
from it here. OEA will notify 
participants of any such delay, 
suspension, or cancellation by public 
notice and/or through the FCC Auction 
Bidding System’s (bidding system) 
announcement function. If the bidding 
is delayed or suspended, then OEA may, 
in its sole discretion, elect to resume the 
auction starting from the beginning of 
the current round or from some 
previous round, or cancel the auction in 
its entirety. OEA and WTB emphasize 
that they will exercise the authority to 
delay, suspend, or cancel bidding in 
Auction 113 solely at their discretion. 
4. Requirements for Participation

F. Educational Materials 
Before the opening of the short-form 
filing window for Auction 113, detailed 
educational information will be 
provided in various formats to potential 
participants on the Auction 113 web 
page. Specifically, OEA will provide 
various materials on the pre-bidding 
processes in advance of the opening of 
the short-form application window, 
beginning with the release of step-by-

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59983 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations step instructions for completing the FCC 
Form 175 in the FCC’s Auction 
Application System (AAS), which is the 
Commission’s newly developed system 
that will be used for the first time in 
Auction 113. These materials will be 
available in the Education section on 
the Auction 113 website at www.fcc.gov/ 
auction/113. In addition, OEA will provide an online application 
procedures tutorial for the auction, 
covering information on pre-bidding 
preparation, completing short-form 
applications, and the application review 
process. Applicants should carefully 
review both the Auction 113 application 
tutorial and the FCC Form 175 filing 
instructions, paying close attention to 
any departures from previous 
application processes as a result of the 
use of the new AAS for Auction 113. 
In advance of the start of the mock 
auction, OEA will provide educational 
materials on the bidding procedures for 
Auction 113, including a user guide for 
the bidding system, bidding system file 
formats, and an online bidding 
procedures tutorial. These materials will 
provide detailed information on bidding 
features specific to the ascending clock 
auction format, including intra-round 
bidding and proxy bids. OEA and WTB 
recognize the importance of these 
materials to applicants’ and bidders’ 
comprehension of the bidding 
procedures OEA and WTB adopt herein. 
Accordingly, the educational materials 
will be released as soon as reasonably 
possible to provide potential applicants 
and bidders with time to understand 
them and ask questions of Commission 
staff before bidding begins. 
OEA and WTB believe that parties 
interested in participating in Auction 
113 will find the interactive, online 
tutorials an efficient and effective way 
to further their understanding of the 
application and bidding processes. The 
online tutorials will allow viewers to 
navigate the presentation outline, 
review written notes, and listen to audio 
of the notes. Additional features of these 
web-based tools include links to 
auction-specific Commission releases, 
email links for contacting Commission 
staff, and screen shots of the online 
application and bidding systems. The 
online tutorials will be accessible in the 
Education section on the Auction 113 
website at www.fcc.gov/auction/113. 
Once posted, the tutorials will remain 
continuously accessible. 
One commenter advocates for 
additional educational support in the 
form of personalized and interactive 
tools for less experienced participants, 
claiming that the educational resources 
the Commission makes available to 
participants are often too generalized for 
bidders to apply to their particular 
circumstances. The Commission 
currently offers a wide variety of 
educational materials, demonstrations, 
educational opportunities, and other 
information and resources to assist 
prospective applicants and bidders with 
understanding the FCC’s auction 
application system and the bidding 
system. Moreover, individual 
prospective applicants and bidders can 
address specific questions to 
Commission staff well in advance of all 
auction deadlines. As a result, OEA and 
WTB conclude that the added benefit, if 
any, of developing personalized and 
interactive educational tools in time for 
Auction 113 is outweighed by the time 
and expense that Commission would 
incur to customize such resources. 
II. Pre-Bidding Activities and 
Considerations 
A. Due Diligence 
OEA and WTB remind each potential 
bidder that it is solely responsible for 
investigating and evaluating all 
technical and marketplace factors that 
may have a bearing on the value of the 
licenses that it is seeking in Auction 113 
and that it is required to certify, under 
penalty of perjury, that it has read the 
Auction 113 Procedures Public Notice 
and has familiarized itself with the 
auction procedures and the service rules 
for the AWS–3 bands. The Commission 
makes no representations or warranties 
about the use of this spectrum or these 
licenses for particular services. Each 
applicant should be aware that a 
Commission auction represents an 
opportunity to become a Commission 
licensee, subject to certain conditions 
and regulations. This includes the 
established authority of the Commission 
to alter the terms of existing licenses by 
rulemaking, which is equally applicable 
to licenses awarded by auction. A 
Commission auction does not constitute 
an endorsement by the Commission of 
any particular service, technology, or 
product, nor does a Commission license 
constitute a guarantee of business 
success. 
An applicant should perform its due 
diligence research and analysis before 
proceeding, as it would with any new 
business venture. In particular, OEA 
and WTB encourage each potential 
bidder to perform technical analyses 
and/or refresh its previous analyses to 
assure itself that, should it become a 
winning bidder for any Auction 113 
license, it will be able to build and 
operate facilities that will fully comply 
with all applicable technical and legal 
requirements. OEA and WTB urge each 
applicant to inspect any prospective 
sites for communications facilities 
located in, or near, the geographic area 
for which it plans to bid, confirm the 
availability of such sites, and to 
familiarize itself with the Commission’s 
rules regarding the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the 
National Historic Preservation Act 
(NHPA), and any other environmental 
statutes that may apply. 
In August 2025, the Commission 
released the Modernizing the 
Commission’s National Environmental 
Policy Act Rules NPRM, 90 FR 40295 
(August 19, 2025), to consider updates 
to its rules implementing NEPA. 
Potential bidders in Auction 113 should 
be mindful that if the Commission 
amends its NEPA rules, AWS–3 
licensees will be subject to the amended 
rules. 
OEA and WTB also encourage each 
applicant in Auction 113 to continue to 
conduct its own research throughout the 
auction in order to determine the 
existence of pending or future 
administrative or judicial proceedings 
that might affect its decision on 
continued participation in the auction. 
Each applicant is responsible for 
assessing the likelihood of the various 
possible outcomes and for considering 
the potential impact on licenses 
available in an auction. The due 
diligence considerations mentioned in 
the Auction 113 Procedures Public Notice do not constitute an exhaustive list of steps that should be undertaken 
prior to participating in Auction 113. As 
always, the burden is on the potential 
bidder to determine how much research 
to undertake, depending upon the 
specific facts and circumstances related 
to its interests. For example, applicants 
should pay particular attention to the 
requirements presented by the 
temporary and indefinite sharing of 
portions of the AWS–3 bands by 
incumbent Federal users and AWS–3 
licensees, which may vary by geography 
and frequency. The FCC/NTIA 
Coordination Procedures Public Notice 
contains additional information 
regarding the extent of sharing in the 
AWS–3 bands, refinements to the 
protection zones adopted in the 2014 
AWS–3 Report and Order, and 
information and guidance on the overall 
coordination process between 
commercial and Federal users. OEA and 
WTB expect that the information in both 
the FCC/NTIA Coordination Procedures Public Notice and federal agencies’ 
approved transition plans will be 
material to an applicant’s potential 
participation in Auction 113. Therefore, 
OEA and WTB strongly encourage each 
applicant to closely review these 
materials, as well as future releases from 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59984 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations the Commission and NTIA concerning 
these issues, and to carefully consider 
the technical and economic 
implications for commercial use of the 
AWS–3 bands. 
Applicants are solely responsible for 
identifying associated risks and for 
investigating and evaluating the degree 
to which such matters may affect their 
ability to bid on, otherwise acquire, or 
make use of the licenses available in 
Auction 113. Each potential bidder is 
responsible for undertaking research to 
ensure that any licenses won in the 
auction will be suitable for its business 
plans and needs. Each potential bidder 
must undertake its own assessment of 
the relevance and importance of 
information gathered as part of its due 
diligence efforts. 
The Commission makes no 
representations or guarantees regarding 
the accuracy or completeness of 
information in its databases or any 
third-party databases, including, for 
example, court docketing systems. To 
the extent the Commission’s databases 
may not include all information deemed 
necessary or desirable by an applicant, 
it must obtain or verify such 
information from independent sources 
or assume the risk of any 
incompleteness or inaccuracy in said 
databases. Furthermore, the 
Commission makes no representations 
or guarantees regarding the accuracy or 
completeness of information that has 
been provided by incumbent licensees 
and incorporated into its databases. 
B. Licensing Considerations 
In addition to the incumbency issues 
discussed in the Auction 113 
Procedures Public Notice, potential 
bidders should be aware of the 
following licensing considerations 
concerning the use of the AWS–3 
frequencies they acquire in Auction 113. 
1. International Coordination 
Potential bidders seeking licenses for 
geographic areas adjacent to the 
Canadian and Mexican borders should 
be aware that the use of the AWS–3 
frequencies they acquire in Auction 113 
are subject to current and future 
agreements with the governments of 
Canada and Mexico. 
The Commission routinely works 
with the United States Department of 
State and Canadian and Mexican 
government officials to ensure the 
efficient use of the spectrum as well as 
interference-free operations in the 
border areas near Canada and Mexico. 
Until such time as any adjusted 
agreements, as needed, between the 
United States, Mexico, and/or Canada 
can be agreed to, operations in the 
AWS–3 bands must not cause harmful 
interference across the border, 
consistent with the terms of the 
agreements currently in force. 
2. Environmental Review Requirements 
Licensees must comply with the 
Commission’s rules for environmental 
review under the NEPA, the NHPA, and 
any other environmental statutes that 
may apply. Licensees and other 
applicants that propose to build certain 
types of communications facilities for 
licensed service must follow 
Commission procedures implementing 
obligations under NEPA and NHPA 
prior to constructing the facilities. 
Under NEPA, a licensee or applicant 
must assess if certain environmentally 
sensitive conditions specified in the 
Commission’s rules are relevant to the 
proposed facilities, and prepare an 
environmental assessment when 
applicable. If an environmental 
assessment is required, then facilities 
may not be constructed until 
environmental processing is completed. 
Under NHPA, a licensee or applicant 
must follow the procedures in 47 CFR 
1.1320, as well as the Nationwide 
Programmatic Agreement for 
Collocation of Wireless Antennas and 
the Nationwide Programmatic Agreement Regarding the Section 106 
National Historic Preservation Act 
Review Process (see 47 CFR pt. 1, Appendices B and C). Compliance with 
section 106 of the NHPA requires Tribal 
consultation, and if construction of the 
communications facilities would have 
adverse effects on historic or Tribally 
significant properties, an environmental 
assessment must be prepared. 
3. Mobile Spectrum Holdings 
OEA and WTB remind bidders of the 
Commission’s mobile spectrum 
holdings policies applicable to the 
AWS–3 band. Specifically, the 
Commission did not impose a pre- 
auction bright-line limit on acquisitions 
of the AWS–3 band. The Commission 
also determined that it would perform 
case-by-case review of proposed 
secondary market transactions once 
AWS–3 was found suitable and 
available for the provision of mobile 
telephony/broadband services. All 65 
megahertz of AWS–3 spectrum have 
been found suitable and available and 
are currently included in the spectrum 
screen. 
4. Quiet Zones 
AWS–3 licensees must individually 
apply for and receive a separate license 
for each transmitter if the proposed 
operation will affect the radio quiet 
zones set forth in the Commission’s 
rules. 
C. Short-Form Applications: Due Before 
6:00 p.m. ET on February 11, 2026 
In order to be eligible to bid in 
Auction 113, an applicant must first 
follow the procedures to submit a short- 
form application (FCC Form 175) 
electronically via the FCC’s Auction 
Application Portal, following the 
instructions set forth in the FCC Form 
175 Instructions. The short-form 
application will become available with 
the opening of the initial filing window 
and must be submitted prior to 6:00 
p.m. ET on February 11, 2026. Late 
applications will not be accepted. No 
application fee is required for short- 
form applications. However, in 
Amendment of the Schedule of 
Application Fees, 86 FR 15026 (March 
19, 2021), the Commission adopted a 
long-form application filing fee that 
includes an amount to recover costs for 
processing the short-form application, 
and each Auction 113 winning bidder 
must submit the filing fee prescribed in 
47 CFR 1.1102 with each separate long- 
form application. 
Applications may be filed at any time 
beginning at 12:00 p.m. ET on January 
26, 2026, until the filing window closes 
at 6:00 p.m. ET on February 11, 2026. 
Applicants are strongly encouraged to 
file early and are responsible for 
allowing adequate time for filing their 
applications. There are no limits or 
restrictions on the number of times an 
application can be updated or amended 
until the initial filing deadline on 
February 11, 2026. 
An applicant must always click on the 
CERTIFY & SUBMIT button on the 
Certify & Submit screen to successfully 
submit its FCC Form 175 and any 
modifications; otherwise, the 
application or changes to the 
application will not be received or 
reviewed by Commission staff. 
Additional information about accessing, 
completing, and viewing the FCC Form 
175 is provided in the FCC Form 175 
Instructions. Applicants requiring 
technical assistance should contact FCC 
Auctions Technical Support using the 
contact information provided in the 
Auction 113 Procedures Public Notice. 
In order to provide better service to the 
public, all calls to Technical Support 
are recorded.

Modifications 
1. Public Notice of Applicants’ Initial 
Application Status and Opportunity for 
Minor Modifications 
After the deadline for filing auction 
applications, the Commission will 
process all timely submitted 
applications to determine whether each 
applicant has complied with the 
application requirements and provided 
all information concerning its 
qualifications for bidding. OEA will 
issue a public notice with applicants’ 
initial application status, identifying: (1) 
those that are complete; and (2) those 
that are incomplete or deficient because 
of defects that may be corrected. The 
public notice will include the deadline 
for resubmitting corrected applications 
and an electronic copy will be sent by 
email to the contact address listed in the 
FCC Form 175 for each applicant. In 
addition, each applicant with an 
incomplete application will be sent 
information on the nature of the 
deficiencies in its application, along 
with the name and contact information 
of a Commission staff member who can 
answer questions specific to the 
application. 
After the initial application filing 
deadline on February 11, 2026, 
applicants can make only minor 
modifications to their applications. 
Minor amendments include any changes 
that are not major, such as: the deletion 
or addition of authorized bidders (to a 
maximum of three); revision of 
addresses and telephone numbers of the 
applicant, its responsible party, and its 
contact person; correcting typographical 
errors; and supplying or correcting 
information as requested to support the 
certifications made in the application. 
Major modifications (e.g., change of license selection, change in ownership 
that would constitute an assignment or 
transfer of control of the applicant, 
change in the required certifications, 
change in applicant’s legal classification 
that results in a change in control, or 
change in claimed eligibility for a higher 
percentage of bidding credit) will not be 
permitted. If an amendment reporting 
changes is a ‘‘major amendment,’’ as 
described in 47 CFR 1.2105(b)(2), the 
major amendment will not be accepted 
and may result in the dismissal of the 
application. After the deadline for 
resubmitting corrected applications, an 
applicant will have no further 
opportunity to cure any deficiencies in 
its application or provide any additional 
information that may affect Commission 
staff’s ultimate determination of 
whether and to what extent the 
applicant is qualified to participate in 
Auction 113 and whether the applicant 
may be eligible to pursue any bidding 
credit claim. 
Commission staff will communicate 
only with an applicant’s contact person 
or certifying official, as designated on 
the applicant’s FCC Form 175, unless 
the applicant’s certifying official or 
contact person notifies Commission staff 
in writing that another representative is 
authorized to speak on the applicant’s 
behalf. Authorizations may be sent by 
email to auction113@fcc.gov. 
2. Public Notice of Applicants’ Final 
Application Status After Upfront 
Payment Deadline 
After Commission staff reviews 
resubmitted applications and upfront 
payments, OEA will release a Qualified 
Bidders Public Notice identifying 
applicants that have become qualified 
bidders for the auction. The Qualified 
Bidders Public Notice will be issued 
before bidding in the auction begins. 
Qualified bidders are those applicants 
with submitted FCC Form 175 
applications that are deemed timely 
filed and complete and that have made 
a timely and sufficient upfront payment. 
E. Upfront Payments 
In order to be eligible to bid in 
Auction 113, a sufficient upfront 
payment and a complete and accurate 
FCC Remittance Advice Form (FCC 
Form 159, Revised 2/03) must be 
submitted before 6:00 p.m. ET on April 
8, 2026. After completing its short-form 
application, an applicant will have 
access to an electronic blank version of 
the FCC Form 159. An accurate and 
complete FCC Form 159 must 
accompany each payment. Proper 
completion of this form is critical to 
ensuring correct crediting of upfront 
payments. Payers are responsible for 
ensuring that all information entered on 
the FCC Form 159, including payment 
amounts, is accurate. Instructions for 
completing FCC Form 159 for Auction 
113 are provided below. 
1. Making Upfront Payments by Wire 
Transfer for Auction 113 
All upfront payments for Auction 113 
must be transmitted by electronic wire 
transfer directly from a bank or other 
financial institution to the proper 
account at the U.S. Treasury. Wire 
transfer payments for Auction 113 must 
be received before 6:00 p.m. ET on April 
8, 2026. No other payment method is 
acceptable. To avoid untimely 
payments, applicants should discuss 
arrangements (including bank closing 
schedules and other specific bank wire 
transfer requirements, such as an in- 
person written request before a specified 
time of day) with their bankers several 
days before they plan to make the wire 
transfer, and must allow sufficient time 
for the transfer to be initiated and 
completed before the deadline. The 
following information will be needed: 
ABA Routing Number: 021030004 
Receiving Bank: TREAS NYC, 33 Liberty 
Street, New York, NY 10045 
BENEFICIARY: FCC, 45 L Street NE, 3rd 
Floor, Washington, DC 20554 
ACCOUNT NUMBER: 827000001001 
Originating Bank Information (OBI 
Field): (Skip one space between each 
information item) 
‘‘AUCTIONPAY’’ 
APPLICANT FCC REGISTRATION 
NUMBER (FRN): (use the same FRN 
as used on the applicant’s FCC Form 
159, block 21) 
PAYMENT TYPE CODE: (same as FCC 
Form 159, block 24A: ‘‘U113’’) 
Note: The beneficiary account number (BNF Account Number) is specific to the 
upfront payments for Auction 113. Do not 
use a BNF Account Number from a previous 
auction. 
At least one hour before placing the 
order for the wire transfer (but on the 
same business day), applicants must 
print and fax a completed FCC Form 
159 (Revised 2/03) to the FCC at (202) 
418–2843. Alternatively, the completed 
form can be scanned and sent as an 
attachment to an email to 
RROGWireFaxes@fcc.gov. On the fax cover sheet or in the email subject 
header, write ‘‘Wire Transfer—Auction 
Payment for Auction 113.’’ To meet the 
upfront payment deadline, an 
applicant’s payment must be credited to 
the Commission’s account for Auction 
113 before the deadline. 
Each applicant is responsible for 
ensuring the timely submission of its 
upfront payment and for timely filing an 
accurate and complete FCC Form 159. 
An applicant should coordinate with its 
financial institution well ahead of the 
due date regarding its wire transfer and 
allow sufficient time for the transfer to 
be initiated and completed prior to the 
deadline. The Commission repeatedly 
has cautioned auction participants 
about the importance of planning ahead 
to prepare for unforeseen last-minute 
difficulties in making payments by wire 
transfer. Each applicant also is 
responsible for obtaining confirmation 
from its financial institution that its 
wire transfer to the U.S. Treasury was 
successful and from Commission staff 
that its upfront payment was timely 
received and that it was deposited into 
the proper account. As a regulatory 
requirement, the U.S. Treasury screens 
all payments from all financial 
institutions before deposits are made 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59986 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations available to specified accounts. If wires 
are suspended, the U.S. Treasury may 
direct questions regarding any transfer 
to the financial institution initiating the 
wire. Each applicant must take care to 
assure that any questions directed to its 
financial institution(s) are addressed 
promptly. To receive confirmation from 
Commission staff, contact Scott 
Radcliffe of the Office of Managing 
Director’s Revenue & Receivables 
Operations Group/Auctions at (202) 
418–7518 or Theresa Meeks at (202) 
418–2945. 
Please note the following information 
regarding upfront payments: 
€All payments must be made in U.S. dollars. 
€All payments must be made by wire transfer. 
€Upfront payments for Auction 113 go to an account number different from 
the accounts used in previous FCC 
auctions. 
Failure to deliver a sufficient upfront 
payment as instructed herein by the 
upfront payment deadline will result in 
dismissal of the short-form application 
and disqualification from participation 
in the auction. 
2. Completing and Submitting FCC 
Form 159 
The following information 
supplements the standard instructions 
for FCC Form 159 (Revised 2/03) and is 
provided to help ensure the correct 
completion of FCC Form 159 for upfront 
payments for Auction 113. Applicants 
need to complete FCC Form 159 
carefully because: 
€Mistakes may affect bidding eligibility; and 
€Lack of consistency between information provided in FCC Form 159 
(Revised 2/03), FCC Form 175, long- 
form application (FCC Form 601), and 
correspondence about an application 
may cause processing delays. 
Therefore, appropriate cross- 
references between the FCC Form 159 
Remittance Advice and the short-form 
application (FCC Form 175) are 
described in the following chart: 
Block No. Required information 1 .................. LOCKBOX #—Leave Blank. 
2 .................. Payer Name—Enter the name of the person or company making the payment. If the applicant itself is the payer, this entry would 
be the same name as in FCC Form 175. 
3 .................. Total Amount Paid—Enter the amount of the upfront payment associated with the FCC Form 159 (Revised 2/03). 
4–8 .............. Street Address, City, State, ZIP Code—Enter the street mailing address (not post office box number) where mail should be sent 
to the payer. If the applicant is the payer, these entries would be the same as FCC Form 175 from the Applicant Information 
section. 
9 .................. Daytime Telephone Number—Enter the telephone number of a person knowledgeable about this upfront payment. 
10 ................ Country Code—For addresses outside the United States, enter the appropriate postal country code (available from the Mailing 
Requirements Department of the U.S. Postal Service). 
11 ................ Payer FRN—Enter the payer’s 10-digit FCC Registration Number (FRN) registered in the Commission Registration System (CORES). 
21 ................ Applicant FRN (Complete only if applicant is different than payer)—Enter the applicant’s 10-digit FRN registered in CORES. 
24A .............. Payment Type Code—Enter ‘‘U113’’. 
25A .............. Quantity—Enter the number ‘‘1’’. 
26A .............. Fee Due—Amount of Upfront Payment. 
27A .............. Total Fee—Will be the same amount as 26A. 
28A .............. FCC Code 1—Enter the number ‘‘113’’ (indicating Auction 113). 
Notes: 
€Do not use Remittance Advice (Continuation Sheet), FCC Form 159–C, for 
upfront payments. 
€If the applicant is different from the payer, complete blocks 13 through 21 for the 
applicant, using the same information shown 
on FCC Form 175. Otherwise leave them 
blank. 
€No signature is required on FCC Form 159 for auction payments. 
€Since credit card payments will not be accepted for upfront payments for an auction, 
leave Section E blank. 
3. Upfront Payments and Bidding 
Eligibility 
An upfront payment is a refundable 
deposit made by each applicant seeking 
to participate in bidding to establish its 
eligibility to bid on licenses. Upfront 
payments that are related to the 
inventory of licenses being auctioned 
protect against frivolous or insincere 
bidding and provide the Commission 
with a source of funds from which to 
collect payments owed at the close of 
bidding. 
Applicants that are former defaulters 
must pay upfront payments 50% greater 
than non-former defaulters. For 
purposes of classification as a former 
defaulter or a former delinquent, 
defaults and delinquencies of the 
applicant itself and its controlling 
interests are included. 
An applicant must make an upfront 
payment sufficient to obtain bidding 
eligibility on the licenses on which it 
will bid. OEA and WTB adopt the 
proposals in the Auction 113 Comment 
Public Notice to set upfront payments 
based on the MHz-pops of each license 
offered in the auction and to determine 
an applicant’s initial bidding eligibility, 
the maximum number of bidding units 
on which a bidder may place bids in 
any single round, based on the amount 
of the upfront payment. In order to bid 
for a license, qualified bidders must 
have a current eligibility level that 
meets or exceeds the number of bidding 
units assigned to that license. At a 
minimum, therefore, an applicant’s total 
upfront payment must be enough to 
establish eligibility to bid on at least one 
license in a market selected on its FCC 
Form 175 for Auction 113, or else the 
applicant will not become qualified to 
participate in the auction. The total 
upfront payment does not affect the 
total dollar amount the bidder may bid. 
The Commission has authority to 
determine appropriate upfront 
payments for each license being 
auctioned, taking into account such 
factors as the efficiency of the auction 
process and the potential value of 
similar licenses. In the Auction 113 
Comment Public Notice, OEA and WTB 
proposed to base upfront payments for 
the paired licenses on dollars per MHz- 
pop in three population tiers: $0.005 per 
MHz-pop for the paired licenses in areas 
with a population of less than 300,000, 
$0.01 per MHz-pop for the paired 
licenses in areas with a population of at 
least 300,000 and less than 1,000,000, 
$0.025 per MHz-pop for the paired 
licenses in areas with a population of at 
least 1,000,000, and $0.005 per MHz- 
pop for the unpaired licenses and 
sought comment on this proposal. OEA 
and WTB received no comment on this 
proposal. OEA and WTB believe that 
this methodology is appropriate here 
and therefore adopt it. For all licenses, 
upfront payments will be subject to a 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59987 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations minimum of $500 per license. The 
upfront payment amount per license is 
set forth in the Attachment A file on the 
Auction 113 website at www.fcc.gov/ 
auction/113. 
Additionally, for the reasons set forth 
in the Auction 113 Comment Public 
Notice, OEA and WTB adopt the proposal to assign each license a 
specific number of bidding units, equal 
to one bidding unit per $100 of the 
upfront payment, which is necessary for 
implementing the activity requirement 
described in the Auction 113 Procedures 
Public Notice, and facilitates the 
efficient conduct of the auction. The 
number of bidding units for a given 
license is fixed and does not change 
during the auction as prices change. 
Thus, in calculating its upfront payment 
amount, an applicant should determine 
the maximum number of bidding units 
on which it may wish to bid in any 
single round, and submit an upfront 
payment amount covering that number 
of bidding units. In order to make this 
calculation, an applicant should add 
together the bidding units for the 
licenses on which it seeks to be active 
in any given round. Applicants should 
check their calculations carefully, as 
there is no provision for increasing a 
bidder’s eligibility after the upfront 
payment deadline. 
EXAMPLE—UPFRONTPAYMENTS ANDBIDDINGELIGIBILITY 
License Description Bidding units  Upfront payment CMA117–G ................................................................ Colorado Springs, CO ............................................... 760 $76,000 CMA118–G ................................................................ Reading, PA ..............................................................430 43,000 Under the clock-1 format, if a bidder wishes to bid on both of the above licenses in a round, it must have selected both of the markets in which 
each of these licenses are located on its FCC Form 175 and have purchased at least 1,190 bidding units (760 + 430) of bidding eligibility. If a 
bidder only wishes to bid on one license, but not both, purchasing 760 bidding units would allow the bidder to bid on either license, but not both 
at the same time. If the bidder purchased only 430 bidding units, the bidder would have enough eligibility to bid for the license in Reading but not 
for the one in Colorado Springs. 
If an applicant is a former defaulter, 
it must calculate its upfront payment for 
the maximum number of licenses on 
which it plans to bid by multiplying the 
number of bidding units on which it 
wishes to be active by 1.5. In order to 
calculate the number of bidding units to 
assign to former defaulters, the 
Commission will calculate the number 
of bidding units a non-former defaulter 
would get for the upfront payment 
received, divide that number by 1.5, and 
round the result up to the nearest 
bidding unit. If a former defaulter fails 
to submit a sufficient upfront payment 
to establish eligibility to bid on at least 
one license, the applicant will not be 
eligible to bid in Auction 113. 
F. Auction Registration 
All qualified bidders for Auction 113 
are automatically registered for the 
auction. Registration materials will be 
distributed prior to the auction by 
overnight delivery. The mailing will be 
sent only to the contact person at the 
contact address listed in the FCC Form 
175 and will include the SecurID

 
tokens that will be required to place 
bids. 
Qualified bidders that do not receive 
this registration mailing will not be able 
to submit bids. Therefore, any qualified 
bidder for Auction 113 that has not 
received this mailing by noon on May 
15, 2026, should call the Auctions 
Hotline at (717) 338–2868. Receipt of 
this registration mailing is critical to 
participating in the auction, and each 
applicant is responsible for ensuring it 
has received all the registration 
materials. 
In the event that a SecurID

token is 
lost or damaged, only a person who has 
been designated as an authorized 
bidder, the contact person, or the 
certifying official on the applicant’s 
short-form application may request a 
replacement. To request a replacement, 
call the Auction Bidder Line at the 
telephone number provided in the 
registration materials or the Auction 
Hotline at (717) 338–2868. 
G. Remote Electronic Bidding Via the 
Bidding System 
Bidders will be able to participate in 
Auction 113 over the internet using the 
bidding system. In addition, bidders 
will have the option of placing bids by 
telephone through a dedicated auction 
bidder line. Please note that telephonic 
bid assistants are required to use a script 
when entering bids placed by telephone. 
Telephonic bidders are therefore 
reminded to allow sufficient time to bid 
by placing their calls well in advance of 
the close of a round. The length of a call 
to place a telephonic bid may vary; 
please allow a minimum of 10 minutes. 
The toll-free telephone number for the 
auction bidder line will be provided to 
qualified bidders prior to the start of 
bidding in the auction. 
Only qualified bidders are permitted 
to bid. Each authorized bidder must 
have his or her own SecurID

token, 
which the Commission will provide at 
no charge. Each applicant will be issued 
three SecurID

tokens. A bidder cannot 
bid without his or her SecurID

token. 
In order to access the bidding function 
of the bidding system, bidders must be 
logged in during the bidding round 
using the passcode generated by the 
SecurID

token and a personal 
identification number (PIN) created by 
the bidder. For security purposes, the 
SecurID

tokens and a telephone 
number for bidding questions are only 
mailed to the contact person at the 
contact address listed on the FCC Form 
175. Each SecurID

token is tailored to 
a specific auction. SecurID

tokens 
issued for other auctions or obtained 
from a source other than the FCC will 
not work for Auction 113. Please note 
that the SecurID

tokens can be 
recycled, and the Commission requests 
that bidders return the tokens to the 
FCC. Pre-addressed envelopes will be 
provided to return the tokens once the 
auction has ended. 
The Commission makes no warranties 
whatsoever and shall not be deemed to 
have made any warranties, with respect 
to the bidding system, including any 
implied warranties of merchantability or 
fitness for a particular purpose. In no 
event shall the Commission, or any of 
its officers, employees, or agents, be 
liable for any damages whatsoever 
(including, but not limited to, loss of 
business profits, business interruption, 
loss of use, revenue, or business 
information, or any other direct, 
indirect, or consequential damages) 
arising out of or relating to the 
existence, furnishing, functioning, or 
use of the bidding system. Moreover, no 
obligation or liability will arise out of 
the Commission’s technical, 
programming, or other advice or service 
provided in connection with the 
bidding system. 
To the extent an issue arises with the 
bidding system itself, the Commission 
will take all appropriate measures to 
resolve such issues quickly and 
equitably. Should an issue arise that is 
outside the bidding system or 
attributable to a bidder, including, but

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59988 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations not limited to, a bidder’s hardware, 
software, or internet access problem that 
prevents the bidder from submitting a 
bid prior to the end of a round, the 
Commission shall have no obligation to 
resolve or remediate such an issue on 
behalf of the bidder. Similarly, if an 
issue arises due to bidder error using the 
bidding system, the Commission shall 
have no obligation to resolve or 
remediate such an issue on behalf of the 
bidder. Accordingly, after the close of a 
bidding round, the results of bid 
processing will not be altered absent 
evidence of any failure in the bidding 
system. 
H. Mock Auction 
All qualified bidders will be eligible 
to participate in a mock auction. The 
mock auction, which will begin on May 
29, 2026, will enable qualified bidders 
to become familiar with the bidding 
system and to practice submitting bids 
prior to the auction. OEA and WTB 
recommend that all qualified bidders, 
including all their authorized bidders, 
participate to assure that they can log in 
to the bidding system and gain 
experience with the bidding procedures. 
Participating in the mock auction may 
reduce the likelihood of a bidder 
making a mistake during the auction. 
Details regarding the mock auction will 
be announced in the Qualified Bidders 
Public Notice for Auction 113. 
I. Fraud Alert 
As is the case with many business 
investment opportunities, some 
unscrupulous parties may attempt to 
use Auction 113 to deceive and defraud 
unsuspecting investors. Common 
warning signals of fraud include the 
following: 
€The first contact is a ‘‘cold call’’ from a telemarketer or is made in 
response to an inquiry prompted by a 
radio or television infomercial. 
€The offering materials used to invest in the venture appear to be 
targeted at IRA funds, for example, by 
including all documents and papers 
needed for the transfer of funds 
maintained in IRA accounts. 
€The amount of investment is less than $25,000. 
€The sales representative makes verbal representations that: (a) the 
Internal Revenue Service, Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC), Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC), FCC, or 
other government agency has approved 
the investment; (b) the investment is not 
subject to state or federal securities 
laws; or (c) the investment will yield 
unrealistically high short-term profits. 
In addition, the offering materials often 
include copies of actual FCC releases, or 
quotes from FCC personnel, giving the 
appearance of FCC knowledge or 
approval of the solicitation. 
Information about deceptive 
telemarketing investment schemes is 
available from the FCC, as well as the 
FTC and SEC. Additional sources of 
information for potential bidders and 
investors may be obtained from the 
following sources: 
€the FCC’s Consumer Call Center at (888) 225–5322 or by visiting

Fraud Center at https://fraud.org/ or (202) 835–3323, Ext. 815. 
III. Short-Form Application Contents 
and Certifications 
A. General Information Regarding 
Short-Form Applications 
An application to participate in 
Auction 113, referred to as a short-form 
application or FCC Form 175, provides 
information concerning the applicant’s 
legal, technical, and/or financial 
qualifications to participate in a 
Commission auction for spectrum 
licenses or permits. The short-form 
application is the first part of the 
Commission’s two-phased auction 
application process. In the first phase, a 
party seeking to participate in Auction 
113 must file a short-form application in 
which it certifies, under penalty of 
perjury, that it is qualified to 
participate. Eligibility to participate in 
Auction 113 is determined based on an 
applicant’s short-form application and 
certifications and on the applicant’s 
upfront payment. Pursuant to 47 CFR 
1.2105, each applicant must make a 
series of certifications under penalty of 
perjury on its FCC Form 175 related to 
the information provided in its 
application and its participation in the 
auction, and it must confirm that it is 
legally, technically, financially, and 
otherwise qualified to hold a 
Commission license. An auction 
applicant’s failure to make the required 
certifications in its short-form 
application by the applicable filing 
deadline would render its application 
unacceptable for filing, its application 
would be dismissed with prejudice, and 
it would be ineligible to participate 
further in the auction. One commenter 
requests that the Commission ‘‘develop 
and mandate a Certification of Tribal 
Spectrum Access for all licensees.’’ No 
parties commented on this request, and 
the request is outside the scope of 
OEA’s and WTB’s delegated authority. 
After bidding closes, in the second 
phase of the process, each winning 
bidder in Auction 113 must file a more 
comprehensive post-auction long-form 
application (FCC Form 601) for the 
licenses it wins in the auction, and it 
must have a complete and accurate 
ownership disclosure information report 
(FCC Form 602) on file with the 
Commission. OEA and WTB remind 
applicants that being deemed qualified 
to bid in Auction 113 does not 
constitute a determination that a party 
is qualified to hold a Commission 
license or is eligible for a designated 
entity bidding credit. 
A party seeking to participate in 
Auction 113 must file an FCC Form 175 
electronically via the Auction 
Application Portal (AAP) in the AAS 
prior to 6:00 p.m. ET on February 11, 
2026, following the procedures 
prescribed in the FCC Form 175 
Instructions. In order to access the AAP 
within the AAS to create a new auction 
application for an applicant, or save, 
edit, view, and/or withdraw an existing 
application for the applicant, an 
individual must: (1) have a unique 
email address associated with an FCC 
Username account that is associated 
with the applicant’s FCC Registration 
Number (FRN) in the Commission 
Registration System (CORES), (2) be 
granted the appropriate permissions in 
CORES by an Administrator of that 
FRN, and (3) be assigned the 
appropriate Auctions Permissions in the 
AAP by the Administrator of that FRN. 
The AAS includes security features that 
are being implemented for the first time 
in Auction 113, including the use of 
multifactor authentication. The 
Commission expects to make the AAS 
available to the public for the 
Administrator(s) for an FRN to assign 
the appropriate Auctions Permissions in 
the AAP to each unique FCC Username 
associated with that FRN on January 7, 
2026. 
An Auction 113 applicant bears full 
responsibility for submitting an 
accurate, complete, and timely short- 
form application. Pursuant to the 
Commission’s competitive bidding 
rules, an applicant must make a series 
of certifications under penalty of perjury 
on its FCC Form 175 related to the 
information provided in its application 
and its participation in the auction, and 
an applicant must confirm that it is 
legally, technically, financially, and 
otherwise qualified to hold a license. If 
an applicant claims eligibility for a

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59989 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations bidding credit, then the information 
provided in its FCC Form 175 will be 
used to determine whether the applicant 
appears to be eligible for the claimed 
bidding credit, with the final 
determination of bidding credit 
eligibility to occur based on a winning 
bidder’s post-auction long-form 
application. Each participant in Auction 
113 must also certify that it has read the 
Auction 113 Procedures Public Notice 
and familiarized itself both with the 
auction procedures and with the 
requirements for obtaining a license and 
operating facilities in the AWS–3 bands. 
If an Auction 113 applicant fails to 
make the required certifications in its 
FCC Form 175 by the filing deadline, 
then its application will be deemed 
unacceptable for filing and cannot be 
corrected after the filing deadline. 
An applicant should note that 
submitting an FCC Form 175 (and any 
amendments thereto) constitutes a 
representation by the certifying official 
that he or she is an authorized 
representative of the applicant with 
authority to bind the applicant, that he 
or she has read the form’s instructions 
and certifications, and that the contents 
of the application, its certifications, and 
any attachments are true and correct. 
Submitting a false certification to the 
Commission may result in penalties, 
including monetary forfeitures, license 
forfeitures, ineligibility to participate in 
future auctions, and/or criminal 
prosecution. 
Applicants are cautioned that, 
because the required information 
submitted in FCC Form 175 bears on 
each applicant’s qualifications, requests 
for confidential treatment will not be 
routinely granted. The Commission 
generally has held that it may publicly 
release confidential business 
information where the party has put that 
information at issue in a Commission 
proceeding or where the Commission 
has identified a compelling public 
interest in disclosing the information. In 
this regard, OEA and WTB have 
previously concluded that information 
submitted in support of receiving 
bidding credits in auction proceedings 
should be made available to the public. 
An applicant must designate between 
one and three individuals as authorized 
bidders in its FCC Form 175. The 
Commission’s rules prohibit an 
individual from serving as an 
authorized bidder for more than one 
auction applicant. 
To access the bidding system, each 
authorized bidder will be required to 
have a unique email address associated 
with an FCC Username account that is 
associated with the applicant’s FRN in 
CORES. The email address associated 
with an FCC Username account is also 
the FCC Username for that account. If an 
authorized bidder does not provide an 
FCC Username that is associated with 
the applicant’s FRN in the applicant’s 
FCC Form 175, that bidder will be 
unable to place or submit bids. For 
further details, applicants should refer 
to the FCC Form 175 Instructions for 
Auction 113. 
No individual or entity may file more 
than one short-form application or have 
a controlling interest in more than one 
short-form application. If a party 
submits multiple short-form 
applications for an auction, then only 
one application may form the basis for 
that party to become qualified to bid in 
that auction. 
Similarly, and consistent with the 
Commission’s general prohibition on 
joint bidding agreements, a party 
generally is permitted to participate in 
a Commission auction only through a 
single bidding entity. Accordingly, the 
filing of applications in Auction 113 by 
multiple entities controlled by the same 
individual or set of individuals 
generally will not be permitted. As 
noted by the Commission in adopting 
the prohibition on applications by 
commonly controlled entities, this rule, 
in conjunction with the prohibition 
against joint bidding agreements, 
protects the competitiveness of the 
Commission’s auctions. 
After the initial short-form 
application filing deadline, Commission 
staff will review each timely submitted 
application to determine whether it 
complies with the application 
requirements. Following this review, a 
public notice will be released 
announcing the status of the submitted 
applications and establishing an 
application resubmission filing window, 
during which an applicant may make 
minor modifications to its application to 
address identified deficiencies. To 
become a qualified bidder, an applicant 
must have a complete application (i.e., 
have timely filed an application that is 
deemed complete after the deadline for 
correcting any identified deficiencies) 
and make a timely and sufficient 
upfront payment. Qualified bidders will 
be identified by public notice at least 10 
days prior to the mock auction. 
The Auction 113 Procedures Public Notice provides details regarding certain information required to be submitted in 
the FCC Form 175, however, an 
applicant should consult the 
Commission’s rules to ensure that, in 
addition to the materials described in 
the Auction 113 Procedures Public Notice, all required information is included in its short-form application. 
To the extent the information in the 
Auction 113 Procedures Public Notice 
does not address an applicant’s specific 
operating structure, or if the applicant 
needs additional information or 
guidance concerning the described 
disclosure requirements, the applicant 
should review the educational materials 
for Auction 113 (see the Education 
section on the Auction 113 website at 
www.fcc.gov/auction/113) and use the 
contact information provided in the 
Auction 113 Procedures Public Notice to 
consult with Commission staff to better 
understand the information that it must 
submit in its short-form application. 
B. Certification of Notice of Auction 113 
Requirements and Procedures 
For the reasons set forth in the 
Auction 113 Comment Public Notice, 
OEA and WTB adopt the proposal to 
require any applicant seeking to 
participate in Auction 113 to certify in 
its short-form application, under 
penalty of perjury, that it has read the 
Auction 113 Procedures Public Notice 
adopting procedures for Auction 113 
and that it has familiarized itself with 
these procedures and with the 
requirements for obtaining a license and 
operating facilities in the AWS–3 bands. 
This certification is designed to 
bolster applicants’ efforts to educate 
themselves about the procedures for 
auction participation and to ensure that, 
prior to submitting their short-form 
applications, applicants understand 
their obligation to stay abreast of 
relevant information. Familiarity with 
the Commission’s rules and procedures 
governing Auction 113 may also help 
bidders avoid the consequences to them 
associated with defaults, which also 
cause harm to other applicants and the 
public by reducing the efficiency of the 
auction process and reducing the 
likelihood that the license will be 
assigned to the bidder that values it the 
most. This certification, along with the 
other certifications required pursuant to 
47 CFR 1.2105(a), will promote the 
submission of applications that meet the 
Commission’s requirements, thereby 
leading to a more efficient application 
process. 
A substantively similar requirement 
was instituted for Auctions 110, 108, 
and 112. This requirement furthers a 
long-standing policy under which the 
Commission expressly places a burden 
upon each applicant to be thoroughly 
familiar with the procedures, terms, and 
conditions contained in the relevant 
Procedures Public Notice and any future 
public notices that may be released in 
the auction proceeding. While the 
certification OEA and WTB add refers to 
information regarding auction 
procedures and licensing that is 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59990 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations available at the time of certification, 
potential auction applicants are on 
notice from the Auction 113 Procedures 
Public Notice that their educational 
efforts must continue even after their 
short-form applications are filed. 
Commission staff routinely makes 
available detailed educational materials, 
such as interactive, online tutorials and 
technical guides, to enhance interested 
parties’ comprehension of the pre- 
bidding and bidding processes and to 
help applicants minimize their need to 
engage outside engineers, legal counsel, 
or other auction experts. 
For these reasons, OEA and WTB will 
require each Auction 113 applicant to 
certify as follows in its short-form 
application: 
that the applicant has read the public notice 
adopting procedures for the auction and that 
it has familiarized itself both with the 
auction procedures and with the 
requirements for obtaining a license and 
operating facilities in the AWS–3 bands. 
An applicant must provide this 
certification under penalty of perjury, 
consistent with 47 CFR 1.2105(a). This 
certification must be provided in 
addition to the certifications already 
required under 47 CFR 1.2105. As with 
the other certifications required in the 
short-form application, an applicant’s 
failure to make this certification in its 
FCC Form 175 by the February 11, 2026 
short-form filing deadline will render its 
application unacceptable for filing, and 
its application will be dismissed with 
prejudice. 
C. Acknowledgement Statement for 
Auction 113 Applicants 
OEA and WTB adopt their proposal to 
require each applicant that selects on its 
short-form application any market in 
which there is a license in the 1755– 
1780 MHz band available for bidding to 
submit as an attachment to its short- 
form application a signed statement 
acknowledging that the applicant’s 
operations in the 1755–1780 MHz band 
may be subject to interference from 
Federal systems, that the applicant must 
accept interference from incumbent 
Federal operations, and that the 
applicant has considered these risks 
before submitting any bids for 
applicable licenses in Auction 113. The 
specific text that must be included in 
the required acknowledgement 
statement is contained in Attachment B 
to the Auction 113 Procedures Public 
Notice. The acknowledgement statement must be signed by the same individual 
that signs the application on behalf of 
the applicant. 
D. License Selection 
Auction 113 will offer 200 licenses in 
199 markets. An applicant must select 
all of the markets in which it may want 
to bid from the list of available markets 
on its FCC Form 175. One market, 
EA173, has two licenses available (one 
in frequency block H and one in 
frequency block I). An applicant that 
wishes to bid on either license in that 
market must select the market (and will 
be therefore eligible to bid on both 
licenses, assuming that it otherwise has 
sufficient bidding eligibility), even if it 
intends to bid on only one license and 
not the other. An applicant must 
carefully review and verify its selections 
before the FCC Form 175 filing deadline 
because those selections cannot be 
changed after the auction application 
filing deadline. An applicant is not 
required to place bids on any of the 
licenses in the markets it selects, but the 
bidding system will not accept bids for 
license(s) in a market that the applicant 
did not select in its FCC Form 175. 
When two or more short-form 
applications are submitted selecting the 
same market in Auction 113, mutual 
exclusivity exists for auction purposes 
as to the license(s) in that market, and 
those license(s) must be awarded by 
competitive bidding procedures. Once 
mutual exclusivity exists for auction 
purposes, even if only one applicant is 
qualified to bid for a particular license, 
that applicant is required to submit a 
bid in order to obtain the license. 
E. Disclosure of Agreements and 
Bidding Arrangements 
An applicant must provide in its FCC 
Form 175 a brief description of, and 
identify each party to, any partnerships, 
joint ventures, consortia or other 
agreements, arrangements, or 
understandings of any kind relating to 
the licenses being auctioned, including 
any agreements that address or 
communicate directly or indirectly bids 
(including specific prices), bidding 
strategies (including the specific 
licenses on which to bid or not to bid), 
or the post-auction market structure, to 
which the applicant, or any party that 
controls or is controlled by the 
applicant, is a party. In connection with 
the agreement disclosure requirement, 
the applicant must certify under penalty 
of perjury in its FCC Form 175 that it 
has described, and identified each party 
to any such agreements, arrangements, 
or understandings to which it (or any 
party that controls it or that it controls) 
is a party. Moreover, since each 
applicant must maintain the accuracy 
and completeness of the information in 
its pending auction application, if it 
enters into any agreement relating to the 
licenses being auctioned after the FCC 
Form 175 filing deadline, then that 
agreement is subject to these same 
disclosure requirements. 
For purposes of making the required 
agreement disclosures on the FCC Form 
175, if parties agree in principle on all 
material terms prior to the application 
filing deadline, then each party to the 
agreement that is submitting an auction 
application must provide a brief 
description of, and identify the other 
party or parties to, the agreement on its 
respective FCC Form 175, even if the 
agreement has not been reduced to 
writing. Parties that have not agreed in 
principle by the FCC Form 175 filing 
deadline should not describe, or include 
the names of parties to, the discussions 
on their applications. 
The Commission’s rules generally 
prohibit joint bidding and other 
arrangements involving auction 
applicants (including any party that 
controls or is controlled by such 
applicants). For purposes of the 
prohibition, a joint bidding arrangement 
includes any arrangement relating to the 
licenses being auctioned that addresses 
or communicates, directly or indirectly, 
bidding in the auction, bidding 
strategies, including arrangements 
regarding price or the specific licenses 
on which to bid, and any such 
arrangement relating to the post-auction 
market structure. 
This prohibition applies to joint 
bidding arrangements involving two or 
more nationwide providers, as well as 
joint bidding arrangements involving a 
nationwide provider and one or more 
non-nationwide providers, where at 
least one party to the arrangement is an 
applicant for the auction. In the 
Updating Part 1 Report and Order, 80 
FR 56764 (September 18, 2015), the 
Commission stated that entities that 
qualify as nationwide providers 
generally would be identified in 
procedures public notices released 
before each auction. To that end, in the 
Auction 113 Comment Public Notice, 
OEA and WTB proposed to identify 
AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon as 
‘‘nationwide providers’’ for the purpose 
of implementing the competitive 
bidding rules in Auction 113, including 
47 CFR 1.2105(c), the rule prohibiting 
certain communications, which is 
consistent with the Commission’s 
decisions in recent spectrum auctions 
and the 2024 Communications 
Marketplace Report, FCC 24–136 
(released December 31, 2024). 
One commenter requests that OEA 
and WTB also identify EchoStar 
Corporation (EchoStar), or any bidders 
‘‘with whom EchoStar has agreements,’’ 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59991 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations as a ‘‘nationwide provider’’ for purposes 
of Auction 113, citing the public 
statements made by DISH Network 
(DISH) and EchoStar that have referred 
to DISH’s ‘‘nationwide 5G network’’ and 
because EchoStar’s Boost Mobile 
Network touts 99% coverage. OEA and 
WTB decline to adopt this suggestion 
for Auction 113. The Commission has 
historically relied, in part, on the 
Communications Marketplace Report 
among its justifications for a 
determination of which entities are 
considered to be ‘‘nationwide 
providers’’ for competitive bidding 
purposes, and the Commission’s most 
recent report, released in December 
2024, did not identify EchoStar as a 
nationwide provider. In addition, 
EchoStar’s geographic coverage as 
reflected on the Commission’s National 
Broadband Map, is substantially less 
than that of AT&T, T-Mobile, and 
Verizon. Moreover, EchoStar’s Boost 
Mobile is partially a Mobile Virtual 
Network Operator (MVNO), and its 
purported ‘‘99%’’ coverage that this 
commenter refers to is based in part on 
the nationwide networks of its 
wholesale providers (e.g., AT&T and T- Mobile). OEA and WTB therefore adopt 
their proposal to identify only AT&T, T- 
Mobile, and Verizon as ‘‘nationwide 
providers’’ for purposes of 
implementing the competitive bidding 
rules in Auction 113. 
Under certain circumstances, a non- 
nationwide provider may enter into an 
agreement to form a consortium or a 
joint venture (as applicable) that results 
in a single party applying to participate 
in an auction. Specifically, a designated 
entity can participate in one consortium 
or joint venture in an auction, and non- 
nationwide providers that are not 
designated entities may participate in an 
auction through only one joint venture. 
A non-nationwide provider may enter 
into only one agreement to form a 
consortium or joint venture (as 
applicable), and such consortium or 
joint venture shall be the exclusive 
bidding vehicle for its members in the 
auction. The general prohibition on 
joint bidding arrangements excludes 
certain agreements, including those that 
are solely operational in nature, as 
defined in 47 CFR 1.2105(a)(2)(ix)(A)– 
(C). 
To implement the prohibition on joint 
bidding arrangements, the 
Commission’s rules require each 
applicant to certify in its short-form 
application that it has disclosed any 
arrangements or understandings of any 
kind relating to the licenses being 
auctioned to which it (or any party that 
controls or is controlled by it) is a party. 
The applicant must also certify that it 
(or any party that controls or is 
controlled by it) has not entered and 
will not enter into any arrangement or 
understanding of any kind relating 
directly or indirectly to bidding at 
auction with, among others, any other 
applicant or a nationwide provider. 
Although the Commission’s rules do 
not prohibit auction applicants from 
communicating about matters that are 
within the scope of an excepted 
agreement that has been disclosed in an 
FCC Form 175, OEA and WTB remind 
applicants that certain discussions or 
exchanges could nonetheless touch 
upon impermissible subject matters, and 
that compliance with the Commission’s 
rules will not insulate a party from 
enforcement of the antitrust laws. 
Applicants should bear in mind that 
a winning bidder will be required to 
disclose in its post-auction long-form 
application, the specific terms, 
conditions, and parties involved in any 
agreement relating to the licenses being 
auctioned into which it had entered 
prior to the time bidding was 
completed. This applies to any bidding 
consortium, joint venture, partnership, 
or other agreement, arrangement, or 
understanding of any kind entered into 
relating to the competitive bidding 
process, including any agreements 
relating to the licenses being auctioned 
that address or communicate directly or 
indirectly bids (including specific 
prices), bidding strategies (including the 
specific licenses on which to bid or not 
to bid), or the post-auction market 
structure, to which the applicant, or any 
party that controls or is controlled by 
the applicant, is a party. 
F. Ownership Disclosure Requirements 
Each applicant must comply with the 
applicable part 1 ownership disclosure 
requirements and provide information 
required by 47 CFR 1.2105 and 1.2112, 
and, when applicable, 47 CFR 1.2110. 
Specifically, in completing FCC Form 
175, an applicant must fully disclose 
information regarding the real party- or 
parties-in-interest in the applicant or 
application and the ownership structure 
of the applicant, including both direct 
and indirect ownership interests of 10% 
or more, as prescribed in 47 CFR 1.2105 
and 1.2112 and, where applicable, 47 
CFR 1.2110. Each applicant is 
responsible for ensuring that 
information submitted in its short-form 
application is complete and accurate. 
In certain circumstances, an applicant 
may have previously filed an FCC Form 
602 ownership disclosure information 
report or filed an application to 
participate in a previous auction in 
which ownership information was 
disclosed. If in that previous filing, the 
applicant used the same FRN the 
applicant is using to create its FCC Form 
175 for Auction 113, the applicant will 
have the option to pre-fill the most 
current ownership information 
contained in any such filing into certain 
ownership sections on the applicant’s 
FCC Form 175, if such information is in 
an electronic format compatible with 
FCC Form 175. Applicants who want to 
take advantage of the pre-fill option are 
encouraged to submit an FCC Form 602 
ownership report or update any 
ownership information on file with the 
Commission in an FCC Form 602 
ownership report prior to starting a 
short-form application for Auction 113 
to ensure that their most recent 
ownership information is pre-filled into 
their short-form application. Each 
applicant must carefully review any 
ownership information that has been 
pre-filled into its FCC Form 175, 
including any ownership attachments, 
to confirm that all information supplied 
on FCC Form 175 is complete and 
accurate as of the application filing 
deadline. Any information that needs to 
be corrected or updated must be 
changed directly in FCC Form 175. 
G. Foreign Ownership Disclosure 
Requirements 
47 U.S.C. 310 requires the 
Commission to review foreign 
investment in radio station licenses and 
imposes specific restrictions on who 
may hold certain types of radio licenses. 
47 U.S.C. 310 applies to applications for 
initial radio licenses, applications for 
assignments and transfers of control of 
radio licenses, and spectrum leasing 
arrangements under the Commission’s 
secondary market rules. In completing 
FCC Form 175, an applicant is required 
to disclose information concerning 
foreign ownership of the applicant. If an 
applicant has foreign ownership 
interests in excess of the applicable 
limit or benchmark set forth in 47 U.S.C. 
310(b), then it may seek to participate in

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59992 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations H. Additional Disclosures for Small 
Businesses and Rural Service Providers 
Seeking Bidding Credits 
In Auction 113, designated entity 
bidding credits will be available to 
applicants that demonstrate eligibility 
for a small business or a rural service 
provider bidding credit and are 
subsequently winning bidders in the 
auction. A bidding credit represents an 
amount by which an eligible small 
business or rural service provider 
bidder’s overall payment across the 
licenses won may be discounted, subject 
to the specified caps on the total 
bidding credit discount they may 
receive adopted in the Auction 113 
Procedures Public Notice. These bidding 
credits will not be cumulative—an 
applicant is permitted to request either 
a small business bidding credit or a 
rural service provider bidding credit, 
but not both. 
The Commission’s rules regarding 
designated entity bidding credits 
provide for, among other things: (1) a 
two-pronged standard for evaluating 
eligibility for small business benefits, (2) 
updated gross revenue requirements for 
determining whether a small business is 
eligible for a 15% or 25% bidding 
credit, (3) a bidding credit for eligible 
rural service providers, and (4) an 
attribution rule for certain disclosable 
interest holders of applicants claiming 
eligibility for bidding credits. An 
applicant seeking a designated entity 
bidding credit must disclose in its short- 
form application additional information 
demonstrating its eligibility for that 
bidding credit, and must also certify 
that it is eligible for the bidding credit 
it requests in its FCC Form 175. 
In addition to the information 
provided in the Auction 113 Procedures 
Public Notice, each applicant should 
review carefully the Commission’s 
decisions regarding eligibility for 
designated entity benefits as well as the 
part 1 rules. In particular, OEA and 
WTB remind applicants requesting 
bidding credits that they should take 
due account of the requirements of the 
Commission’s rules and implementing 
orders regarding de jure and de facto control of such applicants. Nearly all of 
the spectrum associated with the 
licenses to be offered in Auction 113 is 
in the Commission’s inventory in 
connection with two Auction 97 
winning bidders having claimed small 
business bidding credits for which the 
Commission later determined they were 
ineligible. Applicants should be 
mindful that the Commission will 
closely examine qualifications of all 
applicant claims of bidding credit 
eligibility and strictly enforce its 
designated entity eligibility 
requirements. 
Moreover, the Commission’s rules 
include a prohibition, which applies to 
all applicants (whether they seek 
bidding credits or not), against changes 
in ownership of the applicant that 
would constitute an assignment or 
transfer of control after the initial filing 
deadline for FCC Form 175. Applicants 
should not expect to receive any 
opportunities to revise their ownership 
structure after the filing of their short- 
and long-form applications, including 
making revisions to their agreements or 
other arrangements with interest 
holders, lenders, or others in order to 
address potential concerns relating to 
compliance with the designated entity 
bidding credit requirements. 
This policy will help to ensure 
compliance with the Commission’s 
rules applicable to the award of bidding 
credits prior to the conduct of the 
auction, which will involve competing 
bids from those that do and do not seek 
bidding credits, and thus preserves the 
integrity of the auction process. OEA 
and WTB also believe that this will meet 
the Commission’s statutory objectives in 
awarding licenses through the 
competitive bidding process. 
OEA and WTB did not make any 
proposals or seek comment in the 
Auction 113 Comment Public Notice on 
eligibility for bidding credits or the 
small business bidding credit levels for 
Auction 113, however, two parties 
offered comments on this topic, seeking 
to roll back to the small business 
definitions and bidding credits and 
other designated entity rules that had 
been used in Auction 97 held in 2014. 
These comments are not addressed in 
this proceeding because the 
Commission has already addressed 
those contentions and determined 
bidding credit eligibility and the levels 
of small business bidding credits 
available in Auction 113 in the 2025 
AWS–3 Report and Order. 
1. Small Business Bidding Credit 
For Auction 113, bidding credits will 
be available to eligible small businesses 
and consortia thereof, subject to the 
bidding credit caps adopted in the 
Auction 113 Procedures Public Notice. 
Under the service rules applicable to 
AWS–3 band licenses to be offered in 
Auction 113, the two-tiers of bidding 
credits available are determined as 
follows: 
€A bidder that qualifies as a ‘‘small business’’—i.e., one with attributed average annual gross revenues that do 
not exceed $55 million for the preceding 
five years—is eligible to receive a 15% 
discount on its overall payment. 
€A bidder that qualifies as a ‘‘very small business’’—i.e., one with attributed average annual gross revenues 
that do not exceed $20 million for the 
preceding five years—is eligible to 
receive a 25% discount on its overall 
payment. 
Small business bidding credits are not 
cumulative; an eligible applicant may 
receive either the 15% or the 25% 
bidding credit on its overall payment, 
but not both. The Commission’s unjust 
enrichment provisions also apply to a 
winning bidder that uses a bidding 
credit and subsequently seeks to assign 
or transfer control of its license within 
a certain period to an entity not 
qualifying for at least the same level of 
small business bidding credit. 
Each applicant seeking a small 
business bidding credit must disclose 
the gross revenues for the preceding five 
years for each of the following: (1) the 
applicant, (2) its affiliates, (3) its 
controlling interests, and (4) the 
affiliates of its controlling interests. The 
applicant must also submit an 
attachment that lists all parties with 
which the applicant has entered into 
any spectrum use agreements or 
arrangements for any licenses that may 
be won by the applicant in Auction 113. 
In addition, to the extent that an 
applicant has an agreement with any 
disclosable interest holder for the use of 
more than 25% of the spectrum capacity 
of any license that may be won in 
Auction 113, the applicant must 
disclose the identity and the attributable 
gross revenues of any such disclosable 
interest holder. This attribution rule 
will be applied on a license-by-license 
basis. As a result, an applicant may be 
eligible for a bidding credit on some, but 
not all, of the licenses for which it is 
bidding in Auction 113. If an applicant 
is applying as a consortium of small 
businesses, then the disclosures 
described in this paragraph must be 
provided for each consortium member. 
2. Rural Service Provider Bidding Credit 
An eligible applicant may request a 
15% discount on its overall payment 
using a rural service provider bidding 
credit, subject to the cap discussed 
below. To be eligible for a rural service 
provider bidding credit, an applicant 
must: (1) be a service provider that is in 
the business of providing commercial 
communications services and, together 
with its controlling interests, affiliates, 
and the affiliates of its controlling 
interests, has fewer than 250,000 
combined wireless, wireline, 
broadband, and cable subscribers; and 
(2) serve predominantly rural areas. 
Rural areas are defined as counties with 
a population density of 100 or fewer 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59993 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations persons per square mile. An applicant 
seeking a rural service provider bidding 
credit must provide the number of 
subscribers served as of the short-form 
application deadline. An applicant may 
count any subscriber as a single 
subscriber even if that subscriber 
receives more than one service. 
Each applicant seeking a rural service 
provider bidding credit must disclose 
the number of its subscribers, along 
with the number of subscribers of its 
affiliates, controlling interests, and the 
affiliates of its controlling interests. The 
applicant must also submit an 
attachment that lists all parties with 
which the applicant has entered into 
any spectrum use agreements or 
arrangements for any licenses that may 
be won by the applicant in Auction 113. 
In addition, to the extent that an 
applicant has an agreement with any 
disclosable interest holder for the use of 
more than 25% of the spectrum capacity 
of any license that may be won in 
Auction 113, the identity and the 
attributable subscribers of any such 
disclosable interest holder must be 
disclosed. Like applicants seeking 
eligibility for small business bidding 
credits, eligible rural service providers 
may also form a consortium. If an 
applicant is applying as a consortium of 
rural service providers, then the 
disclosures described in this paragraph, 
including the certification, must be 
provided for each consortium member. 
3. Attributable Interests 
Controlling Interests and Affiliates. 
Pursuant to 47 CFR 1.2110, an 
applicant’s eligibility for bidding credits 
is determined by attributing the gross 
revenues (for those seeking small 
business benefits) or subscribers (for 
those seeking rural service provider 
benefits) of the applicant, its affiliates, 
its controlling interests, and the 
affiliates of its controlling interests. This 
information must therefore be disclosed 
in the short-form application of any 
auction participant seeking a small 
business or rural service provider 
bidding credit. Controlling interests of 
an applicant include individuals and 
entities with either de facto or de jure control of the applicant. Typically, 
ownership of greater than 50% of an 
entity’s voting stock evidences de jure 
control. De facto control is determined on a case-by-case basis based on the 
totality of the circumstances. The 
following are some common indicia of 
de facto control: 
€the entity constitutes or appoints more than 50% of the board of directors 
or management committee; 
€the entity has authority to appoint, promote, demote, and fire senior 
executives that control the day-to-day 
activities of the licensee; and 
€the entity plays an integral role in management decisions. 
Additionally, for attribution purposes, 
officers and directors of an applicant 
seeking a bidding credit are considered 
to have a controlling interest in the 
applicant. Applicants should refer to 47 
CFR 1.2110(c)(2) and the FCC Form 175 
Instructions to understand how certain 
interests are calculated in determining 
control for purposes of attributing gross 
revenues. 
Affiliates of an applicant or 
controlling interest include an 
individual or entity that: (1) directly or 
indirectly controls or has the power to 
control the applicant, (2) is directly or 
indirectly controlled by the applicant, 
(3) is directly or indirectly controlled by 
a third party that also controls or has the 
power to control the applicant, or (4) 
has an ‘‘identity of interest’’ with the 
applicant. The Commission’s definition 
of an affiliate of the applicant 
encompasses both controlling interests 
of the applicant and affiliates of 
controlling interests of the applicant. 
For more information on how to 
disclose information regarding 
controlling interests and affiliates, 
applicants should refer to 47 CFR 
1.2110(c)(2) and (c)(5) respectively, as 
well as the FCC Form 175 Instructions. 
An applicant seeking a small business 
bidding credit must demonstrate, 
through its disclosures, its eligibility for 
the bidding credit by: (1) meeting the 
applicable small business size standard, 
based on the Commission’s controlling 
interest and affiliation rules; and (2) 
retaining control, on a license-by-license 
basis, over the spectrum associated with 
the licenses for which it seeks small 
business benefits. For purposes of the 
first prong of the standard, applicants 
should note that control and affiliation 
may arise through, among other things, 
ownership interests, voting interests, 
management and other operating 
agreements, or the terms of any other 
types of agreements—including 
spectrum lease agreements—that 
independently or together create a 
controlling, or potentially controlling, 
interest in the applicant’s or licensee’s 
business as a whole. In addition, once 
an applicant demonstrates eligibility as 
a small business under the first prong, 
it must also be eligible for benefits on 
a license-by-license basis under the 
second prong. As part of making the 
FCC Form 175 certification that it is 
qualified as a designated entity under 47 
CFR 1.2110, an applicant is certifying 
that it does not have any spectrum use 
or other agreements that would confer 
either de jure or de facto control of any license it seeks to acquire with bidding 
credits. 
With respect to the retention of 
control over the spectrum associated 
with the licenses at issue, applicants 
should note that, under this standard for 
evaluating eligibility for small business 
bidding credits, if an applicant executes 
a spectrum use agreement that does not 
comply with the Commission’s relevant 
standard of de facto control, then it will 
be subject to unjust enrichment 
obligations for the benefits associated 
with that particular license. If that 
spectrum use agreement (either alone or 
in combination with the Commission’s 
designated entity controlling interest 
and attribution rules) goes so far as to 
confer control of the applicant’s overall 
business, then the gross revenues of the 
additional interest holders will be 
attributed to the applicant, which could 
render the applicant ineligible for all 
current and future small business 
benefits on all licenses. 
Limitation on Spectrum Use. Under 
47 CFR 1.2110(c)(2)(ii)(J), the gross 
revenues (or the subscribers, in the case 
of a rural service provider) of an 
applicant’s disclosable interest holder 
are attributable to the applicant, on a 
license-by-license basis, if the 
disclosable interest holder has an 
agreement with the applicant to use, in 
any manner, more than 25% of the 
spectrum capacity of any license won by 
the applicant and acquired with a 
bidding credit during the five-year 
unjust enrichment period for the 
applicable license. For purposes of this 
requirement, a disclosable interest 
holder of an applicant seeking 
designated entity benefits is defined as 
any individual or entity holding a 10% 
or greater interest of any kind in the 
applicant, including but not limited to, 
a 10% or greater interest in any class of 
stock, warrants, options, or debt 
securities in the applicant or licensee. 
Any applicant seeking a bidding credit 
for licenses won in Auction 113 will be 
subject to this attribution rule and must 
make the requisite disclosures. 
Certain disclosable interest holders 
may be excluded from this attribution 
rule. Specifically, an applicant claiming 
the rural service provider bidding credit 
may have a spectrum license use 
agreement with a disclosable interest 
holder, without having to attribute the 
disclosable interest holder’s subscribers, 
so long as the disclosable interest holder 
is independently eligible for a rural 
service provider credit and the 
disclosable interest holder’s spectrum 
use and any spectrum use agreement is 
otherwise permissible under the 
Commission’s existing rules. If 
applicable, the applicant must attach to

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59994 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations its FCC Form 175 any additional 
information as may be required to 
indicate any license that may be subject 
to this attribution rule or to demonstrate 
its eligibility for the exception from this 
attribution rule. Consistent with the 
Commission’s limited information 
procedures, OEA and WTB intend to 
withhold from public disclosure all 
information contained in any such 
attachments until after the close of 
Auction 113. 
Exceptions from Attribution Rules for 
Small Businesses and Rural Service 
Providers. Applicants claiming designated entity benefits may be 
eligible for certain exceptions from the 
Commission’s attribution rules. For 
example, in calculating an applicant’s 
gross revenues under the controlling 
interest standard, the Commission will 
not attribute to the applicant the 
personal net worth, including personal 
income, of its officers and directors. 
However, to the extent that the officers 
and directors of the applicant are 
controlling interest holders of other 
entities, the gross revenues of those 
entities will be attributed to the 
applicant. Moreover, if an officer or 
director operates a separate business, 
then the gross revenues derived from 
that business would be attributed to the 
applicant. 
The Commission has also exempted 
from attribution to the applicant the 
gross revenues of the affiliates of a rural 
telephone cooperative’s officers and 
directors, if certain conditions specified 
in 47 CFR 1.2110(b)(4)(iii) are met. An 
applicant claiming this exemption must 
provide, in an attachment, an 
affirmative statement that the applicant, 
affiliate, and/or controlling interest is an 
eligible rural telephone cooperative 
within the meaning of 47 
CFR1.2110(b)(4)(iii), and the applicant 
must supply any additional information 
as may be required to demonstrate 
eligibility for the exemption from the 
attribution rule. 
An applicant claiming a rural service 
provider bidding credit may be eligible 
for an exception from the Commission’s 
attribution rules as an existing rural 
partnership. To qualify for this 
exception, an applicant must be a rural 
partnership providing service as of July 
16, 2015, and each member of the rural 
partnership must individually have 
fewer than 250,000 combined wireless, 
wireline, broadband, and cable 
subscribers. Because each member of 
the rural partnership must individually 
qualify for the bidding credit, by 
definition, a partnership that includes a 
nationwide provider as a member will 
not be eligible for the benefit. 
Finally, a consortium of small 
businesses or rural service providers 
may seek an exception from the 
Commission’s attribution rules. Under 
the Commission’s rules, a consortium of 
small businesses or rural service 
providers is a conglomerate organization 
composed of two or more entities, each 
of which individually satisfies the 
definition of small business or rural 
service provider. A consortium must 
provide additional information for each 
member demonstrating each member’s 
eligibility for the claimed bidding credit 
in order to show that the applicant 
satisfies the eligibility criteria for the 
bidding credit. The gross revenue or 
subscriber information of each 
consortium member will not be 
aggregated for purposes of determining 
the consortium’s eligibility for the 
claimed bidding credit. This 
information must be provided, however, 
to ensure that each consortium member 
qualifies for the bidding credit sought 
by the consortium. 
I. Provisions Regarding Former and 
Current Defaulters 
Pursuant to the rules governing 
competitive bidding, each applicant 
must make certifications regarding 
whether it is a current or former 
defaulter or delinquent. A current 
defaulter or delinquent is not eligible to 
participate in Auction 113, but a former 
defaulter or delinquent may participate 
so long as it is otherwise qualified and 
makes an upfront payment that is 50% 
more than would otherwise be 
necessary. Accordingly, each applicant 
must certify under penalty of perjury on 
its FCC Form 175 that it, its affiliates, its 
controlling interests, and the affiliates of 
its controlling interests are not in 
default on any payment for a 
Commission construction permit or 
license (including down payments) and 
that they are not delinquent on any non- 
tax debt owed to any Federal agency. 
Additionally, an applicant must certify 
under penalty of perjury whether it 
(along with its controlling interests) has 
ever been in default on any payment for 
a Commission construction permit or 
license (including down payments) or 
has ever been delinquent on any non-tax 
debt owed to any Federal agency, 
subject to the specific exclusions 
provided in the Commission’s rules. For 
purposes of making these certifications, 
the term ‘‘controlling interest’’ is 
defined in 47 CFR 1.2105(a)(4)(i). 
Under the Commission’s rule 
regarding applications by former 
defaulters, an applicant is considered a 
‘‘former defaulter’’ or a ‘‘former 
delinquent’’ when, as of the FCC Form 
175 filing deadline, the applicant or any 
of its controlling interests has defaulted 
on any Commission construction permit 
or license or has been delinquent on any 
non-tax debt owed to any Federal 
agency, but has since remedied all such 
defaults and cured all the outstanding 
non-tax delinquencies. For purposes of 
the certification under 47 CFR 
1.2105(a)(2)(xii), the applicant may 
exclude from consideration any cured 
default on a Commission construction 
permit or license or cured delinquency 
on a non-tax debt owed to a Federal 
agency for which any of the following 
criteria are met: (1) the notice of the 
final payment deadline or delinquency 
was received more than seven years 
before the FCC Form 175 filing 
deadline, (2) the default or delinquency 
amounted to less than $100,000, (3) the 
default or delinquency was paid within 
two quarters (i.e., six months) after receiving the notice of the final payment 
deadline or delinquency, or (4) the 
default or delinquency was the subject 
of a legal or arbitration proceeding and 
was cured upon resolution of the 
proceeding. With respect to the first 
exclusion, notice to a debtor may 
include notice of a final payment 
deadline or notice of delinquency and 
may be express or implied depending 
on the origin of any Federal non-tax 
debt giving rise to a default or 
delinquency. Additionally, for the third 
exclusion, the date of receipt of the 
notice of a final default deadline or 
delinquency by the intended party or 
debtor will be used for purposes of 
verifying receipt of notice. 
In addition to the Auction 113 
Procedures Public Notice, applicants are 
encouraged to review previous guidance 
on default and delinquency disclosure 
requirements in the context of the 
auction short-form application process. 
Parties are also encouraged to consult 
with Auctions Division staff if they have 
any questions about default and 
delinquency disclosure requirements. 
The Commission considers 
outstanding debts owed to the United 
States Government, in any amount, to be 
a serious matter. The Commission has 
previously adopted rules, including a 
provision referred to as the ‘‘red light 
rule,’’ that implement its obligations 
under the Debt Collection Improvement 
Act of 1996, which governs the 
collection of debts owed to the United 
States. Under the red light rule, 
applications and other requests for 
benefits filed by parties that have 
outstanding debts owed to the 
Commission will not be processed. 
When adopting that rule, the 
Commission explicitly declared, 
however, that its competitive bidding 
rules ‘‘are not affected’’ by the red light 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59995 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations rule. As a consequence, the 
Commission’s adoption of the red light 
rule does not alter the applicability of 
any of its competitive bidding rules, 
including the provisions and 
certifications of 47 CFR 1.2105 and 
1.2106, with regard to current and 
former defaults or delinquencies. 
OEA and WTB remind each applicant, 
however, that any indication in the 
Commission’s Red Light Display 
System, which provides information 
regarding debts currently owed to the 
Commission, may not be determinative 
of an auction applicant’s ability to 
comply with the default and 
delinquency disclosure requirements of 
47 CFR 1.2105. Thus, while the red light 
rule ultimately may prevent the 
processing of long-form applications by 
auction winners, an auction applicant’s 
lack of current ‘‘red light’’ status is not 
necessarily determinative of its 
eligibility to participate in an auction 
(or whether it may be subject to an 
increased upfront payment obligation). 
Moreover, a prospective applicant in 
Auction 113 should note that any long- 
form applications filed after the close of 
bidding will be reviewed for compliance 
with the Commission’s red light rule, 
and such review may result in the 
dismissal of a winning bidder’s long- 
form application. OEA and WTB 
encourage each applicant to carefully 
review all records and other available 
Federal agency databases and 
information sources to determine 
whether the applicant, or any of its 
affiliates, or any of its controlling 
interests, or any of the affiliates of its 
controlling interests, owes or was ever 
delinquent in the payment of non-tax 
debt owed to any Federal agency. 
J. Modifications to FCC Form 175 
1. Duty To Maintain Accuracy and 
Completeness of FCC Form 175 
Pursuant to 47 CFR 1.65, each 
applicant has a continuing obligation to 
maintain the accuracy and completeness 
of information furnished in a pending 
application, including a pending 
application to participate in Auction 
113. Consistent with the requirements 
for prior spectrum auctions, an 
applicant for Auction 113 must furnish 
additional or corrected information to 
the Commission within five business 
days after a significant occurrence, or 
amend its FCC Form 175 no more than 
five business days after the applicant 
becomes aware of the need for the 
amendment. An applicant is obligated 
to amend its pending application even 
if a reported change may result in the 
dismissal of the application because it is 
subsequently determined to be a major 
modification. 
2. Modifying an FCC Form 175 
A party seeking to participate in 
Auction 113 must file an FCC Form 175 
electronically via the AAP in the AAS. 
During the initial filing window, an 
applicant will be able to make any 
necessary modifications to its FCC Form 
175 in the AAP. An applicant that has 
certified and submitted its FCC Form 
175 before the close of the initial filing 
window may continue to make 
modifications as often as necessary until 
the close of that window; however, the 
applicant must re-certify and re-submit 
its FCC Form 175 before the close of the 
initial filing window to confirm and 
effect its latest application changes. 
After each submission, a confirmation 
page will be displayed stating the 
submission time and submission date. 
An applicant will also be allowed to 
modify its FCC Form 175 in the AAP, 
except for certain fields, during the 
resubmission filing window and after 
the release of the public notice 
announcing the qualified bidders for an 
auction. During these times, if an 
applicant needs to make permissible 
minor changes to its FCC Form 175 or 
must make changes in order to maintain 
the accuracy and completeness of its 
application pursuant to 47 CFR 1.65 and 
1.2105(b)(4), then it must make the 
change(s) in the AAP and re-certify and 
re-submit its application to confirm and 
effect the change(s). 
An applicant’s ability to modify its 
FCC Form 175 in the AAP will be 
limited between the closing of the initial 
filing window and the opening of the 
application resubmission filing window, 
and between the closing of the 
resubmission filing window and the 
release of the public notice announcing 
the qualified bidders for an auction. 
During these periods, an applicant will 
be able to view its submitted 
application, but will be permitted to 
modify only the applicant’s address, 
responsible party address, and contact 
information (e.g., name, address, telephone number) in the AAP. An 
applicant will not be able to modify any 
other pages of the FCC Form 175 in the 
AAP during these periods. If, during 
these periods, an applicant needs to 
make other permissible minor changes 
to its FCC Form 175, or changes to 
maintain the accuracy and completeness 
of its application pursuant to 47 CFR 
1.65 and 1.2105(b)(4), then the applicant 
must submit a letter briefly 
summarizing the changes to its FCC 
Form 175 via email to auction113@
fcc.gov. The email summarizing the changes must include a subject line 
referring to Auction 113 and the name 
of the applicant, for example, ‘‘Re: 
Changes to Auction 113 Auction 
Application of XYZ Corp.’’ Any 
attachments to the email must be 
formatted as Adobe

Acrobat

(PDF) or 
Microsoft

Word documents. An 
applicant that submits its changes in 
this manner must subsequently modify, 
certify, and submit its FCC Form 175 
application(s) electronically in the AAP 
once it is again open and available to 
applicants. 
Applicants should also note that even 
at times when the AAP is open and 
available to applicants, the system will 
not allow an applicant to make certain 
other permissible changes itself (e.g., 
correcting a misstatement of the 
applicant’s legal classification). If an 
applicant needs to make a permissible 
minor change of this nature, then it 
must submit a written request by email 
to the Auctions Division Chief, via 
auction113@fcc.gov requesting that the Commission manually make the change 
on the applicant’s behalf. Once 
Commission staff has informed the 
applicant that the change has been made 
in the Auction Application Portal, the 
applicant must then re-certify and re- 
submit its FCC Form 175 in the AAP to 
confirm and effect the change(s). 
As with filing the FCC Form 175, any 
amendment(s) to the application and 
related statements of fact must be 
certified by an authorized representative 
of the applicant with authority to bind 
the applicant. Applicants should note 
that submission of any such amendment 
or related statement of fact constitutes a 
representation by the person certifying 
that he or she is an authorized 
representative with such authority and 
that the contents of the amendment or 
statement of fact are true and correct. 
Applicants must not submit 
application-specific material through 
the Commission’s Electronic Comment 
Filing System. Further, parties 
submitting information related to their 
applications should use caution to 
ensure that their submissions do not 
contain confidential information or 
communicate information that would 
violate 47 CFR 1.2105(c) or the limited 
information procedures adopted for 
Auction 113. An applicant seeking to 
submit, outside the AAP, information 
that might reflect non-public 
information, such as an applicant’s 
license selection(s), upfront payment 
amount, or bidding eligibility, should 
consider including in its email a request 
that the filing or portions of the filing be 
withheld from public inspection until 
the end of the prohibition on certain 
communications pursuant to 47 
CFR1.2105(c).

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59996 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations Questions about FCC Form 175 
amendments should be directed to the 
Auctions Division at auction113@
fcc.gov or (202) 418–0660. IV. Information Procedures and 
Prohibited Communications 
A. Information Procedures During the 
Auction Process 
Consistent with past practice in many 
prior spectrum license auctions, OEA 
and WTB adopt the proposal to limit 
information available during Auction 
113 in order to prevent the 
identification of bidders placing 
particular bids until after the bidding 
has closed. Specifically, OEA and WTB 
will not make public until after bidding 
has closed: (1) the licenses that an 
applicant selects for bidding in its short- 
form application, (2) the amount of any 
upfront payment made by or on behalf 
of an applicant for Auction 113, (3) any 
applicant’s bidding eligibility, and (4) 
any other bidding-related information 
that might reveal the identity of the 
bidder placing a bid. Moreover, OEA 
and WTB will not make public until 
after the close of the auction whether an 
applicant has submitted with its short- 
form application a signed 
acknowledgment statement regarding 
the acceptance of interference from 
Federal incumbents for operations in 
the 1755–1780 MHz. 
OEA and WTB also adopt their 
proposal to make public after each 
bidding round, for each license, the 
aggregate demand, the posted price of 
the last completed round, and the clock 
price for the next round. The identities 
of bidders making specific bids will not 
be disclosed until after the close of 
bidding in the auction. Bids placed 
according to a bidder’s proxy 
instructions will be made available, but 
a bidder’s proxy instructions will not be 
disclosed because they may contain 
price information private to the bidder. 
The limited comment OEA and WTB 
received on this proposal largely 
supports adopting it. 
Each bidder will have access to 
additional information related to its 
own bidding and bid eligibility. 
Specifically, after the bids of a round 
have been processed, the bidding 
system will inform each bidder of its 
processed demand for each license, its 
proxy instructions, and its eligibility for 
the next round. The identities of bidders 
placing specific bids will not be disclosed until after the close of 
bidding. After the close of bidding, 
bidders’ license selections, upfront 
payment amounts, bidding eligibility, 
bids, and other bidding-related actions 
will be made publicly available. 
The limited information procedures 
(sometimes also referred to as 
anonymous bidding) OEA and WTB 
adopt here have been effective in past 
auctions to safeguard against potential 
anticompetitive behavior such as 
retaliatory bidding and collusion. 
Commenters generally support adopting 
the limited information procedures as 
proposed. One commenter supports 
adopting limited information 
procedures generally to promote fair 
competition and discourage anti- 
competitive conduct, but suggests a 
more restrictive approach—i.e., 
implementing phased disclosures of 
aggregate demand data, contending that 
in smaller markets with fewer licenses 
available, bidding patterns and price 
movements revealed by the proposed 
limited information procedures can 
indirectly reveal biding strategies. 
Another commenter, however, asks OEA 
and WTB to reject these suggested 
enhancements, arguing that such 
additional procedures would complicate 
the development of Auction 113 bidding 
software and strategies and that there is 
no reason for the Commission ‘‘to stray 
from the tried-and-true bidding 
framework that has made its auctions a 
success.’’ 
Because the commenter suggesting 
this more restrictive approach provides 
no evidence that the limited information 
procedures used in the Commission’s 
past auctions have facilitated 
anticompetitive bidding behavior in any 
auction, OEA and WTB are not 
persuaded that they should depart from 
the Commission’s now-established 
practice of implementing these 
procedures in wireless spectrum 
auctions, and they conclude that the 
competitive benefits associated with 
limiting information disclosure support 
adoption of such procedures and 
outweigh any potential benefits of full 
disclosure. OEA and WTB also agree 
that implementing the proposal for the 
phased disclosure of aggregate demand 
data would unnecessarily complicate 
Auction 113 bidding procedures. 
OEA and WTB warn applicants that 
direct or indirect communication to 
other applicants or the public disclosure 
of non-public information (e.g., 
reductions in eligibility, identities of 
bidders) could violate the Commission’s 
rule prohibiting certain 
communications. Therefore, to the 
extent an applicant believes that such a 
disclosure is required by law or 
regulation, including regulations issued 
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC), OEA and WTB 
strongly urge that the applicant consult 
with Commission staff in the Auctions 
Division before making such disclosure. 
B. Prohibited Communications and 
Compliance With Antitrust Laws 
The rules prohibiting certain 
communications set forth in 47 CFR 
1.2105(c) apply to each ‘‘applicant’’ in 
Auction 113. 47 CFR 1.2105(c)(1) 
provides that, subject to specified 
exceptions, ‘‘[a]fter the short-form 
application filing deadline, all 
applicants are prohibited from 
cooperating or collaborating with 
respect to, communicating with or 
disclosing, to each other or any 
nationwide provider [of 
communications services] that is not an 
applicant, or, if the applicant is a 
nationwide provider, any non- 
nationwide provider that is not an 
applicant, in any manner the substance 
of their own, or each other’s, or any 
other applicants’ bids or bidding 
strategies (including post-auction 
market structure), or discussing or 
negotiating settlement agreements, until 
after the down payment deadline[.]’’ 
Any applicant found to have violated 
these communication prohibitions may 
be subject to sanctions. 
1. Entities Subject to 47 CFR 1.2105(c) 
An ‘‘applicant’’ for purposes of this 
rule includes all ‘‘controlling interests’’ 
in the entity submitting the FCC Form 
175 auction application, as well as all 
holders of interests amounting to 10% 
or more of the entity (including 
institutional investors and asset 
management companies), and all 
officers and directors of that entity. 
Under 47 CFR 1.2105(c), a party that 
submits an application becomes an 
‘‘applicant’’ under the rule, which goes 
into effect at the application deadline, 
and that status does not change based 
on later developments. 
2. Prohibition Applies Until Down 
Payment Deadline 
The prohibition in 47 CFR 1.2105(c) 
on certain communications begins at an 
auction’s short-form application filing 
deadline and ends at the auction’s down 
payment deadline after the auction 
closes, which will be announced in a 
future public notice. To be clear, 
communications that occur even after 
bidding has ended and the auction has 
closed, but before the down payment 
deadline, are still subject to 47 CFR 
1.2105(c). 
3. Scope of Prohibition on Certain 
Communications; Prohibition on Joint 
Bidding Agreements 
47 CFR 1.2105(c) prohibits certain 
communications between applicants for 
an auction, regardless of whether the 
applicants seek permits or licenses in 
the same geographic area or market. The 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59997 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations rule also applies to communications by 
applicants with non-applicant 
nationwide providers of 
communications services and by 
nationwide applicants with non- 
applicant, non-nationwide providers. 
For purposes of the prohibited 
communications rule for Auction 113, 
OEA and WTB consider AT&T, T- 
Mobile, and Verizon to be ‘‘nationwide 
providers.’’ The rule further prohibits 
‘‘joint bidding arrangements,’’ including 
arrangements relating to the permits or 
licenses being auctioned that address or 
communicate, directly or indirectly, 
bidding at the auction, bidding 
strategies, including arrangements 
regarding price or the specific permits 
or licenses on which to bid, and any 
such arrangements relating to the post- 
auction market structure. The rule 
allows for limited exceptions for 
communications within the scope of 
any arrangement consistent with the 
exclusion from the Commission’s rule 
prohibiting joint bidding, provided such 
arrangement is disclosed on the 
applicant’s auction application. 
Applicants may communicate pursuant 
to any pre-existing agreements, 
arrangements, or understandings 
relating to the licenses being auctioned 
that are solely operational or that 
provide for the transfer or assignment of 
licenses, provided that such agreements, 
arrangements, or understandings are 
disclosed on their applications and do 
not address or communicate bids 
(including amounts), bidding strategies, 
or the particular permits or licenses on 
which to bid or the post-auction market 
structure. 
In addition to express statements of 
bids and bidding strategies, the 
prohibition against communicating ‘‘in 
any manner’’ includes public 
disclosures as well as private 
communications and indirect or 
implicit communications. 
Consequently, an applicant must take 
care to determine whether its auction- 
related communications may reach 
another applicant. 
Parties subject to 47 CFR 1.2105(c) 
should take special care in 
circumstances where their officers, 
directors, and employees may receive 
information directly or indirectly 
relating to any applicant’s bids or 
bidding strategies, even if the officers, 
directors, or employees are not involved 
in their company’s participation in the 
auction or if the information received is 
wholly unsolicited. Such information 
may be deemed to have been received 
by the applicant under certain 
circumstances. For example, 
Commission staff have found that, 
where an individual serves as an officer 
and director for two or more applicants, 
the bids and bidding strategies of one 
applicant are presumed to be conveyed 
to the other applicant through the 
shared officer, which creates an 
apparent violation of the rule. 
Subject to the limited exceptions for 
communications within the scope of 
any arrangement consistent with the 
exclusion from the Commission’s rule 
prohibiting joint bidding, 47 CFR 
1.2105(c)(1) prohibits applicants from 
communicating with specified other 
parties only with respect to ‘‘their own, 
or each other’s, or any other applicant’s 
bids or bidding strategies.’’ The 
Prohibited Communications Guidance 
Public Notice, 80 FR 63215 (October 19, 
2015), released in advance of the 
Broadcast Incentive Auction (Auction 
1000), reviewed the scope of the 
prohibition generally, as well as in that 
specific auction’s forward auction of 
spectrum licenses and reverse auction to 
relinquish broadcast licenses. As the 
Commission explained therein, a 
communication conveying ‘‘bids or 
bidding strategies (including post- 
auction market structure)’’ must also 
relate to the ‘‘licenses being auctioned’’ 
in order to be covered by the 
prohibition. Thus, the prohibition is 
limited in scope and does not apply to 
all communications between or among 
the specified parties. The Commission 
consistently has made clear that 
application of the rule prohibiting 
communications has never required 
total suspension of essential ongoing 
business. Entities subject to the 
prohibition may negotiate agreements 
during the prohibition period, provided 
that the communications involved do 
not relate to both: (1) the licenses being 
auctioned and (2) bids or bidding 
strategies or post-auction market 
structure. 
Accordingly, business discussions 
and negotiations that do not convey 
information about the bids or bidding 
strategies, including the post-auction 
market structure, of an applicant are not 
prohibited by the rule. Moreover, not all 
auction-related information is covered 
by the prohibition. For example, 
communicating merely whether a party 
has or has not applied to participate in 
Auction 113 will not violate the rule. In 
contrast, communicating, among other 
things, how a party will participate, 
including specific geographic areas 
selected, specific bid amounts, and/or 
whether or not the party is placing bids, 
would convey bids or bidding strategies 
and would be prohibited 
While 47 CFR 1.2105(c) does not 
prohibit business discussions and 
negotiations among auction applicants 
that are unrelated to the auction, each 
applicant must remain vigilant not to 
communicate, directly or indirectly, 
information that affects, or could affect, 
bids or bidding strategies. Certain 
discussions, even if they do not directly 
address the licenses offered in Auction 
113 or the AWS–1 and AWS–3 bands 
still might touch upon subject areas that 
relate to bids and bidding strategies or 
to post-auction market structure, which 
could convey price or geographic 
information related to bidding 
strategies. Such subject areas include, 
but are not limited to, management, 
sales, local marketing agreements, and 
other transactional agreements. 
OEA and WTB caution applicants that 
bids or bidding strategies may be 
communicated outside situations that 
involve one party subject to the 
prohibition communicating privately 
and directly with another such party. 
For example, the Commission has 
warned that prohibited 
‘‘communications concerning bids and 
bidding strategies may include 
communications regarding capital calls 
or requests for additional funds in 
support of bids or bidding strategies to 
the extent such communications convey 
information concerning the bids and 
bidding strategies directly or 
indirectly.’’ Moreover, the Commission 
found a violation of the rule against 
prohibited communications when an 
applicant used the Commission’s 
bidding system to disclose ‘‘its bidding 
strategy in a manner that explicitly 
invited other auction participants to 
cooperate and collaborate . . . in 
specific markets,’’ and it has placed 
auction participants on notice that the 
use of its bidding system ‘‘to disclose 
market information to competitors will 
not be tolerated and will subject bidders 
to sanctions.’’ 
Likewise, when completing a short- 
form application, each applicant should 
avoid any statements or disclosures that 
may violate 47 CFR 1.2105(c), 
particularly in light of the limited 
information procedures in effect for 
Auction 113. Specifically, an applicant 
should avoid including any information 
in its short-form application that might 
convey information regarding its license 
selections, such as referring to markets 
or other geographic areas in describing 
agreements, including any information 
in application attachments that will be 
publicly available that may otherwise 
disclose the applicant’s license 
selections, or using applicant names or 
attachment file names in the application 
that refer to licenses being offered. 
Applicants also should be mindful 
that communicating non-public 
application or bidding information 
publicly or privately to another 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59998 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations applicant may violate 47 CFR 1.2105(c) 
even though that information 
subsequently may be made public 
during later periods of the application 
or bidding processes. 
4. Communicating With Third Parties 
47 CFR 1.2105(c) does not prohibit an 
applicant from communicating bids or 
bidding strategies to a third party, such 
as a consultant or consulting firm, 
counsel, or lender. An applicant should 
take appropriate steps, however, to 
ensure that any third party it employs 
for advice pertaining to its bids or 
bidding strategies does not become a 
conduit for prohibited communications 
to other specified parties, as that would 
violate the rule. For example, an 
applicant might require a third party, 
such as a lender, to sign a non- 
disclosure agreement before the 
applicant communicates any 
information regarding bids or bidding 
strategy to the third party. Within third- 
party firms, separate individual 
employees, such as attorneys or auction 
consultants, may advise individual 
applicants on bids or bidding strategies, 
as long as such firms implement 
firewalls and other compliance 
procedures that prevent such 
individuals from communicating the 
bids or bidding strategies of one 
applicant to other individuals 
representing separate applicants. 
Although firewalls and/or other 
procedures should be used, their 
existence is not an absolute defense to 
liability if a violation of the rule has 
occurred. 
As the Commission has noted in other 
spectrum auctions, in the case of an 
individual, the objective precautionary 
measure of a firewall is not available. As 
a result, an individual that is privy to 
bids or bidding information of more 
than one applicant presents a greater 
risk of becoming a conduit for a 
prohibited communication. OEA and 
WTB will take the same approach to 
interpreting the prohibited 
communications rule in Auction 113. 
OEA and WTB emphasize that whether 
a prohibited communication has taken 
place in a given case will depend on all 
the facts pertaining to the case, 
including who possessed what 
information, what information was 
conveyed to whom, and the course of 
bidding in the auction. 
OEA and WTB remind potential 
applicants that they may discuss the 
short-form application or bids for 
specific licenses with the counsel, 
consultant, or expert of their choice 
before the short-form application deadline. Furthermore, the same third- 
party individual could continue to give 
advice after the short-form deadline 
regarding the application, provided that 
no information pertaining to bids or 
bidding strategies, including licenses 
selected on the short-form application, 
is conveyed to that individual. 
Applicants also should use caution in 
their dealings with other parties, such as 
members of the press, financial analysts, 
or others who might become conduits 
for the communication of prohibited 
bidding information. For example, even 
though communicating that it has 
applied to participate in the auction will 
not violate the rule, an applicant’s 
statement to the press or a statement on 
social media that it intends to stop 
bidding in an auction could give rise to 
a finding of a 47 CFR 1.2105 violation. 
Similarly, an applicant’s public 
statement of intent not to place bids 
during bidding in Auction 113 could 
also violate the rule. 
5. 47 CFR 1.2105(c) Certifications 
By electronically submitting its FCC 
Form 175, each applicant for Auction 
113 certifies its compliance with 47 CFR 
1.2105(c) of the rules. The mere filing of 
a certifying statement as part of an 
application, however, will not outweigh 
specific evidence that a prohibited 
communication has occurred, nor will it 
preclude the initiation of an 
investigation when warranted. 
6. Duty To Report Prohibited 
Communications 
47 CFR 1.2105(c)(4) requires that any 
applicant that makes or receives a 
communication that appears to violate 
47 CFR 1.2105(c) must report such 
communication in writing to the 
Commission immediately, and in no 
case later than five business days after 
the communication occurs. Each 
applicant’s obligation to report any such 
communication continues beyond the 
five-day period after the communication 
is made, even if the report is not made 
within the five-day period. 
7. Procedures for Reporting Prohibited 
Communications 
A party reporting any information or 
communication pursuant to 47 CFR 
1.65(a), 1.2105(a)(2), or 1.2105(c)(4) 
must take care to ensure that any report 
of a prohibited communication does not 
itself give rise to a violation of 47 CFR 
1.2105(c). For example, a party’s report 
of a prohibited communication could 
violate the rule by communicating 
prohibited information to other parties 
specified under the rule through the use 
of Commission filing procedures that 
allow such materials to be made 
available for public inspection. 
An applicant must file only a single 
report concerning a prohibited 
communication and must file that report 
with the Commission personnel 
expressly charged with administering 
the Commission’s auctions. This rule is 
designed to minimize the risk of 
inadvertent dissemination of 
information in such reports. Any reports 
required by 47 CFR 1.2105(c) must be 
filed consistent with the instructions set 
forth in the Auction 113 Procedures 
Public Notice. For Auction 113, such 
reports must be filed with the Chief of 
the Auctions Division, Office of 
Economics and Analytics, by the most 
expeditious means available. Any such 
report should be submitted by email to 
the Auctions Division Chief and sent to 
auction113@fcc.gov. If you choose instead to submit a report in hard copy, 
contact Auctions Division staff at 
auction113@fcc.gov or (202) 418–0660 for guidance. 
Given the potential competitive 
sensitivity of public disclosure of 
information in such a report, a party 
seeking to report such a prohibited 
communication should consider 
submitting its report with a request that 
the report or portions of the submission 
be withheld from public inspection by 
following the procedures specified in 47 
CFR 0.459. OEA and WTB encourage 
such parties to coordinate with the 
Auctions Division staff about the 
procedures for submitting such reports. 
8. Additional Information Concerning 
Prohibition on Certain Communications 
in Commission Auctions 
A summary listing of documents 
issued by the Commission and OEA/ 
WTB addressing the application of 47 
CFR 1.2105(c) is available on the 
Commission’s auction web page at 
www.fcc.gov/summary-listing- 
documents-addressing-application-rule- 
prohibiting-certain-communications. 
9. Antitrust Laws 
Regardless of compliance with the 
Commission’s rules, applicants remain 
subject to the antitrust laws, which are 
designed to prevent anticompetitive 
behavior in the marketplace. 
Compliance with the disclosure 
requirements of 47 CFR 1.2105(c)(4) will 
not insulate a party from enforcement of 
the antitrust laws. For instance, a 
violation of the antitrust laws could 
arise out of actions taking place well 
before any party submits a short-form 
application. The Commission has cited 
a number of examples of potentially 
anticompetitive actions that would be 
prohibited under antitrust laws: for 
example, actual or potential competitors 
may not agree to divide territories in 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES59999 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations order to minimize competition, 
regardless of whether they split a market 
in which they both do business, or 
whether they merely reserve one market 
for one and another market for the other. 
To the extent OEA and WTB become 
aware of specific allegations that suggest 
that violations of the federal antitrust 
laws may have occurred, they may refer 
such allegations to the United States 
Department of Justice for investigation. 
If an applicant is found to have violated 
the antitrust laws or the Commission’s 
rules in connection with its 
participation in the competitive bidding 
process, then it may be subject to a 
forfeiture and may be prohibited from 
participating further in Auction 113 and 
in future auctions, among other 
sanctions. 
V. Bidding Procedures 
OEA and WTB adopt their proposal to 
conduct Auction 113 using an 
ascending clock-1 auction format. The 
clock-1 auction format was used in 
Auction 108 and is similar to the clock 
phase of past Commission ascending 
clock auctions, but rather than offering 
multiple generic spectrum blocks in a 
category in a geographic area, each 
frequency-specific license in an EA or 
CMA will constitute its own category 
with a supply of 1. Therefore, in the 
clock-1 auction format adopted for 
Auction 113, bidders will bid on 
frequency-specific licenses in a clock 
phase. This proposal has ample support 
in the record. 
While OEA and WTB set forth the key 
bidding procedures for the clock-1 
auction in the Auction 113 Procedures 
Public Notice, OEA, in conjunction with 
WTB, released concurrently with the 
Auction 113 Procedures Public Notice 
an updated technical guide (Auction 
113 Technical Guide) that provides 
further technical details about the 
adopted bidding procedures. The 
information in the Auction 113 
Technical Guide, which is available in 
the Education section on the Auction 
113 website (www.fcc.gov/auction/113), 
supplements the decisions made by 
OEA and WTB in the Auction 113 
Procedures Public Notice. 
A. Clock-1 Auction Structure 
Under the clock-1 format that OEA 
and WTB adopt, each bidder will be 
able to bid for specific licenses in the 
clock bidding rounds, in license-by- 
license bidding. The auction will 
proceed in a series of rounds, with 
bidding conducted simultaneously for 
all licenses available in the auction. 
Consistent with prior Commission clock 
auctions, for each bidding round, the 
bidding system will announce a clock 
price for each license, and a bidder will 
indicate its demand for licenses at the 
prices associated with the current 
round. Under the clock-1 auction 
format, a bidder’s demand for a license 
can be zero or one. 
The clock price for a license will 
increase from round to round if more 
than one bidder indicates demand for 
the license. The bidding rounds will 
continue until the number of bidders 
demanding each license does not exceed 
one. Once bidding rounds stop, the 
bidder with demand for a license will 
become the winning bidder. 
B. Individual Licenses in Two 
Geographic Area Types 
Auction 113 will offer 200 geographic 
area-based licenses in 199 markets in 
the 1695–1710 MHz, 1755–1780 MHz, 
and the 2155–2180 MHz bands. The 
Auction 113 inventory consists of 
licenses in EAs and CMAs. The 48 EA 
licenses include frequency blocks 
designated A1, B1, H, I, and/or J; the 
152 CMA licenses are all for frequency 
block G. In Auction 113, only one 
geographic area (EA173) has more than 
one frequency block available, and it 
includes both the H and the I blocks. 
C. Bidding Rounds 
Auction 113 will consist of sequential 
bidding rounds, each followed by the 
release of round results. OEA and WTB 
will conduct bidding simultaneously for 
all licenses available in the auction. In 
the first bidding round of Auction 113, 
a bidder will indicate whether it 
demands the licenses at the minimum 
opening bid price. Before each 
subsequent bidding round, the bidding 
system will announce a start-of-round 
price and a clock price for each license, 
and during the round, qualified bidders 
will indicate the licenses for which they 
wish to bid at the prices associated with 
the current round. Bidding rounds will 
be open for predetermined periods of 
time. Bidders will be subject to activity 
and eligibility rules that govern the pace 
at which they participate in the auction. 
For each license, the clock price will 
increase from round to round if more 
than one bidder indicates demand for 
that license. The bidding rounds will 
continue until, for every license, 
demand does not exceed one. At that 
point, the bidder still indicating 
demand for a license will be the 
winning bidder. 
The initial bidding schedule will be 
announced in a public notice to be 
released at least one week before the 
start of bidding. Details on viewing 
round results, including the location 
and format of downloadable results files 
for each round, will be released 
concurrent with or prior to that public 
notice. 
A bidder will be able to submit bids 
via the internet through the bidding 
system user interface, the bidding 
system’s upload function, or using the 
auction bidder line. The bidding 
system’s upload function accepts bid 
files in a comma-separated values (CSV) 
text format. The bidding system will 
allow a bidder to submit bids only for 
licenses the bidder selected on its FCC 
Form 175 and for which the bidder has 
sufficient bidding eligibility. 
During each open bidding round, a 
bidder will be able to modify its bids in 
the current bidding round. Bids can be 
modified either through the user 
interface, the bidding system’s upload 
function, or through the auction bidder 
line. If a bidder modifies its bids by 
uploading a new file, then that file, 
including all of the file’s bids and 
modifications, will replace all of the 
bidder’s bids previously submitted in 
the round. The system will take the last 
bid file submission as that bidder’s bids 
for the round. OEA and WTB urge 
bidders to verify their bids in each 
round. Information on how to do so will 
be made available in educational 
materials that OEA will provide, 
including a bidding system user guide 
and an online bidding procedures 
tutorial. 
OEA will retain the discretion to 
change the bidding schedule in order to 
foster an auction pace that reasonably 
balances speed with the bidders’ need to 
study round results and adjust their 
bidding strategies. Such adjustments 
may include changes to the amount of 
time for bidding rounds, the amount of 
time between rounds, or the number of 
rounds per day, depending upon 
bidding activity and other factors. 
D. Stopping Rule 
OEA and WTB adopt their proposal to 
employ a simultaneous stopping rule for 
Auction 113, which means all licenses 
simultaneously remain open for bidding 
until the first round in which, after bid 
processing, no license has excess 
demand, at which point the auction will 
close. 
E. Activity Rule 
For the reasons set forth in the 
Auction 113 Comment Public Notice, 
OEA and WTB adopt their proposal to 
employ an activity rule that requires 
bidders to bid actively throughout the 
auction, rather than wait until late in 
the auction before participating. For this 
clock auction, a bidder’s activity in a 
round for purposes of the activity rule 
will be the sum of the bidding units 
associated with the bidder’s demands as 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60000 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations applied by the bidding system during 
bid processing. Bidders are required to 
be active on a specific percentage (the 
activity requirement percentage) of their 
current bidding eligibility during each 
round of the auction. Failure to 
maintain the requisite activity level will 
result in a reduction in the bidder’s 
eligibility, possibly curtailing or 
eliminating the bidder’s ability to place 
bids in subsequent rounds of the 
auction. 
OEA and WTB adopt their proposal to 
require that bidders maintain a fixed, 
high level of activity in each round of 
Auction 113 in order to maintain 
bidding eligibility. In order for posted 
prices and aggregate demand in the 
clock auction to reflect bidders’ true 
demands reliably, the bidding system 
requires a high activity requirement 
percentage to incentivize bidders to start 
bidding early in the auction for the 
licenses that they want to acquire. 
Consistent with past practice, bidders 
will be required to be active on between 
90% and 100% of their bidding 
eligibility in all clock rounds, with the 
specific percentage for each round to be 
set by OEA. OEA will set the activity 
requirement percentage initially at 95%. 
If the activity requirement is met, then 
the bidder’s eligibility will not change 
for the next round. If the activity 
requirement is not met in a round, the 
bidder’s eligibility will be reduced to an 
amount that brings the bidder into 
compliance with the requirement. 
Bidding activity will be based on the 
bids that are applied by the bidding 
system. That is, if a bidder submits a bid 
to reduce its demand for a license, but 
the bidding system cannot apply the 
request because demand for that license 
will fall below one, then the bidder’s 
activity will reflect its unreduced 
demand (i.e., the license will still count toward the bidder’s activity). 
OEA retains the discretion to change 
the activity requirement percentage 
during the auction. The bidding system 
will announce any such changes in 
advance of the round in which they 
would take effect, giving bidders 
adequate notice to adjust their bidding 
strategies. 
Most commenters did not object to the 
proposal to set the initial activity 
requirement percentage at 95%, which 
the Commission has successfully used 
in every clock auction since the format 
was introduced for the Broadcast 
Incentive Auction. However, one 
commenter proposes to reduce the 
activity requirement to 90% or to use a 
more complicated tiered eligibility 
system to reduce the activity 
requirement below 95%, arguing that 
‘‘strict’’ activity requirements create 
challenges for bidders, especially 
smaller entities, who are ‘‘navigating 
complex auction rules.’’ This 
commenter claims that ‘‘unforeseen 
technical or financial constraints have 
limited bidder activity, leading to a loss 
of eligibility,’’ but provides no examples 
of such instances. OEA and WTB are not 
persuaded by these unsupported 
arguments, and see no convincing 
evidence of a need to deviate from the 
proposed 95% initial activity 
requirement. Moreover, OEA and WTB 
agree that they should not depart from 
the ‘‘tried-and-true bidding framework’’ 
that has made Commission auctions 
successful, including changing features 
that are in place to protect the integrity 
of the auction or introducing features 
that would unnecessarily complicate 
bidding system development or bidding 
strategies. The 95% initial activity 
requirement has consistently 
demonstrated that it balances providing 
bidders with the flexibility to substitute 
across markets in response to learned 
price information with providing 
bidders incentives to bid in each round 
of the auction for the markets that they 
are sincerely interested in. Lowering the 
initial activity requirement could extend 
the duration of the auction if bidders 
delay placing their bids until the 
activity requirement is increased. OEA 
and WTB therefore decline to reduce the 
initial activity requirement below 95% 
because doing so could create more 
uncertainty regarding the exact level of 
bidder demand, provide less helpful 
information to bidders about aggregate 
demand, and likely prolong the auction 
as bidders could delay their bidding 
until later in the auction. 
In the Auction 113 Comment Public 
Notice, OEA and WTB sought comment on procedures for a contingent bidding 
limit that would allow a bidder’s 
submitted bids to have bidding activity 
that is greater than the bidder’s 
eligibility. In particular, OEA and WTB 
sought comment on whether the 
contingent bidding limit would be 
useful with the limited inventory in 
Auction 113 or whether it would add 
unnecessary complexity. The only two 
commenters that addressed this both 
object to allowing contingent bidding in 
Auction 113, arguing that the contingent 
bidding limit would introduce 
complexity and uncertainty into the 
bidding without adding any appreciable 
benefits to the bidders or the 
Commission, and that the contingent 
bidding limit was scarcely utilized by 
bidders based on their analysis of 
bidding data from the Commission’s 
four most recent clock auctions. OEA 
and WTB agree that including a 
contingent bidding limit in Auction 113 
would introduce added complexity. 
Given that Auction 113 has a more 
limited inventory than recent auctions, 
OEA and WTB expect fewer bidders to 
attempt to switch between licenses, 
lowering the likelihood that bidders see 
submitted bids go unapplied during bid 
processing. As such, OEA and WTB find 
a contingent bidding limit to be 
unnecessary, and will not include it in 
Auction 113. 
For Auction 113, OEA and WTB will 
not provide for activity rule waivers to 
preserve a bidder’s eligibility. This 
approach has been followed in every 
ascending clock auction since the 
Commission introduced the format. The 
clock auction relies on precisely 
identifying the point at which demand 
decreases to equal supply to determine 
winning bidders and final prices. 
Allowing waivers would create 
uncertainty with respect to the exact 
level of bidder demand, would reduce 
the incentives to bid sincerely, and 
would interfere with the basic clock 
price-setting and winner determination 
mechanism. Moreover, uncertainty 
about the level of demand would affect 
the way bidders’ requests to reduce 
demand are processed by the bidding 
system. Submitting proxy instructions 
can address some of the circumstances 
under which a bidder inadvertently 
risks losing bidding eligibility. 
F. Acceptable Bids 
1. Reserve Prices 
In the Auction 113 Comment Public 
Notice, OEA and WTB proposed not to establish reserve prices other than 
minimum opening bid amounts for the 
licenses being offered in Auction 113, 
reasoning that, unlike Auction 97, the 
public interest did not provide any 
specific basis for doing so in Auction 
113. However, OEA and WTB invited 
commenters that consider a reserve 
price to be in the public interest to 
describe what specific factors lead them 
to that conclusion. 
Three commenters argue that 
adopting an aggregate reserve price is 
necessary to achieve Congress’ goal of 
fully funding the Commission’s Supply 
Chain Reimbursement Program in a 
single auction, to ensure that AWS–3 
spectrum is not sold for less than it is 
worth, and to avoid subjecting Auction 
97 defaulting bidders to 
disproportionately large liabilities— 
with one commenter specifically 
advocating for the adoption of a $3.3 
billion aggregate reserve. Two other 
commenters, however, ask OEA and 
WTB to reject calls for an aggregate 
reserve price in Auction 113, arguing 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00056 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60001 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations that it is not necessary where the 
Commission is already proposing robust 
minimum opening bids that will 
prevent licenses from being assigned at 
nominal amounts. Those commenters 
further observe that an aggregate reserve 
price that is set too high could 
ultimately cause the auction to fail, 
which would in turn deprive the 
Treasury of all revenue and result in 
valuable spectrum remaining 
unlicensed and unused. 
OEA and WTB agree, and adopt their 
proposal not to establish reserve prices 
for Auction 113 licenses, other than 
minimum opening bid amounts. As the 
Commission has previously explained, 
while the primary purpose of a 
minimum opening bid is to speed up 
the course of an auction, a minimum 
opening bid also can serve a revenue- 
enhancing function like a reserve price, 
because if bids are not accepted below 
a certain level, they will also not be sold 
below that level. That is, a minimum 
opening bid effectively functions as a 
reserve price. OEA and WTB therefore 
conclude that adopting an aggregate 
reserve price is not necessary for an 
auction in which they are adopting 
minimum opening bids that are 
sufficiently high so as to prevent 
licenses from being assigned at nominal 
amounts and in which OEA and WTB 
have no statutory obligation to do so. 
Contrary to one commenter’s 
arguments, the Commission is not 
required to adopt a reserve price to 
ensure that the maximum funding 
earmarked by Congress for the 
Commission’s Supply Chain 
Reimbursement Program is fully funded 
from a single auction. OEA and WTB 
agree that Congress’s directive that 
proceeds raised in Auction 113 be used 
to support the Commission’s Supply 
Chain Reimbursement Program does not 
require that the Commission risk a 
failed auction by setting a $3.3 billion 
reserve price. If a reserve was 
established but not met, the auction 
would provide no funds at all. It is 
unreasonable to believe that Congress 
intended such a result. Moreover, in the 
Part 1 Third Report and Order, 63 FR 
2315 (January 15, 1998), 63 FR 12658 
(March 16, 1998), 63 FR 29958 (June 2, 
1998), the Commission concluded that 
47 U.S.C. 309(j)(4)(F) does not require it 
to use reserve prices or minimum 
opening bids to maximize the revenue 
earned in all future spectrum auctions 
because the other auction goals in 47 
U.S.C. 309(j)(3)—such as ensuring the 
deployment and rapid deployment of 
new technologies and services and 
promoting economic opportunity and 
competition—have not been eliminated, 
and the Commission must continue to 
balance and pursue all of its objectives. 
OEA and WTB find unavailing 
commenters’ arguments that the lack of 
a reserve price would be detrimental to 
defaulting bidders from Auction 97 and 
that setting a reserve price would help 
these defaulting bidders avoid facing 
disproportionately large liabilities in 
Auction 113. The Commission is not 
obligated to establish an aggregate 
reserve price equal to the sum of all bids 
on which bidders defaulted in Auction 
97—i.e., $3.3 billion—in order to shield past defaulting bidders from the 
consequences of their own actions and 
to protect them from any risk that they 
would be required to pay a deficiency 
payment following Auction 113. Indeed, 
bidders in a Commission auction are on 
notice that they bear any risk that may 
be associated with their winning bids, 
because the Commission’s default 
payment rules make clear that ‘‘[a] 
bidder assumes a binding obligation to 
pay its full bid amount upon acceptance 
of the winning bid at the close of an 
auction.’’ See 47 CFR 1.2104(g)(2). Those rules also make clear that if a 
bidder defaults on its winning bid, it 
will be subject to a default payment 
consisting of a deficiency payment 
equal to the difference between the 
amount of the defaulted bid amount and 
the amount of the winning bid in a 
subsequent auction, plus an additional 
default payment percentage amount. 
Setting a reserve price that would 
render the deficiency payment 
provision of the default payment 
meaningless would distort auction 
incentives and likely encourage more 
defaults in the future. 
The Commission has previously 
explained that the reserve price and 
minimum opening bid provision in 47 
U.S.C. 309(j)(4)(F) is intended to prevent 
licenses from being assigned via auction 
at nominal amounts, which could result, 
for example, from insufficient 
competition in the auction that might in 
turn be due to the inability of potential 
bidders to assess the market adequately 
or develop business plans. Moreover, 
the Commission has discretion 
regarding whether to employ a 
minimum opening bid and/or reserve 
price in an auction, after considering, 
among other factors, the amount of 
spectrum being auctioned, levels of 
incumbency, the availability of 
technology to provide service, the size 
of the geographic service areas, issues of 
interference with other spectrum bands, 
and any other relevant factors that could 
reasonably have an impact on valuation 
of the spectrum being auctioned. Given 
the circumstances in Auction 113—i.e., 
that it is an auction of licenses in 
spectrum bands that are already in use 
for 5G services, that this is the first 
auction the Commission will be 
conducting in almost four years, and 
that the licenses being offered in 
Auction 113 have been lying fallow for 
ten years during the pendency of 
litigation—OEA and WTB conclude 
these factors should be sufficient to 
ensure that there will be sufficient 
competition in the auction and that 
these licenses will not be assigned at 
nominal amounts. This will in turn 
benefit the public more than 
establishing a reserve price in the 
absence of a statutory directive to do so. 
2. Minimum Opening Bids 
As is typical for spectrum license 
auctions, OEA and WTB sought 
comment on the use of a minimum 
opening bid and/or reserve price, as 
mandated by 47 U.S.C. 309(j) of the 
Communications Act. OEA and WTB 
will establish minimum opening bids 
for every license in Auction 113. The 
bidding system will not accept bids at 
prices less than the minimum opening 
bid specified for each license. Based on 
the Commission’s experience in past 
auctions, setting appropriate minimum 
opening bids is an effective tool to 
prevent an excessive number of bidding 
rounds at very low prices. 
OEA and WTB adopt their proposed 
minimum opening bid amounts. OEA 
and WTB calculate minimum opening 
bids on a license-by-license basis based 
on $0.01 per MHz-pop for the paired 
licenses in areas with a population of 
less than 300,000, $0.02 per MHz-pop 
for the paired licenses in areas with a 
population of at least 300,000 and less 
than 1,000,000, $0.05 per MHz-pop for 
the paired licenses in areas with a 
population of at least 1,000,000, and 
$0.01 per MHz-pop for the unpaired 
licenses. For all licenses, minimum 
opening bids will be subject to a 
minimum of $1,000 per license. 
Two commenters argue the proposed 
minimum opening bids are too low and 
propose that the minimum opening bids 
for the licenses in Auction 113 not be 
lower than the minimum opening bids 
of the corresponding licenses in Auction 
97. They both argue that lower 
minimum opening bids in Auction 113 
on some licenses, relative to the 
corresponding minimum opening bids 
in Auction 97, may result in lower 
winning bids on those licenses and 
lower auction revenue. 
OEA and WTB are unconvinced by 
these arguments. As the Commission 
has recognized in past auctions, 
minimum opening bids are not intended 
to be a reflection of final license prices, 
but instead a starting point for bidding.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60002 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations The minimum opening bid on a license 
has less bearing on the final price of the 
license than it does on the number of 
rounds required to reach the final price. 
OEA and WTB also disagree that lower 
minimum opening bids on some 
licenses in Auction 113 (relative to 
Auction 97) will reduce auction 
revenue, even though other minimum 
opening bids in Auction 113 are higher 
(relative to Auction 97). In past 
auctions, the Commission has 
recognized that a critical factor in 
setting minimum opening bids is to not 
set them above the market clearing 
price, which is unknown prior to the 
auction and, if set too high, could result 
in lower participation and unsold 
licenses. Another commenter supports 
this principle, agreeing that the 
minimum opening bids OEA and WTB 
adopt will facilitate robust price 
discovery and participation. OEA and 
WTB find that the amounts they adopt 
for Auction 113 balance the competing 
objectives for minimum opening bids 
because (1) they are sufficiently low so 
as not to deter participation or interfere 
with the price-setting and winner 
determination mechanisms of the 
auction, and (2) they are sufficiently 
high so as not to result in an excessive 
number of rounds at prices very distant 
from the final prices and to not permit 
the licenses to be sold for nominal 
amounts. 
The minimum opening bids that OEA 
and WTB adopt for the midband AWS– 
3 spectrum licenses available in Auction 
113 are in line with the minimum 
opening bids that have been set for 
every recent auction of mid-band 
spectrum. In Auction 110 for licenses in 
the 3.45–3.55 GHz band, the minimum 
opening bids were calculated based on 
$0.02 or $0.06 per MHz-pop, according 
to the population tiers of the geographic 
area. In Auction 108 for licenses in the 
2.5 GHz band, the minimum opening 
bids were calculated based on $0.006 
per MHz-pop for all licenses. In Auction 
107 for licenses in the 3.7–3.98 GHz 
band, the minimum opening bids were 
calculated based on $0.003, $0.006 or 
$0.03 per MHz-pop, according to the 
population tiers of the geographic area. 
In Auction 105 for licenses in the 3.55– 
3.65 GHz band, the minimum opening 
bids were calculated based on $0.02 per 
MHz-pop for all licenses. Commenters 
have not presented any evidence that 
there have been changes to the market 
conditions for 5G-suitable spectrum that 
could justify increasing the minimum 
opening bids for Auction 113 above the 
range of minimum opening bids found 
in these four auctions of midband 
spectrum. OEA and WTB find that this 
range of minimum opening bids better 
reflects current market conditions than 
the minimum opening bids that were 
used in Auction 97. 
One commenter suggests 
implementing the use of ‘‘adaptive 
pricing mechanisms’’ that would 
decrease minimum opening bids during 
the auction for licenses that do not 
receive any bids at the current 
minimum opening bids. OEA and WTB 
do not believe that this approach would 
be helpful to bidders in Auction 113. No 
commenters submitted evidence 
demonstrating that the specific 
minimum opening bids OEA and WTB 
proposed for Auction 113 are too high. 
The minimum opening bids OEA and 
WTB adopt in Auction 113 use a lower 
dollar-per-MHz-pop basis in areas with 
lower populations than in areas with 
higher populations, reducing the risk of 
licenses in rural areas going unsold. The 
number of licenses unsold in recent 
auctions has been relatively small, 
suggesting that minimum opening bids 
have not been set inappropriately high. 
In Auction 110, 0.5% of licenses were 
not sold; in Auction 108, 1.8% of 
licenses were not sold; in Auction 107, 
there were no unsold licenses; and in 
Auction 105, 8.9% of licenses were not 
sold. Furthermore, OEA and WTB have 
concerns that introducing a feature into 
the bidding system to reduce certain 
minimum opening bids ‘‘for licenses 
that receive no bids after a defined 
number of rounds’’ could introduce 
additional complexity into bidding 
strategies and could run counter to the 
objective of not permitting licenses to be 
sold for nominal amounts. Therefore, 
OEA and WTB decline to implement 
this suggestion. 
The minimum opening bids for all 
licenses offered in Auction 113 are set 
forth in the Attachment A file on the 
Auction 113 website at www.fcc.gov/ 
auction/113. 
3. Clock Price Increments 
OEA and WTB adopt the procedures 
regarding clock price increments as 
described in the Auction 113 Comment 
Public Notice. Therefore, after bidding 
in the first round and before each 
subsequent round, for each license, the 
bidding system will announce the start- 
of-round price and the clock price for 
the upcoming round—that is, the lowest 
price and the highest price at which 
bidders can submit bids during the 
round. As long as aggregate demand for 
the license at the clock price exceeds 
one, the start-of-round price for the 
upcoming round will be equal to the 
clock price from the prior round. If 
aggregate demand equaled one at a price 
in the previous round, then the start-of- 
round price for the next round will be 
equal to the price at which demand 
equaled one. If aggregate demand was 
zero in the previous round, then the 
start-of-round price for the next round 
will remain the same. 
OEA and WTB will set the clock price 
for a license for a round by adding a 
percentage increment to the start-of- 
round price. OEA and WTB will set the 
initial increment percentage at 10%, 
and OEA may adjust this increment 
percentage within a range of 5% to 30%, 
inclusive, in later rounds. To ensure 
that an increase in the percentage 
increment does not result in an unduly 
large increase for a license, the total 
dollar amount of the increment (the 
difference between the clock price and 
the start-of-round price) will be capped 
at a certain amount. OEA and WTB will 
set this cap on the increment initially at 
$50 million, and OEA may adjust the 
cap in later rounds. The 5% to 30% 
increment range and cap will allow us 
to manage the auction pace and take 
into account bidders’ needs to 
reevaluate their bidding strategies while 
also moving the auction along quickly. 
4. Bid Types 
Under the clock-1 auction format 
adopted for Auction 113, a bidder will 
indicate in each round the licenses it 
demands at the prices associated with 
the round. A ‘‘simple’’ bid indicates a 
desired quantity (in this auction, one or 
zero) at a price. In the first round, a 
bidder indicates the licenses it demands 
at the minimum opening bids by 
indicating a quantity of one for each of 
those licenses. After the first round, a 
bidder that wants to maintain the same 
processed demand for a license at the 
new clock price would submit a bid for 
the license at the clock price, indicating 
that it is willing to pay up to that price, 
if need be, for the license. A bid to 
maintain the same processed demand 
cannot be at a price less than the clock 
price. 
OEA and WTB will not permit a 
‘‘switch’’ bid to reduce demand for one 
license in a market and increase 
demand for another license in the same 
market in Auction 113. OEA and WTB 
did not receive any comments on this 
issue. The inventory of licenses for 
Auction 113 contains only one market 
in which there are multiple licenses that 
may be considered similar, thus the 
additional bidding and system 
complexity necessary to permit switch 
bidding in this market is not 
worthwhile. A bidder that wants to bid 
on both licenses within the market that 
has two licenses could bid on these two 
licenses separately.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60003 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations 5. Intra-Round Bids 
After the first round, bids to change 
demand can be made at prices between 
the start-of-round price and the clock 
price. These are known as intra-round 
bids. A bidder will be permitted to make 
intra-round bids by indicating the 
quantity it demands for the license (in 
this auction, one or zero) and a price 
between the start-of-round price and the 
clock price at which it wants to change 
its demand. For example, if a bidder has 
processed demand for a license at the 
start-of-round price of $200, but no 
longer wants the license if the price 
increases by more than $10, the bidder 
would indicate a bid quantity of zero at 
a price of $210. Similarly, if the bidder 
wishes to reduce its demand to zero if 
the price increases at all above $200, the 
bidder would indicate a bid quantity of 
zero at the start-of-round price of $200. 
Permitting intra-round bids allows the 
bidding system to use relatively large 
clock price increments, because bidders 
can submit bids at prices lower than the 
clock prices. This may reduce the 
number of rounds in the auction 
without increasing the risk that a large 
clock price increment will prevent the 
auction from accurately determining the 
market clearing price, at which only one 
bidder demands the license. 
Intra-round bid amounts will be 
limited to multiples of $10 for prices 
below $10,000; to multiples of $100 for 
prices between $10,000 and $100,000, 
inclusive; and to multiples of $1,000 for 
prices above $100,000. OEA and WTB 
limit intra-round bids to these multiples 
to deter anti-competitive strategic 
bidding. 
6. Proxy Bids 
OEA and WTB adopt their proposal, 
which is supported by the record, to 
make proxy bidding an option available 
to bidders in Auction 113. In the first 
round, a bidder may submit a proxy 
instruction to the bidding system for 
any license for which it submits a bid 
in the first round. After the first round, 
a bidder may submit a proxy instruction 
to the bidding system for any license for 
which it has processed demand. A 
proxy instruction for a license must 
indicate a reduction in demand for the 
license to zero at a price higher than the 
current round’s clock price. Proxy 
instructions to increase a bidder’s 
demand for a license at a given price 
will not be permitted. 
Under the procedures OEA and WTB 
adopt here, if a proxy instruction has 
been submitted, the bidding system will 
automatically submit a proxy bid to 
maintain the bidder’s demand for the 
license in every subsequent round as 
long as the clock price for the round is 
less than the proxy instruction price. In 
the first round in which the clock price 
is greater than or equal to the proxy 
instruction price, the bidding system 
will submit a proxy bid on behalf of the 
bidder to reduce the bidder’s demand 
for that license to zero at the proxy 
instruction price. For example, if a 
bidder has processed demand for a 
license with a clock price of $1,000, and 
the bidder is willing to purchase the 
license for a price up to $1,800, the 
bidder could submit a proxy instruction 
to reduce its demand for the license to 
0 at $1,800. In that case, the bidding 
system will submit proxy bids to 
maintain the bidder’s demand for the 
license in each subsequent round as 
long as the clock price is less than 
$1,800. In a round in which the clock 
price is above $1,800, the bidding 
system will submit a proxy bid to 
reduce the bidder’s demand for the 
license to zero at the price of $1,800. 
In the case that a bid to reduce 
demand, whether placed according to 
proxy instructions or submitted by the 
bidder in the round, is not applied 
during bid processing, the bidding 
system will automatically generate a 
proxy instruction at the bid price and, 
in the following rounds, submit proxy 
bids on behalf of the bidder according 
to that proxy instruction. For example, 
suppose that the start-of-round price for 
a license is $10,000, the clock price is 
$12,000, and a bidder with processed 
demand for the license submits a bid to 
reduce its demand to 0 at price $11,500. 
If the bid is not applied during bid 
processing (e.g., because there were no other bids for the license in the round), 
in the following round the bidding 
system will submit a proxy bid on 
behalf of the bidder to reduce demand 
for the license to 0 at price $11,500. The 
proxy instruction preserves in the 
bidding system the bidder’s interest in 
retaining demand for the license only if 
the price is no higher than $11,500, 
which may help avoid having the 
license sold later in the auction to 
another bidder at a price less than what 
the initial bidder would be willing to 
pay. 
In any round, a bidder can remove or 
modify any existing proxy instructions 
or proxy bids for the round by 
submitting new bids through the user 
interface or file upload. The system will 
take the last bid submission as that 
bidder’s bids and proxy instructions. 
Bidders are reminded that any bids 
submitted through an upload will 
replace all bids and proxy instructions 
previously submitted. 
As is the case for intra-round bid 
amounts, proxy instruction prices will 
be limited to multiples of $10 for prices 
below $10,000; to multiples of $100 for 
prices between $10,000 and $100,000, 
inclusive; and to multiples of $1,000 for 
prices above $100,000. Proxy 
instructions will not be publicly 
released either during or after the 
auction. 
Commenters agree that proxy bidding 
as proposed in the Auction 113 
Comment Public Notice alleviates the 
burden and resources required to 
monitor a multiple-round auction. One 
commenter states that proxy bidding 
will also promote more efficient auction 
outcomes by reducing the risk of 
erroneous bids and allowing for more 
efficient use of bidder resources. 
Another commenter supports allowing 
proxy bidding, but suggests that OEA 
and WTB consider introducing 
conditional proxy bid increases in 
demand to allow a bidder to instruct the 
bidding system to bid on an additional 
license if its price falls below a certain 
level, claiming this approach would 
help bidders navigate the complexities 
of managing multiple licenses. 
OEA and WTB conclude that adopting 
this commenter’s proposal is 
unnecessary in an ascending clock 
auction because the posted prices and 
start-of-round prices never decrease 
from one round to the next. In the 
ascending clock auction managing 
substitutions between multiple licenses 
is already possible, for instance, by 
placing a bid to decrease demand on 
one license, and, if the bid to reduce 
demand is processed, placing a bid to 
increase demand for another license that 
has the same or fewer bidding units as 
the former license. This type of 
substitution does not require a proxy 
bid to increase demand. Proxy bids are 
not intended to relieve bidders of their 
responsibility to manage their bidding 
eligibility or to actively follow round-to- 
round changes in prices and aggregate 
demand. Furthermore, in the ascending 
clock auction, once a bidder has 
processed demand for a license, the 
bidder cannot ensure or guarantee that 
it will not win the license when the 
auction closes. Similarly, a bidder 
cannot ensure or guarantee that the 
price of a license will not continue to 
rise in future rounds, or that the relative 
price of a license compared to another 
license will not change in future rounds. 
7. Missing Bids 
Under the clock-1 auction format, if a 
bidder does not submit bids in the 
current round for all of the licenses for 
which it had processed demand in the 
previous round and does not have proxy 
instructions in place, the bidding 
system will consider those licenses to 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60004 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations have missing bids. Missing bids are 
treated by the bidding system as 
requests to reduce demand to zero at the 
start-of-round prices for the licenses 
with missing bids. If these requests are 
applied, then a bidder’s bidding 
activity, and its bidding eligibility for 
the next round, may be reduced. A 
bidder can avoid having missing bids by 
either indicating its demand in every 
round or by entering appropriate proxy 
instructions. 
G. Bid Processing 
OEA and WTB adopt bid processing 
procedures that the bidding system will 
use after each round of bidding to 
process bids to change demand, to 
determine the processed demand of 
each bidder for each license, and to 
determine the posted price for each 
license that will serve as the start-of- 
round price for the next round. Bids to 
maintain demand will always be 
applied by the bidding system during 
bid processing. 
1. No Excess Supply Rule for Bids To 
Reduce Demand 
Under the clock-1 auction format, the 
bidding system will not allow a bidder 
to reduce its demand for a license if the 
reduction would cause aggregate 
demand to fall below one (the ‘‘no 
excess supply’’ rule). Therefore, if a 
bidder submits a bid to reduce its 
demand from one to zero for a license 
if the price should increase above the 
price in its bid, the bidding system will 
treat the bid as a request to reduce 
demand that will be applied only if the 
no excess supply rule would be 
satisfied. 
OEA and WTB adopt the no excess 
supply rule for Auction 113. The no 
excess supply rule has been integral to 
the success of the clock auction since 
the clock auction was introduced at the 
Commission in the Broadcast Incentive 
Auction. One commenter proposes to 
introduce exceptions to the no excess 
supply rule, claiming it has created 
barriers for bidders in past auctions, but 
provides no examples to support this 
claim, which is counterintuitive on its 
face. The purpose of not allowing the 
use of withdrawals and proactive 
waivers in a clock auction is to reduce 
complexity and uncertainty about 
bidder demand for spectrum. The clock 
auction relies on identifying the point at 
which demand decreases to equal 
supply to determine prices. Allowing 
withdrawals, proactive waivers, or 
exceptions to the no excess supply rule 
would create uncertainty with respect to 
the exact level of bidder demand and 
would interfere with the basic clock 
price-setting and winner determination 
mechanism. The no excess supply rule 
ensures that once there is demand for a 
license that the license will not then go 
unsold. The no excess supply rule 
makes it risky or costly for a bidder to 
engage in gamesmanship by increasing 
its demand for a license in one round, 
potentially causing the price of the 
license to increase for another bidder, 
and then reducing its demand for the 
license in a subsequent round. OEA and 
WTB agree that they should not 
introduce exceptions that are contrary to 
the underlying purpose of the rules, 
which is to protect the integrity of the 
auction. 
2. Eligibility Rule for Bids To Increase 
Demand 
The bidding system will not allow a 
bidder to increase its demand for a 
license if the total number of bidding 
units associated with all of the bidder’s 
license demands exceeds the bidder’s 
eligibility for the round. Therefore, if a 
bidder submits a bid to add a license for 
which it did not have processed 
demand in the previous round, the 
bidding system will treat the bid as a 
request to increase demand that will be 
applied only if it would not cause the 
bidder’s processed activity to exceed its 
eligibility. 
3. Processed Demand 
OEA and WTB adopt the procedures 
described in the Auction 113 Comment 
Public Notice to determine the order in 
which the bidding system will process 
bids after a round ends. After a round 
ends, the bidding system will first 
consider and apply all bids to maintain 
demand at the clock price, and then it 
will process bids to change demand in 
order of price point, where the price 
point represents the percentage of the 
distance between the bid price and the 
start-of-round price, relative to the 
distance between the clock price and 
the start-of-round price. The bidding 
system will process bids to change 
demand in ascending order of price 
point across all licenses and all bidders, 
first by considering intra-round bids in 
order of price point and then, finally, 
bids at the clock price (i.e., bids with a price point equal to 100%). As it 
considers each submitted bid during bid 
processing, the bidding system will 
determine whether there is excess 
demand for a license at that point in the 
processing in order to determine 
whether a bidder’s request to reduce 
demand for that license can be applied. 
Likewise, the bidding system will 
evaluate the activity associated with the 
bidder’s most recently determined 
demands at that point in the processing 
to determine whether a request to 
increase demand can be applied. 
If a bid can be applied, the licenses 
that the bidder holds at that point in the 
processing would be adjusted, and 
aggregate demand for the license would 
be recalculated accordingly. If the bid 
cannot be applied, the unfulfilled bid 
will be held in a queue, to be considered 
later during the current round’s bid 
processing. The bidding system will 
then consider the bid submitted at the 
next lowest price point, and given the 
most recently determined demands of 
bidders, see if the bid can be applied. 
Note that the price point at which a bid 
is considered by the bidding system can 
affect whether the bid is applied, 
because at any given price point some 
bidders may request to increase demand 
for licenses while others may request 
reductions. 
Every time a bid is applied, the 
unfulfilled bids held in the queue will 
be reconsidered, in the order of their 
price points. Bids that were not applied 
because demand would fall below one 
or because the bidder’s processed 
activity would exceed its eligibility will 
be considered, again in price point 
order, if there should be excess demand 
or if the bidder’s processed activity is 
reduced sufficiently later in the 
processing after other bids are 
processed. 
This step of bid processing will 
conclude when all bids from the round 
have been processed and no unfulfilled 
bids held in the queue can be applied. 
The bidding system will then 
automatically generate a proxy 
instruction for each bid to reduce 
demand that was not applied. However, 
the bidding system will not carry over 
to the next round unfulfilled bid 
requests to increase demand. The 
bidding system will advise bidders 
about whether their bids were applied 
when round results are released. 
4. Price Determination 
As described in the Auction 113 
Comment Public Notice, the bidding 
system further will determine, based on 
aggregate demand, the posted price for 
each license for the round, with a 
license’s posted price serving as its 
start-of-round price for the next round. 
The price for a license will increase 
from round to round as long as there is 
excess demand for the license, but will 
not increase if either no bidder demands 
the license or if only a single bidder 
demands the license. 
If, at the end of a round, aggregate 
demand for a license exceeds the supply 
of one, the posted price will equal the 
clock price for the round. If a reduction 
in demand was applied during the 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60005 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations round and caused demand for a license 
to fall to one, the posted price will be 
the highest price at which a reduction 
was applied for that license. If aggregate 
demand is zero, or if aggregate demand 
is one and no bid to reduce demand was 
applied for the license, then the posted 
price will equal the start-of-round price 
for the round. The range of acceptable 
bid amounts for the next round will be 
set by adding the percentage increment 
to the posted price. 
Under the clock-1 auction format, if a 
bid to reduce demand is not applied, it 
is because there is no excess demand for 
the license and, therefore, the posted 
price will not increase. Hence, the 
posted price for a license will not be 
higher than the bid price of a bidder that 
makes a bid to reduce demand that 
cannot be applied. 
After the bids of the round have been 
processed, if the stopping rule has not 
been met, the bidding system will 
announce clock prices to indicate a 
range of acceptable bids for the next 
round. Each bidder will be informed of 
the licenses for which it has processed 
demand and of the aggregate demand for 
each license. 
5. Caps on Bidding Credits 
Eligible applicants claiming either a 
small business or rural service provider 
bidding credit will be subject to 
specified caps on the total bidding 
credit discount that they may receive. 
For Auction 113, OEA and WTB adopt 
the bidding credit caps at the amounts 
proposed for the reasons discussed in 
the Auction 113 Comment Public Notice. Specifically, OEA and WTB adopt a $25 million cap on the total 
bidding credit discount that may be 
awarded to an eligible small business, 
and a $10 million cap on the total 
bidding credit discount that may be 
awarded to an eligible rural service 
provider in Auction 113. Additionally, 
to create parity among eligible small 
businesses and rural service providers 
competing against each other in smaller 
markets, no winning designated entity 
bidder may receive more than $10 
million in bidding credit discounts in 
total for licenses won in markets with a 
population of 500,000 or fewer. 
Two commenters argue against 
adopting bidding credit caps in Auction 
113. The Commission’s part 1 rules, 
however, require a cap on a winning bid 
discount that will be offered to small 
businesses and rural service providers. 
See 47 CFR 1.2110(f)(2)(ii), (4)(ii). Amendments to those rules require a 
rulemaking proceeding and cannot be 
done in the context of establishing the 
procedures for Auction 113 because 
such action is outside the scope of 
OEA’s and WTB’s delegated authority. 
The record supports adopting the 
small business bidding credit cap and 
rural service bidding credit cap for 
Auction 113 at the amounts proposed, 
and OEA and WTB find this consistent 
with the Commission’s decisions in 
recent spectrum auctions. In the 2015 
Updating Part 1 Report and Order, the 
Commission adopted small business 
and rural service provider bidding 
credit caps and established the 
parameters for implementing such 
bidding credit caps in a given auction 
based on an evaluation of the expected 
capital requirements presented by the 
specific service and the inventory of 
licenses to be auctioned. The 
Commission’s rules provide for a small 
business bidding credit cap of not less 
than $25 million and a rural service 
provider bidding credit of not less than 
$10 million, to be determined on an 
auction-by-auction basis. 
Under the parameters established in 
the 2015 Updating Part 1 Report Order, 
OEA and WTB find that a $25 million 
small business bidding credit cap for 
Auction 113 is appropriate because this 
is an auction of a limited number of 
AWS–3 licenses and the expected 
capital requirements associated with 
these AWS–3 licenses are not likely to 
be any higher than those for bands 
where OEA and WTB adopted the same 
$25 million cap, given that many 
providers have already cleared, 
standardized, deployed, and offer 
service using other licenses in the same 
bands. 
Some commenters disagree with this 
approach. One commenter, for example, 
proposes that the Commission increase 
the bidding credit caps to account for 
inflation, noting that a decade has 
passed since Auction 97 and, 
‘‘according to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, $25 million in November 
2014 dollars would be worth more than 
$33 million today.’’ However, recent 
auction data demonstrate that a $25 
million cap on small business bidding 
credits has allowed a substantial 
majority of eligible small businesses to 
take advantage of the bidding credit 
program and be unaffected by the cap. 
Whatever the impact of inflation 
generally, OEA and WTB see no 
persuasive evidence that a $25 million 
cap would impair the meaningful 
opportunity that the bidding credit 
provides for small businesses to 
participate in Auction 113. 
One commenter argues that, in 
proposing to apply a $25 million small 
business bidding credit cap, the ‘‘lens 
through which [OEA and WTB view] 
small business participation in Auction 
113’’ is ‘‘out of focus’’ and OEA and 
WTB should instead draw on the results 
of Auction 97 to assess the capital 
requirements for Auction 113. This 
commenter reasons that the Auction 97 
results demonstrate that a $25 million 
small business bidding credit cap is 
‘‘untenable,’’ because Northstar 
Wireless, LLC (Northstar) and SNR 
Wireless LicenseCo, LLC (SNR) placed 
$3.4 billion in winning bids for 197 of 
the licenses available in Auction 113, 
with the expectation that they would be 
eligible for $859 million in bidding 
credits. OEA and WTB find this 
argument meritless inasmuch as the 
Commission’s very purpose in requiring 
the implementation of a minimum small 
business bidding credit cap in all 
auctions that offer such a credit is to 
safeguard against the use of bidding 
credits by entities that are not bona fide 
small businesses, such as the applicants 
that were denied bidding credits in 
Auction 97. The fact that a bidder 
claiming eligibility for bidding credits 
in Auction 97 could have bid with an 
expectation of receiving close to $1 
billion in bidding discounts, as 
Northstar and SNR did, illustrates why 
the Commission established a cap on 
bidding credits that is reasonably 
proportional to the capital expenditures 
for spectrum licenses likely needed by 
bona fide small businesses, as well as 
the appropriateness of the caps set in 
the Commission’s most recent auctions. 
Moreover, applying a reasonable 
bidding credit cap in Auction 97 such 
as the one OEA and WTB adopt for 
Auction 113 would have substantially 
lessened the financial impact of SNR’s 
and Northstar’s being found ineligible 
for the bidding credits that they 
claimed, and perhaps they would not 
have had the incentive to bid, in 
aggregate, so much more than they were 
ultimately willing to pay. As the 
Commission concluded in the 2015 
Updating Part 1 Report Order, a $25 
million bidding credit cap provides a 
significant benefit to the vast majority of 
bona fide small businesses that may 
participate in Auction 113, particularly 
since applying the cap would allow a 
bidder eligible for a 25% discount to 
receive that discount on gross bids of up 
to $100 million. 
Nor are OEA and WTB persuaded by 
a commenter’s proposal to introduce 
more complex bidding credit caps such 
as regional bidding credit caps that are 
a function of regional spectrum values, 
population density, median income, or 
broadband access disparities. Because 
the $25 million bidding credit cap in 
recent auctions allowed the substantial 
majority of small business to realize the 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00061 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60006 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations full value of their bidding credit based 
on their gross winning bid amounts, 
OEA and WTB find it unnecessary to 
introduce other bidding credit caps in 
some regions that would increase 
complexity, make it more likely that a 
small business would be limited by 
some regional cap, and could create 
issues for bidders and the bidding 
system as a result of regional borders. 
Based on the Commission’s 
experience in its spectrum auctions, 
OEA and WTB also find a $10 million 
rural service provider bidding credit cap 
is appropriate because, as the 
Commission explained in the 2015 
Updating Part 1 Report and Order, a 
rural service provider’s approach to 
bidding is generally more targeted and 
usually focuses on competing for a few 
select license areas that align with its 
existing service territory or adjacent 
areas. 
Lastly, OEA and WTB find that a $10 
million cap on the overall bidding credit 
amount that any winning small business 
bidder may apply to licenses won in 
small markets is appropriate based on 
the Commission’s conclusions in the 
2015 Updating Part 1 Report and Order. This is consistent with the approach 
adopted in all of the Commission’s 
spectrum actions beginning with the 
Broadcast Incentive Auction and strikes 
a measured and reasonable balance to 
protect against abuse of the designated 
entity program while also allowing large 
designated entities a higher cap in large 
service areas. One commenter proposes 
that rather than capping the bidding 
credits used by a designated entity for 
particular small markets based on 
population, OEA and WTB cap the 
bidding credits for rural service 
providers at the same level as that for 
small businesses. After considering the 
purpose and benefits of a rural service 
provider bidding credit, the 
Commission concluded in the 2015 
Updating Part 1 Report and Order that 
rural service providers did not warrant 
as high a bidding credit as other 
designated entities. Given the different 
nature of their business plans and 
financial resources, it concluded that 
different bidding credit caps, and the 
methodology for implementing them in 
the Broadcast Incentive Auction, were 
warranted for small businesses and rural 
service providers. These different caps 
have been maintained for auctions 
subsequent to the Broadcast Incentive 
Auction. This commenter provides no 
evidence to support a finding that a 
different conclusion would be 
appropriate with respect to the AWS–3 
licenses remaining in the Commission’s 
spectrum inventory. 
OEA and WTB conclude that the 
adoption of these caps on the overall 
amount of bidding credits offered in 
Auction 113 serves the Commission’s 
statutory goals by awarding meaningful 
opportunities to bona fide small 
businesses and eligible rural service 
providers, while preventing unjust 
enrichment and ensuring efficient and 
intensive use of spectrum. Notably, by 
adopting these caps for Auction 113, 
OEA and WTB will provide an 
important additional safeguard, as the 
Commission intended, to prevent 
ineligible entities from undercutting the 
Commission’s rules in a manner similar 
to circumstances of Auction 97. This 
approach is simple and straightforward 
to implement and will not impose an 
artificial restriction on the amount 
eligible small businesses and rural 
service providers are likely to bid. 
6. Winning Bids 
Under the clock-1 auction format, a 
bidder with processed demand for a 
license at the time the stopping rule is 
met will become the winning bidder for 
the license. The final price for a license 
will be the posted price for the final 
round. 
VI. Post-Auction Procedures 
The public notice announcing the 
close of the bidding and auction results 
will be released within several days 
after bidding has ended in Auction 113. 
This public notice will also establish the 
deadlines for submitting down 
payments, final payments, and the long- 
form applications (FCC Form 601) for 
the auction. 
A. Down Payments 
The Commission’s rules provide that, 
unless otherwise specified by public 
notice, within 10 business days after the 
release of the auction closing public 
notice for Auction 113, each winning 
bidder must submit sufficient funds (in 
addition to its upfront payment) to bring 
its total amount of money on deposit 
with the Commission to 20% of the net 
amount of its winning bids (less any 
bidding credits, if applicable). 
B. Final Payments 
The Commission’s rules provide that 
each winning bidder must submit the 
balance of the net amount for each of its 
winning bids within 10 business days 
after the deadline for submitting down 
payments. 
C. Long-Form Application (FCC Form 
601) 
The Commission’s rules provide that, 
within 10 business days after release of 
the auction closing public notice, 
winning bidders must electronically 
submit a properly completed post- 
auction long-form application (FCC 
Form 601), including the applicable 
filing fee prescribed in 47 CFR 1.1102, 
for the license(s) they won through the 
auction. 
A winning bidder claiming eligibility 
for a small business bidding credit or a 
rural service provider bidding credit 
must demonstrate its eligibility for the 
bidding credit sought in its FCC Form 
601. Further instructions on these and 
other filing requirements will be 
provided to winning bidders in the 
auction closing public notice for 
Auction 113. 
A winning bidder will also be 
required to provide as part of its long- 
form application any agreement or 
arrangement it has entered into and a 
summary of the specific terms, 
conditions, and parties involved in any 
agreement it has entered into. This 
applies to any bidding consortia, joint 
venture, partnership, or agreement, 
understanding, or other arrangement 
entered into relating to the competitive 
bidding process, including any 
agreement relating to the post-auction 
market structure. Failure to comply with 
the Commission’s rules can result in 
enforcement action. 
A winning bidder organized as 
bidding consortium must comply with 
the long-from application procedures set 
forth in 47 CFR 1.2107(g). Specifically, 
license(s) won by a consortium must be 
applied for as follows: (a) an individual 
member of the consortium or a new 
legal entity comprising two or more 
individual consortium members must 
file for licenses covered by the winning 
bids; (b) each member or group of 
members of a winning consortium 
seeking separate licenses will be 
required to file a separate FCC Form 601 
for its/their respective license(s) in their 
legal business name; (c) in the case of 
a license to be partitioned or 
disaggregated, the member or group 
filing the applicable FCC Form 601 shall 
include the parties’ partitioning or 
disaggregation agreement with the FCC 
Form 601; and (d) if a designated entity 
credit is sought (either small business or 
rural service provider), the applicant 
must meet the applicable eligibility 
requirements in the Commission’s rules 
for the credit. 
D. Ownership Disclosure Information 
Report (FCC Form 602) 
Within 10 business days after the 
release of the Auction 113 Closing 
Public Notice, each winning bidder 
must also comply with the ownership 
reporting requirements in 47 CFR 1.913, 
1.919, and 1.2112 by submitting an 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00062 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60007 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations ownership disclosure information report 
for wireless telecommunications 
services (FCC Form 602) with its FCC 
Form 601. 
If a winning bidder already has a 
complete and accurate FCC Form 602 on 
file in the FCC’s Universal Licensing 
System (ULS), then it is not necessary 
to file a new report, but the winning 
bidder must certify in its FCC Form 601 
that the information on file with the 
Commission is complete and accurate. If 
the winning bidder does not have an 
FCC Form 602 on file, or if the form on 
file is not complete and accurate, then 
the winning bidder must submit a new 
one. 
When a winning bidder submits an 
FCC Form 175, ULS automatically 
creates an ownership record. This 
record is not an FCC Form 602, but it 
may be used to pre-fill the FCC Form 
602 with the ownership information 
submitted on the winning bidder’s FCC 
Form 175 application. A winning bidder 
must review the pre-filled information 
and confirm that it is complete and 
accurate as of the filing date of the FCC 
Form 601 before certifying and 
submitting the FCC Form 602. Further 
instructions will be provided to winning 
bidders in the Auction 113 Closing 
Public Notice. 
E. Tribal Lands Bidding Credit 
A winning bidder that intends to use 
its license(s) to deploy facilities and 
provide services to qualifying Tribal 
lands that have a wireline penetration 
rate equal to or below 85% may be 
eligible to receive a Tribal lands bidding 
credit as set forth in 47 CFR 1.2107 and 
1.2110(f). A Tribal lands bidding credit 
is in addition to, and separate from, any 
other bidding credit for which a 
winning bidder may qualify. 
Unlike other bidding credits that are 
requested prior to an auction, a winning 
bidder applies for a Tribal lands bidding 
credit after the auction when it files its 
FCC Form 601. When initially filing its 
FCC Form 601, the winning bidder will 
be required to advise the Commission 
whether it intends to seek a Tribal lands 
bidding credit, for each license won in 
a particular auction, by checking the 
designated box(es). After stating its 
intent to seek a Tribal lands bidding 
credit, the winning bidder will have 180 
days from the close of the applicable 
long-form application filing deadline 
within which to amend its application 
to select the specific qualifying Tribal 
lands to be served and provide the 
required Tribal government 
certifications. A licensee receiving a 
Tribal lands bidding credit is subject to 
performance criteria as set forth in 47 
CFR 1.2110(f)(3)(vii). For additional 
information on the Tribal lands bidding 
credit, including how the amount of the 
credit is calculated, applicants should 
review the Commission’s rulemaking 
proceeding regarding Tribal lands 
bidding credits and related public 
notices. 
F. Default and Disqualification 
Any winning bidder that defaults or is 
disqualified after the close of an auction 
(i.e., fails to remit the required down payment by the specified deadline, fails 
to submit a timely long-form 
application, fails to make a full and 
timely final payment, or is otherwise 
disqualified) is liable for default 
payments as described in 47 CFR 
1.2104(g)(2). A default payment consists 
of a deficiency payment, equal to the 
difference between the amount of the 
bidder’s winning bid and the amount of 
the winning bid the next time a license 
covering the same spectrum is won in 
an auction, plus an additional payment 
equal to a percentage of the defaulter’s 
bid or of the subsequent winning bid, 
whichever is less. 
The Commission’s rules provide that, 
in advance of each auction, it will 
establish a percentage between 3% and 
20% of the applicable winning bid to be 
assessed as an additional default 
payment. As the Commission has 
indicated, the level of this additional 
payment in each auction will be based 
on the nature of the service and the 
licenses being offered. In the Auction 
113 Comment Public Notice, OEA and 
WTB proposed to set the additional 
default payment for Auction 113 at 15% 
of the applicable bid for winning bids. 
One commenter, however, opposes the 
proposed 15% additional default 
payment percentage, arguing instead 
that OEA and WTB should implement 
the maximum default payment 
percentage of 20% to ensure that 
defaults that occurred in Auction 97 are 
not repeated. Another commenter 
opposes this request, claiming that it is 
designed to discourage competitor 
participation in Auction 113. 
As the Commission has previously 
emphasized, defaults weaken the 
integrity of the auction process and may 
impede the deployment of service to the 
public. Due to prior defaults, the AWS– 
3 spectrum being offered in Auction 113 
has been in the Commission’s inventory 
for a full decade after it was first offered 
in Auction 97. OEA and WTB therefore 
agree that it is important to take steps 
to minimize the chance of defaults on 
winning bids in this auction. OEA and 
WTB disagree with the assertion that 
implementing a 20% additional default 
payment would serve only to discourage 
participation in the auction. This 
commenter does not explain how 
adopting a higher additional default 
payment to discourage insincere 
bidding and defaults by bidders who are 
unable to pay their full bid amount 
would discourage bidding by sincere 
bidders who have adequate financing to 
pay their full bids. And in any case, 
whatever deterrent effect the higher 
default payment amount may or may 
not have would be outweighed by the 
public interest in encouraging only 
sincere bidding. OEA and WTB 
conclude that a higher additional 
default payment will be more effective 
in deterring defaults in Auction 113 and 
therefore adopt the maximum additional 
default payment percentage of 20% for 
this auction. 
Finally, in the event of a default, the 
Commission has the discretion to re- 
auction the license or offer it to the next 
highest bidder (in descending order) at 
its final bid amount. In addition, if a 
default or disqualification involves 
gross misconduct, misrepresentation, or 
bad faith by an applicant, then the 
Commission may declare the applicant 
and its principals ineligible to bid in 
future auctions and may take any other 
action that it deems necessary, 
including institution of proceedings to 
revoke any existing authorizations held 
by the applicant. 
G. Refund of Remaining Upfront 
Payment Balance 
If a bidder is due a refund, the bidder 
must request a refund in writing with 
the information listed below. All 
refunds of upfront payment balances 
will be returned to the payer of record 
as identified on the FCC Form 159, or 
on the wire transfer, unless the payer 
submits written authorization 
instructing otherwise. Bidders are 
encouraged to use the Refund icon 
found in the Review or Modify Existing 
Applications table on the FRN Selection screen or the Refund Form link 
available on the Auction Application 
Submit Confirmation page in the AAP to 
access the form. After the required 
information is completed on the blank 
form, the form should be printed and 
signed, and submitted to the 
Commission by fax or email. 
If you have elected not to access the 
Refund Form, the Commission is 
requesting that all of the following 
information be supplied in writing:

VII. Procedural Matters 
A. Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis 
The Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) has approved the information 
collections in the Application to 
Participate in an FCC Auction, FCC 
Form 175. Th Auction 113 Procedures 
Public Notice does not contain new or 
substantively modified information 
collection requirements subject to the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(PRA), Public Law 104–13. Therefore, it 
does not contain any new or modified 
information collection burden for small 
business concerns with fewer than 25 
employees pursuant to the Small 
Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, 
Public Law 107–198. The Commission 
will be submitting a non-substantive 
change request to OMB concerning 
OMB 3060–0600 related to the 
certification requirement and the 
acknowledgment statement for Auction 
113 applicants adopted in the Auction 
113 Procedures Public Notice, and the 
Commission will not require Auction 
113 applicants to make this certification 
or submit the acknowledgement 
statement in FCC Form 175 until OMB 
has approved the non-substantive 
change request. 
B. Congressional Review Act 
The Commission has determined, and 
Administrator of the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs, 
Office of Management and Budget, 
concurs, that this rule is ‘‘non-major’’ 
under the Congressional Review Act, 5 
U.S.C. 804(2). The Commission will 
send a copy of the Auction 113 
Procedures Public Notice to Congress 
and the Government Accountability 
Office pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 801(a)(1)(A). 
C. Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
As required by the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended 
(RFA), OEA and WTB incorporated a 
Supplemental Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis (Supplemental 
IRFA) in the Auction 113 Comment 
Public Notice released in March 2025. 
OEA and WTB sought written public 
comment on the proposals in the 
Auction 113 Comment Public Notice, 
including comments on the 
Supplemental IRFA. The comments 
received on the Supplemental IRFA are 
addressed below. The Auction 113 
Procedures Public Notice establishes the 
procedures to be used for Auction 113. 
This Final Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis (FRFA) reflects actions taken 
in the Auction 113 Procedures Public 
Notice, and supplements the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analyses 
completed by the Commission in the 
2014 AWS–3 Report and Order, the 
2025 AWS–3 Report and Order, and 
other Commission orders pursuant to 
which Auction 113 will be conducted. 
This FRFA conforms to the RFA, and it 
(or summaries thereof) will be 
published in the Federal Register. 
Need for, and Objectives of, the Rules. 
The Auction 113 Procedures Public Notice resolves all open issues, and addresses comments filed in response to 
the Auction 113 Comment Public Notice. The licenses in Auction 113 are being offered pursuant to the Spectrum 
and Secure Technology and Innovations 
Act, which directs the Commission to 
initiate a system of competitive bidding 
to grant licenses for spectrum in its 
inventory in the AWS–3 spectrum 
bands. The Auction 113 Procedures 
Public Notice implements auction 
procedures for those entities that seek to 
bid in Auction 113 to acquire 
geographic-based licenses in the 1695– 
1710 MHz, 1755–1780 MHz, and 2155– 
2180 MHz bands (collectively, the 
AWS–3 bands). The Auction 113 
Procedures Public Notice adopts 
procedural rules and terms and 
conditions governing Auction 113, and 
the post-auction application and 
payment processes, as well as sets the 
minimum opening bid amounts for 
licenses in the AWS–3 bands that will 
be offered in Auction 113. 
To promote the efficient and fair 
administration of the competitive 
bidding process for all Auction 113 
participants, including small entities, 
OEA and WTB adopt the following 
procedures for Auction 113: 
€A requirement that any applicant seeking to participate in Auction 113 
certify in its short-form application, 
under penalty of perjury, that it has read 
the public notice adopting procedures 
for Auction 113 and that it has 
familiarized itself with those procedures 
and the requirements for a license and 
operating facilities in the AWS–3 bands; 
€A requirement that any applicant seeking to bid in the 1755–1780 MHz 
submit a signed statement with its short- 
form application acknowledging that the 
applicant’s operations in the 1755–1780 
MHz band may be subject to 
interference from Federal systems in 
certain geographic zones, that the 
applicant must accept interference from 
such Federal systems in those zones, 
and that the applicant has considered 
these risks before submitting any bids 
for applicable licenses in Auction 113; 
€Identification of AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon as nationwide providers for 
the purpose of implementing the 
competitive bidding rules in Auction 
113, including 47 CFR 1.2105(c), the 
rule prohibiting certain 
communications; 
€Use of anonymous bidding/limited information procedures, under which 
OEA and WTB will not make the 
following information public until after 
bidding has closed: (1) the licenses that 
an applicant selects for bidding in its 
short-form application (FCC Form 175); 
(2) the amount of any upfront payment 
made by or on behalf of an applicant for 
Auction 113; (3) any applicant’s bidding 
eligibility; and (4) any other bidding- 
related information that might reveal the 
identity of the bidder placing a bid; 
€Establishment of bidding credit caps for eligible small businesses in 
Auction 113; 
€Establishment of bidding credit caps for eligible rural service providers 
in Auction 113; 
€Use of a clock auction format (clock-1) with a supply of one for 
Auction 113 under which each qualified 
bidder will indicate in successive clock 
bidding rounds its demand for licenses 
at the prices associated with the current 
round; 
€Use of a simultaneous stopping rule for Auction 113, under which all 
licenses remain available for bidding 
until no license has excess demand; 
€Establishment of a specific minimum opening bid for each license 
available in Auction 113 based on $0.01 
per MHz-pop for the paired licenses in 
areas with a population of less than 
300,000, $0.02 per MHz-pop for the 
paired licenses in areas with a 
population of at least 300,000 and less 
than 1,000,000, $0.05 per MHz-pop for 
the paired licenses in areas with a 
population of at least 1,000,000, and 
$0.01 per MHz-pop for the unpaired 
licenses, with a minimum opening bid 
of $1,000 per license; 
€A specific upfront payment amount for each license available in Auction 
113; 
€Establishment of a bidder’s initial bidding eligibility in bidding units 
based on that bidder’s upfront payment 
through assignment of a specific number 
of bidding units for each license; 
€Provision of delegated authority to OEA, in conjunction with WTB, to 
exercise its discretion to delay, suspend, 
or cancel bidding in Auction 113 for any 
reason that affects the ability of the

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60009 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations competitive bidding process to be 
conducted fairly and efficiently; 
€Retention by OEA of discretion to adjust the bidding schedule in order to 
manage the pace of Auction 113; 
€Use of information procedures which would make public after each 
round of Auction 113, for each license, 
the aggregate demand, the posted price 
of the last completed round, and the 
clock price for the next round; 
€Use of an activity rule that would require bidders to be active on between 
90% and 100% of their bidding 
eligibility in all clock rounds, with the 
initial activity requirement percentage 
set at 95%, and with OEA retaining 
discretion to change the activity 
requirement percentage during the 
auction; 
€Establishment of acceptable bid amounts, including clock price 
increments and intra-round bids, along 
with a proposed methodology for 
calculating such amounts; 
€An option to permit a bidder to submit a proxy instruction to reduce its 
demand for a license to zero at a price 
higher than the current round’s clock 
price and a requirement that bidders 
indicate their demand in every round or 
submit appropriate proxy instructions; 
€Establishment of a methodology for processing bids and requests to reduce 
and increase demand subject to the no 
excess supply rule for bids to reduce 
demand and the eligibility rule for bids 
to increase demand; and 
€Establishment of an additional default payment of 20% under 47 CFR 
1.2104(g)(2) of the rules in the event that 
a winning bidder defaults or is 
disqualified after the auction. 
The procedures for the conduct of 
Auction 113 constitute the more specific 
implementation of the competitive 
bidding rules contemplated by 47 CFR 
parts 1 and 27, and the underlying 
rulemaking orders, including the 2014 
AWS–3 Report and Order, the 2025 AWS–3 Report and Order, and relevant 
competitive bidding orders, and are 
fully consistent therewith. 
Response to Comments by the Chief 
Counsel for Advocacy of the Small 
Business Administration. Pursuant to 
the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, 
which amended the RFA, the 
Commission is required to respond to 
any comments filed by the Chief 
Counsel for Advocacy of the Small 
Business Administration (SBA) and 
provide a detailed statement of any 
changes made to the proposed 
procedures as a result of those 
comments. The Chief Counsel did not 
file any comments in response to the 
procedures that were proposed in the 
Auction 113 Comment Public Notice. 
Summary of Significant Issues Raised 
by Public Comments in Response to the 
IRFA. The only party that filed comments directly in response to the 
Supplemental IRFA contends that the 
Commission’s definition of ‘‘small 
entities’’ used in the Supplemental 
IRFA ‘‘may unintentionally exclude 
businesses in high-cost urban markets’’ 
because ‘‘while these businesses fall 
outside the thresholds for ‘small 
entities,’ they often face challenges 
similar to those in rural areas, such as 
high operational costs and limited 
resources.’’ That commenter suggests 
that the Commission ‘‘reevaluate its 
small entity criteria by considering 
factors like regional cost variations and 
market-specific metrics (e.g., population density, median income, broadband 
access) . . . [to] better align with [47 
U.S.C.] 309(j)(3)(B)’s goal of promoting 
diverse participation and equitable 
access to spectrum,’’ and notes that the 
Supplemental IRFA highlights the 
compliance burdens that Auction 113 
could impose and suggests that a more 
detailed analysis of these costs—broken 
down by market type or industry— 
would help uncover the unique 
challenges small businesses in 
underserved markets face. That 
commenter submits that providing tools 
such as reporting templates, compliance 
checklists, and cost estimation guides 
would further support small entities, 
reduce administrative burdens, and 
enable broader participation in Auction 
113. 
Other parties filed comments relating 
to small entities in response to the 
proposals in the Auction 113 Comment 
Public Notice. Two parties advocate that 
licenses for AWS–3 spectrum should be 
offered in smaller licensing areas in 
Auction 113, with one of these parties 
specifically asserting that small 
businesses would benefit from changing 
the geographic area of Block G to 
offering licenses at a county level rather 
than the CMA level. Several parties 
opposed the request to change the 
geographic area size of Block G from 
CMAs to counties. Some commenters 
oppose any amendments to small 
business bidding credits in effect for 
Auction 97 for Auction 113. In these 
comments, there were two prevailing 
themes of discussion: (1) the application 
of the 47 CFR part 1, subpart Q small 
business bidding rules in effect for 
Auction 97, and (2) the proposal for a 
$25 million bidding credit cap for 
Auction 113. Regarding the application 
of 47 CFR part 1, subpart Q small 
business bidding rules, two parties 
specifically advocate for applying the 47 
CFR part 1, subpart Q designated entity 
rules in effect for Auction 97 in Auction 
113 because they contend that any rule 
changes will be to the detriment of 
small businesses, amongst other 
concerns unrelated to small businesses. 
Regarding the proposal to apply a $25 
million small business bidding credit 
cap in Auction 113, all parties 
commenting on the proposal oppose it. 
All of these parties oppose any bidding 
credit cap, however, one of these parties 
advocates for an increase of the bidding 
credit cap to $33 million in order to 
adjust the bidding credit cap to account 
for inflation if bidding credit caps are 
adopted for Auction 113. Additionally, 
one party opposes the proposed 95% 
activity level to retain full eligibility, 
because although it encourages active 
participation, it may unintentionally 
exclude less experienced bidders and 
small entities that lack the resources to 
engage dynamically in every round. 
Description and Estimate of the 
Number of Small Entities to Which the 
Rules Will Apply. The RFA directs 
agencies to provide a description of and, 
where feasible, an estimate of the 
number of small entities that may be 
affected by the proposed rules, if 
adopted. The RFA generally defines the 
term ‘‘small entity’’ as having the same 
meaning as the terms ‘‘small business,’’ 
‘‘Small organization, and ‘‘small 
governmental jurisdiction.’’ In addition, 
the term ‘‘small business’’ has the same 
meaning as the term ‘‘small business 
concern’’ under the Small Business Act 
(SBA). A ‘‘small business concern’’ is 
one which: (1) is independently owned 
and operated; (2) is not dominant in its 
field of operation; and (3) satisfies any 
additional criteria established by the 
SBA. The SBA establishes small 
business size standards that agencies are 
required to use when promulgating 
regulations relating to small businesses; 
agencies may establish alternative size 
standards for use in such programs, but 
must consult and obtain approval from 
SBA before doing so. 
The Commission’s actions, over time, 
may affect small entities that are not 
easily categorized at present. The 
Commission therefore describes three 
broad groups of small entities that could 
be directly affected by its actions. In 
general, a small business is an 
independent business having fewer than 
500 employees. These types of small 
businesses represent 99.9% of all 
businesses in the United States, which 
translates to 34.75 million businesses. 
Next, ‘‘small organizations’’ are not-for- 
profit enterprises that are independently 
owned and operated and not dominant 
in their field. While the Commission 
does not have data regarding the 
number of non-profits that meet that 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60010 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations criteria, over 99 percent of nonprofits 
have fewer than 500 employees. Finally, 
‘‘small governmental jurisdictions’’ are 
defined as cities, counties, towns, 
townships, villages, school districts, or 
special districts with populations of less 
than fifty thousand. Based on the 2022 
U.S. Census of Governments data, the 
Commission estimates that at least 
48,724 out of 90,835 local government 
jurisdictions have a population of less 
than 50,000. 
The procedures adopted in the 
Auction 113 Procedures Public Notice 
will apply to small entities in the 
industries identified in the chart below 
by their six-digit North American 
Industry Classification System (NAICS) 
codes and corresponding SBA size 
standard. The NAICS is the standard 
used by Federal statistical agencies in 
classifying business establishments for 
the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and 
publishing statistical data related to the 
U.S. business economy. See 
www.census.gov/NAICS for further details regarding the NAICS codes. The 
size standards in Table 1 are set forth in 
13 CFR 121.201, by six digit NAICS 
code. Based on currently available U.S. 
Census data regarding the estimated 
number of small firms in each identified 
industry, OEA and WTB conclude that 
the adopted procedures will impact a 
substantial number of small entities. 
Where available, OEA and WTB also 
provide additional information 
regarding the number of potentially 
affected entities in the industries 
identified in Tables 1 and 2.

Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite) ..................................................... 585 498 85.13 Description of Economic Impact and 
Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping and 
Other Compliance Requirements for 
Small Entities. The RFA directs agencies 
to describe the economic impact of 
proposed rules on small entities, as well 
as projected reporting, recordkeeping 
and other compliance requirements, 
including an estimate of the classes of 
small entities which will be subject to 
the requirement and the type of 
professional skills necessary for 
preparation of the report or record. The 
Commission designed the auction 
application process to minimize 
reporting and compliance requirements 
for small entities and other applicants, 
and the Auction 113 Procedures Public 
Notice reflects its efforts to remain consistent with this approach. In the 
first part of the Commission’s two- 
phased auction application process, 
parties desiring to participate in an 
auction file streamlined, short-form 
applications in which they certify under 
penalty of perjury as to their 
qualifications, and to having reviewed 
the Auction 113 Procedures Public Notice. Eligibility to participate in bidding is based on an applicant’s short- 
form application and certifications, as 
well as remittance of a timely and 
sufficient upfront payment. In the 
second phase of the process, winning 
bidders file a more comprehensive long- 
form application. Thus, an applicant 
that fails to become a winning bidder 
does not need to file a long-form 
application or provide the additional 
showings and more detailed 
demonstrations required of a winning 
bidder, thereby saving small entities and 
other applicants the time and expense 
associated with unnecessary filings. 
Applicants that wish to participate in 
Auction 113 are required to certify that 
they have read the Auction 113 
Procedures Public Notice and the 
procedures adopted herein, and are also 
familiar with the procedures and 
requirements for obtaining a license and 
operating facilities in the AWS–3 bands. 
The certification requirement allows 
applicants to educate themselves about 
the procedures for participation in 
Auction 113, as well as their obligation 
to stay abreast of relevant information 
before bidding in Auction 113 begins, 
and throughout the entire Auction 113 
process. Adoption of this requirement 
may help small entities and other 
applicants avoid, among other things, 
rule violations or technical errors that 
could prevent them from becoming a 
qualified bidder or obtaining a license 
after placing a winning bid. Moreover, 
as discussed below, the Commission 
makes available to potential and actual 
participants, at no cost, a variety of 
information, resources, and guidance, 
including interactive, online tutorials 
and technical guides. The requirement 
that applicants certify that they have 
read the Auction 113 Procedures Public 
Notice and are familiar with the procedures and requirements for the 
auction will help ensure that small 
entity applicants are aware that these 
detailed educational materials, which 
are designed to enhance their 
understanding of the pre-bidding and 
bidding processes, are available for their 
use. 
OEA and WTB do not expect that the 
processes and procedures adopted in 
the Auction 113 Procedures Public Notice will require small entities to hire attorneys, engineers, consultants, or 
other professionals to participate in 
Auction 113 and comply with the 
procedures they adopt. Moreover, OEA 
and WTB do not believe that the cost of 
compliance will unduly burden small 
entities that choose to participate in the 
auction. The processes and procedures 
adopted in the Auction 113 Procedures 
Public Notice are consistent with 
existing Commission policies and 
procedures used in prior auctions. Thus, 
some small entities may already be 
familiar with such procedures and have 
the processes and procedures in place to 
facilitate compliance and minimize 
their costs to comply. Even for those 
small entities that may be new to the

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60011 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations Commission’s auction process, the 
various resources that will be made 
available, including, but not limited to, 
the mock auction, remote electronic 
bidding, and access to hotlines for both 
technical and auction assistance, should 
help facilitate participation without the 
need to hire professionals. These 
resources are in addition to the 
resources discussed in the Auction 113 
Procedures Public Notice that small 
entities and other applicants will be 
able to access. By providing these 
resources as well as the resources 
discussed below, OEA and WTB expect 
small entities that use the available 
resources to experience lower 
participation and compliance costs. 
Discussion of Steps Taken to 
Minimize the Significant Economic 
Impact on Small Entities, and 
Significant Alternatives Considered. The 
RFA requires an agency to provide ‘‘a 
description of the steps the agency has 
taken to minimize the significant 
economic impact on small entities . . . 
including a statement of the factual, 
policy, and legal reasons for selecting 
the alternative adopted in the final rule 
and why each one of the other 
significant alternatives to the rule 
considered by the agency which affect 
the impact on small entities was 
rejected.’’ 
In the Auction 113 Procedures Public 
Notice, OEA and WTB have taken steps to minimize any economic impact of the 
Commission’s auction procedures on 
small businesses through, among other 
things, the many resources provided to 
potential auction participants. 
Consistent with the past practices in 
prior auctions, small entities that are 
potential participants will have access 
to detailed educational information and 
Commission personnel to help guide 
their participation in Auction 113, 
which should alleviate any need to hire 
professionals. Only one party filed 
comments in response to the Auction 
113 Comment Public Notice regarding 
the Commission’s provision of these 
materials. In reaching their conclusions 
in the Auction 113 Procedures Public 
Notice, OEA and WTB considered the alternatives presented in this party’s 
comments. For example, this party 
advocates for additional educational 
support in the form of personalized and 
interactive tools claiming that the 
available educational materials are often 
too generalized for bidders, particularly 
small entities, to apply to their 
particular circumstances, also suggests 
that the Commission provide a more 
detailed analysis, including additional 
educational resources, of the costs of 
compliance with the Supplemental 
IRFA to further support small 
businesses in underserved markets. By 
this party’s own acknowledgement, 
however, the Commission’s educational 
resources are ‘‘valuable components’’ to 
a ‘‘demonstra[ble] commitment to 
equipping participants with the tools 
they need for Auction 113.’’ 
To assist small entities with the AAS 
and the bidding system in Auction 113, 
the Commission currently offers a wide 
variety of free educational materials, 
demonstrations, educational 
opportunities, and other information 
and resources. For example, small 
entities and other would-be participants 
will also be provided with various 
materials on the pre-bidding process in 
advance of the short-form application 
filing window, which includes step-by- 
step instructions on how to complete 
FCC Form 175. The Commission has 
taken steps to ensure that the AAS is 
simple to use, and that FCC Form 175 
is easy to complete. For example, if an 
applicant for Auction 113 previously 
filed an FCC Form 602 ownership 
disclosure information report or filed an 
application to participate in a previous 
auction in which ownership 
information was disclosed and the 
applicant uses the same FRN used to 
make that filing to create its FCC Form 
175 for Auction 113, the AAS will give 
the applicant the option to pre-fill the 
most current ownership information 
contained in any such filing into certain 
ownership sections on the applicant’s 
FCC Form 175. Accordingly, in light of 
all the educational resources the 
Commission already provides to bidders 
in an auction, OEA and WTB conclude 
that the added benefit, if any, of 
developing alternative personalized and 
interactive educational tools in time for 
Auction 113 is outweighed by the time 
and expense that the Commission 
would incur to customize such 
resources. 
In addition, small entities will have 
access to the web-based, interactive 
online tutorials produced by 
Commission staff to familiarize 
themselves with auction procedures, 
filing requirements, bidding procedures, 
and other matters related to an auction. 
Prior to the start of bidding, eligible 
bidders will be given an opportunity to 
become familiar with auction 
procedures and the bidding system by 
participating in a mock auction. Eligible 
bidders will have access to a user guide 
for the bidding system, bidding file 
formats, and an online bidding 
procedures tutorial in advance of the 
mock auction. Further, OEA and WTB 
will conduct Auction 113 electronically 
over the internet using a web-based 
bidding system that eliminates the need 
for small entities and other bidders to be 
physically present in a specific location. 
These mechanisms are made available 
to facilitate participation in Auction 113 
by all eligible bidders and may result in 
significant cost savings for small entities 
that use them. Moreover, the adoption 
of bidding procedures in advance of the 
auction, consistent with statutory 
directive, is designed to ensure that the 
auction will be administered 
predictably and fairly for all 
participants, including small 
businesses. These steps provide 
measures to prepare and support the 
ability of a small business to 
comprehend the Commission’s bidding 
rules, including the rules relating to the 
proposal for a 95% activity level to 
retain full eligibility in auction rounds. 
Given the steps they have taken, OEA 
and WTB decline to adopt the 
alternative proposal offered by a 
commenter to lower the activity rule 
threshold. 
Small entities and other auction 
participants may seek clarification of, or 
guidance on, complying with 
competitive bidding rules and 
procedures, reporting requirements, and 
using the bidding system at any stage of 
the auction process. Additionally, the 
FCC Auctions Hotline will provide 
small entities one-on-one access to 
Commission staff for information about 
the auction process and procedures. 
Further, the FCC Auctions Technical 
Support Hotline is another resource that 
provides technical assistance to 
applicants, including small entities, on 
issues such as access to or navigation 
within the electronic FCC Form 175 and 
use of the bidding system. 
The Commission also makes various 
databases and other sources of 
information, including the Auctions 
program websites and copies of 
Commission decisions, available to the 
public without charge, providing a low- 
cost mechanism for small entities to 
conduct research prior to and 
throughout the auction. Prior to the start 
of bidding, and at the close of Auction 
113, OEA and WTB will post public 
notices on the Commission’s Auctions 
website that articulate the procedures 
and deadlines for the auction. The 
Commission makes this information 
easily accessible and without charge to 
benefit small entities and other Auction 
113 applicants, including small entities, 
thereby lowering their administrative 
costs to comply with the Commission’s 
competitive bidding rules. 
After the initial application stage, 
auction participants whose applications 
have been deemed incomplete have the 
opportunity to correct certain errors. An 
applicant whose application is deemed 
incomplete will receive a letter from the 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:20 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\23DER1.SGM 23DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60012 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Rules and Regulations Commission identifying the specific 
errors in their application and providing 
the contact information for a specific 
Commission staff member who has been 
assigned to provide assistance. 
Additionally, after the application 
process is complete and the 
Commission has identified the 
applicants who will be qualified to bid 
in Auction 113, all qualified bidders for 
Auction 113 will automatically be 
registered for the auction, and 
registration materials will be distributed 
prior to the auction by overnight 
delivery. Applicants are not required to 
take any further steps until bidding 
commences. 
Another step taken to minimize the 
economic impact for small entities 
participating in Auction 113 is the 
Commission’s adoption of bidding 
credits for small businesses and rural 
service providers. OEA and WTB 
received comments discussing the 
adoption of bidding credits for small 
businesses and rural service providers 
and the application of the 47 CFR part 
1, subpart Q bidding credit rules as in 
effect for Auction 97 in Auction 113. 
These discussions of eligibility for small 
business bidding credits were resolved 
in the 2025 AWS–3 Report and Order. 
In accordance with the service rules 
applicable to the AWS–3 band licenses 
to be offered in Auction 113, bidding 
credit discounts will be available to 
eligible small businesses and small 
business consortia on the following 
basis: (1) a bidder with attributed 
average annual gross revenues that do 
not exceed $55 million for the preceding 
five years is eligible to receive a 15% 
discount on its overall payment; or (2) 
a bidder with attributed average annual 
gross revenues that do not exceed $20 
million for the preceding five years is 
eligible to receive a 25% discount on its 
overall payment. Eligible applicants can 
receive only one of the available small 
business bidding credits—not both. 
An eligible rural service provider may 
request a 15% discount on its overall 
payment using a rural service provider 
bidding credit. To be eligible for a rural 
service provider bidding credit, an 
applicant must: (1) be a service provider 
that is in the business of providing 
commercial communications services 
and, together with its controlling 
interests, affiliates, and the affiliates of 
its controlling interests, has fewer than 
250,000 combined wireless, wireline, 
broadband, and cable subscribers; and 
(2) serve predominantly rural areas. 
Rural areas are defined as counties with 
a population density of 100 or fewer 
persons per square mile. Eligible 
applicants can request either a small 
business bidding credit or a rural 
service provider bidding credit, but not 
both. 
The total bidding credit discount that 
may be awarded to an eligible small 
business is capped at $25 million and 
there is a $10 million cap that may be 
awarded to a rural service provider. In 
addition, to create parity among eligible 
small businesses and rural service 
providers competing against each other 
in smaller markets, OEA and WTB 
adopt a $10 million cap on the overall 
amount of bidding credits that any 
winning designated entity bidder may 
apply to winning licenses in markets 
with a population of 500,000 or less. 
Based on the technical characteristics of 
AWS–3 licenses and their analysis of 
past auction data, OEA and WTB 
anticipate that the caps adopted in the 
Auction 113 Procedures Public Notice 
will allow the majority of small 
businesses to take full advantage of the 
bidding credit program, thereby 
lowering the relative costs of 
participation for small businesses. 
While eligible entities will have the 
opportunity to compete at auction 
without being unduly constrained, the 
caps are reasonable enough to ensure 
that ineligible entities are not 
encouraged to undercut the 
Commission’s rules, thereby achieving 
the Commission’s dual statutory goals of 
benefiting designated entities and at the 
same time preventing unjust 
enrichment. In Auction 113, bidding 
credit caps were adopted not only 
because OEA and WTB are required to 
do so by 47 CFR part 1, subpart Q, but 
also because bidding credit caps provide 
safeguards for both the Commission and 
small entities and other Auction 113 
bidders. Therefore, OEA and WTB 
rejected the alternatives received in 
comments opposing the bidding credit 
cap as proposed, including those 
opposing any form of a bidding credit 
cap as well as those opposing proposals 
for an increase. Likewise, OEA and 
WTB are unable to consider any changes 
to the geographic size of licenses offered 
in Auction 113, as proposed by a 
commenter and supported by another 
commenter, because the Commission 
adopted the use of CMAs for AWS–3 
spectrum licenses in the context of a 
rulemaking and amending that decision 
is outside the scope of OEA’s and 
WTB’s delegated authority to establish 
auction procedures. 
A Tribal lands bidding credit will also 
be available to winning bidders that 
intend to deploy facilities and provide 
services to qualifying Tribal lands that 
have a wireline penetration rate equal or 
below 85%. The Tribal lands bidding 
credit is in addition to, and separate 
from, any other bidding credit winning 
bidders may qualify to claim. Therefore, 
small entities that are eligible for the 
small or rural bidding credit can also 
claim the Tribal lands bidding credit, 
provided they meet the requirements of 
47 CFR 1.2107 and 1.2110(f). 
The procedures for the conduct of 
Auction 113 constitute the more specific 
implementation of the competitive 
bidding rules contemplated by 47 CFR 
parts 1 and 27 and the underlying 
rulemaking orders, including the 2014 
AWS–3 Report and Order, the 2025 AWS–3 Report and Order, and relevant 
competitive bidding orders, and are 
fully consistent therewith.

Angling Component Closure in Federal 
Waters Off Texas 
AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 
Commerce. 
ACTION: Temporary rule; closure. SUMMARY: NMFS announces a closure for the 2026 fishing season for the red 
snapper recreational private angling 
component in the exclusive economic 
zone (EEZ) off Texas in the Gulf of 
America (Gulf) through this temporary 
rule. The red snapper recreational 
private angling component in the Gulf 
EEZ off Texas will close at 12:01 a.m., 
local time, on January 1, 2026, until 
12:01 a.m., local time, on May 22, 2026. 
This closure is necessary to prevent the 
private angling component from 
exceeding the Texas regional 
management area annual catch limit 
(ACL) and to prevent overfishing of the 
Gulf red snapper resource. 
DATES: This closure is effective at 12:01 a.m., local time, on January 1, 2026, 
until 12:01 a.m., local time, on May 22, 
2026.

Frank Helies, NMFS Southeast Regional 
Office, telephone: 727–824–5305, email: 
Frank.Helies@noaa.gov. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Gulf reef fish fishery, which includes red 
snapper, is managed under the Fishery 
Management Plan for the Reef Fish 
Resources of the Gulf (FMP). The FMP 
was prepared by the Gulf Fishery 
Management Council, approved by the 
Secretary of Commerce, and is 
implemented by NMFS under the 
authority of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) by 
regulations at 50 CFR part 622. 
The final rule implementing 
Amendment 40 to the FMP established 
two components within the recreational 
sector fishing for Gulf red snapper: the 
private angling component, and the 
Federal for-hire component (80 FR 
22422, April 22, 2015). Amendment 40 
also allocated the red snapper 
recreational ACL (recreational quota) 
between the components and 
established separate seasonal closures 
for the two components. On February 6, 
2020, NMFS implemented Amendments 
50 A–F to the FMP, which delegated 
authority to the Gulf states (Louisiana, 
Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, and 
Texas) to establish specific management 
measures for the harvest of red snapper 
in Federal waters of the Gulf by the 
private angling component of the 
recreational sector (85 FR 6819, 
February 6, 2020). These amendments 
allocated a portion of the private angling 
ACL to each state, and each state is 
required to constrain landings to its 
allocation. 
As described at 50 CFR 622.23(c), a 
Gulf state with an active delegation may 
request that NMFS close all, or an area 
of, Federal waters off that state to the 
harvest and possession of red snapper 
by private anglers. The state is required 
to request the closure by letter to NMFS, 
providing dates and geographic 
coordinates for the closure. If the 
request is within the scope of the 
analysis in Amendment 50A, NMFS 
publishes a notice in the Federal 
Register implementing the closure for the fishing year. Based on the analysis 
in Amendment 50A, Texas may request 
a closure of all Federal waters off the 
state to allow a year-round fishing 
season in state waters. As described at 
50 CFR 622.2, ‘‘off Texas’’ is defined as 
the waters in the Gulf west of a rhumb 
line from 29°32.1 N lat., 93°47.7 W long. to 26°11.4 N lat., 92°53 W long., which line is an extension of the 
boundary between Louisiana and Texas. 
On December 9, 2025, NMFS received 
a request from the Texas Parks and 
Wildlife Department (TPWD) to close 
the EEZ off Texas to the red snapper 
recreational private angling component 
during the 2026 fishing year. Texas 
requested that the closure be effective 
from January 1 through May 21, 2026. 
NMFS has determined that this request 
is within the scope of the analysis 
contained within Amendment 50A, 
which analyzed the potential impacts of 
a closure of all Federal waters off Texas, 
consistent with Texas’s intent to 
maintain a year-round fishing season in 
state waters during which a part of 
Texas’ ACL could be caught. 
Therefore, the red snapper 
recreational private angling component 
in the Gulf EEZ off Texas will close at 
12:01 a.m., local time, on January 1, 
2026, until 12:01 a.m., local time, on 
May 22, 2026. This closure applies to all 
private-anglers (those on board vessels 
that have not been issued a valid 
Federal charter vessel/headboat permit 
for Gulf reef fish) regardless of which 
state they are from or where they intend 
to land. Once the EEZ off Texas opens 
on May 22, 2026, TPWD will continue 
to monitor private recreational landings, 
and if necessary, will request that NMFS 
again close the EEZ in 2026 to ensure 
the Texas regional management area 
ACL is not exceeded. 
On and after the effective date of this 
closure in the EEZ off Texas, the harvest 
and possession of red snapper in the 
EEZ off Texas by the private angling 
component is prohibited and the bag 
and possession limits for the red 
snapper private angling component in 
the closed area is zero. 
Classification 
NMFS issues this action pursuant to 
section 305(d) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act. This action is required by 50 CFR 
622.23(c), which was issued pursuant to 
304(b), and is exempt from review 
under Executive Order 12866, and other 
applicable laws. 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), there 
is good cause to waive prior notice and 
an opportunity for public comment on 
this action, as notice and comment are 
unnecessary and contrary to the public 
interest. Such procedures are 
unnecessary because the rule 
implementing the area closure authority 
and the state-specific private angling 
ACLs has already been subject to notice 
and comment, and all that remains is to 
notify the public of the closure. Such 
procedures are contrary to the public 
interest because a failure to implement 
the closure by January 1, 2026, would be 
inconsistent with Texas’s state 
management plan and may result in less 
access to red snapper in state waters. 
For the aforementioned reasons, there 
is also good cause to waive the 30-day 
delay in the effectiveness of this action 
under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of 
America; Partial Holdback of 
Commercial Quota for the Deep-Water 
Grouper Complex 
AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 
Commerce. 
ACTION: Temporary rule; commercial quota holdback. 
SUMMARY: NMFS issues this temporary rule to withhold a portion of the 
commercial allocation of deep-water 
grouper (DWG) for the 2026 fishing year 
in anticipation of the upcoming 
rulemaking for Amendment 58B to the 
Fishery Management Plan for the Reef 
Fish Resources of the Gulf (FMP). If 
approved and implemented, 
Amendment 58B would, in part, end 
overfishing of yellowedge grouper and 
reduce the DWG commercial annual 
catch limit (ACL) and commercial 
quota. This temporary rule will 
withhold a portion of the distribution of 
DWG individual fishing quota (IFQ) 
allocation on January 1, 2026, to 
shareholders in the Groupers and 
Tilefishes IFQ (GT–IFQ) program in the 
amount equal to the anticipated 
reduction in the commercial quota. 
DATES: This temporary rule is effective from January 1, 2026, until June 1, 2026. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dan Luers, NMFS Southeast Regional Office, 
telephone: 727–824–5305, email: 
daniel.luers@noaa.gov. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The reef fish fishery in the Gulf of America (Gulf) 
includes DWG and is managed under 
the FMP. The FMP was prepared by the 
Gulf Fishery Management Council 
(Council), approved by the Secretary of 
Commerce, and is implemented by 
NMFS through regulations at 50 CFR 
part 622 under the authority of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act 
(Magnuson-Stevens Act). 
All catch limits in this temporary rule 
are in pounds (lb) gutted weight. 
In the Gulf, the DWG complex 
consists of yellowedge grouper, warsaw 
grouper, snowy grouper, and speckled 
hind. Commercial harvest of the DWG 
species occurs under the GT–IFQ 
program and landings are managed to 
the commercial quota, which is reduced 
from the commercial ACL. The current 
DWG commercial ACL is 1,070,000 lb 
(485,000 kg) and the commercial quota 
is 1,024,000 lb (464,000 kg), which is 4 
percent below the commercial ACL. The 
buffer between the commercial ACL and 
the commercial quota is in place to 
account for scientific uncertainty with 
the level of discards and to allow for the 
IFQ flexibility measures under which 
some species in the shallow-water 
grouper complex can be landed under 
the DWG quota. 
In 2023, the Southeast Data, 
Assessment, and Review 85 (SEDAR 85) 
assessed Gulf yellowedge grouper and 
indicated that while the stock was not 
overfished, it was experiencing 
overfishing and therefore harvest must 
be reduced. The Council’s Scientific and 
Statistical Committee (SSC) accepted 
SEDAR 85 as consistent with the best 
scientific information available and 
recommended updated status 
determination criteria and catch levels 
for yellowedge grouper. The Council’s 
SSC then evaluated the catch limits for 
the remaining species in the DWG 
complex and recommended that their 
catch levels also be reduced. As a result 
of the SSC recommendations, the 
Council initiated work on Amendment 
58B to, among other measures, end 
overfishing of yellowedge grouper and 
reduce the harvest of the other species 
in the DWG complex. The Council 
approved Amendment 58B at its August 
2025 meeting and is preparing to submit 
the amendment to NMFS for review. If 
approved, NMFS expects any final rule 
implementing Amendment 58B to be 
effective no later than June 1, 2026. 
Consistent with the SSC’s 
recommendations, Amendment 58B 
would reduce the total allowable 
harvest of DWG. For the commercial 
sector, Amendment 58B would reduce 
the commercial ACL from 1,070,000 lb 
(485,000 kg) to 498,358 lb (226,051 kg) 
and the commercial quota from 
1,024,000 lb (464,000 kg) to 478,424 lb 
(217,009 kg). 
Under the GT–IFQ program, annual 
quota is distributed to IFQ shareholders 
as allocation (including multi-use 
allocation) on January 1, and most IFQ 
program participants begin to use or 
transfer their allocation early in each 
year. After shareholders begin 
transferring or landing allocation, NMFS 
is not able to retroactively withdraw 
allocation from shareholder accounts if 
a commercial quota decrease becomes 
effective after the beginning of the 
fishing year. Regulations at 50 CFR 
622.22(a)(4), require NMFS to withhold 
distribution of IFQ allocation on January 
1 in the amount equal to an expected 
reduction in the commercial quota. 
Accordingly, through this temporary 
rule NMFS withholds distribution of a 
portion of the 2026 commercial quota of 
DWG equal to the anticipated reduction 
recommended by the Council in 
Amendment 58B. 
NMFS will distribute the available 
DWG allocation of 478,424 lb (217,009 
kg), on January 1, 2026. If NMFS does 
not implement Amendment 58B, 
including the revised commercial quota, 
by June 1, 2026, then NMFS will 
distribute the withheld allocation back 
to the current shareholders, as 
determined by the shares held on the 
same date that NMFS distributes the 
withheld IFQ quota. 
Classification 
NMFS issues this action pursuant to 
section 305(d) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act. This action is taken under 50 CFR 
622.22(a)(4), which was issued pursuant 
to section 304(b) of the Magnuson- 
Stevens Act, and is exempt from review 
under Executive Order 12866, and other 
applicable laws. 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), there 
is good cause to waive prior notice and 
an opportunity for public comment on 
this action, as notice and comment is 
unnecessary and contrary to the public 
interest. Such procedures are 
unnecessary because the regulation at 
50 CFR 622.22(a)(4) has already been 
subject to notice and public comment, 
and the public is aware of the expected 
quota reduction included in 
Amendment 58B. Therefore, all that 
remains is to notify the public that a 
portion of the commercial DWG 
allocation in 2026 will be withheld to 
allow for the implementation of the 
Amendment 58B in 2026, if approved. 
Such procedures are contrary to the 
public interest because notice and 
comment would require delaying the 
reduction in DWG harvest as specified 
in Amendment 58B until 2027. If NMFS 
does not withhold the necessary DWG 
allocation, shareholders can begin 
transferring or landing allocation on 
January 1, 2026, and NMFS would not 
be able to retroactively withdraw 
allocation from shareholder accounts. 
Delaying implementation of 
Amendment 58B until 2027 could allow 
for continued overfishing of yellowedge 
grouper and harvest of other DWG 
species in excess of the level supported 
by the best scientific information 
available and recommended by the 
Council’s SSC. 
For the aforementioned reasons, the 
NMFS Assistant Administrator also 
finds good cause to waive the 30-day 
delay in the effectiveness of this action 
under 5 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.

Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of 
America; Partial Holdback of 
Commercial Quota for the Other 
Shallow-Water Grouper Complex 
AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 
Commerce. 
ACTION: Temporary rule; commercial quota holdback. 
SUMMARY: NMFS issues this temporary rule to withhold a portion of the 
commercial allocation of the Other 
Shallow-Water Grouper (SWG) complex 
for the 2026 fishing year in anticipation 
of the upcoming rulemaking to 
implement a framework action under 
the Fishery Management Plan for the 
Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf (FMP). 
If implemented by NMFS, the 
framework action would, in part, reduce 
the commercial annual catch limit 
(ACL) and commercial quota for the 
Other SWG complex. This temporary 
rule will withhold the distribution of a 
portion of the Other SWG individual 
fishing quota (IFQ) allocation on 
January 1, 2026, to shareholders in the 
Groupers and Tilefishes IFQ (GT–IFQ) 
program in the amount equal to the 
anticipated reduction in the commercial 
quota. 
DATES: This temporary rule is effective from January 1, 2026, until June 1, 2026. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Frank Helies, NMFS Southeast Regional 
Office, telephone: 727–824–5305, email: 
frank.helies@noaa.gov. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The reef fish fishery in the Gulf of America (Gulf) 
includes Other SWG and is managed 
under the FMP. The FMP was prepared 
by the Gulf Fishery Management 
Council (Council), approved by the 
Secretary of Commerce, and is 
implemented by NMFS through 
regulations at 50 CFR part 622 under the 
authority of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). 
All catch limits in this temporary rule 
are in pounds (lb) gutted weight. 
In the Gulf, the Other SWG complex 
consists of scamp, yellowmouth 
grouper, black grouper, and yellowfin 
grouper. Commercial harvest of Other 
SWG species occurs under the GT–IFQ 
program and landings are managed to 
the commercial quota, which is reduced 
from the commercial ACL. The current 
commercial ACL is 547,000 lb (248,115 
kg) and the commercial annual catch 
target (ACT, or quota) is 526,000 lb 
(238,590 kg), which is 4 percent below 
the commercial ACL. The buffer 
between the commercial ACL and the 
commercial quota is in place to account 
for scientific uncertainty with the level 
of discards and to allow for the IFQ 
flexibility measures under which some 
species in the deep-water grouper 
complex can be landed under the Other 
SWG quota. 
In 2022, the Southeast Data, 
Assessment, and Review 68 (SEDAR 68) 
assessed scamp and yellowmouth 
grouper together and indicated that 
harvest must be reduced. The Council’s 
Scientific and Statistical Committee 
(SSC) accepted SEDAR 68 as consistent 
with the best scientific information 
available and recommended updated 
status determination criteria and catch 
levels for these two stocks. The 
remaining Other SWG species, black 
grouper and yellowfin grouper, could 
not be assessed due to a lack of the data 
necessary to accurately assess 
population metrics of these species in 
the Gulf. 
As a result of the SSC 
recommendations for scamp and 
yellowmouth grouper, the Council 
initiated work on Amendment 58A to 
the FMP, which considers dissolving 
the Other SWG complex and creating 
two new complexes, one for scamp and 
yellowmouth grouper and another for 
black grouper and yellowfin grouper, 
and setting catch limits for these new 
complexes. Amendment 58A also 
considers changes to the commercial 
IFQ program to reflect the two new 
complexes as well as other management 
measures. In recognition of the 
complexity of Amendment 58A and the 
additional time required for its 
development and implementation, the 
Council developed a framework action 
to reduce harvest of scamp and 
yellowmouth, consistent with the SSC 
recommendations, until Amendment 
58A can be completed. The Council 
approved the framework action at its 
June 2025 meeting. If NMFS determines 
that the proposed regulations to 
implement the framework action are 
consistent with the FMP and other 
applicable law, NMFS expects to 
publish a proposed rule in early 2026 
and intends for any final rule to be 
effective by June 1, 2026. The 
framework action would reduce the 
total allowable harvest of Other SWG 
and reduce the commercial ACL from 
547,000 lb (248,115 kg) to 255,636 lb 
(115,955 kg), and the commercial quota 
from 525,000 lb (238,136 kg) to 245,410 
lb (111,316 kg). Commercial landings 
have never exceeded this proposed 
commercial quota. 
Under the GT–IFQ program, annual 
quota is distributed to IFQ shareholders 
as allocation (including multi-use 
allocation) on January 1, and most IFQ 
program participants begin to use or 
transfer their allocation early in each 
year. After shareholders begin 
transferring or landing allocation, NMFS 
is not able to retroactively withdraw 
allocation from shareholder accounts if 
a commercial quota decrease becomes 
effective after the beginning of the 
fishing year. Regulations at 50 CFR 
622.22(a)(4), require NMFS to withhold 
distribution of IFQ allocation on January 
1 in the amount equal to an expected 
reduction in the commercial quota. 
Accordingly, through this temporary 
rule NMFS withholds distribution of the 
portion of the 2026 commercial quota of 
Other SWG equal to the anticipated 
reduction recommended by the Council 
in the framework action. 
NMFS will distribute the available 
Other SWG allocation of 245,410 lb 
(111,316 kg), on January 1, 2026. If 
NMFS does not implement the 
framework action, including the revised 
commercial quota, by June 1, 2026, then 
NMFS will distribute the withheld 
allocation back to the current 
shareholders, as determined by the 
shares held on the same date that NMFS 
distributes the withheld IFQ quota.

is effective before June 1. Such 
procedures are contrary to the public

Atlantic Highly Migratory Species; 
Adjustments to the 2025 North Atlantic 
Albacore Tuna, North and South 
Atlantic Swordfish, and Atlantic 
Bluefin Tuna Category Quotas 
AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 
Commerce. 
ACTION: Temporary rule; quota adjustment. 
SUMMARY: NMFS adjusts the 2025 baseline quotas for U.S. North Atlantic 
albacore tuna (northern albacore) and 
North and South Atlantic swordfish 
quotas based on 2024 underharvest and 
applicable international quota transfers. 
NMFS also adjusts the 2025 Atlantic 
bluefin tuna category subquotas based 
on 2024 overharvest. These temporary 
adjustments apply throughout the 2025 
fishing year and are effective through 
December 31, 2025 (for portions of the 
2025 fishing year that are already 
completed, they are considered to apply 
retrospectively). These actions are 
necessary to implement the 2025 quotas 
consistent with the recommendations of 
the International Commission for the 
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) 
as required by the Atlantic Tunas 
Convention Act (ATCA), and to achieve 
domestic management objectives under 
the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act 
(Magnuson-Stevens Act). Full annual 
baseline allocations will be available to 
U.S. harvesters starting January 1, 2026. 
Note that NMFS intends to take separate 
action as soon as possible in 2026 to 
modify the baseline Atlantic bluefin 
tuna quota consistent with the quota 
agreed to at the 2025 ICCAT annual 
meeting. 
DATES: Effective December 23, 2025, through December 31, 2025.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: U.S. northern albacore, swordfish, and 
bluefin tuna fisheries, are managed 
under the authority of ATCA (16 U.S.C. 
971 et seq.) and the Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.). The Highly 
Migratory Species Fishery Management 
Plan (HMS FMP) and its amendments 
are implemented by regulations at 50 
CFR part 635. Section 635.27(a) 
implements the ICCAT-recommended 
quota and describes the annual quota 
adjustment process for bluefin tuna, 
including in the event of an overharvest. 
Section 635.27(c) implements the 
ICCAT-recommended quotas and 
describes the quota adjustment process 
for both North and South Atlantic 
swordfish. Section 635.27(e) 
implements the northern albacore 
annual quota recommended by ICCAT 
and describes the annual northern 
albacore quota adjustment process. 
NMFS is required under the Magnuson- 
Stevens Act to provide U.S. fishing 
vessels with a reasonable opportunity to 
harvest quotas under relevant 
international fishery agreements such as 
the International Convention for the 
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, which 
is implemented domestically pursuant 
to ATCA. 
Consistent with the relevant binding 
ICCAT Recommendations and the 
requirements under the Magnuson- 
Stevens Act, this action adjusts the 2025 
baseline quotas for U.S. North Atlantic 
albacore tuna (northern albacore) and 
North and South Atlantic swordfish 
quotas based on 2024 underharvest and 
applicable international quota transfer. 
This action also adjusts the 2025 
Atlantic bluefin tuna category subquotas 
based on 2024 overharvest. These 
temporary adjustments apply 
throughout the 2025 fishing year and are 
effective through December 31, 2025 (for 
portions of the 2025 fishing year that are 
already completed, they are considered 
to apply retrospectively). Furthermore, 
these temporary adjustments are 
consistent with the quota levels that 
NMFS considered throughout 2025 
when taking actions during the fishing 
year to adjust the bluefin tuna retention 
limits and close bluefin tuna quota 
categories (e.g., 90 FR 25158, June 16, 2025; 90 FR 45152, September 19, 
2025). Full annual baseline allocations 
will be available to U.S. harvesters 
starting January 1, 2026. Once complete 
catch information for fishing year 2025 
is available, NMFS will determine 
whether any resulting adjustments to 
2026 quotas are necessitated based on 
ICCAT overharvest requirements or 
underharvest carryover allowances. 
Additionally, NMFS plans to take action 
as soon as possible in 2026 to modify 
the baseline bluefin tuna quota 
consistent with the quota that was 
agreed to at the 2025 ICCAT annual 
meeting. 
Note that, consistent with how the 
quotas are established, weight 
information for northern albacore and 
bluefin tuna below is shown in metric 
tons (mt) whole weight (ww), and 
weight information for swordfish is 
shown in both dressed weight (dw) and 
ww. 
Northern Albacore Annual Quota and 
Adjustment Process 
Consistent with the northern albacore 
quota regulations at § 635.27(e), NMFS 
adjusts the U.S. annual northern 
albacore quota for allowable

may be carried forward from one year to 
the next is 25 percent of its baseline 
quota, thus 222.4 mt. 
For 2024, the adjusted quota was 
1,067.3 mt (89 FR 77029, September 20, 
2024). In 2024, the United States landed

North and South Atlantic Swordfish 
Annual Quota and Adjustment Process 
North Atlantic Swordfish 
Consistent with the North Atlantic 
swordfish quota regulations at 
§ 635.27(c), in this action, NMFS adjusts 
the 2025 U.S. annual North Atlantic 
swordfish quota for allowable 
underharvest from 2024. NMFS makes 
such adjustments consistent with 
ICCAT carryover limits and when 
complete catch information for the prior 
year is available and finalized. The U.S. 
North Atlantic swordfish baseline 
annual quota is 2,937.6 mt dw (3,907 mt 
ww). 
As codified at § 635.27(c)(3), the 
maximum North Atlantic swordfish 
underharvest that may be carried 
forward from one year to the next is 15 
percent of the baseline quota, which 
equates to 440.6 mt dw (586 mt ww). 
For 2024, the adjusted North Atlantic 
swordfish quota was 3,227.8 mt dw (89 
FR 77029, September 20, 2024). In 2024, 
U.S. landings of North Atlantic 
swordfish, which includes landings and 
dead discards, was 669.5 mt dw, which 
is 2,558.3 mt dw less than the 2024 
adjusted quota. This underharvest 
exceeds the 440.6-mt dw underharvest 
carryover limit allowed; therefore, only 
440.6 mt dw may be carried forward to 
the 2025 fishing year. Additionally, 
specific to only 2025, ICCAT 
Recommendation 24–10 provides for a 
transfer of quota from the United States 
to Costa Rica of 225.6 mt dw (300 mt 
ww). 
Thus, the adjusted 2025 North 
Atlantic swordfish quota will be 3,152.6 
mt dw (2,937.6-mt dw baseline quota + 
440.6-mt dw underharvest¥225.6-mt 
dw quota transfer to Costa Rica = 
3,152.6 mt dw). From the adjusted quota 
and consistent with § 635.27(c)(1)(i), 50 
mt dw would be allocated to the Reserve 
category for inseason adjustments and 
research; 300 mt dw would be allocated 
to the incidental category, which covers 
recreational landings and landings by 
incidental swordfish permit holders; 
and the remainder of the adjusted quota 
(2,802.6 mt dw) would be allocated to 
the directed category, which will be 
split equally between two seasons in 
2025 (January through June, and July 
through December) (table 2).

† Allowable underharvest carryover is capped at 15 percent of the baseline quota (440.6 mt dw). 
South Atlantic Swordfish 
Consistent with the South Atlantic 
swordfish quota regulations at 
§ 635.27(c), NMFS adjusts the U.S. 
annual South Atlantic swordfish quota 
for allowable underharvest, if any, in 
the previous year. NMFS makes such 
adjustments, if needed, consistent with 
ICCAT carryover limits and when 
complete catch information for the prior 
year is available and finalized. 
Consistent with ICCAT 
Recommendation 17–03 as amended by 
Recommendation 22–04, the U.S. South 
Atlantic swordfish baseline annual 
quota is 75.2 mt dw (100 mt ww), and 
the amount of underharvest that the 
United States can carry forward from 
one year to the next is 75.2 mt dw (100 
mt ww) (table 3). In 2024, there were no 
landings of South Atlantic swordfish by 
U.S. fishermen, which is an 
underharvest of 75.2 mt dw of the 2024 
adjusted quota. Of that underharvest, 
75.2 mt dw may be carried forward to 
the 2025 fishing year. Under 
Recommendations 17–03 and 22–04, the 
United States continues to transfer a 
total of 75.2 mt dw (100 mt ww) to other 
countries. These transfers are 37.6 mt 
dw (50 mt ww) to Namibia, 18.8 mt dw 
(25 mt ww) to Coˆte d’Ivoire, and 18.8 mt 
dw (25 mt ww) to Belize. Thus, the 
adjusted 2025 South Atlantic swordfish 
quota will be 75.2 mt dw (table 3).

Bluefin Tuna Annual Quota, Subquotas, 
and Adjustment Process 
Consistent with the bluefin tuna quota 
regulations at § 635.27(a), in this action, 
NMFS adjusts the 2025 U.S. annual 
bluefin tuna quota and subquotas due to 
an overharvest in 2024. NMFS makes 
such temporary adjustments consistent 
with ICCAT overharvest requirements 
and when complete catch information 
for the prior year is available and 
finalized. The 2025 U.S. bluefin tuna 
baseline annual quota is 1,316.14 mt, 
not including an additional annual 25- 
mt allocation allocated for incidental 
catch by pelagic longline vessels fishing 
in the Northeast Distant gear restricted 
area (NED). As described above, these 
temporary adjustments apply 
throughout the 2025 fishing year and are 
effective through December 31, 2025 (for 
portions of the 2025 fishing year that are 
already completed, they are considered 
to apply retrospectively). Furthermore, 
these temporary adjustments are 
consistent with the quota levels that 
NMFS considered throughout 2025 
when taking actions during the fishing 
year to adjust bluefin tuna retention 
limits and close bluefin tuna quota 
categories (e.g., 90 FR 25158, June 16, 2025; 90 FR 45152, September 19, 
2025). 
Per the regulatory formula established 
at 50 CFR 635.27(a), the baseline bluefin 
tuna quota is divided among domestic 
quota categories according to the 
following percentages: General—54 
percent (710.7 mt); Angling—22.6 
percent (297.4 mt); Longline—15.9 
percent (209.3 mt) (i.e., total not including the 25-mt allocation for the 
NED); Harpoon—4.5 percent (59.2 mt); 
Trap—0.1 percent (1.3 mt); and 
Reserve—2.9 percent (38.2 mt). Note 
that any fishing under exempted fishing 
permits, scientific research permits, and 
display permits per the regulations at 
§ 635.32 is accounted against the school 
reserve or Reserve quota (§ 635.27(a)(6)) 
depending on the size of the fish. 
Under ICCAT Recommendation 22– 
10, if, in a given year, any ICCAT Party 
has an overharvest of its total quota, its 
initial quota for the next year will be 
reduced by 100 percent of the excess of 
such total quota, and ICCAT may 
authorize other appropriate actions. 
Further, if an ICCAT Party has an 
overharvest of its total quota during any 
two consecutive years, ICCAT will 
recommend appropriate measures, 
which may include, but are not limited 
to, reduction in the ICCAT Party’s total 
quota equal to a minimum of 125 
percent of the overharvest amount and, 
if necessary, trade restrictive measures. 
Additionally, under the regulations at 
§ 635.27(a)(9), on an annual basis, based 
on landing, catch statistics, and other 
available information, if NMFS 
determines that catches from the 
previous year indicates that a bluefin 
tuna quota for any category or, as 
appropriate, subcategory has been 
exceeded (overharvest), NMFS may 
subtract all or a portion of the 
overharvest from that quota category or 
subcategory for the following fishing 
year. 
The 2024 adjusted bluefin tuna quota 
was 1,475.2 mt (89 FR 77029, September 
20, 2024). The total U.S. bluefin tuna 
catch (which includes landings and 
pelagic longline dead discards) in 2024 
was 1,616.4 mt. Thus, the U.S. catch 
exceeded the 2024 adjusted quota by 
141.2 mt. As such, consistent with the 
ICCAT Recommendation 22–10 and the 
regulations, NMFS is reducing the 
overall 2025 quota by 141.2 mt. 
Subtracting the total overharvest 
amount of 141.2 mt from the 2025 U.S. 
baseline quota of 1,341.14 mt (including 
the 25-mt set-aside for the NED) results 
in a total adjusted quota of 1,199.94 mt 
for 2025. 
Also, consistent with § 635.27(a)(9), 
NMFS is adjusting the subquotas of the 
categories that exceeded their quota. 
Catches by the following three bluefin 
tuna quota categories contributed to the 
2024 overharvest: 78 percent by the 
Angling category, 19 percent by the 
General category, and 3 percent by the 
Harpoon category. Applying those 
percentages to the total overharvest 
amount of 141.2 mt results in the pro 
rata reductions shown in table 4. The 
resulting 2025 adjusted quota and 
subquota allocations can be found in 
table 4.

NMFS issues this action pursuant to 
section 305(d) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act (16 U.S.C. 1855(d)) and regulations 
at 50 CFR part 635 and this action is 
exempt from review under Executive 
Order 12866. 
The AA finds that pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 553(b)(B), it is unnecessary to 
provide prior notice of, and an 
opportunity for public comment on, this 
action for the following reasons. The 
rulemaking processes for Amendment 
13 to the 2006 Consolidated HMS FMP 
(87 FR 59966, October 3, 2022), the 2022 
Atlantic bluefin tuna and northern 
albacore quota rule (87 FR 33049, June 
1, 2022), and the 2016 North and South 
Atlantic Swordfish Quota Adjustment 
Rule (81 FR 48719, July 26, 2016) 
specifically provided prior notice of, 
and accepted public comment on, the 
formulaic quota adjustment processes 
for the northern albacore, Atlantic 
bluefin tuna, and swordfish fisheries 
and the manner in which they occur. 
These processes have not changed, and 
the application of these formulas to 
adjust the relevant quotas is a routine 
action that does not have discretionary 
aspects requiring additional agency 
consideration. Additionally, similar 
actions to adjust the quotas based on 
finalized information regarding the 
previous year’s landings occur annually, 
and the regulated community expects 
such adjustments in 2025. NMFS has 
also informed fishery participants 
through various management actions 
throughout the 2025 fishing season of 
the pending quota adjustments. The 
delay that would result from 
unnecessarily soliciting public 
comments would interfere with 
management of the fisheries at issue. 
These fisheries are currently open and 
permit holders are actively fishing, and 
delay thus raises the risk that the quotas 
could be exceeded. For all of these 
reasons, it is unnecessary to provide 
prior notice and an additional 
opportunity for public comment on this 
action. 
There is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 
553(d)(3) to waive the 30-day delay in 
the date of effectiveness and to make the 
rule effective upon the date of 
publication in the Federal Register. As 
described above, this is a routine action 
that applies existing quota adjustment 
formulas, and that the regulated 
community anticipates annually. The 
2025 fisheries for northern albacore, 
North and South Atlantic swordfish, 
and bluefin tuna opened on January 1, 
2025, and end on December 31, 2025. 
As noted above, these fisheries are 
currently open, permit holders are 
actively fishing, and the adjusted quotas 
automatically revert back to the baseline 
quotas on January 1, 2026. As such, 
there is no need to delay the effective 
date of this rule’s quota adjustments. 
Any further delay would be contrary to 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act requirement 
to allow U.S. vessels reasonable 
opportunity to harvest highly migratory 
species allocations and quotas under 
relevant international fishery 
agreements such as ICCAT. 
Because prior notice and opportunity 
for public comment are not required for 
this rule by 5 U.S.C. 553, or any other 
law, the analytical requirements of the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
et seq., are inapplicable.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Regulations governing the Atlantic 
bluefish fishery are found in 50 CFR 
648.160 through 648.167. These 
regulations require annual specification 
of a commercial quota that is 
apportioned among the coastal states 
from Maine through Florida. The 
process to set the annual commercial 
quota and the percent allocated to each 
state is described in § 648.162, and the 
final 2025 allocations were published 
on December 10, 2024 (89 FR 99138). 
The final rule implementing 
amendment 1 to the FMP, as published 
in the Federal Register on July 26, 2000 
(65 FR 45844), provided a mechanism

more states, under mutual agreement 
and with the concurrence of the NMFS 
Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator, 
can request approval to transfer or 
combine bluefish commercial quota 
under § 648.162(e). The Regional 
Administrator is required to consider 
three criteria in the evaluation of 
requests for quota transfers or 
combinations: (1) the transfers would 
not preclude the overall annual quota 
from being fully harvested; (2) the 
transfers address an unforeseen 
variation or contingency in the fishery; 
and (3) the transfers are consistent with 
the objectives of the FMP and the 
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act 
(Magnuson-Stevens Act). The Regional 
Administrator has determined these 
criteria have been met for the transfers 
approved in this notification. 
New York is transferring 100,000 
pounds (lb) (45,359 kilograms (kg)) to 
North Carolina through mutual 
agreement of the states. This transfer 
was requested to ensure North Carolina 
would not exceed its 2025 state quota. 
The revised bluefish quotas for 2025 are:

Fisheries of the Northeastern United 
States; 2026 Atlantic Herring Fishery 
Specifications 
AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 
Commerce. 
ACTION: Temporary rule; inseason. SUMMARY: NMFS is finalizing the 2026 Atlantic herring specifications and river 
herring and shad catch caps for the 
Atlantic herring fishery. This action is 
necessary to implement previously 
projected 2026 Atlantic herring 
specifications, including the river 
herring and shad catch caps. This action 
is intended to achieve the objectives of 
the Atlantic Herring Fishery 
Management Plan, including preventing 
overfishing, helping rebuild an 
overfished stock, and achieving 
optimum yield on a continuing basis. 
DATES: The 2026 specifications for the Atlantic herring fishery are effective 
from January 1 through December 31, 
2026. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Carrie Nordeen, Fishery Policy Analyst, 
978–281–9272. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NMFS and the New England Fishery Management 
Council (Council) manage the Atlantic 
herring fishery pursuant to the Atlantic 
Herring Fishery Management Plan. 
Regulations at 50 CFR 648.200 require 
the Council to recommend herring 
specifications for NMFS’s approval and 
provide the Council with the discretion 
to recommend river herring and shad 
catch caps as part of the specifications. 
Prior to the start of 2026, the Council 
recommended herring specifications 
and river herring and shad catch caps 
for 2026. On December 11, 2025, NMFS 
published a final rule (90 FR 57376) 
setting the Council-recommended 2025 
herring specifications and projecting the 
2026–2027 herring specifications. 
At the end of each fishing year, NMFS 
evaluates catch information to 
determine if there were catch overages 
or unharvested catch compared to the 
annual catch limit (ACL) or the sub- 
ACLs for the herring management areas. 
If catch exceeds a sub-ACL or the ACL, 
regulations at § 648.201(a)(3) may 
require a sub-ACL or ACL deduction in 
a subsequent year. Additionally, 
regulations at § 648.201(g)(2) prohibit 
the carryover of unharvested catch to 
2026. 
NMFS reviewed 2024 fishery 
information against the projected 2026 
herring specifications. There were no 
catch overages, nor is there any new 
biological information that would 
require altering the projected 2026 
specifications published in December 
2025. Based on this information, NMFS 
is finalizing the 2026 herring 
specifications, including the river 
herring and shad catch caps, as 
projected in the December 2025 final 
rule and outlined below in tables 1 and 
2. These 2026 herring fishery 
specifications are expected to prevent 
overfishing, help rebuild an overfished 
stock, and achieve optimum yield on a 
continuing basis. NMFS will provide 
notice of the final 2027 herring fishery 
specifications, and any necessary 
adjustments, prior to the start of 2027.

NMFS issues this action pursuant to 
section 305(d) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act. This action is required by 50 CFR 
part 648, which was issued pursuant to 
section 304(b), and is exempt from 
review under Executive Order 12866. 
The Assistant Administrator for 
Fisheries, NOAA, finds good cause 
under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) to waive prior 
notice and the opportunity for public 
comment on this notice because it 
would be unnecessary and contrary to 
the public interest. The proposed rule 
for the 2025–2027 herring specifications 
(90 FR 26955; June 25, 2025), pursuant 
to the process described in the herring 
regulations (§ 648.200), provided the 
public with the opportunity to comment 
on the specifications, including the 
projected 2026 specifications and river 
herring and shad catch caps. None of 
the comments on the proposed 2025– 
2027 herring specifications resulted in 
any substantive changes in the final rule 
setting the 2025 specifications and 
projecting the 2026–2027 specifications. 
This action simply finalizes the 
projected 2026 specifications, as 
described in both the proposed and final 
rules, without changes as the proposed 
and final rules for the 2025–2027 
herring specifications provided a full 
opportunity for the public to comment 
on the projected 2026 specifications and 
the substance and process of this action. 
Additionally, the 2026 ACL (9,134 mt) 
is 64 percent higher than the current, 
adjusted 2025 ACL (5,556 mt), 
providing additional economic 
opportunity for the vessels participating 
in the herring fishery. If implementation 
of this action is delayed beyond the start 
of the fishing year on January 1, 2026, 
to solicit public comment, it may result 
in a negative economic impact on the 
herring fishing industry. Based on these 
considerations, NMFS further finds, 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C 553(d)(3), good 
cause to waive the 30-day delayed 
effectiveness period for the reasons 
stated above.

to the 2026 Gulf of Alaska Pacific Cod 
Total Allowable Catch 
AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),

ACTION: Temporary rule; inseason adjustment; request for comments. 
SUMMARY: NMFS is adjusting the 2026 total allowable catch (TAC) amounts for 
the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) Pacific cod 
fisheries. This action is necessary 
because NMFS has determined that 
these TACs are incorrectly specified and 
that the adjustments are necessary to 
ensure that harvest of Pacific cod does 
not exceed biological limits for the 
stock, as established by the best 
scientific information available for 
Pacific cod in the GOA. This action is 
consistent with the goals and objectives 
of the Fishery Management Plan for 
Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NMFS manages the groundfish fishery in the 
GOA exclusive economic zone 
according to the FMP prepared and 
recommended by the North Pacific 
Fishery Management Council (Council) 
under authority of the Magnuson- 
Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens 
Act). Regulations governing fishing by 
U.S. vessels in accordance with the FMP 
appear at subpart H of 50 CFR part 600 
and 50 CFR part 679. 
The final 2025 and 2026 harvest 
specifications for groundfish in the GOA 
set the 2026 Pacific cod TAC at 22,235 
metric tons (mt) in the GOA (90 FR 
12468, March 18, 2025). In December 
2025, the Council recommended a 2026 
Pacific cod TAC of 21,826 mt for the 
GOA, which is less than the 22,235 mt 
established by the final 2025 and 2026 
harvest specifications for groundfish in 
the GOA. The Council’s recommended 
2026 Pacific cod TAC for the GOA is 
based on the Scientific and Statistical 
Committee’s (SSC’s) overfishing limit 
(OFL) and acceptable biological catch 
(ABC) recommendations and is adjusted 
to account for the State of Alaska’s 
guideline harvest level (GHL). The GHL 
increased from 30 to 35 percent for the 
Western GOA regulatory area by the 
Alaska Board of Fisheries (BOF) in 
October 2025. There were no GHL 
changes by the BOF for the Central GOA 
or Eastern GOA regulatory areas, which 
remain at 25 percent for both areas. 
However, because the GHL increased for 
the Western GOA regulatory area, the 
Western GOA TAC and GOA wide TAC 
must be adjusted to account for that 
increase to ensure that the sum of all 
Pacific cod removals from State waters 
and Federal waters in the GOA not 
exceed the Pacific cod ABC. 
Steller sea lions occur in the same 
location as Pacific cod fisheries and are 
listed as endangered under the 
Endangered Species Act. Pacific cod are 
one of the predominant prey species for 
Steller sea lions in the GOA. 
Regulations implementing Steller sea 
lion protection measures include 
regulations at § 679.20(a)(12)(i) that 
specify, for each sector, the seasonal 
apportionment of Pacific cod TAC in the 
Western GOA and Central GOA 
regulatory areas. 
Stock assessments were not 
completed in 2025 due to the lapse in 
appropriations and resulting 
government shutdown from October 1, 
2025 through November 12, 2025. The 
SSC recommendations are informed by 
the Groundfish Plan Team’s 
recommended OFLs and ABCs from 
their November 2024 meeting as well as 
a review of the most recent Stock 
Assessment and Fishery Evaluation 
(SAFE) report dated November 2024. 
The Council’s TAC recommendations 
are based on those of its Advisory Panel, 
consistent with the SSC’s OFL and ABC 
recommendations, and reflect the most 
recent information on the State GHL and 
Pacific cod. 
In accordance with § 679.25(a)(1)(iii), 
(a)(2)(i)(A), and (a)(2)(iv), the 
Administrator, Alaska Region, NMFS 
(Regional Administrator), has 
determined that the 2026 Pacific cod 
TACs and subsequent sector allocations 
and seasonal apportionments are 
incorrectly specified and that 
adjustments are necessary to ensure that 
harvest of Pacific cod does not exceed 
biological limits for the stock. Without 
these adjustments, harvests of Pacific 
cod in State waters and Federal waters 
in the GOA could exceed the ABC 
which is equal to the annual catch limit 
and could increase the risk of 
overfishing. This determination is based 
on the November 2024 SAFE report and 
SSC recommendations for OFL and 
ABC, which is the best available 
scientific information on biological 
stock status. This determination is also 
based on TAC recommendations by the 
Council at the December 2025 meeting, 
and in consideration of the increase in 
the State GHL for the State waters 
fishery in the Western GOA regulatory 
area. The adjustments are also necessary 
to ensure that the Pacific cod TACs are 
seasonally apportioned among sectors 
consistent with Steller sea lion 
protection measures set forth in 
regulation (§ 679.20(a)(12)(i)(A) & (B)). 
Pursuant to § 679.25(a)(1)(iii), the 
Regional Administrator is adjusting the 
2026 GOA Pacific cod TAC to 21,826 
mt. Therefore, table 2 of the final 2025 
and 2026 harvest specifications for 
groundfish in the GOA (90 FR 12468, 
March 18, 2025) is revised consistent 
with this adjustment. 
Pursuant to § 679.20(a)(6)(ii) and 
(a)(12)(i), table 6 of the final 2025 and 
2026 harvest specifications for 
groundfish in the GOA (90 FR 12468, 
March 18, 2025) is revised for the 2026 
TACs of Pacific cod in the GOA.

ment found in table 13 of the final 2025 and 2026 harvest specifications for groundfish in the GOA (i.e., Final 2026 Apportionments of Rockfish Secondary Species in the Central GOA to Catcher Vessel and Catcher/Processor Cooperatives) (90 FR 12468, March 18, 2025). 
Classification 
NMFS issues this action pursuant to 
section 305(d) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act. This action is required by 50 CFR 
part 679, which was issued pursuant to 
section 304(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act, and is exempt from review under 
Executive Order 12866. 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), there 
is good cause to waive prior notice and 
an opportunity for public comment on 
this action, as notice and comment 
would be impracticable and contrary to 
the public interest, as it would prevent 
NMFS from responding to the most 
recent fisheries data and information in 
a timely fashion and would allow for 
harvests that exceed the appropriate 
allocation for Pacific cod based on the 
most recent information available. 
Without an immediate adjustment 
decreasing Pacific cod TACs, harvests of 
Pacific cod in State waters and Federal 
waters in the GOA could exceed the 
ABC, and therefore the annual catch 
limit for Pacific cod and increase the 
risk of overfishing. NMFS was unable to 
publish a notice providing time for 
public comment because the most 
recent, relevant data and information 
only became available as of December 
19, 2025. This action must be effective 
by January 1, 2026, to ensure harvests of 
Pacific cod are consistent with seasonal 
apportionments for Pacific cod that are 
based on regulations implementing 
Steller sea lion protection measures. 
Without this inseason adjustment, 
NMFS could not allow the fishery for 
Pacific cod in the GOA to be harvested 
in an expedient manner. Under 
§ 679.25(c)(2), interested persons are 
invited to submit written comments on 
this action to the above 
ADDRESSESuntil 
January 7, 2026. 
There is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 
553(d)(3) to establish an effective date 
less than 30 days after date of 
publication. This finding is based upon 
the reasons provided above for waiver of 
prior notice and opportunity for public

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NMFS manages the groundfish fishery in the 
BSAI exclusive economic zone 
according to the Fishery Management 
Plan for Groundfish of the BSAI 
Management Area (FMP) prepared and 
recommended by the North Pacific 
Fishery Management Council under 
authority of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). 
Regulations governing fishing by U.S. 
vessels in accordance with the FMP 
appear at 50 CFR part 679 and subpart 
H of 50 CFR part 600. 
The 2025 TAC for ‘‘other flatfish’’ was 
established as 5,225 metric tons (mt) by 
the final 2025 and 2026 harvest 
specifications for groundfish in the 
BSAI (90 FR 12640, March 18, 2025) 
and reapportionment of groundfish 
reserves (90 FR 27483, June 27, 2025). 
The 2025 TAC and ITAC for 
octopuses was established as 400 mt 
and 340 mt, respectively, by the final 
2025 and 2026 harvest specifications for 
groundfish in the BSAI (90 FR 12640, 
March 18, 2025). 
In accordance with § 679.20(a)(3), the 
Regional Administrator, Alaska Region, 
NMFS, has reviewed the most current 
available data and finds that the TAC for 
‘‘other flatfish’’ and octopuses needs to 
be supplemented from the nonspecified 
reserves to promote efficiency in the 
utilization of fishery resources in the 
BSAI and allow fishing operations to 
continue. 
Therefore, in accordance with 
§ 679.20(b)(3), NMFS apportions 600 mt 
from the nonspecified reserves of 
groundfish in the BSAI management 
area as follows: 500 mt to ‘‘other 
flatfish’’ and 100 mt to octopuses. This 
apportionment is authorized by 
§ 679.20(b)(1)(i) and consistent with 
§ 679.20(a)(3) and does not result in 
overfishing of any target species because 
the revised TACs are equal to or less 
than the specifications of the acceptable 
biological catch for ‘‘other flatfish’’ and 
octopuses in the final 2025 and 2026 
harvest specifications for groundfish in 
the BSAI (90 FR 12640, March 18, 
2025). 
The harvest specifications for the 
2025 TACs included in the final 2025 
and 2026 harvest specifications for 
groundfish in the BSAI is revised as 
follows: 5,725 mt for ‘‘other flatfish’’ 
and 440 mt for octopuses. 
Classification 
NMFS issues this action pursuant to 
section 305(d) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act. This action is required by 50 CFR 
part 679, which was issued pursuant to 
section 304(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act, and is exempt from review under 
Executive Order 12866. 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), there 
is good cause to waive prior notice and 
an opportunity for public comment on 
this action, as notice and comment 
would be impracticable and contrary to 
the public interest, as it would prevent 
NMFS from responding to the most 
recent fisheries data in a timely fashion 
and would delay the apportionment of 
the nonspecified reserves of groundfish 
to ‘‘other flatfish’’ and octopuses. This 
action is necessary for the efficient 
utilization of fishery resources in the 
BSAI and to allow the fisheries 
harvesting these groundfish to continue 
operating. NMFS was unable to publish 
a notice providing time for public 
comment because the most recent, 
relevant data on catch of ‘‘other flatfish’’ 
and octopuses only became available as 
of December 19, 2025. Finally, NMFS 
provided notice and an opportunity for 
public comment on the proposed 2025 
and 2026 harvest specifications for 
groundfish in the BSAI that included 
the amount of proposed nonspecified 
reserves from which NMFS can 
apportion to any target species that 
contributed to that reserve (89 FR 
96186, December 4, 2024). The final 
2025 and 2026 harvest specifications for 
groundfish in the BSAI explained that, 
during the fishing year, any amount of 
the nonspecified reserve may be 
apportioned by NMFS to a target species 
that contributed to the nonspecified 
reserves consistent with § 679.20(b)(1)(i) 
(90 FR 12640, March 18, 2025). 
There is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 
553(d)(3) to make this action effective 
immediately upon filing with the Office 
of the Federal Register. This finding is 
based upon the reasons provided above 
for waiver of prior notice and 
opportunity for public comment. 
Under § 679.20(b)(3)(iii), interested 
persons are invited to submit written

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NMFS manages the groundfish fishery in the 
BSAI exclusive economic zone 
according to the FMP prepared and 
recommended by the North Pacific 
Fishery Management Council (Council) 
under authority of the Magnuson- 
Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens 
Act). Regulations governing fishing by 
U.S. vessels in accordance with the FMP 
appear at subpart H of 50 CFR 600 and 
50 CFR part 679. 
The final 2025 and 2026 harvest 
specifications for groundfish in the 
BSAI (90 FR 12640, March 18, 2025) set 
the 2026 AI Pacific cod TAC at 8,432 
mt. In December 2025, the Council 
recommended a 2026 AI Pacific cod 
TAC of 8,951 mt, which is more than 
the AI Pacific cod TAC of 8,432 mt 
established for 2026 by the final 2025 
and 2026 harvest specifications for 
groundfish in the BSAI. This increase in 
TAC accounts for a reduction in the 
guideline harvest level (GHL) set for the 
State of Alaska (State) waters Pacific cod 
fishery in the AI. The AI Pacific cod 
TAC accounts for the State GHL for 
Pacific cod to ensure that the sum of all 
State and Federal Pacific cod removals 
do not exceed the acceptable biological 
catch (ABC) set for AI Islands Pacific 
cod. 
Steller sea lions occur in the same 
location as the Pacific cod fisheries and 
are listed as endangered under the 
Endangered Species Act. Pacific cod is 
a principal prey species for Steller sea 
lions in the BSAI. NMFS published 
regulations and the revised harvest limit 
amount for Pacific cod fisheries to 
implement Steller sea lion protection 
measures to ensure that groundfish 
fisheries of the BSAI are not likely to 
jeopardize the continued existence of 
the western distinct population segment 
of Steller sea lions or destroy or 
adversely modify their designated 
critical habitat (79 FR 70286, November 
25, 2014). These measures include 
regulations requiring the seasonal 
apportionment of Pacific cod harvest 
and the specification of an Area 543 
Pacific cod harvest limit. To calculate 
the Area 543 Pacific cod harvest limit, 
NMFS first subtracts the State GHL 
Pacific cod amount from the AI Pacific 
cod ABC. Then NMFS determines the 
harvest limit in Area 543 by multiplying 
the percentage of Pacific cod estimated 
in Area 543 by the remaining ABC for 
AI Pacific cod. 
Stock assessments were not 
completed in 2025 due to the lapse in 
appropriations and resulting 
government shutdown from October 1, 
2025 through November 12, 2025. The 
Scientific and Statistical Committee 
(SSC) recommendations are informed by 
the Groundfish Plan Team’s 
recommended overfishing limits (OFLs) 
and ABCs from their November 2024 
meeting as well as a review of the most 
recent Stock Assessment and Fishery 
Evaluation (SAFE) report dated 
November 2024. The Council’s TAC 
recommendations are based on those of 
its Advisory Panel, consistent with the 
SSC’s OFL and ABC recommendations, 
and reflect the most recent information 
on the State GHL and Pacific cod. 
In accordance with § 679.25(a)(1)(iii), 
(a)(2)(i)(C), and (a)(2)(iv), the 
Administrator, Alaska Region, NMFS 
(Regional Administrator), has 
determined that the 2026 AI Pacific cod 
TAC and subsequent BSAI Pacific cod 
sector allocations and seasonal 
apportionments are incorrectly specified 
and that adjustments are necessary to 
address the underharvest of BSAI 
Pacific cod that could occur if the AI 
Pacific cod TAC and BSAI Pacific cod 
sector allocations are not increased 
consistent with the TAC 
recommendations by the Council at the 
December 2025 meeting. This 
determination is based on the November 
2024 SAFE report and the TAC 
recommendations by the Council at the 
December 2025 meeting, and in 
consideration of the change in the State 
GHL for the State waters fishery in the 
AI and the regulations implementing the 
Steller sea lion protection measures. 
The adjustment to the AI Pacific cod 
TAC is also necessary to ensure that the 
BSAI Pacific cod TACs are seasonally 
apportioned among sectors consistent 
with the Steller sea lion protection 
measures and that the Area 543 Pacific 
cod harvest limit, which is based on 
Pacific cod abundance in Area 543, is 
correctly specified. These adjustments 
are based upon the best available 
scientific information concerning the 
biological stock status of AI Pacific cod. 
Pursuant to § 679.25(a)(1)(iii), the 
Regional Administrator is adjusting the 
2026 AI Pacific cod TAC to 8,951 mt. 
Therefore, table 2 of the final 2025 and 
2026 harvest specifications for 
groundfish in the BSAI (90 FR 12640, 
March 18, 2025) is revised consistent 
with this adjustment. 
Pursuant to § 679.20(a)(7), table 10 of 
the final 2025 and 2026 harvest 
specifications for groundfish in the 
BSAI (90 FR 12640, March 18, 2025) is 
revised for the 2026 sector allocations 
and seasonal allowances of the BSAI 
Pacific cod TAC, Community 
Development Quota (CDQ) Program 
directed fishing allowances (DFAs), and 
Pacific Cod Trawl Cooperative (PCTC) 
Program DFAs consistent with this 
adjustment.

The sector allocations and seasonal allowances for BSAI Pacific cod TAC are based on the sum of the BS and AI Pacific cod TACs, after 
subtraction of the reserves for the CDQ Program. If the TAC for Pacific cod in either the BS or AI is or will be reached, then directed fishing will 
be prohibited for non-CDQ Pacific cod in that subarea, even if a BSAI allowance remains (§ 679.20(d)(1)(iii)). 
2
The incidental catch allowance (ICA) for the hook-and-line and pot sectors will be deducted from the aggregate portion of Pacific cod TAC al-
located to the hook-and-line and pot sectors. The Regional Administrator sets an ICA of 500 mt based on anticipated incidental catch by these 
sectors in other fisheries. 
3
The A and B season trawl CV Pacific cod allocation will be allocated to the PCTC Program after subtraction of the A and B season ICAs 
(§ 679.131(b)(1)). Section 679.131(b)(1)(i) requires NMFS to establish an ICA for incidental catch of Pacific cod by trawl CVs engaged in di-
rected fishing for groundfish other than PCTC Program Pacific cod. The Regional Administrator sets for the A and B seasons, ICAs of 1,500 mt 
and 600 mt, respectively, to account for projected incidental catch of Pacific cod by trawl catcher vessels engaged in directed fishing for ground-
fish other than PCTC Program Pacific cod.

includes redesigned replacement flap 
control pushrod assemblies that have 
been modified to prevent interference 
with adjacent parts. The FAA is 
proposing this airworthiness directive 
(AD) to address the unsafe condition on 
these products. Since these actions 
would impose an additional burden 
over those in the NPRM, the agency is 
requesting comments on this SNPRM. 
DATES: The FAA must receive comments on this SNPRM by February 6, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: You may send comments, using the procedures found in 14 CFR

will consider all comments received by 
the closing date and may again revise 
the proposal because of those 
comments. 
Except for Confidential Business 
Information (CBI) as described in the 
following paragraph, and other 
information as described in 14 CFR 
11.35, the FAA will post all comments 
received, without change, to 
regulations.gov, including any personal information you provide. The agency 
will also post a report summarizing each 
substantive verbal contact received 
about this SNPRM. 
Confidential Business Information 
CBI is commercial or financial 
information that is both customarily and 
actually treated as private by its owner. 
Under the Freedom of Information Act 
(FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), CBI is exempt 
from public disclosure. If your 
comments responsive to this SNPRM 
contain commercial or financial 
information that is customarily treated 
as private, that you actually treat as 
private, and that is relevant or 
responsive to this SNPRM, it is 
important that you clearly designate the 
submitted comments as CBI. Please 
mark each page of your submission 
containing CBI as ‘‘PROPIN.’’ The FAA 
will treat such marked submissions as 
confidential under the FOIA, and they 
will not be placed in the public docket 
of this SNPRM. Submissions containing 
CBI should be sent to Kelly Fichter, 
Aviation Safety Engineer, FAA, 701 
Columbia Avenue, College Park, GA 
30337. Any commentary that the FAA 
receives which is not specifically 
designated as CBI will be placed in the 
public docket for this rulemaking. 
Background 
The FAA issued AD 2021–22–12, 
Amendment 39–21785 (86 FR 60753, 
November 4, 2021) (AD 2021–22–12), 
for certain Honda Model HA–420 
airplanes. AD 2021–22–12 requires 
removing and cleaning the inner 
diameter of the flap control pushrod 
assembly and repetitively applying 
corrosion inhibiting compound (CIC) to 
this area. The FAA issued AD 2021–22– 
12 to prevent failure of the flap control 
pushrod assembly, which, if not 
addressed, could result in uncontrolled 
and un-annunciated flap asymmetry 
with consequent loss of control of the 
airplane. 
The FAA issued an NPRM to amend 
14 CFR part 39 by adding an AD to 
supersede AD 2021–22–12 that would 
have applied to certain serial-numbered 
Honda Model HA–420 airplanes. The 
NPRM was published in the Federal 
Register on April 11, 2025 (90 FR 15426). The NPRM was prompted by a 
report that the flap pushrod assemblies 
are susceptible to corrosion, and the 
subsequent development of updated 
flap control pushrod assemblies that are 
more corrosion resistant and do not 
require repetitive CIC applications. In 
the NPRM, the FAA proposed to 
continue to require removing and 
cleaning the inner diameter of the flap 
control pushrod assembly and 
repetitively applying CIC to this area.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS60030 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules The NPRM also proposed to expand the 
applicability to include additional 
airplanes and require replacing the flap 
control pushrod assemblies with new 
corrosion-resistant flap control pushrod 
assemblies. 
Actions Since the NPRM Was Issued 
Since the FAA issued the NPRM, it 
was discovered that the updated 
outboard corrosion resistant pushrods 
could interfere with the mid flap drive 
arms when fully deployed. As a result 
of this finding, the manufacturer 
published updated service material that 
includes a modified design of the flap 
control pushrod assembly to prevent 
interference with adjacent parts. The 
FAA is proposing this AD to address the 
unsafe condition on these products. 
Comments 
The FAA received one comment on 
the NPRM from an individual. The 
commenter supported the NPRM 
without change. 
FAA’s Determination 
The FAA is proposing this AD after 
determining the unsafe condition 
described previously is likely to exist or 
develop in other products of the same 
type design. Certain changes described 
above expand the scope of the NPRM. 
As a result, it is necessary to reopen the 
comment period to provide additional 
opportunity for the public to comment 
on this SNPRM. 
Material Incorporated by Reference 
Under 1 CFR Part 51 
The FAA reviewed Honda Aircraft 
Company Alert Service Bulletin No. SB– 
420–27–009, Revision B, dated August 
5, 2025. This material specifies 
procedures for replacing the flap control 
pushrod assemblies with improved 
design flap control pushrod assemblies. 
This proposed AD would also require 
Honda Aircraft Company Alert Service 
Bulletin No. SB–420–27–008, dated 
August 31, 2021, which the Director of 
the Federal Register approved for 
incorporation by reference as of 
November 19, 2021 (86 FR 60753, 
November 4, 2021). 
This material is reasonably available 
because the interested parties have 
access to it through their normal course 
of business or by the means identified 
in the 
ADDRESSESsection. 
Proposed AD Requirements in This 
SNPRM 
This proposed AD would retain all of 
the requirements of AD 2021–22–12. 
This proposed AD would also expand 
the applicability to include additional 
airplanes and require replacing the flap 
control pushrod assemblies with new 
corrosion-resistant flap control pushrod 
assemblies as terminating action for the 
repetitive CIC applications required by 
AD 2021–22–12. 
Costs of Compliance 
The FAA estimates that this AD, if 
adopted as proposed, would affect 107 
airplanes of U.S. registry. 
The FAA estimates the following 
costs to comply with this proposed AD: 
ESTIMATEDCOSTS 
Action Labor cost Parts 
cost 
Cost per 
product 
Cost on U.S. 
operators 
Remove, clean, and apply CIC to the flap control 
pushrod assembly (retained from AD 2021–22–12).
22 work-hours × $85 per hour = $1,870.
$70  $1,940  $85,360 (44 airplanes). 
Reapply CIC every 90 days (cost for each time) (re-
tained from AD 2021–22–12).
1 work-hour × $85 per hour = $85.
70  155  $6,820 (44 airplanes). 
Replace the left and right inboard flap control pushrod 
assemblies.
22 work-hours × $85 per hour = $1,870.
5,168  7,038  $753,066 (107 airplanes). 
The FAA has included all known 
costs in its cost estimate. According to 
the manufacturer, however, some or all 
of the costs of this proposed AD may be 
covered under warranty, thereby 
reducing the cost impact on affected 
operators. 
Authority for This Rulemaking 
Title 49 of the United States Code 
specifies the FAA’s authority to issue 
rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, 
section 106, describes the authority of 
the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: 
Aviation Programs describes in more 
detail the scope of the Agency’s 
authority. 
The FAA is issuing this rulemaking 
under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 
44701: General requirements. Under 
that section, Congress charges the FAA 
with promoting safe flight of civil 
aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
regulations for practices, methods, and 
procedures the Administrator finds 
necessary for safety in air commerce. 
This regulation is within the scope of 
that authority because it addresses an 
unsafe condition that is likely to exist or 
develop on products identified in this 
rulemaking action. 
Regulatory Findings 
The FAA determined that this 
proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 
13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the 
States, on the relationship between the 
national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
For the reasons discussed above, I 
certify this proposed regulation: 
(1) Is not a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ under Executive Order 12866, 
(2) Would not affect intrastate 
aviation in Alaska, and 
(3) Would not have a significant 
economic impact, positive or negative, 
on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act.

Under the Freedom of Information Act 
(FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), CBI is exempt 
from public disclosure. If your 
comments responsive to this NPRM 
contain commercial or financial 
information that is customarily treated 
as private, that you actually treat as 
private, and that is relevant or 
responsive to this NPRM, it is important 
that you clearly designate the submitted 
comments as CBI. Please mark each 
page of your submission containing CBI 
as ‘‘PROPIN.’’ The FAA will treat such 
marked submissions as confidential 
under the FOIA, and they will not be 
placed in the public docket of this 
NPRM. Submissions containing CBI 
should be sent to Joseph Catanzaro, 
Aviation Safety Engineer, FAA, 1600 
Stewart Avenue, Suite 410, Westbury, 
NY 11590. Any commentary that the

designated as CBI will be placed in the 
public docket for this rulemaking. 
Background 
The FAA issued AD 2020–14–06, 
Amendment 39–21160 (85 FR 42687, 
July 15, 2020) (AD 2020–14–06), for DAI 
Model DA 40, DA 40 F, and DA 40 NG 
airplanes (including Model DA 40 NG 
airplanes that have been converted from 
the Model DA 40 D), all serial numbers, 
certificated in any category. AD 2020– 
14–06 was prompted by AD CF–2019– 
39, dated October 31, 2019 (Transport 
Canada AD CF–2019–39) issued by 
Transport Canada, which is the aviation 
authority for Canada. Transport Canada 
issued Transport Canada AD CF–2019– 
39 to correct an unsafe condition 
identified as fuel tank connection hose 
deterioration. 
AD 2020–14–06 requires replacing 
affected parts, inspecting the fuel tank 
chambers, and removing rubber material 
that has detached from the fuel tank 
connection hoses. AD 2020–14–06 also 
prohibits installing an affected part on 
any airplane. The FAA issued AD 2020– 
14–06 to detect deterioration of fuel 
tank connection hoses, which, if not 
corrected, could result in contamination 
of the fuel system and restriction of fuel 
flow, and could lead to fuel starvation 
and reduced control of the airplane. 
Actions Since AD 2020–14–06 Was 
Issued 
Since the FAA issued AD 2020–14– 
06, Transport Canada superseded 
Transport Canada AD CF–2019–39 and 
issued Transport Canada AD CF–2019– 
39R1, dated May 21, 2025 (also referred 
to as the MCAI). The MCAI states that 
since the issuance of Transport Canada 
AD CF–2019–39, Transport Canada has 
received reports of affected parts 
installed during production on DAI 
Model DA 40 NG airplanes. As a result, 
the manufacturer published updated 
service material for the Model DA 40 
NG. The MCAI also continues to require 
replacing affected fuel tank connection 
hoses, inspecting the fuel tank 
chambers, and removing rubber material 
that has detached from the fuel tank 
connection hoses. 
You may examine the MCAI in the 
AD docket at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA–2025–5397. 
Material Incorporated by Reference 
Under 1 CFR Part 51 
The FAA reviewed Diamond Aircraft 
Industries Mandatory Service Bulletin 
No. MSB 40NG–064 Rev. 3, dated 
January 23, 2025, which specifies 
procedures for replacing affected parts, 
inspecting the fuel tank chambers, and 
removing rubber material that has 
detached from the hoses. This material 
also specifies the service centers from 
which the affected parts could have 
been obtained, and the serial numbers 
for additional DAI Model DA 40 NG 
airplanes that are affected by the unsafe 
condition and were not in the previous 
version of the material. 
This proposed AD would also require 
the following Diamond Aircraft 
Industries Mandatory Service Bulletins, 
which the Director of the Federal

FAA’s Determination 
These products have been approved 
by the civil aviation authority of another 
country and are approved for operation 
in the United States. Pursuant to the 
FAA’s bilateral agreement with this 
State of Design Authority, that authority 
has notified the FAA of the unsafe 
condition described in the MCAI and 
material referenced above. The FAA is 
issuing this NPRM after determining 
that the unsafe condition described 
previously is likely to exist or develop 
on other products of the same type 
design. 
Proposed AD Requirements in This 
NPRM 
This proposed AD would require the 
same actions as AD 2020–14–06 and 
would require updated material to be 
used for the Model DA 40 NG airplanes. 
Costs of Compliance 
The FAA estimates that this AD, if 
adopted as proposed, would affect 987 
airplanes of U.S. registry. 
The FAA estimates the following 
costs to comply with this proposed AD: 
ESTIMATEDCOSTS 
Action Labor cost Parts cost Cost per 
product 
Cost on U.S. 
operators 
Inspect the fuel tank chambers ........................ 1 work-hour × $85 per hour = $85 ................... $0  $85  $83,895 Remove detached rubber material ................... 5 work hours × $85 per hour = $425 ............... 0  425  419,475 Replace fuel tank connection hose .................. 10 work hours × $85 per hour = $850 .............383  1,233  1,216,971 The FAA has included all known 
costs in its cost estimate. According to 
the manufacturer, however, some of the 
costs of this proposed AD may be 
covered under warranty, thereby 
reducing the cost impact on affected 
operators. 
Authority for This Rulemaking 
Title 49 of the United States Code 
specifies the FAA’s authority to issue 
rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, 
section 106, describes the authority of 
the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII, 
Aviation Programs, describes in more 
detail the scope of the Agency’s 
authority. 
The FAA is issuing this rulemaking 
under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 
44701: General requirements. Under 
that section, Congress charges the FAA 
with promoting safe flight of civil 
aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
regulations for practices, methods, and 
procedures the Administrator finds 
necessary for safety in air commerce. 
This regulation is within the scope of 
that authority because it addresses an 
unsafe condition that is likely to exist or 
develop on products identified in this 
rulemaking action. 
Regulatory Findings 
The FAA determined that this 
proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 
13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the 
States, on the relationship between the 
national Government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
For the reasons discussed above, I 
certify that the proposed regulation: 
(1) Is not a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ under Executive Order 12866, 
(2) Would not affect intrastate 
aviation in Alaska, and 
(3) Would not have a significant 
economic impact, positive or negative, 
on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act.

The Proposed Amendment 
Accordingly, under the authority 
delegated to me by the Administrator, 
the FAA proposes to amend 14 CFR part 
39 as follows:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
Legal Authorities. The Debt Collection 
Improvement Act of 1996 (‘‘DCIA’’), 
Public Law 104–134, 110 Stat. 1321–358 
et seq. (April 26, 1996), among other 
things, authorized Federal disbursing 
officials to withhold eligible Federal 
payments to pay the payee’s delinquent 
nontax debt owed to the United States. 
See 31 U.S.C. 3716(c). The DCIA also provided that Federal nontax payments 
may be offset to collect delinquent debts 
owed to States, including past-due 
support, and that payments made by 
States may be offset to collect 
delinquent debts owed to the United 
States. See 31 U.S.C. 3716(h). In addition, the DCIA requires Federal 
agencies to identify Federal employees 
who owe delinquent nontax debts to the 
United States. See 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1). Further, Federal tax refund payments 
may be offset to collect nontax debt 
owed to the United States and debts 
owed to States, including past-due 
support. See 26 U.S.C. 6402, 31 U.S.C. 3720A, and 42 U.S.C. 664. The 
Supporting America’s Children and 
Families Act, Public Law 118–258 (Jan. 
4, 2025), also permits the offset of tax 
refund payments to collect past-due 
support owed to certain Federally 
recognized Tribes. See 26 U.S.C. 6402(c) and 42 U.S.C. 664. 
Treasury Offset Program. Fiscal 
Service administers a centralized offset 
program, known as the Treasury Offset 
Program, or TOP, through which it 
exercises these legal authorities. In 
general, TOP works as follows: 
(1) Creditor agencies submit 
information about delinquent debts to 
Fiscal Service, which maintains the 
information in its delinquent debtor 
database. The information submitted 
includes the name and taxpayer 
identifying number (‘‘TIN’’) of the 
debtor. (2) Payment agencies prepare 
and certify payments to Fiscal Service 
and disbursing officials at other Federal 
agencies. Each payment record contains 
information about the payment, 
including the name and TIN of the 
person entitled to payment. The 
disbursing official examines the 
payment records to determine if they 
meet the requirements for disbursement. 
If so, the disbursing official then 
disburses the payments in accordance 
with the payment agencies’ instructions, 
subject to any eligible offset or levy. (3) 
Before an eligible Federal payment is 
disbursed, Fiscal Service compares 
information about persons who are 
entitled to Federal payments against a 
database of persons who owe delinquent 
debts. When a match occurs and all the 
prerequisites for offset have been met, 
the payment is offset to satisfy the debt, 
to the extent legally allowed. Fiscal 
Service also has agreements with certain 
States, whereby it collects nontax debts 
owed to the United States through the 
offset of certain payments disbursed by 
those States. (4) Fiscal Service transmits 
amounts collected through offset to the 
appropriate creditor agencies after 
deducting fees, which Fiscal Service 
charges the creditor agencies to cover 
the cost of operating the offset program. 
Re-write of Existing Regulations. 
Fiscal Service promulgated 31 CFR part 
285, subpart A (the ‘‘existing TOP 
regulations’’) to implement the 
administrative offset of payments 
pursuant to the authorities listed above. 
The several sections within the existing 
TOP regulations were promulgated (and 
revised) at different times. Fiscal 
Service proposes to revise the existing 
TOP regulations for several reasons, 
including to: (1) restore statutory 
flexibility that was unnecessarily 
restricted; (2) implement new 
authorities; (3) eliminate repetitive and 
unnecessary language; (4) reword 
certain provisions for clarity, consistent 
with the requirements of the Plain 
Writing Act of 2010 and Executive 
Order 12866 (Sept. 1993); and (5) better 
organize the regulations for easier 
comprehension. 
II. Section Analysis 
This section describes, section-by- 
section, the reasoning for the proposed 
revision (the ‘‘proposed rule’’) of the 
existing TOP regulations. To the extent 
a proposed provision is substantively 
consistent with the existing TOP 
regulations, this section does not repeat 
the reasoning for the provision as such 
explanations are described in Federal 
Register entries for prior rulemakings. To the extent a proposed provision is 
substantively consistent with the 
existing TOP regulations, we have 
described them as being ‘‘consistent’’ 
with the existing TOP regulations, even 
if wording changes were required due to 
the reorganization of subpart A or if 
changes were made for clarity or 
consistency. 
Redesignation of Subpart B and Its 
Included Sections 
To accommodate the reorganization of 
subpart A, the sections of subpart B 
require redesignation. Sections 285.11 
through 285.13 are proposed to be 
redesignated as §§ 285.111 through 
285.113, respectively. No changes to the 
content of subpart B are proposed. 
Section 285.1—Definitions 
The existing TOP regulations contain 
separate definition sections for each 
type of offset; certain terms are defined 
in more than one definition section, at 
times using slightly different 
definitions. The definitions in the new 
definitions section would apply to all 
types of offset. This will ensure 
consistency and clarity and avoid 
unnecessary repetition. The definitions 
used in this section would apply to 31 
CFR part 285, subpart A only. For 
example, whether a debt is ‘‘legally 
enforceable’’ for purposes of centralized 
offset has no bearing on whether the 
debt is legally enforceable for purposes 
of placing a lien on the debtor’s 
property or for some other debt 
collection purpose. 
Address. This term is used but not defined in the existing TOP regulations. 
The proposed definition clarifies that 
due process notices and offset notices 
can be sent via first class mail, email, 
text message, or other reasonable means. 
Agencies should determine that the 
method used for delivering information 
to an address is consistent with relevant 
law and security policies. With regard to 
due process notices, agencies should 
also determine that the address used to 
send notice is reasonably calculated to 
reach the debtor. This definition’s broad 
view of the term ‘‘address’’ does not 
require an agency to use non-traditional 
means of mail. 
Centralized offset. The proposed 
definition is consistent with the existing 
TOP regulations. It refers to offsets 
conducted to collect debts that have 
been referred to TOP and includes 
TOP’s processing of offsets of Federal 
payments (whether disbursed by Fiscal 
Service or by another disbursing 
official) and State payments. This term 
excludes offsets conducted by the 
payment agency prior to disbursement 
(e.g., internal offsets conducted by the payment agency before the payment 
agency certifies the payment for 
disbursement). 
Covered benefit payment. This term is 
similar to the term in the existing TOP 
regulations. However, some concepts 
that were included in the definition for 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:12 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\23DEP1.SGM 23DEP1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS60036 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules ‘‘covered benefit payment’’ have now 
been moved to more logical places 
within the proposed rule. 
Creditor agency. The proposed 
definition includes Federal agencies and 
States that seek to collect debts through 
TOP. The term also includes Indian 
Tribes and Tribal organizations that 
receive funding under section 455(f) of 
the Social Security Act (‘‘Tribal IV–D 
agencies’’) in the context of tax refund 
offset to collect past-due support. The 
term also includes agencies acting on 
behalf of the creditor agency. For 
example, where there is a requirement 
that the creditor agency take some 
action, such as providing notice or 
informing Fiscal Service as to changes 
in the status of a debt previously 
referred to TOP, such actions may be 
taken on behalf of the creditor agency 
(including, for example, through Fiscal 
Service’s Cross-Servicing program). 
Days delinquent. This term is not 
defined in the existing TOP regulations. 
The proposed definition clarifies when 
Federal agencies must refer their debts 
to TOP (i.e., by when the debt is over 120 days delinquent) and is consistent 
with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 
3716(c)(6)(A). For administrative (i.e., 
non-loan) debts, for example, the 
delinquency clock generally begins 
running from the date of the initial 
demand for payment. The fact that a 
debt is in a delinquent status does not 
necessarily mean that there are 
immediate adverse consequences (e.g., 
late charges) to the debtor. For 
administrative debts, there is typically a 
30-day grace period from the date of 
initial demand for payment (i.e., day one of delinquency to day 30 of 
delinquency) before there are adverse 
consequences due to delinquency (see 
31 CFR 901.2(b)(3)). For loan debts to be 
re-paid in installments pursuant to a 
promissory note, each missed payment 
generally constitutes a delinquent debt, 
until all amounts owed are accelerated 
into a single debt. 
Debt. The proposed definition is generally consistent with the existing 
TOP regulations, but also now 
distinguishes between ‘‘Federal debt’’ 
and ‘‘State debt.’’ It also adds past-due 
support owed to a Tribal IV–D agency. 
Debt record. The proposed definition 
encompasses the terms ‘‘record of debt,’’ 
‘‘debt record,’’ ‘‘debtor record,’’ 
‘‘delinquent debtor record,’’ and 
‘‘delinquent debt record,’’ as used in the 
existing TOP regulations. 
Debtor. The proposed definition harmonizes the definition of ‘‘debtor’’ 
across the different types of offset. 
Depending on the type of offset 
involved, a debtor can be a person who 
owes a debt to a Federal agency, a State, 
or a Tribal IV–D agency. 
Delinquent or past-due. The proposed 
definition is consistent with the existing 
TOP regulations. However, this 
definition clarifies that not all payment 
arrangements avoid or cure 
delinquency. For example, a debt’s 
delinquent status is generally not 
altered by a due date in a post- 
delinquency payment agreement. A 
post-delinquency payment agreement 
should only restart the clock on 
delinquency if the agreement explicitly 
cures the delinquency. Many post- 
delinquency payment agreements used 
by Fiscal Service in its Cross-Servicing 
program (see 31 CFR 285.12, proposed to be redesignated as 31 CFR 285.112), 
for example, are not meant to cure 
delinquency, but are meant to provide 
relief from certain types of collection 
actions. Also see the definition of ‘‘Days 
delinquent.’’ As another example, an 
administrative debt generally is 
delinquent as of the date of the agency’s 
initial demand for payment, even if the 
agency provides a thirty-day grace 
period in which to pay the debt. 
However, the agency generally may take 
no adverse action to collect the debt 
(such as through TOP) until after the 
grace period. If the debt is not paid by 
the end of the grace period, it will 
generally be deemed to have been 
delinquent as of the date of the agency’s 
initial demand for payment. 
Disbursing official. The proposed 
definition is consistent with the existing 
TOP regulations. 
Disposable pay. The proposed 
definition is consistent with the existing 
TOP regulations. 
Federal agency. The proposed 
definition is intended to distinguish 
between Federal agencies, States, and 
Tribal IV–D agencies. The existing TOP 
regulations use the term ‘‘agency,’’ 
which can be ambiguous when talking 
about Federal agencies, State agencies, 
and Tribal IV–D agencies. 
Federal benefit payment. This term is 
not defined in the existing TOP 
regulations. The proposed definition is 
intended to distinguish between 
amounts a debtor may receive under 
‘‘Federal benefit programs cited under 
clause (i) within a 12-month period’’ 
and ‘‘all Federal benefit payments made 
during such 12-month period.’’ See 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(3)(ii). 
Federal debt or Federal nontax debt. The proposed definition is consistent 
with the existing TOP regulations. 
Federal employee. The proposed 
definition is consistent with the existing 
TOP regulations. 
Federally recognized Tribe. This term 
is not used or defined in the existing 
TOP regulations. The existing TOP 
regulations use the term ‘‘Indian tribe.’’ 
This definition is added for clarity. 
Federal nontax payment. This term is 
not defined in the existing TOP 
regulations. The proposed definition is 
intended to more clearly distinguish 
between types of payments. 
Federal payment. This term is used 
but not defined in the existing TOP 
regulations. The proposed definition is 
consistent with the statutory text and 
current operational practice. The term 
‘‘administrative offset’’ is defined by 
statute as ‘‘withholding funds payable 
by the United States . . . to, or held by 
the United States for, a person to satisfy 
a claim.’’ 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1). Agencies 
are permitted to collect their debts by 
‘‘administrative offset.’’ 31 U.S.C. 
3716(a). And, disbursing officials are 
required to offset ‘‘the amount of a 
payment which a payment certifying 
agency has certified to the disbursing 
official for disbursement.’’ 31 U.S.C. 
3716(c)(1)(A). 
Given the language of the applicable 
statutes, Fiscal Service has consistently 
taken the position that any payment that 
is certified to a disbursing official is 
subject to administrative offset, unless 
the payment is otherwise exempt from 
offset. The proposed definition makes 
clear that the source of funds for a 
payment, such as whether the payment 
is made from public funds or funds held 
in trust, has no bearing on whether the 
payment is a ‘‘Federal payment.’’ 
The proposed definition also makes 
clear that the term ‘‘Federal payment’’ 
includes any payment made by the 
United States through an escrow agent 
or other person with the responsibility 
to hold and/or further disburse the 
funds to a person.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS60037 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules the offset of benefit payments that are 
paid as a lump sum. Under the 
proposed rule, offset of one-time 
payments of benefits that have accrued 
over a period of more than one month 
can be offset by no more than 15% and 
must leave a minimum floor (see 
proposed § 285.30(c)(2)(viii)). The 
existing TOP regulations do not clearly 
address how the $9,000 floor (required 
by 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(3)(A)(ii)) should be 
applied for lump-sum benefit payments 
and how it should be prorated. The 
proposed rule explains how the floor 
should be calculated. 
Because the statute, in establishing 
the offset floor, refers to the amount that 
a debtor may ‘‘receive’’ under the 
specified Federal benefit programs 
within a 12-month period, Fiscal 
Service determined that the floor for a 
lump-sum benefit payment should 
generally be the lesser of: (1) $9,000; or 
(2) an amount equal to $750 times the 
number of months’ worth of benefits 
represented by the lump-sum benefit 
payment. While the floor should 
generally be the lower amount of those 
two calculations, Fiscal Service may 
select the first option when it lacks 
sufficient information to calculate the 
second option or when it is more 
administratively feasible to do so. 
The calculation of the floor can be 
further complicated in the event the 
person entitled to payment was 
receiving other amounts as Federal 
benefit payments; in such 
circumstances, Fiscal Service can 
reduce the floor by those other amounts, 
if it determines that it is 
administratively feasible and otherwise 
appropriate to do so. 
The following examples demonstrate 
how this calculation would work: 
Example #1: If a debtor is being paid 
a lump-sum benefit payment of $10,000, 
representing 13 months of accrued 
benefit payments, and was not receiving 
any other Federal benefit payments, the 
offset floor would be $9,000, calculated 
as the lesser of: (1) $9,000; or (2) $750 
times 13 (i.e., $9,750). Because taking an offset of 15% of the $10,000 payment 
(i.e., $1,500) would reduce the payment below the lump-sum benefit payment 
floor (i.e., $10,000 minus $1,500 is less than $9,000), the offset would be $1,000 
(i.e., $10,000 minus $9,000). Example #2: If a debtor is being paid 
a lump-sum benefit payment of $6,000, 
representing 3 months of accrued 
benefit payments, and was not receiving 
any other Federal benefit payments, the 
offset floor would be $2,250, calculated 
as the lesser of: (1) $9,000; or (2) $750 
times 3 (i.e., $2,250). Because taking an offset of 15% of the payment (i.e., $900) would not reduce the payment below 
the lump-sum benefit payment floor 
(i.e., $6,000 minus $900 is more than $2,250), the offset amount would be 
$900. 
Example #3: If a debtor is being paid 
a lump-sum benefit payment of $10,000, 
representing an unknown number of 
months of accrued benefit payments, 
and had received $8,000 of OPM 
annuity payments over the past 12 
months, the lump-sum benefit payment 
floor would be $1,000, calculated as the 
lesser of: (1) $9,000; or (2) $750 times 
12 minus $8,000 (i.e., $1,000). Because taking an offset of 15% of the payment 
(i.e., $1,500) would not reduce the payment below the lump-sum benefit 
payment floor (i.e., $10,000 minus $1,000 is more than $1,000), the offset 
amount would be $1,500. 
Lump-sum benefit payment floor. 
This term is not defined in the existing 
TOP regulations. See the proposed 
definition for ‘‘lump-sum benefit 
payment’’ for an explanation. 
Match. The existing regulations describe their treatment of what 
constitutes a match between a payment 
record and a debt record. This treatment 
could differ depending on the type of 
offset being conducted. For example, 
current section 285.1, which governs the 
offset of Federal nontax payments for 
the collection of past-due support, 
requires that the TIN of a payment 
record be the ‘‘same’’ as the TIN of a 
debt record. Current section 285.5, 
which governs offset of Federal 
payments to collect Federal nontax 
debts, implies that a derivative of the 
TIN can be used to determine whether 
the TIN on the payment and debt 
records are the ‘‘same.’’ The proposed 
definition defines the term ‘‘match’’ for 
offset purposes in a manner that restores 
statutory flexibility for disbursing 
officials in determining when the 
person entitled to payment on a 
payment record is the same person as 
the debtor on a debt record. The 
proposed definition would allow 
disbursing officials to determine 
whether there is a match by using 
information derived from the payment and debt records, which would not 
necessarily require an exact match on the name or TIN. The relevant statutory 
provisions do not require that the name 
(or name control) and TIN be exact 
matches on the debt record and the 
payment record. A person entitled to 
payment and the debtor may be the 
same person in circumstances where the 
name and TIN are not exact matches (for 
example, because either the debt record 
or payment record contains a 
transcription or other human input 
error). This definition would allow (but 
not require) disbursing officials to use 
an algorithm to correct for such errors 
on names and TINs in a manner that 
results in more accurate matches. It 
would also allow disbursing officials to 
use information (other than the name 
and TIN) from the payment and debt 
records to determine whether the payee 
and debtor are the same person. This 
more flexible definition of ‘‘match’’ will 
enable disbursing officials to more 
closely comply with their requirements 
under the offset statutes. 
Means-tested program. This term’s 
definition is embedded into the text of 
current sections 285.1(k) and 
285.5(e)(7)(i), rather than in the 
definition sections for sections 285.1 
and 285.5. The proposed definition is 
added for clarity. 
Monthly benefit payment. This term is 
not defined in the existing TOP 
regulations. The proposed definition for 
‘‘monthly benefit payment’’ is 
consistent with the term ‘‘monthly 
covered benefit payment,’’ as used in 
the existing TOP regulations. 
OASDI overpayment. The proposed 
definition is consistent with the existing 
TOP regulations. 
Offset. The proposed definition is consistent with the existing TOP 
regulations but uses the more precise 
term of ‘‘PEP’’ rather than ‘‘payee.’’ 
Participating SRP State. This term is 
not defined in the existing TOP 
regulations. It is consistent with the 
term ‘‘participating State,’’ as used in 
the existing TOP regulations. 
Past-due support. The proposed 
definition expands the definition to 
include debts owed to Tribal IV–D 
agencies, to implement the new 
authority to collect child support debts 
from the Supporting America’s Children 
and Families Act, codified in relevant 
part at 26 U.S.C. 6402(c), and is 
otherwise consistent with existing TOP 
regulations. 
Payee. The proposed definition clarifies the difference between the 
terms ‘‘payee’’ and ‘‘person entitled to 
payment’’ or ‘‘PEP.’’ While the payee 
and the PEP are generally the same 
person, there may be some 
circumstances where they are different 
people. For example, a nursing home 
might serve as the representative payee 
for a beneficiary that is entitled to 
benefit payments. Or, an attorney 
representing an individual who has a 
claim against the United States might 
receive payment to her attorney trust 
account as a payee, while her client is 
the ‘‘person entitled to payment.’’

making payments in the context of 
offsets under reciprocal agreements. It is 
intended to broadly cover agencies 
making payments, whether such 
agencies disburse payments on their 
own or through another agency. In the 
context of Federal payments, the 
function of the payment agency and the 
disbursing official are often, though not 
always, segregated. The payment 
agency, through a certifying officer, is 
generally responsible for determining 
that the payment is permitted by law, 
that funds have been appropriated for 
the payment, that the name, address, 
and dollar amount are correct, whether 
the payment is subject to offset, and that 
the payment is not a duplicate payment. 
The disbursing official, on the other 
hand, disburses payments properly 
certified by a payment agency’s 
certifying officer and/or withholds all or 
part of the payment to satisfy a 
delinquent debt. 
Payment record. The proposed 
definition incorporates the definition for 
this term in the existing TOP regulations 
and adds a sentence that covers States 
making payments in the context of 
offsets under reciprocal agreements. 
PEP or person entitled to payment. This term is not used or defined in the 
existing TOP regulations; the existing 
regulations use the phrase ‘‘person 
entitled to receive the benefit of all or 
part of the payment.’’ The proposed 
definition was added to distinguish 
between the terms ‘‘payee’’ and ‘‘person 
entitled to payment.’’ 
Person. The proposed definition is consistent with the existing TOP 
regulations.

Secretary. The proposed definition is consistent with the existing TOP 
regulations. 
Separate guidance. This term is not 
used or defined in the existing TOP 
regulations. Fiscal Service may issue 
more detailed guidance on certain 
aspects of this rule. Such guidance may 
include instructions to agencies on how 
to comply with the rules set forth in the 
proposed rule (e.g., how to submit a debt to the TOP system) or specify how 
Fiscal Service or an agency may exercise 
discretion within the bounds permitted 
by the proposed rule (e.g., the dollar threshold for referrals of debt to TOP, 
which may be changed based on costs 
of collection; or time periods on agency 
action, which may be changed based on 
operational capabilities). 
State. The proposed definition is consistent with the existing TOP 
regulations. 
State debt. The proposed definition is 
consistent with the existing TOP 
regulations, except that it excludes 
debts owed by Federally recognized 
Tribes. With regard to the State 
Reciprocal Program, Fiscal Service 
determined that certain debts should be 
excluded from collection through 
Federal payment offset. In the existing 
TOP regulations, debts that are excluded 
from the definition of ‘‘State debt’’ 
include debts owed to a State by the 
United States, a foreign sovereign, 
another State, or local governments 
within a State. The rationale for these 
exclusions is that TOP is not an 
appropriate tool for resolving issues of 
indebtedness between a State and local 
government, a State and a State, or a 
State and a foreign government. This 
rationale applies equally to issues of 
indebtedness between States and 
Federally recognized Tribes. Federally 
recognized Tribes possess certain 
inherent rights of self-government. As a 
result of this Tribal sovereignty, these 
Tribes have a special relationship with 
the United States. The proposed 
definition would codify the current 
operational practice to exclude debts 
owed by Federally recognized Tribes 
from the types of debts that a State may 
collect under a reciprocal agreement. 
This rule would not change or affect any 
other rights or remedies States may have 
to collect debts owed to them by 
Federally recognized Tribes outside of 
TOP. While States may not collect debts 
owed to them by Federally recognized 
Tribes through TOP, Federal agencies 
may collect debts owed by Federally 
recognized Tribes through TOP. 
State income tax obligation. The 
proposed definition is consistent with 
the definition used in the existing TOP 
regulations. 
State payment. This term is used but

Tax refund offset. The proposed

TOP regulations. 
Tax refund payment. The proposed

Taxpayer identifying number or TIN. The proposed definition is consistent 
with the existing TOP regulations. For 
individuals, the TIN is generally (but 
not always) the individual’s social 
security number. TINs also include 
employer identification numbers and 
individual taxpayer identification 
numbers issued by the IRS. 
Treasury Offset Program or TOP. This term is used but not defined in the 
existing TOP regulations. The proposed 
definition is added for clarity. 
Tribal IV–D agency. This term is not 
used or defined in the existing TOP 
regulations. It is added to implement the 
new authority to collect child support 
debts from the Supporting America’s 
Children and Families Act, codified in 
relevant part at 26 U.S.C. 6402(c). The 
term refers to Indian Tribes and Tribal 
organizations that receive funding under 
section 455(f) of Title IV, Part D, of the 
Social Security Act. 
Unemployment compensation debt. 
The proposed definition is consistent 
with the existing TOP regulations. 
Section 285.2—General Provisions 
The existing TOP regulations repeat 
certain general rules for each type of 
offset, at times using slightly different 
language to describe the same 
requirements. This proposed section 
would consolidate general offset rules 
into a single section that would apply to 
all types of offset under TOP. This will 
improve consistency and clarity and 
avoid unnecessary repetition. To the 
extent specific rules are required for a 
specific type of offset, those rules will 
be spelled out in a separate section for 
each type of offset. 
(a) Scope. Proposed paragraph (a) describes the scope of this subpart, 
which governs the centralized offset of 
Federal payments and State payments to 
collect delinquent debts owed to the 
United States or a State. This subpart 
does not apply to administrative offsets 
that occur outside of TOP (known as 
‘‘non-centralized offsets’’). Non- 
centralized offsets are governed by other 
law, including but not limited to 
common law, the Federal Claims 
Collection Standards (see 31 CFR 901.3(c)), and agency-specific 
regulations. Laws governing 
garnishments and levies do not apply to 
offsets under this subpart. Offsets are 
not garnishments or levies. An offset 
occurs when the United States or a State 
withholds money owed to a person to

person to the United States or a State. 
Garnishment is a process whereby a 
creditor attaches wages or other 
property belonging to a debtor which is 
in the possession of a third party (for 
example, see 31 U.S.C. 3720D). A levy is the means by which the Internal 
Revenue Service or other tax collecting 
authority seizes the delinquent 
taxpayer’s property. See 26 U.S.C. 6331. This subpart applies only to Federal 
payments and State payments (as those 
terms are defined) made to or on behalf 
of a PEP. See the definitions for ‘‘PEP’’ 
and ‘‘payee.’’ It generally does not apply 
to downstream PEPs and payees. For 
example, in the context of purchases 
made by Federal agencies using a 
government credit card, the vendor is 
paid by the financial institution that 
issues the credit card, and the United 
States pays the financial institution. 
Absent an agreement between the 
financial institution and the United 
States requiring the payment from the 
financial institution to be offset for 
debts owed by the vendor, the payment 
by the financial institution to the vendor 
is not subject to offset under this 
subpart. On the other hand, the payment 
from the United States to the financial 
institution is subject to offset for debts 
owed by the financial institution. When 
determining whether to use a 
government purchase card, agencies 
must determine whether the use of the 
purchase card is an appropriate 
payment mechanism. See proposed section 285.2(e)(2)(iii). 
Lastly, the pursuit or receipt of 
collections pursuant to this subpart does 
not preclude a creditor agency from 
pursuing all other available debt 
collection remedies simultaneously. 
(b) General rules for Federal agencies. Proposed paragraph (b) is consistent 
with the existing TOP regulations. 
Proposed paragraph (b)(1)(iii) clarifies 
that agencies must complete the 60-day 
notification process prior to the debt 
becoming 121 days delinquent, so that 
the agency can complete the due 
process prerequisites and refer the debt 
to TOP by the statutory deadline. 
(c) General rule for States and Tribal IV–D agencies. Proposed paragraph (c) 
is consistent with the existing TOP 
regulations. It also incorporates Tribal 
IV–D agencies to implement the new 
authority in the Supporting America’s 
Children and Families Act. 
(d) Requirements for all creditor agencies. Proposed paragraph (d) is generally consistent with the existing 
TOP regulations. However, notable 
clarifications and/or changes are as 
follows: 
€Proposed paragraph (d)(1)(i)(C) modifies the debt eligibility requirements to remove 
the reference to a $25 minimum threshold. 
Under both the existing TOP regulations and 
the proposed rule, Fiscal Service is permitted 
to establish a dollar threshold for referred 
debts. Fiscal Service may adjust this 
threshold as appropriate in separate 
guidance. In establishing this threshold, 
Fiscal Service may consider, among other 
things, the cost of conducting an offset. 
€Proposed paragraph (d)(1)(i)(D) explains the circumstances in which a debt is not 
eligible for referral when referral would 
interfere with a Federal agency’s ability to 
preserve its rights to collateral and when 
referral would interfere with the United 
States’ interest in enforcing antitrust laws or 
protecting its interests when it becomes 
aware of the possibility of fraud, false claim, 
or misrepresentation with regard to the debt. 
€Proposed paragraph (d)(1)(ii) sets forth the due process prerequisites with which the 
creditor agency must comply. As required by 
statute, these due process prerequisites 
include the requirement to provide the 
debtor with the opportunity to review the 
creditor agency’s determination regarding the 
debt. 
€Proposed paragraph (d)(3) describes the facts to which creditor agencies must certify 
upon referral of a debt to TOP. Creditor 
agencies can (and generally do) provide the 
written certification electronically. 
€Proposed paragraph (d)(4) adds language that more explicitly addresses creditor 
agencies’ obligations to correct and update 
data on debts subject to collection in TOP. 
This obligation is provided for under the 
existing TOP regulations, but the added 
language will remind agencies of the 
importance of maintaining accurate and up- 
to-date information. This will reduce the risk 
of improper collections and will assist Fiscal 
Service in delivering offset notices to the 
correct addresses. This paragraph makes 
clear that creditor agencies may make 
updates to increase the debt balance when 
they have complied with other prerequisites; 
this, however, does not permit creditor 
agencies to aggregate more than one debt into 
a single debt record, unless otherwise 
permitted by Fiscal Service. 
(e) Federal payments. Proposed paragraph (e) is generally consistent 
with the existing TOP regulations. 
However, notable clarifications and/or 
changes are as follows: 
€Proposed paragraph (e)(2)(i) explicitly addresses the requirement to identify the PEP 
or PEPs, as is current operational practice. 
The existing TOP regulations reflect this 
requirement, but do not distinguish between 
‘‘payee’’ and ‘‘PEP.’’ When paying more than 
one PEP, the proposed paragraph also 
requires payment agencies to determine 
whether the payment is owed jointly to the 
PEPs or if it must be allocated among the 
PEPs. These requirements help ensure that 
payments are matched for PEPs, rather than 
payees who might not be PEPs. This 
paragraph also permits agencies to make a 
payment to a person other than the PEP if the 
payment agency determined that the PEP 
does not owe a debt. 
€Proposed paragraph (e)(2)(iii) addresses the mechanisms through which payment may 
be made. Each year, the Federal government 
disburses billions of payments. Most of these 
payments are automatically matched against 
the TOP database during the disbursement 
process. A small portion of these payments 
are disbursed in a manner that, due to 
current operational restraints, do not allow 
the payment to be automatically matched 
with debts in TOP. The proposed rule 
explicitly addresses the requirement that 
payment agencies work with Fiscal Service to 
identify and employ alternative processes to 
avoid missed offset collections when 
payment mechanisms do not allow for 
automated matching in TOP. 
For example, payments for purchases made 
using a government credit card are not 
automatically matched against the TOP 
database because, in such a scenario, the 
PEP, i.e., the vendor, is actually being paid by the financial institution issuing the credit 
card, and not a Federal agency. Similarly, 
payments made by class administrators who 
are responsible for disbursing payments to 
PEPs do not automatically match against 
TOP. 
Before using a payment mechanism that 
does not allow for automated matching in 
TOP, a Federal agency should determine 
whether a PEP owes a delinquent debt that 
has been referred to TOP. Fiscal Service can 
assist agencies with making this 
determination. If no such debt is owed, then 
this provision would not preclude the 
Federal agency from proceeding with making 
the payment through that mechanism. 
However, if such a debt is owed, then the 
payment agency must make the payment in 
a manner that will permit the payment to be 
offset. 
(f) Procedures for centralized offset. Proposed paragraph (f) is generally 
consistent with the existing TOP 
regulations. However, notable 
clarifications and/or changes are as 
follows: 
€Proposed paragraph (f)(1) describes the requirement for a disbursing official to take 
an offset. There must be a match between the 
debtor (from the debt record) and the PEP 
(from the payment record). See the definition 
for ‘‘match.’’ For operational reasons, this 
match may take place several days before the 
date of the offset. For example, some 
payment agencies submit batch payment 
records to Fiscal Service. To properly process 
these records, Fiscal Service may need to 
receive those batch records and conduct the 
matching process prior to the date on which 
the payment will be disbursed in accordance 
with the payment agency’s instructions. 
€Proposed paragraphs (f)(2) and (4) describe related, but different concepts. 
Paragraph (f)(2) describes circumstances 
where the PEP directs delivery of the 
payment to a different person but does not 
assign the legal ownership of the payment to 
that person. For example, a nursing home 
might serve as the representative payee for an 
elderly person who is entitled to social 
security benefit payments. In this case, the 
elderly person did not assign her legal 
ownership of the benefit payments to her

be paid to the nursing home and 
administered by the nursing home for her 
benefit, because she is unable to manage her 
own finances. As such, the benefit payments 
would be subject to offset for debts owed by 
the elderly person, but not for debts owed by 
the nursing home. 
€Proposed paragraph (f)(4) describes assigned payments. The proposed paragraph 
is intended to simplify and clarify how TOP 
treats assigned payments. 
ÆA request by a PEP to legally transfer to a third party the right to a payment is 
typically referred to as an ‘‘assignment.’’ To 
be valid as to the United States, the 
‘‘transfer’’ or ‘‘assignment’’ of a claim against 
the United States must meet the requirements 
of applicable law, including the Anti- 
Assignment Act, 31 U.S.C. 3727, and the 
laws that apply to TOP. If the requirements 
are not satisfied, the assignment is not valid 
as to the United States for purposes of this 
rule. 
ÆNothing in this proposed rule would require Fiscal Service (absent instructions 
from a payment agency), a payment agency, 
or a creditor agency to recognize an 
assignment. 
ÆIn general, assigned payments are legally subject to offset for debts of both the assignor 
(i.e., the original PEP) and the assignee (i.e., the person to whom the payment was 
assigned, also a PEP). 
ÆIn general, disbursing officials should offset the payment first for debts owed by the 
assignor and then, if anything is left, for 
debts owed by the assignee. Under current 
operations, a payment agency generally must 
issue a payment to the assignor, unless the 
payment agency confirms that the assignor 
does not owe any debts in TOP, in which 
case the payment agency may make the 
payment to the assignee (assuming the 
payment agency had authority to recognize 
the assignment). Fiscal Service provides 
specific rules to payment agencies regarding 
how to issue payments in the context of 
assigned payments in separate guidance. 
ÆA frequent scenario involving assigned payments is the award of attorneys’ fees 
under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 
where the ‘‘prevailing party’’ (i.e., the PEP) wants to assign an EAJA award to their 
attorney, 28 U.S.C. 2412. In such cases, the 
agency may recognize the assignment only if 
the prevailing party does not owe any debts 
that could be collected through offset of the 
EAJA payment. The Supreme Court 
unanimously held in Astrue v. Ratliff, 560 U.S. 586 (2010), that the EAJA term 
‘‘prevailing party’’ refers to a claimant and 
not the claimant’s attorney, and thus the 
offset of an EAJA award to collect a 
claimant’s debt to the government is proper. 
If the prevailing party does not owe any 
debts, the payment agency could recognize 
the assignment to the attorney, and the 
payment would be subject to offset for debts 
owed by the attorney (i.e., the new PEP). €Proposed paragraph (f)(3) explains that payments that are jointly owed to more than 
one PEP (such as a joint tax refund payment) 
are subject to offset for the debts owed by any 
PEP. 
€Proposed paragraph (f)(5), among other things, more clearly addresses the amount to 
be offset when a payment being disbursed is 
subject to partial exemption and the payment 
has been subject to an internal offset prior to 
payment certification and submission of the 
payment instructions to the disbursing 
official. For example, payment agencies 
might conduct their own internal offset prior 
to certifying the payment to Fiscal Service for 
offset, but Fiscal Service may lack knowledge 
of whether an internal offset has occurred 
prior to payment certification or, if so, how 
much of the payment was offset. Because 
Fiscal Service has decided, as a policy 
matter, that it would like to have the 
flexibility to calculate the percentage that 
may be offset of a partially exempt payment 
by accounting for prior offsets when it knows 
that a prior offset has taken place, Fiscal 
Service has determined that a disbursing 
official may either: (1) not offset the payment 
if the disbursing official knows that the 
payment agency has already taken an offset 
from the payment, or (2) if the disbursing 
official has sufficient information about the 
prior offset, calculate the additional amount 
by which the payment may be offset. 
Additionally, Fiscal Service would have the 
flexibility to disregard any prior offset 
conducted by the payment agency. For 
example, if Fiscal Service is disbursing a 
covered benefit payment certified by the 
Social Security Administration (SSA), and it 
knows that SSA already offset the payment, 
but does not know by how much the 
payment was offset, the Fiscal Service 
disbursing official could bypass offset for that 
payment; alternatively, if SSA informed 
Fiscal Service that the payment that it is 
certifying for disbursement for $1,950 was 
originally $2,000 (i.e., it took a $50 internal offset), Fiscal Service could take another 
$250 (because $250 + $50 is 15% of the 
original payment amount). However, the 
disbursing official may also choose to 
disregard any prior offset when calculating 
the appropriate offset amount. For example, 
if the original payment amount was $2,000, 
but SSA certified a payment in the amount 
of $1,950, the Fiscal Service disbursing 
official could offset $292.50 (i.e., 15% of $1,950). Fiscal Service also notes that, when 
calculating the offset amount, the disbursing 
official must disregard any prior levy on that 
payment. For example, if a covered benefit 
payment, certified in the amount of $2,000, 
was levied by 15% for a Federal tax debt 
through TOP, a disbursing official must offset 
that payment by another 15% for a nontax 
debt in TOP. In such a scenario, after levy 
and offset, the payment amount that would 
be disbursed to the payee would be $1,400 
(with $300 going to the IRS and another $300 
going to the other agency). The proposed 
paragraph is consistent with the last 
paragraph in 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(3)(A)(ii). 
€Proposed paragraph (f)(6) describes the priority scheme for how a payment must be 
applied when the person entitled to the 
payment owes multiple debts. While this 
subpart does not apply to the way in which 
Fiscal Service levies payments for the 
purpose of collecting Federal tax debts, the 
proposed paragraph acknowledges that such 
levies take priority over the collection of 
debts through offset under this subpart. 
Within each category, Fiscal Service will 
generally give priority to older debts first. In 
some circumstances, for operational reasons, 
Fiscal Service may alter this intra-category 
priority. For example, if a Federal agency 
refers to TOP a Federal nontax debt, and 
Fiscal Service starts collecting that debt 
through salary offset, Fiscal Service may 
continue collecting that debt through salary 
offset, even if another Federal agency later 
refers an older Federal nontax debt that is 
also eligible for collection through salary 
offset. 
(g) Notification of offset to debtor. Proposed paragraph (g) contains the 
following notable clarifications and/or 
changes: 
€Proposed paragraph (g) would revise the requirement in the existing TOP regulations 
that a warning notice be sent to the debtor 
prior to commencing offset of recurring 
payments, and would go beyond what is 
required by statute, which does not require 
any warning notice but does, in the case of 
periodic benefit payments, require notice be 
sent on or before the date of the offset. See 
31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(7)(B). The proposed rule 
would generally require that a disbursing 
official (or Fiscal Service on behalf of the 
disbursing official) send a warning notice to 
a debtor before commencing offset of 
monthly benefit payments. This requirement 
would not apply to any other recurring 
payments or one-time payments. The 
requirement would also not apply when it is 
administratively infeasible for the disbursing 
official (or Fiscal Service on behalf of the 
disbursing official) to send the letter, such as 
when a current address is unavailable or 
when a system glitch results in the failure of 
such letters to be sent. Fiscal Service will 
generally send warning notices before 
offsetting recurring payments, but notes that 
it is statutorily obligated to conduct offset 
and that its failure to send a notice does not 
change this obligation or impair any future 
offset taken. 
€Proposed paragraph (g) also clarifies the address to which this notice can be sent. 
ÆThe term ‘‘payee’’ is used by 31 U.S.C. 3716, but section 3716’s use of this term 
conflates the concepts of ‘‘payee’’ and ‘‘PEP’’ 
(see the proposed definitions of these terms). 
ÆConsistent with Congress’ intent to provide notification of the offset to the 
affected person, the proposed rule clarifies 
that this notice can be sent either to the 
payee or the PEP, depending on the address 
available. 
DIf the disbursing official has an address only for the payee, the disbursing official 
may send the notice to the payee, even if the 
payee is a different person than the PEP. 
DSimilarly, if the disbursing official has an address only for the PEP, the disbursing 
official may send the notice to the PEP, even 
if the PEP is a different person than the 
payee. 
DIf the disbursing official has an address for both the payee and the PEP, the 
disbursing official may determine which 
address to use, regardless of whether the 
payee and the PEP are the same person. 
Under current operational practice, which is 
subject to change, Fiscal Service generally 
sends the notice to the payee, rather than the

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS60041 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules debtor/PEP, since the address for the payee 
would be obtained from the payment record 
which generally would have been submitted 
to Fiscal Service more recently than the debt 
record. If the payment record does not 
include an address for the payee, the 
disbursing official generally will use the 
address on the debt record. Fiscal Service’s 
current operational practice generally 
assumes that the more current information is 
likely better information. However, the 
proposed rule would give Fiscal Service the 
flexibility to change its current operational 
approach. 
€Proposed paragraph (g) also makes clear that the failure of a disbursing official to send 
a notice (or the failure of a payee or PEP to 
receive such a notice) does not impair the 
validity of the offset. There may be 
circumstances where the address(es) 
provided on the payment record and the debt 
record are incorrect or outdated. In other 
circumstances, the addresses may be missing 
from those records. Such circumstances make 
it difficult, if not impossible, for the 
disbursing official to deliver a notice of 
offset. The disbursing official, however, is 
still under a statutory requirement to offset 
certain payments. Thus, the inability to send 
a notice to a valid address does not preclude 
offset. 
(h) Notification of offset to creditor and payment agencies. Proposed 
paragraph (h) is consistent with the 
existing TOP regulations. 
(i) Disposition of amounts collected. Proposed paragraph (i) is consistent 
with the existing TOP regulations. 
However, proposed paragraph (i)(2) 
addresses the status of an offset when 
the payment that was offset was made 
in error. Except as specified in 
§ 285.42(e), addressing tax refund offset 
to collect past-due support, there is no 
time limitation on when a payment 
agency may request a payment reversal. 
(j) Fees. Proposed paragraph (j) restores statutory flexibility to Fiscal 
Service’s fee-charging authority. The 
existing TOP regulations do not address 
Fiscal Service’s fee-charging authority 
consistently. Some provisions in the 
existing regulations require Fiscal 
Service to charge creditor agencies for 
the full cost for certain types of offset, 
even though the applicable statutes 
permit Fiscal Service to charge ‘‘up to’’ 
full cost. Where the statute permits 
Fiscal Service to charge up to full cost, 
the proposed rule would allow Fiscal 
Service to charge anywhere between $0 
and full cost. Statutes permitting Fiscal 
Service to charge between $0 and full 
cost include: 26 U.S.C. 6402(e) (offset of 
tax refund payments to collect State 
income tax obligations); 26 U.S.C. 
6402(f) (offset of tax refund payments to 
collect unemployment compensation 
debt); and 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(4) (offset of 
Federal nontax payments and State 
payments). Statutes that require Fiscal 
Service to charge full cost include: 42 
U.S.C. 664(b) (offset of tax refund 
payments to collect past-due support 
obligations); and 31 U.S.C. 3720A(d) 
(offset of tax refund payments to collect 
Federal nontax debts). 
(k) Social Security Numbers. Proposed paragraph (k) is consistent with the 
existing TOP regulations and addresses 
the restrictions imposed by the Social 
Security Number Fraud Prevention Act 
of 2017, Public Law 115–59. 
Section 285.30—Offset of Federal 
Nontax Payments and State Payments 
This section consolidates the rules 
that apply generally to the offset of 
Federal nontax payments and State 
payments. 
(a) Scope. Proposed paragraph (a) describes the scope of this and its 
related sections (i.e. §§ 285.30, 285.31, 285.32, 285.33, and 285.34), which 
govern offset of Federal nontax 
payments and State payments. It also 
describes that the scope of sections 
285.30 through 285.34 do not apply to 
Federal debts or Federal payments 
arising under the tariff laws of the 
United States or the Social Security Act, 
except to the extent provided under 
sections 204(f) and 1631(b)(4) of such 
Act and 31 U.S.C. 3716(c). This 
limitation is required due to the 
language of 31 U.S.C. 3701(d), which 
states that 31 U.S.C. 3711(e) and 3716– 
3719 ‘‘do not apply to a claim or debt 
under, or to an amount payable under— 
(1) the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
(26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), (2) the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), 
except to the extent provided under 
sections 204(f) and 1631(b)(4) of such 
Act and section 3716(c) of this title, or 
(3) the tariff laws of the United States.’’ 
The definition of ‘‘Federal debt’’ 
excludes debts arising under the 
Internal Revenue Code, and the 
definition or ‘‘Federal nontax payment’’ 
excludes payments arising under the 
Internal Revenue Code. The provision 
excluding Federal debts or Federal 
payments arising under the Social 
Security Act except to the extent 
provided under sections 204(f) and 
1631(b)(4) of such Act and 31 U.S.C. 
3716(c) means that, among other things, 
Federal debts and Federal payments 
arising under the Social Security Act are 
subject to TOP as long as they are 
carried out in accordance with the 
applicable requirements provided for in 
the cross-referenced statutory 
provisions. 
(b) General rule. Proposed paragraph (b) describes the payments generally 
subject to offset. 
(c) Exemptions of Federal nontax payments from centralized offset. 
Proposed paragraph (c) describes Fiscal 
Service’s authority to exempt payments 
from offset under TOP. It also lists the 
Federal payments that are exempt from 
offset under TOP. 
€Proposed paragraph (c)(1) explains how Federal payment agencies may request that a 
class of payments be exempted from offset 
under TOP. It describes Fiscal Service’s 
authority to grant and withdraw payment 
exemptions. 
€Proposed paragraph (c)(2) lists certain payment types that are exempt by statute and 
by the existing TOP regulations. It also lists 
payment types that Fiscal Service proposes to 
exempt through this proposed rule, including 
the following: 
ÆProposed paragraph (c)(2)(viii) describes the treatment of lump-sum benefit payments. 
See the proposed definition for ‘‘lump-sum 
benefit payment.’’ 
ÆProposed paragraph (c)(2)(ix) describes Fiscal Service’s authority to establish 
minimum thresholds for the referral of debt. 
This assists Fiscal Service in recognizing 
that, in certain circumstances, the costs of an 
offset warrant exemption from offset. For 
example, in some cases, a payment amount 
may be so small that the only amount that 
could be collected from the payment is the 
cost of an offset or less; offset in such a 
scenario would not be warranted. See 31 CFR 903.3(a)(3). 
ÆProposed paragraphs (c)(2)(x) and (xi) describe that payments are exempted from 
offset through TOP when they are for: (1) 
attorneys’ fees and litigation costs for class 
counsel made under prevailing party fee- 
shifting statutes to satisfy court judgments or 
settlements in actions certified as class 
actions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 23(b)(2) when the members of the 
class are not ascertainable; or (2) attorneys’ 
fees and litigation costs for class counsel and 
administrative costs for distributing 
settlements made under prevailing party fee- 
shifting statutes to satisfy settlements in 
actions certified as class actions pursuant to 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). In 
both these situations, the person legally 
entitled to a fee or cost payment is the 
prevailing party (i.e., each member of the class), not the class counsel or class 
administrator. As such, absent exemption, fee 
and cost payments awarded under these class 
actions would be allocated among the various 
class members and would be subject to offset 
for the debts of those class members, rather 
than for the debts of the class counsel or class 
administrator. 
ÆIn actions certified as class actions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
23(b)(2), offset may not be administratively 
feasible. Rule 23(b)(2) allows a person to sue 
on behalf of a class of litigants a person who 
has taken or refused to take action with 
respect to the class where injunctive or 
declaratory relief is sought as final relief. An 
incidental claim for monetary relief may also 
be included, such as where the substantive 
law under which the class is suing provides 
for attorneys’ fees to be paid to the prevailing 
party (i.e., every member of the class). However, in some situations, it would be 
impractical—and sometimes impossible—to 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:12 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\23DEP1.SGM 23DEP1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS60042 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules identify all of the persons who fall within a 
Rule 23(b)(2) class (i.e., the persons whose debts would be properly offset in the absence 
of an exemption from offset). As such, an 
exemption from offset for these situations is 
warranted. 
ÆIn actions certified as class actions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
23(b)(3), the Department of Justice has 
informed Fiscal Service that offsetting these 
payments for the debts of the class members 
risks adversely affecting the Government’s 
ability to settle these cases on the most 
favorable terms to the United States and 
interferes with its plenary authority over 
litigation. The Department of Justice further 
noted that offset would further complicate 
negotiation dynamics that are already highly 
charged and challenging. For example, the 
Department of Justice stated that class 
counsel might attempt to negotiate higher 
settlement amounts to ensure that their fees 
would not be reduced by the offsets for the 
debts of class members. Because offset of 
these types of payments runs the substantial 
risk of interfering with the Government’s 
ability to effectively represent the interests of 
the United States in litigation, exemption is 
appropriate. 
ÆProposed paragraph (c)(2)(xii) describes that payments are exempted from offset 
through TOP when offset is impractical, as 
determined by Fiscal Service in separate 
guidance. Such guidance may address, for 
example, situations in which the payment 
agency is unable to obtain a TIN for the PEP. 
Payment agencies are required to include a 
TIN on their certified payment vouchers (see 
the proposed definition for ‘‘payment record’’ 
and 31 U.S.C. 3325(d)). Disbursing officials 
are responsible for examining certified 
payment vouchers to determine whether 
such vouchers are in the proper form. 31 
U.S.C. 3325(a)(2)(A). And, TOP’s matching 
process requires TIN information to be on the 
payment record for an offset to take place. If 
a TIN is missing from a payment voucher, 
there is the potential for a missed offset. 
However, there are some circumstances 
where obtaining a TIN on a required payment 
is impossible or impractical. Some of the 
barriers to collecting and providing TINs 
include, for example: 
Dpayments to foreign persons who do not have TINs; 
Dpayments under a witness protection program, for undercover operations, or to 
informants where collection of the TIN 
information may interfere with the 
Government’s efforts to protect a person’s 
identity or otherwise have a detrimental 
effect on a law enforcement operation, 
military operation, national security, or 
emergency relief effort; and 
Dpayments made by a payment agency that does not have the legal authority to 
require a PEP to submit a TIN and in which 
the agency cannot independently obtain a 
TIN through reasonable efforts. 
ÆThere are certain statutes that explicitly exempt payments from ‘‘offset’’ or ‘‘setoff.’’ 
See, e.g., 31 U.S.C. 3701(d), 3716(c)(1)(C); 47 
U.S.C. 309(j)(8)(C)(ii). Proposed paragraph 
(c)(2)(xiii) explicitly states that such 
payments are exempt from offset under this 
subpart. Other statutes exempt the payment 
from levies, garnishments, and other legal 
process; these statutes do not affect an 
agency’s authority to conduct offsets. 
ÆProposed paragraph (c)(2)(xiv) exempts classes of payments for which the Secretary 
has granted an exemption. 
(d) Certification of amount to be offset if different than maximum allowed by 
law. Proposed paragraph (d) describes the authority of a creditor agency to 
reduce the amount by which a payment 
is offset if it determines the reduction is 
necessary given the debtor’s financial 
situation. This applies to the offset of 
State payments and Federal nontax 
payments; it does not apply to the offset 
of tax refund payments. 
Section 285.31—Offset of Covered 
Benefit Payments To Collect Federal 
Nontax Debts 
(a) Scope. Proposed paragraph (a) describes the scope of this section, 
which governs the offset of covered 
benefit payments. This section does not 
govern the offset of lump-sum benefit 
payments. See proposed § 285.30(c)(2)(viii). 
(b) General Rule. Proposed paragraph (b) states the general rule that Federal 
agencies collect their delinquent debt 
through the offset of covered benefit 
payments. 
(c) Offset amount. Proposed paragraph (c)(1) describes the limitation 
on the amount by which a monthly 
benefit payment may be offset. It 
restates the limitations that are specified 
in the existing TOP regulations. 
Proposed paragraph (c)(2) would permit, 
but not require, disbursing officials to 
aggregate the amount of Federal benefit 
payments received by a PEP within a 
12-month period (or within the prior 
month, on a prorated basis). This more 
closely aligns with 31 U.S.C. 
3716(c)(3)(A)(ii). 
Section 285.32—Offset of Federal Salary 
Payments To Collect Federal Nontax 
Debts 
(a) Scope. Proposed paragraph (a) describes the scope of this section, 
which governs salary offset. This section 
does not apply to the offset of final 
lump-sum payments of Federal salary, 
which are subject to 100% offset and are 
not subject to the additional procedures 
required for salary offset. 
(b) General Rule. Proposed paragraph (b) restates the general rule that, like 
other types of offset, Federal agencies 
must refer certain debts to TOP for 
collection through salary offset. Because 
of the additional and generally more 
costly due process requirements for 
salary offset (as compared with other 
types of offset), Fiscal Service has 
determined that salary offset only be 
required for debts over a certain 
amount, as Fiscal Service may prescribe 
in separate guidance. Creditor agencies 
would be permitted, but not required, to 
conduct salary offset for lower dollar 
debts, subject to minimums that Fiscal 
Service may establish. If a creditor 
agency has complied with all the 
prerequisites for collecting a debt 
through offset except for the 
prerequisites regarding the offset of 
salary payments, it may refer the debt to 
TOP for offset against all payments 
other than salary payments; if salary 
offset is required, the creditor agency 
must work toward completing the 
prerequisites for salary offset after such 
a referral. 
(c) Additional due process. Proposed paragraph (c) describes the requirement 
that the creditor agency make a 
reasonable attempt to provide a debtor 
with the opportunity for a hearing prior 
to attempting to collect the debt through 
salary offset. This is consistent with the 
existing TOP regulations. 
(d) Procedures for salary offset. Proposed paragraph (d) sets forth the 
procedures for salary offset. These 
procedures are consistent with the 
existing TOP regulations. 
In the existing TOP regulations, there 
is a provision regarding the 
establishment of an interagency 
consortium. The establishment and 
maintenance of this consortium is 
required by 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1). While 
Fiscal Service maintains this 
consortium, it determined that there 
was no need to address this in 
regulations. This proposed rule, 
therefore, proposes to eliminate that 
provision. While the proposed rule 
would eliminate this provision, Fiscal 
Service notes that the consortium will 
continue to exist. 
Section 285.33—Offset of Federal 
Nontax Payments To Collect Past-Due 
Support 
The introductory text clarifies that 
HHS, acting on behalf of a State, is the 
creditor agency for purposes of this 
section. 
(a) Scope. Proposed paragraph (a) describes the scope of this section, 
which governs the offset of Federal 
nontax payments to collect past-due 
support that is referred to TOP by HHS. 
It does not govern the offset of Federal 
nontax payments to collect past-due 
support that is referred to TOP directly 
by a State. 
(b) General Rule. Proposed paragraph (b) describes that disbursing officials 
will collect past-due support through 
offset of Federal nontax payments, in 
accordance with the provisions of this 
subpart.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS60043 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules For purposes of this section, there is 
no requirement that States conduct 
offset to collect Federal debts. By 
referring a debt to TOP (or to HHS for 
the purpose of referring to TOP), the 
State agrees to the terms of this 
regulation, which constitutes the 
reciprocal agreement required by 31 
U.S.C. 3716(h)(1)(B). 
(c) Due process. Proposed paragraph (c) explains that the due process 
described in proposed § 285.2(d)(1)(ii) 
must be provided, but that the notice 
described in that section need only be 
sent a minimum of 30 days prior to 
referring the debt to TOP (as opposed to 
60 days). 
(d) Coordination. Proposed paragraph (d) requires HHS and States to 
coordinate to ensure that the same debt 
is not referred to TOP twice. 
(e) Payments not subject to offset. Proposed paragraph (e) lists the types of 
Federal payments that may not be offset 
to collect past-due support under this 
section. As with offset of Federal nontax 
payments to collect other types of debt, 
payments can be partially or fully 
exempt. However, unlike the collection 
of other types of debt, covered benefit 
payments may not be offset through 
TOP to collect past-due support. Offset 
of tax refund payments for past due 
support is covered by § 285.42. 
(f) Special provisions applicable to Federal salary payments. Proposed 
paragraph (f) describes the way in 
which Federal salary payments may be 
offset to collect past-due support. It 
describes the amount by which Federal 
salary payments may be offset and the 
due process requirements. 
Section 285.34—Offset Under 
Reciprocal Agreements With States 
(a) Scope. Proposed paragraph (a) describes the scope of this section, 
which governs offsets under the State 
Reciprocal Program, which is a program 
within TOP through which certain 
Federal debts and State debts are 
collected under the terms of reciprocal 
agreements through the offset of State 
payments and Federal nontax payments. 
(b) General Rule. Proposed paragraph (b) states that Fiscal Service and 
disbursing officials and participating 
SRP States will comply with the terms 
of the applicable reciprocal agreement. 
(c) Reciprocal agreements. Proposed paragraph (c) describes what terms must 
be in a reciprocal agreement. Neither 
Fiscal Service nor a State is required to 
enter into a reciprocal agreement. 
(d) Offsetting Federal payments to collect State debt. Proposed paragraph 
(d) describes the requirement that States 
certify that their debts meet certain 
prerequisites prior to referring the debts 
to TOP. It also describes the types of 
Federal payments that are exempt from 
offset under the State Reciprocal 
Program. 
(e) Offsetting State payments to collect Federal debt. Proposed 
paragraph (e) describes the requirement 
that a creditor agency must certify its 
Federal debt for it to be collected under 
the State Reciprocal Program. 
(f) Fees. Proposed paragraph (f) describes that Fiscal Service may charge 
participating SRP States a fee for the 
cost of offsetting a Federal payment to 
collect a State debt. The amount of that 
fee may be anywhere between $0 and 
the full cost of applying the offset 
procedure. While Fiscal Service may 
charge a participating SRP State a fee, 
the participating SRP State may not 
charge Fiscal Service or the creditor 
agency a fee. 
Section 285.40—Offset of Tax Refund 
Payments To Collect Federal Nontax 
Debts, State Debts, and Debts Owed to 
Tribal IV–D Agencies 
This section consolidates the rules 
that apply generally to the offset of tax 
refund payments. 
(a) Scope. Proposed paragraph (a) describes the scope of this and its 
related sections (i.e. §§ 285.40, 285.41, 285.42, and 285.43), which govern the 
offset of tax refund payments through 
TOP. 
(b) General Rule. Proposed paragraph (b) describes the general rule that tax 
refund payments are subject to 
collection for Federal debts, for certain 
State debts, and for certain debts owed 
to Tribal IV–D agencies. 
(c) Reasonable efforts. Proposed paragraph (c) describes the requirement 
that a creditor agency must make a 
reasonable effort to collect the debt prior 
to attempting to collect the debt through 
tax refund offset. Sending a demand 
letter and complying with statutory and 
regulatory prerequisites is an example of 
making reasonable efforts to collect. 
(d) Notification of offset to the debtor. Proposed paragraph (d) describes the 
requirement to send the person or 
persons entitled to the tax refund 
payment a notice that the offset has

Section 285.41—Offset of Tax Refund 
Payments To Collect Federal Nontax 
Debts 
The introductory text clarifies the 
definition for the term ‘‘match,’’ when 
used as noun, as applied to this section. 
The definition is essentially the same as 
the definition provided in section 285.1, 
except that it requires the use of a name 
control and a TIN (or derivatives 
thereof). The definition for ‘‘match’’ in 
section 285.1, does not necessarily 
require the use of a name (or name 
control) and a TIN, though TOP does 
make use of those data points currently 
and anticipates doing so in the 
foreseeable future. The definition for 
‘‘match’’ in the introductory text of 
§ 285.41, on the other hand, does 
require the use of name control and TIN, 
though an exact match on those data 
fields is not required. See 31 U.S.C. 3720A(h)(3) (describing a ‘‘match’’ in 
the context of the offset of tax refund 
payments to collect Federal nontax 
debt). Note, the term ‘‘name control’’ is 
a term used by the IRS and generally 
refers to a sequence of characters 
derived from the name of a taxpayer. 
(a) Scope. Proposed paragraph (a) describes the scope of this section, 
which governs tax refund offset to 
collect Federal debts through TOP. 
(b) General Rule. Proposed paragraph (b) states that Federal agencies generally 
must collect Federal debts over 120 days 
delinquent by referring them to TOP for 
tax refund offset. 
(c) OASDI overpayment. Proposed paragraph (c) describes the additional 
requirements to collecting an OASDI 
overpayment through tax refund offset. 
(d) Proposed paragraph (d) recognizes 
that, unlike many other types of offset 
that permit Fiscal Service to charge 
anywhere from $0 per offset up to the 
full cost of offset (see proposed § 285.2(j)), Fiscal Service must charge 
Federal agencies for the full cost of 
applying the offset procedure in the 
context of tax refund offset to collect 
Federal nontax debts. See 31 U.S.C. 3720A(d). 
Section 285.42—Offset of Tax Refund 
Payments To Collect Past-Due Support 
(a) Scope. Proposed paragraph (a) describes the scope of this section, 
which governs tax refund offset to 
collect past-due support through TOP. 
(b) General Rule. Proposed paragraph (b) describes the circumstances under 
which HHS, a State, or a Tribal IV–D 
agency may refer past-due support to 
TOP. 
(c) Referral of past-due support to TOP. Proposed paragraph (c) explains the circumstances under which HHS 
may submit past-due support to TOP. It 
also permits States and Tribal IV–D 
agencies to refer past-due support to 
TOP, but only if authorized by HHS 
rules. 
(d) Additional due process. Proposed paragraph (d) describes the additional 
due process requirements for past-due 
support that is being enforced by more 
than one State or Tribal IV–D agency. 
(e) Time limitation on reversals. Proposed paragraph (e) addresses the

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS60044 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules time limitation imposed on IRS for 
reversing an improper tax refund 
payment. This time limitation was 
imposed on December 30, 2015, through 
an interim final rule (80 FR 81463). The 
comments received pursuant to that 
interim final rule will be addressed 
along with comments to this proposed 
rule. 
(f) Fees. Proposed paragraph (f) recognizes that, unlike many other types 
of offset that permit Fiscal Service to 
charge anywhere from $0 per offset up 
to the full cost of offset (see proposed § 285.2(j)), Fiscal Service must charge 
States and Tribal IV–D agencies for the 
full cost of applying the offset procedure 
in the context of tax refund offset to 
collect past-due support. See 42 U.S.C. 664(b). If the full cost of an offset 
exceeds the statutory maximum 
(currently $25), Fiscal Service will 
charge the statutory maximum. 
Section 285.43—Offset of Tax Refund 
Payments To Collect State Income Tax 
and Unemployment Compensation 
Debts 
There are no additional definitions 
unique to this section. 
(a) Scope. Proposed paragraph (a) describes the scope of this section, 
which governs tax refund offset to 
collect State income tax obligations and 
unemployment compensation debts. 
(b) General Rules. Proposed paragraph (b) states that States may (but are not 
required to) refer to TOP State income 
tax obligations and unemployment 
compensation debts. If States refer such 
debts, Fiscal Service will collect those 
debts through offset, subject to the 
provisions of the proposed rule. 
(c) Additional due process. Proposed paragraph (c) explains the due process 
requirements (beyond those required 
under the proposed § 285.2(d)(1)(ii)) for 
collecting State income tax obligations 
and unemployment compensation debts 
through tax refund offset. 
Fiscal Service invites commenters’ 
views on all aspects of the proposed 
rule, including whether the proposed 
rule is appropriately tailored and clear. 
III. Procedural Analyses 
Federalism 
This proposed rule has been reviewed 
under Executive Order 13132, 
Federalism. This proposed rule would 
not have substantial direct effects on 
States, on the relationship between the 
national government and the States, or 
on distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. Therefore, in 
accordance with Executive Order 13132, 
it is determined that this proposed rule 
does not have sufficient federalism 
implications to warrant the preparation 
of a federalism summary impact 
statement. 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
The Paperwork Reduction Act does 
not apply because this proposed rule 
would not impose information 
collection requirements that require the 
approval of the Office of Management 
and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et 
seq. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), it is hereby 
certified that the proposed rule would 
not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities 
because this rule only impacts persons 
who receive payments from Federal 
agencies or States and who are 
delinquent on debts owed to Federal 
agencies, States, or Tribal IV–D 
agencies. Accordingly, an initial 
regulatory flexibility analysis under the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act is not 
required. Fiscal Service seeks comment 
on whether the certification made 
herein should be reconsidered and, if 
so, on what basis. 
Regulatory Planning and Review 
This proposed rule is not a significant 
rule for purposes of Executive Order 
12866 and has not been reviewed by the 
Office of Management and Budget. This 
rule is anticipated to be designated a 
deregulatory action for purposes of 
Executive Order 14192. 
Unfunded Mandates Act of 1995 
Section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 
1532 (Unfunded Mandates Act), 
requires that the agency prepare a 
budgetary impact statement before 
promulgating any rule likely to result in 
a Federal mandate that may result in the 
expenditure by State, local, and Tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector, of $100 million or more 
in any one year. If a budgetary impact 
statement is required, section 205 of the 
Unfunded Mandates Act also requires 
the agency to identify and consider a 
reasonable number of regulatory 
alternatives before promulgating the 
rule. We have determined that this rule 
would not result in expenditures by 
State, local, and Tribal governments, or 
by the private sector, of $100 million or 
more in any one year. Accordingly, we 
have not prepared a budgetary impact 
statement or specifically addressed any 
regulatory alternatives.

‘‘address’’ is limited to a physical street 
address or post office box. 
Centralized offset means offset 
conducted through TOP. 
Covered benefit payment means a 
Federal payment payable to an 
individual under the Social Security Act

Board determines to be tier 2 benefits). 
Creditor agency means any Federal 
agency that is owed a debt that seeks to 
collect that debt through offset of 
Federal or State payments. For purposes 
of §§ 285.2, 285.30, 285.33, 285.34, 
285.40, 285.42, and 285.43, the term 
‘‘creditor agency’’ also includes any 
State that is owed a debt that seeks to

payments. For purpose of § 285.42, the 
term ‘‘creditor agency’’ also includes 
Tribal IV–D agencies. 
Days delinquent refers to the number 
of days that a debt has been in a 
delinquent status. For administrative 
debts (e.g., debts arising from fines, penalties, and overpayments), the first 
day of delinquency generally is the date 
of the creditor agency’s initial written 
demand for payment. For debts that 
arise from the extension of credit 
through direct loans, loan guarantees, or 
insurance, the date of delinquency 
generally is the due date specified in the 
applicable agreement or instrument.

Tribal IV–D agency. For purposes of 
§§ 285.31, 285.32, and 285.41, the term

a debt in TOP, including, but not 
limited to, the amount of the debt and 
the debtor’s name, address, and 
taxpayer identifying number. 
Debtor means a person who owes a debt. 
Delinquent or past-due refers to the status of a debt and means a debt has 
not been paid by the date specified in 
the creditor agency’s initial written 
demand for payment or applicable 
agreement or instrument, unless other 
payment arrangements satisfactory to 
the creditor agency have been made and 
such payment arrangements cure the 
delinquency. 
Disbursing official, in the context of 
the offset of a Federal payment, means 
an official who has authority to disburse 
money pursuant to Title 31, Subtitle III, 
Chapter 33, Subchapter II of the United 
States Code or another Federal law and, 
in the context of the offset of a State 
payment, means the participating SRP 
State. 
Disposable pay means that part of 
current basic pay, special pay, incentive 
pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or in the

pay, other authorized pay remaining 
after the deduction of any amount 
required by law to be withheld (other 
than deductions to execute garnishment 
orders in accordance with parts 581 and 
582 of this chapter). Among the legally

pay are levies pursuant to the Internal 
Revenue Code (title 26, United States 
Code) and deductions described in 
§ 581.105(b) through (f) of this chapter.

3701(b)(1), except that it excludes debts 
arising under the Internal Revenue 
Code. The term ‘‘Federal debt’’ includes

characteristic of a debt and means there 
has been a final agency determination 
that the debt, in the amount stated, is 
due, and there are no legal bars to 
collection by offset. A debt would not be 
legally enforceable, for example, if the 
debt is: 
(1) Subject to the automatic stay in 
bankruptcy proceedings; 
(2) The subject of a pending 
administrative review required by a 
statute or regulation that prohibits 
collection action during the review 
process; or 
(3) Governed by a statute that 
precludes collection through offset. 
Lump-sum benefit payment is a 
covered benefit payment and refers to a 
one-time payment made in lieu of 
recurring payments (or a portion of such 
payments) that would otherwise be paid 
over a period of time. 
Lump-sum benefit payment floor is 
calculated, in Fiscal Service’s discretion 
and depending on the information 
available, as one of the following: 
(1) $9,000; 
(2) $750 times the number of months 
to which the lump-sum benefit payment 
relates; 
(3) $750 times the number of months 
to which the lump-sum benefit payment 
relates minus any other amounts the 
PEP received as Federal benefit 
payments during those months; or 
(4) $9,000 minus any other amounts 
the PEP received as Federal benefit 
payments within a 12-month period. 
Match, when used as a noun, means that the person entitled to payment on 
a payment record is the same person as 
the debtor on a debt record, as 
determined by Fiscal Service using 
information derived from the payment 
record and the debt record. When used

conduct the process that results in a 
match.

payment payable on a recurring basis at 
monthly intervals.

including but not limited to amounts a 
State is enforcing pursuant to a 
cooperative agreement with an Indian 
Tribe or Tribal organization that 
receives funding under section 455(f) of 
the Social Security Act. For purposes of 
§ 285.42, past-due support also means 
the amount of a delinquency, 
determined under a court order or an 
order of an administrative procedure 
established under Tribal law, for 
support and maintenance of a child, or 
of a child and the parent with whom the 
child is living, which has not been paid.

§ 285.2 General provisions. 
(a) Scope. (1) This subpart governs the centralized offset of Federal payments 
and State payments to collect 
delinquent debts owed to the United 
States, a State, or a Tribal IV–D agency 
in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 
3720A, 5 U.S.C. 5514, 26 U.S.C. 6402, 
and 42 U.S.C. 664. 
(2) This section sets forth the general 
rules applicable to centralized offset. 
Specific rules for each type of offset are 
set forth in §§ 285.30 through 285.34 
and 285.40 through 285.43. To the 
extent there is a conflict between the 
general rules and the specific rules, the 
specific rules apply. 
(3) The receipt of collections pursuant 
to this subpart does not preclude a 
creditor agency from pursuing other 
debt collection remedies in conjunction 
with centralized offset. 
(b) General rules for Federal agencies—(1) Mandatory referral of delinquent debts. Federal agencies must 
refer debts to TOP for offset against all 
payment types subject to offset through 
TOP in accordance with this subpart. 
(i) The requirement in this paragraph 
(b)(1) applies to any debt over 120 days 
delinquent, other than debts owed by 
foreign sovereigns or debts that fail to 
meet the requirements of paragraph 
(d)(1)(i) of this section. 
(ii) If a debt that is over 120 days 
delinquent is not legally enforceable 
solely because it is under review as 
described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of 
this section, the Federal agency must 
refer the debt to TOP within 30 days 
after completing its review. 
(iii) Federal agencies must send the 
60-day notice required in section 
(d)(1)(ii) at least 60 days prior to the 
debt becoming 121 days delinquent. 
(2) Discretionary referral of delinquent debts. Federal agencies may 
refer to TOP a debt that is owed by a 
foreign sovereign or is less than 121 
days delinquent. 
(3) Federal agency regulations. Before referring a debt to TOP, Federal agencies 
must prescribe regulations in 
accordance with the requirements of 31 
U.S.C. 3716(b) and 31 U.S.C. 3720A(a). 
Before referring debts to TOP for salary 
offset, Federal agencies must also 
prescribe regulations pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 5514(b) and 5 CFR 550.1104. 
(c) General rule for States and Tribal IV–D agencies. States and Tribal IV–D 
agencies may refer delinquent debts to 
TOP in accordance with this subpart. 
(d) Requirements for all creditor agencies—(1) Referral prerequisites. (i) A debt referred to TOP must be: 
(A) Past-due in the amount stated by 
the creditor agency; 
(B) Legally enforceable; 
(C) More than the dollar threshold 
established by Fiscal Service in separate 
guidance; and 
(D) To the extent it is a Federal debt: 
(1) Not secured by collateral subject to 
a pending foreclosure action, unless the 
creditor agency determines that offset 
will not adversely affect the creditor 
agency’s rights to the secured collateral 
or the creditor agency has determined it 
may relinquish rights to such collateral; 
(2) Not based in whole or in part on 
conduct in violation of the antitrust 
laws; and 
(3) Not appearing to arise from or 
involve fraud, a false claim, or a 
misrepresentation, except to the extent 
permitted by the Department of Justice 
or if the provisions of 31 CFR 900.3 do 
not apply.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS60048 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules (ii) The creditor agency must have 
made a reasonable attempt to provide 
each debtor with: 
(A) Written notification, at least 60 
days before referring the debt to TOP, to 
the debtor’s address last known to the 
creditor agency, identifying: 
(1) The nature and the amount of the 
debt; 
(2) The intention of the creditor 
agency to collect the debt through the 
offset of Federal and State payments; 
and 
(3) The debtor’s rights and how the 
debtor may exercise those rights; 
(B) An opportunity to inspect and 
copy the records of the creditor agency 
pertaining to the debt; 
(C) An opportunity for a review 
within the creditor agency of the 
determination of indebtedness, 
including an opportunity to present 
evidence that all or part of the debt is 
not past-due or legally enforceable; and 
(D) An opportunity to enter into a 
written repayment agreement with the 
creditor agency. 
(2) Delinquent debt information requirements. For each debt referred to TOP, the creditor agency must provide 
to Fiscal Service the following: 
(i) The name and taxpayer identifying 
number of the debtor; 
(ii) The debtor’s address last known to 
the creditor agency, if known; 
(iii) The amount of the debt; 
(iv) The date on which the debt 
became delinquent; 
(v) Contact information for an 
individual or office within the creditor 
agency who will handle questions, 
concerns or communications regarding 
the debt; 
(vi) Written certification as required 
in paragraph (d)(3) of this section; and 
(vii) Any other information requested 
by Fiscal Service. 
(3) Creditor agency certification. At the time the creditor agency refers a 
debt to TOP, the creditor agency must 
provide, in the manner required by 
Fiscal Service, written certification that: 
(i) The debt meets the requirements 
described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section; 
(ii) The creditor agency has satisfied 
all the requirements described in 
paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section; 
(iii) The creditor agency has complied 
with all statutes, regulations, policies, 
and contract provisions applicable to 
the creditor agency’s assessment of 
interest, penalties, and administrative 
costs, and has provided written notice 
to each debtor explaining the creditor 
agency’s obligations to accrue and 
assess any such charges; 
(iv) The creditor agency has satisfied 
any other requirements applicable to the 
collection of the debt through offset as 
set forth in this subpart; 
(v) The creditor agency has satisfied 
such other requirements as Fiscal 
Service may impose; and 
(vi) The individual making the 
certification has the delegated authority 
to do so on behalf of the head of the 
creditor agency. 
(4) Correcting and updating debt information. (i) After a debt has been referred to TOP, the creditor agency 
must provide, at least annually, in the 
manner and timeframes required by 
Fiscal Service, written certification that 
the debt continues to be legally 
enforceable and that all the information 
in the debt record, including the amount 
of the debt, is correct. 
(ii) On an ongoing basis, the creditor 
agency must update: 
(A) The amount of the debt in the debt 
record to reflect any collections the 
creditor agency receives outside of TOP; 
(B) Address information for the 
debtor; and 
(C) Any other information on the debt 
record. 
(iii) The creditor agency may update 
debt records to reflect any increases in 
the amount of the debt referred to TOP 
so long as the creditor agency has 
complied with the requirements of 
paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section with 
regard to the increased amounts. 
Creditor agencies may not update a debt 
record to add an amount associated with 
a separate debt, unless otherwise 
permitted by Fiscal Service. 
(iv) The creditor agency must notify 
Fiscal Service immediately of any 
change in the legal enforceability of the 
debt, including notice that the debtor 
has filed for bankruptcy protection. 
(5) Duplication not required. Nothing in this subpart requires any creditor 
agency to duplicate any notice or 
opportunity for hearing or review before 
referral of the debt to TOP. 
(e) Federal payments—(1) Payments eligible for centralized offset. All 
Federal nontax payments, except as set 
forth in § 285.30(c)(2), and all tax refund 
payments, except as exempted by 
statute, are eligible for centralized offset. 
(2) Payment agency responsibilities— (i) Determination of PEP or PEPs. (A) Unless the payment agency determines 
(in a time and manner specified by 
Fiscal Service in separate guidance) that 
the PEP does not owe a debt that has 
been referred to TOP: 
(1) The payment agency must identify 
the PEP on the payment record, and 
(2) the payment agency must submit 
a separate payment voucher for each 
PEP, unless a payment is owed jointly 
to more than one PEP. 
(B) If the payment agency determines 
that the PEP does not owe a debt that 
has been referred to TOP, these 
regulations do not prohibit the payment 
agency from making the payment to a 
different person from the PEP, if 
otherwise appropriate. 
(ii) Payment vouchers. Payment agencies must prepare, submit, and 
certify payment vouchers in the manner 
prescribed by the disbursing official, 
including for the purpose of ensuring 
that all eligible payments will be subject 
to centralized offset for debts owed by 
PEPs and that all ineligible payments 
will not be subject to centralized offset. 
(iii) Payment mechanism. In general, unless a payment is exempt from offset, 
a payment agency must ensure its 
payment is disbursed through a 
payment mechanism that will 
automatically match with debts that 
have been referred to TOP. This may 
limit the circumstances in which an 
agency may use a credit card to make a 
payment. To the extent a payment 
agency disburses its payments through a 
payment mechanism that does not 
automatically match with debts that 
have been referred to TOP, or to the 
extent the payment agency makes a 
payment to a third party who 
subsequently disburses the money to the 
PEPs, the payment agency must work 
with Fiscal Service to match the 
payments through a manual process. 
(3) Payment agencies and disbursing officials have satisfied the obligation 
underlying the payment. When an offset 
occurs, the debtor has received payment 
in full for the underlying obligation 
represented by the payment. Pursuant to 
31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2)(A), neither the 
disbursing official nor the payment 
agency may be held liable for the 
amount of the offset on the basis that the 
underlying obligation was not satisfied. 
(f) Procedures for centralized offset— (1) Disbursing official requirement. When a match occurs and all other 
requirements for centralized offset have 
been met, the disbursing official will 
offset a payment to satisfy, in whole or 
part, any debt owed by the PEP. 
(2) Payments offset for debts owed by PEPs. If a payment is made to a payee that is not a PEP with respect to that 
payment and if the payment agency 
properly identifies the PEP and payee in 
the payment record, the disbursing 
official will offset that payment only to 
collect debts owed by the PEP. 
(3) Payments made jointly to more than one PEP. If more than one person 
is jointly entitled to a payment (i.e., 
there is more than one PEP for a 
payment), the entire payment will be 
subject to offset for a debt of any PEP, 
unless otherwise prohibited by law. If a

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS60049 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules tax refund payment is offset, any non- 
debtor PEP filing a joint return with a 
debtor may secure their proper share of 
a tax refund payment from which an 
offset was made by filing a Form 8379, 
Injured Spouse Allocation, or successor 
form, with the IRS. IRS will then pay 
the non-debtor PEP their share of the 
refund and request that Fiscal Service 
deduct that amount from amounts 
payable to the creditor agency. Fiscal 
Service and the creditor agency will 
adjust their debt records accordingly. A 
successful injured spouse claim does 
not mean that the initial tax refund 
payment was erroneous or otherwise not 
due to the taxpayer. 
(4) Assigned payments. Unless prohibited by Federal statute, if a person 
(an ‘‘assignor’’) assigns the right to 
receive a Federal payment to a third 
party (an ‘‘assignee’’), the assigned 
payment will be subject to centralized 
offset to collect any delinquent debt 
owed by either the assignee or the 
assignor. 
(5) Offset amount. The disbursing official will offset the lesser of: 
(i) The amount of the payment as 
shown on the payment record; 
(ii) The amount of the debt; 
(iii) The amount specified by a 
creditor agency, pursuant to § 285.30(d); 
or 
(iv) In the case of a payment that is 
partially exempted under § 285.30(c), at 
the disbursing official’s option: 
(A) The amount of the un-exempted 
portion of the payment, calculated 
based on the amount of the payment as 
shown on the payment record; 
(B) The amount specified in 
paragraph (f)(5)(iv)(A) of this section 
less any reduction taken by the payment 
agency through internal offset; or 
(C) If the amount specified in 
paragraph (f)(5)(iv)(B) of this section 
cannot be calculated, $0. 
(6) Priority of offsets. (i) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code 
takes precedence over offsets under this 
subpart. 
(ii) When a debtor owes more than 
one debt referred under this subpart, 
amounts offset will be applied: 
(A) First, to satisfy any past-due 
support; 
(B) Second, to satisfy any Federal 
debts; and 
(C) Third, to any State debts other 
than past-due support. 
(iii) To the extent a debtor owes more 
than one debt in one of the categories 
specified in paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this 
section, amounts offset will be applied 
first against older debts or as otherwise 
determined by Fiscal Service in separate 
guidance. 
(g) Notification of offset to debtor—(1) Warning Letter. Before offsetting a 
recurring payment, the disbursing 
official (or Fiscal Service on behalf of 
the disbursing official) may, but is not 
required, to notify either the payee or 
the PEP (depending on what address 
information is available) in writing of 
when offsets are expected to begin and 
any other such information that the 
disbursing official (or Fiscal Service on 
behalf of the disbursing official) deems 
appropriate. With regard to monthly 
benefit payments, when 
administratively feasible, the disbursing 
official (or Fiscal Service on behalf of 
the disbursing official) will notify either 
the payee or the PEP (depending on 
what address information is available) 
in writing of when offsets are expected 
to begin and any other such information 
that the disbursing official (or Fiscal 
Service on behalf of the disbursing 
official) deems appropriate. The 
disbursing official (or Fiscal Service on 
behalf of the disbursing official) will 
determine in its discretion whether 
sending this notice is administratively 
feasible and may consider factors such 
as whether it has an accurate address to 
which to send such a letter and whether 
systems are functioning as expected. If 
the offset of a stream of monthly benefit 
payment is suspended or reduced for 
any reason, the disbursing official (or 
Fiscal Service on behalf of the 
disbursing official) need not send any 
additional notice. Failure to send a 
warning notice will not affect the 
validity of any offset. 
(2) Post-Offset Notification Letter. When an offset occurs under this 
subpart, the disbursing official (or Fiscal 
Service on behalf of the disbursing 
official) will notify either the payee or 
the PEP (depending on what address 
information is available) in writing of 
the offset. Failure to send an offset 
notice will not affect the validity of any 
offset. The offset notice will include: 
(i) A description of the payment, the 
amount of the offset, and the date on 
which the offset occurred; 
(ii) The purpose of the offset (e.g., to satisfy past-due support, Federal debt, 
State income tax obligation, or 
unemployment compensation debt, or 
other State debt); 
(iii) The identity of the creditor 
agency requesting the offset; and 
(iv) Contact information for an 
individual or office within the creditor 
agency who will handle concerns 
regarding the offset. 
(h) Notification of offset to creditor and payment agencies—(1) Notification to creditor agencies. Fiscal Service will 
notify the creditor agency of all offsets 
made to collect the creditor agency’s 
debts. This notification will include 
identifying information for each debtor, 
the total amounts collected from each 
debtor’s payment with regard to the 
creditor agency’s debts, and the amount 
of any fees charged to the creditor 
agency by Fiscal Service and any other 
disbursing official conducting offsets. 
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) 
of this section or in separate guidance, 
Fiscal Service and other disbursing 
officials generally will not advise the 
creditor agency of the source of payment 
from which the offset amounts were 
collected. 
(2) Notification to HHS. Upon request from HHS, Fiscal Service and other 
disbursing officials will share with HHS 
information contained in the payment 
records of persons who owe past-due 
support if that information would assist 
in the collection of such debts. 
(3) Notification to Fiscal Service. When a non-Treasury disbursing official 
conducts an offset, that disbursing 
official will transmit to Fiscal Service 
all of the information necessary for 
Fiscal Service to send the notification 
under paragraphs (g) and (h) of this 
section, including the amount of any 
fees that the creditor agency is 
responsible for paying. 
(4) Notification to payment agencies. Fiscal Service will make available to the 
payment agency the information 
contained in the offset notice so the 
payment agency may direct any 
questions about the offset to the 
appropriate contact point in the creditor 
agency. 
(i) Disposition of amounts collected— (1) Transmission of amounts collected. Fiscal Service will transmit amounts 
collected through centralized offset, less 
fees charged pursuant to paragraph (j) of 
this section, to the appropriate creditor 
agency or agencies. Alternatively, Fiscal 
Service may transmit all amounts 
collected through centralized offset and 
then separately bill the creditor agency 
or agencies for any fees charged 
pursuant to paragraph (j) of this section. 
(2) Payment errors. If a payment agency discovers that a payment that 
was offset (either in whole or in part) 
should not have been made and 
determines that the payment should be 
reversed, the payment agency must 
promptly reverse the amount of the 
payment that is available for reversal. 
Fiscal Service will notify the creditor 
agency of the reversal and, in Fiscal 
Service’s discretion, will either: 
(i) Deduct the portion of the reversed 
payment that was offset from future 
amounts payable to the creditor agency; 
or 
(ii) Require the creditor agency to 
return promptly to the disbursing 
official an amount equal to the portion 
of the reversed payment that was offset.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS60050 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules (3) Refunds. In the event that a refund of an offset is appropriate, the 
disbursing official is generally not 
responsible for refunding the amount of 
the offset. The creditor agency must 
make any appropriate refunds and must 
notify Fiscal Service if it refunds all or 
any part of an offset taken through TOP. 
(4) Records. If any payment (or portion thereof) that was offset is 
reversed or if any amount of an offset is 
refunded, Fiscal Service and the 
creditor agency will adjust their records 
accordingly. 
(j) Fees. Unless otherwise provided by statute, Fiscal Service may charge 
creditor agencies fees sufficient to cover 
up to the full cost of implementing the 
offset procedures described in this 
subpart. 
(k) Social Security numbers. Fiscal Service will ensure that an individual’s 
social security number will not be 
visible on the outside of any package it 
sends by mail. In addition, Fiscal 
Service generally will redact or partially 
redact social security numbers in 
documents it sends by mail; however, to 
administer TOP, Fiscal Service (and 
other disbursing officials) may need to 
include social security numbers in 
mailed documents, including, for 
example: 
(1) In interoffice and interagency 
communications; 
(2) In notices, including notices to the 
PEP or payee that an offset has or will 
occur, when the social security number 
is (or is embedded in) a creditor 
agency’s account number, debt 
identification number, or debtor 
identification number; 
(3) In response to a request of a debtor 
or a debtor’s representative for records 
of Fiscal Service’s offset activities; and 
(4) When required by law. 
§ 285.30 Offset of Federal nontax 
payments and State payments. 
(a) Scope. This section and §§ 285.31 through 285.34 set forth rules applicable 
to the offset of Federal nontax and State 
payments. This section and §§ 285.31 
through 285.34 do not apply to Federal 
debts or Federal payments arising 
under: 
(1) the tariff laws of the United States; 
or 
(2) the Social Security Act, except to 
the extent provided under sections 
204(f) and 1631(b)(4) of such Act and 31 
U.S.C. 3716(c). 
(b) General rule. Except as set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, all 
Federal nontax payments are eligible for 
centralized offset for the collection of 
Federal debts and, to the extent 
permitted under §§ 285.33 and 285.34, 
for State debts. State payments are 
eligible for centralized offset for the 
collection of Federal debts to the extent 
permitted under § 285.34. 
(c) Exemptions of Federal nontax payments from centralized offset—(1) 
Agency requests for exemptions. To 
request an exemption of a Federal 
nontax payment from centralized offset 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(3)(B), the 
head of a payment agency must make a 
request for an exemption in writing and 
in compliance with the procedures 
established by Fiscal Service in separate 
guidance. Fiscal Service may only 
exempt classes of payments from 
centralized offset and will not consider 
requests to exempt classes of debt from 
centralized offset. Fiscal Service may 
withdraw a previously granted 
exemption if it determines that the 
exemption is no longer warranted. 
(i) Means-tested program payments. Fiscal Service will exempt from 
centralized offset classes of payments 
made under means-tested programs 
upon the request of the payment agency. 
(ii) Payments made under programs that are not means-tested. Fiscal Service 
may exempt from centralized offset 
classes of payments that are not made 
under means-tested programs upon the 
request of the payment agency. Payment 
agencies may request that Fiscal Service 
exempt 100% or a specific lesser 
percentage or amount of each payment 
in a payment class. Fiscal Service will 
consider such requests under standards 
it prescribes in separate guidance. Such 
standards will give due consideration to 
whether offset would tend to interfere 
substantially with or defeat the purpose 
of the payment agency’s program. 
(2) Exempted payments. The following payments are exempt from 
centralized offset: 
(i) Black Lung Part C benefit 
payments; 
(ii) Railroad Retirement tier 2 
payments; 
(iii) Payments made under the tariff 
laws of the United States; 
(iv) Payments made under any 
program administered by the Secretary 
of Education under title IV of the Higher 
Education Act of 1965 for which 
payments are certified by the 
Department of Education; 
(v) Federal loan payments (other than 
travel advances); 
(vi) 75% of the amount of the 
payment as shown on the payment 
record of any payment of retirement 
annuity certified by the Office of 
Personnel Management; 
(vii) 85% of the amount of a payment 
as shown on the payment record of a 
covered benefit payment; 
(viii) In the case of a lump-sum 
benefit payment, the greater of: 
(A) the amount specified in paragraph 
(c)(2)(vii) of this section; and 
(B) the lump-sum benefit payment 
floor; 
(ix) Any payment that is below the 
threshold established by Fiscal Service 
under § 285.2(d)(1)(i)(C); 
(x) Any payment for attorneys’ fees 
and/or litigation costs for class counsel 
made under prevailing party fee-shifting 
statutes to satisfy court judgments or 
settlements in actions certified as class 
actions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 23(b)(2) when the members of 
the class are not ascertainable; 
(xi) Any payment for attorneys’ fees 
and/or litigation costs for class counsel 
and administrative costs for distributing 
settlements made under prevailing party 
fee-shifting statutes to satisfy 
settlements in actions certified as class 
actions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 23(b)(3); 
(xii) Any payment type for which 
offset is impracticable, as determined by 
Fiscal Service in separate guidance; 
(xiii) Any other payments for which 
an exemption is explicitly provided for 
by Federal statute; and 
(xiv) Any other payments for which 
an exemption has been granted in 
accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(3)(B). 
(d) Certification of amount to be offset if different than maximum allowed by 
law. If the creditor agency determines and certifies to Fiscal Service that the 
maximum amount allowed by law to be 
offset from Federal nontax payments 
would result in financial hardship to the 
debtor and that a lesser offset amount 
(specified either in dollar amount or as 
a percentage of the payment) is 
reasonable and appropriate based on the 
debtor’s financial circumstances, then 
the disbursing official will offset such 
lesser amount specified by the creditor 
agency. 
§ 285.31 Offset of covered benefit 
payments to collect Federal nontax debts. 
(a) Scope. This section sets forth special rules applicable to the offset of 
covered benefit payments, other than 
lump-sum benefit payments, to collect 
delinquent Federal debts through TOP. 
(b) General rule. To the extent required by § 285.2(b)(1), Federal 
agencies must refer delinquent debts to 
TOP for collection through the offset of 
monthly benefit payments. 
(c) Offset amount. (1) The amount offset from a monthly benefit payment 
will be the lesser of: 
(i) The amount of the debt; 
(ii) An amount equal to 15% of the 
monthly benefit payment; or 
(iii) The amount, if any, by which the 
monthly benefit payment exceeds $750. 
(2) The disbursing official may 
disregard the offset limitation specified

the PEP has received either: 
(i) An amount equal to at least $9,000 
in Federal benefit payments within the 
prior 12 months; or 
(ii) An amount equal to at least $750 
in Federal benefit payments within the 
prior month. 
§ 285.32 Offset of Federal salary payments 
to collect Federal nontax debts. 
(a) Scope. (1) This section sets forth special rules applicable to salary offset 
to collect delinquent Federal debts 
through TOP. 
(2) This section does not govern offset 
of final salary payments or lump-sum 
payments made to employees who have 
left a Federal agency’s employ. 
(b) General rule. To the extent required by § 285.2(b)(1), Federal 
agencies must refer debts to TOP for 
collection through salary offset. The 
requirement to collect debts through 
salary offset applies only with regard to 
debts over a threshold that Fiscal 
Service may establish in separate 
guidance. 
(c) Additional due process. In addition to the requirements of 
§ 285.2(d)(1)(ii), the creditor agency 
must have made a reasonable attempt to 
provide each debtor with an 
opportunity for a hearing, in accordance 
with 5 U.S.C. 5514 and agency 
regulations issued in accordance with 5 
CFR 550.1104. 
(d) Procedures for salary offset. (1) Each salary payment agency will 
compare debt records with records of 
Federal salary payments that it will 
disburse or certify to a disbursing 
official for disbursement. When a match 
occurs and all other requirements for 
salary offset have been met: 
(i) The disbursing official will offset 
the Federal employee’s salary payment 
to satisfy, in whole or part, the debt 
owed by the Federal employee; or 
(ii) The salary payment agency, on 
behalf of the disbursing official, will 
deduct the offset amount from a Federal 
employee’s disposable pay before it 
certifies the Federal employee’s salary 
payment to a disbursing official for 
disbursement. 
(2) Offset amount. (i) The amount offset from a salary payment under this 
section will be the lesser of: 
(A) The amount of the debt; 
(B) An amount equal to 15% of the 
debtor’s disposable pay. The salary 
payment agency will use such records 
as it deems necessary to accurately 
calculate the debtor’s disposable pay; or 
(C) The amount determined under 
§ 285.30(d). 
(ii) Alternatively, the amount offset 
may be an amount greater than the 
amount specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) 
of this section if agreed upon, in 
writing, by the debtor and the creditor 
agency. 
§ 285.33 Offset of Federal nontax 
payments to collect past-due support. 
As used in this section, HHS, acting 
on behalf of a State, is the creditor 
agency. 
(a) Scope. This section sets forth special rules applicable to the offset of 
Federal nontax payments to collect past- 
due support through TOP. This section 
applies only to the referral of past-due 
support by HHS. For referral of past-due 
support directly by a State that has 
entered into a reciprocal agreement with 
Fiscal Service, see § 285.34. 
(b) General rule. A disbursing official will offset any Federal nontax payment 
subject to offset under this subpart to 
collect past-due support. 
(c) Due process. Either the State to which the past-due support is owed or 
HHS must provide the due process 
specified by § 285.2(d)(1)(ii), except that 
the notice referred to in that section may 
be sent 30 days prior to referral of the 
past-due support to TOP. 
(d) Coordination. HHS and the States will coordinate to ensure that there are 
no duplicative referrals of past-due 
support to TOP. 
(e) Payments not subject to offset. The following Federal payments are not 
eligible for offset under this section: 
(1) Payments exempted from offset 
under § 285.30(c)(2); 
(2) Covered benefit payments; and 
(3) Tax refund payments. 
(f) Special provisions applicable to Federal salary payments—(1) Offset amount. (i) Unless a lower maximum offset limitation is provided by 
applicable State law, the maximum part 
of a Federal salary payment subject to 
offset to collect past-due support may 
not exceed those amounts set forth in 15 
U.S.C. 1673(b)(2)(A) and (B). If a lower 
maximum offset limitation is provided 
by applicable State law, the creditor 
agency must advise Fiscal Service of the 
lower maximum offset limitation. 
(ii) Garnishment for support. The maximum allowable offset amount must 
be reduced by the amount of any 
deductions in pay resulting from a 
garnishment order for support. Nothing 
in this section will alter any rules 
applicable to processing garnishment 
orders for child support or alimony. 
(2) Pre-offset notice. At least 30 days before offset, the disbursing official will 
send written notice to the debtor: 
(i) Requesting that the debtor submit 
documentation that the disbursing 
official determines is needed to 
determine the applicable offset 
limitation under 15 U.S.C. 1673(b)(2)(A) 
and (B); and 
(ii) Providing the amount (by 
percentage or otherwise) that will be 
deducted if the debtor fails to submit 
the requested documentation. 
§ 285.34 Offset under reciprocal 
agreements with States. 
(a) Scope. This section sets forth the special rules applicable to offset of 
Federal nontax payments and State 
payments to collect debt under 
reciprocal agreements with participating 
SRP States. 
(b) General rule. In accordance with the terms of any applicable reciprocal 
agreement and this section, Fiscal 
Service and other disbursing officials 
will conduct Federal payment offset to 
collect delinquent State debts, and 
participating SRP States will conduct 
State payment offset to collect 
delinquent Federal debts. 
(c) Reciprocal agreements. (1) Fiscal Service and a State may enter into a 
reciprocal agreement. 
(2) A reciprocal agreement must: 
(i) Set forth all of the State’s 
requirements associated with State 
payment offset, including requirements 
of State law and any prohibitions on 
offsetting joint payments in accordance 
with § 285.2(f)(3); 
(ii) Require the State to prescribe 
procedures to govern the collection of 
delinquent State debts; 
(iii) Require that the State notify the 
payee or PEP of the State payment 
offset, providing the information 
required by § 285.2(g); 
(iv) Set forth the types of Federal 
payments that will be subject to offset 
to collect the State’s debts; 
(v) Set forth the types of State 
payments that will be subject to offset 
to collect Federal debts; 
(vi) Not impose any due process 
requirements on the collection of 
Federal debts beyond what is already 
required by this subpart; and 
(vii) Contain any other requirements 
that Fiscal Service considers 
appropriate. 
(d) Offsetting Federal payments to collect State debt—(1) Certification of State debt. At the time a participating 
SRP State refers a debt to TOP for 
collection by Federal payment offset 
under this section, the State must 
provide, in the manner required by 
Fiscal Service, written certification that: 
(i) The debt meets the requirements 
described in § 285.2(d)(1); 
(ii) The State has complied with all 
Federal and State statutes, regulations, 
policies, and contract provisions 
applicable to the collection of the debt 
through offset under this subpart;

certification has the delegated authority 
to make the certification on behalf of the 
State; 
(iv) With regard to past-due support, 
the State is authorized by HHS rules to 
refer the past-due support directly to 
TOP; and 
(v) The State has met such other 
requirements as Fiscal Service may from 
time to time impose. 
(2) Federal payments exempt from offset under this section. The following 
Federal payments are not eligible for 
offset under this section: 
(i) Payments exempted from offset 
under § 285.30(c)(2); 
(ii) Covered benefit payments; and 
(iii) Tax refund payments. 
(e) Offsetting State payments to collect Federal debt. Fiscal Service will 
refer a Federal debt to a participating 
SRP State only if Fiscal Service has 
received a certification from the creditor 
agency that the prerequisites specified 
in § 285.2(b) have been satisfied. 
(f) Fees. Fiscal Service may charge creditor agencies fees sufficient to cover 
up to the full cost of implementing 
Federal payment offset and State 
payment offset. A participating SRP 
State may not charge any Federal agency 
a fee for its cost of implementing offset 
under this section. 
§ 285.40 Offset of tax refund payments to 
collect Federal nontax debts, State debts, 
and debts owed to Tribal IV–D agencies. 
(a) Scope. This section and §§ 285.41 through 285.43 set forth rules applicable 
to the offset of tax refund payments 
through TOP. 
(b) General rule. All tax refund payments are eligible for centralized 
offset for the collection of Federal debts 
and, to the extent permitted under 
§§ 285.42 and 285.43, for State debts, 
and to the extent permitted under 
§ 285.42, for past-due support owed to 
Tribal IV–D agencies. 
(c) Reasonable efforts. Before referring a debt to TOP for collection by tax 
refund offset, the creditor agency must 
make reasonable efforts to collect the 
debt. The requirement to make 
reasonable efforts can be satisfied by 
making written demand for payment 
from the debtor and complying with any 
other prerequisites established by the 
creditor agency. 
(d) Notification of offset to the debtor. When a tax refund offset occurs, Fiscal 
Service will notify the debtor PEP and, 
if applicable, any non-debtor PEP. In 
addition to the requirements of 
§ 285.2(g), this notice will also include 
information regarding the steps any 
non-debtor PEP who may have filed a 
joint return with the debtor may take to 
secure their proper share of the tax 
refund. Failure to send an offset notice 
will not affect the validity of any offset. 
§ 285.41 Offset of tax refund payments to 
collect Federal nontax debts. 
With respect to the term ‘‘match,’’ as 
applied to this section, the Fiscal 
Service will use information to 
determine that the person entitled to 
payment on a payment record is the 
same person as the debtor on a debt 
record, including name control, 
taxpayer identifying number, and other 
necessary identifiers, if any. 
(a) Scope. This section sets forth special rules applicable to the offset of 
tax refund payments to collect 
delinquent Federal debts through TOP. 
(b) General rule. To the extent required by § 285.2(b)(1), Federal 
agencies must refer debts to TOP for 
collection through offset of tax refund 
payments, except that any agency 
subject to section 9 of the Act of May 
18, 1933 (16 U.S.C. 831h) may, but is 
not required to, refer delinquent debts to 
TOP for collection through offset of tax 
refund payments. 
(c) OASDI overpayments. Prior to referring a debt that resulted from an 
OASDI payment to an individual to 
TOP, the Social Security Administration 
must: 
(1) Determine that the individual is 
not currently entitled to monthly 
insurance benefits under title II of the 
Social Security Act; 
(2) In addition to the notice described 
in § 285.2(d)(1)(ii)(A), notify the debtor 
of the conditions under which the 
Social Security Administration is 
required to waive recovery of an 
overpayment, as provided under section 
204(b) of the Social Security Act; and 
(3) If the waiver referred to in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section is 
requested within the 60-day period 
referred to in § 285.2(d)(1)(ii)(A), render 
a decision on the waiver request under 
section 204(b) of the Social Security 
Act. 
(d) Fees. Fiscal Service will charge creditor agencies a fee to reimburse it 
for the full cost of applying the offset 
procedure. 
§ 285.42 Offset of tax refund payments to 
collect past-due support. 
As used in this section, the terms 
‘‘debt’’ and ‘‘past-due support’’ are 
synonymous. 
(a) Scope. This section sets forth special rules applicable to the offset of 
tax refund payments to collect past-due 
support through TOP. 
(b) General rule. In accordance with this section, HHS, a State, or a Tribal 
IV–D agency may refer past-due support 
to TOP, if either: 
(1) There has been an assignment of 
the support obligation to the State or 
Tribal IV–D agency; or 
(2) The State or Tribal IV–D agency is 
providing support collection services 
under 42 U.S.C. 654(4) or 45 CFR part 
309 and the amount of the past-due 
support is not less than $500.00. 
(c) Referral of past-due support to TOP—(1) By HHS. (i) A State or Tribal IV–D agency notifying HHS of past-due 
support must: 
(A) Do so in the manner and format 
prescribed by HHS; and 
(B) Certify that it has complied with 
the requirements in paragraph (d) of this 
section and with any of other 
requirements under State or Tribal law 
applicable to the offset of Federal tax 
refund payments to collect past-due 
support. 
(ii) HHS will refer to TOP the past- 
due support about which it received 
notice under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section. 
(iii) When HHS has knowledge that 
the debt is being enforced by a State or 
Tribal IV–D agency, HHS will inform 
any such State or Tribal IV–D agency 
when it receives any collections through 
offset under this subpart. 
(2) By States or Tribal IV–D agencies. (i) If authorized by HHS rules, a State or 
Tribal IV–D agency may refer past-due 
support directly to TOP. Otherwise, the 
State or Tribal IV–D agency must notify 
HHS of past-due support in accordance 
with the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section. 
(ii) A State or Tribal IV–D agency 
referring past-due support directly to 
TOP must: 
(A) Do so in the manner and format 
prescribed by Fiscal Service in separate 
guidance; and 
(B) Certify that it has complied with 
all requirements of this subpart and 
applicable State or Tribal law. 
(iii) When a State or Tribal IV–D 
agency has knowledge that the debt is 
being enforced by more than one State 
or Tribal IV–D agency, the State or 
Tribal IV–D agency referring the debt to 
TOP must inform any such other State 
or Tribal IV–D agency when it receives 
any collections through offset under this 
subpart. 
(d) Additional due process. The State or Tribal IV–D agency, or HHS if the 
State or Tribal IV–D agency requests and 
HHS agrees, must provide the due 
process specified by § 285.2(d)(1)(ii). In 
cases when a debt is being enforced by 
more than one State or Tribal IV–D 
agency, the written notification to the 
debtor must also advise the debtor of 
their opportunities to request a review 
with the State or Tribal IV–D agency 
enforcing collection or the State or

tax refund payment that was offset was 
erroneous or otherwise not due to the 
taxpayer; 
(2) The date of IRS’s notification to

charge a fee equal to the amount 
specified by 42 U.S.C. 664(b)(2)(B). 
§ 285.43 Offset of tax refund payments to 
collect State income tax and unemployment 
compensation debts. 
As used in this section, the term 
‘‘debt’’ means a State income tax 
obligation or unemployment 
compensation debt. 
(a) Scope. This section sets forth special rules applicable to the offset of 
tax refund payments to collect State 
income tax obligations and 
unemployment compensation debts. 
(b) General rules. (1) States may refer to TOP State income tax obligations and

report earnings; and 
(2) With respect to State income tax 
obligations: 
(i) Send the notice referred to in 
§ 285.2(d)(1)(ii) by certified mail, return 
receipt requested; and

are immune from State taxation by 
reason of being an enrolled member of 
a Federally recognized Tribe who lives 
on a reservation and derives all of their 
income from that reservation, have 
procedures that include a de novo 
review on the merits, unless such claims 
have been previously adjudicated by a

AGENCY: Coast Guard, DHS. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a security zone around 
vessels carrying Certain Dangerous 
Cargos (CDCs), for which the Captain of 
the Port, Corpus Christi deems 
enhanced security measures are 
necessary on a case-by-case basis. This 
security zone is needed to safeguard 
these vessels, the public, and the 
surrounding area from sabotage or other 
subversive acts, accidents, or other 
events of a similar nature. We invite 
your comments on this proposed 
rulemaking. 
DATES: Comments and related material must be received by the Coast Guard on 
or before January 22, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: You may submit comments identified by docket number USCG–

§ Section 
U.S.C. United States Code 
II. Background and Authority 
This proposed rule would establish a 
permanent security zone that could be 
activated as necessary to protect vessels 
carrying CDC bound for the Port of 
Corpus Christi. Vessels carrying CDC 
within the Captain of the Port Corpus 
Christi Zone are potential targets of 
terrorist attacks, or potential launch 
platforms for terrorist attacks on other 
vessels, waterfront facilities, and 
adjacent population centers. In the last 
2 years, the Port of Corpus Christi has 
seen more than 450 vessels enter or 
depart the port carrying CDCs, with that 
number projected to almost double in 
the next 15 years. 
The Coast Guard has previously 
created temporary security zones for 
individual vessel transits, see for 
example 89 FR 96533, December 5, 
2024. Continuing to create individual 
security zones will result in a significant 
administrative burden to the unit based 
on the expected number of future 
transits, and it will also delay public 
notice for individual security zone 
activations. Therefore, the Coast Guard 
is proposing to establish this permanent 
security zone to protect waterfront 
facilities, persons, and vessels from 
subversive or terrorist acts. The Coast 
Guard is proposing this rulemaking 
under authority in 46 U.S.C. 70051 and 
70124. 
Due to the potential of terrorist 
attacks, this proposed rule would allow 
the Captain of the Port to activate 
security zones around vessels carrying 
CDC as deemed necessary, on a case-by- 
case basis. By limiting access to the area 
immediately around these vessels, the 
Coast Guard is reducing potential 
methods of attack on these vessels, and 
potential use of the vessels to launch 
attacks on waterfront facilities and 
adjacent population centers located 
within the Captain of the Port zone. 
Vessels having need to enter these 
security zones must obtain express

or his designated representative prior to 
entry. 
III. Discussion of the Proposed Rule 
The Coast Guard proposes to establish 
a security zone around certain vessels 
carrying CDC, for which the Captain of 
the Port Corpus Christi deems enhanced 
security measures necessary on a case- 
by-case basis. These security zones 
would be activated for certain vessels 
within the COTP zone laden with CDC 
and transiting the Corpus Christi or La 
Quinta Shipping Channels. These 
security zones would encompass a 500- 
yard radius around these vessels while 
transiting the ship channel, or when 
moored at a facility and loading or 
unloading CDC. These security zones 
are needed to safeguard the vessels, the 
public, and the surrounding area from 
sabotage or other subversive acts, 
accidents, or other events of a similar 
nature. 
Vessels may transit through the 
security zone but must maintain the 
minimum speed necessary to maintain 
course, except no vessel may come 
within 100 yards of a vessel carrying 
CDC unless they first receive permission 
from the COTP. Vessels can request 
permission from the COTP to enter or 
transit through a security zone on VHF– 
FM channel 16 or by telephone at 361– 
939–0450. If permission is granted, all 
persons and vessels must comply with 
the instructions of the COTP or 
designated representative. The COTP or 
a designated representative will inform 
the public of the activation of security 
zones for CDC vessels through Broadcast 
Notice to Mariners and Marine Safety 
Information Bulletins (MSIBs) as 
appropriate for the enforcement times 
and dates for these security zones. 
IV. Regulatory Analyses 
We developed this proposed rule after 
considering numerous statutes and 
Executive orders related to rulemaking. 
Below we summarize our analyses 
based on a number of these statutes and 
Executive orders. 
A. Impact on Small Entities 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 
1980, 5 U.S.C. 601–612, as amended, 
requires Federal agencies to consider 
the potential impact of regulations on 
small entities during rulemaking. The 
term ‘‘small entities’’ comprises small 
businesses, not-for-profit organizations 
that are independently owned and 
operated and are not dominant in their 
fields, and governmental jurisdictions 
with populations of less than 50,000. 
The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 
605(b) that this proposed rule would not 
have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities 
for the following reasons. 
This rule will impact a small, 
designated area of 500-yards around a 
moving vessel in the Corpus Christi or 
La Quinta Shipping Channels over a 
period of six hours or less. Most vessels 
will be able to move around the security 
zone and therefore the impediment to 
the movement of other vessels will be 
minimal. Moreover, the rule allows 
other vessels to seek permission from 
the COTP to enter the zone. 
If you think that your business, 
organization, or governmental 
jurisdiction qualifies as a small entity 
and that this proposed rule would have 
a significant economic impact on it, 
please submit a comment (see 
ADDRESSES) explaining why you think it 
qualifies and how and to what degree 
this rule would economically affect it. 
Under section 213(a) of the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104–121), 
if this proposed rule will affect your 
small business, organization, or 
governmental jurisdiction and you have 
questions, contact the person listed in 
the 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 
section. Small businesses may send 
comments to the Small Business and 
Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement 
Ombudsman and the Regional Small 
Business Regulatory Fairness Boards by 
calling 1–888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734– 
3247). 
C. Collection of Information 
This proposed rule would not call for 
a new collection of information under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(44 U.S.C. 3501–3520). 
D. Federalism and Indian Tribal 
Governments 
We have analyzed this proposed rule 
under Executive Order 13132, 
Federalism, and have determined that it 
is consistent with the fundamental 
federalism principles and preemption 
requirements described in that Order. 
Also, this proposed rule does not have 
tribal implications under Executive 
Order 13175, Consultation and 
Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments, because it does not have 
a substantial direct effect on one or 
more Indian tribes, on the relationship 
between the Federal Government and 
Indian tribes, or on the distribution of 
power and responsibilities between the 
Federal Government and Indian tribes. 
E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
As required by The Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 
1531–1538), the Coast Guard certifies 
that this proposed rule will not result in 
an annual expenditure of $100,000,000 
or more (adjusted for inflation) by a 
State, local, or tribal government, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector. 
F. Environment 
We have analyzed this proposed rule 
under Department of Homeland 
Security Directive 023–01, Rev. 1, 
associated implementing instructions, 
and Environmental Planning 
COMDTINST 5090.1 (series), which 
guide the Coast Guard in complying 
with the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321–4370f), and 
have made a preliminary determination 
that this action is one of a category of 
actions that do not individually or 
cumulatively have a significant effect on 
the human environment. 
This proposed rule involves 
establishing a security zone around 
vessels laden with CDC as they transit 
through the Corpus Christi or La Quinta 
Shipping Channels. These transits 
typically last up to six hours. It will 
prohibit entry within a 500-yard radius 
of these vessels while transiting, and 
when loaded with CDC at the pier. 
Normally such actions are categorically 
excluded from further review under 
paragraph L60(a) of Appendix A, Table 
1 of DHS Instruction Manual 023–01– 
001–01, Rev. 1. We seek any comments 
or information that may lead to the 
discovery of a significant environmental 
impact from this proposed rule. 
V. Public Participation and Request for 
Comments 
We view public participation as 
essential to effective rulemaking and 
will consider all comments and material 
received during the comment period. 
Your comment can help shape the 
outcome of this rulemaking. If you 
submit a comment, please include the

cargo. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this section: 
Designated representative means a 
Coast Guard Patrol Commander, 
including a Coast Guard coxswain, petty

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On June 12, 2025, Commerce 
published the Preliminary Results of 
this administrative review in the 
Federal Register and invited interested 
parties to comment.
1
Due to the lapse in 
appropriations and Federal Government 
shutdown, on November 14, 2025, 
Commerce tolled all deadlines in 
administrative proceedings by 47 days.
2
 
Additionally, due to a backlog of 
documents that were electronically filed 
via Enforcement and Compliance’s 
Antidumping and Countervailing Duty 
Centralized Electronic Service System 
(ACCESS) during the Federal 
Government shutdown, on November 
24, 2025, Commerce tolled all deadlines 
in administrative proceedings by an 
additional 21 days.
3
Accordingly, the 
deadline for these final results is now 
December 17, 2025. For a complete 
description of the events that occurred 
since the Preliminary Results, see the 
Issues and Decision Memorandum.
4
 
Scope of the Order
5
 
The merchandise covered by the 
Order is aluminum sheet from China. For a complete description of the scope 
of the of the Order, see the Issues and 
Decision Memorandum. 
Analysis of Comments Received 
All issues raised by the interested 
parties in their case briefs and rebuttal 
briefs are addressed in the Issues and 
Decision Memorandum. A list of the 
issues raised is attached as an appendix 
to this notice. The Issues and Decision 
Memorandum is a public document and

Changes Since the Preliminary Results 
Based on a review of the record and 
analysis of comments received from 
interested parties, we made changes to 
the Preliminary Results. For a full description of these revisions, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
Methodology 
Commerce conducted this 
administrative review in accordance 
with section 751(a)(1)(A) of the Tariff 
Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). For 
each of the subsidy programs found to 
be countervailable, we determine that 
there is a subsidy, i.e., a financial contribution from a government or 
public entity that gives rise to a benefit 
to the recipient, and that the subsidy is 
specific.
6
The subsidy programs under 
review, and the issues raised in case and 
rebuttal briefs submitted by the 
interested parties, are discussed in the 
Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
Final Results of Administrative Review 
Commerce determines the following 
net countervailable subsidy rates for the 
period January 1, 2023, through 
December 31, 2023:

announcement or, if there is no public 
announcement, within five days of the 
date of publication of the notice of final 
results in the Federal Register, in 
accordance with 19 CFR 351.224(b). 
Assessment 
Pursuant to section 751 (a)(2)(C) of the 
Act and 19 CFR 351.212(b)(2), 
Commerce has determined, and U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
shall assess, countervailing duties on all 
appropriate entries of subject 
merchandise in accordance with the 
final results of this review, for the 
above-listed companies at the applicable 
ad valorem assessment rates. Commerce 
intends to issue assessment instructions 
to CBP no earlier than 35 days after the 
publication of the final results of this 
review in the Federal Register. If a 
timely summons is filed at the U.S. 
Court of International Trade, the 
assessment instructions will direct CBP 
not to liquidate relevant entries until the 
time for parties to file a request for a 
statutory injunction has expired (i.e., 
within 90 days of publication). 
Cash Deposit Instructions 
In accordance with section 
751(a)(2)(C) of the Act, Commerce also 
intends to instruct CBP to collect cash 
deposits of estimated countervailing 
duties in the amounts shown for each 
company above on shipments of subject 
merchandise entered, or withdrawn 
from warehouse, for consumption on or 
after the date of publication of the final 
results of this administrative review, 
except where the rate calculated in the 
final results is zero or de minimis. For 
all non-reviewed firms, we will instruct 
CBP to collect cash deposits of 
estimated countervailing duties at the 
most recent company specific or all- 
others rate applicable to the company, 
as appropriate. These cash deposit 
requirements, effective upon 
publication of these final results, shall 
remain in effect until further notice. 
Administrative Protective Order (APO) 
This notice also serves as a final 
reminder to parties subject to an APO of 
their responsibility concerning the 
disposition of proprietary information 
disclosed under APO in accordance 
with 19 CFR 351.305(a)(3). Timely 
written notification of the return or 
destruction of APO materials or 
conversion to judicial protective order, 
is hereby requested. Failure to comply 
with the regulations and terms of an 
APO is a sanctionable violation. 
Notification to Interested Parties 
Commerce is issuing the final results 
and publishing this notice in 
accordance with sections 751(a)(l) and 
777(i)(l) of the Act, and 19 CFR 
351.221(b)(5).

Decision 
AGENCY: Enforcement and Compliance, International Trade Administration, 
Department of Commerce. 
SUMMARY: On October 20, 2025, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) 
issued its final judgment in Elysium 
Tiles, Inc. et al v. United States, Court No. 23–00041, sustaining the U.S. 
Department of Commerce (Commerce)’s 
second remand redetermination 
pertaining to the scope ruling for the 
antidumping duty and countervailing 
duty orders on ceramic tile from the 
People’s Republic of China. Commerce 
is notifying the public that the CIT’s 
final judgment is not in harmony with 
Commerce’s scope ruling, and that 
Commerce is amending the scope ruling 
to find that Elysium Tiles, Inc. and 
Elysium Tile Florida, Inc. (collectively, 
Elysium)’s composite tile is not covered 
by the scope of the Orders.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On January 25, 2023, Commerce 
found Elysium’s composite tile to be 
covered by the scope of the Orders.
2
On 
July 18, 2024, the CIT remanded 
Commerce’s final scope ruling as 
unsupported by substantial evidence 
and not in accordance with law.
3
 
The CIT held that Commerce: (1) 
failed to provide an adequate summary 
of an ex parte meeting; and (2) failed to 
show with substantial evidence that 
either, under 19 CFR 351.225(k)(1), the 
Orders’ scope language contemplates products such as marble composite tile, 
or that, under 19 CFR 351.225(k)(2), the 
marble composite tile truly is 
considered a form of ceramic tile in 
purpose, function, advertising, and use.

In its first remand redetermination,
5
 
Commerce supplemented the ex parte 
memorandum to provide a more 
detailed summary, and Commerce 
continued to find that Elysium’s 
composite tile was within the scope

based upon the plain language of the 
scope, which included ceramic tile with 
decorative features. 
On March 11, 2025, the CIT sustained, 
in part, and remanded, in part, 
Commerce’s First Remand Redetermination.
6
In the Second 
Remand Order, the CIT held that the 
summary of the ex parte meeting was 
adequate.
7
However, the CIT remanded 
Commerce’s First Remand Redetermination, instructing Commerce to consider the five additional factors 
set out in 19 CFR 351.225(k)(2)(i).
8
 
Pursuant to the Second Remand Order, 
in its final remand redetermination, 
Commerce analyzed the factors set out 
in 19 CFR 351.225(k)(2)(i) and 
determined, based on those factors, that 
Elysium’s composite tile is not covered 
by the scope of the Orders.

The CIT 
sustained Commerce’s final 
redetermination.

Timken Notice 
In its decision in Timken,
11
as 
clarified by Diamond Sawblades,
12
the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal 
Circuit held that, pursuant to section 
516A(c) and (e) of the Tariff Act of 1930, 
as amended (the Act), Commerce must 
publish a notice of court decision that 
is not ‘‘in harmony’’ with a Commerce 
determination and must suspend 
liquidation of entries pending a 
‘‘conclusive’’ court decision. The CIT’s 
October 20, 2025, judgment constitutes 
a final decision of the CIT that is not in 
harmony with Commerce’s Final Scope 
Ruling. Thus, this notice is published in 
fulfillment of the publication 
requirements of Timken. 
Amended Final Scope Ruling 
In accordance with the CIT’s October 
20, 2025, final judgment, Commerce is 
amending its Final Scope Ruling and 
finds that the scope of the order does 
not cover the products addressed in the 
Final Scope Ruling. 
Liquidation of Suspended Entries 
Commerce will instruct U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection (CBP) that, 
pending any appeals, the cash deposit 
rate will be zero percent for Elysium’s 
composite tile. In the event that the 
CIT’s final judgment is not appealed or 
is upheld on appeal, Commerce will 
instruct CBP to liquidate entries of 
ceramic tile without regard to 
antidumping and countervailing duties 
and to lift suspension of liquidation of 
such entries. 
At this time, Commerce remains 
enjoined by the CIT from liquidating 
entries not covered by the scope of the 
Orders by the Final Scope Ruling. These entries will remain enjoined pursuant to 
the terms of the injunction during the 
pendency of any appeals process. 
Notification to Interested Parties 
This notice is issued and published in 
accordance with sections 516A(c) and 
(e), and 777(i)(1) of the Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Abstract 
On March 26, 2025, the President 
issued Proclamation 10908, ‘‘Adjusting 
Imports of Automobiles and Automobile 
Parts Into the United States,’’ 90 FR 
14705 (April 3, 2025) (Automobile 
Proclamation), which finds that imports 
of automobiles and certain automobile 
parts continue to threaten to impair the 
national security of the United States 
and imposes specified tariffs to adjust 
imports of automobiles and certain 
automobile parts so that such imports 
will not threaten to impair national 
security pursuant to Section 232 of the 
Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (‘‘Section 
232’’). Section 232 authorizes the 
President to adjust the imports of an 
article and its derivatives that are being 
imported into the United States in such 
quantities or under such circumstances 
as to threaten to impair the national 
security of the United States so that 
such imports will not threaten to impair 
national security. The Automobile 
Proclamation imposed a 25 percent 
tariff on certain imports of automobiles, 
effective April 3, 2025, and certain 
imports of automobile parts, effective 
May 3, 2025. 
The Automobile Proclamation also 
required the Secretary of Commerce 
(Secretary) to establish a process for 
including additional automobile parts 
articles within the scope of the tariffs 
imposed by the President in the 
Automobile Proclamation. In addition to 
inclusions made by the Secretary, the 
process is to provide for including 
additional automobile parts articles at 
the request of a domestic producer of an 
automobile or automobile parts article, 
or an industry association representing 
one or more such producers, where the 
request establishes that imports of

additional automobile parts articles 
have increased in a manner that 
threatens to impair the national security 
or otherwise undermines the objectives 
set forth in Proclamation 9888 (84 FR 
23433, May 17, 2019), the Automobile 
Proclamation, or in any proclamation 
issued under Section 232 of the Trade 
Expansion Act of 1962, as amended 
(Section 232) or any additional 
information submitted to the President 
by the Secretary pursuant to those 
proclamations. When the Secretary 
receives such a request from a domestic 
producer or industry association, the 
Secretary, after consultation with the 
United States International Trade 
Commission and U. S. Customs and 
Border Protection, is to issue a 
determination regarding whether to 
include the articles within 60 days of 
receiving the request. 
The automotive industry is in a state 
of rapid development for various 
technologies, including in the areas of 
alternative propulsion systems, 
autonomous driving capabilities, and 
other advanced technologies. It is 
important that manufacturers 
supporting both the commercial vehicle 
industry and the defense sector have the 
opportunity to identify new and 
emerging automotive products with 
importance for defense applications to 
be considered under the scope of this 
action. In addition, there are many 
automotive products that fall under 
broad tariff codes that include parts 
beyond the automotive sector. While the 
Department made a best estimate of the 
most important tariff codes to apply to 
the scope of the 232 action, industry 
experts may be aware of broad 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) 
codes that have become increasingly 
important to automotive uses that were 
not originally considered under this 
investigation. 
II. Method of Collection 
Domestic producers of automobiles or 
automobile parts articles, or any 
industry association representing one or 
more such producers, may submit 
automobile parts articles inclusion 
requests during two-week submission 
windows that ITA will open four times 
annually. Submissions of inclusions 
requests must be submitted in PDF 
format via email to AutoInclusions@
trade.gov. ITA will review the requests received on a rolling basis during the 
two-week submission window to 
validate that each request received 
contain all the required elements and 
does not exceed the page limitation. In 
the instance where the requestor does 
not include all the required elements or 
otherwise improperly filed the 
submission, at the discretion of the 
Under Secretary for International Trade, 
the requestor will be granted a 48-hour 
window to submit a proper filing. The 
use of fixed submission windows will 
provide predictability to industry and 
will be the most efficient use of ITA 
resources given the short timeframes to 
secure and process public comments 
and provide recommendations.

Determination of Industry Support for 
the Petitions 
Sections 702(b)(1) and 732(b)(1) of the 
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), 
require that a petition be filed by or on 
behalf of the domestic industry. To 
determine that the petition has been 
filed by or on behalf of the industry, 
sections 702(c)(4)(A) and 732(c)(4)(A) of 
the Act require that the domestic 
producers or workers who support the 
petition account for: (i) at least 25 
percent of the total production of the 
domestic like product; and (ii) more 
than 50 percent of the production of the 
domestic like product produced by that 
portion of the industry expressing 
support for, or opposition to, the 
petition. Moreover, sections 702(c)(4)(D) 
and 732(c)(4)(D) of the Act provide that, 
if the petition does not establish support 
of domestic producers or workers 
accounting for more than 50 percent of 
the total production of the domestic like 
product, Commerce shall: (i) poll the 
industry or rely on other information in 
order to determine if there is support for 
the petition, as required by 
subparagraph (A); or (ii) if there is a 
large number of producers, determine 
industry support using a statistically 
valid sampling method to poll the 
industry. 
Extension of Time 
Sections 702(c)(1)(A) and 732(c)(1)(A) 
of the Act provide that within 20 days 
of the filing of an antidumping or 
countervailing duty petition, Commerce 
will determine, inter alia, whether the 
petition has been filed by or on behalf 
of the U.S. industry producing the 
domestic like product. Sections 
702(c)(1)(B) and 732(c)(1)(B) of the Act 
provide that the deadline for the 
initiation determination, in exceptional 
circumstances, may be extended by 20 
days in any case in which Commerce 
must ‘‘poll or otherwise determine 
support for the petition by the 
industry.’’ Because it is not clear from 
the Petitions whether the industry 
support criteria have been met, 
Commerce has determined it would be 
appropriate in these cases to poll the 
industry and extend the time period for 
determining whether to initiate the 
investigations in order to further 
examine the issue of industry support. 
Commerce will need additional time 
to gather and analyze additional 
information regarding industry support. 
Therefore, it is necessary to extend the 
deadline for determining the adequacy 
of the Petitions by an additional 20 
days. As a result, in accordance with 
sections 702(c)(1)(B) and 732(c)(1)(B) of 
the Act, Commerce’s initiation 
determination will now be due no later 
than January 2, 2026. 
International Trade Commission 
Notification 
Commerce will contact the U.S. 
International Trade Commission (ITC) 
and will make this extension notice 
available to the ITC.

Analysis of Comments Received 
All issues raised in the case and 
rebuttal briefs that parties submitted in 
this review are addressed in the Issues 
and Decision Memorandum. A list of 
the issues that parties raised, and to 
which we responded in the Issues and 
Decision Memorandum, is provided in 
Appendix I to this notice. The Issues 
and Decision Memorandum is a public 
document and is on file electronically 
via Enforcement and Compliance’s 
Antidumping and Countervailing Duty 
Centralized Electronic Service System 
(ACCESS). ACCESS is available to 
registered users at https://access.
trade.gov. In addition, a complete version of the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum can be accessed directly 
at https://access.trade.gov/public/ FRNoticesListLayout.aspx. 
Final Determination of No Shipments 
In the Preliminary Results, Commerce 
determined that Jinko Solar,
7
Longi 
Solar Technology Co. Ltd. (Longi Solar), 
and Zhejiang Aiko Solar Energy 
Technology Co., Ltd. (Zhejiang Aiko) 
did not ship subject merchandise to the 
United States during the POR. No 
parties filed timely arguments disputing 
Commerce’s no shipment 
determination.
8
In these final results of 
review, we continue to find that Jinko 
Solar, Longi Solar, and Zhejiang Aiko 
did not ship subject merchandise to the 
United States during the POR. 
Rescission of Administrative Review, in 
Part 
In the Preliminary Results, Commerce 
determined that there were no entries of 
Red Sun Energy Long An Company 
Limited’s (Red Sun) solar cells/modules 
into the United States during the POR 
that were suspended and subject to 
antidumping duties, and thus, 
consistent with its practice, Commerce 
stated that it intended to rescind this 
review with respect to Red Sun. No 
parties commented on this preliminary 
determination. In the absence of any 
suspended entries of subject 
merchandise from Red Sun during the 
POR, Commerce is rescinding this 
review with respect to Red Sun. 
Separate Rates 
No parties commented on 
Commerce’s preliminary determination 
to grant separate rates to certain 
companies
9
and to not grant a separate 
rate to Anji DaSol Solar Energy Science 
& Technology Co., Ltd. We have made 
no changes to Commerce’s preliminary 
separate rates determination in these 
final results of review. 
Dumping Margins for Separate Rate 
Companies 
The statute and Commerce’s 
regulations do not address what 
dumping margin to apply to 
respondents that are not selected for 
individual examination in an 
administrative review pursuant to 
section 777A(c)(2) of the Act. Generally, 
Commerce looks to section 735(c)(5) of 
the Act, which provides instructions for 
calculating the all-others rate in an 
investigation, for guidance when 
calculating the dumping margin for 
respondents that are not individually 
examined in an administrative review. 
Under section 735(c)(5)(A) of the Act, 
the all-others rate is normally ‘‘equal to 
the weighted average of the estimated 
weighted average dumping margins 
established for exporters and producers 
individually investigated, excluding any 
zero and de minimis dumping margins, 
and any dumping margins determined 
entirely {on the basis of facts available}.’’ Because we calculated a 
dumping margin that is not zero, de 
minimis, or based entirely on facts available for Sungold, the sole 
participating mandatory respondent, we 
assigned the separate rate recipients that 
we did not individually examine a 
dumping margin equal to Sungold’s 
dumping margin consistent with 
Commerce’s practice and section 
735(c)(5)(A) of the Act. For additional 
information, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
China-Wide Entity 
Commerce’s policy regarding 
conditional review of the China-wide 
entity applies to this administrative 
review.
10
Under this policy, the China- 
wide entity will not be under review 
unless a party specifically requests, or 
Commerce self-initiates, a review of the 
entity. Because no party requested that 
Commerce review the China-wide entity 
in this segment of the proceeding, the 
China-wide entity is not under review 
and its dumping margin (i.e., 238.95 percent
11
) is not subject to change. 
Because there were no entries of subject 
merchandise from the companies listed 
in Appendix II of this notice during the 
POR, none of which had a separate rate 
during the POR, these companies 
remain in the China-wide entity.
12
In 
addition, because Commerce did not 
grant a separate rate to Anji DaSol Solar 
Energy Science & Technology Co., Ltd., 
this company is part of the China-wide 
entity. 
Final Results of Review 
Commerce determines that the 
following estimated weighted-average 
dumping margins exist for the period 
December 1, 2022, through November 
30, 2023:

calculations that it performed for these 
final results of review to the parties to 
this proceeding within five days of any 
public announcement or, if there is no 
public announcement, within five days 
of the date of publication of this notice 
in the Federal Register in accordance 
with 19 CFR 351.224(b). 
Assessment Rates 
Pursuant to section 751(a)(2)(C) of the 
Act and 19 CFR 351.212(b)(1), 
Commerce has determined, and U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
shall assess, antidumping duties on all 
appropriate entries of subject 
merchandise covered by the final results 
of this review.
13
Commerce intends to 
issue assessment instructions to CBP no 
earlier than 35 days after the publication 
date of these final results in the Federal 
Register. If a timely summons is filed at 
the U.S. Court of International Trade, 
the assessment instructions will direct 
CBP not to liquidate relevant entries 
until the time for parties to file a request 
for a statutory injunction has expired 
(i.e., within 90 days of publication). In accordance with 19 CFR 
351.212(b)(1), we calculated importer- 
specific assessment rates for Sungold by 
dividing the total amount of dumping 
calculated for all reviewed U.S. sales of 
subject merchandise entered by an 
importer by the total entered value of 
those sales.
14
Where an importer- 
specific ad valorem assessment rate is not zero or de minimis, Commerce will 
instruct CBP to collect the appropriate 
duties at the time of liquidation. Where 
an importer -specific ad valorem 
assessment rate is zero or de minimis, 
Commerce will instruct CBP to liquidate 
the appropriate entries without regard to 
antidumping duties. Pursuant to a 
refinement to Commerce’s assessment 
practice, where Sungold did not report 
a sale of subject merchandise that was 
entered into the United States during 
the POR under its company-specific 
CBP case number, Commerce will 
instruct CBP to liquidate any entries of 
such merchandise at the weighted- 
average dumping margin for the China- 
wide entity (i.e., 238.95 percent) if there is no rate for the intermediate 
company(ies) involved in the 
transaction.
15
 
Commerce intends to instruct CBP to 
assess antidumping duties on all POR 
entries of subject merchandise exported 
by the separate rate companies listed in 
the above table at a rate equal to the 
estimated dumping margin determined 
for Sungold.
16
 
Additionally, Commerce intends to 
instruct CBP to assess antidumping 
duties on all subject merchandise 
entered during the POR under the 
company-specific CBP case number of 
Jinko Solar, Longi Solar, or Zhejiang 
Aiko at the China-wide rate. 
Anji DaSol Solar Energy Science & 
Technology Co., Ltd., and the 
companies listed in Appendix II of this 
notice are not eligible for a separate rate 
and thus are part of the China-wide 
entity. Commerce intends to instruct 
CBP to assess antidumping duties on all 
POR entries of subject merchandise 
exported by Anji DaSol Solar Energy 
Science & Technology Co., Ltd., at a rate 
equal to 238.95 percent (i.e., the China- wide entity rate). Although CBP data on 
the record does not show any entries of 
subject merchandise during the POR 
from the companies listed in Appendix 
II of this notice, if there are such entries 
they will be assessed antidumping 
duties at the China-wide entity rate of 
238.95 percent. 
Cash Deposit Requirements 
The following cash deposit 
requirements will be in effect for all 
shipments of subject merchandise 
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, 
for consumption on, or after, the date of 
publication of this notice in the Federal 
Register, as provided for by section 
751(a)(2)(C) of the Act: (1) for the 
companies listed in the rate table in the 
‘‘Final Results of Review’’ section of this 
notice above, the cash deposit rate will 
be equal to the weighted-average 
dumping margin listed for the company 
in the table; (2) for previously 
investigated or reviewed Chinese and 
non-Chinese companies that are not 
listed in the rate table above that have 
separate rates, the cash deposit rate will 
continue to be the company’s existing 
cash deposit rate; (3) for all China 
exporters of subject merchandise that do 
not have a separate rate, the cash 
deposit rate will be equal to the 
weighted-average dumping margin 
assigned to the China-wide entity, 
which is 238.95 percent, and (4) for all 
non-China exporters of subject 
merchandise that do not have a separate 
rate, the cash deposit rate will be equal 
to the weighted-average dumping 
margin applicable to the China 
exporter(s) that supplied that non-China 
exporter. These cash deposit 
requirements, when imposed, shall 
remain in effect until further notice. 
Notification to Importers 
This notice serves as a final reminder 
to importers of their responsibility 
under 19 CFR 351.402(f)(2) to file a 
certificate regarding the reimbursement 
of antidumping duties and/or 
countervailing duties prior to 
liquidation of the relevant entries 
during this POR. Failure to comply with 
this requirement could result in 
Commerce’s presumption that 
reimbursement of antidumping duties 
and/or countervailing duties has 
occurred, and the subsequent 
assessment of double antidumping 
duties, and/or an increase in the amount 
of antidumping duties by the amount of 
the countervailing duties. 
Administrative Protective Order (APO) 
This notice also serves as a final 
reminder to parties subject to an APO of 
their responsibility to return or destroy 
proprietary information disclosed under 
an APO in accordance with 19 CFR 
351.305(a)(3). Timely written 
notification of the return or destruction 
of APO materials or conversion to 
judicial protective order is hereby 
requested. Failure to comply with the 
regulations and terms of an APO is a 
violation subject to sanction. 
Notification to Interested Parties 
Commerce is issuing and publishing 
the final results of this administrative 
review in accordance with sections 
751(a)(1) and 777(i)(1) of the Act, and 19 
CFR 351.221(b)(5).

federally permitted fishing vessels to 
fish outside fishery regulations in 
support of exempted fishing activities 
proposed by the Cape Cod Commercial 
Fishermen’s Alliance. Regulations 
under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act 
require publication of this notification 
to provide interested parties the 
opportunity to comment on applications 
for proposed EFPs. 
DATES: Comments must be received on or before January 7, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: You may submit written comments by email: nmfs.gar.efp@
noaa.gov. Include in the subject line ‘‘CCCFA SCOQ EFP.’’ All comments 
received are a part of the public record 
and may be posted for public viewing 
without change. All personal identifying 
information (e.g., name, address), confidential business information, or 
otherwise sensitive information 
submitted voluntarily by the sender will

Specialist, christine.ford@noaa.gov, 978–281–9185. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The applicant submitted a complete 
application for an EFP to conduct 
commercial fishing activities that the 
regulations would otherwise restrict. 
This EFP would exempt the 
participating vessels from the following 
Federal regulations: 
TABLE1—REQUESTEDEXEMPTIONS

Project Narrative 
This project builds on initial work 
completed approximately a decade ago 
from 2014 through 2015, as well as work 
from a partial season in 2025, and 
reflects renewed interest in surfclams 
and ocean quahogs by the Cape Cod 
small boat fleet and by a new, local 
dealer/processor that normally buys 
from state waters surfclam boats and 
accepts smaller increments. The 
previous test from 10 years ago using 
alternative containers and tags showed 
promise, but buyers at the time would 
not accept non-standard cages, limiting 
the market viability of the alternative 
cages. Between July 11, 2025, and 
September 30, 2025, 11 trips were taken 
under the 2025 EFP. Over 2,500 bushels 
of surfclams were landed, with no safety 
incidents. Participants were able to sell 
almost half the catch to live and 
specialty markets, at a higher price 
point, as the percentage of broken clams 
dropped from 30 to 9 percent. This EFP 
would collect data to support a future 
regulatory request to permanently allow 
small boats to land surfclams and ocean 
quahogs in smaller increments. 
This EFP would authorize three 
vessels to continue to develop the 
viability of a day-boat Atlantic surfclam 
and ocean quahog fishery for small 
vessels based out of Cape Cod by testing 
alternatives to the large industry- 
standard cages and 32-bushel (1.7 m
3
) 
cage tags. The traditional cages do not 
fit on smaller day boats and, as a result, 
vessels not capable of carrying a cage 
onboard must offload directly into 
cages. This can be burdensome and 
dangerous and the extra handling and 
compression of clams in the cages can 
lead to damaged product and lower 
market value. Many ports do not have 
the infrastructure to safely offload into 
cages and the local dealer dedicated to 
buying the catch is not capable of 
handling 32-bushel cages. All 
participating vessels would have open 
access permits and receive tags from one 
of the participants with allocation. 
The participating vessels would use 
two alternative landing containers: a 
standard-size fish vat (internal 
measurements: 44 inch x 39 inch x 27 
inch; 1.12 meter (m) x 0.99 m x 0.69 m) 
capable of holding 16 bushels (0.85 m
3
); 
and a standard-size stackable fish tote 
(internal measurements: 25 inch x 15.8 
inch x 10.2 inch; 0.64 m x 0.40 m x 0.26 
m) capable of holding 1.5 bushels (0.08 
m
3
). One alternative denomination of a 
16-bushel tag would be used, either on 
a fish vat or on a pallet of 10 1.5-bushel 
totes wrapped in plastic wrap. The 
participants acknowledge the loss of 1 
bushel (0.05 m
3
) worth of catch for each 
pallet tagged. The vats would be 
constrained to weigh no more than 
1,424 pounds (0.65 metric tons (mt)). 
The totes on a pallet would also be 
constrained to weigh no more than 
1,424 pounds (but likely to only weigh 
1,335 pounds (0.61 mt)). Weight 
samples would be taken by the dealer to 
verify weights to further develop the 
experimental containers. The applicant 
would work with NMFS and the 
National Band and Tag Company to 
convert standard cage tags into the 
alternative tag denomination. Up to 500 
32-bushel ocean quahog tags and up to 
270 32-bushel surf clam tags would be 
converted to 16-bushel tags. 
Participating fishermen would 
complete a data sheet for each EFP trip 
to provide information on price per 
bushel and weight for each landing 
increment. Landings data would be 
verified with collection of dealer reports 
for each EFP trip. The proportion of 
breakages vs. live would be tested 
through collection of processor data 
detailing surfclam quality and 
condition. Annual surveys to measure 
impact and determine progress against 
the measures of success will be 
completed and the effects of using 
modified landing containers and 
alternative tags will be analyzed to 
determine what, if any, benefits the EFP 
protocol provides to economic viability 
and safety of small boat surfclam/ocean 
quahog fishing businesses. 
If approved, the applicant may 
request minor modifications and 
extensions to the EFP throughout the 
year. EFP modifications and extensions 
may be granted without further notice if 
they are deemed essential to facilitate 
completion of the proposed research 
and have minimal impacts that do not 
change the scope or impact of the 
initially approved EFP request. Any 
fishing activity conducted outside the 
scope of the exempted fishing activity 
would be prohibited.

NOAA will conduct the virtual public 
hearings via Adobe Connect. Each 
person who wants to attend either 
virtual public hearing must 
electronically register by January 21, 
2026, 5 p.m. Eastern Time. Attendance 
at each virtual public hearing will be 
limited to 1,000 individuals for each of 
the two dates; therefore, NOAA requests 
that individuals register and attend only 
one hearing, on either January 27 or 
January 28, 2026. To register for either 
hearing, use the following link: https:// 
noaabroadcast.adobeconnect.com/ 
evxcqr87egzq/event/event_info.html. Any person who registers and wants to 
speak at a virtual public hearing should 
indicate that they want to speak during 
registration. Each registered participant 
will receive an Adobe Connect link for 
the virtual public hearing. 
Once the virtual public hearing starts, 
NOAA will describe the virtual public 
hearing logistics. NOAA will then start 
the public comment part of the virtual 
public hearing and will call on speakers 
on a first come/first served basis 
through the raised hand function of 
Adobe Connect. NOAA will then 
unmute the person speaking. Each 
speaker will have three minutes to 
speak on either or both applications 
(TMC USA Application A and/or TMC 
USA Application B). If a speaker does 
not respond when they are called on, 
NOAA will move to the next speaker. At 
the three-minute mark for each speaker,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Endangered Species Act (ESA)-Listed 
Species Covered in This Notice 
€Hood Canal-Strait of Juan de Fuca summer chum salmon (Oncorhynchus 
keta): threatened, naturally and 
artificially propagated; 
€Puget Sound Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha): 
threatened, naturally and artificially 
propagated; and 
€Puget Sound Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss): threatened, 
naturally and artificially propagated. 
Background 
The term ‘‘take’’ is defined under the 
ESA to mean harass, harm, pursue, 
hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, 
or collect, or to attempt to engage in any 
such conduct. The ESA prohibits the 
take of endangered salmonids and, 
pursuant to ESA section 4(d), ESA 
regulations can be extended to prohibit 
the take of threatened salmonids. 
However, NMFS may make exceptions 
to the take prohibitions for hatchery 
programs that are approved by NMFS 
under the limits on the prohibitions 
outlined in 50 CFR 223.203(b). The 
operators, WDFW collaborating with 
tribal co-manager Jamestown S’Klallam 
Tribe, have submitted an HGMP to 
NMFS pursuant to NMFS’ Limit 6 of the 
4(d) Rule of the ESA for hatchery 
activities in the Skokomish River basin, 
Washington. The PEPD is NMFS’ initial 
determination for how the HGMP 
addresses the criteria in 50 CFR 
223.203(b)(5). 
The hatchery program under review is 
designed to contribute to the 
reintroduction and recovery of Chinook 
salmon, sockeye salmon and steelhead 
in the Skokomish River basin. These 
fish contribute to the stability of Pacific 
salmon fish stocks in order to maintain 
sustainable U.S. fisheries and strengthen 
the national seafood supply chain. The 
hatchery programs are intended to 
contribute to fulfilling federal trust 
responsibilities toward Tribes with 
rights guaranteed through treaties, as 
affirmed in United States v. Washington (1974), by contributing to the recovery 
of ESA-listed salmon. Additionally, the 
programs are intended to contribute to 
the survival and recovery of Puget 
Sound Chinook Salmon and Puget 
Sound Steelhead, provide information 
on exploitation rates, and support 
returns of coho salmon, Chinook 
salmon, and sockeye salmon to the 
Skokomish River basin. 
Classification 
Under section 4 of the ESA, the 
Secretary of Commerce is required to 
adopt such regulations as deemed 
necessary and advisable for the 
conservation of species listed as 
threatened. The ESA salmon and 
steelhead 4(d) Rule (50 CFR 223.203(b)) 
specifies categories of activities that 
contribute to the conservation of listed 
salmonids and sets out the criteria for 
such activities. The rule further 
provides that the prohibitions of 
paragraph (a) of the rule do not apply to 
actions undertaken in compliance with 
a plan developed jointly by a state and 
a tribe and determined by NMFS to be 
in accordance with the salmon and 
steelhead 4(d) Rule (65 FR 42422, July 
10, 2000).

sponsor of this information collection. 
This information collection contains 
applications, permits, and reports 
required under the Community Quota 
Entity (CQE) Program. The revision to 
this collection incorporates minor 
updates for clarity and regulatory 
accuracy. These changes to the forms 
include updating the Public Reporting 
Burden Statement to include the form’s 
specific purpose and updating website 
links. Additionally, the ‘‘Application for 
Transfer of Quota Share to or from a 
Community Quota Entity’’ form was 
updated to include the correct the 
language from ‘‘The party to whom a 
CQE is seeking to transfer the IFQ must 
hold a Transfer Eligibility Certificate 
(TEC) unless they are a resident of the 
Aleutian Islands (Adak) for at least 12 
months’’ to ‘‘The party to whom a CQE 
is seeking to transfer the IFQ must hold 
a Transfer Eligibility Certificate (TEC) 
unless they hold an Aleutian Islands 
(Adak) TEC.’’ This change accurately 
reflects current regulations and 
requirements. No other changes were 
made to the collection other than 
adjustments to reflect the most current 
available data. 
NMFS AKR manages the groundfish 
fisheries in the exclusive economic zone 
of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands 
management area under the Fishery 
Management Plan for Groundfish of the 
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands 
Management Area. The Magnuson- 
Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) 
authorizes the North Pacific Fishery 
Management Council to prepare and 
amend fishery management plans for 
any fishery in waters under its 
jurisdiction. The International Pacific 
Halibut Commission (IPHC) and NMFS 
AKR manage fishing for Pacific halibut 
(Hippoglossus stenolepis) through 
regulations established under the 
authority of the Northern Pacific Halibut 
Act of 1982, 16 U.S.C. 773c (Halibut 
Act). 
The CQE Program is a Federal 
program administered by NMFS. The 
CQE Program allocates to eligible 
communities in Alaska a portion of the 
harvest quotas for groundfish, halibut, 
crab, and prohibited species. The 
allocations provide these communities 
the means for starting or supporting 
commercial fisheries activities that will 
result in an ongoing, regionally based, 
fisheries-related economy. Participating 
communities are represented by a CQE, 
which is a NMFS-approved non-profit 
organization. 
Under the Pacific Halibut and 
Sablefish Individual Fishing Quota 
(IFQ) Program, a CQE may purchase 
commercial Halibut and sablefish quota 
share (QS) for lease to residents of the 
eligible community. Under the Charter 
Halibut Limited Access Program, a CQE 
may request community charter halibut 
permits for use in southeast Alaska and 
the central Gulf of Alaska by charter 
vessel operators designated by the CQE. 
Under the License Limitation Program 
(LLP), a CQE may request non-trawl 
groundfish LLP licenses endorsed for 
Pacific cod in the central or western 
Gulf of Alaska for use on vessels 
designated by the CQE. More 
information on the CQEs and the CQE 
Program is provided on the NMFS 
Alaska Region website at https://
www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/ 
sustainable-fisheries/community-quota- 
and-license-programs-community- 
quota-entities. 
This information collection is 
required in Federal regulations at 50 
CFR 300 Subpart E and Part 679. The 
eligible communities and the 
community governing body that 
recommends the CQE are listed in Table 
21 to 50 CFR part 679. 
This collection contains applications 
used by a nonprofit corporation to 
become a CQE; by CQEs to receive non- 
trawl groundfish LLP licenses and 
Charter Halibut Permits (CHPs); by 
CQEs to transfer or receive IFQ QS; by 
CQEs to transfer IFQ to an eligible 
community resident or non-resident; 
and by CQEs to transfer between 
commercial halibut IFQ and halibut 
guided angler fish (GAF). In addition, 
this collection contains two reporting 
requirements: an annual report and an 
authorization letter. Annually each CQE 
must submit a report describing its 
business operations and fishing 
activities for each eligible community it 
represents. CQEs requesting LLP 
groundfish licenses must annually 
submit an authorization letter that 
assigns each community LLP license to 
a user and vessel. 
The type of information collected 
includes information on the applicants, 
transferors, transferees, authorized 
representatives, and communities 
represented, as well as information on 
the procedures, criteria, administrative 
activities, business operations, 
community fishing activities, sweep-up 
information, certificate and licensing 
information, and fishing activities 
pertaining to the application. 
NMFS requires this information for 
fisheries management and to evaluate 
the ability of a specific CQE to represent 
an eligible community. NMFS uses the 
information collected to establish 
eligibility of the CQEs; review each 
CQE’s business operations and fishing 
activity; monitor participation of the 
eligible communities in the CQE 
Program and associated limited access 
programs; and gather information on 
distribution and use among these 
communities of LLP groundfish 
licenses, CHPs, and halibut and 
sablefish QS and IFQ. 
All of the forms, except for the 
Application for Community Charter 
Halibut Permit at § 300.67(k), can now 
be submitted electronically via email. 
These forms will be updated 
accordingly to clarify that electronic 
submission is allowed.

Handling, Release, and Identification 
Workshops will be held in January, 
February, and March of 2026. Certain 
fishermen and shark dealers are 
required to attend a workshop to meet 
regulatory requirements and to maintain 
valid permits. Specifically, the Atlantic 
Shark Identification Workshop is 
mandatory for all federally permitted 
Atlantic shark dealers. The Safe 
Handling, Release, and Identification 
Workshop is mandatory for vessel 
owners and operators who use bottom 
longline, pelagic longline, or gillnet 
gear, and who have also been issued 
shark or swordfish limited access 
permits. Additional free workshops will 
be conducted in 2026 and will be 
announced in a future notice. In 
addition, NMFS has implemented 
online recertification workshops for 
persons who have already taken an in- 
person training. 
DATES: The Atlantic Shark Identification Workshops will be held on January 15, 
2026, February 19, 2026, and March 5, 
2026. The Safe Handling, Release, and 
Identification Workshops will be held 
on January 8, 2026, February 11, 2026, 
and March 17, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: The Atlantic Shark Identification Workshops will be held in 
Virginia Beach, VA, Melville, NY, and 
Wilmington, NC. The Safe Handling,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Atlantic highly migratory species (HMS) 
fisheries (swordfish, sharks, tunas, and 
billfish) are managed under the 2006 
Consolidated HMS Fishery Management 
Plan (FMP) and its amendments 
pursuant to the authority of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act 
(Magnuson-Stevens Act; 16 U.S.C. 1801 
et seq.) and consistent with the Atlantic 
Tunas Convention Act (16 U.S.C. 971 et 
seq.). HMS implementing regulations 
are at 50 CFR part 635. Section 635.8 
describes the requirements for the 
Atlantic Shark Identification Workshops 
and Safe Handling, Release, and 
Identification Workshops. The 
workshop schedules, registration 
information, and a list of frequently 
asked questions regarding the Atlantic 
Shark Identification and Safe Handling,

and-identification-workshops. 
Atlantic Shark Identification 
Workshops 
Since January 1, 2008, Atlantic shark 
dealers have been prohibited from 
receiving, purchasing, trading, or 
bartering for Atlantic sharks unless a 
valid Atlantic Shark Identification 
Workshop certificate is on the premises 
of each business listed under the shark 
dealer permit that first receives Atlantic 
sharks (71 FR 58057, October 2, 2006). 
Dealers who attend and successfully 
complete a workshop are issued a 
certificate for each place of business that 
is permitted to receive sharks. These 
certificate(s) are valid for 3 years. Thus, 
certificates that were initially issued in 
2023 will expire in 2026. 
Currently, permitted dealers may send 
a proxy to an Atlantic Shark 
Identification Workshop. However, if a 
dealer opts to send a proxy, the dealer 
must designate a proxy for each place of 
business covered by the dealer’s permit 
that first receives Atlantic sharks. Only 
one certificate will be issued to each 
proxy. A proxy must be a person who 
is currently employed by a place of 
business covered by the dealer’s permit; 
is a primary participant in the 
identification, weighing, and/or first 
receipt of fish as they are offloaded from 
a vessel; and who fills out dealer 
reports. Atlantic shark dealers are 
prohibited from renewing a Federal 
shark dealer permit unless a valid 
Atlantic Shark Identification Workshop 
certificate for each business location 
that first receives Atlantic sharks has 
been submitted with the permit renewal 
application. Additionally, a copy of a 
valid dealer or proxy Atlantic Shark 
Identification Workshop certificate must 
be in any trucks or other conveyances 
that are extensions of a dealer’s place of 
business.

Registration 
To register for a scheduled Atlantic 
Shark Identification Workshop, please 
contact Angler Conservation Education 
at 386–682–0158. Pre-registration is 
highly recommended, but not required. 
Registration Materials 
To ensure that workshop certificates 
are linked to the correct permits, 
participants will need to bring the 
following specific items to the 
workshop: 
1. Atlantic shark dealer permit 
holders must bring proof that the 
attendee is an owner or agent of the 
business (such as articles of 
incorporation), a copy of the applicable 
permit, and proof of identification. 
2. Atlantic shark dealer proxies must 
bring documentation from the permitted 
dealer acknowledging that the proxy is 
attending the workshop on behalf of the 
permitted Atlantic shark dealer for a 
specific business location, a copy of the 
appropriate valid permit, and proof of 
identification. 
Workshop Objectives 
The Atlantic Shark Identification 
Workshops are designed to reduce the 
number of unknown and improperly 
identified sharks reported in the dealer 
reporting form and increase the 
accuracy of species-specific dealer- 
reported information. Reducing the 
number of unknown and improperly 
identified sharks will improve quota 
monitoring and the data used in stock 
assessments. These workshops will train 
shark dealer permit holders or their 
proxies to properly identify Atlantic 
shark carcasses. 
Safe Handling, Release, and 
Identification Workshops 
Since January 1, 2007, shark limited 
access and swordfish limited access 
permit holders who fish with longline 
or gillnet gear have been required to 
submit a copy of their Safe Handling, 
Release, and Identification Workshop 
certificate in order to renew either 
permit (71 FR 58057, October 2, 2006). 
These certificate(s) are valid for 3 years. 
Certificates issued in 2023 will expire in 
2026. As such, vessel owners who have 
not already attended a workshop and 
received a NMFS certificate, or vessel 
owners whose certificate(s) will expire 
prior to the next permit renewal, must 
attend a workshop to fish with, or 
renew, their swordfish and shark 
limited access permits. Additionally, 
new shark and swordfish limited access 
permit applicants who intend to fish 
with longline or gillnet gear must attend 
a Safe Handling, Release, and 
Identification Workshop and submit a

longline or gillnet gear may not fish 
unless both the vessel owner and 
operator have valid workshop 
certificates on board at all times. Vessel 
operators who have not already

NMFS certificate, or vessel operators 
whose certificate(s) will expire prior to 
their next fishing trip, must attend a 
workshop to operate a vessel with 
swordfish and shark limited access 
permits on which longline or gillnet 
gear is used.

Registration 
To register for a scheduled Safe 
Handling, Release, and Identification 
Workshop, please contact Angler 
Conservation Education at 386–682– 
0158. Pre-registration is highly 
recommended, but not required. 
Registration Materials 
To ensure that workshop certificates 
are linked to the correct permits, 
participants will need to bring the 
following specific items with them to 
the workshop: 
1. Individual vessel owners must 
bring a copy of the appropriate 
swordfish and/or shark permit(s), a copy 
of the vessel registration or 
documentation, and proof of 
identification. 
2. Representatives of a business- 
owned or co-owned vessel must bring 
proof that the individual is an agent of 
the business (such as articles of 
incorporation), a copy of the applicable 
swordfish and/or shark permit(s), and 
proof of identification. 
3. Vessel operators must bring proof 
of identification. 
Workshop Objectives 
The Safe Handling, Release, and 
Identification Workshops are designed 
to teach the owner and operator of a 
vessel that fishes with longline or gillnet 
gear the required techniques for the safe 
handling and release of entangled and/ 
or hooked protected species, such as sea 
turtles, marine mammals, smalltooth 
sawfish, Atlantic sturgeon, and 
prohibited sharks. In an effort to 
improve reporting, the proper 
identification of protected species and 
prohibited sharks will also be taught at 
these workshops. Additionally, 
individuals attending these workshops 
will gain a better understanding of the 
requirements for participating in these 
fisheries. The overall goal of these 
workshops is to provide participants 
with the skills needed to reduce the 
mortality of protected species and 
prohibited sharks, which may prevent 
additional regulations on these fisheries 
in the future. 
Online Recertification Workshops 
NMFS implemented an online option 
for shark dealers and owners and 
operators of vessels that fish with 
longline and gillnet gear to renew their 
certificates in December 2021. To be 
eligible for online recertification 
workshops, dealers and vessel owners 
and operators need to have previously 
attended an in-person workshop. 
Information about the courses is 
available online at https://

Truth in Lending (Regulation Z); Non- 
application to Earned Wage Access 
Products 
AGENCY: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
ACTION: Advisory opinion. SUMMARY: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is issuing this 
advisory opinion to resolve regulatory 
uncertainty regarding: (1) the 
applicability of the definition of credit 
under Regulation Z, which implements 
the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), to 
earned wage access (EWA) products that 
conform to the description of ‘‘Covered 
EWA’’ provided in part I.C.2 of this 
advisory opinion; and (2) the 
applicability of the definition of finance 
charge under Regulation Z to certain 
EWA-related charges (expedited 
delivery fees, tips) to the extent any 
EWA products meet the Regulation Z 
definition of credit. The CFPB is also 
withdrawing a proposed interpretive 
rule. 
DATES: This advisory opinion is effective on December 23, 2025.

I. Advisory Opinion 
A. Market Background 
According to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, nearly three-quarters of U.S. 
private businesses use biweekly, 
semimonthly, or monthly pay periods.
2
 
Several obstacles continue to prevent 
businesses from readily implementing 
shorter pay cycles.
3
Starting a little over 
a decade ago, earned wage access (EWA) 
has emerged as an innovative way for 
workers to meet short-term liquidity 
needs that arise between paychecks 
without turning to potentially more 
costly alternatives. EWA seeks to 
address the lag between consumers’ 
hours worked and receipt of their

In some cases, deductions may include fees or 
other consumer payments associated with an EWA 
transaction. 
5
For example, some EP providers instruct the 
payroll processor to divert a portion of the 
paycheck to the EP provider, with the remainder 
going straight to the worker. Others instruct the 
payroll processor to pay the entire paycheck to the 
EP provider, which then makes the relevant 
residual payment to the worker. Whatever the exact 
model of payroll process deduction used, EP 
providers generally do not take funds from the 
worker’s regular transaction account after that 
account’s receipt of wages; instead, they make use 
of the payroll process to facilitate deduction. 
6
This includes, without limitation, prepaid and 
payroll card accounts. In some cases, the provider 
may partner with a bank to provide its EWA 
customers with a payroll card or other transaction 
account that the worker then uses to receive both 
early wage access and their regular paycheck. 
7
For example, at least one D2C provider obtains 
consumer authorization to instruct payroll 
processors to divert a portion of the paycheck to a 
dedicated account opened ‘‘for the benefit’’ of the 
consumer, which is used solely for the purpose of 
enabling the D2C provider to obtain payment, with 
the remainder of the paycheck going straight to the 
consumer’s regular transaction account.

17
The definition of ‘‘credit’’ in TILA is virtually 
identical to Regulation Z’s definition of the term. 
See 15 U.S.C. 1602(f). Accordingly, the 2020 AO also stated that Covered EWA does not involve the 
offering or extension of ‘‘credit’’ under TILA. 
18
See 2020 AO, 85 FR 79404 at 79405–06. 19
The 2020 AO invited providers of EWA 
programs that charge fees to request clarification 
from the CFPB about their programs through, for 
example, applying for a compliance assistance 
sandbox (CAS) approval. See 2020 AO, 85 FR 79404 at 79405 (citing the CAS policy published at 84 FR 
48246 (Sept. 13, 2019)). In December 2020, the 
CFPB granted one such application from Payactiv, 
stating that its EWA product—which charged a $1 
daily access fee for EWA—was not credit. See 
Approval Order (Dec. 30, 2020), https://files.
consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_payactiv_approval-order_2020-12.pdf. That approval was rescinded in June 2022.

paychecks by facilitating advance access 
to earned but as yet unpaid wages. 
Two main types of EWA exist in the 
market today. Providers of ‘‘employer- 
partnered’’ (EP) EWA contract with 
employers to offer their workers access 
to amounts not exceeding accrued 
wages, with the provider generally 
utilizing the payroll process to deduct 
accessed amounts at the next payroll 
event.
4
EP providers have evolved a 
variety of methods for making payroll 
process deductions.
5
In addition, EP 
providers generally claim no rights 
against the worker in the event that the 
next paycheck is insufficient to support 
the deduction. ‘‘Direct-to-consumer’’ 
(D2C) EWA providers offer access to 
amounts that they estimate to be below 
accrued wages, with the provider then 
generally debiting accessed amounts via 
automated withdrawal from the 
worker’s regular transaction account 
that receives their paycheck.
6
Some D2C 
providers claim rights against the 
worker in the event that the amount that 
they are able to withdraw is insufficient. 
Some of the significant differences 
between these two types of earned wage 
products, however, are starting to erode. 
Some D2C providers now obtain payroll 
records to determine accrued wages, 
rather than estimate accrued wages by 
less direct means. Some also make 
deductions using the payroll process, 
rather than transferring from the 
consumer’s regular transaction account 
after the consumer is paid.
7
In addition, 
some D2C providers limit their ability to 
seek recourse. 
Both forms of EWA now exist at scale, 
reflecting significant consumer demand, 
dozens of EWA providers, and upwards 
of $3.5 billion investment in the market 
from venture capital firms over the past 
decade.
8
A 2024 report from the CFPB 
estimated that the EP EWA market had 
grown from $3.2 billion across 18.6 
million transactions in 2018 to $22.8 
billion across 214 million transactions 
in 2022, with 7.2 million workers 
utilizing EP EWA transactions at least 
once.
9
That same year, an estimated 3 
million workers accessed roughly $9.1 
billion in D2C EWA funds; market 
analyses indicate that use of D2C 
products has also grown significantly 
over recent years.
10
Recent estimates 
project that the U.S. EWA market is set 
to expand by about 300 percent between 
2024 and 2034.
11
 
EP providers obtain revenue from one 
or more of several sources: direct 
payment from the employer; a share of 
interchange revenue from payment 
cards used by workers; fees paid by 
workers for expedited delivery of EWA 
funds; and, less frequently, from 
subscription charges for access to EWA, 
sometimes packaged with other 
employee benefits. D2C providers obtain 
revenue from one or more of some of 
these same sources as well: interchange 
revenue, expedited delivery fees, and 
subscription charges. Many D2C 
providers also solicit tips from the 
workers who use their products.
12
 
B. Regulatory Background 
In November 2020, the CFPB issued 
an advisory opinion (the 2020 AO)
13
to 
respond to uncertainty about whether 
EWA providers offer or extend ‘‘credit’’ 
within the scope of the Truth in 
Lending Act (TILA) and its 
implementing Regulation Z.
14
The 2020 
AO noted that the CFPB had itself 
acknowledged some uncertainty on this 
point when it issued the 2017 Payday 
Rule.
15
The 2020 AO was issued 
pursuant to the CFPB’s Advisory 
Opinions Policy, which is ‘‘intended to 
facilitate timely guidance by the Bureau 
that enables compliance by resolving 
outstanding regulatory uncertainty.’’
16
 
The 2020 AO clarified that a 
particular type of EWA—which it 
labeled as a ‘‘Covered EWA Program’’— 
did not involve the offering or extension 
of ‘‘credit’’ as defined by section 
1026.2(a)(14) of Regulation Z.
17
As 
described further in the 2020 AO, a 
Covered EWA Program met all of the 
following criteria
18
: it is employer- 
partnered; the amount accessed by the 
employee does not exceed accrued 
wages; accessing EWA is free for the 
employee; the provider has no recourse 
against the employee if an employer- 
facilitated deduction from the next 
paycheck is insufficient, and engages in 
no debt collection or credit reporting 
activity; and the provider does not 
assess the credit risk of employees. The 
2020 AO noted that Covered EWA 
Programs, being functionally equivalent 
to early wage payment, do not involve 
debt and, by extension, credit under 
Regulation Z. The 2020 AO did not state 
that other forms of EWA, such as direct- 
to-consumer EWA, are credit under Regulation Z. It did not reach that 
question, although it observed that EWA 
meeting all the listed criteria except 
being free to the consumer might not be 
credit under Regulation Z.
19
 
On January 15, 2025, the CFPB issued 
another advisory opinion rescinding the 
2020 AO (the 2025 Rescission).
20
The 
2025 Rescission contended that the 
2020 AO created, rather than reduced, 
regulatory uncertainty. It further 
claimed that the 2020 AO contained 
several legal flaws. Prior to the 2025 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:11 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\23DEN1.SGM 23DEN1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60071 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Notices 21
See 2024 PIR, 89 FR 61358 (July 31, 2024). 22
In response to the 2024 PIR, the CFPB received 
37 comments from industry stakeholders; 15 
comments from consumer group stakeholders; 10 
comments from Federal, State, and local 
government officials; and nearly 150,000 comments 
from individual consumers. In part because of the 
many comments received on the 2024 PIR, the 
CFPB is not seeking comment on this advisory 
opinion. 
23
The unfinalized and abandoned 2024 PIR is of 
no legal effect. However, the CFPB is hereby 
formally withdrawing the 2024 PIR for several 
reasons, including: the comments received on it; a 
number of Executive Orders, including E.O. 14219; 
and at least five Federal district court opinions, 
directly or indirectly, relying heavily on it. See 
cases cited in infra note 81. 24
90 FR 20084 (May 12, 2025). 
25
The ‘‘accrued cash value of the wages’’ are 
wages that the worker is entitled to receive under 
State law in the event of separation from the 
employer for work performed for the employer, but 
for which the worker has yet to be paid. 
26
‘‘Payroll data’’ are generally maintained by a 
payroll processor engaged by the employer to 
handle payroll; in some cases, however, the 
employer may handle payroll in-house and would 
be the source for payroll data. 
27
Providers should take note of the possibility 
that workers could take two or more EWA 
transactions, potentially from different providers, in 
the same pay period, and that these transactions 
could cumulatively exceed the accrued cash value of the worker’s wages, even as each individual EWA 
transaction does not. A transaction that causes the 
cumulative amount to exceed the accrued cash 
value of the worker’s wages is not a Covered EWA 
transaction; earlier EWA transactions may be. To 
meet this first criteria, therefore, providers may 
need to account for any earlier Covered EWA 
transactions in that same pay period. 
28
In the event of a technical or administrative 
error, Covered EWA encompasses one additional 
payroll process deduction at the next payroll event. Technical or administrative errors include, for 
instance, an API malfunction or a mistake in the 
employer’s payroll process (e.g., miscalculation of a worker’s base pay or overtime award). They do 
not include situations in which the employer has 
withheld a worker’s garnished wages following a 
Covered EWA transaction. For example, a Covered 
EWA transaction may occur in week one of a 
worker’s pay cycle, but the employer learns of and 
subjects the worker’s paycheck to a required wage 
garnishment in week two of the pay cycle. As a 
result of the garnishment, the worker’s paycheck is 
less than the amount of the Covered EWA 
transaction. That is not administrative or technical 
error of the kind identified in part I.C.2.a.(2). 
29
Examples of payroll process deduction include, 
without limitation: (a) the payroll processor sends 
the relevant amount to the EWA provider, and pays 
the remaining wages to the worker’s regular 
transaction account; (b) the payroll processor sends 
the relevant amount to an account held ‘‘for the 
benefit’’ of the consumer and used only to make 
payments to the EWA provider, and the processor 
pays the remaining wages to the worker’s regular 
transaction account; and (c) the payroll processor 
sends all wages to the EWA provider, with the EWA 
provider separately and directly paying the balance 
of the wages owed to the worker’s regular 
transaction account. Providers seeking clarification 
from the CFPB about whether their practices 
constitute payroll process deduction may request 
clarification from the CFPB by, for instance, 
applying for an Approval under the Policy on the 
Compliance Assistance Sandbox. See 84 FR 48246. Although the policy was rescinded in September 
2022, the CFPB anticipates reissuing it shortly after 
this advisory opinion is published. 
30
As noted, a regular transaction account may 
include payroll or prepaid card accounts offered to 
the consumer by the EWA provider in partnership 
with a bank issuer. See supra note 6. 
31
A provider may choose to refrain from offering 
the worker further EWA services and still meet this 
condition. 
32
12 CFR 1026.2(a)(14). TILA defines ‘‘credit’’ as 
‘‘the right granted by a creditor to a debtor to defer 
payment of debt or to incur debt and defer its 
payment.’’ 15 U.S.C. 1602(f). 
33
See 2020 AO, 85 FR 79404 at 79406–07. 34
Debt, Black’s Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1968). 35
See 2020 AO, 85 FR 79404 at 79406. Citing a later Black’s definition of debt, the 2020 AO notes 
Continued 
Rescission, the CFPB considered 
replacing the 2020 AO with a contrary 
opinion. Specifically, in June 2024, the 
CFPB issued a proposed interpretive 
rule (the 2024 PIR) that, if finalized, 
would have identified all EWA as Regulation Z credit.
21
In addition, the 
2024 PIR would have identified 
expedited delivery fees and, at least in 
certain circumstances, tips as finance 
charges under Regulation Z. After 
soliciting public comment
22
on the 
2024 PIR, the CFPB never adopted the 
interpretive positions proposed in it, 
opting instead for the much narrower 
rescission of the 2020 AO.
23
Finally, in 
May 2025, the CFPB withdrew both the 
2020 AO and the 2025 Rescission.
24
 
C. Legal Analysis 
1. General 
Part I.C.2 of this advisory opinion 
explains why Covered EWA is not credit 
under Regulation Z. Part I.C.3 explains 
why, to the extent that any EWA 
product is Regulation Z credit, 
expedited delivery fees and tips are not, 
in the normal course, finance charges 
under Regulation Z. 
This advisory opinion does not state, 
and nothing in it should be understood 
to state, that EWA products that are not 
Covered EWA are credit under Regulation Z. In addition, nothing in 
this advisory opinion interprets 
provisions of law outside of Regulation 
Z. The CFPB continues to seek 
stakeholder feedback and evaluate 
whether it should take further legal 
steps with respect to EWA products, 
including steps that might encompass 
non-Covered EWA and/or other 
provisions of law besides Regulation Z. 
2. Covered EWA Is Not Credit 
a. Covered EWA 
For purposes of this advisory opinion, 
the term ‘‘Covered EWA’’ means EWA 
that includes all of the following 
characteristics: 
(1) Covered EWA transactions do not 
exceed the accrued cash value of the 
wages
25
the worker has earned up to the 
date and time of the transaction, which 
amount is determined based upon 
payroll data
26
that evidence this 
amount.
27
A Covered EWA provider 
does not determine accrued wages based 
on other information, such as worker 
representations, or on estimates or 
predictions of accrued wages. 
(2) The provider uses a payroll 
process deduction in connection with 
the worker’s next payroll event.
28
In a 
payroll process deduction, payment 
instructions received and acted upon by 
the payroll processor (or by the 
employer itself if it does not use a 
processor) enable the EWA provider to 
receive accessed amounts without 
debiting the consumer’s regular 
transaction account after the consumer 
is paid.
29
A transfer to the provider from 
any of the consumer’s regular 
transaction accounts after the payment 
of wages into that account is not a 
payroll process deduction.
30
 
(3) Before providing Covered EWA, 
the provider clearly and conspicuously 
explains to the worker, and warrants to 
the worker as part of the contract 
between the parties, that it: (a) has no 
legal or contractual claim or remedy, 
direct or indirect, against the worker in 
the event the payroll process deduction 
is insufficient to cover the full amount 
of a Covered EWA transaction, 
including no right to take payment from 
any of the consumer’s regular 
transaction accounts;
31
and (b) will not 
engage in any debt collection activities 
related to Covered EWA, place a 
Covered EWA transaction amount as a 
debt with or sell it to a third party, or 
report to a consumer reporting agency 
concerning Covered EWA. 
(4) The provider does not directly or 
indirectly assess the credit risk of 
individual workers, including through 
obtaining and reviewing credit reports 
or credit scores about the individual 
workers. 
b. Analysis 
Section 1026.2(a)(14) of Regulation Z 
defines ‘‘credit’’ as ‘‘the right to defer 
payment of debt or to incur debt and 
defer its payment.’’
32
Neither 
Regulation Z nor TILA define the term 
‘‘debt.’’ Covered EWA does not provide 
workers with the right to defer payment 
of debt or to incur debt and defer its 
payment. As a result, Covered EWA is 
not credit. 
As explained further in the 2020 AO, 
this is for several reasons.
33
The primary 
reason is that the common meaning of 
debt is ‘‘a sum of money due by certain 
and express agreement’’ or ‘‘a financial 
liability or obligation owed by one 
person, the debtor, to another, the 
creditor.’’
34
In the context of Covered 
EWA, the worker incurs no such 
liability or obligation.
35
Covered EWA

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60072 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Notices the absence of a ‘‘liability’’ in this context. 
However, the 2020 AO did not intend to 
differentiate ‘‘liability’’ from ‘‘obligation’’ in this 
context. The present AO relies on the 1968 Black’s 
definition of debt, which was current when TILA 
became law, and which also draws no such 
distinction. 
36
Covered EWA transactions cannot be more than 
this amount, which reduces the risk that EWA 
funds do not correspond to funds the worker has 
actually earned and is entitled to receive on payday. 
37
Payroll process deductions may not be 
attempted in any other pay period in the event that 
the initial payroll process deduction is insufficient 
to cover the full amount of the Covered EWA 
transaction. However, in the event of a technical or 
administrative error, one additional payroll process 
deduction may be attempted at the next payroll 
event. 
38
In proposing an interpretation of credit that 
would cover all EWA, the 2024 PIR noted that ‘‘it 
is not uncommon for credit providers to compel 
repayment of debt using wage garnishment 
automatically deducted from consumer paychecks.’’ 
2024 PIR, 89 FR 61358, 61361 n.26 (July 31, 2024). 
But the fact that some creditors sometimes obtain 
repayment of debts via payroll does not 
demonstrate that all payroll process deductions 
involve the repayment of debt. None of the 
examples cited in the 2024 PIR involve deductions 
to account for the consumer earlier accessing 
money that they were owed by virtue of work that 
they had already performed.

regulatory definition [of ‘credit’] may be difficult to 
apply in particular fact situations, and the Board 
therefore offers the following guidance, which will 
also be incorporated into the commentary.’’). In a 
footnote, the 2024 PIR asserts without support that 
because this exclusion was promulgated after notice 
and comment, products that are similar but not 
specifically covered by it ‘‘should therefore be 
presumed to be ‘credit.’’’ See 2024 PIR, 89 FR 61358 at 61361 n.29. The 2024 PIR offers no citation or 
basis for this position. In fact, statements by the 
Board directly contradict that approach and instead 
explain that Regulation Z commentary is intended 
to serve as guidance for use in determining 
application to particular transactions. See, e.g., 46 
FR 28560, 28560 (May 27, 1981) (proposing official 
Regulation Z commentary); 46 FR 50288, 50288

42
This could happen, for instance, if a worker’s 
wages become subject to garnishment or an 
employer goes out of business after an EWA 
transaction but before the scheduled payday.

82 FR 54472 at 54547. 
44
See 2020 AO, 85 FR 79404 at 79407. As the 2020 AO noted, courts generally look at the totality 
of the circumstances—and weigh multiple factors in 
a fact-specific inquiry—to determine if a 
transaction’s substance is credit. See id. (citing 
cases at note 20). 
facilitates workers’ access to wage 
amounts that they have already earned, 
and to which they are already entitled.
36
 
Using payroll data, either at the 
employer or its payroll processor, the 
provider knows the accrued cash value 
of the worker’s wages at the point that 
the worker requests a Covered EWA 
transaction. Using the payroll process, 
the provider makes a deduction for the 
amount of the Covered EWA transaction 
at the next scheduled payroll event, 
which corresponds to the pay period in 
which the worker accrued the wages on 
which the Covered EWA was based.
37
 
Covered EWA offers workers access to 
money that they are owed by virtue of 
work that they have already performed. 
Rather than the consumer’s repayment 
of a debt, the provider’s payroll process 
deduction from the payroll event 
associated with that work serves to 
ensure the consumer is not effectively 
compensated twice for the same work.
38
 
They have had earlier-than-normal 
access to wage amounts accrued, so they 
are owed less at payday. 
Fundamentally, Covered EWA 
resembles early wage payment and does 
not resemble an extension of credit. 
The 2020 AO also drew support from 
two prior regulatory statements.
39
 
Comment 2(a)(14)-1.v to Regulation Z 
states that ‘‘[b]orrowing against the 
accrued cash value of an insurance 
policy or a pension account if there is 
no independent obligation to repay’’ is 
‘‘not considered credit for purposes of 
the regulation.’’
40
When it issued this 
Regulation Z commentary, the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System (the Board) stated that in such 
instances, ‘‘credit has not been extended 
because the consumer is, in effect, only 
using the consumer’s own money.’’
41
 
As the 2020 AO explains, the accrued 
cash value of a worker’s earned but 
unpaid wages is similarly the worker’s 
own money. Accordingly, in a Covered 
EWA transaction, the worker is ‘‘in 
effect, only using the [worker’s] own 
money’’ and is not incurring debt or 
deferring its payment. Similarly, 
Covered EWA involves ‘‘no 
independent obligation to repay’’ 
because the provider may only transfer 
funds via the allowed payroll process 
deduction for the pay period in which 
the wages were accrued; it has no claim 
direct or indirect against a worker for 
nonpayment in the event of a failed or 
partial deduction.
42
The 2020 AO also 
cited the preamble to the 2017 Payday 
Rule in support of its interpretation of 
the application of § 1026.2(a)(14) to 
Covered EWA Programs. Recognizing 
that ‘‘some efforts to give consumers 
access to accrued wages may not be 
credit at all,’’ that rule took specific 
steps to ensure that it had no 
application to several types of EWA 
products.
43
 
Finally, the 2020 AO noted that 
Covered EWA Programs lack typical 
substantive indicia of credit.
44
Covered 
EWA providers similarly reserve no 
recourse against the worker in the event 
a payroll process deduction for the 
period in which accessed wage amounts 
were accrued is insufficient to cover 
those amounts. A Covered EWA 
provider also cannot engage in debt 
collection, report to consumer reporting 
agencies, or sell or place the transaction 
as a debt with any third party. Providers 
also do not pull credit reports or credit 
scores on individual workers or 
otherwise assess their credit risk. 
The 2020 AO limited its application 
to EP EWA, and more specifically to EP 
products where the provider transfers 
the amount of each EWA transaction 
‘‘through an employer-facilitated payroll 
deduction from the employee’s next 
paycheck.’’ Upon reconsideration, 
however, the CFPB now believes that 
these specific limitations are not 
derived from the text of Regulation Z (or 
TILA). Section 1026.2(a)(14) of 
Regulation Z defines ‘‘credit’’ as ‘‘the 
right to defer payment of debt or to 
incur debt and defer its payment’’; 
pursuant to this definition, the defining 
element of ‘‘credit’’ is a consumer’s 
repayment—at some point in the 
future—of the amount owed. When an 
EWA provider makes arrangements to 
ensure that the appropriate amount of 
the consumer’s paycheck is directed to 
it through a payroll process deduction, 
the funds never touch the consumer’s 
regular transaction account, and 
accordingly the consumer makes no 
deferred payment. 
Indeed, as noted above, the EWA 
market has evolved such that EP 
providers now use a variety of methods 
for effecting transfers through the 
payroll process, which include, but are 
no longer limited to, ‘‘employer- 
facilitated payroll deductions.’’ For 
purposes of interpreting the application 
of ‘‘credit’’ to EWA, there is no reason 
to preference one such method over 
others. Similarly, D2C providers that 
transfer EWA amounts through the 
payroll process, rather than from a 
worker’s regular transaction account 
after receipt of wages, are Covered EWA 
if they meet the other criteria. 
The 2020 AO also limited its 
application to EWA products that were 
free to the consumer. That limitation, 
too, is not required by the text of 
Regulation Z (or TILA) and is not 
maintained in the present advisory 
opinion. Under existing law, consumer 
cost is relevant to the question of 
whether consumers incur Regulation Z 
finance charges in connection with 
products that extend credit—but has no 
bearing on whether or not a product 
amounts to Regulation Z credit in the 
first place. As noted, whether a product 
constitutes credit depends on whether it 
implicates a debt. For the reasons 
explained above, Covered EWA does 
not. Credit can be free to the consumer 
or it can cost the consumer. Non-credit 
products, too, can be free or they can

The 2020 AO noted that both wages and free 
EWA cost the consumer nothing, but that 
observation was not central to its core claim that the 
consumer does not incur a liability when using 
EWA. The 2020 AO focused on a class of EWA 
products that is the most akin to early wage 
payment—because wages are free to the consumer. 
But that does not mean that other forms of EWA— 
including Covered EWA as defined in this advisory 
opinion—are not more akin to early wage payment 
than to credit extension. 
48
A provider is a creditor under Regulation Z if 
the product is repayable in more than four 
installments or subject to finance charges. 12 CFR 
1026.2(a)(17)(i). In the normal course, free EWA 
products will not meet either condition and thus 
their providers will not be Regulation Z creditors. 
Regulation Z also includes definitions of ‘‘creditor’’ 
that apply specifically to credit card issuers. See 12 CFR 1026(a)(17)(iii), (iv). The CFPB is unaware of 
any EWA providers that issue credit cards in 
connection with the provision of EWA. 
49
Regulation Z provides that undefined terms 
‘‘have the meanings given to them by state law or 
contract’’ (12 CFR 1026.2(b)(3)), but the regulation 
offers no guidance about how to apply this 
provision, and there is little applicable case law. 
Some cases have interpreted the provision as an 
instruction to consult the ‘‘ordinary usage’’ of the 
undefined term in question. See, e.g., Fernandes v. 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 818 F. Supp. 2d 1086, 
1090–91 (N.D. Ill. 2011) (consulting Black’s Law 
Dictionary for the meaning of the undefined term 
in question); Wilbourn v. Advantage Fin. Partners, 2010 WL 1194950, at *6 (N.D. Ill. 2010). This 
advisory opinion, like the 2020 AO, relies on 
exactly this kind of ordinary usage of the term 
‘‘debt.’’ 
50
See, e.g., Kan. Stat. Ann. § 9–2407(a)(1) 
(‘‘Earned wage access services provided by a 
registrant in accordance with this chapter shall not 
be considered to be: (A) A loan or other form of 
credit or the registrant a creditor or lender with 
respect thereto’’); Mo. Ann. Stat. § 361.749(6)(1) 
(‘‘Earned wage access services offered and provided 
by a registered provider shall not be considered to 
be any of the following: . . . (b) A loan or other 
form of credit’’); S.C. Code Ann. § 39–5–860 
(‘‘Proceeds provided to a consumer by the [EWA] 
provider shall not be considered a consumer loan 
for purposes of Section 37–3–104 [defining 
consumer loan] or a loan for purposes of Section 
37–3–106 [defining loan].’’); Utah Code Ann. § 13– 
78–106(1) (‘‘A provider offering or providing earned 
wage access services in this state: . . . (b) is not 
offering a loan or other form of credit or debt, if the 
provider is not a creditor, a debt collector, or a 
lender.’’). The 2024 PIR cites State law definitions 
of ‘‘debt’’ (many of which happen to appear in State 
FDCPA statutes) that it claims support its broad 
‘‘any obligation’’ interpretation of ‘‘debt,’’ but it 
avoids discussing State law’s treatment of whether 
EWA is credit, which predominantly supports the 
interpretation offered here and in the 2020 AO.

See 2025 Rescission, 90 FR 3622, 3623 (Jan. 15, 2025). As part of this criticism, the 2025 Rescission 
faulted the 2020 AO for failing to ‘‘explain how its 
‘totality of the circumstances’ approach derived 
from the definition of ‘credit.’ ’’ Id. But as the 2020 AO explained, courts commonly conduct a fact- 
specific inquiry—using the types of factors 
articulated in the 2020 AO—to determine whether 
a transaction is ‘‘credit.’’ The logic of the 2025 
Rescission would prohibit an agency from 
interpreting terms using well-established precedent. 
cost. The difference between the two is 
not cost. 
Not only is this point clear from 
looking at the text of the statute and 
regulation, but it is a point of wide 
interpretive consensus, as demonstrated 
by stakeholder feedback on the 2020 
AO. For example, in an October 12, 
2021 letter, some 96 consumer, labor, 
civil rights, legal services, faith, 
community and financial organizations, 
and academics state that the 2020 AO 
was flawed in part because ‘‘the 
definition of ‘credit’ under TILA is not 
related to price.’’
45
A contemporaneous 
letter from the National Consumer Law 
Center and the Center for Responsible 
Lending expands on the point: 
‘‘Whether there is a charge for credit has 
absolutely no bearing on whether ‘debt’ 
has been incurred. The cost is only 
relevant to whether the lender is a 
‘creditor’: one who ‘regularly extends 
consumer credit that is subject to a 
finance charge or is payable by written 
agreement in more than four 
installments.’’’
46
Moreover, the 2020 
AO did not position cost as critical to 
its interpretation. Rather, it simply 
limited its interpretive scope to 
products that were free.
47
 
It is important to note that obligations 
under Regulation Z and TILA generally 
only arise when a provider is a 
Regulation Z creditor. Regardless of 
whether a product counts as Regulation 
Z credit, if its provider is not a 
Regulation Z creditor, then as a general 
matter, the product is not subject to 
regulatory obligations under Regulation 
Z or TILA. And cost is relevant to the question of whether or not a provider is 
a creditor, as discussed in part I.C.3 
below. In the normal course, providers 
of EWA products that are free and thus 
carry no finance charges will not be 
creditors under Regulation Z, and 
accordingly such EWA products will 
not be subject to credit regulation under 
Regulation Z.
48
 
While the 2025 Rescission took no 
position on whether Regulation Z 
applies to any forms of EWA, it 
criticized the reasoning of the 2020 AO 
in four respects. Upon reconsideration, 
the CFPB now believes that none of 
these criticisms are persuasive. First, it 
faulted the 2020 AO for not drawing on 
State law definitions of debt, even as it 
did not claim that CFPB interpretations 
of Regulation Z debt must rely on State law.
49
However, the 2020 AO, like this 
advisory opinion, relied on the ordinary 
meaning of the term ‘‘debt,’’ which is 
found in numerous State laws. In 
addition, most States to have 
specifically considered EWA 
legislatively do not regulate EWA as 
credit.
50
And two States offering 
regulatory guidance on EWA 
determined that it does not count as a 
loan under State law.
51
 
Second, the 2025 Rescission targeted 
what it characterized as the main 
rationale for the 2020 AO’s assertion 
that Covered EWA Programs do not 
involve the consumer incurring a 
liability: the claim that EWA 
‘‘functionally operates like’’ an 
employer that pays its workers earlier 
than the scheduled payday. The 2025 
Rescission took issue with this rationale 
for insufficiently explaining why 
‘‘functional operation’’ supports the 
2020 AO’s conclusion. The point 
intended by that language is the same 
point made above: for all the reasons 
stated in the 2020 AO and restated here, 
EWA resembles the early payment of 
wages and does not resemble the 
extension of credit. With Covered EWA, 
there is no liability or obligation 
sufficient to create a debt because the 
provider, by engaging with the 
consumer’s employer or its payroll 
processor, makes a payroll process 
deduction for the pay period in which 
the wages have been accrued, and 
reserves no recourse against the 
consumer if that deduction falls short of 
the amount of the EWA transaction— 
just as an employer directly advancing 
wages to a worker would use the payroll 
process to deduct that amount from the 
worker’s paycheck and take no further 
recourse against the worker. The 
deduction operates to ensure that the 
consumer is not effectively paid twice 
for the same work. The presence of a 
third-party intermediary—the EWA 
provider—facilitating access to accrued 
earnings does not change the nature of 
the transaction. 
Third, while the 2025 Rescission did 
not dispute that Covered EWA lacks 
certain significant indicia that are 
common in credit transactions (such as 
underwriting, debt collection, recourse, 
credit reporting, and so on), it asserted 
that the 2020 AO failed to consider 
EWA features ‘‘commonly found in 
credit transactions, including a 
consumer’s receipt of funds, consumer 
repayment of those funds, and the wage 
garnishment tool used to effectuate 
repayment.’’
52

To the extent the 2025 Rescission contended 
that the Payday Rule’s exclusion of certain ‘‘wage advance products’’ demonstrates that such products 
must be Regulation Z credit (because the rule only 
applies to such credit), that contention is false. The 
Payday Rule made clear that its wage advance 
exclusion was limited to ‘‘advances that constitute 
credit,’’ indicating that some such advances might 
not in fact be credit for the various reasons that it noted, including that EWA lets consumers ‘‘draw 
on the accrued cash value of wages they have 
earned but not yet been paid,’’ and does so 
‘‘without recourse beyond deduction from the next 
paycheck,’’ and without ‘‘collection or debt 
reporting activities.’’ 82 FR 54472 at 54547 
(emphasis added). 
54
The 2024 PIR contends that because the Payday 
Rule’s exclusions for ‘‘wage advance products’’ only 
operate to the extent that such products are TILA 
credit, ‘‘the decision to exclude’’ such products 
‘‘has no impact on the credit status of EWA 
products under TILA or Regulation Z.’’ What this 
misses is that the CFPB was clear that it was 
providing these exclusions precisely because it 
recognized that such products might not be TILA 
credit. Absent a final determination of EWA’s credit 
status, the CFPB needed to provide the exclusions 
to ensure that the Payday Rule would not apply to 
these products. 
55
This advisory opinion does not address the 
question of whether EWA subscription fees are 
finance charges because Regulation Z already 
clarifies that this type of ‘‘participation’’ fee is not 
a finance charge. See 12 CFR 1026.4(c)(4). 56

Regulation Z provides that undefined terms

about how to apply this provision.

Nor does case law clarify their meaning. A good 
example is Household Credit Servs., Inc. v. Pfennig, 541 U.S. 232 (2004). In Pfennig, the Supreme Court overturned the Sixth Circuit’s determination that a 
credit card over-limit fee was a finance charge, in 
part, on the ground that ‘‘the phrase ‘incident to’ 
does not make clear whether a substantial (as 
opposed to remote) connection is required.’’ Id. at 241. As such, it is not possible ‘‘to conclude that 
the term ‘finance charge’ unambiguously includes 
over-limit fees.’’ Id. Thus, the opinion provides little if any assistance in determining whether 
expedited delivery fees and tips associated with 
EWA are finance charges. The 2024 PIR implausibly 
interpreted Pfennig to hold that only a remote connection is required and then used this 
interpretation to buttress the view that expedited 
delivery fees and tips are ‘‘incident to’’ the 
provision of EWA. 
65
61 FR 49237, 49239 (Sept. 19, 1996) (‘‘The 
Board has generally taken a case-by-case approach 
in determining whether particular fees are ‘finance 
charges.’ ’’). 
believe those factors are necessary to the 
analysis, but considering them further, 
it does not believe they would require 
a different result. Receipt of funds is 
common to many kinds of 
transactions—a sale or investment, for 
example, not to mention receipt of 
wages directly from an employer—and 
thus is not a meaningful indicium of 
credit. Further, covered EWA products 
do not garnish wages, and they do not 
involve consumer repayment. As noted 
above, the payroll process deduction 
that the EWA provider uses at the next 
payroll event works to ensure that the 
consumer is not effectively paid twice 
for the same work—and accordingly is 
not consumer repayment for credit 
advanced. 
Fourth, the 2025 Rescission criticized 
the 2020 AO for drawing support from 
the 2017 Payday Rule’s exclusion of 
certain EWA products. It suggested that 
these exclusions have no bearing on the 
Regulation Z credit status of EWA 
because the Payday Rule was based on 
the CFPB’s UDAAP authority, not its 
TILA authority, and the exclusions 
would only operate to the extent that 
EWA was credit under Regulation Z. It 
is true that the 2017 Payday Rule did 
not conclusively determine that EWA 
was not Regulation Z credit. But when 
it considered and then finalized the 
Payday Rule, the CFPB recognized that 
EWA products might well not be credit. 
As a result, it took formal regulatory 
steps to ensure that the Payday Rule’s 
regulation of short-term credit would 
not have application to EWA.
53
Upon 
reconsideration, the CFPB now believes 
that it was appropriate for the 2020 AO 
to cite this recognition as additional 
support for its conclusion.
54
 
3. Expedited Delivery Fees and Tips 
Associated With EWA Are Not Finance 
Charges 
As explained in part I.C.2 above, 
Covered EWA is not credit. Thus, given 
that a finance charge is the cost of 
credit, any fees charged in connection 
with Covered EWA cannot be finance 
charges. To the extent any EWA 
products other than Covered EWA are 
credit, fees associated with them can be 
finance charges. This is not to imply 
that any EWA products other than Covered EWA are credit. As noted, the CFPB continues to seek stakeholder 
feedback and evaluate whether it should 
provide additional clarity about whether 
(and when) other EWA products, which 
are not Covered EWA as described here, 
are also not credit under Regulation Z. 
The question addressed in part I.C.3.b 
is whether expedited delivery fees 
associated with EWA are finance 
charges. Part I.C.3.c addresses the 
question of whether tips associated with 
EWA are finance charges.
55
For the 
reasons set forth below, the CFPB 
concludes that, in the normal course, 
fees for expedited delivery of earned 
wages and tips for the receipt of earned 
wages are not finance charges because they are not imposed directly or 
indirectly by the provider. That said, in 
certain factual scenarios discussed 
below, each could be a finance charge. 
a. General 
In general, the obligations of 
Regulation Z apply to any credit 
provider that regularly offers or extends 
consumer credit subject to a finance 
charge.
56
The finance charge is ‘‘the cost 
of consumer credit as a dollar 
amount.’’
57
Unless specifically 
excluded by the regulation, this 
includes ‘‘any charge payable directly or 
indirectly by the consumer and imposed 
directly or indirectly by the creditor as 
an incident to or a condition of the 
extension of credit.’’
58
Thus, to qualify 
as a finance charge, a charge must be 
either ‘‘an incident to’’ or ‘‘a condition of’’ an extension of credit and be ‘‘imposed directly or indirectly’’ by the 
creditor. Providers are required to 
disclose finance charges in the manner 
prescribed by Regulation Z.
59
 
Neither Regulation Z nor TILA 
defines the key terms in the definition 
of ‘‘finance charge’’: ‘‘imposed by,’’ 
‘‘incident to,’’ and ‘‘condition of.’’
60
 
The 1968 edition of Black’s Law 
Dictionary defines ‘‘impose’’ to mean 
‘‘to levy or exact as by authority; to lay 
as a burden, tax, duty, or charge.’’
61
It 
defines ‘‘incident’’ to mean ‘‘anything 
which is usually connected with 
another, or connected for some 
purposes, though not inseparably.’’
62
 
The meaning of ‘‘condition’’ is ‘‘an 
uncertain future act or event whose 
occurrence or nonoccurrence 
determines the rights or obligations of a 
party under a legal instrument and 
especially a contract.’’
63
On their own, 
however, these highly general 
definitions do not provide a clear 
answer to the questions at hand, i.e., 
whether expedited delivery fees and 
tips are finance charges.
64
Rather, it is 
well established that determining 
whether a fee qualifies as a finance 
charge requires a case-by-case 
approach.

CFR 1026, comments 6(a)(2)–2(ix) and (x). The 2024 
PIR sought to distinguish the Board’s interpretation 
on the ground that neither of those expedited 
services ‘‘are as closely and integrally connected to 
the extension of credit as faster funds access is to 
obtaining an earned wage product.’’ 2024 PIR, 89 
FR 61358 at 61362 n.42. But this reasoning is off 
point because the Board based its determinations on 
whether there were options other than the 
expedited option, even if slower.

The 2024 PIR also failed to mention that the 
Board’s 1996 Rule did not simply determine that 
debt cancellation fees are finance charges. It also 
determined that debt cancellation fees are not 
finance charges where the lender provides certain 
disclosures about the debt cancellation agreement. 
See 61 FR 49237 at 49240–41. Thus, even if the Board’s rule were factually on point, it would 
provide support only for a more limited 
interpretation that expedited delivery fees are 
finance charges only if the expedited delivery 
feature is not sufficiently disclosed. Moreover, even 
if it is assumed that fees for debt cancellation 
agreements are factually on point, the Seventh 
Circuit has held that fees for such agreements 
(specifically GAP agreements) are not finance 
charges. See McGee v. Kerr-Hickman, 93 F.3d 380, 383–85 (7th Cir. 1996).

66
ACH delivery 
typically takes one to three days.
67
Most 
also offer one form or another of 
expedited delivery to an account of the 
consumer’s choice. To effectuate such 
delivery, EWA providers incur charges 
from expedited delivery services which 
they then pass on to consumers. 
Consumers that choose this option pay 
fees typically ranging from $2.50 to 
$5.99.
68
Prima facie, these fees are 
charges for expedited delivery rather 
than for receiving a certain amount of 
earned wages. But are they actually 
finance charges? 
There is no need for the CFPB to write 
on a clean slate when answering this 
question. In a 2003 rule, the Board 
considered whether two types of 
expedited fees in connection with credit 
cards accessing home equity lines of 
credit are finance charges: a fee for 
expediting a consumer’s payment, and a 
fee expediting delivery of the physical 
card. As regards the former, the Board 
determined that ‘‘expedited payment 
fees . . . are not finance charges under 
TILA and Regulation Z because the 
consumer has a reasonable means for 
making payment on the account without 
paying a fee to the creditor.’’
69
As 
regards the latter, the Board likewise 
determined that ‘‘a fee for expedited 
delivery of a credit card is not 
incidental to the extension of credit and 
thus is not a finance charge where the 
consumer requests the service and the 
card is also available by standard mail 
service (or another means that is at least 
as fast) without a fee.’’
70
Fees that EWA 
providers charge for expedited delivery 
of EWA fit squarely into this mold, 
since consumers can receive exactly the 
same service without paying the fee. 
Somewhat earlier, the Eleventh 
Circuit in Veale v. Citibank addressed the application of ‘‘finance charge’’ to 
an expedited delivery fee very similar to 
the expedited delivery fees charged by 
EWA providers: a $21 Federal Express 
fee for expedited delivery of loan 
proceeds. The court noted that ‘‘[i]f the borrower can choose to avoid the 
Federal Express fee by having the 
documents sent via regular mail, then 
the fee is not imposed as an incident to 
the extension of credit.’’
71
And the 
court held that ‘‘[s]ince the [borrowers] 
could have chosen not to pay the 
Federal Express fee and the bank did 
not require it, then the fee was not 
imposed as an incident to the extension 
of credit and need not be included in 
the Finance Charge [disclosure].’’
72
 
The 2024 PIR made essentially no 
effort to distinguish Veale. Instead, it attempted to place the entire weight of 
its novel proposed interpretation on a 
1996 Board rule about a very different 
fact pattern: fees charged for debt 
cancellation agreements. Under such an 
agreement, ‘‘the creditor agrees to cancel 
all or part of any remaining debt in the 
event of an occurrence, such as the 
death, disability or unemployment of 
the borrower.’’
73
The Board reasoned 
that fees for such agreements are finance 
charges because the agreement ‘‘alters 
the fundamental nature of the 
borrower’s repayment obligation.’’
74
 
More specifically, it potentially reduces 
the principal amount the consumer 
owes the creditor. Such fees bear little, 
if any, resemblance to fees for expedited 
delivery of earned wages. The earned 
wage amount the provider deducts is 
unaffected by the consumer’s opting for 
expedited delivery; the provider 
deducts the same earned wage amount 
if the consumer opts instead for free 
ACH delivery. 
Ignoring this fundamental difference 
between debt cancellation fees and 
expedited delivery fees, the 2024 PIR 
highlighted more general language in 
the 1996 rule, namely, ‘‘even though a 
lender may not require a particular loan 
feature, the feature may become a term 
of the credit if it is included.’’
75
Relying 
on this formulation, the 2024 PIR 
proposed the facially implausible 
interpretation that fees for expedited 
delivery of earned wages are finance 
charges because earned-wages-plus- 
expedited-delivery is one credit 
product, and earned-wages-without- 
expedited-delivery is an entirely 
different credit product. That 
interpretation conflicts with the long- 
standing interpretation of ‘‘finance 
charge’’ by the Board itself in its 2003 
rule and by the Eleventh Circuit in 
Veale, detailed above. In addition, the 2024 PIR’s reading of the Board’s 1996 
rule would have created a principle 
without any limitation under which any 
fee for anything connected to a credit 
transaction can be transformed into a 
finance charge. All one needs to do is 
create a separate credit product for each 
‘‘feature.’’
76
 
The preceding determination that, in 
the normal course, expedited delivery 
fees associated with EWA are not 
finance charges is not intended to mean 
that expedited delivery fees can never 
be finance charges. The key issue is 
whether such fees are ‘‘directly or 
indirectly imposed’’ on the consumer. 
In the normal course, expedited delivery 
fees are the cost of obtaining earned 
wages more quickly than via ACH, and 
are triggered by the consumer’s opting 
for expedited delivery; they are not 
‘‘directly or indirectly imposed’’ by the 
provider. However, to the extent that an 
EWA provider does impose expedited 
delivery fees on a consumer’s receipt of 
earned wages, those fees could qualify 
as finance charges. Determining whether 
such imposition is occurring is a matter 
that depends on the facts and 
circumstances of a provider’s practices. 
For example, if an EWA provider makes 
it too difficult for consumers to select 
the un-expedited delivery of EWA 
funds, the resulting expedited delivery 
fees may effectively be imposed. 
Providers seeking clarification from the 
CFPB about whether their practices 
concerning expedited delivery fees do 
not amount to the imposition of a 
finance charge may request clarification 
from the CFPB by, for instance, applying 
for an Approval under the Policy on the 
Compliance Assistance Sandbox.

c. Tips 
Tipping is a longstanding, familiar 
aspect of the retail services economy, 
but it has only relatively recently 
appeared in the context of consumer 
financial services. The practice of 
seeking tips, gratuities, and the like is 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:11 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\23DEN1.SGM 23DEN1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60076 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Notices 78
Tip, Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/tip (last updated Oct. 31, 2025); Gratuity, Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gratuity (last updated Oct. 29, 2025). These terms are not defined 
in Black’s Law Dictionary. 
79
The 2024 PIR likewise indicated that 
determining when a tip is imposed depends on the 
facts and circumstances. But it also employed 
various devices designed to stack the deck in favor 
of a determination that tips are finance charges. For 
example, it used quotes for each and every mention 
of the word tip. It identified numerous 
considerations it deemed relevant to making this 
determination. Many of these, however, have no 
basis in the ordinary meaning of the term ‘‘tip’’ and 
the familiar practice of tipping. For example, the 
2024 PIR states that the consumer’s ‘‘reasonable 
understanding that the provider expects a ‘tip’ ’’ is 
evidence that it is imposed. 2024 PIR, 89 FR 61358 
at 61363 n.48. Consumers who are served at a 
restaurant have a ‘‘reasonable understanding’’ that 
the server expects a tip, but that doesn’t mean that 
the server imposes the tip. Another ‘‘relevant 
consideration’’ identified by the 2024 PIR is 
‘‘suggesting ‘‘tip’’ amounts or percentages to the 
consumer.’’ This is now a common practice on POS 
checkout platforms, but no reasonable consumer 
believes this makes any tips selected mandatory. 
80
Depending on the facts and circumstances, a 
provider’s tipping practices could instead or also be 
unlawfully deceptive under 12 U.S.C. 5531, 5536. 
81
See supra note 29 (discussing the Policy on the 
Compliance Assistance Sandbox). Subsequent to 
the issuance of the 2024 PIR, at least five district 
court opinions have appeared that concern products 
that could be classified as EWA, and that hold that 
those products are credit and that expedited 
delivery fees and/or tips associated with those 
products are finance charges. See Orubo v. 
Activehours, Inc., 780 F. Supp. 3d 927, 938 (N.D. 
Cal. Apr. 30, 2025) (motion to dismiss); Johnson v. Activehours, Inc., 2025 WL 2299425, at *9 (D. Md. 
Aug. 8, 2025) (motion to dismiss); Golubiewski v. Activehours, Inc., 2025 WL 2484192, at *1 (M.D. Pa. 
Aug. 28, 2025) (motion to dismiss); Moss v. Cleo AI Inc., 2025 WL 2592265, at *4 (W.D. Wash. Sept. 8, 2025) (motion to dismiss); Vickery v. Empower Finance Inc., 2025 WL 2841686, at *9 (N.D. Cal. 
Oct. 7, 2025) (motion to compel arbitration). All 
rely heavily, directly or indirectly, on the 
application of ‘‘credit’’ to EWA and the application 
of ‘‘finance charge’’ to EWA-related express 
delivery fees and tips in the 2024 PIR, despite the 
fact that the 2024 PIR was merely a proposed 
interpretive rule. The first of the cases, Orubo v. Activehours, quotes liberally from the 2024 PIR. Each of the four subsequent cases then relies 
heavily on Orubo. Now that the CFPB has not only formally withdrawn the 2024 PIR but officially 
rejected the interpretations advanced in it, these 
opinions have no real bearing on this advisory 
opinion.

84
44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. 
relatively common among D2C EWA 
providers, which raises the question of 
whether tips in this context qualify as 
finance charges. In general dictionaries, 
a tip is defined as a gratuity, and a 
gratuity is defined as ‘‘something given 
voluntarily or beyond obligation usually 
for some service.’’
78
To the extent that 
any EWA products are credit, if a 
provider seeks tips in connection with 
the provision of EWA, the tip is 
arguably ‘‘incident to’’ the extension of 
credit. However, it is inherent in the 
meaning of ‘‘tip’’ that it is not imposed, 
even if providing one is considered 
customary. Accordingly, a bona fide tip 
provided by the consumer for EWA 
services cannot be a finance charge. 
To the extent tipping for EWA 
services is not voluntary, however, tips 
can be ‘‘directly or indirectly imposed’’ 
by providers and thus qualify as finance 
charges. The determination of when a 
tip crosses the line from voluntary to 
imposed depends on the facts and 
circumstances of a provider’s 
practices.
79
For example, if the provider 
makes it too difficult to avoid tipping, 
the resulting consumer payment may be 
imposed, at least in part.
80
Providers 
seeking clarification from the CFPB 
about whether their particular practices 
concerning tipping do not rise to the 
level of imposing finance charges may 
request clarification from the CFPB by, 
for instance, applying for an Approval 
under its Policy on the Compliance 
Assistance Sandbox.

II. Regulatory Matters 
This advisory opinion is an 
interpretive rule issued under the 
CFPB’s authority to interpret the Truth 
in Lending Act and Regulation Z, 
including under section 1022(b)(1) of 
the Consumer Financial Protection Act 
of 2010, which authorizes guidance as 
may be necessary or appropriate to 
enable the CFPB to administer and carry 
out the purposes and objectives of 
Federal consumer financial laws.
82
 
As guidance, this interpretive rule 
does not have the force or effect of law. 
It has no legally binding effect, 
including on persons or entities outside 
the Federal government. 
By operation of TILA section 130(f), 
no provision of TILA sections 130, 
108(b), 108(c), 108(e), or 112 imposing 
any liability applies to any act done or 
omitted in good faith in conformity with 
this interpretive rule, notwithstanding 
that after such act or omission has 
occurred, the interpretive rule is 
amended, rescinded, or determined by 
judicial or other authority. 
The Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the 
Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) has determined that this action 
is not a ‘‘significant regulatory action’’ 
under E.O. 12866, as amended. 
Pursuant to the Congressional Review 
Act,
83
the CFPB will submit a report 
containing this advisory opinion and 
other required information to the United 
States Senate, the United States House 
of Representatives, and the Comptroller 
General of the United States prior to the 
interpretive rule taking effect. OIRA has 
designated this advisory opinion as not 
a ‘‘major rule’’ as defined by 5 U.S.C. 
804(2). 
The CFPB has determined that this 
advisory opinion does not contain any 
new or substantively revised 
information collection requirements that 
would require approval by OMB under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The selection, service, and appointment of 
representative organizations to the 
Board are covered by provisions of 
section 302 of Public Law 99–662, as 
amended (33 U.S.C. 2251). The 
substance of those provisions is as 
follows: 
a. Selection. Representative 
organizations are to be selected from the 
spectrum of commercial carriers and 
shippers using the inland and 
intracoastal waterways, to represent 
geographical regions, and to be 
representative of waterborne commerce 
as determined by commodity ton-mile 
statistics. 
b. Service. The Board is required to 
meet at least semi-annually to develop 
and make recommendations to the 
Secretary of the Army on waterways 
construction and major rehabilitation 
priorities and spending levels for 
commercial navigation improvements; 
advise and make recommendations to 
Congress regarding any feasibility report 
for a project on the inland waterways 
that has been submitted to Congress; 
advise and make recommendations to 
Congress regarding an increase in the 
authorized cost of inland waterways 
features and components; advise and 
make recommendations to Congress 
regarding construction, rehabilitation, 
and spending levels after submission of 
the budget proposal of the President to 
Congress; and report its 
recommendations annually to the 
Secretary and Congress. Additionally, 
the Board provides advice and 
recommendations on the development 
of a twenty (20) year capital 
improvement program submitted to 
Congress every five (5) years. 
c. Appointment. The operation of the 
Board and appointment of 
representative organizations are subject 
to chapter 10, 5 U.S.C. (commonly 
known as the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act) and departmental 
implementing regulations. Individuals

Board, or its subcommittees must be 
U.S. citizens and are appointed 
pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 2251(f)(2). The 
members of the Board serve as 
representative members and shall be 
appointed pursuant to 41 CFR 102– 
3.130(a), and in accordance with DoD 
policy and procedures. Representative 
organizations serve without 
compensation but their expenses due to 
Board activities are reimbursable 
pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 2251(f)(3). The 
considerations specified in 33 U.S.C. 
2251 for the selection of representative 
organizations to the Board, and certain 
terms used therein, have been 
interpreted, supplemented, or otherwise 
clarified as follows: 
(1) Carriers and Shippers. 33 U.S.C. 
2251 uses the terms ‘‘primary users and 
shippers.’’ Primary users have been 
interpreted to mean the providers of 
transportation services on inland 
waterways such as barge or towboat 
operators. Shippers have been 
interpreted to mean the purchasers of 
such services for the movement of 
commodities they own or control. 
Representative companies are appointed 
to the Board, and they must be either a 
carrier or shipper or both. For that 
purpose, a trade or regional association 
is neither a shipper nor primary user. 
(2) Geographical Representation. The 
law specifies ‘‘various’’ regions. For the 
purposes of the Board, the waterways 
subjected to fuel taxes and described in 
Public Law 95–502, as amended, have 
been aggregated into six regions. They 
are (1) the Upper Mississippi River and 
its tributaries above the mouth of the 
Ohio; (2) the Lower Mississippi River 
and its tributaries below the mouth of 
the Ohio and above Baton Rouge; (3) the 
Ohio River and its tributaries; (4) the 
Gulf Intracoastal Waterway in Louisiana 
and Texas; (5) the Gulf Intracoastal 
Waterway east of New Orleans and 
associated fuel-taxed waterways 
including the Tennessee-Tombigbee, 
plus the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway 
below Norfolk; and (6) the Columbia- 
Snake Rivers System and Upper 
Willamette. The intent is that each 
region shall be represented by at least 
one representative organization, with 
that representation determined by the 
regional concentration of the firm’s 
traffic on the waterways. 
(3) Commodity Representation. 
Waterway commerce has been 
aggregated into six commodity 
categories based on ‘‘inland’’ ton-miles 
shown in Waterborne Commerce of the 
United States. These categories are (1) 
Farm and Food Products; (2) Coal and 
Coke; (3) Petroleum, Crude and 
Products; (4) Minerals, Ores, and 
Primary Metals and Mineral Products; 
(5) Chemicals and Allied Products; and 
(6) All Other. A consideration in the 
selection of representative organizations 
to the Board will be that the 
commodities carried or shipped by 
those firms will be reasonably 
representative of the above commodity 
categories. 
d. Nomination. Individuals, firms, or 
associations may nominate 
representative organizations to serve on 
the Board. Nominations will: 
(1) Include the commercial operations 
of the carrier and/or shipper 
representative organization being 
nominated. This commercial operations 
information will show the actual or 
estimated ton-miles of each commodity 
carried or shipped on the inland 
waterways system in the most recent 
year (or years), using the waterway 
regions and commodity categories 
previously listed. Only ton-miles will be 
accepted. 
(2) State the region(s) to be 
represented. 
(3) State whether the nominated 
representative organization is a carrier, 
shipper or both. 
(4) Provide the name of an individual 
to be the principal person representing 
the organization and information 
pertaining to their personal 
qualifications, to include a current 
within six months biography or resume. 
Previous nominations received in 
responses to the published documents

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 
34 CFR Part 395 Limitation of the 
Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facility 
Program Priority for the Department of 
the Army 
AGENCY: Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, Department of 
Education. 
ACTION: Approval of a limitation of the Randolph-Sheppard priority for the 
Department of the Army. 
SUMMARY: The Secretary has found that the placement and operation of dining 
facilities (DFACs), through the 
Randolph-Sheppard priority, on 
Department of the Army installations 
adversely affects the interests of the 
United States. As such, the Secretary 
has approved a limitation of the 
Randolph-Sheppard priority for the 
Department of the Army’s DFAC 
contracts. 
DATES: The limitation of the priority is approved on December 23, 2025. This 
limitation applies prospectively to 
DFAC contracts entered into by 
Department of the Army after the date 
of publication of this notice.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
The Randolph-Sheppard Vending 
Facility Program provides entrepreneurs 
who are blind with opportunities to 
operate a business in competitive 
integrated employment consistent with 
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as 
amended by title IV of the Workforce 
Innovation and Opportunity Act. In 
1936, Congress established the program, 
through the Randolph-Sheppard Act, to 
enhance employment opportunities for 
trained, licensed blind persons to 
operate vending facilities on federal and 
other properties. Blind vendors are 
licensed by State licensing agencies 
(SLAs); SLAs are typically State 
Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) agencies. 
Each state (except Wyoming), Puerto 
Rico, and the District of Columbia 
operate a Randolph-Sheppard Vending 
Facility Program. In FFY 2024, there 
were approximately 1,200 licensed 
blind vendors. For the Department of 
the Army specifically, 24 DFAC 
contracts, across 22 installations in the 
United States, are currently awarded to 
SLAs through the Randolph-Sheppard 
priority. 
Authority 
The Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 
U.S.C. 107 et seq., and the Department’s 
regulations implementing it at 34 CFR 
part 395, establish a priority for

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60079 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Notices operation of vending facilities and 
cafeterias on Federal properties by blind 
vendors licensed by SLAs, where such 
operation is feasible and would not 
adversely affect the interests of the 
United States. Upon justification 
provided by a Federal department or 
agency to the Secretary, and the 
Secretary’s determination that 
placement or operation of a vending 
facility or cafeteria adversely affects the 
interests of the United States and thus 
justifies a limitation on such placement 
or operation, the limitation becomes 
effective upon publication by the 
Secretary in the Federal Register. 34 
CFR 395.30(a) and (b). 
Justification of Limitation 
Based on information provided by the 
Department of the Army, the Secretary 
has determined that a limitation of the 
Randolph-Sheppard priority is justified 
for the Department of the Army’s DFAC 
contracts. The Secretary acknowledges 
that the Randolph-Sheppard Vending 
Facility program, as applied to the 
Department of the Army’s DFAC 
contracts, adversely affects the interests 
of the United States. Specifically, the 
Department of the Army’s critical role in 
national security and the paramount 
importance of maintaining operational 
mission readiness of its service 
members necessitates removal of 
barriers that prevent the Department of 
the Army from being in the best position 
possible to conduct its procurements 
and manage its DFAC contracts. Based 
on the Department of the Army’s 
representations, it is clear that the 
Randolph-Sheppard priority hinders the 
Department of the Army’s ability to act 
swiftly, efficiently, and cost-effectively 
in procuring and managing DFAC 
contracts, which negatively impacts the 
availability and quality of food options 
for the nation’s warfighters. 
Higher Costs 
Randolph-Sheppard regulations at 34 
CFR 395.33(b) stipulate that when a 
proposal submitted by an SLA for the 
operation of a DFAC is determined to be 
within the competitive range, the 
agency shall consult with the Secretary 
as described in 34 CFR 395.33(a). The 
Secretary considered that the 
Department of the Army reported an 
instance where a DFAC contract had a 
33 percent higher price differential and 
a cumulative difference of $164 million 
more when comparing lowest price 
technically acceptable proposals with 
some proposals made by SLAs over a 
five-year period. The higher costs from 
applying the Randolph-Sheppard 
priority may also have the adverse effect 
of decreasing funds available for other 
investments critical to ensuring service 
member readiness. According to the 
Department of the Army, this 
requirement has stifled its ability to 
select a vendor proposing innovative 
approaches and process improvements, 
better service, and cost savings. The 
Secretary thus has determined, after 
consultation with the Department of the 
Army, that operation of DFACs subject 
to a Randolph-Sheppard priority cannot 
be provided at a reasonable cost. 
Arbitration Delays 
SLAs are afforded the right to 
arbitration in the Randolph-Sheppard 
Act. On average, the Department of the 
Army has faced arbitrations that last 801 
days resulting in significant delays in 
awarding DFAC contracts. The Secretary 
considers it unreasonable to expect the 
Department of the Army to be entangled 
in any DFAC contract arbitration that 
could last for more than two years. The 
Secretary believes this is an 
unreasonable burden to place on the 
Department of the Army, thus a 
limitation on applicability of the Act for 
Department of the Army DFAC contracts 
is justified. 
Performance Issues 
The Department of the Army 
conveyed various examples of 
performance issues with Randolph- 
Sheppard DFAC contracts including 
nutrition (e.g., not including nutritional menu standards and serving meals that 
do not meet requirements) and 
sanitation (e.g., cross-contamination of food and improper labeling). Other 
reported performance issues include 
food safety (e.g., foreign objects in food) and lack of documented employee 
training related to safety and sanitation. 
Conclusion 
For these reasons, the Secretary has 
concluded that a limitation of the 
Randolph-Sheppard priority is justified 
for future DFAC contracts competed by 
the Department of the Army. The 
Secretary notes that blind vendors may 
still bid for DFAC contracts even if there 
is no Randolph-Sheppard priority in 
place.

Authority for Conducting the Matching 
Program 
This matching program is authorized 
by the FUTURE Act, as amended. The 
FUTURE Act amended section 
6103(l)(13) of the IRC to authorize the 
IRS to disclose to ED certain FTI for the 
purposes set forth in the 
SUPPLEMENTARY 
INFORMATIONsection of this Notice 
provided certain conditions are 
satisfied. In addition, 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3) 
provides authority for the IRS to 
disclose Privacy Act-protected records 
to the Department pursuant to a 
published routine use in an applicable 
system of records notice for a purpose 
that is compatible with the purposes for 
which the IRS collected the records. 
Further, the Department is authorized to 
participate in the matching program 
pursuant to the HEA, including sections 
483 and 494(a) and (b) of the HEA (20 
U.S.C. 1090 and 1098h(a) and (b)) and 
the FUTURE Act. 
Purpose(s) 
The purpose of this matching program 
between the IRS and the Department is 
for the IRS to disclose to the Department 
certain FTI of an individual, upon 
approval being provided by the 
individual to the Department, for 
determining eligibility for, or repayment 
obligations under, IDR plans under title 
IV of the HEA with respect to loans 
under part D of title IV of the HEA; and 
determining eligibility for, and amount 
of, Federal student financial aid under 
a program authorized under subpart 1 of 
part A, part C, or part D of title IV of 
the HEA. 
The FTI that the IRS discloses to ED 
under sections 6103(l)(13)(A) and (C) of 
the IRC may also be used by the 
Department for the purposes of: (a) 
reducing the net cost of improper 
payments: (i) under IDR plans and (ii) 
relating to awards of Federal student 
financial aid under the Pell Grant, FWS 
and Direct Loan programs; (b) oversight 
by ED’s OIG as authorized by chapter 4 
of title 5 of the United States Code, 
except for the purpose of conducting 
criminal investigations or prosecutions; 
and (c) conducting analyses and 
forecasts for estimating costs related to: 
(i) IDR plans and (ii) awards of Federal 
student financial aid under a program 
authorized under the Pell Grant, FWS 
and Direct Loan programs, as set forth 
in IRC § 6103(l)(13)(D). The FTI will not 
be duplicated or redisclosed for these 
uses. 
The FTI information that the 
Department will obtain as a result of 
this matching program effectuates the 
purpose of the HEA because it provides 
an efficient and comprehensive match 
to determine eligibility for, and the 
amount of, Federal student financial aid 
under a program authorized under 
subpart 1 of part A, part C, or part D of 
title IV of the HEA, and eligibility for, 
or repayment obligations under, IDR 
plans for loans under the Federal Direct 
Loan Program. 
Categories of Individuals 
This matching program covers 
students (including a student’s spouse 
for an independent student and a 
student’s parent(s) for dependent 
student) who apply for Federal student 
financial assistance under title IV of the 
HEA through the Free Application for 
Federal Student Aid (FAFSA

) and 
borrowers (including spouses of 
borrowers who are independent 
students) who have had a loan 
disbursed and are fully responsible to 
pay the loan and interest back to the 
loan holder under applicable Federal 
student loan programs administered 
under the authority of title IV of the 
HEA, or who have such a loan written 
off due to default. This matching 
program also includes as a ‘‘borrower’’ 
an individual who is responsible for 
completing a service obligation and fails 
to complete the service obligation in 
exchange for having received a grant 
under the Teacher Education Assistance 
for College and Higher Education 
(TEACH) Grant Program authorized 
under subpart 9 of part A of title IV of 
the HEA. 
Categories of Records 
This matching program covers the 
following categories of records: 
(1) An applicant’s information 
submitted to the Department to 
determine the applicant’s eligibility for 
Federal student financial assistance 
under a program authorized under 
subpart 1 of part A, part C, or part D of 
title IV of the HEA; 
(2) A borrower’s information 
submitted to ED to determine the 
borrower’s eligibility for, or repayment 
obligations under, IDR plans under title 
IV of the HEA with respect to loans 
under part D of title IV of the HEA; 
(3) An applicant’s approval and 
consent submitted to ED to process an 
application for determining eligibility 
for Federal student financial assistance 
under a program authorized under 
subpart 1 of part A, part C, or part D of 
aid under title IV of the HEA; 
(4) A borrower’s approval and consent 
submitted to ED to process an 
application for determining eligibility 
for, or repayment obligations under, IDR

respect to loans under part D of title IV 
of the HEA; and 
(5) FTI on individuals from the IRS’ 
Customer Account Data Engine (CADE) 
Individual Master File. 
More specifically, the Department 
will transmit the following specific data 
elements to the IRS under the matching 
program: 
(1) Social Security Number (SSN)/ 
Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN); 
(2) Tax year for which FTI is required; 
(3) Last name; 
(4) Date of birth (DOB); 
(5) Unique identifier; and 
(6) Date/time stamp of the 
individual’s approval for use of FTI in 
determining eligibility by ED. 
In addition, in response to a valid 
request submitted by ED to the IRS 
pursuant to section 6103(l)(13)(A) of the 
IRC (IDR request) that matches a tax 
record for the requested SSN/TIN and 
tax year, the IRS will return the 
following specific data elements to ED:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: ST LNG requests authorization to export 
domestically produced LNG from its 
proposed Project to be located at Brazos 
Block BA–476 in Federal waters in the 
Gulf of America, offshore of Matagorda, 
Texas. ST LNG states that the Project 
will be a deepwater port under the 
Deepwater Port Act of 1974, as 
amended. ST LNG seeks to export LNG 
in a volume equivalent to 460 Bcf/yr of 
natural gas (equivalent to approximately 
8.4 million metric tons per annum) by 
ocean-going vessel on a non-additive 
basis to: (i) any country with which the 
United States has entered into a free 
trade agreement (FTA) requiring 
national treatment for trade in natural 
gas (FTA countries), and (ii) any other 
country with which trade is not 
prohibited by U.S. law or policy (non- 
FTA countries). This Notice applies 
only to the portion of the Application 
requesting authority to export LNG to 
non-FTA countries pursuant to section 
3(a) of the NGA.
1
DOE will review ST 
LNG’s request for authorization to 
export LNG to FTA countries separately 
pursuant to NGA section 3(c).
2
 
ST LNG seeks this authorization on its 
own behalf and as agent for other 
entities that will hold title to the LNG 
at the time of export. ST LNG requests 
the authorization for a term to 
commence on the date of first export 
following the commencement of 
commercial operation of the Project, and 
to extend through December 31, 2050, 
plus a three-year Make-Up Period 
extending through December 31, 2053, 
consistent with recent DOE practice.

project, but [that] in the past, it has 
encountered significant and unforeseen 
delays due to global macroeconomic 
and geopolitical disruptions.’’
6
Epcilon 
asserts that these delays have been fully 
resolved, and Epcilon ‘‘intends to take 
FID (Final Investment Decision) in early 
Q1 2026’’ for the Project.
7
Therefore, 
according to Epcilon, the requested 
commencement extension will enable 
the Project to reach FID and proceed to 
the construction phase.
8
Epcilon adds 
that the Request is limited solely to an 
extension of time and does not seek any 
modification to the scope, configuration, 
or nature of the Project.

l. Description of Request: The licensee requests a temporary variance of the 
release requirements under Article 401 
that require it, in part, to release from 
Courtright Dam into Helms Creek a 
minimum flow of 4 cubic feet per 
second (cfs) from June 1 through 
November 30, as measured at gaging 
station downstream of the dam (KI–17). 
With the variance, the licensee proposes 
to reduce flow released into Helms 
Creek to 2.5 cfs September 1 through 
November 30, 2026, with compliance 
assessed by a 24-hour average of 
measurements taken by KI–17. In 
addition, though Courtright Reservoir 
does not have a license-required 
minimum elevation, the licensee 
advises they will draw down the 
reservoir to an elevation of 8,000 feet, 
with an impoundment of 2,283 acre- 
feet, from September 1 through 
December 31, 2026. The licensee states 
that the requested variance and 
reservoir drawdown is necessary to 
complete repair and replacement 
projects related to maintaining 
Courtright Dam, its low-level outlet 
bypass valve, and the KI–17 weir.

Type of Request: Update information 
collection requirements with changes to 
the current reporting requirements. 
Abstract: Section 215 of the FPA provides that the Commission may 
certify an Electric Reliability 
Organization (ERO), the purpose of 
which is to develop mandatory and 
enforceable Reliability Standards, 
subject to Commission review and 
approval.
1
Reliability Standards may be 
enforced by the ERO, subject to 
Commission oversight, or by the 
Commission independently.
2
Pursuant 
to section 215 of the FPA, the 
Commission established a process to 
select and certify an ERO,
3
and 
subsequently certified NERC.
4
 
On October 1, 2025, in Docket No. 
RD25–10, the Commission approved 
NERC’s filing of a petition seeking 
approval of two revised NERC 
definitions, generator owner and 
generator operator as ‘‘to align the 
definitions of the Generator Owner and 
Generator Operator terms in the NERC 
Glossary with the recently revised 
Generator Owner and Generator 
Operator registration functions in the 
NERC Rules of Procedure Statement of 
Compliance Registry Criteria,’’
5
 
approved by the Commission in Docket 
No. RR24–2–000 on June 27, 2024.
6
The 
terms generator owner and generator 
operator now include non-bulk electric 
system (BES) inverter-based resources 
(IBR) that either have or contribute to an 
aggregate nameplate capacity of greater 
than or equal to 20 MVA, connected 
through a system designed primarily for 
delivering such capacity to a common 
point of connection at a voltage greater 
than or equal to 60 kV (category 2). 
Consequently, the new definitions in 
the Glossary of Terms Used in NERC 
Reliability Standards (NERC Glossary) 
will impose paperwork burdens on 
category 2 generator owners and 
generator operators that will now need 
to comply with applicable Reliability 
Standards. 
The approved revision to the 
definition of generator owner in the 
NERC Glossary is:
7
 
The entity that: (1) owns and 
maintains generating Facility(ies) 
(Category 1 GO); or (2) owns and 
maintains non-BES Inverter-Based 
Resource(s) that either have or 
contribute to an aggregate nameplate 
capacity of greater than or equal to 20 
MVA, connected through a system 
designed primarily for delivering such 
capacity to a common point of 
connection at a voltage greater than or 
equal to 60 kV (Category 2 GO). 
The approved revision to the 
definition of generator operator in the 
NERC Glossary is:
8
 
The entity that: (1) operates 
generating Facility(ies) and performs the 
functions of supplying energy and 
Interconnected Operations Services 
(Category 1 GOP); or (2) operates non- 
BES Inverter-Based Resource(s) that 
either have or contribute to an aggregate 
nameplate capacity of greater than or 
equal to 20 MVA, connected through a 
system designed primarily for delivering 
such capacity to a common point of 
connection at a voltage greater than or 
equal to 60 kV (Category 2 GOP). 
As a result of the inclusion of category 
2 resources in the NERC Glossary, 
applicable responsible entities will have 
to comply with reporting requirements 
for this information collection for each 
of the eight reliability standards 
included in NERC’s implementation 
plan associated with Docket No. RD25– 
10. The eight applicable Reliability 
Standards are: BAL–001–TRE–2; IRO– 
010–5; MOD–032–1; PRC–012–2; PRC– 
017–1; TOP–003–6.1; VAR–001–5; and 
VAR–002–4.1. 
Reliability Standard BAL–001–TRE–2 
is currently located in the FERC–725T 
(OMB Control No. 1902–0273) 
collection. The purpose of Reliability 
Standard BAL–001–TRE–2 is to 
maintain interconnection steady-state 
frequency within defined limits. The 
category 2 generator owners and 
generator operators will now have to 
follow Requirements R6 through R10. 
Requirements R6, R7, R9, and R10 
require the generator owner to set their 
governor parameters to be responsive to 
frequency obligations and provide 
notification to other entities when their 
governor is unavailable. Requirement R8 
requires generator operators notify their 
balancing authority of service status 
changes. 
Reliability Standard IRO–010–5 is 
currently located in the FERC–725Z 
(OMB Control No. 1902–0276) 
collection. The purpose of the standard 
is to prevent instability, uncontrolled 
separation, or cascading outages that 
adversely impact reliability by ensuring 
each reliability coordinator has the data 
and information it needs to plan, 
monitor and assess the operation of its 
reliability coordinator area. The 
category 2 generator owners and 
operators will now have to meet 
Requirement R3 that requires the 
generator owners and generator 
operators to satisfy the obligations of the 
documented specifications from the 
reliability coordinator on data and 
information needed for the operational 
planning analyses, real-time monitoring, 
and real-time assessments. Reliability 
Standard MOD–032–1 is currently 
located in the FERC–725L (OMB Control 
No. 1902–0261) collection. The purpose 
of the standard is to establish consistent 
modeling data requirements and 
reporting procedures for development of 
planning horizon cases necessary to 
support analysis of the reliability of the 
interconnected transmission system. 
The category 2 generator owners will 
now have to follow Requirements R2 
and R3 that require generator owners 
provide modeling data to and address 
any concerns raised by the planning 
coordinator or transmission planner. 
Reliability Standards PRC–012–2 and 
PRC–017–1 are currently located in the 
FERC–725G (OMB Control No. 1902– 
0252) collection. The purpose of PRC– 
012–2 is to ensure that remedial action 
schemes (RAS) do not introduce 
unintentional or unacceptable reliability 
risks to the BES. The stated purpose of 
Reliability Standard PRC–017–1 is to 
ensure that all RAS are properly 
designed, meet performance 
requirements, and are coordinated with 
other protection systems and to ensure 
that maintenance and testing programs 
are developed and misoperations are 
analyzed and corrected. The category 2 
generator owners, that are part of a RAS, 
will now have to follow Requirements 
R1, R3, and R5 through R8 in Reliability 
Standard PRC–012–2 and Requirements 
R1 and R2 in Reliability Standard PRC– 
017–1. Specifically, Reliability Standard 
PRC–012–2 requires that generator 
owners that own all or part of a RAS to 
review and provide information to their 
reliability coordinator in R1 and R3; and 
to test, analyze performance, and take 
corrective action, if needed, in 
Requirements R5 through R8.

‘‘Burden’’ is defined as the total time, effort, or 
financial resources expended by persons to 
generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or provide 
information to or for a Federal agency. For further 
explanation of what is included in the information 
collection burden, see 5 CFR 1320.3.

The numbers for respondents were derived 
from the NERC’s identification of category 2 
generator owners and generator operators registered 
entities in the United States to Commission staff in 
August 2025.

The estimated hourly cost (salary plus benefits) 
is a combination of the following categories from 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) website, May 
2024 http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/naics2_22.htm: 75% of the average of an Electrical Engineer (17¥2071) $71.19/hr., × .75 = 53.3925 ($53.39- rounded) ($53.39/hour); and 25% of an Information 
and Record Clerk (43¥4199) $40.51/hr., $40.51 × 
.25 = 10.1275 ($10.13 rounded) ($10.13/hour), for 
a total ($53.39 + $10.13 = $63.52/hour).

See note 11. 
Standard PRC–017–1 require generator 
owners that own a RAS to maintain and 
document a system maintenance and 
testing program. 
Reliability Standard TOP–003–6.1 is 
currently located in the FERC–725A 
(OMB Control No. 1902–0244) 
collection. The purpose of this standard 
is to ensure that each transmission 
operator and balancing authority has the 
data and information it needs to plan, 
monitor, and assess the operation of its 
transmission operator area or balancing 
authority area. The category 2 generator 
owners and generator operators will 
now have to follow Requirement R5, 
which requires generator owners and 
generator operators to satisfy the 
obligations of the documented 
specifications of data and information 
related to operational planning analyses, 
real-time monitoring, and real-time 
assessments provided by the 
transmission operator or balancing 
authority. 
Reliability Standards VAR–001–5 and 
VAR–002–4.1 are currently located in 
the FERC–725X (OMB Control No. 
1902–0278) collection. The purpose of 
Reliability Standard VAR–001–5 is to 
ensure that voltage levels, reactive 
flows, and reactive resources are 
monitored, controlled, and maintained 
within limits in real-time to protect 
equipment and the reliable operation of 
the interconnection. The purpose of 
Reliability Standard VAR–002–4.1 is to 
ensure generators provide reactive 
support and voltage control, within 
generating facility capabilities, in order 
to protect equipment and maintain 
reliable operation of the 
interconnection. The category 2 
generator owners in Western Electricity 
Coordinating Council (WECC) will now 
have to follow Requirements E.A.15 and 
E.A.17 in Reliability Standard VAR– 
001–5. The category 2 generator 
operators will now have to follow 
Reliability Standard VAR–002–4.1, 
Requirements R1 through 4 and the 
category 2 generator owners will now 
have to follow Requirements R5 and R6. 
Specifically, Requirements E.A.15 and 
E.A. 17 require generator operators in 
WECC to provide voltage set point 
conversion methodologies to its 
transmission operator and to meet 
control loop specifications. 
Requirements R1 through 4 of 
Reliability Standard VAR–002–4.1 
require the generator operators to 
operate their generators in automatic 
voltage control mode, maintain voltage 
schedules, and to notify their 
transmission operator in the event of a 
change. Requirements R5 and R6 require 
the generator owner to provide data and 
tap settings information to their 
transmission operator and transmission 
planner and to ensure transformer tap 
positions are changed according to the 
specifications provided by the 
transmission operator. 
Type of Respondents: Generator 
owners and generator operator entities 
registered with NERC that own or 
operate category 2 resources. 
Estimate of Annual Burden:
9
The 
applicable requirements from the eight 
applicable Reliability Standards largely 
consist of sharing and communicating 
readily available data and information 
for category 2 resources. Thus, 
Commission staff anticipates that the 
paperwork burden should be minimal 
for category 2 resources. The number of 
respondents, in the tables below, are 
based on good faith estimates provided 
by NERC, in August 2025, to 
Commission staff for the number of 
entities that either own or operate 
category 2 resources. 
The Commission estimates the annual 
reporting burden and cost for the 
information collection as:

(Columbia) in Lincoln County and 
Pulaski County, Kentucky. The 
Commission will use this environmental 
document in its decision-making 
process to determine whether the 
project is in the public convenience and 
necessity. 
On November 24, 2025, FERC staff 
issued a Notice of Scoping Period 
Requesting Comments on 
Environmental Issues for the Pulaski 
Project and Notice of Public Scoping 
Session. It was brought to FERC staff attention that the notice may not have 
been mailed properly to the 
environmental mailing list. This notice 
is being sent to an updated 
environmental mailing list and extends 
the scoping period for the project. 
This notice announces the opening of 
the scoping process the Commission 
will use to gather input from the public 
and interested agencies regarding the 
project. As part of the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) 
review process, the Commission takes 
into account concerns the public may 
have about proposals and the 
environmental impacts that could result 
from its action whenever it considers 
the issuance of a Certificate of Public 
Convenience and Necessity. This 
gathering of public input is referred to 
as ‘‘scoping.’’ The main goal of the 
scoping process is to focus the analysis 
in the environmental document on the 
important environmental issues. 
Additional information about the 
Commission’s NEPA process is 
described below in the NEPA Process 
and Environmental Document section of 
this notice. 
By this notice, the Commission 
requests public comments on the scope 
of issues to address in the 
environmental document. To ensure 
that your comments are timely and 
properly recorded, please submit your 
comments so that the Commission 
receives them in Washington, DC on or 
before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 
January 20, 2025. Comments may be 
submitted in written. Further details on 
how to submit comments are provided 
in the Public Participation section of 
this notice. 
Your comments should focus on the 
potential environmental effects, 
reasonable alternatives, and measures to 
avoid or lessen environmental impacts. 
Your input will help the Commission 
staff determine what issues they need to 
evaluate in the environmental 
document. Commission staff will 
consider all comments during the 
preparation of the environmental 
document. 
If you submitted comments on this 
project to the Commission before the 
opening of this docket on October 15, 
2025, you will need to file those 
comments in Docket No. CP26–11–000 
to ensure they are considered as part of 
this proceeding. 
This notice is being sent to the 
Commission’s current environmental 
mailing list for this project. State and 
local government representatives should 
notify their constituents of this 
proposed project and encourage them to 
comment on their areas of concern. 
If you are a landowner receiving this 
notice, a pipeline company 
representative may contact you about 
the acquisition of an easement to 
construct, operate, and maintain the 
proposed facilities. The company would 
seek to negotiate a mutually acceptable 
easement agreement. You are not 
required to enter into an agreement. 
However, if the Commission approves 
the project, the Natural Gas Act conveys 
the right of eminent domain to the 
company. Therefore, if you and the 
company do not reach an easement 
agreement, the pipeline company could 
initiate condemnation proceedings in 
court. In such instances, compensation 
would be determined by a judge in 
accordance with state law. The 
Commission does not subsequently 
grant, exercise, or oversee the exercise 
of that eminent domain authority. The 
courts have exclusive authority to 
handle eminent domain cases; the 
Commission has no jurisdiction over 
these matters. 
Columbia provided landowners with 
a fact sheet prepared by the FERC 
entitled ‘‘An Interstate Natural Gas 
Facility On My Land? What Do I Need 
To Know?’’ which addresses typically 
asked questions, including the use of 
eminent domain and how to participate 
in the Commission’s proceedings. This 
fact sheet along with other landowner 
topics of interest are available for 
viewing on the FERC website 
(www.ferc.gov) under the Natural Gas, 
Landowner Topics link.

Summary of the Proposed Project 
Columbia proposes to install and 
operate 41.3 miles of new 30-inch- 
diameter greenfield natural gas pipeline 
from Lincoln County Kentucky to the 
new South Somerset Delivery Meter 
Station located in Pulaski County, 
Kentucky, with additional aboveground 
facilities. The Pulaski Project would 
provide about 253 million standard 
cubic feet of natural gas per day to the 
John S. Cooper Power Station in Pulaski 
County, Kentucky. According to 
Columbia, its project would service its 
new and existing generation resources.

The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation’s 
regulations are at Title 36, Code of Federal 
Regulations, Part 800. Those regulations define 
historic properties as any prehistoric or historic 
district, site, building, structure, or object included 
in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register 
of Historic Places. 
The Pulaski Project would consist of 
the following facilities: 
€41.3 miles of new 30-inch-diameter greenfield natural gas pipeline; 
€a proposed tie-in to the Columbia Mainline in Lincoln County, Kentucky, 
including a new launcher/receiver and 
bidirectional pig
1
trap; 
€a new meter and regulator station designated as the South Somerset 
Delivery Meter Station in Pulaski 
County, Kentucky, including a tie-in to 
East Kentucky Power Cooperative’s 
(EKPC’s) John S. Cooper Power Station, 
a new launcher/receiver, and a 
bidirectional pig trap; and 
€four new mainline valves. The general location of the project 
facilities is shown in appendix 1. 
Land Requirements for Construction 
Construction of the proposed facilities 
would disturb about 657.2 acres of land 
for the aboveground facilities and the 
pipeline. Following construction, 
Columbia would maintain about 254.0 
acres for permanent operation of the 
project’s facilities; the remaining 
acreage would be restored and revert to 
former uses. About 27 percent of the 
proposed pipeline route parallels 
existing EKPC and/or Kentucky Utilities 
Company rights-of-way. 
NEPA Process and the Environmental 
Document 
Any environmental document issued 
by the Commission will discuss impacts 
that could occur as a result of the 
construction and operation of the 
proposed project under the relevant 
general resource areas: 
€geology and soils; €water resources and wetlands; €vegetation and wildlife; €threatened and endangered species; €cultural resources; €land use; €socioeconomics; €air quality and noise; and €reliability and safety. Commission staff will also evaluate 
reasonable alternatives to the proposed 
project or portions of the project and 
make recommendations on how to 
lessen or avoid impacts on the various 
resource areas. Your comments will 
help Commission staff identify and 
focus on the issues that might have an 
effect on the human environment and 
potentially eliminate others from further 
study and discussion in the 
environmental document. 
Following this scoping period, 
Commission staff will determine 
whether to prepare an Environmental 
Assessment (EA) or an Environmental 
Impact Statement (EIS). The EA or the 
EIS will present Commission staff’s 
independent analysis of the issues. If 
Commission staff prepares an EA, a 
Notice of Schedule for the Preparation 
of an Environmental Assessment will be 
issued. The EA may be issued for an 
allotted public comment period. The 
Commission would consider timely 
comments on the EA before making its 
decision regarding the proposed project. 
If Commission staff prepares an EIS, a 
Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS/ 
Notice of Schedule will be issued, 
which will open up an additional 
comment period. Staff will then prepare 
a draft EIS which will be issued for 
public comment. Commission staff will 
consider all timely comments received 
during the comment period on the draft

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY 
Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission 
[Project No. 2545–205] 
Avista Corporation; Notice of Intent To 
Prepare an Environmental Assessment 
On July 3, 2024, Avista Corporation 
filed an application for non-capacity 
amendment at the Spokane River 
Hydroelectric Project No. 2545. The 
dam is located on the Spokane River in 
Spokane, Lincoln, and Stevens counties, 
Washington, and in Kootenai and 
Benewah counties, Idaho. 
To rehabilitate the spillway at the 
North Channel Dam, the licensee 
proposed to replace all existing gates. 
The North Channel Dam is L-shaped, 
and its primary spillway structure 
currently consists of one 100-foot-long 
rolling sector gate, seven 21-foot-long 
Tainter gates, and one 12-foot-long 
Tainter gate. The proposed 
rehabilitation involves replacing the 
existing spillway gates within the same 
footprint without any significant change 
in elevation, surface area, or capacity. 
The project would not alter the project 
boundary, reservoir levels, down- 
ramping rate, or minimum flow 
requirements. The project would also 
continue to operate under the terms of 
its current license and applicable Water 
Quality Certification. The licensee states 
that no resource agencies have objected 
to the proposed rehabilitation, and no 
long-term effects to project operations or 
environmental resources are 
anticipated. Temporary impacts would 
be limited to ground disturbance in 
construction areas and a temporary 
suspension of aesthetic spills during 
construction. 
On June 18, 2025, Commission staff 
issued a public notice for the proposed 
amendment, accepted the application 
for filing, and solicited comments, 
motions to intervene, and protests. The 
public comment period closed on July 
18, 2025. On July 17, 2025, the Idaho 
Governor’s Office of Energy & Mineral 
Resources filed a response to the 
Commission’s notice. 
This notice identifies Commission 
staff’s intention to prepare an 
environmental assessment (EA) under 
the National Environmental Policy Act 
(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) for the project.
1
 
Commission staff plans to issue an EA 
by April 10, 2026. Revisions to the 
schedule may be made as appropriate. 
The EA will be issued for a 30-day 
comment period. All comments filed on 
the EA will be reviewed by staff and 
considered in the Commission’s final 
decision on the proceeding.

On July 3, 2024, Commission staff issued an 
order approving the licensee’s request to replace the 
Unit 3 turbine runner at the Middlebury Lower 
Project. 
1
Motion for Extension of Time at 2. 
Commission staff are not considered 
part of the Commission record. 
The Commission’s Rules of Practice 
and Procedure require all intervenors 
filing documents with the Commission 
to serve a copy of that document on 
each person whose name appears on the 
official service list for the project. 
Further, if an intervenor files comments 
or documents with the Commission 
relating to the merits of an issue that 
may affect the responsibilities of a 
particular resource agency, they must 
also serve a copy of the document on 
that resource agency. 
l. Description of Request: On August 1, 2001, the Commission issued 30-year 
licenses for the Weybridge (Project No. 
2731) and Middlebury Lower (Project 
No. 2737) hydroelectric projects that 
expire on July 31, 2031. The licensee 
requests the Commission extend the 
term of both licenses to July 31, 2041. 
The extension would allow the licensee 
to recoup rehabilitation costs associated 
with planned turbine runner 
replacement programs at each project.
1
 
The licensee also proposes to replace 
the turbine runner at the Weybridge 
Project. The proposed upgrade would 
maintain the project’s authorized 
installed capacity of 3.0 megawatts and 
decrease the maximum hydraulic 
capacity of the powerhouse from 1,600 
cubic feet per second (cfs) to 1,590 cfs. 
The licensee states all construction 
activities associated with the proposed 
amendment would occur within the 
Weybridge powerhouse and would be 
isolated from the river. Access to the 
powerhouse area during the 
mobilization and demobilization phases 
would be via the existing access road, 
and would not require any ground 
disturbance. The licensee does not 
propose any changes to the licensed 
project operations during or after 
turbine runner replacement. 
m. Locations of the Application: This filing may be viewed on the 
Commission’s website at http://

n. Individuals desiring to be included 
on the Commission’s mailing list should 
so indicate by writing to the Secretary 
of the Commission. 
o. Comments, Protests, or Motions to Intervene: Anyone may submit comments, a protest, or a motion to 
intervene in accordance with the 
requirements of Rules of Practice and 
Procedure, 18 CFR 385.210, .211, .214, 
respectively. In determining the 
appropriate action to take, the 
Commission will consider all protests or 
other comments filed, but only those 
who file a motion to intervene in 
accordance with the Commission’s 
Rules may become a party to the 
proceeding. Any comments, protests, or 
motions to intervene must be received

Time 
On December 15, 2025, the National 
Hydropower Association (NHA) filed a 
motion requesting an extension of time 
from January 26, 2026, to February 25, 
2026, to submit comments in response 
to the Notice of Inquiry (NOI) in this 
proceeding. NHA states that, given the 
significance of the NOI’s questions to 
the hydropower industry, number of 
questions in the NOI, and the comment 
period falling over the holiday season, 
a 30-day extension will allow 
commenters to evaluate the questions 
posed by the Commission and provide 
comprehensive comments.

NHA asserts 
that the extension will not prejudice any 
interested party. 
Given the request and importance of 
the issues raised by the NOI, upon 
consideration, notice is hereby given 
that the date for submitting comments 
on the NOI is hereby extended to and 
including February 10, 2026.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
[Docket No. OP–1877] 
Request for Information and Comment 
on Reserve Bank Payment Account 
Prototype 
AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 
ACTION: Request for information and comment. 
SUMMARY: The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) seeks 
public input on a special purpose 
Reserve Bank account prototype (a 
Payment Account) tailored to the risks 
and needs of institutions focused on 
payments innovation. A Payment 
Account holder would be expected to 
use its account for the express purpose 
of clearing and settling the institution’s 
payment activity. Payment Accounts 
would be designed to pose limited risk 
to the Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve 
Banks) and the overall payment system, 
and Reserve Banks would generally 
conduct a streamlined review of 
requests for these accounts. Any 
institution that is legally eligible for 
Federal Reserve accounts or services 
(accounts and services) under the 
Federal Reserve Act would be eligible to 
request a Payment Account from a 
Reserve Bank. The Payment Account 
protype does not seek to expand or 
otherwise change legal eligibility for 
access to accounts and services. 
DATES: Comments must be received on or before February 6, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: You may submit comments, identified by Docket No. OP–1877 by

2
Information on the Federal Reserve Banks’ 
financial services, including a list of such services, 
can be found at https://www.frbservices.org. 
3
The Guidelines do not apply to accounts 
provided under fiscal agency authority or to 
accounts authorized pursuant to the Board’s 
Regulation N (12 CFR part 214), joint account 
requests, or account requests from designated 
financial market utilities, since existing rules or 
policies already set out the considerations involved 
in granting these types of accounts. 
4
Some of the Payment Account features and risk 
controls could be the same as utilized for a Master 
Account and are included in this document for 
completeness. 
5
A Payment Account would be technology- 
agnostic and would not be designed to promote any 
particular payment product or service. 
6
As with existing Master Accounts, overnight 
overdrafts would not be permitted in Payment 
Accounts. 
7
A Payment Account would be a separate and 
distinct type of account from a Reserve Bank Joint 
Account. 
8
A Payment Account holder would not be 
eligible to be a participant in an Excess Balance 
Account. 
9
The business day of Federal Reserve Financial 
Services is defined in the Federal Reserve Policy on 
Payment System Risk and begins immediately after 
the close of business of the Fedwire Funds Service 
on days when the Fedwire Funds Service is open 
and the close of the FedNow Service on all other 
days (which, in both cases, is generally 7:00 p.m. 
ET). 
10
The institution’s total assets would be 
determined by its most recent report to its primary 
banking regulator or equivalent. 
statutory developments, and other 
factors drive the introduction of 
innovative approaches to banking 
functions. These innovations necessitate 
adaptation throughout the financial 
sector, including the institutions and 
infrastructure that support a safe and 
efficient payment system. 
On August 15, 2022, after a public 
comment process, the Board adopted 
guidelines (Account Access Guidelines 
or Guidelines) for Reserve Banks to 
utilize in evaluating requests for access 
to accounts and services (access 
requests). The Guidelines establish a 
transparent, risk-based, and consistent 
set of factors for Reserve Banks to use 
in reviewing access requests from 
legally-eligible institutions.
123
The 
Guidelines incorporate a tiering 
framework under which access requests 
from certain types of entities (e.g., non- federally insured institutions) are 
subject to greater due diligence and 
scrutiny than access requests from other 
types of entities (e.g., federally-insured institutions). 
Over the last three years, the business 
models of institutions submitting access 
requests have continued to evolve. For 
example, several institutions have 
explained that they are interested in 
access to accounts and services in order 
to reduce costs to their customers while 
increasing payment processing speed, 
often through new technologies. Some 
of these institutions have requested 
either a state or federal banking charter 
and a few have initiated requests for 
Reserve Bank accounts and services. 
Over the same period, many eligible 
uninsured institutions have requested or 
expressed interest in requesting a master 
account and have expressed concern 
about the length of time that Reserve 
Banks take to review their access 
requests and the likelihood of denial. 
Institutions focused primarily on 
payment activities may only desire 
access to a subset of Federal Reserve 
services through a Reserve Bank 
account. While recognizing that 
decisions on access requests are made at 
the discretion of the individual Reserve 
Banks, the Board is exploring whether a 
tailored, special purpose Payment 
Account could meet these institutions’ 
needs while mitigating material risks 
identified in the Guidelines. 
II. Payment Account Prototype 
The Board is requesting feedback on 
a Payment Account prototype. In 
designing the Payment Account 
prototype, the Board has considered the 
risks identified in the Guidelines (i.e., 
risks to the Reserve Banks, to the overall 
payment system, to financial stability, to 
the overall economy as a result of illicit 
activities, and to the implementation of 
monetary policy). In addition, the Board 
considered features that could limit 
Payment Accounts’ impact on the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. As 
explained further below, Payment 
Accounts would be subject to a common 
set of risk-mitigating features. For 
example, to reduce credit risk to the 
Reserve Banks, a Payment Account 
holder would only have access to 
Federal Reserve payment services that 
have automated controls to prevent the 
accountholder from incurring an 
overdraft. In addition, a Payment 
Account holder would not be eligible 
for discount window access. The 
Reserve Banks would retain their 
discretion to impose additional 
restrictions and risk controls on a 
Payment Account on a case-by-case 
basis. 
A Payment Account would be 
separate and distinct from a full-service 
Reserve Bank master account (Master 
Account).
4
If the Federal Reserve 
decides that the Reserve Banks will offer 
a Payment Account, the Board would 
propose necessary changes to existing 
guidance and regulations, including the 
Guidelines and Regulation D. 
III. Payment Account Term Sheet 
A. Account Description 
a. A Payment Account would be a 
special purpose account with a Reserve 
Bank that holds limited overnight 
balances of a legally-eligible institution 
for the express purpose of clearing and 
settling the institution’s payments.
5
The 
Reserve Bank would permit a Payment 
Account holder to maintain only a 
limited balance in the account at the 
close of business; these end-of-day 
balances would be intended only to 
provide liquidity for payment activity at 
the beginning of the next business day. 
A Payment Account would be a separate 
and distinct type of account from a 
Reserve Bank master account (a Master 
Account), which generally does not 
have a limit imposed on overnight 
balances.
67
The Board would explore 
reporting the balances maintained in 
Payment Accounts separate from 
balances maintained in Master Accounts 
on the Reserve Banks’ financial 
reporting. The Reserve Banks would 
retain their discretion to impose 
additional restrictions and risk controls 
on a Payment Account on a case-by-case 
basis. 
B. Eligibility 
a. Any institution that satisfies the 
legal eligibility requirements for an 
account under the Federal Reserve Act 
would be eligible to request a Payment 
Account. Generally, institutions would 
be limited to maintaining one account 
with a Reserve Bank, either a Payment 
Account or a Master Account.
8
The 
Payment Account prototype would not 
make any changes to legal eligibility for 
access to accounts and services. 
C. Overnight Balance Limit 
a. A Payment Account would be 
subject to an overnight balance limit, 
meaning that a Payment Account holder 
would need to reduce the balance of the 
account below a specified limit at the 
Federal Reserve’s close of business.
9
 
During the Federal Reserve business 
day, a Payment Account holder would 
be allowed to maintain a balance in a 
Payment Account above the overnight 
limit to fund payments settling in the 
account. The Reserve Banks would 
establish a compliance program to 
enforce the overnight balance limit, 
which could include, among other 
options, counseling, penalty fees, and 
service restrictions. 
i. The Board is considering setting the 
overnight balance limit at the lesser of 
$500 million or 10% of the Payment 
Account holder’s total assets.
10
 
ii. The Reserve Bank could have the 
ability to adjust the overnight balance 
limit, temporarily or permanently, on a

A description of the Federal Reserve payment 
services is available at www.frbservices.org. 
12
Free Transfers, as defined in the Reserve Banks’ 
Operating Circular 7 (Fedwire Securities Service), 
are transfers of securities that do not result in a 
debit or a credit to a Master Account other than a 
transaction fee. Free transfers are commonly 
referred to as transfers free of payment. 
13
‘‘Fedwire’’ and ‘‘FedNow’’ are service marks of 
the Federal Reserve Banks. A list of marks related 
to financial services products that are offered to 
financial institutions by the Federal Reserve Banks 
is available at https://www.frbservices.org. 
14
Transfer Against Payment, as defined in the 
Reserve Banks’ Operating Circular 7 (Fedwire 
Securities Service), is a transfer that is affected with 
a credit to the account of the sender and a debit to 
the account of the receiver for the amount of the 
payment. 
15
A Correspondent is a financial institution: (1) 
that has authorized a Reserve Bank to settle Debit 
and Credit Transaction Activity to its Master 
Account for a Respondent or for any financial 
institution for which the Respondent acts as 
Correspondent; or (2) that maintains required 
reserve balances for one or more financial 
institutions in its Master Account. See Section 2.2 of Operating Circular (OC) 1. A Respondent is: (1) 
a financial institution that settles Debit and Credit 
Transaction Activity for some or all its Reserve 
Bank transactions in the Master Account of a 
Correspondent; or (2) a financial institution that 
maintains its required reserve balances in the 
Master Account of a Correspondent. See Section 2.2 of OC 1. 
16
Some of these risk controls may also apply to 
Master Accounts. 
17
Additional due diligence may be required in 
some circumstances, which could require a 
case-by-case basis. In some cases, the 
Reserve Bank would be expected to 
consult with the Board on such an 
adjustment. 
b. As noted above, a Payment Account 
would be designed only to facilitate the 
clearing and settlement of the Payment 
Account holder’s payment activity, and 
this feature would be intended to 
encourage a Payment Account holder to 
limit overnight balances in their 
account. 
D. No Interest on Overnight Balances 
a. A Payment Account holder would 
not receive interest on balances held at 
a Reserve Bank. 
b. As noted above, a Payment Account 
would be designed only to facilitate the 
clearing and settlement of the Payment 
Account holder’s payment activity. This 
feature, along with the overnight 
balance limit, would be intended to 
encourage a Payment Account holder to 
limit overnight balances in their 
account. 
E. No Access to the Discount Window 
a. A Payment Account holder would 
not be permitted to access credit from 
the discount window. 
b. This feature would be intended to 
reduce the credit risk that a Payment 
Account holder could pose to the 
Reserve Bank. 
F. No Access to Reserve Bank Intraday 
Credit 
a. A Reserve Bank provides intraday 
credit, also known as a daylight 
overdraft, when an institution’s Federal 
Reserve account is in a negative position 
during the business day. An institution 
with a Payment Account would not be 
permitted to incur daylight overdrafts. 
Payments would need to be prefunded 
and as noted below, payments that 
would cause an overdraft in a Payment 
Account would be rejected. 
b. This feature would be intended to 
reduce the credit risk that a Payment 
Account could pose to the Reserve 
Bank. 
G. Services Available 
a. The following services (collectively, 
the permitted services) would be 
available for an institution to request to 
settle in a Payment Account:
11
 
i. The Fedwire

Funds Service; 
ii. The National Settlement Service; 
iii. The FedNow

Service; and 
iv. The Fedwire

Securities Service 
for Free Transfers only.
12 13
 
b. This feature would be intended to 
reduce the credit risk that a Payment 
Account could pose to the Reserve 
Bank. Limiting Payment Accounts to 
these services would reduce credit risk 
to the Reserve Banks since each of these 
services have automated solutions that 
can reject transactions that would cause 
daylight overdrafts. As noted above, 
Payment Account holders would not be 
permitted to incur daylight overdrafts. 
H. Services Not Available 
a. Any services not listed above 
(collectively, the excluded services) 
would not be available in connection 
with a Payment Account, including: 
i. FedACH

Services; 
ii. Check Services; 
iii. FedCash

; and 
iv. The Fedwire

Securities Service 
for Transfer Against Payment.
14
 
b. This feature would be intended to 
reduce the credit risk that a Payment 
Account could pose to the Reserve 
Bank. These services would not be 
available because they do not currently 
have automated solutions that can reject 
transactions that would cause daylight 
overdrafts. As noted above, Payment 
Account holders would not be 
permitted to incur daylight overdrafts. 
I. Account Usage Restrictions 
a. A Payment Account would be 
designed as a special purpose account 
for the express purpose of clearing and 
settling the institution’s payment 
activity. Accordingly, a Payment 
Account holder would not be permitted 
to act as a correspondent bank, and a 
Payment Account could not be used to 
settle transactions for respondent 
institutions.
15
This feature would be 
intended to reduce the range of risks a 
Payment Account could pose to the 
Reserve Bank and the overall payment 
system. 
b. In addition, consistent with the 
Reserve Banks’ current practice for 
Master Accounts, the Reserve Banks 
would not recognize third-party 
interests in Payment Accounts. Like 
Master Account balances, the Reserve 
Banks would treat all balances in a 
Payment Account solely as obligations 
to the account holder. 
J. Other Risk Controls 
a. In addition to the foregoing risk 
mitigants, the Reserve Banks would 
apply the following risk controls to a 
Payment Account:
16
 
i. Outgoing transactions that would 
result in an overdraft in the account 
would be rejected. This feature is 
intended to reduce the potential credit 
risk a Payment Account could pose to 
the Reserve Bank. As noted above, 
Payment Account holders would not be 
permitted to incur daylight overdrafts. 
b. The Board is exploring additional 
risk controls and conditions for a 
Payment Account. These controls could 
take the form of, among other things, 
account agreement conditions, 
attestation requirements, consent to 
reviews, or periodic reporting 
requirements. These controls could 
cover areas of risks to the Reserve Bank 
and payment system (such as 
operational or cyber risks), or risks 
associated with illicit financing (such as 
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) risk 
mitigation). 
K. Payment Account Request Process 
a. An eligible institution would 
request a Payment Account from the 
relevant Reserve Bank. The relevant 
Reserve Bank would have the discretion 
to approve or deny the request. Similar 
to requests for Master Accounts, Reserve 
Banks would be expected to review a 
request for a Payment Account under 
the Guidelines. 
b. Consistent with a Payment 
Account’s lower risk profile, the Board 
anticipates that a request for a Payment 
Account would generally receive a more 
streamlined review than a request for a 
Master Account from a comparable 
institution. As a result, a Reserve Bank 
would generally be expected to 
complete its review of an institution’s 
request for a Payment Account within 
90 calendar days of receiving all 
documentation requested by the Reserve 
Bank.

Bank to review the request, and the Reserve Bank 
would be expected to consult with the Board on 
such an adjustment. The Board may set a limit on 
the additional review time. Thus, the 90-day review 
might be extended in some cases. 
c. As noted above, the Reserve Banks 
would retain their discretion to impose 
additional restrictions and risk controls 
on a Payment Account on a case-by-case 
basis. 
IV. Request for Information 
The Board requests public input on 
all aspects of the Payment Account 
prototype, and in particular the Board 
seeks responses to the following 
questions: 
1. Would the design of the Payment 
Account prototype support payment 
activities of eligible institutions? 
2. What payment activities or use 
cases would a Payment Account best 
facilitate (or be unable to facilitate)? 
3. What barriers to innovation in 
payments would a Payment Account 
eliminate or alleviate? 
4. Would the design of the Payment 
Account prototype potentially increase 
the range of risks to the payment system 
identified in the Guidelines? If so, in 
what ways? 
5. What are the benefits and 
challenges of imposing an overnight 
balance limit on a Payment Account? 
Are there adjustments to the proposed 
formula for setting the balance limit that 
the Board should consider if it decides 
to establish a Payment Account? 
6. What are the benefits and 
drawbacks of paying no interest on 
overnight balances in a Payment 
Account? 
7. How might the Federal Reserve 
condition access to a Payment Account 
on the applicant having an acceptable 
AML, Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and 
Countering the Financing of Terrorism 
(CFT) compliance programs and, more 
generally, how can the Federal Reserve 
best constrain AML/BSA/CFT risks 
associated with a Payment Account? 
8. Are there additional features or 
limits that the Board should consider in 
the design of the Payment Account 
prototype? 
By order of the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System.

Analysis of Agreement Containing 
Consent Order To Aid Public Comment 
I. Introduction 
The Federal Trade Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’) has accepted, subject to 
final approval, an Agreement 
Containing Consent Order (‘‘Consent 
Agreement’’) with Adamas Amenity 
Services LLC, Adamas Building Services 
LLC, Adamas Concierge LLC, Adamas 
Parking Services LLC, and Adamas 
Security LLC (collectively, 
‘‘Respondents’’). The proposed Decision 
and Order (‘‘Order’’), included in the 
Consent Agreement and subject to final 
Commission approval, is designed to 
remedy the anticompetitive effects that 
have resulted from Respondents’ use of 
restrictive covenants in some of their 
contracts with building owners and 
managers that limit the ability of those 
building owners and managers to solicit 
or hire Respondents’ employees (‘‘No- 
Hire Agreements’’). The term No-Hire 
Agreement refers to a term in an 
agreement between two or more 
companies that restricts, imposes 
conditions on, or otherwise limits a 
company’s ability to solicit, recruit, or 
hire another company’s employees, 
during employment or afterwards, 
directly or indirectly, including by 
imposing a fee or damages in 
connection with such conduct, or that 
otherwise inhibits competition between 
companies for each other’s employees’ 
services. 
The Consent Agreement settles 
charges that Respondents have engaged 
in unfair methods of competition in 
violation of section 5 of the FTC Act, as 
amended, 15 U.S.C. 45 (‘‘section 5 of the 
FTC Act’’), by entering into No-Hire 
Agreements with customers. 
Respondents’ No-Hire Agreements 
constitute unreasonable restraints of 
trade that are unlawful under section 1 
of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1, and are 
thus unfair methods of competition in 
violation of section 5of the FTC Act. 
Independent of the Sherman Act, 
Respondents’ use of the No-Hire 
Agreements constitutes an unfair 
method of competition with a tendency 
or likelihood to harm competition, 
consumers, and employees in the 
building services industry, in violation 
of section 5 of the FTC Act. 
The proposed Order has been placed 
on the public record for 30 days in order 
to receive comments from interested 
persons. Comments received during this 
period will become part of the public 
record. After 30 days, the Commission 
will again review the Consent 
Agreement, and the comments received, 
and will decide whether it should 
withdraw from the Consent Agreement

proposed Order final. 
II. The Respondents 
Respondents are building services 
contractors headquartered in 
Rutherford, New Jersey that provide 
building maintenance, janitorial, 
concierge, valet, and security services. 
Respondent Adamas Amenity Services 
LLC provides services relating to 
residential building amenities such as 
pool and fitness facilities. Respondent 
Adamas Building Services LLC provides 
janitorial and maintenance services. 
Respondent Adamas Concierge LLC 
handles front desk, doorman, and lobby 
attendant services. Respondent Adamas 
Parking LLC provides parking garage 
and valet services. Respondent Adamas 
Security LLC handles unarmed security 
services. A substantial majority of 
Respondents’ work relates to residential 
buildings. 
III. The Complaint 
The complaint alleges that 
Respondents sell building services to 
building owners and property 
management companies, primarily 
consisting of the labor of janitors, 
security guards, maintenance workers, 
and concierge desk workers who are 
directly employed by Respondents. 
These employees perform their work 
predominantly in New Jersey and New 
York City. 
The complaint also alleges that 
Respondents and their building owner 
and property manager customers are 
direct competitors in labor markets for 
building services workers. These 
include the markets for workers to 
perform concierge, security, janitorial, 
maintenance, and related services. 
As alleged in the complaint, 
Respondents use standard-form 
agreements with their customers that 
include No-Hire Agreements. The No- 
Hire Agreements restrict the ability of 
Respondents’ customers to (1) directly 
hire workers employed by Respondents 
and (2) indirectly hire workers 
employed by Respondents through a 
competing building services contractor 
after the competitor wins the customers’ 
business away from Respondents. These 
restrictions apply during the term of 
Respondents’ contracts and for six 
months thereafter. The restrictions 
against hiring apply not just to 
Respondents’ employees staffed to 
provide services for a particular 
customer, but to all of Respondents’ 
building services employees. 
The complaint alleges that 
Respondents’ No-Hire Agreements are 
anticompetitive because they eliminate 
direct, horizontal, and significant forms 
of competition to attract labor in the 
U.S. building services industry. These 
agreements deny employees access to 
job opportunities, restrict their mobility, 
and deprive them of competitively 
significant information that they could 
have used to negotiate for better terms 
of employment. The complaint further 
alleges that any legitimate objectives of 
Respondents’ conduct could have been 
achieved through significantly less 
restrictive means. Among other terms, 
the scope and duration of the No-Hire 
Agreements are not reasonably 
necessary to achieve any claimed pro- 
competitive purpose of Respondents’ 
building services contracts. For these 
reasons, the complaint alleges that the 
No-Hire Agreements constitute 
unreasonable restraints of trade that 
violate section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 
U.S.C. 1, and are thus unfair methods of 
competition in violation of section 5 of 
the FTC Act. 
Independent of the Sherman Act, the 
complaint alleges that Respondents’ 
conduct constitutes an unfair method of 
competition with a tendency or 
likelihood to harm competition, 
consumers, and employees in the 
building services industry, in violation 
of section 5 of the FTC Act. According 
to the complaint, the No-Hire 
Agreements limit the ability of building 
owners and competing building service 
contractors to hire Respondents’ 
employees. This harms Respondents’ 
employees because it limits their ability 
to negotiate for higher wages, better 
benefits, and improved working 
conditions. Employees may suffer 
further hardship if the building they 
work at changes management, because 
the No-Hire Agreements force them to 
leave their jobs in some circumstances. 
The complaint further alleges that the 
No-Hire Agreements harm building 
owners and managers because they may 
be foreclosed from seeking or accepting 
bids from Respondents’ competitors due 
to the prospect of losing long-serving 
workers with extensive, building- 
specific experience. 
IV. Proposed Order 
The proposed Order seeks to remedy 
Respondents’ unfair methods of 
competition. Section II of the proposed 
Order prohibits Respondents from 
entering or attempting to enter, 
maintaining or attempting to maintain, 
enforcing or attempting to enforce, or 
threatening to enforce a No-Hire 
Agreement, or communicating to a 
customer or any other person that any 
Adamas employee is subject to a No- 
Hire Agreement. 
Paragraph III.A of the proposed Order 
requires Respondents to provide written 
notice to customers that are subject to 
No-Hire Agreements that (i) the 
restriction is null and void, and (ii) any 
customer or a subsequent building 
services contractor for a customer is no 
longer subject to the restrictions or 
penalties related to the No-Hire 
Agreements in Respondents’ contracts. 
Paragraph III.B of the proposed Order 
requires Respondents to provide written 
notices to employees who are subject to 
a No-Hire Agreement. Paragraph III.C 
requires that Respondents post clear and 
conspicuous notice that employees are 
not subject to No-Hire Agreements and 
may seek or accept a job with the 
building directly, or any company that 
wins the building’s business. 
Paragraphs IV.A and IV.B of the 
proposed Order require that 
Respondents immediately cease 
enforcing No-Hire Agreements and, 
within 30 days after the Order is issued, 
provide key employees of Respondents 
with a copy of the Order and Complaint. 
Paragraphs IV.C–E set forth 
Respondents’ ongoing compliance 
obligations. 
Other paragraphs contain standard 
provisions regarding compliance 
reports, requirements for Respondents 
to provide notice to the FTC of material 
changes to their business, and access for 
the FTC to documents and personnel. 
The term of the proposed Order is ten 
years. 
The purpose of this analysis is to 
facilitate public comment on the 
Consent Agreement and proposed Order 
to aid the Commission in determining 
whether it should make the proposed 
Order final. This analysis is not an 
official interpretation of the proposed 
Order and does not modify its terms in 
any way. 
By direction of the Commission. 
April J. Tabor, 
Secretary.

Abstract: As required by section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 
3506(c)(2)(A), the FTC is providing this 
opportunity for public comment before 
requesting that the Office of 
Management and Budget (‘‘OMB’’) 
extend the existing clearance for the 
information collection requirements 
contained in the Affiliate Marketing 
Rule. 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 
and Consumer Protection Act (‘‘Dodd- 
Frank Act’’) was enacted on July 21, 
2010.
1
The Dodd-Frank Act transferred 
to the CFPB most of the FTC’s 
rulemaking authority for the Affiliate 
Marketing provisions of the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act (‘‘FCRA’’).
2
The FTC 
retained rulemaking authority for its 
Affiliate Marketing Rule (16 CFR part 
680) solely for motor vehicle dealers 
described in section 1029(a) of the 
Dodd-Frank Act as predominantly 
engaged in the sale and servicing of 
motor vehicles, the leasing and 
servicing of motor vehicles, or both.
3
 
Additionally, the FTC shares 
enforcement authority with the CFPB 
and other agencies for provisions of 
Regulation V subpart C (12 CFR 
1022.20–1022.27) that apply to entities 
other than those specified above.
4
 
As mandated by section 214 of the 
Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions 
Act (‘‘FACT Act’’), Public Law 108–159 
(Dec. 6, 2003), the Affiliate Marketing 
Rule (‘‘Rule’’) requires covered entities 
to provide consumers with notice and 
an opportunity to opt out of the use of 
certain information before sending 
marketing solicitations. The Rule 
generally provides that, if a company 
communicates certain information about 
a consumer (eligibility information) to 
an affiliate, the affiliate may not use it 
to make or send solicitations to the 
consumer unless the consumer is given 
notice and a reasonable opportunity to 
opt out of such use of the information 
and does not opt out. 
To minimize compliance costs and 
burdens for entities, particularly any 
small businesses that may be affected, 
the Rule contains model disclosures and 
opt-out notices that may be used to 
satisfy the statutory requirements. The 
Rule also gives covered entities 
flexibility to satisfy the notice and opt- 
out requirement. Covered entities may 
send the consumer a free-standing opt- 
out notice to satisfy the Rule’s 
requirements or add the opt-out notice 
to privacy notices already provided to 
consumers, such as those provided in 
accordance with the provisions of Title 
V, subtitle A of the Gramm Leach Bliley 
Act (‘‘GLBA’’).
5
As a result, the time 
necessary to prepare or incorporate an 
opt-out notice is likely to be minimal 
because covered entities may either use 
the model disclosure verbatim or base 
their own disclosures upon it. 
Moreover, verbatim adoption of the 
model notice does not constitute a PRA 
‘‘collection of information.’’
6
The Rule 
also provides that affiliated companies 
may send a joint disclosure to 
consumers, thereby eliminating the 
need for each affiliate to send a separate 
disclosure. Staff anticipates that 
affiliated entities will choose to send a 
joint notice, which will reduce the 
number of notices required under the 
Rule. 
Burden Statement 
Under the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501–3521, 
the FTC is requesting that OMB renew 
the clearance (OMB Control Number 
3084–0131) for the information 
collection burden associated with the 
Rule. Staff estimates that there are 
approximately 47,057 franchise/new car 
and independent/used car dealers in the 
U.S.
7
Applying an estimated rate of 
affiliation of 16.75%, staff estimates that 
there are approximately 7,882 motor 
vehicle dealerships in affiliated families 
that may be subject to the Rule’s affiliate 
sharing obligations. Staff further 
estimates an average of five businesses 
per family or affiliated relationship, and 
anticipates that affiliated entities will 
choose to send a joint notice as 
permitted by the Rule. Therefore, staff 
estimates that approximately 1,576 
covered motor vehicle business families 
would be subject to the Rule. 
Staff assumes that all or nearly all 
motor vehicles subject to the Rule’s 
provisions are also subject to the 
Commission’s Privacy of Consumer 
Financial Information Rule under the 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (16 CFR part 
313) (‘‘Privacy Rule’’). Entities that are 
subject to the Commission’s GLBA 
Privacy Rule already provide privacy 
notices to their customers. Absent an 
exception, financial institutions must 
provide an initial privacy notice at the 
time the customer relationship is 
established and then annually so long as

Support’’ for clerical workers. See National employment and wage data from the Occupational 
Employment and Wage Statistics survey by 
occupation, May 2024, U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, last modified April 2, 2025: https://

6803. Staff’s estimates assume that in all 
or nearly all cases covered institutions 
will choose to incorporate the affiliate 
marketing opt-out notice into the initial 
and annual GLBA privacy notices. In 
2015, Congress, as part of the FAST Act, 
amended the GLBA to provide an 
exception under which financial 
institutions that meet certain conditions 
are not required to provide annual 
notices to customers.
8
Staff seeks 
comment on how the use of this 
exception by institutions that are 
required to provide an affiliate 
marketing notice will impact the burden 
estimates for these entities. Institutions 
that claim the FAST Act exemption and 
forego sending required annual privacy 
notices in some years will nonetheless 
be required to send a separate affiliate 
marketing notice to comply with their 
obligations under the Rule. 
Staff estimates that the 1,576 covered 
motor vehicle business families will 
spend on average about 5 hours per year 
to comply with the Affiliate Sharing 
Rule beyond their separate obligations 
under the Privacy Rule, yielding a total 
annual hours of burden of 7,880 hours. 
Staff’s estimates take into account the 
time necessary to determine compliance 
obligations; create the notice and opt- 
out, in either paper or electronic form; 
and disseminate the notice and opt-out. 
Staff’s estimates presume that the 
availability of model disclosures and 
opt-out notices will simplify the 
compliance review and implementation 
processes, thereby significantly 
reducing the compliance burden. 
Staff estimates the associated labor 
cost by adding the hourly mean private 
sector wages for managerial, technical, 
and clerical work and multiplying that 
sum by the estimated number of hours. 
The private sector hourly wages for 
these classifications are $68.15, $56.16, 
and $24.12, respectively.
9
Estimated 
hours spent for each category are 2, 2, 
and 1, respectively. Multiplying each 
occupation’s hourly wage by the 
associated time estimate, yields the 
annual labor cost burden per respondent 
which is then multiplied by the 
estimated number of respondents to 
determine the cumulative annual labor 
cost burden: $429,838 per year.

Because the FACT Act and the Rule 
contemplate that the affiliate marketing 
notice can be included in the GLBA 
notices, the capital and non-labor cost 
burden on regulated entities would be 
greatly reduced. Covered entities 
typically already provide notices to 
their customers so there are no new 
capital or non-labor costs, as the affiliate 
marketing notice may be consolidated 
into their annual privacy notice. Thus, 
staff estimates that any capital or non- 
labor costs associated with compliance 
for these entities are de minimis.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
FDA is announcing the availability of 
a guidance for industry entitled ‘‘Formal 
Dispute Resolution and Administrative 
Hearings of Final Administrative Orders 
Under Section 505G of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.’’ This 
guidance provides recommendations for 
industry and review staff on the FDR 
and administrative hearings procedures 
for resolving scientific and/or medical 
disputes between CDER and requestors 
and sponsors of drugs that will be 
subject to a Final Order under section 
505G of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 355h). 
Section 505G of the FD&C Act was 
added by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
and Economic Security Act (CARES 
Act) (Pub. L. 116–136), which was 
enacted on March 27, 2020. After FDA 
issues a Final Order in accordance with 
section 505G(b)(2) of the FD&C Act, 
FDA must afford eligible requestors or 
sponsors the opportunity for FDR and 
hearings on disputes over the Final 
Order. This guidance describes the FDR 
procedures for eligible requestors or 
sponsors that wish to appeal a scientific 
and/or medical issue related to a Final 
Order. This guidance also outlines the 
procedures for an administrative 
hearing related to a Final Order. Finally, 
as required by section 505G(l)(4) of the 
FD&C Act, this guidance describes the 
procedures for consolidated proceedings 
for FDR and hearings to resolve the 
scientific and/or medical disputes. 
FDA agreed to specific performance 
goals and procedures described in the 
document ‘‘Over-the-Counter 
Monograph User Fee Program 
Performance Goals and Procedures— 
Fiscal Years 2018–2022,’’ commonly 
referred to as the OMUFA commitment 
letter (the document can be accessed at 
https://www.fda.gov/media/106407/ 
download, and the document with updated goal dates for fiscal years 2021– 
2025 can be accessed at https://
www.fda.gov/media/146283/download). 
The OMUFA commitment letter 
specifies that FDA will revise the 
guidance for industry and review staff 
entitled ‘‘Formal Dispute Resolution: 
Sponsor Appeals Above the Division 
Level’’ (existing FDR guidance), 
available at https://www.fda.gov/media/ 
126910/download, to include circumstances and procedures under 
which FDR may be used with respect to

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60106 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Notices Final Orders under section 505G of the 
FD&C Act. In addition, consistent with 
the statutory requirement under section 
505G(l)(4), the OMUFA commitment 
letter explains that FDA will issue 
guidance on its views regarding best 
practices for consolidated proceedings 
for appeals. 
For administrative efficiency, rather 
than amend the existing FDR guidance 
to include FDR procedures for Final 
Orders and issue a separate guidance for 
consolidated proceedings for appeals, 
FDA is issuing this single guidance. 
This guidance addresses the process for 
resolving scientific and/or medical 
disputes of Final Orders, including FDR, 
administrative hearings, and 
consolidated proceedings. FDA has 
incorporated recommendations from the 
existing FDR guidance as appropriate. 
This guidance finalizes the draft 
guidance entitled ‘‘Formal Dispute 
Resolution and Administrative Hearings 
of Final Administrative Orders Under 
Section 505G of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act’’ issued on June 23, 
2023 (88 FR 41107). FDA considered 
comments received on the draft 
guidance as the guidance was finalized. 
Changes from the draft guidance to the 
final guidance include: (1) clarifying 
that the recommendations in this 
guidance are limited to FDR in 
accordance with section 
505G(b)(2)(A)(iv)(III) and 
505G(b)(4)(D)(iii) of the FD&C Act and 
to hearings in accordance with section 
505G(b)(3) of the FD&C Act, and (2) 
removing language implying that new 
information could be submitted outside 
of, but at the same time or during, the 
FDR to avoid any suggestion that an 
eligible requestor or sponsor submitting 
a request for FDR should actively engage 
with other entities within FDA or 
pursue other regulatory or legal 
pathways on the same matter at the 
same time. 
This guidance is being issued 
consistent with FDA’s good guidance 
practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115). 
The guidance represents the current 
thinking of FDA on ‘‘Formal Dispute 
Resolution and Administrative Hearings 
of Final Administrative Orders Under 
Section 505G of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act.’’ It does not establish 
any rights for any person and is not 
binding on FDA or the public. You can 
use an alternative approach if it satisfies 
the requirements of the applicable 
statutes and regulations. FDA 
considered the applicability of 
Executive Order 14192, per Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) 
guidance in M–25–20, and finds this 
action to be deregulatory in nature. 
II. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
Under section 505G(o) of the FD&C 
Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995 (PRA) does not apply to 
collections of information made under 
section 505G of the FD&C Act. The 
information collections made in this 
guidance implement the provisions of 
the following subsections of 505G: 
(1) Section 505G(l)(4), which requires 
FDA to issue guidance that specifies the 
consolidated proceedings for appeal and 
the procedures for such proceedings 
where appropriate; 
(2) Section 505G(b)(2)(A)(iv)(III), 
which requires that FDA afford 
requesters of drugs that will be subject 
to final administrative orders the 
opportunity for FDR up to the level of 
the Director of CDER; 
(3) Section 505G(b)(3) and section 
505G(b)(4)(E), which allow persons who 
participated in each stage of FDR with 
respect to a drug to request a hearing 
concerning a final administrative order 
with respect to such drug. Under section 
505G(b)(3)(C)(ii), a single hearing may 
be conducted if more than one request 
is submitted with respect to the same 
administrative order; and 
(4) Section 505G(j), which requires 
that all submissions be in electronic 
format. 
Therefore, clearance by OMB under 
the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501–3521) is not 
required for these collections of 
information. 
In addition, this guidance refers to 
previously approved FDA collections of 
information. The previously approved 
collections of information are subject to 
review by OMB under the PRA. The 
collections of information for over-the- 
counter (OTC) monograph products, 
OTC monograph order requests, and the 
OTC Monograph User Fee Program have 
been approved under OMB control 
number 0910–0340. The collections of 
information for FDR have been 
approved under OMB control number 
0910–0001. The collections of 
information in 21 CFR 10.65 relating to 
meetings and correspondence have been 
approved under OMB control number 
0910–0191.

Extension 
This information collection supports 
FDA regulations. Section 522 of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(21 U.S.C. 360l) authorizes FDA to 
require a manufacturer to conduct 
postmarket surveillance (PS) of any 
device that meets the criteria set forth in 
the statute. The PS regulation 
establishes procedures that FDA uses to 
approve and disapprove PS plans. The 
regulation provides instructions to 
manufacturers, so they know what 
information is required in a PS plan 
submission. FDA reviews PS plan 
submissions in accordance with 21 CFR 
822.15 through 822.19 of the regulation, 
which describe the grounds for 
approving or disapproving a PS plan. In 
addition, the PS regulation provides 
instructions to manufacturers to submit 
interim and final reports in accordance 
with 21 CFR 822.38. To assist 
respondents with understanding the 
applicable statutory and regulatory 
requirements, we also developed the 
interpretive agency guidance entitled, 
‘‘Postmarket Surveillance Under Section 
522 of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act’’ (October 2022) (available 
at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory- information/search-fda-guidance- 
documents/postmarket-surveillance-

and-cosmetic-act). Respondents to this 
collection of information are those 
manufacturers that require PS of their 
products. 
In the Federal Register of June 6, 2025 
(90 FR 25318) FDA published a 60-day 
notice requesting public comment on 
the proposed collection of information. 
No comments were received.

for Strategic Preparedness and 
Response—Center for Industrial Base 
Management and Supply Chain. 
Abstract 
HHS, Administration for Strategic 
Preparedness and Response (ASPR) is 
seeking approval by OMB on an 
extension of the existing clearance 
(OMB Control Number: 0990–0488, 
Expiration Date: March 31, 2026). HHS 
is working with the White House and 
across the federal interagency to launch 
a multiyear implementation involving 
the identification and coordination of 
measurable activities across the United 
States government, state, local, tribal, 
and territorial (SLTT) jurisdictions, and 
private sector partners. Cross-sectoral 
engagement is the underpinning of 
many of the interdependent 
implementation activities. For example, 
one such activity involves information 
collection from SLTT partners on 
facility, local, and state stockpiling 
plans to ensure coordinated plans are in 
place for a future public health 
emergency. Potential engagements 
include, and are not limited to, surveys, 
stakeholder meetings, requests for 
information (RFI), town hall meetings, 
and workshops. With each of these 
different mechanisms of engagement, 
there is a varied frequency ranging from 
single engagements to regularly 
recurring meetings. 
In 2025, the White House capacity 
and strengthening the public health 
supply chain through a series of 
executive actions focused on reducing 
foreign dependency, enhancing 
domestic manufacturing capacity, and 
improving emergency preparedness. 
This includes the establishment of the 
Strategic Active Pharmaceutical 
Ingredients Reserve (SAPIR), directed by 
HHS and managed through ASPR, to 
ensure a secure, domestic supply of 
essential drug components. The 
administration has also invoked Section 
232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 
to assess whether reliance on imports of 
materials such as processed critical 
minerals and copper poses a national 
security risk, including risks to the 
production of pharmaceuticals and 
other medical countermeasures. These 
coordinated efforts reflect a broader 
federal strategy to increase the 
resilience, agility, and visibility of the 
public health supply chain in support of 
future emergency response operations. 
To support White House priorities, HHS 
seeks a 3-year extension to its 
Paperwork Reduction Act clearance and 
will engage with SLTT, trade groups, 
mixed cross-sector audiences, non- 
governmental organizations, 
manufacturers, academia, healthcare 
providers and facilities, and local 
communities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Introduction 
On December 4, 2025, the Department 
of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
issued the HHS Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) Strategy
1
in response to Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) 
Memorandum 25–21.
2
The HHS AI 
Strategy represents a ‘‘OneHHS’’ 
approach to AI and is primarily focused 
on the Department’s internal interests 
and ambitions to harness the 
transformative potential of AI and 
embed it into HHS’s operations, while 
upholding patient privacy, civil rights, 
and civil liberties. Consistent with the 
President’s artificial intelligence (AI) 
Action Plan,
3
recent Executive Orders
4
 
on AI, and Office of Management and 
Budget AI memoranda,
5
the Department 
seeks public feedback on the actions it 
can take to establish a forward-leaning, 
industry-supportive, and secure 
approach to accelerate the adoption and 
use of AI
6
as part of clinical care. In the 
past 12 months, HHS Divisions, 
including the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA),
7
National 
Institutes of Health (NIH),
8
Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),
9
 
and ASTP/ONC
10
have sought public 
feedback on various aspects of AI and 
how it intersects with the Department’s 
policy interests. In this RFI we seek 
concrete, experience-based feedback 
from those building, buying, evaluating, 
using, and receiving care from AI tools 
that are part of clinical care as well as 
from those who wish to do so but face 
barriers. Public feedback will inform 
HHS-wide use of three different 
approaches: regulation, reimbursement, 
and research & development. In general, 
HHS seeks feedback on ways in which 
these approaches can be most effectively 
applied to support the rapid adoption 
and use of AI in clinical care, to foster 
public trust and confidence in modern 
technology solutions, to reduce 
uncertainty that impedes AI innovation, 
and to align federal incentives so that AI 
is deployed in ways that enhance 
productivity, reduce burden, lower 
health care costs, and improve health 
outcomes for patients, caregivers, and 
communities. 
II. Solicitation of Public Comments 
Regulation 
As the nation’s principal health 
regulator, HHS helps shape the 
environment in which AI for clinical 
care is developed, evaluated, and 
deployed. HHS seeks to establish a 
regulatory posture on AI that is well 
understood, predictable, and 
proportionate to any risks presented to 
enable rapid innovation while 
protecting patients and the 
confidentiality of their identifiable 
health information, and maintaining 
public trust. We seek feedback on how 
current HHS regulations impact AI 
adoption and use for clinical care. 
Reimbursement 
HHS’s payment policies and programs 
have massive effects on how health care 
is delivered in the United States, often 
times with unintended consequences. 
Hypothetically, if a payer is taking 
financial risk for the long-term health 
and health costs of an individual, that 
payer will have an inherent incentive to 
promote access to the highest-value 
interventions for patients. Under 
government designed and dictated fee- 
for-service regimes, however, coverage 
and reimbursement decisions are slow. 
Rarely does covering new innovations 
reduce net spending; and waste, fraud, 
and abuse is difficult to prevent, often 
times leading to massive spending 
bubbles on concentrated items or 
services that are not commensurate with 
the value of such products. Given the 
inherent flaws in legacy payment 
systems, we seek to ensure that the 
potential promises of AI innovations are 
not diminished through inertia and 
instead such payment systems are 
modernized to meet the needs of a 
changing healthcare system. We seek 
feedback on payment policy changes 
that ensure payers have the incentive 
and ability to promote access to high-

competition among clinical care AI tool 
builders, and accelerate access to and 
affordability of AI tools for clinical care. 
Research & Development 
HHS supports one of the world’s 
largest health research ecosystems, 
catalyzing innovation to supplement the 
market. By enabling applied AI research 
& development, care delivery research 
and implementation science, as well as 
AI entrepreneurship in health care, we 
can better translate AI technologies from 
concept to clinical use. We seek input 
on ways in which HHS may invest in 
research & development (including 
public-private partnerships and 
cooperative research and development 
agreements (CRADAs)) to integrate AI in 
care delivery and create new, long-term 
market opportunities that improve the 
health and wellbeing of all Americans. 
Specific Questions 
In addition to the general requests for 
information above regarding AI 
regulation, reimbursement, and research 
& development, HHS seeks input on the 
following specific questions: 
1. What are the biggest barriers to 
private sector innovation in AI for 
health care and its adoption and use in 
clinical care? 
2. What regulatory, payment policy, 
or programmatic design changes should 
HHS prioritize to incentivize the 
effective use of AI in clinical care and 
why? What HHS regulations, policies, or 
programs could be revisited to augment 
your ability to develop or use AI in 
clinical care? Please provide specific 
changes and applicable Code of Federal 
Regulations citations. 
3. For non-medical devices, we 
understand that use of AI in clinical 
care may raise novel legal and 
implementation issues that challenge 
existing governance and accountability 
structures (e.g., relating to liability, indemnification, privacy, and security). 
What novel legal and implementation 
issues exist and what role, if any, 
should HHS play to help address them? 
4. For non-medical devices, what are 
the most promising AI evaluation 
methods (pre- and post-deployment), 
metrics, robustness testing, and other 
workflow and human-centered 
evaluation methods for clinical care? 
Should HHS further support these 
processes? If so, which mechanisms 
would be most impactful (e.g., contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, and/or 
prize competitions)? 
5. How can HHS best support private 
sector activities (e.g., accreditation, certification, industry-driven testing, 
and credentialing) to promote 
innovative and effective AI use in 
clinical care? 
6. Where have AI tools deployed in 
clinical care met or exceeded 
performance and cost expectations and 
where have they fallen short? What 
kinds of novel AI tools would have the 
greatest potential to improve health care 
outcomes, give new insights on quality, 
and help reduce costs? 
7. Which role(s), decision maker(s), or 
governing bodies within health care 
organizations have the most influence 
on the adoption of AI for clinical care? 
What are the primary administrative 
hurdles to the adoption of AI in clinical 
care? 
8. Where would enhanced 
interoperability widen market 
opportunities, fuel research, and 
accelerate the development of AI for 
clinical care? Please consider specific 
data types, data standards, and 
benchmarking tools. 
9. What challenges within health care 
do patients and caregivers wish to see 
addressed by the adoption and use of AI 
in clinical care? Equally, what concerns 
do patients and caregivers have related 
to the adoption and use of AI in clinical 
care? 
10. Are there specific areas of AI 
research that HHS should prioritize to 
accelerate the adoption of AI as part of 
clinical care? 
a. Are there published findings about 
the impact of adopted AI tools and their 
use clinical care? 
b. How does the literature approach 
the costs, benefits, and transfers of using 
AI as part of clinical care? 
III. Paperwork Reduction Act

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60112 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Notices This technology describes modified T 
cell therapeutics that have reduced 
expression of one or a combination of 
transmembrane adaptor proteins SIT1, 
LAX1 and TRAT1. T cell-based 
therapeutics such as ex vivo expanded 
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) 
and chimeric antigen receptor T-cells 
(CAR–T) have clinical utility against a 
limited number of solid tumor types, 
most notably, melanoma. However, to 
date, efficacy in patients has been 
limited due to several factors. The 
subject invention potentially addresses 
the limited efficacy of T cell 
therapeutics by reducing expression of 
SIT1, LAX1 and/or TRAT1 which leads 
to enhanced T cell cytotoxic activity 
against tumor cells. 
This Notice is made in accordance 
with 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR part 404. 
The prospective exclusive license will 
be royalty bearing, and the prospective

U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR part 404. 
Complete applications for a license 
that are timely filed in response to this 
notice will be treated as objections to 
the grant of the contemplated exclusive 
patent license. In response to this 
Notice, the public may file comments or 
objections. Comments and objections, 
other than those in the form of a license 
application, will not be treated 
confidentially, and may be made

Programs Federal Drug Testing Custody 
and Control Form (CCF) (OMB No. 
0930–0158) and National Laboratory 
Certification Program (NLCP) 
Information Collection Tools—Revision 
SAMHSA will request OMB approval 
for revision of the Federal Drug Testing 
Custody and Control Form (CCF) for 
federal agency and federally regulated 
drug testing programs which must 
comply with the HHS Mandatory 
Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug 
Testing Programs using Urine (UrMG) 
dated October 12, 2023 (88 FR 70768) 
and using Oral Fluid (OFMG) dated 
October 12, 2023 (88 FR 70814), and 
OMB approval for information provided 
by test facilities (laboratories and 
Instrumented Initial Test Facilities, 
IITFs) for the National Laboratory 
Certification Program (NLCP). 
The CCF is used by all federal 
agencies and by employers regulated by 
the Department of Transportation (DOT) 
and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
(NRC) to document the collection and 
chain of custody of a urine or oral fluid 
specimen at the collection site, for HHS- 
certified test facilities to document 
chain of custody and report results, and 
for Medical Review Officers (MROs) to 
document and report a verified result. 
SAMHSA allows the use of the CCF as 
a paper or electronic form. 
The current OMB-approved CCF has 
an August 31, 2026 expiration date. 
SAMHSA has resubmitted the CCF with 
revisions to the form for OMB approval. 
During 60-day public comment, 7 
commenters submitted comments on the 
proposed changes to the CCF. 
Commenters were comprised of 
individuals, organizations, and private 
sector companies. All comments were 
reviewed and taken into consideration 
in preparation of the revised CCF. The 
issues and concerns raised in the public 
comments are set out at 
www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain. 
The revisions are listed below: 
Copies 1–5 
Revised Step 1 
1. Removed drug analytes and 
checkboxes from Item F and changed 
‘‘Drug Tests to be Performed’’ to ‘‘Other 
tests to be performed (specify):’’. 
Copy 1 
Revised Step 4 
1. Moved the ‘‘Split Specimen Device 
Expiration Date’’ field to the right. 
Copies 2–5 
Revised Step 5 
1. Lengthened the email address line 
and moved it to the right. 
2. Replaced the 2 date fields for 
‘‘Daytime Phone No.’’ and ‘‘Evening 
Phone No.’’ with a single field ‘‘Phone 
No.’’ and moved it to the left. 
3. Moved the ‘‘Date of Birth’’ field to 
the left, reworded as ‘‘Birthdate’’ and 
moved the text under the line. 
Laboratories and IITFs seeking HHS 
certification under the NLCP must 
complete and submit the NLCP 
application form. The NLCP application 
form has been updated in accordance 
with the current UrMG and OFMG. The 
revisions enable provision of 
information for analytes in the 
Authorized Testing Panels now 
published separately from the 
Mandatory Guidelines, and enable 
applicant test facilities to submit 
information on new technologies/ 
instruments. 
Prior to an inspection, an HHS- 
certified laboratory or IITF is required to 
submit specific information regarding 
its procedures. Collecting this 
information prior to an inspection 
allows the inspectors to thoroughly 
review and understand the testing 
procedures before arriving for the onsite 
inspection. The NLCP information 
checklist has been updated in 
accordance with the current UrMG and 
OFMG. The revisions enable provision 
of information for analytes in the 
Authorized Testing Panels now 
published separately from the 
Mandatory Guidelines, and enable 
certified test facilities to submit 
information on new technologies/ 
instruments. 
The annual total burden estimates for 
the CCF, the NLCP application, the 
NLCP information checklist, and the 
NLCP recordkeeping requirements are

Receipt of Incidental Take Permit 
Application and Proposed Habitat 
Conservation Plan for the Sand Skink 
and Blue-Tailed Mole Skink; Osceola 
County, FL; Categorical Exclusion 
AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. 
ACTION: Notice of availability; request for comments. 
SUMMARY: We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce receipt of 
an application from Osceola County 
(Westside Technology Park) (applicant) 
for an incidental take permit (ITP) under 
the Endangered Species Act. The 
applicant requests the ITP to take the 
federally listed sand skink and blue- 
tailed mole skink incidental to the 
construction of a County park in 
Osceola County, Florida. We request 
public comment on the application, 
which includes the applicant’s 
proposed habitat conservation plan 
(HCP), and on the Service’s preliminary 
determination that the proposed 
permitting action may be eligible for a 
categorical exclusion pursuant to the 
National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA), the Department of the Interior’s 
(DOI) NEPA regulations, and the DOI 
Departmental Manual (DM). To make 
this preliminary determination, we 
prepared a draft screening form and 
NEPA statement for HCPs, which is 
available for public review. We invite 
comment from the public and local, 
State, Tribal, and Federal agencies. 
DATES: We must receive your written comments on or before January 22, 
2026.

Hermann@fws.gov. Individuals in the United States who are deaf, deafblind, 
hard of hearing, or have a speech 
disability may dial 711 (TTY, TDD, or 
TeleBraille) to access 
telecommunications relay services. 
Individuals outside the United States 
should use the relay services offered 
within their country to make 
international calls to the point-of- 
contact in the United States. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: We, the Service, announce receipt of an 
application from Osceola County 
(Westside Technology Park) (applicant) 
for an ITP, also known as a section 
10(a)(1)(B) permit, under the 
Endangered Species Act of 1973, as 
amended (ESA; 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). 
The applicant requests the ITP to take 
federally listed sand skinks (Neopseps 
(=Plestiodon) reynoldsi) and blue-tailed 
mole skinks (Eumeces egregius lividus) 
(skinks) incidental to the construction 
and operation of a County park in 
Osceola County, Florida. 
We request public comment on the 
application, which includes the 
applicant’s HCP, and on the Service’s 
preliminary determination that this 
proposed ITP may qualify for a 
categorical exclusion pursuant to NEPA 
(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), DOI’s NEPA 
regulations (43 CFR 46), and DOI’s DM 
(516 DM 8.5(C)(2)). To make this 
preliminary determination, we prepared 
a draft screening form and NEPA 
statement for HCPs, which is available 
for public review. 
Proposed Project 
The applicant requests a 5-year ITP to 
take skinks via the conversion of 
approximately 0.47 acres (ac) of 
occupied nesting, foraging, and 
sheltering skink habitat incidental to the 
construction and operation of Westside 
Technology Park on 40 acs, Parcel #07– 
25–27–000000–200000 in Section 07, 
Township 25 South, Range 27 East, 
Osceola County, Florida. 
The applicant proposes to mitigate for 
take of the skinks by purchasing credits 
equivalent to 0.94 ac of skink-occupied 
habitat within a Service-approved 
conservation bank. The Service would 
require the applicant to purchase the 
credits no later than 30 days after the 
issuance of the permit and prior to any 
clearing activities. The applicant will 
provide educational opportunities 
through signage and QR codes that will 
focus on native plants and wildlife 
including the sand and blue-tailed mole 
skinks and their habitat. 
Our Preliminary Determination 
The Service has made a preliminary 
determination that reasonably 
foreseeable effects of the applicant’s 
proposed project, including the 
construction of the county park and 
associated clearing, would have a minor 
effect on the skinks and the human 
environment and that no extraordinary 
circumstances in 43 CFR 46.215 apply. 
Reasonably foreseeable effects 
encompass effects of implementation of 
the action including effects of the action 
in addition to other past, present, and 
reasonably foreseeable future effects. 
Therefore, we have preliminarily 
determined that the proposed ESA 
section 10(a)(1)(B) permit would be a 
low-effect ITP that may qualify for 
application of a categorical exclusion 
(516 DM 8.5(C)(2)), pursuant to NEPA 
and DOI’s NEPA regulations and DM. A 
low-effect ITP is one that would result 
in (1) negligible or minor individual or 
cumulative effects on species covered in 
the HCP; (2) no significant effect on the 
human environment; and (3) reasonably 
foreseeable effects that would not result 
in significant effects to the human 
environment. 
Next Steps 
The Service will evaluate the 
application and the comments to 
determine whether to issue the 
requested ITP. We will also conduct an 
intra-Service consultation pursuant to 
section 7 of the ESA to evaluate the 
effects of the proposed take. After 
considering the preceding and other 
matters, we will determine whether the 
permit issuance criteria of section 
10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA have been met. If 
met, the Service will issue ITP number 
PER 21116185 to Osceola County.

Abstract: The general permit requirements at 50 CFR part 13 provide 
the uniform rules, conditions, and 
procedures for the application for, and 
the issuance, denial, suspension, 
revocation, and general administration 
of, all permits for all of the laws, 
treaties, and regulations administered 
by the Service that authorize activities 
requiring permits. The requirements in 
50 CFR part 13 are in addition to any 
other permit regulations that may apply 
to a specific circumstance and are 
outlined in other sections of our 
regulations. 
The Wild Bird Conservation Act 
(WBCA; 16 U.S.C. 4901–4916) and the 
Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and 
Flora (CITES; 27 U.S.T. 1087, March 3, 
1973) mandate a system of permits and 
certificates to help ensure that 
international trade is legal and does not 
threaten the survival of wildlife or plant 
species in the wild. Permits under the 
U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA; 16 
U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) and the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act (MMPA; 16 
U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) ensure that 
activities are consistent with the intent 
and purposes of the ESA and MMPA. 
Permitted activities under the Bald and 
Golden Eagle Act (BGEPA; 16 U.S.C. 
668–668d) must be compatible with the 
preservation of eagles. Permitted 
activities regarding injurious wildlife 
under the Lacey Act (18 U.S.C. 42; 16 
U.S.C. 3371–3378) regulate the 
importation into the United States and 
any shipment between the continental 
United States, the District of Columbia, 
Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, or any possession of the 
United States, of animal species 
determined to be injurious by the 
Secretary of the Interior. Such 
importation and shipments are 
prohibited, except by permit. Although 
the Service’s Division of Management 
Authority does not administer the 
Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA; 16 
U.S.C. 704), we receive authorization 
from the Migratory Bird Program to 
issue import/export permits under the 
MBTA. 
Prior to the import or export of 
species listed under the MBTA, MMPA,

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60120 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Notices BGEPA, Lacey Act, WBCA, ESA, and/or 
CITES, the Management Authority and 
Scientific Authority must make 
appropriate determinations and issue 
the appropriate documents. Section 8A 
of the ESA designates the Secretary of 
the Interior as the U.S. Management 
Authority and U.S. Scientific Authority 
for CITES. The Secretary in turn 
delegated these authorities to the 
Service. 
Before a country can issue an export 
permit for CITES appendix I or II 
specimens, the CITES Scientific 
Authority of the exporting country must 
determine that the export will not be 
detrimental to the survival of the 
species, and the Management Authority 
must be satisfied that the specimens 
were acquired legally. For the export of 
appendix III specimens, the 
Management Authority must be satisfied 
that the specimens were acquired 
legally (CITES does not require findings 
from the Scientific Authority). Prior to 
the importation of appendix I 
specimens, both the Scientific Authority 
and the Management Authority of the 
importing country must make required 
findings. The Scientific Authority must 
also monitor trade of all species to 
ensure that the level of trade is 
sustainable. 
Article VIII(3) of the CITES treaty 
states that participating parties should 
make efforts to ensure that CITES 
specimens are traded with a minimum 
of delay. Section XIII of Resolution 
Conf. 12.3 (Rev. CoP19) recommends 
use of simplified procedures for issuing 
CITES documents to expedite trade that 
will have no impact, or a negligible 
impact, on conservation of the species 
involved. 
Applications and Reports 
All Service permit applications and 
reports are in the 3–200 series of forms, 
each tailored to a specific activity based 
on the requirements for specific types of 
permits. In accordance with Federal 
regulations at 50 CFR 13.12, we collect 
standard identifier information for all 
permit applications, such as: 
€Applicant’s full name, whether an individual or business, and address 
(street address, city, county, State, 
and zip code; and mailing address, if 
different from street address); main 
and alternate telephone numbers; and 
an email address (required if filing 
electronically, optional for a mail-in 
application); and 
—If the applicant resides or is located 
outside the United States, an 
address in the United States, and, if 
the applicant is conducting 
commercial activities, the name and 
address of the applicant’s agent 
inside the United States; and 
—If the applicant is a business, 
corporation, public agency, or 
institution, the tax identification 
number; description of the business 
type, corporation, agency, or 
institution; and the name and title 
of the person responsible for the 
permit (such as president, principal 
officer, or director); 
€Location where the requested permitted activity is to occur or be 
conducted; 
€Reference to the part(s) and section(s) of subchapter B as listed in paragraph 
(b) of 50 CFR part 13 under which the 
application is made for a permit or 
permits, together with any additional 
justification, including supporting 
documentation as required by the 
referenced part(s) and section(s); 
€If the requested permitted activity involves the import or re-export of 
wildlife or plants from or to any 
foreign country, and the country of 
origin, or the country of export or re- 
export restricts the taking, possession, 
transportation, exportation, or sale of 
wildlife or plants, documentation as 
indicated in § 14.52(c) of subchapter 
B; 
€Certification containing the following language: 
—I hereby certify that I have read and 
am familiar with the regulations 
contained in title 50, part 13, of the 
Code of Federal Regulations and the 
other applicable parts in subchapter 
B of chapter I of title 50, Code of 
Federal Regulations, and I further 
certify that the information 
submitted in this application for a 
permit is complete and accurate to 
the best of my knowledge and 
belief. I understand that any false 
statement herein may subject me to 
suspension or revocation of this 
permit and to the criminal penalties 
of 18 U.S.C. 1001. 
€Desired effective date of permit (except where issuance date is fixed 
by the part under which the permit is 
issued); 
€Signature date; €Signature of the applicant; €Such other information as the Director determines relevant to the processing 
of the application; and 
€Additional information required on applications for other types of permits 
may be found by referring to table 1 
in paragraph (b) in 50 CFR 13.12. 
Standardization of general 
information common to the forms makes 
the filing of applications easier for the 
public, as well as expediting our review 
of applications. The information that we 
collect on applications and reports is 
the minimum necessary for us to 
determine if the applicant meets/ 
continues to meet issuance 
requirements for the particular activity.

€International Reporting Requirements—The Service imposes 
international reporting requirements 
specified in 50 CFR parts 13, 17, 18, 
and 23. These reporting requirements 
are associated with the findings we 
must make under the various laws, 
treaties, and regulations administered 
by the Service. This may include 
consultation on sustainable use, 
population data, management 
practices, and verification of 
information received from other 
sources. The Service does not provide 
a form for this collection; rather, we 
request specific information based on 
the most current data we hold, in 
order to enable us to update or clarify 
that data. We estimate the annual 
burden associated with the 
international reporting requirements 
to be 24 responses and 192 burden 
hours. There are no nonhour burden 
costs associated with the international 
reporting requirements. 
€Recordkeeping Requirements, 50 CFR 13.46—Permittees must keep records 
of all activities conducted under 
certain permits, including those of 
subpermittees carried out under the 
authority of the permit, as well as 
documentation of any take that occurs 
from the permitted activity and the 
data gathered through surveys and 
monitoring. We use these data to 
assess the conservation benefits or 
detriments to plant and wildlife 
populations. Additionally, under 50 
CFR 13.47, the Service may enter a 
permittee’s premises at any 
reasonable hour to inspect any 
wildlife or plant held or to inspect, 
audit, or copy any permits, books, or 
records required to be kept by these 
regulations for compliance under the 
permit conditions 
€Amendments to Permit Applications—Amendments to a 
permit may be requested by the 
permittee, or the Service may amend 
a permit for just cause upon a written 
finding of necessity. Amendments 
comprise changes to the permit 
authorization or conditions. The 
permittee must apply for amendments 
to the permit by submitting a 
description of the modified activity 
and the changed impacts. These are 
considered substantive amendments 
and incur a fee. For CITES permits, if 
there is a change in the legal 
individual or business name, this is 
considered a substantive amendment 
and incurs a fee. For federal permits, 
a permittee is not required to obtain 
a new permit if there is a change in 
the legal individual or business name, 
or in the mailing address of the 
permittee. A permittee is required to 
notify the issuing office within 10 
calendar days of such change. This 
provision does not authorize any 
change in location of the conduct of 
the permitted activity when approval 
of the location is a qualifying 
condition of the permit.

Abstract: Reclamation is responsible for recreation development at all of its 
reservoirs. Presently, more than 240 
designated recreation areas exist on our 
lands within the 17 Western States, 
hosting approximately 40 million 
visitors annually. As a result, we must 
be able to respond to emerging trends; 
changes in the demographic profile of 
users; changing values, needs, wants, 
and desires; and conflicts between user 
groups. 
Statistically valid and up-to-date data 
derived from the user is essential to 
developing and providing recreation 
programs relevant to today’s visitor. 
Reclamation is requesting re-approval 
for the collection of data from 
recreational users on Reclamation lands 
and waterbodies. 
To meet our needs for the collection 
of visitor data, we will request OMB 
authorize a two-part request: survey 
questions from which our regional 
offices may choose and a survey form 
template. This will allow for a custom 
designed survey instrument to fit a 
specific activity or recreation site. The 
custom designed survey would be 
created by extracting questions from the 
approved list of survey questions that 
are applicable to the recreation area and 
issue being evaluated. Only questions 
included in the pre-approved list of 
survey questions will be used. 
Revisions to this collection will be 
made to adjust respondent demographic 
questions to conform with Executive 
Order 14168, ‘‘Defending Women From 
Gender Ideology Extremism and 
Restoring Biological Truth to the 
Federal Government’’ (January 20, 2025) 
and OMB’s ‘‘2024 Statistical Policy 
Directive No. 15: Federal Race and 
Ethnicity Data Standards.’’ 
Title of Collection: Recreation Survey 
Questions. 
OMB Control Number: 1006–0028. 
Form Number: 7–2675, Recreation 
Survey Questions. 
Type of Review: Revision of a 
currently approved collection. 
Respondents/Affected Public: 
Respondents to the surveys will be 
members of the public engaged in 
recreational activities on Reclamation 
lands and waterbodies. Visitors will 
primarily consist of local residents, 
people from large metropolitan areas in 
the vicinity of the lake/reservoir, and 
people from out of state. 
Total Estimated Number of Annual 
Respondents: 696. Total Estimated Number of Annual 
Responses: 696. Estimated Completion Time per 
Response: 15 minutes per survey (an average of 20 questions will be used on 
each survey; each question will take 
approximately 45 seconds to complete 
on average). 
Total Estimated Number of Annual 
Burden Hours: 140. 
Respondent’s Obligation: Voluntary. 
Frequency of Collection: Twice 
annually. 
Total Estimated Annual Nonhour 
Burden cost: None. 
Reclamation estimates that there will 
be a total of 140 out of 696 contacts that 
choose not to respond to the survey. 
These non-respondents account for 1 
burden hour per year. 
An agency may not conduct or 
sponsor and a person is not required to 
respond to a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number.

Hasbro, Inc. of Pawtucket, Rhode Island 
(‘‘Hasbro’’), and Spin Master, Inc. of Los 
Angeles, California (‘‘Spin Master’’) 
(together, ‘‘Complainants’’). 87 FR 
52595–96 (Aug. 26, 2022). The 
complaint, as supplemented, alleges a 
violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act 
of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1337 
(‘‘section 337’’), based upon the 
importation into the United States, the

(together, ‘‘PTT’’) (collectively, 
‘‘Respondents’’). Id. The Office of Unfair Import Investigations (‘‘OUII’’) is a party 
to the investigation. Id. at 52595–96. The Commission previously 
terminated the investigation with 
respect to claims 1–7, 9–15, 17, 18, and 
21 of the ’282 patent and claims 1–4, 6, 
10–12, 13 and 15 of the ’683 patent 
based on Complainants’ partial 
withdrawal of the complaint. Order No. 
10 (Oct. 25, 2022), unreviewed by 
Comm’n Notice (Nov. 16, 2022); Order 
No. 21 (Jan. 18, 2023), unreviewed by 
Comm’n Notice (Feb. 14, 2023); Order 
No. 44 (May 17, 2023), unreviewed by 
Comm’n Notice (May 30, 2023). 
Accordingly, at the time of the 
evidentiary hearing, claims 8, 19, and 20 
of the ’282 patent and claims 5 and 14 
of the ’683 patent remained at issue. 
On November 10, 2022, Complainants 
and Respondents stipulated that the 
’282 and ’683 patents share a common 
specification and describe projectile 
launchers, soft projectiles made with 
‘‘super absorbent polymers,’’ and 
systems comprised of projectile 
launchers and soft projectiles. 
Technology Stipulation (Nov. 10, 2022). 
On November 21, 2022, Respondents 
stipulated that the importation 
requirement is satisfied. Gel Blaser 
Respondents’ Stipulation and Waiver 
Regarding Importation (Nov. 21, 2022) 
(EDIS Doc. ID 784955); Prime Time Toys 
Respondents’ Stipulation and Waiver

Respondents’ Stipulation and Waiver 
Regarding the Issue of Importation (Nov. 
21, 2022) (EDIS Doc. ID 784914). On 
May 16, 2023, Complainants and 
Respondents stipulated that the 
technical prong of the domestic industry 
requirement is satisfied under the 
presiding administrative law judge’s 
(‘‘ALJ’’) construction of ‘‘super 
absorbent polymer.’’ Stipulation 
Regarding Domestic Industry Products 
(May 16, 2023) (EDIS Doc. ID 796608). 
On May 18, 2023, the parties stipulated 
regarding the disclosure of prior art. 
Stipulation Regarding Prior Art (May 18, 
2023) (EDIS Doc. ID 796787). 
On March 27, 2023, the ALJ issued a 
claim construction order. Order No. 28 
(Mar. 27, 2023). The ALJ held an 
evidentiary hearing on May 19, and 22– 
23, 2023. 
On April 27, 2023, the ALJ granted a 
motion for a summary determination 
that Respondents infringed claims 6, 8, 
19, and 20 of the ’282 patent and claims 
1, 5, and 11 of the ’683 patent. Order 
No. 37 (Apr. 27, 2023). Shortly 
thereafter, the Commission terminated 
the Gel Blaster Respondents and Splat- 
R-Ball Respondents based on settlement. 
Order No. 42 (May 17, 2023), 
unreviewed by Comm’n Notice (May 30, 
2023); Order No. 45 (May 19, 2023), 
unreviewed by Comm’n Notice (May 30, 
2023). Also, as noted above, the 
Commission subsequently terminated 
the investigation with respect to claim 
6 of the ’282 patent and claims 1, and 
11 of the ’683 patent. Accordingly, the 
Commission affirmed the grant of 
summary determination of infringement 
against PTT regarding claims 8, 19, and 
20 of the ’282 patent and claims 5 of the 
’683 patent but determined to review 
and vacate as moot the findings with 
respect to the Gel Blaster Respondents, 
Splat-R-Ball Respondents, and the 
withdrawn claims. Comm’n Notice (May 
30, 2023). 
On October 25, 2023, the ALJ issued 
a final initial determination (‘‘Final ID’’) 
finding a violation of section 337 with 
respect to claims 8, 19, and 20 of the 
’282 patent and claims 5 and 14 of the 
’683 patent. Final ID at ii–iii. 
Specifically, the Final ID notes that the 
Commission already found that ‘‘the 
Accused Blasters (i.e., blaster kits with blasters and ammunition)’’ directly 
infringe claims 8, 19, and 20 of the ’282 
patent and claim 5 of the ’683 patent, 
and that PTT stipulated that the accused 
products directly infringe claim 14. Id. 
at 21–22, 38–39. The Final ID finds that 
PTT also induces and contributes to 
infringement with respect to those 
claims. Id. at 25–30, 39–41. The Final ID further finds that Complainants have 
satisfied the technical prong of the 
domestic industry requirement with 
respect to claims 8, 19, and 20 of the 
’282 patent and claims 5 and 14 of the 
’683 patent. Id. at 31–36, 41–44. Additionally, the Final ID finds that the 
asserted claims are not invalid as 
obvious under 35 U.S.C. 103 due to 
PTT’s failure to provide a motivation to 
combine the references at issue and 
Complainants’ showing on secondary 
considerations. Id. at 44–91. Finally, the Final ID finds that Complainants failed 
to show that a domestic industry exists, 
but that Complainants did show that a 
domestic industry is in the process of 
being established. Id. at 91–117. The Commission received no 
comments from the public or interested 
government agencies regarding any 
public interest issues raised by the ALJ’s 
recommended determination on 
remedy. 88 FR 74510–11 (Oct. 31, 2023). 
The Commission also received no 
comments concerning the public 
interest from the parties pursuant to 
Commission Rule 210.50(a)(4). 19 CFR 
210.50(a)(4). 
On November 6, 2023, PTT filed a 
petition for review challenging the Final 
ID’s findings that: (1) PTT failed to 
provide motivations to combine prior 
art to support a finding of obviousness; 
(2) secondary considerations support a 
finding of non-obviousness; and (3) 
Complainants showed an industry in 
the process of being established. Also on 
November 6, 2023, Complainants filed a 
contingent petition for review of the 
Final ID’s finding that Complainants 
failed to show that a domestic industry 
exists. On November 14. 2023, the 
Complainants and PTT filed responses 
opposing each other’s petitions, and 
OUII filed a response opposing both 
petitions. 
On January 30, 2024, the Commission 
determined to review the Final ID with 
respect to the Final ID’s findings on 
obviousness and the economic prong of 
the domestic industry requirement. 
Comm’n Notice (Jan. 30, 2024). The 
Commission sought briefing from the 
parties on the issue of whether any 
argument or evidence was presented to 
the ALJ that a significant and unusual 
development(s) existed after the 
complaint was filed in this matter that 
may justify consideration of post- 
complaint evidence to support 
Complainants’ domestic industry claim. 
The Commission also sought briefing 
from the parties, interested government 
agencies, and other interested parties to 
file written submissions on the issues of 
remedy, the public interest, and 
bonding. Id. The Commission received initial submissions from Complainants, 
PTT, OUII, and Brian Hoffer, and reply 
submissions from Complainants, PTT, 
and OUII. 
Having examined the record of this 
investigation, including the Final ID, the 
petitions, responses, and other 
submissions from the parties, the 
Commission has determined that 
Complainants have failed to show a 
violation of section 337. Specifically, 
the Commission has determined to: (1)

because PTT failed to show by clear and 
convincing evidence a motivation to 
combine the asserted prior art; (2) affirm 
the Final ID’s finding that 
Complainants’ showing of secondary 
considerations of commercial success 
and industry praise support a finding of 
non-obviousness; (3) affirm, under 
modified reasoning, the Final ID’s 
finding that Complainants’ failed to 
show that a domestic industry exists; 
and (4) reverse the Final ID’s finding 
that a domestic industry is in the 
process of being established. 
Accordingly, the Commission finds that 
Complainants failed to show a violation 
of section 337 based on Complainants’ 
failure to establish the economic prong 
of the domestic industry requirement. 
The Commission’s reasoning in 
support of its determinations is set forth 
more fully in its opinion. Chair Karpel 
dissents from the Commission’s finding 
of no violation of section 337 for the 
reasons detailed in her dissenting views. 
All other findings in the ID under 
review that are consistent with the 
Commission’s determinations are 
affirmed. The investigation is hereby 
terminated. 
The Commission vote for this 
determination took place on December 
18, 2025. 
The authority for the Commission’s 
determination is contained in section 
337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended (19 U.S.C. 1337), and in part 
210 of the Commission’s Rules of 
Practice and Procedure (19 CFR part 
210). 
By order of the Commission.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Copyright Act grants to sound 
recordings copyright owners the 
exclusive right to publicly perform 
sound recordings by means of certain 
digital audio transmissions, subject to 
limitations. Specifically, the right is 
limited by certain exemptions as well 
the statutory license in section 114, 
which allows nonexempt noninteractive 
digital subscription services, eligible 
nonsubscription services, and 
preexisting satellite digital audio radio 
services to perform publicly sound 
recordings by means of digital audio 
transmissions. 17 U.S.C. 114(f). In 
addition, a statutory license in section 
112 allows certain services to make 
necessary ephemeral reproductions to 
facilitate digital transmission of the 
sound recording. 17 U.S.C. 112(e). 
Licensees may operate under these 
licenses provided they pay the royalty 
fees and comply with the terms set by 
the Copyright Royalty Judges. The rates 
and terms for the section 112 and 114 
licenses are codified in 37 CFR parts 
380 and 382–84. 
As one of the terms for these licenses, 
the Judges designated SoundExchange, 
Inc., (SoundExchange) as the Collective, 
i.e., the organization charged with collecting the royalty payments and 
statements of account submitted by 
licensees, including those that operate 
commercial and noncommercial 
webcaster services, preexisting satellite 
digital audio radio services, new 
subscription services, and those that 
make ephemeral copies for transmission 
to business establishments. The 
Collective is also charged with 
distributing the royalties to the 
copyright owners and performers 
entitled to receive them under the 
section 112 and 114 licenses. See 37 CFR 380.4(d)(1), 382.5(d)(1), 383.4(a), 
384.4(b)(1). 
As the Collective, SoundExchange 
may, only once a year, conduct an audit 
of a licensee for any or all of the prior 
three calendar years to verify royalty 
payments. SoundExchange must first 
file with the Judges a notice of intent to 
audit a licensee and deliver the notice 
to the licensee. See 37 CFR 380.6(b), 382.7(b), 383.4(a) and 384.6(b). 
On December 12, 2025, 
SoundExchange filed with the Judges 
notices of intent to audit the statements 
of account submitted by licensees Cox 
Media Group, Hope Media Group, 
Pandora Media LLC, Saga 
Communications Inc., 
SomaFM.com,LLC, Townsquare Media, 
Z Ministries, Inc., Mood Media, Music 
Choice, and SiriusXM for the years 
2022, 2023, and 2024. The Judges must 
publish notice in the Federal Register 
within 30 days of receipt of a notice 
announcing the Collective’s intent to 
conduct an audit. See 37 CFR 380.6(c) 382.7(c), 383.4(a) and 384.6(c). This 
notice fulfills the Judges’ publication 
obligation.

submitted a request for renewal of an 
existing collection of information to 
OMB for review entitled, NRC Form 
396, ‘‘Certification of Medical 
Examination by Facility Licensee.’’ The 
NRC hereby informs potential 
respondents that an agency may not 
conduct or sponsor, and that a person is 
not required to respond to, a collection 
of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. 
The NRC published a Federal 
Register notice with a 60-day comment period on this information collection on 
September 3, 2025, 90 FR 42626. 
1. The title of the information collection: NRC Form 396, Certification of Medical Examination by Facility 
Licensee. 
2. OMB approval number: 3150–0024. 3. Type of submission: Extension. 4. The form number, if applicable: NRC Form 396. 
5. How often the collection is required or requested: Upon application for an 
initial or upgrade license; every 6 years 
for the renewal of an operator or senior 
operator license, and notices of 
disability that occur during licensed 
tenure. 
6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Facility licensees who are tasked with certifying the medical 
fitness or operator licensee.

information collection requirement or 
request: 2,161 hours (1,729 reporting hours + 432 recordkeeping hours). 
10. Abstract: NRC Form 396 is used to transmit information to the NRC 
regarding the medical condition of 
applicants for initial operator licenses or 
renewal of operator licenses and for the 
maintenance of medical records for all 
licensed operators. The information is 
used to determine whether the physical 
condition and general health of 
applicants for operator licensees is such 
that the applicant would not be 
expected to cause operational errors and 
endanger public health and safety.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
The Commission hereby gives notice 
that, pursuant to Section 189a of the 
Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 1954, as 
amended, it will commence an 
uncontested hearing, in which the 
Commission will receive written 
evidence in the form of testimony and 
exhibits regarding the application 
submitted by TerraPower, on behalf of 
USO, for a construction permit to 
construct a nuclear-powered generating 
plant termed Kemmerer Power Station 
Unit 1 in Lincoln County, Wyoming. 
TerraPower’s application was 
submitted by letter on March 28, 2024 
(Agencywide Documents Access and 
Management System (ADAMS) 
Accession No. ML24088A060). 
The NRC staff’s Final Environmental 
Impact Statement and Safety Evaluation 
Report may be viewed at ADAMS 
Accession Nos. ML25287A017 and 
ML25329A252, respectively. This 
mandatory hearing will concern safety 
and environmental matters relating to 
the requested construction permit 
application, as more fully described 
below. 
II. Evidentiary Uncontested Hearing 
The Commission will conduct this 
hearing using written materials only. 
The schedule and process for submitting 
written materials to the Commission is 
detailed in Sections V and VI below. 
The parties to this proceeding are 
TerraPower and the NRC staff. 
III. Presiding Officer 
The Commission is the presiding 
officer for this proceeding. 
IV. Matters To Be Considered 
The matter at issue in this proceeding 
is whether the review of the TerraPower 
Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1 
construction permit application by the 
Commission’s staff has been adequate to 
support the findings found in 10 CFR 
50.35, 50.40, 50.50, and 10 CFR 51.105. 
Those findings are as follows: 
Issues Pursuant to the Atomic Energy 
Act of 1954, as Amended 
With respect to the construction 
permit: (1) whether the applicant has 
described the proposed design of the 
facility, including, but not limited to, 
the principal architectural and 
engineering criteria for the design, and 
has identified the major features or 
components incorporated therein for the 
protection of the health and safety of the

public; (2) whether such further 
technical or design information as may 
be required to complete the safety 
analysis, and which can reasonably be 
left for later consideration, will be 
supplied in the final safety analysis 
report; (3) whether safety features or 
components, if any, which require 
research and development have been 
described by the applicant and the 
applicant has identified, and there will 
be conducted, a research and 
development program reasonably 
designed to resolve any safety questions 
associated with such features or 
components; (4) whether on the basis of 
the foregoing, there is reasonable 
assurance that (i) such safety questions 
will be satisfactorily resolved at or 
before the latest date stated in the 
application for completion of 
construction of the proposed facility, 
and (ii) taking into consideration the 
site criteria contained in 10 CFR part 
100, the proposed facility can be 
constructed and operated at the 
proposed location without undue risk to 
the health and safety of the public; (5) 
whether there is reasonable assurance (i) 
that the construction of the facility will 
not endanger the health and safety of 
the public, and (ii) that construction 
activities can be conducted in 
compliance with the Commission’s 
regulations; (6) whether the applicant is 
technically and financially qualified to 
engage in the proposed activities in 
accordance with the Commission’s 
regulations in chapter I of title 10 of the 
CFR; (7) whether the issuance of a 
permit for the construction of the 
facility to the applicant will not, in the 
opinion of the Commission, be inimical 
to the common defense and security or 
to the health and safety of the public; 
and (8) whether the application meets 
the standards and requirements of the 
AEA and the Commission’s regulations, 
and that notifications, if any, to other 
agencies or bodies have been duly 
made. 
Issues Pursuant to the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 
1969 
With respect to the construction 
permit: (1) determine whether the 
requirements of Sections 102(2)(A), (C), 
and (E) of NEPA and the applicable 
regulations in 10 CFR part 51 have been 
met; (2) independently consider the 
final balance among conflicting factors 
contained in the record of the 
proceeding with a view to determining 
the appropriate action to be taken; (3) 
determine, after weighing the 
environmental, economic, technical, 
and other benefits against 
environmental and other costs, and 
considering reasonable alternatives, 
whether the construction permit should 
be issued, denied, or appropriately 
conditioned to protect environmental 
values; and (4) determine whether the 
NEPA review conducted by the NRC 
staff has been adequate. 
V. Schedule for Submittal of Written 
Evidence

II. Background 
Under the provisions of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. Chapter 35), the NRC recently 
submitted a request for renewal of an 
existing collection of information to 
OMB for review entitled, NRC Form 
244, ‘‘Registration Certificate—Use of 
Depleted Uranium.’’ The NRC hereby 
informs potential respondents that an 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and 
that a person is not required to respond 
to, a collection of information unless it 
displays a currently valid OMB control 
number. 
The NRC published a Federal 
Register notice with a 60-day comment period on this information collection on 
August 15, 2025, 90 FR 39430. 
1. The title of the information collection: NRC Form 244, Registration Certificate—Use of Depleted Uranium. 
2. OMB approval number: 3150–0031. 3. Type of submission: Extension. 4. The form number, if applicable: NRC Form 244. 
5. How often the collection is required or requested: On occasion. 
6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Persons who receive, acquire, possess, or use depleted uranium. 
7. The estimated number of annual responses: 21. 8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 8.5. 9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or 
request: 12.2 (8.5 reporting + 1.7 recordkeeping + 2.0 third-party 
disclosure). 
10. Abstract: The NRC regulations in part 40 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations, establishes requirements for the receipt, possession, use and 
transfer of radioactive source and 
byproduct materials. Section 40.25 
established a general license authorizing 
the use of depleted uranium contained 
in industrial products or devices for the 
purpose of providing a concentrated 
mass in a small volume of the product 
or device. The NRC Form 244 is used to 
report the receipt and transfer of 
depleted uranium, as required by 10 
CFR40.25. The registration information 
required by the NRC Form 244 enables 
the NRC to make a determination on 
whether the possession, use, or transfer 
of depleted uranium source and 
byproduct material is in conformance 
with the NRC’s regulations for the 
protection of public health and safety. 
General licensees can also use NRC 
Form 244 to update any of the 
information contained in the form, once 
the form is authorized by the NRC.

II. Notice of Consideration of Issuance 
of Amendments to Facility Operating 
Licenses and Combined Licenses and 
Proposed No Significant Hazards 
Consideration Determination 
For the facility-specific amendment 
requests shown in this notice, the 
Commission finds that the licensees’ 
analyses provided, consistent with 
section 50.91 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR) ‘‘Notice 
for public comment; State 
consultation,’’ are sufficient to support 
the proposed determinations that these 
amendment requests involve NSHC. 
Under the Commission’s regulations in 
10 CFR 50.92, operation of the facilities 
in accordance with the proposed 
amendments would not (1) involve a 
significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously 
evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of 
a new or different kind of accident from 
any accident previously evaluated; or 
(3) involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety. 
The Commission is seeking public 
comments on these proposed 
determinations. Any comments received 
within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be 
considered in making any final 
determinations. 
Normally, the Commission will not 
issue the amendments until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of 
publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue any of these 
license amendments before expiration of 
the 60-day period provided that its final 
determination is that the amendment 
involves NSHC. In addition, the 
Commission may issue any of these 
amendments prior to the expiration of 
the 30-day comment period if 
circumstances change during the 30-day 
comment period such that failure to act 
in a timely way would result, for 
example in derating or shutdown of the 
facility. If the Commission takes action 
on any of these amendments prior to the 
expiration of either the comment period 
or the notice period, it will publish in 
the Federal Register a notice of issuance. If the Commission makes a 
final NSHC determination for any of 
these amendments, any hearing will 
take place after issuance. The 
Commission expects that the need to 
take action on any amendment before 60 
days have elapsed will occur very 
infrequently. 
A. Opportunity To Request a Hearing 
and Petition for Leave To Intervene 
Within 60 days after the date of 
publication of this notice, any person

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60136 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Notices affected by any of these actions may file 
a request for a hearing and petition for 
leave to intervene (petition) with respect 
to that action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the Commission’s 
‘‘Agency Rules of Practice and 
Procedure’’ in 10 CFR part 2. Interested 
persons should consult a current copy 
of 10 CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed, the 
Commission or a presiding officer will 
rule on the petition and, if appropriate, 
a notice of a hearing will be issued. 
Petitions must be filed no later than 
60 days from the date of publication of 
this notice in accordance with the filing 
instructions in the ‘‘Electronic 
Submissions (E-Filing)’’ section of this 
document. Petitions and motions for 
leave to file new or amended 
contentions that are filed after the 
deadline will not be entertained absent 
a determination by the presiding officer 
that the filing demonstrates good cause 
by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 
2.309(c)(1)(i) through (iii). 
If a hearing is requested, and the 
Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final 
determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which 
will serve to establish when the hearing 
is held. If the final determination is that 
the amendment request involves no 
significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission may issue the amendment 
and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a 
hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the 
final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a 
significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place 
before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an 
imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue 
an appropriate order or rule under 10 
CFR part 2. 
A State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or 
designated agency thereof, may submit 
a petition to the Commission to 
participate as a party under 10 CFR 
2.309(h) no later than 60 days from the 
date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local 
governmental body, Federally 
recognized Indian Tribe, or agency 
thereof may participate as a non-party 
under 10 CFR 2.315(c). 
For information about filing a petition 
and about participation by a person not 
a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS 
Accession No. ML20340A053 (https://
adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/ 
main.jsp?Accession
Number=ML20340A053) and on the 
NRC’s public website at https://
www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/ 
adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate. B. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing) 
All documents filed in NRC 
adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, 
local governmental body, Federally 
recognized Indian Tribe, or designated 
agency thereof that requests to 
participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must 
be filed in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all 
adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies 
on electronic storage media, unless an 
exemption permitting an alternative 
filing method, as further discussed, is 
granted. Detailed guidance on electronic 
submissions is located in the ‘‘Guidance 
for Electronic Submissions to the NRC’’ 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056), 
and on the NRC’s public website 
(https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e- 
submittals.html). 
To comply with the procedural 
requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the 
participant should contact the Office of 
the Secretary by email at 
Hearing.Docket@nrc.gov, or by telephone at 301–415–1677, to: (1) 
request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate which allows the participant 
(or its counsel or representative) to 
digitally sign submissions and access 
the E-Filing system for any proceeding 
in which it is participating; and (2) 
advise the Secretary that the participant 
will be submitting a petition or other 
adjudicatory document (even in 
instances in which the participant, or its 
counsel or representative, already holds 
an NRC-issued digital ID certificate). 
Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic 
docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an 
electronic docket. 
Information about applying for a 
digital ID certificate is available on the 
NRC’s public website at https://
www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/
getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is obtained and a docket is 
created, the participant must submit 
adjudicatory documents in the Portable 
Document Format. Guidance on 
submissions is available on the NRC’s 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/ 
site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the time 
the document is submitted through the 
NRC’s E-Filing system. To be timely, an 
electronic filing must be submitted to 
the E-Filing system no later than 11:59 
p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt 
of a transmission, the E-Filing system 
time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming 
receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that 
provides access to the document to the 
NRC’s Office of the General Counsel and 
any others who have advised the Office 
of the Secretary that they wish to 
participate in the proceeding, so that the 
filer need not serve the document on 
those participants separately. Therefore, 
applicants and other participants (or 
their counsel or representative) must 
apply for and receive a digital ID 
certificate before adjudicatory 
documents are filed in order to obtain 
access to the documents via the E-Filing 
system. 
A person filing electronically using 
the NRC’s adjudicatory E-Filing system 
may seek assistance by contacting the 
NRC’s Electronic Filing Help Desk 
through the ‘‘Contact Us’’ link located 
on the NRC’s public website at https:// 
www.nrc.gov/site-help/e- 
submittals.html, by email to MSHD.Resource@nrc.gov, or by a toll- free call at 1–866–672–7640. The NRC 
Electronic Filing Help Desk is available 
between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., ET, Monday 
through Friday, except Federal holidays. 
Participants who believe that they 
have good cause for not submitting 
documents electronically must file an 
exemption request, in accordance with 
10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper 
filing stating why there is good cause for 
not filing electronically and requesting 
authorization to continue to submit 
documents in paper format. Such filings 
must be submitted in accordance with 
10 CFR 2.302(b)–(d). Participants filing 
adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their 
documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption 
under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still meet 
the electronic formatting requirement in 
10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), unless the 
participant also seeks and is granted an 
exemption from 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1). 
Documents submitted in adjudicatory 
proceedings will appear in the NRC’s 
electronic hearing docket, which is 
publicly available at https://
adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless otherwise excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an 
NRC-issued digital ID certificate as 
previously described, click ‘‘cancel’’ 
when the link requests certificates and 
you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC’s electronic hearing docket where 
you will be able to access any publicly 
available documents in a particular 
hearing docket. Participants are 
requested not to include personal

to Facility Operating Licenses and 
Combined Licenses 
During the period since publication of 
the last monthly notice, the Commission 
has issued the following amendments. 
The Commission has determined for 
each of these amendments that the 
application complies with the standards 
and requirements of the Atomic Energy 
Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and 
the Commission’s rules and regulations. 
The Commission has made appropriate 
findings as required by the Act and the 
Commission’s rules and regulations in 
10 CFR chapter I, which are set forth in 
the license amendment. 
A notice of consideration of issuance 
of amendment to facility operating 
license or combined license, as 
applicable, proposed NSHC 
determination, and opportunity for a 
hearing in connection with these 
actions, were published in the Federal 
Register as indicated in the safety evaluation for each amendment. 
Unless otherwise indicated, the 
Commission has determined that these 
amendments satisfy the criteria for 
categorical exclusion in accordance 
with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant 
to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental 
impact statement or environmental 
assessment need be prepared for these 
amendments. If the Commission has 
prepared an environmental assessment 
under the special circumstances 
provision in 10 CFR 51.22(b) and has 
made a determination based on that 
assessment, it is so indicated in the 
safety evaluation for the amendment. 
For further details with respect to 
each action, see the amendment and 
associated documents such as the 
Commission’s letter and safety 
evaluation, which may be obtained 
using the ADAMS accession numbers 
indicated in the following table. The 
safety evaluation will provide the 
ADAMS accession numbers for the 
application for amendment and the 
Federal Register citation for any 
environmental assessment. All of these 
items can be accessed as described in 
the ‘‘Obtaining Information and 
Submitting Comments’’ section of this 
document.

rate testing program TS by: increasing the integrated leak rate test program interval; extend-
ing test intervals for Type A, B, and C leakage rate tests; extending the drywell-to-suppres-
sion chamber bypass leak rate test frequency; extending the frequency of containment isola-
tion valve leakage rate testing; and using American National Standards Institute/American 
Nuclear Society Standard 56.8–2020, ‘‘Containment System Leakage Testing Require-
ments.’’ The amendments also replaced certain guidance document references and deleted 
information regarding the performance of tests that have been successfully performed.

IV. Notice of Issuance of Amendment to 
Facility Operating Licenses and 
Combined Licenses and Final 
Determination of No Significant 
Hazards Consideration and 
Opportunity for a Hearing (Exigent 
Circumstances or Emergency Situation) 
Since publication of the last monthly 
notice, the Commission has issued the 
following amendment. The Commission 
has determined for this amendment that 
the application for the amendment 
complies with the standards and 
requirements of the Atomic Energy Act 
of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the 
Commission’s rules and regulations. 
The Commission has made appropriate 
findings as required by the Act and the 
Commission’s rules and regulations in 
10 CFR chapter I, which are set forth in 
the license amendment. 
Because of exigent circumstances or 
emergency situation associated with the 
date the amendment was needed, there 
was not time for the Commission to 
publish, for public comment before 
issuance, its usual notice of 
consideration of issuance of 
amendment, proposed NSHC 
determination, and opportunity for a 
hearing. 
For exigent circumstances, the 
Commission has either issued a Federal 
Register notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local 
media to provide notice to the public in 
the area surrounding a licensee’s facility 
of the licensee’s application and of the 
Commission’s proposed determination 
of NSHC. The Commission has provided 
a reasonable opportunity for the public 
to comment, using its best efforts to 
make available to the public means of 
communication for the public to 
respond quickly, and in the case of 
telephone comments, the comments 
have been recorded or transcribed as 
appropriate and the licensee has been 
informed of the public comments. 
In circumstances where failure to act 
in a timely way would have resulted, for 
example, in derating or shutdown of a 
nuclear power plant or in prevention of 
either resumption of operation or of 
increase in power output up to the 
plant’s licensed power level (an 
emergency situation), the Commission 
may not have had an opportunity to 
provide for public comment on its 
NSHC determination. In such case, the 
license amendment has been issued 
without opportunity for comment prior 
to issuance. Nonetheless, the State has 
been consulted by telephone whenever 
possible. 
Under its regulations, the Commission 
may issue and make an amendment 
immediately effective, notwithstanding 
the pendency before it of a request for 
a hearing from any person, in advance 
of the holding and completion of any 
required hearing, where it has 
determined that NSHC is involved. The 
Commission has applied the standards 
of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final 
determination that the amendments 
involve NSHC. The basis for this 
determination is contained in the NRC 
staff safety evaluation related to each 
action. Accordingly, the amendment has 
been issued and made effective as 
indicated. 
For those amendments that have not 
been previously noticed in the Federal 
Register, within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
persons (petitioner) whose interest may 
be affected by this action may file a 
request for a hearing and petition for 
leave to intervene (petition) with respect 
to the action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the guidance 
concerning the Commission’s ‘‘Agency 
Rules of Practice and Procedure’’ in 10 
CFR part 2 as discussed in section II.A 
of this document. 
Unless otherwise indicated, the 
Commission has determined that the 
amendment satisfies the criteria for 
categorical exclusion in accordance 
with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant 
to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental 
impact statement or environmental 
assessment need be prepared for this 
amendment. If the Commission has 
prepared an environmental assessment 
under the special circumstances 
provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has 
made a determination based on that 
assessment, it is so indicated in the 
safety evaluation for the amendment. 
For further details with respect to 
these actions, see the amendment and 
associated documents such as the 
Commission’s letter and safety 
evaluation, which may be obtained 
using the ADAMS accession numbers 
indicated in the following table. The 
safety evaluation will provide the 
ADAMS accession number(s) for the 
application for amendment and the 
Federal Register citation for any 
environmental assessment. All of these 
items can be accessed as described in 
the ‘‘Obtaining Information and 
Submitting Comments’’ section of this 
document.

Proposed Rule Change To Amend 
Exchange Rule 402, Criteria for 
Underlying Securities, To List and 
Trade Options on Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares 
December 18, 2025. 
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (‘‘Act’’)
1
and Rule 19b–4 
thereunder,
2
notice is hereby given that 
on December 5, 2025, MIAX Sapphire, 
LLC (‘‘MIAX Sapphire’’ or ‘‘Exchange’’) 
filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (‘‘Commission’’) a 
proposed rule change as described in 
Items I and II below, which Items have 
been prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Exchange Rule 402, Criteria for 
Underlying Securities, to permit options 
on Commodity-Based Trust Shares. 
Specifically, the Exchange proposes to 
amend the rule to (1) redefine 
Commodity-Based Trust; (2) require 
additional qualifying criteria, based on 
the criteria outlined by the primary 
listing market to list options on a 
Commodity-Based Trust; and (3) require 
that the crypto asset held by the 
Commodity-Based Trust have a 
comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement. This filing also defines a 
crypto asset. Additionally, this filing 
proposes to amend Exchange Rule 
403(g) to update the relevant citations to 
Exchange Rule 402, which are revised 
pursuant to this filing. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/ 
us-options/miax-sapphire/rule-filings 
and at the Exchange’s principal office. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
listing rules at Exchange Rule 402, 
Criteria for Underlying Securities.

Specifically, the Exchange proposes to 
amend the criteria for listing options on 
Exchange-Traded Fund Shares (‘‘ETFs’’) 
at Exchange Rule 402(i). This is a 
competitive filing substantively 
identical to the proposal submitted by 
Nasdaq ISE, LLC (‘‘ISE’’) to the

For example, a multi-coin ETF would not be 
subject to Exchange Rule 402(i)(6). For purposes of 
this rule the term ‘‘crypto asset’’ means an asset that 
is generated, issued and/or transferred using a 
blockchain or similar distributive ledger technology 
network, including but not limited to, assets known 
as ‘‘tokens,’’ ‘‘digital assets,’’ ‘‘virtual currencies,’’ 
and ‘‘coins’’ and that relies on cryptographic 
protocols. See definition at proposed Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(iii).

NASDAQ–2025–056; SR–CboeBZX–2025–104; SR– 
NYSEARCA–2025–54) (‘‘Generic Listing Standards

Exchange believes that it is appropriate to rely on 
the generic listing standards outlined by the 
primary listing market due to the potential 
proliferation of new primary listing markets and the 
Commission’s acknowledgment that the definition 
of shares of a Commodity-Based Trust across those 
primary listing markets is substantially identical.

in the Exchanges’ rules and are subject to the 
Exchanges’ existing rules governing the trading of

13
The Exchange proposes to renumber current 
Exchange Rules 402(i)(5)(i) and 402(i)(5)(ii) to 
Exchange Rules 402(i)(6)(i) and 402(i)(6)(ii) for ease

The Exchange initially filed SR– 
SAPPHIRE–2025–12, as Modified by 
Partial Amendment Nos. 1, 2 and 3 [sic], 
a proposed rule change to amend its 
listing rules at Exchange Rule 402, 
Criteria for Underlying Securities, to 
allow the listing and trading of options 
on interests in a Commodity-Based 
Trust on March 5, 2025, which was 
published in the Federal Registrar [sic] 
on March 19, 2025.
5
On April 25, 2025, 
the Commission issued a notice 
designating a longer period for 
Commission action, which designated 
June 17, 2025, as the date by which the 
Commission shall either approve or 
disapprove, or institute proceedings to 
determine whether to disapprove the 
filing.
6
On June 17, 2025, the 
Commission issued an order instituting 
proceedings to determine whether to 
approve or disapprove the filing.
7
The 
Commission did not receive any 
comments on the proposed rule change. 
On September 8, 2025, the Commission 
extended the time period for approving 
or disapproving the proposed rule 
changes, as modified by the applicable 
Partial Amendments, for an additional 
60 days, designating November 14, 2025 
as the date by which the Commission 
will either approve or disapprove the 
proposed rule change, as modified by 
the applicable Partial Amendments.
8
 
The Commission did not act to either 
approve or disapprove the proposal on 
or before November 14, 2025, therefore 
the proposal, as published in the 
Federal Register on March 5, 2025, was 
deemed approved as of November 14, 
2025.
9
On November 6, 2025, during the 
government shutdown, the Exchange 
submitted Amendment 3 to SR– 
SAPPHIRE–2025–12. The Exchange is 
now proposing the current change to 
reiterate the changes proposed in 
Amendment 3 to SR–SAPPHIRE–2025– 
12 to codify the proposed rule text in 
the Exchange’s Rulebook. 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Rule 402 to adopt new listing criteria in 
subparagraph (i)(6) to permit the listing 
and trading of options on a Commodity- 
Based Trust that meets the generic 
listing standards for Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares of the applicable primary 
listing market, except that the 
Commodity-Based Trust holds a single 
crypto asset.
10
 
On September 17, 2025, the 
Commission approved proposals by The 
Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, Cboe BZX 
Exchange, Inc. and NYSE Arca, Inc., to 
Adopt Generic Listing Standards for 
Commodity-Based Trusts.
11
In the 
approval order, the Commission noted 
that each of the exchanges proposed to 
adopt substantially identical ‘‘generic’’ 
listing standards for Commodity-Based 
Trusts. Those generic listing standards 
define the term shares of a ‘‘Commodity- 
Based Trust’’ as a security
12
that: 
(1) is issued by a trust, limited liability 
company, partnership, or other similar entity 
(‘‘Trust’’) that, if applicable, is operated by a 
registered commodity pool operator pursuant 
to the Commodity Exchange Act (‘‘CEA’’), 
and is not registered as an investment 
company pursuant to the Investment 
Company Act of 1940, or series or class 
thereof; 
(2) is designed to reflect the performance 
of one or more reference assets or an index 
of reference assets; 
(3) in order to reflect the performance, is 
issued by a Trust that holds (a) one or more 
commodities or commodity-based assets, and 
(b) in addition to such commodities or 
commodity-based assets, may hold securities, 
cash, and cash equivalents; 
(4) is issued by such Trust in a specified 
aggregate minimum number in return for a 
deposit of (a) a specified quantity of the 
underlying commodities, commodity-based 
assets, securities, cash, and/or cash 
equivalents or (b) a cash amount with a value 
based on the next determined net asset value 
per Trust share; and 
(5) when aggregated in the same specified 
minimum number, may be redeemed at a 
holder’s request by such Trust which will 
deliver to the redeeming holder (a) the 
specified quantity of the underlying 
commodities, commodity-based assets, 
securities, cash, and/or cash equivalents or 
(b) a cash amount with a value based on the 
next determined net asset value per Trust 
share. 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Exchange Rule 402(i) to create a new 
subparagraph (6)(iii) that states,

Commodity-Based Trust that meets the

Exchange Rule 402(a) provides that a security 
(which includes an ETF) on which options may be 
listed and traded on the Exchange must be a 
security registered (with the Commission) and be an 
NMS stock (as defined in Rule 600 of Regulation 
NMS under the Act), and the security shall be 
characterized by a substantial number of 
outstanding shares that are widely held and actively 
traded. 
15
Exchange Rule 402(b) provides criteria and 
guidelines when evaluating potential underlying 
securities for the listing of options. 
16
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(i)(B) provides that the 
Exchange-Traded Fund Shares are available for 
creation or redemption each business day from or 
through the issuing trust, investment company, 
commodity pool or other entity in cash or in kind 
at a price related to net asset value, and the issuer 
is obligated to issue Exchange-Traded Fund Shares 
in a specified aggregate number even if some or all 
of the investment assets and/or cash required to be 
deposited have not been received by the issuer, 
subject to the condition that the person obligated 
to deposit the investment assets has undertaken to 
deliver them as soon as possible and such 
undertaking is secured by the delivery and 
maintenance of collateral consisting of cash or cash 
equivalents satisfactory to the issuer of the 
Exchange-Traded Fund Shares, all as described in 
the Exchange-Traded Fund Shares’ prospectus. 
17
The market supply information can be obtained 
from publicly available sources such as 
coingecko.com or coinmarketcap.com. 18
For example, if Bitcoin were the underlying 
crypto asset, the Exchange would consider the total 
supply of all Bitcoin currently issued instead of the 
maximum supply, which would be currently issued 
as well as unminted Bitcoin. As of September 12, 
2025, Bitcoin’s total supply was 19,919,915 (the 
maximum supply was 21,000,000). See https://
www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin. The Exchange would calculate market value by utilizing 
the total supply number multiplied by the Bitcoin 
price on that day.

Exchange Rule 403(b)(5) provides, if an 
underlying security is approved for options listing 
and trading under the provisions of Rule 402(c), the 
trading volume of the Original Equity Security (as 
therein defined) prior to but not after the 
commencement of trading in the Restructure 
Security (as therein defined), including ‘‘when- 
issued’’ trading, may be taken into account in 
determining whether the trading volume 
requirement of subparagraph (3) is satisfied. 
21
See Exchange Rule 403(g). With this filing the Exchange is also proposing to amend Exchange 
Rule 403(g) to reflect the changes in numbering 
proposed herein for Exchange Rule 402(i). 
22
See id. 
23
Exchange Rule 403(b)(1) through (3) provides, 
if: (1) there are fewer than 6,300,000 shares of the 
underlying security held by persons other than 
those who are required to report their security 
holdings under Section 16(a) of the Act, (2) there 
are fewer than 1,600 holders of the underlying 
security, (3) the trading volume (in all markets in 
which the underlying security is traded) has been 
less than 1,800,000 shares in the preceding twelve 
(12) months. 
requirements of Exchange Rule 402(i)(6), the 
following requirements are satisfied: (A) the 
total global supply of the underlying crypto 
asset held by the Commodity-Based Trust has 
an average daily market value of at least $700 
million over the last 12 months; and (B) the 
crypto asset held by the Commodity-Based 
Trust underlies a derivatives contract that 
trades on a market with which the Exchange 
has a comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement, whether directly or through 
common membership in the Intermarket 
Surveillance Group. For purposes of this rule 
the term ‘‘crypto asset’’ means an asset that 
is generated, issued and/or transferred using 
a blockchain or similar distributive ledger 
technology network, including but not 
limited to, assets known as ‘‘tokens,’’ ‘‘digital 
assets,’’ ‘‘virtual currencies,’’ and ‘‘coins’’ 
and that relies on cryptographic protocols. 
The proposed additional criteria 
would require a Commodity-Based 
Trust to: (1) meet the generic criteria for 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares of the 
applicable primary listing market and 
hold only a single crypto asset; (2) meet 
the criteria and guidelines set forth in 
Exchange Rule 402(a)
14
and (b),
15
or 
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(i)(B);
16
and 
meet the requirements in 402(i)(6)(iii) 
prior to listing options on the 
Commodity-Based Trust. 
As proposed, Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6)(iii) requires Commodity-Based 
Trust that meets the requirements of 
402(i)(6) to also satisfy the following 
requirements: (A) the total global supply 
of the underlying crypto asset held by 
the Commodity-Based Trust has an 
average daily market value of at least 
$700 million over the last 12 months; 
and (B) the crypto asset held by the 
Commodity-Based Trust underlies a 
derivatives contract that trades on a 
market with which the Exchange has a 
comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement, whether directly or through 
common membership in the Intermarket 
Surveillance Group (‘‘ISG’’). 
The Exchange defines a ‘‘crypto asset’’ 
at Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(iii) to mean, 
for purposes of this rule, an asset that 
is generated, issued and/or transferred 
using a blockchain or similar 
distributive ledger technology network, 
including but not limited to, assets 
known as ‘‘tokens,’’ ‘‘digital assets,’’ 
‘‘virtual currencies,’’ and ‘‘coins’’ and 
that relies on cryptographic protocols. 
The market value of the underlying 
crypto asset will be calculated by taking 
the total global supply of the particular 
crypto asset multiplied by the token 
price.
17
Total supply of crypto assets 
includes all crypto assets currently 
issued and does not include unissued 
crypto assets.
18
 
Further, the Exchange has specified in 
proposed Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(iii) 
that the crypto asset held by the 
Commodity-Based Trust must underlie a 
derivatives contract that trades on a 
market with which the Exchange has a 
comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement, whether directly or through 
common membership in ISG.
19
The 
Exchange will be required to ensure that 
this requirement is met prior to listing 
options on a Commodity-Based Trust 
pursuant to proposed Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6). 
As a result of this filing, the proposed 
listing criteria would permit a 
Commodity Based Trust that is 
generically listed on the applicable 
primary listing market and holds a 
single crypto asset to qualify for the 
listing of options on that ETF, provided 
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(iii) has also 
been met, as well as the listing criteria 
in Exchange Rule 402(a) and (b), or 
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(i)(B). 
Similar to options on any ETF, an 
option on a Commodity-Based Trust 
that meets the requirements of Exchange 
Rule 402(i)(6) would also be subject to 
the Exchange’s continued listing 
standards for options on ETFs set forth 
in Exchange Rule 403(g). Pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 403(g), ETFs approved 
for options trading pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 402(i) will not be 
deemed to meet the requirements for 
continued approval, and the Exchange 
shall not open for trading any additional 
series of option contracts of the class 
covering that such ETFs, if the ETFs are 
delisted from trading pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 403(b)(4),
20
are halted or 
suspended from trading in their primary 
market.
21
Additionally, options on ETFs 
may be subject to the suspension of 
opening transactions in any of the 
following circumstances:
22
 
(1) in the case of options covering ETFs 
approved for trading under Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6)(i)(A), in accordance with the terms 
of paragraphs (b)(1), (2), and (3) of Exchange 
Rule 403;
23
 
(2) in the case of options covering ETFs 
approved for trading under Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6)(i)(B), following the initial twelve- 
month period beginning upon the 
commencement of trading in the ETFs on a 
national securities exchange and are defined 
as an NMS stock, there are fewer than 50 
record and/or beneficial holders of such ETFs 
for 30 or more consecutive trading days; 
(3) the value of the index or portfolio of 
securities, non-U.S. currency, or portfolio of 
commodities including commodity futures 
contracts, options on commodity futures 
contracts, swaps, forward contracts and/or 
options on physical commodities and/or 
financial instruments and money market 
instruments on which the ETFs are based is 
no longer calculated or available; or 
(4) such other event shall occur or 
condition exist that in the opinion of the 
Exchange makes further dealing in such 
options on the Exchange inadvisable. 
Consistent with current Exchange 
Rule 404, which governs the opening of 
options series on a specific underlying 
security (including ETFs), the Exchange 
will open at least one expiration

See Exchange Rule 404(b). The monthly expirations are subject to certain listing criteria for 
underlying securities described within Exchange 
Rule 404 and its Interpretations and Policies. 
Monthly listings expire the third Friday of the 
month. The term ‘‘expiration date’’ (unless 
separately defined elsewhere in the OCC By-Laws), 
when used in respect of an option contract (subject 
to certain exceptions), means the third Friday of the 
expiration month of such option contract, or if such 
Friday is a day on which the exchange on which 
such option is listed is not open for business, the 
preceding day on which such exchange is open for 
business. See OCC By-Laws Article I, Section 1. Pursuant to Exchange Rule 404(c), additional series 
of options of the same class may be opened for 
trading on the Exchange when the Exchange deems 
it necessary to maintain an orderly market, to meet 
customer demand or when the market price of the 
underlying stock moves more than five strike prices 
from the initial exercise price or prices. Pursuant 
to Exchange Rule 404(e), new series of options on 
an individual stock may be added until the 
beginning of the month in which the options 
contract will expire. Due to unusual market 
conditions, the Exchange, in its discretion, may add 
a new series of options on an individual stock until 
the close of trading on the business day prior to 
expiration.

the time they are listed.
28
 
Pursuant to Exchange Rule 404, 
Interpretation and Policy .06, which 
governs strike prices of series of options 
on ETFs, the interval between strike 
prices of series of options on ETFs 
approved for options trading pursuant 
to Exchange Rule 402(i) shall be fixed at 
a price per share which is reasonably 
close to the price per share at which the 
underlying security is traded in the 
primary market at or about the same 
time such series of options is first open 
for trading on the Exchange, or at such 
intervals as may have been established 
on another options exchange prior to the 
initiation of trading on the Exchange. 
With respect to the Short Term Options 
Series or Weekly Program, during the 
month prior to expiration of an option 
class that is selected for the Short Term 
Option Series Program, the strike price 
intervals for the related non-Short Term 
Option (‘‘Related non-Short Term 
Option’’) shall be the same as the strike 
price intervals for the Short Term 
Option.
29
Specifically, the Exchange 
may open for trading Short Term Option 
Series at strike price intervals of (i) 
$0.50 or greater where the strike price 
is less than $100, and $1 or greater 
where the strike price is between $100 
and $150 for all option classes that 
participate in the Short Term Options 
Series Program; (ii) $0.50 for option 
classes that trade in one dollar 
increments and are in the Short Term 
Option Series Program; or (iii) $2.50 or 
greater where the strike price is above 
$150.
30
Additionally, the Exchange may 
list series of options pursuant to the $1 
Strike Price Interval Program,
31
the 
$0.50 Strike Program,
32
and the $2.50 
Strike Price Program.
33
Pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 510, where the price of 
a series of options on a Commodity- 
Based Trust is less than $3.00, the 
minimum increment will be $0.05, and 
where the price is $3.00 or higher, the 
minimum increment will be $0.10
34
 
consistent with the minimum 
increments for options on other ETFs 
listed on the Exchange. Any and all new 
series of a [sic] Commodity-Based Trust 
options that the Exchange lists will be 
consistent and comply with the 
expirations, strike prices, and minimum 
increments set forth in Rules 404 and 
510, as applicable. 
Further, options on a [sic] 
Commodity-Based Trusts that are 
approved subject to Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6) would trade in the same 
manner as options on other ETFs on the 
Exchange. The Exchange Rules that 
currently apply to the listing and 
trading of all options on ETFs on the 
Exchange, including, for example, Rules 
that govern listing criteria, expirations, 
exercise prices, minimum increments, 
position and exercise limits, margin 
requirements, customer accounts and 
trading halt procedures would apply to 
the listing and trading of options on 
Commodity-Based Trusts that are 
approved subject to Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6) in the same manner. 
Position and exercise limits for 
options on Commodity-Based Trusts 
that are approved pursuant to Exchange 
Rule 402(i)(6) would be determined 
pursuant to Exchange Rules 307 and 
309, respectively, as is the case for other 
options on other ETFs. Position and 
exercise limits for options on ETF vary 
according to the number of outstanding 
shares and the trading volumes of the 
underlying ETF over the past six 
months, where the largest in 
capitalization and the most frequently 
traded ETFs have an option position 
and exercise limits of 250,000 contracts 
(with adjustments for splits, re- 
capitalizations, etc.) on the same side of 
the market; and smaller capitalization 
ETFs have position and exercise limits 
of 200,000, 75,000, 50,000 or 25,000 
contracts (with adjustments for splits, 
re-capitalizations, etc.) on the same side 
of the market. Further, Exchange Rule 
1502, which governs margin 
requirements applicable to trading on 
the Exchange, including options on 
ETFs, will also apply to the trading of 
options on a [sic] Commodity-Based 
Trusts listed pursuant to Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6). 
The Exchange represents that the 
same surveillance procedures applicable 
to all other options on other ETFs 
currently listed and traded on the 
Exchange will apply to the trading of 
options on Commodity-Based Trusts 
that are approved subject to Exchange 
Rule 402(i)(6).
35
The Exchange 
represents that it has the necessary 
systems capacity to support the new 
option series. The Exchange believes 
that its existing surveillance and 
reporting safeguards are designed to 
deter and detect possible manipulative 
behavior which might potentially arise 
from listing and trading options on 
ETFs, including the listing of options on 
Commodity-Based Trusts that are 
approved subject to Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6). Also, the Exchange may obtain 
information from designated contract 
markets that are members of the ISG 
related to a financial instrument that is 
based, in whole or in part, upon an 
interest in or performance of a crypto 
asset, as applicable. The Exchange has 
specified in proposed Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6) that the crypto asset held by 
the Commodity-Based Trust must 
underlie a derivatives contract that 
trades on a market with which the 
Exchange has a comprehensive 
surveillance sharing agreement, whether 
directly or through common 
membership in ISG.
36
The Exchange 
will be required to ensure that this 
requirement is met prior to listing 
options on a Commodity- Based Trust 
listed pursuant to proposed Exchange 
Rule 402(i)(6). 
Additionally, the Exchange has also 
analyzed its capacity and represents that

it believes the Exchange and the 
Options Price Reporting Authority or 
‘‘OPRA’’ have the necessary systems 
capacity to handle the additional traffic 
associated with the listing of new series 
of ETFs, including options on a [sic] 
Commodity-Based Trusts, that are 
approved subject to Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6), up to the number of 
expirations currently permissible under 
the Exchange Rules. 
Finally, today, the Exchange lists and 
trades options on ETFs that would 
qualify for listing as an option on a 
Commodity-Based Trust under 
proposed Exchange Rule 402(i)(6),
37
and 
it has not identified any issues with the 
listing and trading of options on those 
ETFs. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the Act 
and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
38
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5)
39
requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged 
in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, 
and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
40
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
In particular, the Exchange believes 
that its proposal to establish new listing 
criteria at Exchange Rule 402(i)(6) with 
respect to options on Commodity-Based 
Trusts, without the need for additional 
approvals, will remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system and, in general, protect investors 
because it would allow the Exchange to 
immediately list and trade qualifying 
options on Commodity-Based Trusts, 
provided the initial listing criteria has 
been met, without any additional 
approvals from the Commission. 
Specifically, the Exchange’s proposal 
to adopt Exchange Rule 402(i)(6) to 
allow the listing and trading of options 
on units that represent interests in 
Commodity- Based Trusts that meet the 
generic listing standards for 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares of the 
applicable primary listing market,
41
and 
hold a single crypto asset, is consistent 
with the Act because it will permit the 
Exchange to offer options on 
Commodity-Based Trusts soon after the 
listing of the ETF on the primary listing 
market, provided that all the generic 
listing standards for that Commodity- 
Based Trust on that primary listing 
market have been met. Listing these 
options will avail market participants of 
the opportunity to hedge their positions 
in the Commodity-Based Trusts in a 
timely manner, thereby providing 
investors with the ability to hedge their 
exposure to the underlying Commodity- 
Based Trust. Options on Commodity- 
Based Trusts benefits investors, similar 
to the listing of any other option on an 
ETF, by providing investors with a 
relatively lower-cost risk management 
tool to manage their positions and 
associated risk in their portfolios more 
easily in connection with exposure to 
the price of a crypto asset. Additionally, 
listing options on Commodity-Based 
Trusts provides investors with the 
ability to transact in such options on a 
listed market as opposed to the OTC 
options market, which increases market 
transparency and enhances the process 
of price discovery to the benefit of all 
investors. 
Also, this proposal would permit 
options on Commodity-Based Trusts to 
be listed on the Exchange in the same 
manner as all other securities that are 
subject to the current listing criteria in 
Exchange Rule 402. The Exchange notes 
that the majority of ETFs are able to list 
and trade options once the initial listing 
criteria have been met without the need 
for additional approvals. The proposed 
rule change would allow options on 
certain Commodity-Based Trusts to 
likewise list and trade options once the 
initial listing criteria on the primary 
listing market have been met without 
the need for additional approvals. 
As proposed, the Exchange would list 
options in a Commodity-Based Trust 
that met the generic criteria of the 
applicable primary listing market, 
provided the Commodity-Based Trust 
held only a single crypto asset. Further, 
these options on Commodity-Based 
Trusts would also be required to satisfy 
the conditions in proposed Exchange 
Rule 402(i)(6)(iii). Specifically, a 
Commodity-Based Trust that met the 
requirements of proposed Exchange 
Rule 402(i)(6) would also have to satisfy 
the following requirements in proposed 
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(iii): (A) the total 
global supply of the underlying crypto 
asset held by the Commodity-Based 
Trust has an average daily market value 
of at least $700 million over the last 12 
months; and (B) the crypto asset held by 
the Commodity-Based Trust underlies a 
derivatives contract that trades on a 
market with which the Exchange has a 
comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement, whether directly or through 
common membership in the ISG. 
These requirements are consistent 
with the Act and the protection of 
investors as they should ensure that the 
underlying ETF has sufficient liquidity 
prior to listing options, which will serve 
to prevent disruption to the underlying 
market. The Exchange believes that 
market supply serves as a good measure 
of liquidity to prevent the addition of 
options trading on the Commodity- 
Based Trust from disrupting the market 
for the underlying security. Requiring 
the underlying crypto asset to have a 
requisite amount of deliverable supply, 
in addition to all the other criteria the 
ETF is required to have under the 
applicable primary listing market rules, 
should ensure adequate liquidity prior 
to listing. Further, ensuring the crypto 
asset held by the Commodity-Based 
Trust underlies a derivatives contract 
that trades on a market with which the 
Exchange has a comprehensive 
surveillance sharing agreement, whether 
directly or through common 
membership in the ISG, will provide the 
Exchange with information to 
adequately surveillance options on 
qualifying Commodity-Based Trusts. 
Today, the Exchange has a 
comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement in place with both the CME 
and Coinbase Derivatives through its 
common membership in ISG. This 
facilitates the sharing of information 
that is available to the CME and 
Coinbase Derivatives through their 
surveillance of their respective markets, 
including their surveillance of their 
respective digital asset futures markets. 
The Exchange also believes the 
proposed rule change will remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, because 
it is consistent with current Exchange 
Rules, previously filed with the

Commission. Options on qualifying 
Commodity-Based Trusts must satisfy 
the initial listing standards and 
continued listing standards currently in 
the Exchange Rules applicable to 
options on all ETFs, including ETFs that 
hold other crypto assets already deemed 
appropriate for options trading on the 
Exchange in addition to the proposed 
criteria. Options on qualifying 
Commodity-Based Trusts would trade in 
the same manner as any other ETF 
options—the same Exchange Rules that 
currently govern the listing and trading 
of all ETF options, including 
permissible expirations, strike prices 
and minimum increments, and 
applicable position and exercise limits 
and margin requirements, will govern 
the listing and trading of options on 
qualifying Commodity-Based Trusts. 
The Exchange represents that it has 
the necessary systems capacity to 
support the listing and trading of 
options on qualifying Commodity-Based 
Trusts. The Exchange believes that its 
existing surveillance and reporting 
safeguards are designed to deter and 
detect possible manipulative behavior 
which might arise from listing and 
trading of these options on Commodity- 
Based Trust, particularly in light of the 
additional requirement that the crypto 
asset held by the Commodity-Based 
Trust underlies a derivatives contract 
that trades on a market with which the 
Exchange has a comprehensive 
surveillance sharing agreement, whether 
directly or through common 
membership in ISG. 
Finally, today, the Exchange lists and 
trades options on ETFs that would 
qualify for listing as an option on a 
Commodity-Based Trust under 
proposed Exchange Rule 402(i)(6),
42
and 
it has not identified any issues with the 
listing and trading of options on those 
ETFs. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. In this regard 
and as indicated above, the Exchange 
notes that the rule change is being 
proposed as a competitive response to 
the filing submitted by ISE.
43
 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposal to amend the listing 
criteria at Exchange Rule 402(i)(6), with 
respect to ETFs, to adopt new criteria to 
permit the listing and trading of options 
on certain Commodity-Based Trusts that 
hold a single crypto asset and that were 
listed pursuant to the generic listing 
standards for Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares of the applicable primary listing 
market, without the need for additional 
approvals, will impose any burden on 
intramarket competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. Options on 
qualifying Commodity-Based Trusts 
would need to satisfy the initial listing 
standards set forth in the Exchange 
Rules in the same manner as any other 
ETF before the Exchange could list 
options on them. Additionally, options 
on qualifying Commodity-Based Trusts 
will be equally available to all market 
participants who wish to trade such 
options. The Exchange Rules currently 
applicable to the listing and trading of 
options on ETFs on the Exchange will 
apply in the same manner to the listing 
and trading of all options on qualifying 
Commodity-Based Trusts. 
Additionally, the Exchange notes that 
listing and trading options on qualifying 
Commodity-Based Trusts on the 
Exchange will subject such options to 
transparent exchange based rules as 
well as price discovery and liquidity, as 
opposed to alternatively trading such 
options in the OTC market. The 
Exchange believes that the proposed 
rule change may relieve any burden on, 
or otherwise promote, competition as it 
is designed to increase competition for 
order flow on the Exchange in a manner 
that is beneficial to investors by 
providing them with a lower-cost option 
to hedge their investment portfolios in 
a timely manner. 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposal to adopt new listing 
criteria at Exchange Rule 402(i)(6) to 
permit the listing and trading of certain 
options on a Commodity-Based Trust, 
without the need for additional 
approvals, will impose any burden on 
intermarket competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. Other 
options exchanges are free to amend 
their applicable rules to permit them to 
list and trade options on Commodity- 
Based Trusts. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
Written comments were neither 
solicited nor received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: (i) significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant 
burden on competition; and (iii) become 
operative for 30 days from the date on 
which it was filed, or such shorter time 
as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
44
and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b–4 
thereunder.
45
 
A proposed rule change filed under 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
46
normally does not 
become operative prior to 30 days after 
the date of the filing. However, pursuant 
to Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii),
47
the 
Commission may designate a shorter 
time if such action is consistent with 
protection of investors and the public 
interest. The Exchange has asked the 
Commission to waive the 30-day 
operative delay so that the proposed 
rule change may become operative 
immediately upon filing. The 
Commission believes that waiving 30- 
day operative delay is consistent with 
the protection of investors and the 
public interest because the proposal 
seeks to amend the Exchange’s rules to 
be consistent with an amendment filed 
by the Exchange during a government 
shutdown, and which would have 
replaced the proposed rule change that 
did become effective if the Commission 
could have received amendments 
during the pendency of the government 
shutdown.
48
The proposal also aligns 
the rule text relating to Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares with the rule text of 
other exchanges and does not introduce 
any novel regulatory issues.
49
 
Accordingly, the Commission

(44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities

Rule 300(a) of Regulation ATS provides that an 
ATS is ‘‘any organization, association, person, 
group of persons, or system: (1) [t]hat constitutes, 
maintains, or provides a market place or facilities 
for bringing together purchasers and sellers of 
securities or for otherwise performing with respect 
to securities the functions commonly performed by

Act Rule 3b–16]; and (2) [t]hat does not: (i) [s]et

shall preserve the records specified in Rule 303 of 
Regulation ATS. Rule 303 requires an ATS to 
preserve, among other things, all records required 
to be made pursuant to Rule 302 for a period of not

Exchange Act 
Rule 3a1–1(a)(2) exempts from the 
definition of ‘‘exchange’’ under section 
3(a)(1) an organization, association, or 
group of persons that complies with 
Regulation ATS.
5
Regulation ATS 
requires an ATS to, among other things, 
register as a broker-dealer with the 
Commission, file a Form ATS or Form 
ATS–N with the Commission to notice 
its operations, and establish written 
safeguards and procedures to protect 
subscribers’ confidential trading 
information. An ATS that complies with 
Regulation ATS and operates pursuant 
to the Rule 3a1–1(a)(2) exemption 
would not be required by section 5 to 
register as a national securities 
exchange. 
To comply with the condition set 
forth in Rule 301(b)(8) of Regulation 
ATS (17 CFR 242.301(b)(8)), an ATS 
must make and keep current certain 
records relating to trading activity set 
forth in Rule 302 of Regulation ATS (17 
CFR 242.302).
6
Under Rule 302, ATSs 
are required to, among other things, 
make a record of subscribers to the ATS, 
daily summaries of trading in the ATS, 
and time-sequenced records of order 
information in the ATS. 
The information required to be 
collected under Rule 302 should 
increase the abilities of the Commission, 
state securities regulatory authorities, 
and the self-regulatory organizations to 
ensure that ATSs are in compliance 
with Regulation ATS as well as other 
applicable rules and regulations. If the 
information is not collected or collected 
less frequently, the regulators would be 
limited in their ability to comply with 
their statutory obligations, provide for 
the protection of investors, and promote 
the maintenance of fair and orderly 
markets. 
Respondents consist of ATSs that 
choose to operate pursuant to the 
exemption provided by Regulation ATS 
from registration as national securities 
exchanges. There are currently 111 
respondents. These respondents will 
spend a total of approximately 4,773 
hours per year (111 respondents at 43 
burden hours/respondent) to comply 
with the recordkeeping requirements of 
Rule 302. At an average cost per burden 
hour of $89, the resultant total related 
total internal cost of compliance for 
these respondents is approximately 
$424,797 per year (4,773 burden hours 
multiplied by $89/hour). 
An agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
Control Number. 
Written comments are invited on: (a) 
whether this proposed collection of 
information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the SEC, 
including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of 
the SEC’s estimate of the burden 
imposed by the proposed collection of 
information, including the validity of 
the methodology and the assumptions 
used; (c) ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize 
the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including 
through the use of automated, electronic 
collection techniques or other forms of 
information technology.

The Exchange notes MGTN options are eligible 
for the Monthly Options Series program pursuant 
to Rule 4.13(a)(2)(C), which permits p.m.-settled 
options that expire on the last trading day of the 
month (as do options with EOM expirations). The 
Exchange proposes to make these options eligible

Nonstandard Expiration for consistency since the 
Exchange is proposing to make these options

The Exchange notes MGTN options are 
currently eligible for the Quarterly Options Series 
program pursuant to Rule 4.13(a)(2)(B), which 
permits P.M.-settled options that expire on the last

II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change, as Modified by Amendment 
No. 1 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Rules 4.13 and 5.1. First, the Exchange 
proposes to amend Rule 4.13(e), which 
governs its Nonstandard Expirations 
Program (‘‘Program’’), to permit P.M.- 
settled options on the Cboe Magnificent 
10 Index (‘‘MGTN options’’) that expire 
any Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
Thursday, or Friday (other than the 
third Friday-of-the-month (‘‘Expiration 
Friday’’) or days that coincide with an 
end-of-month expiration) (‘‘Weekly 
Expirations’’) and that expire on the last 
trading day of the month (‘‘EOMs’’). 
Currently, under this Program, the 
Exchange is permitted to list P.M.- 
settled options on any broad-based 
index eligible for standard trading and 
the Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index 
(‘‘CBTX’’) and the Mini-Cboe Bitcoin 
U.S. ETF Index (‘‘MBTX’’) (which are 
narrow-based indexes) that expire on: 
(1) any Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
Thursday, or Friday (other than the 
third Friday-of-the-month or days that 
coincide with an EOM expiration) and 
(2) the last trading day of the month.
6
 
The proposal expands the availability of 
Weekly and EOM expirations to MGTN 
options, which are narrow-based index 
options eligible for standard options 
trading.
7
 
The Nonstandard Expiration Program 
will apply to MGTN options in the same 
manner as it currently applies to other 
index options. Weekly and EOM 
Expirations are subject to all provisions 
of Rule 4.13 and treated the same as 
options on the same underlying index 
that expire on the third Friday of the 
expiration month; provided, however, 
that Weekly and EOM Expirations are 
P.M.-settled, and new series in Weekly 
and EOM Expirations may be added up 
to and including on the expiration date 
for an expiring Weekly or EOM 
Expiration. 
The maximum number of expirations 
that may be listed for each Weekly 
Expiration (i.e., a Monday expiration, Tuesday expiration, Wednesday 
expiration, Thursday expiration, or 
Friday expiration, as applicable) and 
each EOM expiration in a given class is 
the same as the maximum number of 
expirations permitted in Rule 4.13(a)(2) 
for standard options on the same index 
(which is currently six for MGTN 
options). Weekly Expirations need not 
be for consecutive Monday, Tuesday, 
Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday 
expirations as applicable; however, the 
expiration date of a nonconsecutive 
expiration may not be beyond what 
would be considered the last expiration 
date if the maximum number of 
expirations were listed consecutively. 
Weekly Expirations that are first listed 
in a given class may expire up to four 
weeks from the actual listing date. 
Similarly, EOM expirations need not be 
for consecutive end of month 
expirations; however, the expiration 
date of a nonconsecutive expiration may 
not be beyond what would be 
considered the last expiration date if the 
maximum number of expirations were 
listed consecutively. EOM Expirations 
that are first listed in a given class may 
expire up to four weeks from the actual 
listing date. If the Exchange lists EOMs 
and Weekly Expirations in a given class, 
the Exchange will list an EOM instead 
of a Weekly Expiration that expires on 
the same day in the given class. Other 
expirations in the same class are not 
counted as part of the maximum 
number of Weekly or EOM Expirations 
for an applicable index class. 
If the Exchange is not open for 
business on a respective Monday, the 
normally Monday expiring Weekly 
Expirations will expire on the following 
business day. If the Exchange is not 
open for business on a respective 
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or 
Friday, the normally Tuesday, 
Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday 
expiring Weekly Expirations will expire 
on the previous business day. If two 
different Weekly Expirations on an 
index would expire on the same day 
because the Exchange is not open for 
business on a certain weekday, the 
Exchange will list only one of such 
Weekly Expirations. In addition, 
pursuant to Rule 4.13(e)(3), transactions 
in expiring index options with Weekly 
and EOM Expirations may be effected 
on the Exchange between the hours of 
9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on their last 
trading day (Eastern Time). 
Second, the Exchange proposes to 
amend Rule 4.13(c), which governs 
quarterly index expirations (‘‘QIXs’’), to 
add MGTN options to the list of options 
in Rule 4.13(c) that are eligible for 
quarterly index expirations (‘‘QIXs’’), 
which are currently available for 
options on the S&P 100 Index (‘‘OEX 
options’’), S&P 500 Index (‘‘SPX 
options’’), Mini-S&P 500 Index (‘‘XSP 
options’’), S&P 500 Equal Weight Index 
(full-value) (‘‘SPEQ options’’), S&P 500 
Equal Weight Index (1/10th reduced- 
value) (‘‘SPEQX options’’), Russell 2000 
Index (‘‘RUT options’’), Mini-Russell 
2000 Index (‘‘MRUT options’’), CBTX 
options, and MBTX options.
8
Pursuant 
to Rule 4.13(c), there may be up to eight 
near-term quarterly expirations open for 
trading in a class, and these options will 
be P.M.-settled. The QIX program will 
apply to MGTN options in the same 
manner as it currently applies to the 
other options currently eligible for those 
expirations. QIXs are subject to all 
provisions of Rule 4.13 and treated the 
same as options on the same underlying 
index that expire on the third Friday of 
the expiration month, except that QIXs, 
are P.M.-settled. 
Third, the Exchange proposes to 
amend Rule 4.13, Interpretation and 
Policy .13, to permit the listing of P.M.- 
settled MGTN options that expire on 
Expiration Fridays. Currently, pursuant 
to Rule 4.13, Interpretation and Policy 
.13, the Exchange is permitted to list 
P.M.-settled SPX options, XSP options, 
SPEQ options, SPEQX options, RUT 
options, MRUT options, CBTX options, 
and MBTX options that expire on 
Expiration Fridays. Combined with the 
proposed rule change above to permit 
the Exchange to list P.M.-settled MGTN 
options with Weekly Expirations, the

10
Current Rule 5.1(b)(2)(C) would apply to MGTN 
options with Nonstandard Expirations and QIXs, as 
proposed; therefore, the addition of MGTN P.M.- 
settled options to the list of options set forth in this 
Rule covers these options that expire on Expiration 
Fridays.

See Rule 4.13(a)(2)(C) and (B), respectively. 14
The Exchange currently may list Weekly, EOM, 
QIX, and Expiration Friday P.M.-Settled Expirations 
for SPX, XSP, RUT, MRUT, CBTX, and MBTX 
options. 
Exchange would be permitted to list 
P.M.-settled MGTN options with 
expirations on all Fridays (in addition to 
all other days of the week). MGTN 
options that are P.M.-settled and expire 
on Expiration Fridays are subject to all 
provisions of Rule 4.13 and treated the 
same as A.M.-settled MGTN options, 
except that they are P.M.-settled. 
Finally, the Exchange proposes to 
amend Rule 5.1, which governs trading 
days and hours, in conjunction with the 
proposed addition of MGTN options 
that are P.M.-settled and expire on 
Expiration Friday. Rule 5.1(b)(2)(C) 
currently provides that on their last 
trading day, Regular Trading Hours for 
index options with Nonstandard 
Expirations, as well as expiring P.M.- 
settled SPX, XSP, RUT, MRUT, CBTX, 
and MBTX options, may be effected on 
the Exchange between 9:30 a.m. and 
4:00 p.m. Eastern Time
9
(as opposed to 
the 9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Regular 
Trading Hours for options with those 
expirations that are non-expiring). The 
proposed rule change amends Rule 
5.1(b)(2)(C) to include MGTN P.M.- 
settled options.
10
The primary listing 
markets for the component securities 
that comprise the Cboe Magnificent 10 
Index close trading in those securities at 
4:00 p.m., just as the primary listing 
markets for the component securities 
that comprise the S&P 500, Mini-S&P 
500, Russell 2000, Mini-Russell 2000, 
Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF, and Cboe Mini- 
Bitcoin U.S. ETF Indexes close trading 
at 4:00 p.m. The primary listing 
exchanges for the component securities 
disseminate closing prices for the 
component securities, which are used to 
calculate the exercise settlement value 
of these indexes. The Exchange believes 
that, under normal trading 
circumstances, the primary listing 
markets have sufficient bandwidth to 
prevent any data queuing that may 
cause any trades that are executed prior 
to the closing time from being reported 
after 4:00 p.m. If trading in expiring 
MGTN P.M.-settled options continued 
an additional fifteen minutes until 4:15 
p.m. on their last trading day, these 
expiring options would be trading after 
the settlement index value for those 
expiring options was calculated. 
Therefore, in order to mitigate potential 
investor confusion and the potential for 
increased costs to investors as a result 
of potential pricing divergence at the 
end of the trading day, the Exchange 
believes that it is appropriate to cease 
trading in the expiring MGTN P.M.- 
Settled options at 4:00 p.m., as it 
already does for expiring P.M.-settled 
SPX, XSP, RUT, MRUT, CBTX, and 
MBTX options that expire on Expiration 
Fridays and for expiring indexes with 
Nonstandard Expirations (which are 
P.M.-settled) for the same 
aforementioned reasons.
11
The 
Exchange does not believe that the 
proposed rule change will impact 
volatility on the underlying cash market 
comprising the Cboe Magnificent 10 
Index at the close on Expiration Fridays, 
as it already closes trading on the last 
trading day for expiring P.M.-settled 
index options at 4:00 p.m., which the 
Exchange does not believe has had an 
adverse impact on fair and orderly 
markets on Expiration Fridays for the 
underlying securities comprising the 
corresponding indexes.
12
 
As noted above, current Rules permit 
the Exchange to list P.M.-settled MGTN 
options with expirations on the last 
calendar of the month and quarter.
13
As 
a result, it is already possible under the 
Rules for options on the Cboe 
Magnificent 10 Index to be P.M.-settled 
and to expire on any day of the week (as 
the end of the month or the end of a 
quarter may fall on any day of the 
week). The Rules also already allow 
options on the Cboe Magnificent 10 
Index to expire on Thursdays for 
normally Friday expiring options when 
the Exchange is not open for business 
on a respective Friday. Further, options 
on the Cboe Magnificent 10 Index will 
be available for FLEX trading pursuant 
to Rule 4.20 upon initial listing on the 
Exchange, which would permit market 
participants to select expiration dates 
for these FLEX options for any day of 
the week and may select p.m.- 
settlement. 
The Exchange believes that the 
introduction of Weekly Expirations and 
Expiration Friday expirations for 
options on the Cboe Magnificent 10 
Index that are P.M.-settled will provide 
market participants with additional 
hedging tools and greater trading 
opportunities, regardless of in which 
index option market they participate. By 
offering expanded expirations along 
with the current standard A.M.-settled 
expirations (as well as P.M.-settled 
monthly and quarterly expirations), the 
proposed rule change will allow market 
participants to purchase options on the 
Cboe Magnificent 10 Index available for 
trading on the Exchange in a manner 
more aligned with specific timing needs 
(such as to hedge special events) and 
more effectively tailor their investment 
and hedging strategies and manage their 
portfolios. In particular, the proposed 
rule change will allow market 
participants to roll their positions on 
more trading days, thus with more 
precision, spread risk across more 
trading days and incorporate daily 
changes in the markets, which may 
reduce the premium cost of buying 
protection. For example, the Exchange 
believes that market participants may 
pay for more protection than they need 
if they are seeking to hedge weekend or 
special event risk that occurs. Therefore, 
the Exchange believes that P.M.-settled 
daily expirations (including on all 
Fridays) would allow market 
participants to purchase an option based 
on their needed timing and allow them 
to tailor their investment or hedging 
needs more effectively. In addition, 
because P.M.-settlement permits trading 
throughout the day on the day the 
contract expires, the Exchange believes 
this will permit market participants to 
more effectively manage overnight risk 
and trade out of their positions up until 
the time the contract settles. 
The Exchange believes there is 
sufficient investor interest and demand 
in Weekly Expirations and Expiration 
Friday P.M.-settled expirations for 
options on the Cboe Magnificent 10 
Index to warrant inclusion in the 
Program and in the Rules, and that the 
Program and the Rules, as amended, 
will continue to provide investors with 
additional means of managing their risk 
exposures and carrying out their 
investment objectives.
14
 
With regard to the impact of this 
proposal on system capacity, the 
Exchange has analyzed its capacity and 
represents that it believes that the 
Exchange and OPRA have the necessary 
systems capacity to handle any potential 
additional traffic associated with trading 
of P.M.-settled Weekly and Expiration 
Friday expirations for MGTN options. 
The Exchange does not believe that its

Pursuant to Rule 8.32(f), positions in 
Nonstandard Expiration Program, QIXs, and P.M.- 
Settled Third Friday Index Options series are 
aggregated with positions in options contracts in 
the same index class. Therefore, MGTN options 
positions that have Nonstandard Expirations, QIXs, 
and third-Friday P.M.-settlement will be aggregated 
for purposes of position limits with positions in 
MGTN options, respectively with other expirations 
(including short-term, monthly, and quarterly 
expirations). This is consistent with the treatment 
of positions for purposes of position limits for other 
classes that participate in the Nonstandard 
Expiration Program, as well as QIXs and P.M.- 
Settled Third Fridays. See Rule 8.31(b). Pursuant to Rule 8.32(a) and 8.42(b) (which provides that the 
exercise limits for index options are equivalent to 
the position limits set forth in Rule 8.32), the 
current position and exercise limits for MGTN 
options are 24,000 contracts (and may not be more 
than 31,500 without rule changes). Therefore, 
investors would not be able to maintain significant 
open interest in these options, which may further 
prevent investors from being able to impact the 
value of the index.

Options on the Cboe Magnificent 10 Index may 
already be listed with P.M.-settlement and 
expirations on the last calendar day of the month 
or quarter pursuant to Rule 4.13(a)(2)(C) and (B), 
respectively; therefore, the additional series that 
this proposed rule would permit to be listed are 
P.M.-settled Weeklys and Expiration Friday 
expirations. The proposed rule change merely adds 
these options to different programs within the Rules 
that permit these same expirations for consistency 
within the Rules. 
20
The Exchange’s affiliate, the Cboe Futures 
Exchange, LLC (‘‘CFE’’), currently lists MGTN 
futures. 
21
For example, it may be confusing to list 
Weeklys under the Nonstandard Expirations 
Program but monthlys under the Monthly program 
Continued 
Trading Permit Holders (‘‘TPHs’’) will 
experience any capacity issues as a 
result of this proposal and represents 
that it will monitor the trading volume 
associated with any possible additional 
series of options on the Cboe 
Magnificent 10 Index listed as a result 
of this proposal and the effect (if any) 
of these additional series on market 
fragmentation and on the capacity of the 
Exchange’s automated systems. 
In addition to this, the Exchange 
believes that its existing surveillance 
and reporting safeguards in place are 
adequate to deter and detect possible 
manipulative behavior which might 
arise from listing and trading MGTN 
options with Weekly Expirations or 
Expiration Friday expirations (as the 
Exchange currently applies these 
surveillances to other options that are 
P.M.-settled with these expirations and 
would for MGTN options that are P.M.- 
settled with monthly and quarterly 
expirations pursuant to current Rules) 
and will support the protection of 
investors and the public interest. 
Furthermore, the trading of MGTN 
options with Weekly and Expiration 
Friday expirations will be subject to the 
same rules that currently govern the 
trading of options on the Cboe 
Magnificent 10 Index with other 
expirations, including governing 
customer accounts, position and 
exercise limits,
15
margin requirements 
and trading halt procedures, among 
other Rules, which are designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative 
acts and practices. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’) and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
16
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5)
17
requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged 
in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, 
and facilitation transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
18
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
In particular, the Exchange believes 
that the proposed rule change will 
remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest. The Exchange believes 
that the introduction of P.M.-settled 
Weekly and Expiration Friday 
expirations for MGTN options will 
provide investors with expanded 
hedging tools and greater trading 
opportunities and flexibility for an 
additional index option.
19
As a result, 
investors will have additional means to 
manage their risk exposures and carry 
out their investment objectives. By 
offering expanded expirations for 
options on the Cboe Magnificent 10 
Index (along with the currently 
available P.M.-settled monthly and 
quarterly options and standard A.M.- 
settled options), the proposed rule 
change will allow market participants to 
purchase options on an additional index 
in a manner more aligned with specific 
timing needs and more effectively tailor 
their investment and hedging strategies 
and manage their portfolios. For 
example, the proposed rule change will 
allow market participants to roll their 
positions in options on the Cboe 
Magnificent 10 Index on more trading 
days, thus with more precision, spread 
risk across more trading days and 
incorporate daily changes in the 
markets, which may reduce the 
premium cost of buying protection. The 
Exchange represents that it believes that 
it has the necessary systems capacity to 
support any additional traffic associated 
with trading of options on the Cboe 
Magnificent 10 Index with Weekly and 
Expiration Friday (P.M.-settled) 
expirations and does not believe that its 
TPHs will experience any capacity 
issues as a result of this proposal. 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the addition of MGTN options to the 
Nonstandard Expirations Program, to 
the P.M.-settled Expiration Friday 
program, or the QIX program will raise 
any prohibitive regulatory concerns, nor 
adversely impact fair and orderly 
markets on expiration days. The 
Exchange has not experienced any 
meaningful regulatory concerns, nor 
adverse impact on fair and orderly 
markets, in connection with these 
programs and is unaware of any reason 
why adding P.M.-settled options with 
expirations each day of the week for 
MGTN options would be create such 
concerns or impact. Particularly, the 
Exchange does not believe increases in 
the number of P.M.-settled options 
series and expirations will have any 
significant adverse economic impact on 
the futures, index, or underlying index 
component securities markets.
20
The 
Exchange believes that the proposed 
rule change will provide investors with 
greater trading and hedging 
opportunities and flexibility, allowing 
them to transact in options on the Cboe 
Magnificent 10 Index in a manner more 
aligned with specific timing needs and 
more effectively tailor their investment 
and hedging objectives by listing these 
options that expire each trading day of 
the week, in addition to options that 
expire at the end of calendar month and 
quarter (which, as noted above, current 
Rules already permit the Exchange to 
do). 
As also discussed above, current 
Rules permit the Exchange to list P.M.- 
settled options on the Cboe Magnificent 
10 Index that expire on the last calendar 
day of the month and quarter; the 
proposed rule change merely permits 
these listings to occur under different 
programs within the Rules for 
consistency within the Exchange’s 
Rules.
21
Therefore, it is already possible

The index is designed to measure the price 
return of a group of large capitalization U.S. 
technology and growth-oriented companies and are 
intended to be among the most actively traded 
stocks. Pursuant to the methodology for the Cboe 
Magnificent 10 Index, each component will have a 
market capitalization of at least $500,000,000, a free 
float of at least 25%, a minimum of 1,000,000 
shares trading volume in the preceding six months, 
and one of the 100 largest market capitalizations. 
The Exchange notes the market capitalizations of 
the current ten constituents range from 
approximately 257,334,000,000 to 
4,321,000,000,000 and are within the top 34 among 
listed stocks, the minimum free float of the 
constituents is approximately 84.1%, and the six- 
month trading volume ranges from approximately 
787,775,000,000 to 4,262,320,000,000. Additionally, 
the narrow-based listing criteria pursuant to which 
these index options are listed impose various 
requirements on the component securities related to 
the market capitalization and liquidity, which 
further reduce the risk that the markets for the 
components would be impacted by additional 
derivatives. For example, pursuant to Rule 4.10(b): 
(1) the market capitalization for the lowest- 
weighted component securities in the index that in 
the aggregate account for no more than 10% of the 
weight of the index must be at least $50 million, 
and the market capitalization of all other 
components must be at least $75 million; (2) the 
trading volume in each component must be at least 
1,000,000 shares for each of the last six months 
(from October 2024 through March 2025, the lowest 
monthly trading volume for a component was over 
1.5 million shares), except that for each of the 
lowest-weighted component securities in the index 
that in the aggregate account for no more than 10% 
of the weight the index, the trading volume must 
be at least 500,000 shares for each of the last six 
months); and (3) no single component security may 
represent more than 25% of the weight of the index, 
and the five highest-weighted component securities 
in the index may not in the aggregate account for 
more than 50% (60% for an index consisting of 
fewer than 25 component securities) of the weight 
of the index. 
26
See id. 
under the Rules for options on the Cboe 
Magnificent 10 Index to be P.M.-settled 
and to expire on any day of the week (as 
the end of the month or the end of a 
quarter may fall on any day of the 
week). The Rules also already allow 
options on the Cboe Magnificent 10 
Index to expire on Thursdays for 
normally Friday expiring options when 
the Exchange is not open for business 
on a respective Friday. Further, options 
on the Cboe Magnificent 10 Index will 
be available for FLEX trading pursuant 
to Rule 4.20 when the Exchange begins 
listing these options, and thus, market 
participants will be able to select 
expiration dates for these FLEX options 
for any day of the week and may select 
p.m.-settlement. The Exchange has no 
reason to believe this proposed rule 
change will cause any significant 
adverse economic impact on the futures, 
index, or underlying index component 
securities markets as a result of these 
listings. 
The Commission previously 
recognized that listing P.M.-settled 
index options with Weekly Expirations 
and Expiration Friday expirations (in 
addition to EOM Expirations (which 
would include expirations on the last 
day of calendar quarters)) was 
consistent with the Act.
22
The 
Commission noted that expirations in 
those index options would ‘‘offer 
additional investment options to 
investors and may be useful for their 
investment or hedging objectives 
....’’
23
The Exchange also notes it 
previously listed P.M.-settled broad- 
based index options with Weekly, EOM, 
and Expiration Friday expirations 
pursuant to pilot programs, so the 
Commission could monitor the impact 
of P.M.-settlement of cash-settled index 
derivatives on the underlying cash 
markets (while recognizing that these 
risks may have been mitigated given 
enhanced closing procedures in use in 
the primary equity markets); however, 
the Commission approved proposed 
rule changes to make those pilot 
programs permanent. The Commission 
noted that the data it reviewed in 
connection with the pilot demonstrated 
that these options ‘‘benefitted investors 
and other market participants by 
providing more flexible trading and 
hedging opportunities while also having 
no disruptive impact on the market’’ 
and were thus consistent with the Act.

The proposed rule change is consistent 
with these findings, as it will benefit 
investors and other market participants 
that participate in the markets for 
additional index options in the same 
manner by providing them with more 
flexible trading and hedging 
opportunities. 
Further, the Exchange believes P.M.- 
settlement is appropriate for options on 
the Cboe Magnificent 10 Index because 
they will be trading within a complex of 
other correlated instruments that track 
the performance of the underlying 
components, in addition to the 
underlying components themselves 
(e.g., options on the components, ETFs that track the most active stocks 
(including the components), and futures 
on the Cboe Magnificent 10 Index). This 
reduces the risk that listing these 
options would strain liquidity 
providers. Further, the size of the 
markets of the underlying 
components
25
and the equal weighting 
of the components make it unlikely the 
proposed rule change would materially 
impact the component markets, the 
index value, or the broader market. 
As is the case for options on other 
indexes eligible for P.M.-settlement 
(including broad-based and narrow- 
based indexes), the Exchange does not 
believe the listing of additional P.M.- 
settled options on the Cboe Magnificent 
10 Index (which are narrow-based index 
options) will have any significant 
economic impact (such as on market 
quality or volatility) on the component 
securities underlying the index 
surrounding the close as a result of 
expiring p.m.-settled options or impact 
market quality. This is based on the data 
provided to and reviewed by the 
Commission (and the Commission’s 
own conclusions with respect to broad- 
based indexes based on that review, as 
noted above) and due to the significant 
changes in closing procedures in the 
decades since index options moved to 
a.m.-settlement.
26
The Exchange 
believes the potential for any such 
impact is not only no greater for narrow- 
based indexes than broad-based 
indexes, but may be less likely for 
narrow-based indexes such as the Cboe 
Magnificent 10 Index, as the indexes 
underlying such options are by 
definition not representative of an entire 
market (as is the case for options on the 
S&P 500 Index). Therefore, any potential 
impact would likely be limited in scope 
(as noted above, the Commission found 
no material impact with respect to P.M.- 
settled broad-based index options). 
Therefore, because, as noted above, the 
Commission found no material impact 
with respect to broad-based index 
options, the Exchange believes that it is 
reasonable to infer that no material 
impact would occur with respect to 
MGTN options for the reasons described 
above (including the significant

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60153 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Notices 27
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34157 (June 3, 1994), 59 FR 30062 (June 10, 1994) (SR– 
Amex–92–35, SR–CBOE–93–59, SR–NYSE–94–17, 
SR–PSE–94–07, and SR–Phlx–94–10). The 
Commission made substantially similar findings 
with respect to generic listing criteria for broad- 
based index options. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 53266 (February 9, 2006), 71 FR 8321 
(February 16, 2006) (SR–CBOE–2005–59) (the 
Commission noted that the listing criteria were 
‘‘designed to ensure that the markets for the index’s 
component stocks are adequately capitalized and 
sufficiently liquid, and that no one stock dominates 
the index’’ and thus ‘‘minimize the potential for 
manipulating the underlying index’’). 
28
See Rule 8.31(b). liquidity of the components and 
correlation of the component securities 
and the availability of multiple 
correlated instruments for hedging). The 
Exchange believes this to be particularly 
true given that the components of the 
Cboe Magnificent 10 Index are also 
components of the S&P 500 Index, 
which was the index the Commission 
considered in those findings. The 
narrow scope of narrow-based indexes 
aligns closer to the scope of equity 
options (which are P.M.-settled, such as 
the options overlying the constituent 
securities that comprise the Cboe 
Magnificent 10 Index). 
Further, the Cboe Magnificent 10 
Index satisfies the generic listing criteria 
in Rule 4.10(b). Upon approval of those 
listing criteria, the Commission noted 
that these generic standards were 
reasonably designed to ensure the 
protection of investors and the public 
interest and to ensure that the trading 
markets for the components were 
adequately capitalized and sufficiently 
liquid, and that no one component 
dominated the index, thus minimizing 
the potential for manipulation.
27
This 
listing criteria includes the following: 
€each component security has a market capitalization of at least $75 
million, except that for each of the 
lowest weighted component securities 
in the index that in the aggregate 
account for no more than 10% of the 
weight of the index, the market 
capitalization is at least $50 million; 
€trading volume of each component security has been at least one million 
shares for each of the last six months, 
except that for each of the lowest 
weighted component securities in the 
index that in the aggregate account for 
no more than 10% of the weight of the 
index, trading volume has been at least 
500,000 shares for each of the last six 
months; 
€in a capitalization-weighted index or a modified capitalization-weighted 
index, the lesser of the five highest 
weighted component securities in the 
index or the highest weighted 
component securities in the index that 
in the aggregate represent at least 30% 
of the total number of component 
securities in the index each have had an 
average monthly trading volume of at 
least 2,000,000 shares over the past six 
months; 
€no single component security represents more than 25% of the weight 
of the index, and the five highest 
weighted component securities in the 
index do not in the aggregate account 
for more than 50% (60% for an index 
consisting of fewer than 25 component 
securities) of the weight of the index; 
and 
€component securities that account for at least 90% of the weight of the 
index and at least 80% of the total 
number of component securities in the 
index satisfy the requirements of Rule 
4.3 applicable to individual underlying 
securities. 
Additionally, as described above, the 
constituents of the Cboe Magnificent 10 
Index are large, highly capitalized, and 
heavily traded, which further reduce the 
potential for manipulation of the index. 
Therefore, by satisfying the generic 
listing criteria for narrow-based index 
options, the Cboe Magnificent 10 Index 
is, like broad-based indexes and the 
narrow-based Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF 
and Cboe Mini-Bitcoin U.S. ETF 
Indexes, designed to minimize the 
potential for manipulation, further 
reducing any potential concerns 
associated with P.M.-settlement. 
Further, the Exchange believes that 
because MGTN options listed with 
Nonstandard Expirations, QIXs, and 
P.M.-settlement on Third Fridays will 
be aggregated with other options within 
those classes for purposes of position 
(and exercise) limits, will further 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative 
acts and practices and to promote just 
and equitable principles of trade, and 
thus protect investors. This aggregation 
is consistent with the treatment of 
positions for purposes of position (and 
exercise) limits for other classes that 
may be listed with Nonstandard 
Expirations, QIXs, and third Friday 
p.m.-settlement.
28
Therefore, the current 
position and exercise limits that apply 
to options on the Cboe Magnificent 10 
Index will continue to apply, as the 
proposed additional expirations for 
these options would have no impact on 
the number of positions that may be 
held (or exercised) within a single 
account. 
In addition, the Exchange believes 
that the proposal to end trading at 4:00 
p.m. on the last trading day for 
transactions in expiring P.M.-settled 
MGTN options will prevent continued 
trading on a product after the exercise 
settlement value has been fixed, thereby 
mitigating potential investor confusion 
and the potential for increased costs to 
investors as a result of potential pricing 
divergence at the end of the trading day. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
Exchange does not believe that the 
proposed rule change will impose any 
burden on intramarket competition that 
is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act 
because P.M.-settled options on the 
Cboe Magnificent 10 Index with Weekly 
and Expiration Friday expirations will 
be available to all market participants. 
By listing options on the Cboe 
Magnificent 10 Index with these 
expirations (in addition to the monthly, 
quarterly, and standard Expiration 
Friday expirations (A.M.-settled) that 
are currently permitted under the 
Rules), the proposed rule change will 
provide all investors that participate in 
the markets for these index options 
available for trading on the Exchange 
with greater trading and hedging 
opportunities and flexibility to meet 
their investment and hedging needs, 
which are already available for several 
other index options (both broad-based 
and narrow-based). Further, the 
proposed change to make options on the 
Cboe Magnificent 10 Index that are 
P.M.-settled and expire on the last 
business day of the month or quarter 
eligible for listing under different 
programs under the Rules will have any 
burden on competition, as this proposed 
rule change is intended to maintain 
consistency within the Rules and will 
result in the same series being listed. 
The proposed 4:00 p.m. closing time for 
expiring P.M.-settled MGTN options on 
their expiration dates will apply equally 
to all market participants trading these 
options. 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposal to list P.M.-options on the 
Cboe Magnificent 10 Index with Weekly 
and Expiration Friday expirations will 
impose any burden on intermarket 
competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act because these 
options are proprietary Exchange 
products. The Exchange may currently 
list the same expirations for other index 
options, so the proposed rule change 
merely expands the availability of these 
expiration programs to additional 
products. Other exchanges offer similar 
expirations for index options as well as 
short-term options programs for certain

products with similar expirations. To 
the extent that the addition of these 
expirations for options on the Cboe

Exchange a more attractive marketplace 
to market participants at other 
exchanges, such market participants are 
free to elect to become market 
participants on the Exchange. 
Additionally, options on the Cboe 
Magnificent 10 Index with these 
expirations will trade in the same 
manner as other options with these 
expirations currently do. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received comments on the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Discussion and Commission 
Findings 
After careful review, the Commission 
finds that the proposed rule change, as 
modified by Amendment No. 1, is 
consistent with the Act and the rules 
and regulations thereunder applicable to 
a national securities exchange.
30
In 
particular, the Commission finds that 
the proposed rule change, as modified 
by Amendment No. 1, is consistent with 
Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
31
which 
requires, among other things, that the 
Exchange’s rules be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest. 
In evaluating whether this proposal is 
consistent with Section 6(b)(5), and, in 
particular, whether it is designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative 
acts and practices and to protect 
investors and the public interest, the 
Commission considered the potential 
impacts of p.m.-settled, cash-settled 
options on the underlying cash equities 
markets, and in particular, the potential 
for added market volatility and sharp 
price movements near the close on 
expiration days. The Commission has 
had concerns about the adverse effects 
and impact of p.m.-settlement upon 
market volatility and the operation of 
fair and orderly markets on the 
underlying cash market at or near the 
close of trading on expiration days.
32
 
However, the Commission approved 
proposals from several exchanges, 
including the Exchange, to permanently 
establish programs permitting the listing 
and trading of certain p.m.-settled 
broad-based index options.
33
In 
approving these proposals, the 
Commission reviewed data provided by 
the exchanges in their filings, the 
exchanges’ pilot data and reports, as 
well as an analysis conducted at the 
direction of Staff from the Commission’s 
Division of Economic and Risk Analysis 
and concluded that analysis of the pilot 
data did not identify any significant 
economic impact on the underlying 
component securities surrounding the 
close as a result of expiring p.m.-settled 
options nor did it indicate a 
deterioration in market quality for an 
existing product when a new p.m.- 
settled expiration was introduced.
34
 
Further, the Commission stated that 
significant changes in closing 
procedures in the decades since index 
options moved to a.m.-settlement may 
also serve to mitigate the potential 
impact of p.m.-settled index options on 
the underlying cash markets.
35
In 
addition, in September 2025, the 
Commission approved the listing of 
p.m.-settled options on two narrow- 
based indexes—CBTX and MBTX—with 
Weekly Expirations, EOM expirations, 
Expiration Friday expirations and QIX 
expirations.
36
 
In support of this proposal, the 
Exchange states that it does not believe 
that the proposal would adversely 
impact fair and orderly markets on 
expiration days.
37
The Exchange 
explains that it has not experienced any 
meaningful regulatory concerns, nor 
adverse impact on fair and orderly 
markets, in connection with its 
Nonstandard Expirations Program, 
Expiration Friday expirations, or QIX 
program.
38
 
The Exchange states that p.m.- 
settlement is appropriate for MGTN 
options for several reasons. According 
to the Exchange, the size of the markets 
of the underlying components
39
and the 
equal weighting of the components 
make it unlikely that the proposal 
would result in a material impact on the 
component markets, the index value, or 
the broader market.
40
The Exchange 
states that MGTN is ‘‘designed to 
measure the price return of a group of 
large capitalization U.S. technology and 
growth-oriented companies and are 
intended to be among the most actively 
traded stocks,’’
41
and that ‘‘each [index] 
component will have a market 
capitalization of at least $500,000,000, a 
free float of at least 25%, a minimum of 
1,000,000 shares trading volume in the 
preceding six months, one of the 100 
largest market capitalizations, and one 
of the highest six-month aggregate dollar 
values of average daily trading 
volume.’’
42
In Amendment No. 1, the 
Exchange provides market capitalization 
and trading volume ranges for the 
current ten index components.
43
The 
Exchange also states that MGTN options 
will trade within a complex of other 
correlated instruments that track the 
performance of the underlying 
components, in addition to the 
underlying components—such as 
options on the underlying components,

ETFs that trade the most active stocks 
(including the components), and MGTN 
futures—and that this reduces the risk 
that listing these options would strain 
liquidity providers or materially impact 
the component markets, the index 
value, or the broader market.
44
 
As noted above, in evaluating the 
proposals permitting the listing and 
trading of other p.m.-settled index 
options, the Commission evaluated the 
potential for negative impacts on the 
underlying component securities of the 
indexes and on options market 
quality.
45
In its approval of p.m.-settled 
CBTX and MBTX options, the 
Commission observed that the index 
components for CBTX and MBTX trade 
within a complex with multiple highly 
correlated instruments available for 
hedging and that the underlying 
components of the indexes are generally 
highly liquid and closely correlated 
with one another.
46
The Commission 
stated that, as a result, it would be 
unlikely for p.m.-settled options on 
CBTX and MBTX to increase market and 
price volatility in the underlying index 
components or in the CBTX and MBTX 
options market.
47
The index 
components for MGTN similarly trade 
within a complex of other correlated 
instruments that track the performance 
of the underlying components, in 
addition to the underlying 
components—such as options on the 
underlying components, ETFs that trade 
the most active stocks (including the 
components), and MGTN futures. 
Further, the index components have 
large market capitalizations and the 
trading markets for the components are 
highly liquid.
48
As a result, it would be 
unlikely for p.m.-settled MGTN options 
to increase market and price volatility in 
the underlying index components or in 
the market for MGTN options. 
The Exchange’s proposal to expand 
the Nonstandard Expirations Program 
and the QIX program to MGTN options 
and make the options eligible for p.m.- 
settled Expiration Friday expirations, is 
a reasonably designed expansion of 
existing p.m.-settled index option 
programs that may provide the investing 
public and other market participants 
with more flexible trading and hedging 
opportunities. Further, pursuant to Rule 
8.32(a) and 8.42(b), MGTN options are 
subject to position and exercise limits of 
24,000 contracts (and may not be more 
than 31,500 without rule changes),
49
 
and p.m.-settled MGTN options would 
be subject to Rule 8.32(f), which 
provides that positions in the 
Nonstandard Expirations Program 
series, QIXs, and P.M.-Settled Third 
Friday Index Options will be aggregated 
with positions in options contracts in 
the same index class.
50
Therefore 
positions in MGTN options would be 
aggregated across expirations in the 
same class, which could reduce the 
potential incentives to manipulate or 
disrupt the underlying market to benefit 
the options position and would not 
allow the maintenance of significant 
open interest in the options. The 
Exchange also represents that it has a 
surveillance program in place to 
monitor trading in the proposed p.m.- 
settled MGTN options and the systems 
capacity to support the proposed new 
options series.
51
The Commission 
expects the Exchange to continue to 
monitor any potential risks from large 
P.M.-settled positions and take 
appropriate action on a timely basis if 
warranted. 
For the foregoing reasons, the 
Commission finds that the proposed 
rule change is consistent with Section 
6(b)(5) of the Act
52
and the rules and 
regulations thereunder applicable to a 
national securities exchange. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments on 
Amendment No. 1 to the Proposed Rule 
Change

V. Accelerated Approval of Proposed 
Rule Change, as Modified and 
Superseded by Amendment No. 1 
The Commission finds good cause to 
approve the proposed rule change, as 
modified by Amendment No. 1, prior to 
the thirtieth day after the date of 
publication of notice of the filing of 
Amendment No. 1 in the Federal 
Register. Amendment No. 1 updates the 
proposed rule change to reflect 
Commission approval of changes to the 
rule text made by a separate filing,
53
and 
adds market capitalization and trading 
volume ranges for the current MGTN 
index component securities.
54
 
Amendment No. 1 makes no substantive 
changes to the proposed rule change. 
Accordingly, the Commission finds 
good cause, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) 
of the Act,
55
to approve the proposed 
rule change, as modified by Amendment 
No. 1, on an accelerated basis prior to 
the 30th day after publication of notice 
of the filing of Amendment No. 1 in the 
Federal Register. 
VI. Conclusion

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Cboe 
BZX Exchange, Inc.; Notice of Filing 
and Immediate Effectiveness of a 
Proposed Rule Change To Permit the 
Exchange To Extend the Quote-Only 
Period 
December 18, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
16, 2025, Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the 
‘‘Exchange’’ or ‘‘BZX’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I and II 
below, which Items have been 
substantially prepared by the Exchange. 
The Exchange filed the proposal as a 
‘‘non-controversial’’ proposed rule 
change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
3
and Rule 
19b–4(f)(6) thereunder.
4
The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange is filing with the 
Commission a proposal to permit the 
Exchange to extend the Quote-Only 
Period
5
where there is a security that is 
the subject of an initial pricing on the 
Exchange that has not been listed on a 
national securities exchange 
immediately prior to the initial pricing. 
The text of the proposed rule change is 
provided in Exhibit 5. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is also available on the Commission’s 
website (https://www.sec.gov/rules/ 
sro.shtml), the Exchange’s website 
(https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/ 
regulation/rule_filings/bzx/), and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to add a new 
subsection (vi) to Rule 11.23(d)(2)(B) to 
permit the Exchange to extend the 
Quote-Only Period where there is a 
security that is the subject of an initial 
pricing on the Exchange that has not 
been listed on a national securities 
exchange immediately prior to the 
initial pricing. The proposed ability to 
extend the Quote-Only Period is 
substantively identical to capabilities on 
other exchanges.
6
The Exchange 
believes this proposal reinforces the 
Exchange’s broad discretionary 
authority over the initial and continued 
listing of securities.
7
 
Exchange Rule 11.23(d)(2) sets forth 
the IPO and Halt Auction Process. 
Specifically, Rule 11.23(d)(2)(B) 
provides that the Quote-Only Period for 
an IPO Auction
8
may be extended in 
five specific instances: (i) there are 
unmatched market orders on the 
Auction Book
9
associated with the 
auction; (ii) the underwriter requests an 
extension; (iii) where the Indicative 
Price
10
moves the greater of 10% or fifty 
(50) cents in the fifteen (15) seconds 
prior to the auction; (iv) in the event of 
a technical or systems issue at the 
Exchange that may impair the ability of 
Users
11
to participate in the IPO 
Auction or of the Exchange to complete 
the IPO Auction; or (v) where a 
Derivative Security
12
fails to meet the 
Exchange’s listing qualification 
requirements as set forth in Rule 14.11. 
Now, the Exchange proposes to adopt 
Rule 11.23(d)(2)(B)(vi) which would 
provide that the Quote-Only Period may 
be extended where there is a security 
that is the subject of an initial pricing 
on the Exchange that has not been listed 
on a national securities exchange 
immediately prior to the initial pricing. 
NYSE American LLC (‘‘NYSE 
American’’) Rule 7.18E(e) states ‘‘[t]he 
Exchange may declare a regulatory halt 
in a security that is the subject of an 
initial pricing on the Exchange of a 
security that has not been listed on a 
national securities exchange 
immediately prior to the initial pricing. 
This regulatory halt will be terminated 
when the security opens.’’ This proposal 
is identical to the NYSE American rule 
except that the NYSE American rule 
references a regulatory halt instead of 
extension of the Quote-Only Period. 
Additionally, the Exchange is proposing 
slightly different language than the 
NYSE American rule to clarify that the 
rule only references one security. 
Further, the Exchange is proposing to 
not include reference to the extension 
period being terminated when the 
security opens, as this language is 
redundant with respect to the 
Exchange’s rules. While NYSE 
American’s rule references a regulatory 
halt and additional language, the 
Exchange’s approach of extending the 
Quote-Only Period achieves the same 
protective purpose through a 
mechanism that is consistent with the 
Exchange’s existing auction framework 
under Rule 11.23(d)(2)(B). Additionally, 
this proposal is identical to NYSE Arca, 
Inc. (‘‘Arca’’) Rule 7.18–E(b)(1)(B)(i)
13
 
and Nasdaq Rule 4120(a)(7).
14
Initial 
pricings of securities without prior 
exchange listing history can be subject 
to heightened volatility and uncertainty, 
particularly where there may be 
significant public interest or rapidly

changing market conditions. This 
authority complements the existing 
extension provisions in Rule 
11.23(d)(2)(B) and provides an 
additional safeguard specifically 
tailored to the unique circumstances of 
initial pricings. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the Act 
and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
15
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with 
Section6(b)(5)
16
requirements that the 
rules of an exchange be designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative 
acts and practices, to promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, to foster 
cooperation and coordination with 
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, 
settling, processing information with 
respect to, and facilitating transactions 
in securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
17
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
In particular, the Exchange believes 
that proposed Rule 11.23(d)(2)(B)(vi) 
will remove impediments to and perfect 
the mechanism of a free and open 
market and a national market system by 
providing the Exchange with necessary 
operational flexibility to ensure orderly 
opening auctions for newly listed 
securities that have not been listed on 
a national securities exchange 
immediately prior to the initial pricing. 
The proposed rule change clarifies the 
Exchange’s broad authority over initial 
and continued listings, including ETPs 
subject to an IPO. This authority allows 
the Exchange to extend the Quote-Only 
Period when necessary to prevent 
disorderly openings and ensure that the 
initial price is established through a fair 
and transparent process. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public 
interest because it clarifies the 
Exchange’s broad authority over initial 
and continued listings, including ETPs 
subject to an IPO. This authority allows 
the Exchange to extend the Quote-Only 
Period when necessary to prevent 
disorderly openings and ensure that the 
initial price is established through a fair 
and transparent process. Initial pricings 
of securities without prior exchange 
listing history can be subject to 
significant public interest or rapidly 
changing market conditions. This 
authority complements the existing 
extension provisions in Rule 
11.23(d)(2)(B) and provides an 
additional safeguard specifically 
tailored to the unique circumstances of 
initial pricing. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
requirement that the rules of an 
exchange not be designed to permit 
unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers 
because the proposed extension 
authority will apply uniformly to all 
securities that are subject to an initial 
pricing on the Exchange and have not 
been listed on a national securities 
exchange immediately prior to the 
initial pricing. The Exchange’s 
discretion to extend the Quote-Only 
Period will be exercised to facilitate the 
orderly establishment of an initial price, 
and all market participants will benefit 
equally from any additional time 
provided during an extended Quote- 
Only Period. The extension mechanism 
is transparent and consistent with the 
Exchange’s existing auction procedures 
and discretionary authority under Rule 
11.23(d)(2)(B). 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on intramarket competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act 
because the proposed extension 
authority will apply uniformly to all 
securities that are subject to an initial 
pricing on the Exchange and have not 
been listed on a national securities 
exchange immediately prior to the 
initial pricing. The Exchange’s 
discretion to extend the Quote-Only 
Period will be exercised to facilitate the 
orderly establishment of an initial price, 
and all market participants will benefit 
equally from any additional time 
provided during an extended Quote- 
Only Period. The proposed rule change 
does not benefit or burden any specific 
type of market participant, as it applies 
equally to all Users and their customers 
participating in IPO Auctions on the 
Exchange. 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on intermarket competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
The proposed rule change does not 
affect the ability of other exchanges to 
conduct opening auctions for their 
listed securities or the manner in which 
they choose to manage their auction 
processes. Market participants on other 
exchanges are welcome to seek listings 
on the Exchange if they determine that 
this proposed rule change has made the 
Exchange more attractive or favorable as 
a listing venue. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received comments on the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) 
of the Act
18
and paragraph (f) of Rule 
19b–4
19
thereunder. Because the 
foregoing proposed rule change does 
not: (i) significantly affect the protection 
of investors or the public interest; (ii) 
impose any significant burden on 
competition; and (iii) become operative 
for 30 days from the date on which it 
was filed, or such shorter time as the 
Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
20
and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b–4 
thereunder.
21
 
A proposed rule change filed under 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
22
under the Act does 
not normally become operative prior to 
30 days after the date of the filing. 
However, pursuant to Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6)(iii),
23
the Commission may 
designate a shorter time if such action 
is consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest. The 
Exchange has requested that the 
Commission waive the 30-day operative 
delay so that the proposal may become 
operative immediately upon filing. The 
Exchange states that the proposed rule 
change does not significantly affect the 
protection of investors or the public 
interest and will benefit investors and

For purposes only of waiving the 30-day 
operative delay, the Commission has also 
considered the proposed rule’s impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 
15 U.S.C. 78c(f).

The term ‘‘Order’’ means an instruction to trade 
a specified number of shares in a specified System 
Security submitted to the Nasdaq Market Center by 
a Participant. An ‘‘Order Type’’ is a standardized 
set of instructions associated with an Order that 
define how it will behave with respect to pricing, 
execution, and/or posting to the Nasdaq Book when 
submitted to Nasdaq. See Nasdaq Equity 1, Section 1(a)(7). The Nasdaq Book is a montage for quotes 
and orders that collects and ranks all quotes and 
orders submitted by Participants. See Nasdaq Equity 1, Section 1(a)(3)(A). 
4
An ‘‘Order Attribute’’ is a further set of variable 
instructions that may be associated with an Order 
to further define how it will behave with respect to 
pricing, execution, and/or posting to the Nasdaq 
Book when submitted to Nasdaq. The available 
Order Types and Order Attributes, and the Order 
Attributes that may be associated with particular 
the public interest because the proposal 
will provide the Exchange with 
operational flexibility to ensure orderly 
opening auctions for newly listed 
securities that have not been listed on 
a national securities exchange 
immediately prior to the initial pricing. 
The Exchange further states that by 
exercising its discretion to extend the 
Quote-Only Period during initial 
pricings, the Exchange will be able to 
allow additional time for market 
participants to assess pricing 
information, submit or modify orders, 
and ensure that the opening price is 
established through a fair and 
transparent process. The Exchange 
believes that this discretionary authority 
is particularly important for securities 
without prior exchange trading history, 
where price discovery may require 
additional time and there is no reference 
price from prior trading activity. 
The Commission believes that waiver 
of the operative delay could benefit 
investors by allowing the Exchange 
additional flexibility to offer more time 
in connection with initial pricing for 
securities with no prior exchange listing 
history. In addition, the proposal does 
not present any unique or novel 
regulatory issues because similar 
functionality is currently in place on 
other national securities exchanges. 
Therefore, the Commission believes that 
waiver of the 30-day operative delay is 
consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest. 
Accordingly, the Commission hereby 
waives the 30-day operative delay and 
designates the proposed rule change as 
operative upon filing.
24
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments

change is consistent with the Act.

Order Attributes is Time-in-Force 
(‘‘TIF’’).
5
The TIF assigned to an Order 
is the period of time that the Nasdaq 
Market Center will hold the Order for 
potential execution. Participants specify 
an Order’s TIF by designating a time at 
which the Order will become active and 
a time at which the Order will cease to 
be active.
6
Among the times available 
for Order deactivation is one year after 
Order entry.
7
 
An Order that is designated to 
deactivate one year after entry may be 
referred to as a ‘‘Good-till-Cancelled’’ or 
‘‘GTC’’ Order. If a GTC Order is 
designated as eligible for execution 
during Market Hours
8
only, it may be 
referred to as having a Time in Force of 
‘‘Market Hours Good-till-Cancelled’’ or 
‘‘MGTC.’’
9
If a GTC Order is designated 
as eligible for execution during System 
Hours,
10
it may be referred to as having 
a Time in Force of ‘‘System Hours Good- 
till-Cancelled’’ or ‘‘SGTC.’’
11
Therefore, 
both in the Exchange’s rules and in this 
filing, references to the TIF of GTC 
include both the TIF of MGTC and the 
TIF of SGTC. 
The Exchange proposes to 
discontinue the availability of the GTC 
TIF on its equities market. In order to 
do so, the Exchange proposes to modify 
Nasdaq Equity 4, Rule 4703(a) to delete 
‘‘one year after entry’’ from the list of 
available times for deactivating an 
Order. The Exchange also proposes to 
modify Nasdaq Equity 4, Rule 
4703(a)(3), which contains the 
definition of the GTC TIF, by deleting it 
in its entirety and reserving that rule 
number. 
In order to remove references 
elsewhere in its rulebook to the GTC 
TIF, the Exchange proposes to remove a 
reference to GTC Orders in the listing 
standards for Exchange-Traded 
Managed Fund Shares (‘‘NextShares’’). 
Specifically, Nasdaq Rule 5745(b)(6)(B) 
currently specifies that the TIF of GTC 
(and, by implication, MGTC and SGTC) 
is not applicable to Orders for 
NextShares. Given that the Exchange is 
removing the TIF of GTC from its Equity 
Rules, the Exchange proposes to 
eliminate the reference to GTC in this 
listing rule, as that reference would be 
obsolete. Consistent with this change, 
the Exchange also proposes to 
redesignate Rule 5745(b)(6)(A) as Rule 
5745(b)(6), and to rephrase the rule to 
reflect that there is now only one 
exception to the Order Attributes 
applicable to NextShares. 
The Exchange also proposes to make 
the following conforming changes to its 
Equity Rules, to delete all other 
references to GTC Orders: 
€Nasdaq Equity 4, Rule 4702(b)(7)(B) specifies that a Market Maker Peg Order 
may not have a TIF of GTC. The 
Exchange proposes to remove this 
reference to GTC. 
€Nasdaq Equity 4, Rule 4752 concerns the Exchange’s opening 
process: 
ÆRule 4752(a)(10) includes in the definition of Market Hours Orders those 
that have a TIF of MGTC. The Exchange 
proposes to remove this reference to 
MGTC. 
ÆRule 4752(a)(11) includes in the definition of Open Eligible Interest any 
quotation or any order that may be 
entered into the system and designated 
with a TIF of SGTC. The Exchange 
proposes to remove this reference to 
SGTC. 
€Nasdaq Equity 4, Rule 4754 concerns the Nasdaq Closing Cross. Rule 
4754(a)(1) defines Close Eligible Interest 
to mean any quotation or any order that 
may be entered into the system and 
designated with a TIF of SGTC or 
MGTC, among others. The Exchange 
proposes to remove this reference to 
SGTC and MGTC. 
€Nasdaq Equity 4, Rule 4761 concerns procedures in response to 
issuer corporate actions, including any 
dividend (whether payable in cash or 
securities or both), payment, 
distribution, forward or reverse stock 
split, symbol change, or change in 
primary listing venue. Rule 4761(b) 
contains only such procedures that are 
specific to Orders with a TIF of GTC. 
Therefore, the Exchange proposes to 
remove Rule 4761(b) in its entirety. 
Consistent with this change, the 
Exchange proposes to redesignate Rule 
4761(a) as Rule 4761, and to remove the 
introductory ‘‘Except as provided 
below,’’ introductory phrase to that rule. 
€Nasdaq Equity 6, Section 5 sets out the risk settings that the Exchange offers 
to a Participant’s activities on the 
Exchange. Section 5(c) concerns Cancel- 
on-Disconnect Control. This optional 
control allows a Participant, when it 
experiences a disruption in its 
connection to the Exchange, to 
immediately cancel all pending 
Exchange Orders except GTC Orders, 
among others. The Exchange proposes 
to remove this reference to GTC Orders. 
€Nasdaq Equity 9, Section 1 concerns the adjustment of open orders. 
Section 1(d) defines ‘‘open order’’ as an 
order to buy or an open stop order to 
sell, including but not limited to, ‘‘good 
‘til cancelled’’ orders, among others. 
The Exchange proposes to remove this 
reference to ‘‘good ‘til cancelled.’’ 
Starting on the day that the Exchange 
discontinues the GTC TIF Order 
Attribute, any new GTC Orders sent to 
the Exchange will be rejected. Any GTC 
Orders remaining on the Nasdaq Book at 
the close of the trading day immediately 
preceding the discontinuation of the 
GTC TIF Order Attribute will be 
cancelled by the Exchange. The 
discontinuation of the GTC TIF Order 
Attribute will become operative in the 
first quarter of 2026. The Exchange 
currently intends to discontinue GTC 
Orders on February 2, 2026. Therefore, 
any GTC Orders remaining on the 
Nasdaq Book at the close of trading on 
January 30, 2026, would be cancelled by 
the Exchange.
12
If the Exchange were to 
postpone this February 2, 2026, 
discontinuation date to a later date in 
the first quarter of 2026, the new 
discontinuation date would be 
communicated by the Exchange through 
an Equity Trader Alert. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
13
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
14
 
in particular, in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
It is consistent with the Act for the 
Exchange to modify the Order Attributes 
available on equities orders on the 
Exchange. Nasdaq has found that very 
few Participants avail themselves of the 
GTC TIF. Retaining this functionality

17 CFR 240.19b–4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6) requires a self-regulatory organization to give 
the Commission written notice of its intent to file 
the proposed rule change at least five business days 
prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule 
change, or such shorter time as designated by the 
Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this 
requirement.

adds complexity to the Exchange’s 
rulebook that outweighs its utility to 
Participants. Discontinuing this disused 
functionality will promote just and 
equitable principles of trade and remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system by 
streamlining the TIFs offered on the 
Exchange. 
It is also consistent with the Act to 
delete all references GTC Orders found 
in the Exchange’s listing rules and 
Equity Rules. Removing this now- 
obsolete rule text will promote just and 
equitable principles of trade and remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system by 
avoiding any possible confusion as to 
the discontinuation of the GTC TIF 
functionality. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule changes will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. In this 
regard, proposed changes that 
streamline the Order Attributes 
available on the Exchange are pro- 
competitive because they bolster the 
efficiency, functionality, and overall 
attractiveness of the Exchange in an 
absolute sense and relative to its peers. 
Moreover, the proposed changes will 
not unduly burden intra-market 
competition among various Exchange 
participants. Nasdaq has observed that 
very few Participants currently avail 
themselves of the GTC TIF, so that it is 
no longer worthwhile for the Exchange 
to retain this functionality and its 
attendant complexity. The Exchange 
would continue to offer Participants 
many other TIF options to help them 
achieve their trading objectives. 
Furthermore, if there are Participants 
who are dissatisfied with the proposal, 
they are free to shift their order flow to 
competing venues that may offer them 
order handling functionality that better 
suits their trading objectives. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: (i) significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant 
burden on competition; and (iii) become 
operative for 30 days from the date on 
which it was filed, or such shorter time 
as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
15
and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b-4 
thereunder.
16
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act. 
Comments may be submitted by any of 
the following methods:

No. 10–240) (order approving application of MIAX 
Sapphire, LLC for registration as a national 
securities exchange). (Exhibit B) (establishing rules 
for the physical Trading Floor). 
4
The term ‘‘Trading Floor’’ or ‘‘Floor’’ means the 
physical trading floor of the Exchange located in 
Miami, Florida. The Trading Floor shall consist of 
one ‘‘Crowd Area’’ or ‘‘Pit’’ where Floor 
Participants will be located and option contracts 
will be traded. The Crowd Area or Pit shall be 
marked with specific visible boundaries on the 
Trading Floor, as determined by the Exchange. A 
Floor Broker must represent all orders in an ‘‘open 
outcry’’ fashion in the Crowd Area. See Exchange Rule 100.

Physical trading began on the MIAX Sapphire 
Trading Floor on September 12, 2025. See MIAX Press Release, Miami International Holdings

of securities. See Exchange Rule 100. 8
A Floor Broker is an individual who is 
registered with the Exchange for the purpose, while 
on the Trading Floor, of accepting and handling 
options orders. A floor Broker must be registered as 
a Floor Participant prior to registering as a Floor 
Broker. A Floor Broker may take into his own 
account, and subsequently liquidate, any position 
that results from an error made while attempting to 
execute, as Floor Broker, an order. See Exchange Rule 2015.

The term ‘‘Member’’ means an individual or 
organization approved to exercise the trading rights 
associated with a Trading Permit. Members are

any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
On July 15, 2024, the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission (the 
‘‘Commission’’) approved the 
Exchange’s Form 1 application to 
register as a national securities exchange 
under Section 6 of the Exchange Act.
3
 
At that time, the Exchange adopted its 
Rulebook which established rules for 
both the electronic market and the 
physical Trading Floor,
4
even though 
the physical Trading Floor
5
was slated 
to launch several months following the 
launch of the electronic market.
6
 
Included in the Rulebook was Rule 516, 
Order Types, which established a 
‘‘Route to Floor Order’’ order type, 
among other order types. At the time the 
Exchange adopted Rule 516 (July 15, 
2024), the Exchange believed that such 
an order type might be desired by 
Members once the Trading Floor 
actually launched. However, to date, 
there has been no such Member interest 
to implement and support such order 
type. Accordingly, since this order type 
was never built in the Exchange’s 
System
7
or implemented on the 
Exchange, and since the Exchange does 
not propose to build and implement this 
order type in the future, the Exchange 
proposes to remove this order type from 
the Exchange’s Rulebook. To the extent 
that the Exchange changes its opinion 
and desires to implement such an order 
type in the future, the Exchange will file 
a separate rule change with the 
Commission under Rule 19b–4. 
Proposal To Remove the Definition of 
Route to Floor Order 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Exchange Rule 516 to remove the 
definition of Route to Floor Order. 
Currently, Exchange Rule 516(k) 
provides that, ‘‘[a] Route to Floor order 
is an order that is routed to a designated 
Floor Broker
8
on the Exchange’s 
Trading Floor. An order routed to the 
Trading Floor is handled in accordance 
with Rule 2040.’’ The Exchange notes 
that Route to Floor orders have never 
been implemented and are not currently 
in use. Additionally, the Exchange has 
no plans to implement this order type 
and now proposes to remove paragraph 
(k) of Rule 516 in its entirety. The 
purpose of the proposed change is to 
remove an unused order type from the 
Exchange’s Rulebook to provide greater 
clarity to Members
9
and the public 
regarding the Exchange’s offerings and 
functionality. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
Section 6(b) of the Act,
10
in general, and 
furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
11
in particular, in that it is 
designed to prevent fraudulent and 
manipulative acts and practices, to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to foster cooperation and 
coordination with persons engaged in 
regulating, clearing, settling, processing 
information with respect to, and 
facilitating transactions in securities, to 
remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest. Specifically, the 
Exchange believes that the proposed 
rule change will provide greater clarity 
to Members and the public regarding the 
Exchange’s Rulebook by removing the 
description of an order type that was not 
implemented for use on the Exchange, 
thereby providing accuracy and 
consistency within the Exchange’s 
Rulebook. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change also furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.
12
 
In particular, that it is designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative 
acts and practices, promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, foster 
cooperation and coordination with 
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, 
settling, processing information with 
respect to, and facilitating transactions 
in securities, remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanisms of a free 
and open market and a national market 
system and, in general, protect investors 
and the public interest. The Exchange 
believes the proposed change promotes 
just and equitable principles of trade 
and remove impediments to and perfect 
the mechanism of a free and open 
market and a national market system 
because the proposed rule change will 
provide greater clarity to Members and 
the public regarding the Exchange’s 
Rulebook by removing the description 
of an order type which was not 
implemented for use on the Exchange, 
thereby removing any inconsistency 
between the Exchange’s Rulebook and 
its System. It is in the public interest for 
the Exchange’s Rulebook to be accurate 
and concise so as to eliminate the 
potential for confusion. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
Intramarket Competition 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change does not impose 
any burden on intramarket competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act 
as the order type was never 
implemented for use on the Exchange, 
therefore removal of the description of 
the order type from the Rulebook is 
benign. The proposed rule change is not

the Commission written notice of its intent to file 
the proposed rule change, along with a brief 
description and text of the proposed rule change, 
at least five business days prior to the date of filing 
of the proposed rule change, or such shorter time

efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See

intended to address any competitive 
issue but rather is concerned solely with 
ensuring the Exchange’s Rulebook 
accurately reflects functionality 
currently in place on the Exchange. 
Intermarket Competition 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change does not impose any burden 
on intermarket competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
proposed rule change is not intended to 
address any competitive issue but rather 
is concerned solely with updating the 
Exchange’s Rulebook to provide 
accuracy and consistency regarding 
functionality offered by the Exchange 
and eliminate the potential for 
confusion. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
Written comments were neither 
solicited nor received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The Exchange has filed the proposed 
rule change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act
13
and Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6)
14
thereunder. Because the 
proposed rule change does not: (i) 
significantly affect the protection of 
investors or the public interest; (ii) 
impose any significant burden on 
competition; and (iii) become operative 
prior to 30 days from the date on which 
it was filed, or such shorter time as the 
Commission may designate, if 
consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest, the 
proposed rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) 
of the Act
15
and Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
16
 
thereunder. 
A proposed rule change filed under 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
17
normally does not 
become operative prior to 30 days after 
the date of the filing. However, pursuant 
to Rule 19b4(f)(6)(iii),
18
the Commission 
may designate a shorter time if such 
action is consistent with the protection 
of investors and the public interest. The 
Exchange has asked the Commission to 
waive the 30-day operative delay so that 
the proposal may become operative 
immediately upon filing. The 
Commission believes that waiving the 
30-day operative delay is consistent 
with the protection of investors and the 
public interest, because it will allow the 
Exchange to immediately remove the 
description of an order type that was 
never implemented for use on the 
Exchange from the Exchange’s 
Rulebook, which will provide greater 
accuracy, clarity and consistency to 
Members and the public regarding the 
Exchange’s Rulebook. Accordingly, the 
Commission designates the proposed 
rule change to be operative upon 
filing.
19
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of this proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may

4 (Exchange Sharing of Participant Risk Settings) to 
Permit the Allocation of Responsibility to Clearing 
Members) (‘‘Nasdaq Filing’’). 
10
As adopted in the Nasdaq Filing, this Nasdaq 
rule reads as follows: ‘‘Clearing Member 
Designation. A Participant that does not self-clear 
may allocate the responsibility for establishing and 
adjusting the risk levels identified in Equity 6, 
Section 5 to a clearing member that clears 
transactions on behalf of the Participant, if 
designated in a manner prescribed by the Exchange. 
A Participant that chooses to allocate responsibility 
to its clearing member may view any risk levels 
established by the clearing member pursuant to this 
Rule, and will be notified of any action taken by 
the Exchange with respect to its trading activity. A 
Participant may revoke responsibility allocated to 
its clearing member pursuant to this paragraph at 
any time, if designated in a manner prescribed by 
the Exchange.’’ 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
PHLX Equity 6, Section 4 to permit the 
allocation of responsibility to clearing 
members. Specifically, the Exchange 
proposes to add a new Section 4(b) 
(Clearing Member Designation) to allow 
a PSX Participant that does not self- 
clear to allocate responsibility for 
establishing and adjusting its risk levels 
to a clearing member that clears 
transactions on behalf of the PSX 
Participant.
3
A clearing member 
guarantees transactions executed on the 
Exchange for PSX Participants with 
whom it has entered into a clearing 
arrangement, and therefore bears the 
risk associated with those transactions. 
Because a clearing member bears the 
risk on behalf of its associated PSX 
Participant, the Exchange believes that 
it is appropriate for the clearing member 
to have knowledge of what risk settings 
the PSX Participant may utilize within 
the Exchange’s trading system, as well 
as the option to set and adjust the risk 
levels. Therefore, the Exchange 
proposes to make a PSX Participant’s 
risk settings in PHLX Equity 6, Section 
5 available to a clearing member, as well 
as the option to set and adjust the risk 
levels, if authorized by a PSX 
Participant. 
For clarification, the Exchange does 
not guarantee that these risk controls 
will be sufficiently comprehensive to 
meet all of a PSX Participant’s needs, 
nor are the controls designed to be the 
sole means of risk management, and 
using these controls will not necessarily 
meet a PSX Participant’s obligations 
required by Exchange or federal rules— 
including, without limitation, Rule 
15c3–5 under the Act
4
(‘‘Rule 15c3–5’’). 
Use of the Exchange’s risk settings in 
PHLX Equity 6, Section 5 will not 
automatically constitute compliance 
with Exchange or federal rules, and the 
responsibility for compliance with all 
Exchange and federal rules remains 
with the PSX Participant.
5
 
If a PSX Participant chooses to 
designate responsibility to a clearing 
member, the PSX Participant may view 
any risk levels established by the 
clearing member pursuant to proposed 
PHLX Equity 6, Section 4(b). Even if a 
clearing member is designated, a PSX 
Participant will continue to be notified 
by the Exchange of any action taken 
regarding its trading activity. A PSX 
Participant may revoke the 
responsibility it has allocated to a 
clearing member at any time. 
The Exchange also proposes labeling 
current rule PHLX Equity 6, Section 4(a) 
as PHLX Equity 6, Section 4(a) (Sharing 
Risk Settings). Additionally, the 
Exchange proposes to make a technical 
correction to PHLX Equity 6, Section 
4(a). That rule currently refers to ‘‘the 
commentary below,’’ but the rule has no 
associated commentary. What happened 
is that in 2021, as part of a major 
rulebook reorganization effort, the 
Exchange redesignated PSX Rule 3215 
as PHLX Equity 6, Section 4 and Section 
5.
6
The text of PSX Rule 3215, minus its 
commentary, was redesignated as PHLX 
Equity 6, Section 4. Meanwhile, the 
commentary to PSX Rule 3215 was 
redesignated as PHLX Equity 6, Section 
5. Therefore, the Exchange proposes 
substituting the reference to ‘‘the 
commentary below’’ in PHLX Equity 6, 
Section 4(a) with a reference to PHLX 
Equity 6, Section 5. The substance of the 
newly labeled and corrected PHLX 
Equity 6, Section 4(a) remains 
unchanged. 
The Exchange will announce the 
implementation date of the change 
described in this filing in an Equity 
Trader Alert at least 30 days prior to 
implementation. At present, the 
Exchange expects that the functionality 
described in this filing will be ready for 
implementation in the first quarter of 
2026, although that time frame is subject 
to change. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
7
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
8
 
in particular, in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
As a preliminary matter, the Exchange 
notes that this proposal is not novel. 
Earlier this year The Nasdaq Stock 
Market LLC made a parallel change to 
its rulebook.
9
The language of Nasdaq 
Equity 6, Section 4(b) is substantively 
identical to the new rule text proposed 
by the Exchange in the present filing.
10
 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed amendment to PHLX Equity 6, 
Section 4 would provide clearing 
members, who have assumed certain 
risks of PSX Participants, greater control 
over risk tolerance and exposure on 
behalf of their correspondent PSX 
Participant, while helping to ensure that 
both the PSX Participant and its clearing 
member are aware of developing issues. 
A clearing member guarantees 
transactions executed on Nasdaq for 
members with whom it has entered into 
a clearing arrangement, and therefore 
bears the risk associated with those 
transactions. The Exchange therefore 
believes that it is appropriate for a 
clearing member to have knowledge of 
what risk settings a PSX Participant may 
utilize within the Exchange’s trading 
system, as well as the option to set and

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60164 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Notices 11
All Exchange orders pass through basic risk 
checks regardless of whether a PSX Participant opts 
into a risk setting. 
12
15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii). 
13
17 CFR 240.19b–4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6) requires a self-regulatory organization to give 
the Commission written notice of its intent to file 
the proposed rule change at least five business days 
prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule 
change, or such shorter time as designated by the 
Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this 
requirement. 
14
17 CFR 200.30–3(a)(12). 
adjust the risk levels. The proposal will 
permit a clearing member with whom a 
PSX Participant has entered into a 
clearing arrangement to better monitor 
and manage the potential risks assumed 
by the clearing member, thereby 
providing the clearing member with 
greater control and flexibility over 
setting its own risk tolerance and 
exposure and aiding the clearing 
member in complying with the 
requirements of the Act. 
The Exchange also believes that the 
proposed amendment will assist PSX 
Participants and clearing members in 
managing their financial exposure 
which, in turn, could enhance the 
integrity of trading on the securities 
markets and help to ensure the stability 
of the financial system. Moreover, a PSX 
Participant may revoke responsibility 
allocated to its clearing member at any 
time. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change does not unfairly 
discriminate among PSX Participants 
because the use of the risk settings 
under PHLX Equity 6, Section 5 would 
be available to all PSX Participants and 
their clearing members, if authorized. In 
addition, because all orders on the 
Exchange pass through the Exchange’s 
risk checks, there would be no 
difference in the latency experienced by 
PSX Participants who have opted to use 
the risk settings versus those who have 
not opted to use them.
11
 
Additionally, the Exchange believes 
that relabeling PHLX Equity 6, Section 
4(a) as PHLX Equity 6, Section 4(a) 
(Sharing Risk Settings), and correcting 
the reference to the ‘‘commentary’’ in 
that rule to its current location in PHLX 
Equity 6, Section 5, are consistent with 
the Act because they make PHLX Equity 
6, Section 4 easier to understand and 
navigate, which should aid all PSX 
Participants in following the rules of the 
Exchange. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
proposed rule change is designed to 
provide PSX Participants and their 
clearing members with additional 
means to monitor and control risk. The 
proposed rule may increase confidence 
in the proper functioning of the markets 
and contribute to additional 
competition among trading venues and 
broker-dealers. Rather than impede 
competition, the proposal is designed to 
facilitate more robust risk management 
by PSX Participants and clearing 
members, which, in turn, could enhance 
the integrity of trading on the securities 
markets and help to ensure the stability 
of the financial system. Additionally, 
the changes to PHLX Equity 6, Section 
4(a) will not have any impact on 
competition, as they are merely 
technical in nature. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: (i) significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant 
burden on competition; and (iii) become 
operative for 30 days from the date on 
which it was filed, or such shorter time 
as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
12
and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b–4 
thereunder.
13
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

the following methods:

and Form 1–N, summarized below. The 
Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the 
Office of Management and Budget for 
extension and approval. The Code of 
Federal Regulation citation to this 
collection of information is 17 CFR 
240.6a–4 and 17 CFR 249.10 under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
U.S.C. 78a et seq.) (the ‘‘Act’’). 
Section 6 of the Act
1
sets out a 
framework for the registration and 
regulation of national securities 
exchanges. Under the Commodity 
Futures Modernization Act of 2000, a 
futures market may trade security 
futures products by registering as a 
national securities exchange. Rule 6a– 
4
2
sets forth these registration 
procedures and directs futures markets 
to submit a notice registration on Form 
1–N.
3
Form 1–N calls for information 
regarding how the futures market 
operates, its rules and procedures, 
corporate governance, its criteria for 
membership, its subsidiaries and 
affiliates, and the security futures 
products it intends to trade. Rule 6a–4 
also requires entities that have 
submitted an initial Form 1–N to file: (1) 
amendments to Form 1–N in the event 
of material changes to the information 
provided in the initial Form 1–N; (2) 
periodic updates of certain information 
provided in the initial Form 1–N; (3) 
certain information that is provided to 
the futures market’s members; and (4) a 
monthly report summarizing the futures 
market’s trading of security futures 
products. The information required to 
be filed with the Commission pursuant 
to Rule 6a–4 is designed to enable the 
Commission to carry out its statutorily 
mandated oversight functions and to 
ensure that registered and exempt 
exchanges continue to be in compliance 
with the Act. 
The respondents to the collection of 
information are futures markets. 
The Commission estimates that the 
total annual burden for all respondents 
to provide periodic amendments to keep 
the Form 1–N accurate and up to date 
as required under Rule 6a–4(b)(1) would 
be 45 hours (15 hours/respondent per 
year × 3 respondents) and $327 of miscellaneous clerical expenses. The 
Commission estimates that the total 
annual burden for all respondents to 
provide annual amendments under Rule 
6a–4(b)(3) would be 45 hours (15 hours/ 
respondent/year × 3 respondents) and $327 of miscellaneous clerical expenses. 
The Commission estimates that the total 
annual burden for all respondents to 
provide three-year amendments under 
Rule 6a–4(b)(4) would be 20 hours (20 
hours/respondent × 1 respondents per year) and $145 in miscellaneous clerical 
expenses. The Commission estimates 
that the total annual burden for the 
filing of the supplemental information 
and the monthly reports required under 
Rule 6a–4(c) would be 18 hours (6 
hours/respondent per year × 3 respondents) and $196.20 of 
miscellaneous clerical expenses. Thus, 
the Commission estimates the total 
annual burden for complying with Rule 
6a–4 is 128 hours and $995.20 in 
miscellaneous clerical expenses. 
Compliance with Rule 6a–4 is 
mandatory. Information received in 
response to Rule 6a–4 shall not be kept 
confidential; the information collected 
is public information. 
An agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
Control Number. 
Written comments are invited on: (a) 
whether this proposed collection of 
information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the SEC, 
including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of 
the SEC’s estimate of the burden 
imposed by the proposed collection of 
information, including the validity of 
the methodology and the assumptions 
used; (c) ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize 
the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including 
through the use of automated, electronic 
collection techniques or other forms of 
information technology.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 25, 2025, Executive Order 14249 was 
issued to modernize federal financial 
oversight, strengthen controls over U.S. 
General Fund transactions, and combat 
fraud, waste, and abuse. It consolidates 
payment systems, mandates electronic 
transactions, and enhances 
accountability in government financial 
operations. The E.O. requires federal 
agencies to overhaul their financial 
practices by modernizing payment 
systems, instituting robust pre- 
certification for all payment 
transactions, and increasing data 
sharing with the Department of Treasury 
(‘‘Treasury’’) to prevent fraud and 
improper payments. In support of this 
effort, OMB Memorandum M–25–32 
requires agencies to review and update 
their System of Records Notices 
(SORNs) under the Privacy Act, as 
relevant and necessary, to include a new 
routine use clause that allows for the 
sharing of records with the Treasury to 
review payment and award eligibility 
through the Do Not Pay Working 
System. To ensure compliance with the 
review and update requirements 
outlined in Executive Order 14249 and 
OMB Memorandum M–25–32, the 
Commission conducted a 
comprehensive review of its SORN 
inventory to identify and implement 
necessary modifications. The proposed 
modification to add a new routine use 
to the identified SORN, SEC–06, aligns 
with the Privacy Act and incorporates 
the new requirements introduced by 
OMB Memorandum M–25–32. 
Accordingly, the Commission is 
proposing to modify SEC–06 to add new 
routine use number 14 as follows: 
‘‘To the U.S. Department of the 
Treasury when disclosure of the 
information is relevant to review 
payment and award eligibility through 
the Do Not Pay Working System for the 
purposes of identifying, preventing, or 
recouping improper payments to an 
applicant for, or recipient of, Federal 
funds, including funds disbursed by a 
state (meaning a state of the United 
States, the District of Columbia, a 
territory or possession of the United 
States, or a federally recognized Indian 
tribe) in a state-administered, federally 
funded program.’’ 
The remaining routine uses were 
previously published. 
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), 
we have provided a report to OMB and 
Congress on the proposal to modify the 
system of records.

A ‘‘Designated Liquidity Provider’’ or ‘‘DLP’’ is 
a registered Nasdaq market maker for a Qualified 
Security that has committed to maintain minimum 
performance standards. A DLP shall be selected by 
Nasdaq based on factors including, but not limited 
to, experience with making markets in exchange- 
traded products, adequacy of capital, willingness to 
promote Nasdaq as a marketplace, issuer 
preference, operational capacity, support personnel, 
and history of adherence to Nasdaq rules and 
securities laws. Nasdaq may limit the number of 
DLPs in a security, or modify a previously 
established limit, upon prior written notice to 
members. See Equity 7, Section 114(f)(2). 4
As set out in proposed paragraph (g)(2) of Equity 
7, Section 114, a ‘‘Market Quality Supporter’’ or 
‘‘MQS’’ has committed to maintain minimum 
performance standards in Low Volume ETPs. An 
MQS shall be selected by Nasdaq based on factors 
including, but not limited to, experience with 
making markets in exchange-traded products, 
adequacy of capital, willingness to promote Nasdaq 
as a marketplace, issuer preference, operational 
capacity, support personnel, and history of 
adherence to Nasdaq rules and securities laws. 
5
Under this program, a security may be 
designated as a ‘‘Qualified Security’’ if it (1) is an 
ETP listed on Nasdaq pursuant to Rules 5704, 5705, 
5710, 5711, 5713, 5715, 5720, 5735, 5745, 5750 or 
5760, and (2) has at least one DLP. See Equity 7, Section 114(f)(1). 
6
These MQMs are measured on average in the 
DLP’s assigned ETP during regular market hours, 
except for auction quality requirements that are 
measured each auction against the metrics. See 
Equity 7, Section 114(f)(4). 
7
Average spread is the time weighted average 
spread in basis points when the DLP has a two- 
sided quote. 
8
Auction quality is measured by auction price 
deviation from first reference price after 30 seconds 
before the market open (Opening) and 120 before 
the market close (Closing). 
EXEMPTIONS PROMULGATED FOR THE SYSTEM: 
None.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; The

Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of 
Proposed Rule Change To Enhance 
the Designated Liquidity Provider 
Program and Add a New Market 
Quality Supporter Program 
December 18, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
11, 2025, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 
(‘‘Nasdaq’’ or ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘SEC’’ or ‘‘Commission’’) the proposed 
rule change as described in Items I, II, 
and III, below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to (i) enhance 
the Designated Liquidity Provider (as 
defined below) program in Equity 7, 
Section 114(f), and (ii) add a new 
Market Quality Supporter (as defined 
below) program in Equity 7, Section 
114(g). 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/nasdaq/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The purpose of the proposed rule 
change is to (i) enhance the Designated 
Liquidity Provider
3
(‘‘DLP’’) program in 
Equity 7, Section 114(f), and (ii) add a 
new Market Quality Supporter
4
 
(‘‘MQS’’) program in Equity 7, Section 
114(g). 
Together, these proposed changes are 
intended to create a more scalable, 
targeted, and effective market quality 
support structure for Nasdaq-listed 
exchange-traded products (‘‘ETPs’’). 
The Exchange initially filed the 
proposed pricing changes on December 
1, 2025 (SR–NASDAQ–2025–097). On 
December 11, 2025, the Exchange 
withdrew that filing and submitted this 
filing. 
Background 
Pursuant to Equity 7, Section 114(f), 
the Exchange currently maintains a DLP 
program that is designed to enhance 
liquidity and market quality in Nasdaq- 
listed ETPs by providing incentives to 
the DLP for a Qualified Security.
5
The 
DLP program provides tiered rebates to 
qualifying DLPs based on a combination 
of performance criteria (i.e., market quality metrics or ‘‘MQM’’) and trading 
activity based on average daily volume 
(‘‘ADV’’) in the DLP’s assigned ETP. The 
MQMs are set out in paragraph (f)(4) of 
Equity 7, Section 114, and measure:
6
(1) 
percentage of time at the national best 
bid (best offer) (‘‘NBBO’’), (2) percentage 
of time within 5 basis points of NBBO, 
(3) average notional depth within 
specified basis points of the NBBO, (4) 
average spread,
7
and (5) auction 
quality.
8
Primary DLPs may qualify for 
either a standard DLP rebate by meeting 
at least 4 of 5 standard MQMs in the 
assigned ETP or an enhanced DLP 
rebate by meeting all 5 enhanced 
MQMs, as specified in Equity 7, Section 
114(f)(4). As set out in Section 114(f)(5), 
a Primary DLP that satisfies the MQMs 
in Section 114(f)(4) will be eligible to 
receive the rebates provided in 
paragraph (A) of Section 114(f)(5) in 
each of its assigned ETPs for which it 
qualified. For ETPs with higher ADV 
(i.e., Tiers 1 and 2), eligible Primary DLPs receive the standard or enhanced 
rebate for which they qualified for each 
displayed share that adds liquidity in 
the ETP. For lower ADV ETPs (i.e., Tiers 3–5), the Primary DLP receives fixed 
monthly payments for their standard or 
enhanced rebates, as applicable, which 
are in addition to any other rebate the 
Primary DLP is eligible for under Equity 
7, Sections 114 and 118. Specifically, 
Nasdaq currently pays qualifying 
Primary DLPs in accordance with the 
following rebate schedule in Section 
114(f)(5)(A): 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:11 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00113 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\23DEN1.SGM 23DEN1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60169 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Notices 9
The Secondary DLP is determined by using the 
same factors for DLPs in Section 114(f)(2), 
including, but not limited to, experience with 
making markets in exchange-traded products, 
adequacy of capital, willingness to promote Nasdaq 
as a marketplace, issuer preference, operational 
capacity, support personnel, and history of 
adherence to Nasdaq rules and securities laws. 
10
As discussed below, ‘‘Low Volume’’ will mean 
ETPs with a monthly ADV of 1 million shares or 
less in the prior month. This ADV volume threshold 
equates to the ADV volume threshold for Tiers 2– 
5 under the current DLP rebate program in Equity 
7, Section 114(f)(5)(A). The Exchange is not 
proposing to amend the DLP program’s ADV 
volume thresholds under this proposal. 
11
The term ‘‘rebates’’ would therefore refer to the 
incentives that are provided per executed share. 
Tiers ADV Standard rebate Enhanced rebate Tier 1 ................ ETP with monthly ADV greater than 1 million in the 
prior month.
$0.0034 per executed share ...... $0.0036 per executed share. 
Tier 2 ................ ETP with monthly ADV between 250,001 and 1 million 
in the prior month.
$0.0040 per executed share ...... $0.0042 per executed share. 
Tier 3 ................ ETP with monthly ADV between 150,001 and 250,000 
in the prior month.
$200 per month .......................... $350 per month. 
Tier 4 ................ ETP with monthly ADV between 50,001 and 150,000 in 
the prior month.
$225 per month .......................... $450 per month. 
Tier 5 ................ ETP with monthly ADV less than 50,001 in the prior 
month.
$300 per month .......................... $500 per month. 
Further, if two DLPs are assigned to 
a Nasdaq-listed ETP, one may be 
designated as the Secondary DLP, which 
may receive rebates if it meets 2 of the 
enhanced MQMs in Section 114(f)(4) 
(excluding the auction quality MQM).
9
 
Section 114(f)(5)(A) sets forth the rebate 
schedule for Secondary DLPs. For ETPs 
with higher ADV (i.e., Tiers 1 and 2), eligible Secondary DLPs receive an 
additional $0.0003 per executed share 
that is in addition to any other rebate 
the Secondary DLP is eligible for under 
Equity 7, Sections 114 and 118. For 
ETPs with lower ADV (i.e., Tiers 3–5), eligible Secondary DLPs receive an 
additional $150 per month that is in 
addition to any other rebate the 
Secondary DLP is eligible for under 
Equity 7, Sections 114 and 118. 
Lastly, the DLP program also has an 
additional Tape C ETP incentive for 
Primary DLPs based on their quoting 
performance across their ETP 
assignments. As set forth in Section 
114(f)(4), the Exchange currently 
requires that the average time the 
Primary DLP is at the NBBO for each 
assigned ETP averages at least 20%, and 
the average liquidity provided by the 
Primary DLP for each assigned ETP 
averages at least 5% of the liquidity 
provided on Nasdaq in the respective 
ETP. Qualifying Primary DLPs are then 
provided incremental rebates for each 
displayed share that adds liquidity in a 
Tape C ETP in accordance with the 
following schedule in Section 
114(f)(5)(B): 
Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 3 Tier 4 Minimum Monthly Average Number of As-
signed ETPs as a Primary DLP.
10 ............................... 25 ............................... 50 ............................... 100. 
Incremental Tape C ETP Rebate .................. $0.0002 per executed 
share.

Proposal 1: DLP Program 
As discussed in detail below, the 
Exchange proposes to enhance the 
current DLP program in Equity 7, 
Section 114(f) by: (1) eliminating the 
distinction between Primary and 
Secondary DLPs, eliminating Secondary 
DLP rebates, and limiting the number of 
DLPs to one DLP per Qualified Security; 
(2) replacing the distinction between 
standard and enhanced MQMs (and 
associated rebates) with a single set of 
MQMs (and associated rebates); (3) 
adding a new ‘‘Low Volume’’
10
group 
framework; (4) replacing some of the 
current MQMs with more detailed 
MQMs; (5) increasing the fixed monthly 
DLP rebates for Tiers 3–5; (6) updating 
the qualifications, eligibility thresholds, 
and associated rebates for the additional 
Tape C ETP incentive; and (7) making 
non-substantive changes throughout 
proposed Section 114(f) to remove all 
references to ‘‘fees’’ as the Exchange 
would only provide incentives under 
the DLP Program and to add references 
to ‘‘stipends’’ to refer to the monthly 
fixed payments the Exchange would 
provide to eligible DLPs.
11
With the 
proposed amendments, the Exchange is 
seeking to enhance market quality and 
encourage broader DLP participation, 
including in investment strategies that 
exhibit wider spreads and lower trading 
volume. 
As described above, the DLP program 
currently provides separate rebates for 
eligible Primary and Secondary DLPs. 
Primary DLPs are also eligible for 
standard or enhanced rebates based on 
whether they meet the relevant standard 
or enhanced MQMs. The Exchange now 
proposes to remove the distinction 
between Primary and Secondary DLPs, 
and eliminate the Secondary DLP 
rebates (and associated qualifications) 
under Equity 7, Section 114(f)(4) and 
(5). The Exchange also proposes to 
eliminate the standard and enhanced 
rebates (and associated qualifications) 
under Equity 7, Section 114(f)(4) and 
(5). Under this proposal, and as further 
described below, any DLP may qualify 
for one set of tiered rebates if it meets 
specified MQMs applicable to their 
assigned ETP. 
The Exchange also proposes in 
Section 114(f) to limit the number of 
DLPs in a Qualified Security so that as 
proposed, there may only be one DLP 
per Qualified Security. This is to better 
align the rule text to current practice 
where issuers only have one DLP per 
Qualified Security. Accordingly, the 
Exchange will make corresponding 
changes in paragraphs (f)(1)(B) and (f)(2) 
to make clear that only one DLP will be 
assigned per Qualified Security. 
Specifically in the definition of 
Qualified Security in paragraph (f)(1)(B), 
the Exchange proposes to remove the 
reference to ‘‘at least’’ one DLP so that 
it will be clear the Qualified Security 
has only one DLP. Also in paragraph 
(f)(2), the Exchange proposes to remove 
the last sentence, which currently 
provides that Nasdaq may limit the 
number of DLPs in a security, or modify 
a previously established limit, upon 
prior written notice to members. This 
language will no longer be relevant once

Investment Strategy Group A will currently 
consist of the following investment strategies: 
government fixed income, North American or USD 
denominated developed market fixed income, 
developed market equities, and currencies. 
13
Investment Strategy Group B will currently 
consist of the following investment strategies: 
micro- to small-cap developed market equities, 
multi asset strategies other than absolute returns, 
commodities tracking, international fixed income, 
and derivatives. 
14
Investment Strategy Group C will currently 
consist of the following investment strategies: 
emerging market equities, emerging market fixed 
income, multi asset absolute return strategies, 
commodities strategies and exchange-traded notes 
(‘‘ETNs’’). 
15
The list of investment strategies in Investment 
Strategy Groups A–C will be publicly available on 
Nasdaq’s website and updated to ensure the 
investment strategy’s average NBBO spread remains 
within its respective Investment Strategy Group. 
16
As currently set forth in Equity 7, Section 
114(f)(5)(A), Tier 1 ETPs have a monthly ADV 
greater than 1 million in the prior month. 
the Exchange limits the number of DLPs 
in a Qualified Security to just one. 
The Exchange also proposes to make 
clear how the DLP program will interact 
with the MQS program by providing in 
paragraph (f) that a DLP that is 
designated as a MQS of a Qualified 
Security may also be eligible to receive 
the MQS stipend in proposed Section 
114(g), provided that the DLP meets the 
Market Quality Metrics in the DLP 
program as specified in Section 
114(f)(4)(B) as well as the Market 
Quality Metrics for the MQS program as 
specified in proposed Section 114(g). 
In proposed Section 114(f)(4)(A), the 
Exchange proposes to add a new Low 
Volume group framework. As used in 
the DLP program, the term ‘‘High 
Volume’’ ETPs will mean ETPs with a 
monthly ADV of more than 1 million 
shares in the prior month (i.e., Tier 1). The term ‘‘Low Volume’’ ETPs will 
mean ETPs with a monthly ADV of 1 
million shares or less in the prior 
month, which equates to the ADV 
volume threshold for Tiers 2–5 under 
the current DLP rebate program in 
Section 114(f)(5)(A). The Exchange will 
further segment Low Volume ETPs into 
Investment Strategy Groups A–C, which 
will be different ETP investment 
strategies segmented by their average 
NBBO spread in basis points, over the 
prior two calendar years. The Exchange 
would look at the NBBO continuously 
throughout the regular trading hours of 
the day and take the average of the 
NBBO across all of those times. That 
average would be the NBBO for the day, 
which is then taken and averaged across 
two calendar years to determine the 
Investment Strategy group. 
These Investment Strategy Groups 
will be checked by the Exchange each 
calendar year to ensure the investment 
strategy’s average NBBO spread remains 
within its respective Investment 
Strategy Group. 
Investment strategy group Average NBBO spread in basis points A

B
13
............................................................................................................ 16–28. 
C
14
........................................................................................................... 29 or more. 
Group A includes ETP investment 
strategies that have relatively low 
trading volumes but exhibit relatively 
tighter NBBO spreads compared to 
Groups B and C, which include 
relatively low trading volume 
investment strategies with increasingly 
wider NBBO spreads. Each Nasdaq- 
listed ETP will be assigned an 
Investment Strategy Group, which will 
be publicly available and updated to 
reflect any changes to the assigned 
group.
15
 
As discussed in detail below, the 
Investment Strategy Groups will be used 
to tailor the MQMs that DLPs will need 
to meet in their assigned ETPs to qualify 
for DLP rebates. The proposed 
Investment Strategy Group framework is 
intended to more precisely calibrate the 
DLP incentives to the liquidity profile of 
the investment strategy that the DLP’s 
assigned ETP falls under. The proposed 
framework is also intended to 
incentivize market makers to become 
DLPs in ETPs, particularly ETPs that 
have lower trading volume and are less 
liquid. 
Proposed Section 114(f)(4)(B) will set 
forth the MQM thresholds that the DLP 
must meet based on which Investment 
Strategy Group or High Volume (i.e., 
Tier 1) ETP
16
they are assigned, as 
follows: 
Market quality metrics High volume

Auction Spread in basis points with $75,000 notional depth (Clos-
ing) ............................................................................................... 25 35 60 100 
The proposed MQMs are similar to 
the current MQMs except the Exchange 
is proposing to refine some of the 
existing MQMs (e.g., adding that time at the NBBO must be with a minimum 
notional size of $5,000). The Exchange 
also proposes to delete the existing 
MQM that requires the DLP to be a 
certain percentage of time within 5 basis 
points of the NBBO, and add the new 
auction spread MQMs described above. 
To be eligible for the proposed DLP 
rebates and stipends in paragraph (5)(A) 
of Section 114(f), DLPs will need to

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60171 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Notices 17
Specifically, the MQMs are Auction Spread in 
basis points with $37,500 notional depth (Opening) 
and Auction Spread in basis points with $75,000 
notional depth (Closing). 
18
Paragraph (1)(A) of Section 114(f) provides the 
list of Nasdaq-listed ETPs that are included in the 
DLP program as Qualified Securities, provided it 
has at least one DLP. Specifically, these are ETPs 
listed pursuant to Rules 5704, 5705, 5710, 5711, 
5713, 5715, 5720, 5735, 5745, 5750, or 5760. 
meet 5 of the 7 MQMs described above, 
including auction spread (both opening 
and closing),
17
in the assigned ETP as 
measured by Nasdaq. The Exchange is 
requiring DLPs meet the two auction 
spread metrics because the opening and 
the closing auctions are important parts 
of the day as these auctions set the 
benchmark prices. The Exchange also 
wants to ensure that there is ample 
liquidity during this vital part of the 
trading day. 
Proposed Section 114(f)(4)(B) will 
also provide that for leveraged and 
inverse ETPs, the average spread, 
auction spread, and auction reference 
price difference metrics will be 
multiplied by the absolute value of the 
leverage factor of the ETP. Because 
leveraged and inverse ETPs often 
exhibit higher price volatility relative to 
standard, non-leveraged and non- 
inverse ETPs, the DLP is often taking on 
higher risk and costs to take on these 
products. Adjusting these MQMs by the 
absolute value of the ETP’s leverage 
factor aligns the rebate structure with 
the DLP’s cost of taking these products 
on. These MQMs will be measured on 
average in the assigned ETP during 
regular market hours, except for the 
auction price difference and auction 
spread metrics that are measured at and 
directly before each auction, 
respectively, against the metrics and 
averaged for the monthly period. 
Proposed Section 114(f)(4)(C) will 
provide the new qualifications for the 
additional Tape C ETP incentives for 
DLPs. Specifically, to be eligible for the 
rebates in proposed paragraph (5)(B) of 
Section 114(f), a DLP must meet the 
same average notional depth and 
average spread metrics as described 
above for proposed paragraph (4)(B) of 
Section 114(f). Specifically those 
metrics are as follows: 
Market quality metrics High volume 
ETPs 
Investment

strategy Group C

additional Tape C incentive MQMs in 
order to be eligible for the additional 
Tape C incentives in paragraph (5)(B) of 
Section 114(f). 
Proposed section 114(f)(5) will 
provide that a DLP that satisfies the 
MQMs above will be eligible to receive 
the rebates and stipends provided in 
paragraph (A) below in each of its 
assigned ETPs for which it qualified, 
and the rebates provided in paragraph 
(B) in any Tape C ETP that meets the 
criteria of paragraph (1)(A) above.
18
As 
is the case today, rebates and stipends 
in paragraph (A) below will be in lieu 
of or in addition to, as specified, other 
rebates or fees provided under Equity 7, 
Sections 118 and 114. The rebates in 
paragraph (B) below will be in addition 
to other rebates or fees provided under 
Equity 7, Sections 118 and 114, 
including those in Section 114(f)(5)(A) 
(i.e., the proposed DLP incentives) and Section 114(g) (i.e., the proposed MQS stipend, as discussed below). The 
Exchange also proposes that the DLP 
will automatically be eligible to receive 
the relevant rebate or stipend in one of 
the following scenarios: (1) for the 
month of December 2025; or (2) for the 
current month of a new DLP allocation 
of a symbol (i.e., in the context of a listing transfer from another exchange or 
switching DLPs on a symbol). New 
launches will automatically get the Tier 
5 incentive for the current month. The 
Exchange will not have trading volume 
data for a newly-launched ETP for its 
first month, so it is proposing to 
automatically provide the DLP of the 
newly-launched ETP with the base Tier 
5 rebate in the first month. For listing 
transfers or DLP allocations, where there 
is trading volume data for these ETPs, 
that trading volume data would be 
applied to determine which Tier rebate 
or stipend the DLP would receive for the 
current month of the transfer or 
allocation. After the first month, the 
DLP will need to satisfy the MQMs 
relevant to their assigned ETP, as set 
forth in proposed Section 114(f)(4). 
DLPs would likewise receive the 
applicable Tier rebate or stipend for the 
first month of the proposed incentive 
program (i.e., December 2025) based on the relevant ETP trading volume data 
only because the Exchange seeks to 
encourage greater participation in the 
new program and allow DLPs to have 
adequate time to transition to the 
MQMs. After December 2025, DLPs will 
need to satisfy the MQMs relevant to 
their assigned ETP, as set forth in 
proposed Section 114(f)(4). 
Proposed paragraph (A) of Section 
114(f)(5) will set forth the amended DLP 
rebates and stipends. As discussed 
above, the Exchange is eliminating the 
distinction between standard and 
enhanced rebates, and removing the 
Secondary DLP rebates in paragraph (A). 
Instead, the Exchange will pay DLP 
rebates and stipends according to the 
following schedule: 
Tiers ADV  Rebate/stipend 
Tier 1 ................ ETP with monthly ADV greater than 1 million in the prior month ........................................... $0.0034 per executed share. 
Tier 2 ................ ETP with monthly ADV between 250,001 and 1 million in the prior month ............................ $0.0040 per executed share. 
Tier 3 ................ ETP with monthly ADV between 150,001 and 250,000 in the prior month ............................ $350 per month. Tier 4 ................ ETP with monthly ADV between 50,001 and 150,000 in the prior month .............................. $450 per month. Tier 5 ................ ETP with monthly ADV less than 50,001 in the prior month .................................................. $500 per month. 
In particular, the Exchange proposes 
to increase the fixed monthly payments 
(i.e., stipends) in Tiers 3–5 from $200 to $350 (Tier 3), $225 to $450 (Tier 4), and 
$300 to $500 (Tier 5). Tier 1–2 rebates 
will remain at the same levels currently 
provided for the standard DLP rebates. 
The proposed changes are intended to 
better incentivize DLPs to quote in 
lower volume and less liquid ETPs, 
recognizing that there may be higher 
costs to do so. The Exchange also

The Exchange notes that paragraph (5)(A) 
already specifies that for Tiers 3–5, the DLP will be 
eligible to receive a fixed payment per month in 
addition to any other rebate the DLP is eligible for 
under Equity 7, Sections 114 and 118. 
20
The term ‘‘market participant identifier’’ or 
‘‘MPID’’ means a unique four-letter mnemonic 
assigned to each Participant in the Nasdaq Market 
Center. A Participant may have one or more than 
one MPID. See Equity 1, Section 1(a)(11). 
21
As discussed below, the Exchange is proposing 
identical qualifications as a DLP for selecting an 
MQS. Specifically, an MQS shall be selected by 
Nasdaq based on factors including, but not limited 
to, experience with making markets in exchange- 
traded products, adequacy of capital, willingness to 
promote Nasdaq as a marketplace, issuer 
preference, operational capacity, support personnel, 
and history of adherence to Nasdaq rules and 
securities laws. See proposed Equity 7, Section 114(g)(2). 
22
See Equity 7, Section 114(f) for substantially similar provisions in the DLP program. The 
Exchange is not adopting the DLP program’s 
language around the incentive only being applied 
for executions $1 per share and above because this 
is only applicable to rebates provided per executed 
share and not a fixed monthly stipend. 
23
‘‘Low Volume’’ ETPs will have the same 
meaning in the MQS program as proposed in the 
DLP program, and shall mean ETPs with a monthly 
ADV of 1 million shares or less in the prior month. 
See proposed Equity 7, Section 114(g)(4)(A). proposes to clarify in paragraph (5)(A) 
of Section 114(f) that the Tiers 1–2 
rebates will be in lieu of any other 
rebate the DLP is eligible for under 
Equity 7, Sections 114 and 118. This is 
current practice today, but the Exchange 
is adding this language for transparency 
and to avoid potential confusion.
19
 
Unlike the Tiers 3–5 DLP stipends, 
which are additive, the Tiers 1 and 2 
DLP rebates are not because the 
Exchange is trying to greater incentivize 
DLPs to quote in lower volume and less 
liquid ETPs. 
Proposed paragraph (B) of Section 
114(f)(5) will set forth the amended 
additional Tape C incentives. As 
proposed, this will be provided to all 
eligible DLPs (and removing the 
references around Primary DLPs which 
is currently the case) that add liquidity 
in a Tape C ETP and will clarify that the 
DLP needs to meet the two DLP MQMs 
specified in proposed paragraph (4)(C) 
above. Specifically, the Exchange 
proposes to provide DLPs rebates in 
accordance with the following schedule: 
Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 3 Tier 4 Tier 5 Minimum Monthly Average Number of Assigned 
ETPs as a DLP and meeting the Average No-
tional Depth and Average Spread metrics in 
paragraph (4)(B).
20 ...................... 35 ...................... 75 ...................... 135 .................... 200. 
Incremental Tape C ETP Rebate ......................... $0.00025 per 
executed 
share.
$0.00035 per 
executed 
share.
$0.0004 per ex-
ecuted share.
$0.00045 per 
executed 
share.
$0.00055 per 
executed 
share. 
As proposed, the Exchange will 
increase the minimum monthly average 
number of assigned Tape C ETPs needed 
to qualify for each rebate tier, increase 
the rebates in Tiers 1–2 and decrease the 
rebate in Tier 4. The Exchange will also 
add a new Tier 5 rebate. The proposed 
changes reflect the growing number of 
ETPs listed on the Exchange, and are 
designed to expand liquidity support in 
Tape C ETPs and ensure that DLPs 
contributing to market quality in these 
ETPs are appropriately incentivized. 
Proposal 2: MQS Program 
The Exchange proposes to establish a 
new MQS program in new Section 
114(g) of Equity 7. The new MQS 
program is designed to complement the 
DLP program in Section 114(f) by 
allowing up to three members (i.e., 
MQSs) per ETP to participate in market 
quality improvement by providing 
liquidity for lower volume ETPs. The 
Exchange believes that allowing up to 
three MQSs will work to further support 
market quality in lower volume ETPs 
and increase resiliency in market 
quality performance. By incentivizing 
more than one MQS to meet the MQS 
Market Quality Metrics described 
below, lower volume ETPs would have 
more members that are incentivized to 
provide quote quality and layering of 
notional depth, which can enhance the 
market quality in an ETP overall. 
Specifically, new Section 114(g) will 
provide that the following stipend 
discussed in this section shall apply to 
transactions in a Qualified Security (as 
defined below) by up to three MQSs 
associated with its MQS program 
MPID.
20
The Exchange notes that a DLP 
(i.e., registered market maker) can also be designated as the MQS of a Qualified 
Security and be eligible to receive the 
MQS stipend proposed herein,
21
but an 
MQS is not required to be a registered 
market maker. These members are 
simply supporters who are trading in 
the ETP and have subsequently been 
designated as an MQS, but they are not 
subject to the same obligations as the 
DLP that is, in essence, the registered 
market maker (i.e., lead market maker), nor are they required to meet the 
registered market maker obligations in 
the ETP, as set forth in Equity 2, Section 
5. The Exchange believes that allowing 
any member to participate in the MQS 
Program (instead of limiting it just to 
registered market makers) would fortify 
participation in the proposed MQS 
Program, and enhance market quality in 
lower volume ETPs. 
In light of the above, the Exchange 
proposes in Section 114(g) that a DLP 
that is designated as the MQS of a 
Qualified Security may also be eligible 
to receive the MQS stipend herein, 
provided that the DLP meets the Market 
Quality Metrics in the DLP Program as 
specified in proposed Section 
114(f)(4)(B) described above as well as 
the MQS Market Quality Metrics as 
specified in this proposed Section 
114(g). The term ADV shall mean the 
total consolidated volume reported to 
all consolidated transaction reporting 
plans, for each individual security, by 
all exchanges and trade reporting 
facilities during a month divided by the 
number of trading days during the 
month. If a security is not listed for a 
full month, the number of trading days 
will only include the days which the 
security is listed.
22
 
Proposed Section 114(g)(1) will set 
forth the definition of Qualified 
Security, which will be defined for 
purposes of the MQS program in 
proposed Section 114(g)(1) as an ETP 
listed on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq 
Rules 5704, 5705, 5710, 5711, 5713, 
5715, 5720, 5735, 5745, 5750, or 5760, 
and has at least one MQS. The proposed 
definition will be identical to the 
current definition in the DLP program in 
Section 114(f)(1). 
Proposed Section 114(g)(2) will set 
forth the definition of MQS, which will 
be a market participant that has 
committed to maintain minimum 
performance standards in Low Volume 
ETPs.
23
An MQS shall be selected by 
Nasdaq based on factors including, but 
not limited to, experience with making 
markets in exchange-traded products, 
adequacy of capital, willingness to 
promote Nasdaq as a marketplace, issuer

obligations on Nasdaq to provide two-sided quotes 
in the security at all times within certain 
percentages from the NBBO. See Equity 2, Section 5.

maker.

preference, operational capacity,

adherence to Nasdaq rules and 
securities laws. The proposed definition 
will be similar to the definition of DLP 
in Section 114(f)(2) and the MQS will be 
selected using the same evaluation 
criteria as a DLP, except an MQS will 
not be required to be a registered market 
maker in the Qualified Security for the 
reasons discussed above.
24
 
Proposed Section 114(g)(3) will 
provide that if an MQS does not meet 
the performance measurements under 
paragraph (4) in this section for a given 
month, fees and credits will revert to the 
normal schedule under Sections 118(a) 
and 114. An MQS must provide 5 days 
written notice if it wishes to withdraw 
its registration in a Qualified Security, 
unless it is also withdrawing as a market 
maker in the Qualified Security, as 
applicable.
25
 
In proposed Section 114(g)(4)(A), the 
Exchange proposes to add a new 
Investment Strategy group framework, 
which will be identical to the 
framework proposed for the DLP 
program in Section 114(f)(4)(A) above. 
The Exchange will segment the Low

eligible for the stipend in paragraph (5) 
below, MQSs will need to meet the 
above MQMs in the assigned ETP as 
measured by Nasdaq. For leveraged and 
inverse ETPs, the average spread and 
auction spread metrics are multiplied by 
the absolute value of the leverage factor 
of the ETP. Because leveraged and 
inverse ETPs often exhibit higher price 
volatility relative to standard, non- 
leveraged ETPs, the MQS is often taking 
on higher risk and costs to take on these 
products. Adjusting these MQMs by the 
absolute value of the ETP’s leverage 
factor aligns the rebate structure with 
the MQS’s cost of taking these products 
on. These MQMs are measured on 
average in the assigned ETP during 
regular market hours, except for the 
auction spread metric that is measured 
directly before each auction against the 
metrics and averaged for the period. The 
Exchange also proposes that an MQS 
that is also designated as the DLP in a 
Qualified Security will need to meet the 
MQMs as set out in Section 114(f)(4) 
above to receive the MQS stipend. 
Proposed Section 114(g)(5) will 
provide that an MQS that satisfies the 
MQMs in paragraph (4) above will be 
eligible to receive the MQS stipend of 
$175 per month in each of its assigned 
ETPs for which it qualified. The MQS 
stipend will be a fixed payment per 
month in addition to other rebates or 
fees for which the MQS is eligible and 
provided under Equity 7, Sections 118 
and 114. This stipend will only apply to 
the MPID where a member is an MQS. 
Similar to the proposed DLP program, 
the Exchange proposes that the MQS 
will be automatically eligible to receive 
the MQS stipend in one of the following 
scenarios: (1) for the month of December 
2025; (2) for the current month 
following the new MQS allocation of a 
symbol (i.e., in the context of a listing transfer from another exchange or 
switching MQSs on a symbol); or (3) for 
the current month of new launches. 
After the first month, the MQS will need 
to satisfy the MQMs relevant to their 
assigned ETP, as set forth in Section 
114(g)(4)(B). 
Proposal 3: Technical Amendments 
The Exchange proposes technical 
amendments to reflect the addition of 
new Section 114(g). Specifically, the 
Exchange proposes to renumber current 
Sections 114(g)–(k) as Sections 114(h)– 
(l). The Exchange also proposes to 
update the cross-cite to current Section 
114(g) within the definition of 
‘‘Designated Retail Order’’ in Equity 7, 
Section 118(a). 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
27
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
28
in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges 
among members and issuers and other 
persons using any facility, and is not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. The 
Exchange notes that its ETP listing 
business operates in a highly- 
competitive market in which market 
participants, which include both ETP 
issuers and ETP market makers, can 
readily transfer their listings or opt not 
to participate, respectively, if they deem 
fee levels, liquidity incentive programs, 
or any other factor at a particular venue 
to be insufficient or excessive. The 
proposed rule change reflects a 
competitive pricing structure designed 
to incentivize issuers to list new 
products and transfer existing products 
to the Exchange, and market

As discussed in detail above, the Exchange is 
proposing to waive the MQM requirements and 
automatically provide the applicable DLP rebate/ 
stipend based on the trading volume of the relevant 
ETP in one of the following scenarios: (1) for the 
month of December 2025; or (2) for the current 
month of a new DLP allocation of a symbol. 
Further, the Exchange is proposing to waive the 
MQM requirements and automatically provide the 
Tier 5 stipend for the current month of a new 
launch. 
participants to enroll and participate as 
ETP market makers on the Exchange, 
which will enhance market quality in 
listed ETPs on the Exchange. 
Proposal 1: DLP Program 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed changes to the DLP program 
are reasonable, equitable, and not 
unfairly discriminatory for the reasons 
that follow. As a general matter, the 
Exchange must from time to time assess 
the effectiveness of the incentives it 
provides to market participants in 
return for the beneficial behavior 
required to receive the incentive. In this 
case, the Exchange is proposing to 
enhance the current DLP program in 
Equity 7, Section 114(f) by: (1) 
eliminating the distinction between 
Primary and Secondary DLPs, 
eliminating Secondary DLP rebates, and 
limiting the number of DLPs to one DLP 
per Qualified Security; (2) replacing the 
distinction between standard and 
enhanced MQMs (and associated 
rebates) with a single set of MQMs (and 
associated rebates); (3) adding a new 
Low Volume group framework; (4) 
replacing some of the current MQMs 
with more detailed MQMs; (5) 
increasing the fixed monthly DLP 
rebates for Tiers 3–5; (6) updating the 
qualifications, eligibility thresholds, and 
associated rebates for the additional 
Tape C ETP incentive; and (7) making 
non-substantive changes throughout 
proposed Section 114(f) to remove all 
references to ‘‘fees’’ as the Exchange 
would only provide incentives under 
the DLP Program and to add references 
to ‘‘stipends’’ to refer to the monthly 
fixed payments the Exchange would 
provide to eligible DLPs. Taken 
together, the proposed enhancements to 
the DLP program are intended to help 
the Exchange compete as a listing venue 
for ETPs, including with respect to Low 
Volume ETPs. Further, the Exchange 
notes that the proposed incentives are 
based on achieving certain objective 
MQMs. The revised MQMs are designed 
to encourage DLPs to uphold better 
quality markets in Nasdaq-listed ETPs 
and also ensure a scalable business 
model to support new and incubating 
ETPs that often trade less on a daily 
basis and exhibit less liquidity. The 
Exchange believes that providing 
incentives that are based on the quality 
of the market in individual ETPs, 
including those that generally have 
lower volumes and wider spreads, will 
incentivize DLPs to provide tight and 
deep markets in those securities. The 
proposed changes to the DLP program 
reflects a competitive pricing structure 
designed to incentivize market 
participants to direct their order flow to 
the Exchange and enhance market 
quality in Nasdaq-listed ETPs. 
The Exchange further believes that the 
proposed changes to add a Low Volume 
group framework in the manner 
discussed above is reasonable because 
the proposed framework is intended to 
more precisely calibrate the DLP rebate/ 
stipend qualifications in proposed 
Section 114(f)(4)(B) and additional Tape 
C incentive qualifications in proposed 
Section 114(f)(4)(C) to the liquidity 
profile of the investment strategy that 
the DLP’s assigned ETP falls under. In 
other words, segmenting Low Volume 
ETPs into three groups based on 2-year 
average NBBO spread is intended to 
better align the DLP’s performance 
expectations to the nature of the ETP’s 
investment strategy and structure. The 
Exchange believes that the proposed 
framework will encourage tighter 
spreads and more liquidity in 
investment strategies that may typically 
be less actively traded or exhibit wider 
spreads. The Exchange notes that other 
equity exchanges distinguish between 
different ETP investment strategies in 
their fee schedules to incentivize 
enhanced market quality in those ETPs, 
or have incentives in place to encourage 
greater market quality in lower volume 
ETPs.
29
 
The Exchange similarly believes that 
the proposed changes to increase the 
fixed monthly payments in Tiers 3–5 in 
the manner described above will 
incentivize DLPs to provide tight and 
deep markets in ETPs that generally 
have lower volume and wider spreads. 
The Exchange also believes that 
automatically providing the DLP the 
relevant tiered rebate or stipend for the 
current month of a new DLP allocation 
of a symbol, or of a new launch, 
automatically providing them the Tier 5 
stipend for the current month, is 
reasonable because the Exchange is 
providing the DLP with clear visibility 
into their rebate/stipend earnings at the 
time of the ETP’s launch or allocation. 
This approach is critical as ETPs may 
launch or be allocated a new DLP at 
various points throughout the month, 
potentially complicating the DLP’s 
ability to meet the monthly performance 
criteria proposed above and making it 
unclear on what rebates/stipends the 
DLP may expect. Furthermore, enabling 
the DLP to receive the rebate/stipend 
during the current month ensures they 
have sufficient runway to quote the 
product and maintain liquidity in the 
subsequent month as the first month of 
a new DLP allocation or new launch is 
often one where the ETP is more thinly 
traded and liquidity standards may be 
more difficult to meet. The Exchange 
also believes that automatically 
providing DLPs the applicable tiered 
rebate or stipend and waiving the MQM 
requirements for the first month of the 
new incentive program (i.e., December 2025) is reasonable because the 
Exchange seeks to encourage greater 
participation in the new program and 
allow DLPs to have adequate time to 
transition to the MQMs. 
The Exchange also believes that its 
proposal to amend the additional Tape 
C incentives by increasing the monthly 
average number of assigned Tape C 
ETPs needed to qualify for each rebate 
tier and to add a new Tier 5 rebate are 
reasonable because these modifications 
reflect the growing number of ETPs 
listed on Nasdaq. The Exchange also 
believes that the proposed rebates are 
set at appropriate levels, and will 
continue to incentivize DLPs to add 
liquidity in Tape C ETPs in order to 
qualify for these rebates. 
The Exchange also believes that the 
proposed enhancements to the DLP 
program, as described above, are 
equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory because the Exchange 
will apply the amended program 
uniformly to all registered market 
makers that are DLPs. The Exchange 
does not believe it is unfairly 
discriminatory to only offer the program 
to market makers because of their 
unique role in the markets, including 
their obligation to provide liquidity in 
the securities in which they are 
registered. Thus, the DLP program is a 
further extension of the market maker’s 
role in providing liquidity in specific 
securities, to the benefit of all market 
participants. Further, as discussed 
above, the Exchange is proposing to 
waive the MQM requirements in 
specified scenarios for a limited period 
of time such that DLPs would 
automatically receive the relevant DLP 
rebate or stipend.
30
The Exchange 
believes this proposal is equitable and

See supra note 30. 
32
As discussed in detail above, the Exchange is 
proposing to waive the MQM requirements and 
automatically provide the MQS stipend in one of 
the following scenarios: (1) for the month of 
December 2025; (2) for the current month of a new 
MQS allocation of a symbol; or (3) for the current 
month of a new launch. 
not unfairly discriminatory because the 
waiver would apply to all DLPs. As 
discussed above, enabling the DLP to 
receive the rebate during the current 
month ensures they have sufficient 
runway to quote the product and 
maintain liquidity in the subsequent 
month as the first month of a new DLP 
allocation or new launch is often one 
where the ETP is more thinly traded and 
liquidity standards may be more 
difficult to meet. As it relates to the 
proposed waiver for December 2025, the 
Exchange is seeking to encourage greater 
participation in the new DLP program 
and allow DLPs to have adequate time 
to transition to the MQMs. Further, this 
will be strictly limited to the first month 
of trading under the new program, after 
which the DLP must meet the MQMs set 
out in proposed Section 114(f)(4)(B) in 
order to qualify for the DLP rebates. 
Ultimately, the Exchange believes that 
all of the changes proposed for the 
enhanced DLP program, taken together, 
will promote price discovery and 
market quality in Nasdaq-listed 
securities and further, that the tightened 
spreads and increased liquidity from the 
proposal will benefit all market 
participants and investors by deepening 
the Exchange’s liquidity pool (including 
in lower volume and less liquid ETPs), 
offering additional flexibility for all 
investors to enjoy cost savings, 
supporting the quality of price 
discovery, enhancing quoting 
competition across exchanges, 
promoting market transparency, and 
improving investor protection. 
Accordingly, the Exchange believes that 
the proposal is reasonable, equitably 
allocated, and non-discriminatory 
because it would enhance market 
quality to the benefit of all market 
participants and investors. 
Proposal 2: MQS Program 
The Exchange believes that the new 
MQS program is reasonable because the 
program is designed to attract additional 
market makers to provide depth and 
tighter spreads in Nasdaq-listed ETPs 
that have lower volume and are less 
liquid. As discussed above, the 
Exchange is introducing a supplemental 
liquidity incentive framework focused 
on enhancing market quality in Low 
Volume ETPs. 
The Exchange believes that allowing 
up to three MQSs per Qualified Security 
is reasonable because it will further 
support market quality and increase 
resiliency by increasing coverage in 
Nasdaq-listed ETPs that have lower 
trading volume and wider spreads. 
Similar to the proposed DLP program 
discussed above, the Exchange believes 
that the proposed changes to add a Low 
Volume group framework in the manner 
discussed above is reasonable because 
the proposed framework is intended to 
more precisely calibrate the MQS rebate 
qualifications in proposed Section 
114(g)(4) to the liquidity profile of the 
investment strategy that the MQS’s 
assigned ETP falls under. In other 
words, segmenting Low Volume ETPs 
into three groups based on 2-year 
average NBBO spread is intended to 
better align the MQS’s performance 
expectations to the nature of the ETP’s 
investment strategy and structure. The 
Exchange believes that the proposed 
framework will encourage tighter 
spreads and more liquidity in 
investment strategies that may typically 
be less actively traded or exhibit wider 
spreads across all exchanges. The 
Exchange notes that other equity 
exchanges distinguish between different 
ETP investment strategies in their fee 
schedules to incentivize enhanced 
market quality in those ETPs, or have 
incentives in place to encourage greater 
market quality in lower volume ETPs.
31
 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed MQMs for the MQS program 
are reasonable as they are intended to 
enhance market quality by encouraging 
MQSs to provide depth, tighter quoted 
spreads, and better auction spreads in 
the open and close. The Exchange also 
believes that it is reasonable to require 
an MQS that is also designated as the 
DLP of the Qualified Security to meet 
the MQMs from the DLP program as 
specified to qualify for the MQS rebate. 
This change is intended to ensure that 
market makers earning incentives under 
both programs are delivering 
comprehensive market quality. Since 
DLPs would already be eligible to 
receive rebates under the DLP program, 
the Exchange believes that the 
additional MQS rebate should be 
reserved for DLPs meeting the requisite 
MQMs in proposed Section 114(f)(4)(B) 
and providing sufficient value under the 
DLP program. 
The Exchange believes that the flat 
monthly payment of $175 is set at an 
appropriate level to incentivize MQSs to 
enhance market quality in Low Volume 
ETPs. In addition, providing a flat 
stipend (as opposed to a per-executed 
share rebate) would provide for a more 
reliable business model for MQSs that 
choose to participate in this program, 
particularly in lower volume and less 
liquid ETPs. The Exchange also believes 
that automatically providing the MQS 
the stipend for the current month 
following the new MQS allocation of a 
symbol or following new launches is 
reasonable because the Exchange is 
providing the MQS with clear visibility 
into their stipend earnings at the time of 
the ETP’s launch or new MQS 
allocation. This approach is critical as 
ETPs may launch or get allocated to a 
new MQS at various points throughout 
the month, potentially complicating the 
MQS’s ability to meet the monthly 
performance criteria proposed above. 
Furthermore, enabling the MQS to 
receive the rebate during the current 
month ensures they have sufficient 
runway to quote the product and 
maintain liquidity in the subsequent 
month as the first month of a new MQS 
allocation or new launch is often one 
where the ETP is more thinly traded and 
liquidity standards may be more 
difficult to meet. In addition, the 
Exchange believes that automatically 
providing the MQS stipend and waiving 
the MQM requirements for the first 
month of the new incentive program 
(i.e., December 2025) is reasonable because the Exchange seeks to 
encourage greater participation in the 
new program and allow MQSs to have 
adequate time to transition to the 
MQMs. 
The Exchange also believes that the 
proposed MQS program is equitable and 
not unfairly discriminatory because the 
Exchange will apply the MQS program 
uniformly to all members that choose to 
participate as MQSs. Further, as 
discussed above, the Exchange is 
proposing to waive the MQM 
requirements in specified scenarios for 
a limited period of time such that MQSs 
would automatically receive the MQS 
stipend.
32
The Exchange believes this 
proposal is equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory because the waiver 
would apply to all MQSs. As discussed 
above, enabling the MQS to receive the 
stipend during current month ensures 
they have sufficient runway to provide 
market quality in the product and 
maintain market quality for the 
subsequent month as the first month of 
a new MQS allocation or new launch is 
often one where the ETP is more thinly 
traded and market quality standards 
may be more difficult to meet. As it 
relates to the proposed waiver for 
December 2025, the Exchange is seeking 
to encourage greater participation in the 
new MQS program and allow MQSs to 
have adequate time to transition to the 
new MQMs. Further, this will be strictly 
limited to the first month of trading 
under the new program, after which the

MQS must meet the MQMs as specified 
in proposed Section 114(g)(4)(B) in 
order to qualify for the MQS stipend. 
Further, the Exchange believes that 
the proposed MQS program will 
promote price discovery and market 
quality in Nasdaq-listed securities and 
further, that the tightened spreads and 
increased liquidity from the proposal 
will benefit all market participants and 
investors by deepening the Exchange’s 
liquidity pool (particularly in lower 
volume and less liquid ETPs), offering 
additional flexibility for all investors to 
enjoy cost savings, supporting the 
quality of price discovery, enhancing 
quoting competition across exchanges, 
promoting market transparency, and 
improving investor protection. 
Accordingly, the Exchange believes that 
the proposal is reasonable, equitably 
allocated, and non-discriminatory 
because it would enhance market 
quality to the benefit of all market 
participants and investors. 
Proposal 3: Technical Amendments 
The Exchange believes that the 
technical amendments to reflect the 
addition of new Section 114(g) are 
reasonable, equitable, and not unfairly 
discriminatory. Specifically, the 
Exchange proposes to renumber current 
Sections 114(g)–(k) as Sections 114(h)– 
(l). The Exchange also proposes to 
update the cross-cite to current Section 
114(g) within the definition of 
‘‘Designated Retail Order’’ in Equity 7, 
Section 118(a). The proposed changes 
will bring clarity and avoid potential 
confusion in Exchange’s Pricing 
Schedule to the benefit of all market 
participants and investors. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed changes consisting of the 
introduction of the DLP program 
enhancements and adoption of the MQS 
program will impose any burden on 
competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. Rather, the 
Exchange believes that the proposed 
changes, taken together, will enhance 
competition by improving the market 
quality in Nasdaq-listed ETPs, which 
will benefit all market participants 
through additional trading 
opportunities, tighter spreads, and 
enhanced price discovery. 
In terms of intra-market competition, 
as it relates to the DLP and MQS 
programs, the Exchange notes the 
respective programs will be applied 
uniformly to all similarly situated 
market participants that are DLPs and 
MQSs, as applicable. The Exchange 
does not believe it is unfairly 
discriminatory to only offer the DLP 
program to registered market makers 
because of their unique role in the 
markets, including their obligation to 
provide liquidity in the securities in 
which they are registered. Thus, the 
DLP program is a further extension of 
the registered market maker’s role in 
providing liquidity in specific ETPs, to 
the benefit of all market participants. 
The Exchange further believes that 
waiving the MQM requirements and 
automatically providing the applicable 
DLP or MQS rebate or stipend in the 
scenarios specified above (i.e., for December 2025, for the current month of 
a new DLP or MQS allocation of a 
symbol, or for the current month of a 
new launch) do not impose an undue 
burden on intra-market competition 
because the waiver would apply to all 
DLPs and MQSs. As discussed above, 
enabling the DLP or MQS to receive the 
rebate during the current month ensures 
they have sufficient runway to provide 
market quality in the product and 
maintain market quality in the 
subsequent month, as the first month of 
a new launch or new DLP/MQS 
allocation is often one where the ETP is 
more thinly traded and liquidity 
standards may be more difficult to meet. 
As it relates to the proposed waiver for 
December 2025, the Exchange is seeking 
to encourage greater participation in the 
new DLP and MQS programs, and allow 
participants to have adequate time to 
transition to the new MQMs. Further, 
this will be strictly limited to the first 
month of trading under the DLP and 
MQS programs, after which the DLP and 
MQS must meet all of the relevant 
MQMs in order to qualify for the 
applicable rebates or stipends. 
In terms of inter-market competition, 
the Exchange notes that it operates in a 
highly competitive market in which 
market participants can readily favor 
competing venues if they deem fee 
levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive, or rebate opportunities 
available at other venues to be more 
favorable. In such an environment, the 
Exchange must continually adjust its 
fees to remain competitive with other 
exchanges and with alternative trading 
systems that have been exempted from 
compliance with the statutory standards 
applicable to exchanges. Because 
competitors are free to modify their own 
fees in response, and because market 
participants may readily adjust their 
order routing practices, the Exchange 
believes that the degree to which fee 
changes in this market may impose any 
burden on competition is extremely 
limited. In sum, if the changes proposed 
herein are unattractive to market 
participants, it is likely that the 
Exchange will lose market share as a 
result. Accordingly, the Exchange does 
not believe that the proposed changes 
will impair the ability of members or 
competing order execution venues to 
maintain their competitive standing in 
the financial markets.

[OMB Control No. 3235–0507] 
Agency Information Collection 
Activities; Proposed Collection; 
Comment Request; Extension: Rule 
19b–5 and Form PILOT 
Upon Written Request, Copies Available 
From: Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 
100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549–2736 
Notice is hereby given that, pursuant 
to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(‘‘PRA’’) (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘SEC’’) is soliciting comments on the 
proposed collection of information 
provided for in Rule 19b–5 (17 CFR 
240.19b–5) and Form PILOT (17 CFR 
249.821) under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (‘‘Exchange Act’’) (15 U.S.C. 
78a et seq.). The SEC plans to submit this existing collection of information to 
the Office of Management and Budget 
(‘‘OMB’’) for extension and approval. 
Rule 19b–5 provides a temporary 
exemption from the rule-filing 
requirements of Section 19(b) of the 
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78s(b)) to self- 
regulatory organizations (‘‘SROs’’) 
wishing to establish and operate pilot 
trading systems. Rule 19b–5 permits an 
SRO to develop a pilot trading system 
and to begin operation of such system 
shortly after submitting an initial report 
on Form PILOT to the SEC. During 
operation of any such pilot trading 
system, the SRO must submit quarterly 
reports of the system’s operation to the 
SEC, as well as timely amendments 
describing any material changes to the 
system. Within two years of operating 
such pilot trading system under the 
exemption afforded by Rule 19b–5, the 
SRO must submit a rule filing pursuant 
to Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act 
(15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)) to obtain 
permanent approval of the pilot trading 
system from the SEC. 
The collection of information is 
designed to allow the SEC to maintain 
an accurate record of all new pilot 
trading systems operated by SROs and 
to determine whether an SRO has 
properly availed itself of the exemption 
afforded by Rule 19b–5, is operating a 
pilot trading system in compliance with 
the Exchange Act, and is carrying out its 
statutory oversight obligations under the 
Exchange Act. 
The respondents to the collection of 
information are national securities 
exchanges and national securities 
associations. 
There are 29 SROs which could avail 
themselves of the exemption under Rule 
19b–5 and the use of Form PILOT. The 
SEC estimates that approximately one of 
these SROs each year will file on Form 
PILOT one initial report (i.e., 1 report total, for an estimated annual burden of 
24 hours total), four quarterly reports 
(i.e., 4 reports total, for an estimated annual burden of 12 hours total (3 hours 
per report)), and two amendments (i.e., 
2 reports total, for an estimated annual 
burden of 6 hours total (3 hours per 
report)). Thus, the estimated annual 
time burden resulting from Form PILOT 
is 42 hours for the estimated sole SRO 
respondent. The SEC estimates that the 
aggregate annual internal cost of 
compliance for the sole SRO respondent 
is approximately $15,890 (42 hours at 
an average of $378.33 per hour). In 
addition, the SEC estimates that the sole 
SRO respondent will incur, in the 
aggregate, printing, supplies, copying, 
and postage expenses of $2,516 per year 
for filing initial reports, $1,256 per year 
for filing quarterly reports, and $628 per 
year for filing notices of material 
systems changes, for a total annual cost 
burden of $4,400. 
An agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
Control Number. 
Written comments are invited on: (a) 
whether this proposed collection of 
information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the SEC, 
including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of 
the SEC’s estimate of the burden 
imposed by the proposed collection of 
information, including the validity of 
the methodology and the assumptions 
used; (c) ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize 
the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including 
through the use of automated, electronic 
collection techniques or other forms of 
information technology. 
Please direct your written comments 
on this 60-Day Collection Notice to 
Austin Gerig, Director/Chief Data 
Officer, Securities and Exchange 
Commission, c/o Tanya Ruttenberg via 
email to PaperworkReductionAct@
sec.gov by February 23, 2026. There will be a second opportunity to comment on 
this SEC request following the Federal 
Register publishing a 30-Day Submission Notice.

typographical corrections or otherwise 
administrative or clarifying changes (such as 
changing a reference to ‘‘shareholder’’ to 
‘‘stockholder’’ to more closely reflect terminology of 
the By-Laws). 
17
Section 3.1(c) of the By-Laws defines 
‘‘Proposing Person’’ as (i) the stockholder providing 
the notice of business or the notice of the 
nomination, as applicable, proposed to be brought 
before an annual meeting, (ii) any beneficial owner 
or beneficial owners, if different, on whose behalf 
such business is proposed to be brought before the 
meeting or the notice of the nomination proposed 
to be made at the meeting is made, as applicable, 
and (iii) any affiliate or associate (each within the 
meaning of Rule 12b–2 under the Act for purposes 
of these By-Laws) of such stockholder or beneficial 
owner. 
18
See NASDAQ Exchange Notice, supra note 3, at 47420; proposed By-Laws Section 3.1(b)(iii)(C). 
19
The Exchanges propose a similar amendment 
to By-Law Section 3.2(a), which addresses 
requirements for requesting a special meeting of the 
stockholders, including procedures for determining 
the requisite percentage of stockholders necessary 
to support a special meeting request. See NASDAQ Exchange Notice, supra note 3, at 47421. 20
17 CFR 240.14a–9 (referred to as the ‘‘universal 
proxy rule’’). 
21
See, e.g., NASDAQ Exchange Notice, supra 
note 3, at 47421; proposed By-Laws Section 
3.1(b)(iii)(O)(3). Other amendments to the By-Laws 
under the Proposals also clarify when the universal 
proxy rule would apply. See, e.g., NASDAQ 
Exchange Notice, supra note 3, at 47421; proposed By-Laws Section 3.3(a) (relating to when Nasdaq 
would disregard nominees proposed by a 
stockholder under the universal proxy rule, if the 
stockholder has failed to comply has failed to 
comply with the rule). 
22
‘‘Board’’ is defined in Article I(c) of the By- 
Laws as the Board of Directors of Nasdaq. 
23
The Exchanges propose similar deletions of 
references to the decisions made in the ‘‘sole 
discretion’’ of the Board or to the finality or 
‘‘binding’’ nature of decisions by the Board (or 
persons authorized by the Board), any committees 
thereof, or the chairman of a meeting thereof 
throughout the proposed amendments. 
24
‘‘Issuer Director’’ is defined in Article I(o) of 
the By-Laws. 
25
See, e.g., NASDAQ Exchange Notice, supra 
note 3, at 47421–23. 
26
See, e.g., NASDAQ Exchange Notice, supra 
note 3, at 47423. The Proposals also remove the 
requirement that the chair of Nasdaq’s Audit 
Committee must be a Public Director (as defined in 
Article I of the By-Laws). See id. The Exchanges 
state that the chair of the Audit Committee must 
still satisfy prescribed independence standards. See 
id. With respect to the Audit Committee, the Proposals would amend the By-Laws to provide 
flexibility for such committee to be renamed from 
(‘‘DGCL’’) passed in 2022 and update 
the By-Laws to reflect recent changes in 
law and best practices. The Proposals 
were published for comment in the 
Federal Register on October 1, 2025.
3
 
On November 3, 2025, pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
4
the 
Commission designated a longer period 
within which to approve the proposed 
rule changes, disapprove the proposed 
rule changes, or institute proceedings to 
determine whether to disapprove the 
proposed rule changes.
5
The 
Commission did not receive any 
comment letters on the Proposals. This 
order approves the Proposals. 
II. Description of the Proposals 
The Exchanges propose amendments 
to the Certificate to exculpate covered 
officers from monetary liability for 
breach of fiduciary duty, similar to the 
existing treatment of directors.
6
As 
discussed more fully in the Notices, the 
Exchanges state that the proposed 
amendments would update the 
Certificate to reflect amendments to the 
DGCL that enable companies to limit the 
liability of certain officers in narrow 
circumstances.
7
 
The Exchanges also propose 
amendments to the following provisions 
of the By-Laws: Articles III (Meetings of 
Stockholders);
8
IV (Board of 
Directors);
9
VII (Officers, Agents, and 
Employees);
10
VIII (Indemnification);
11
 
IX (Capital Stock);
12
X (Miscellaneous 
Provisions);
13
XI (Amendments and 
Emergency By-Laws);
14
and XIII (Forum 
Selection);
15
as well as other non- 
substantive changes.
16
These 
amendments are summarized below and 
discussed more fully in the Notices. 
Proposed Amendments to Article III 
€Specify the scope of information that may be requested in connection 
with a stockholder nominee for director 
to provide that Nasdaq may require any 
other information to determine whether 
the proposed nominee is qualified 
under the Certificate, the By-Laws, and 
other applicable rules, laws, and 
regulations. 
€Amend the information requirements for notices to Nasdaq from 
a Proposing Person
17
regarding 
nominations or other business to be 
considered at an annual meeting of 
stockholders. Such notices require ‘‘a 
description of any agreement, 
arrangement or understanding with 
respect to the nomination or proposal 
between and among such stockholder 
and/or such beneficial owners, any of 
their respective affiliates or associates, 
and any others acting in concert with any of the foregoing’’ (emphasis 
added).
18
The amendments remove the 
references to others ‘‘acting in 
concert.’’
19
 
€Add a requirement that a Proposing Person’s notice must include a 
representation as to whether the 
Proposing Person intends, or is part of 
a group which intends, ‘‘to solicit 
proxies or votes in support of any 
proposed nominee in accordance with 
Rule 14a–19
20
promulgated under the 
Act.’’
21
 
€Limit the number of nominees that a Proposing Person may nominate for 
election at the annual meeting in certain 
instances to the number of directors to 
be elected at such annual meeting. 
€Remove a reference to the binding nature of the Board’s
22
determination 
with respect to whether a special 
meeting request is in proper form, 
which aligns the By-Laws with current 
Delaware corporate practices.
23
 
€Require that the chairman who presides over stockholder meetings shall 
be an officer or director of Nasdaq. 
Proposed Amendments to Article IV 
€Provide Nasdaq with greater flexibility to include ‘‘Issuer Directors’’ 
on the Board by removing the current 
restriction that the Board may not 
include more than two such directors.
24
 
€Amend the Board quorum and voting provisions to clarify how a 
quorum is calculated and the process for 
the adjournment of meetings. 
€Amend how notice of meetings may be given to, or waived by, directors (e.g., 
eliminate outdated forms of 
communication, such as telegram, 
telefax, cable, and radio). 
€Specify that Nasdaq is opting into Section 141(c)(2) of the DGCL, which 
provides Nasdaq greater flexibility with 
respect to the formation and powers of 
Board committees, including, for 
example, allowing greater delegations of 
authority.
25
 
€Remove limitations on the ability of Board committees to take certain 
actions, such as the authorization of 
preferred stock designations. 
€Remove the one-year limitation on the terms of committee members.

€Remove duplicative language in the By-Laws that specifies that members of 
the Nominating & Governance 
Committee may be removed by 
‘‘majority vote of’’ the Board, because 
the By-Laws already separately provide 
the voting standards for all decisions of 
the Board.
27
 
€Modify the quorum requirement for Board committees to specify that a 
majority of the members of a committee 
then serving in office, rather than a 
majority of total members on the 
committee, as is currently the case, shall 
constitute a quorum.
28
 
Proposed Amendments to Article VII 
€Delete outdated references to Nasdaq’s corporate structure, including 
references to having one President that 
is a director, or that has executive 
authority over the entire company, and 
add provisions that contemplate more 
than one president. 
€Make the specified list of officers to be elected by the Board permissive 
rather than mandatory. 
€Modify the process and authority for appointing Vice Presidents and 
providing that each Vice President shall 
have all powers and duties usually 
incident to the office of a Vice 
President, except as specifically limited. 
€Modify who may assign powers and duties to Presidents, Vice Presidents, 
the Secretary, and the Treasurer.
29
 
€Clarify that the obligation to pay claims or expenses related to the 
indemnification of directors, officers, 
employees, and agents is limited to 
those claims and expenses not 
prohibited by applicable law.
30
 
Proposed Amendments to Article IX 
€Broaden the scope of officers authorized to sign stock certificates. 
€Provide that applicable law will control whether Nasdaq is able to treat 
stockholders of record as shown on the 
stock ledgers as owners thereof and as 
the persons entitled to vote such shares 
and to receive notices, as well as when 
Nasdaq is bound to recognize any 
equitable claim to, or interest in, any 
shares on the part of any other person. 
€Provide that Nasdaq shall be authorized, rather than the Board or an 
authorized committee thereof, to take 
certain actions with respect to lost, 
stolen, or destroyed certificates. 
Proposed Amendments to Article X 
€Replace an existing provision regarding the authority for the execution 
of contracts and other documents with 
a provision that more closely reflects 
Nasdaq’s current policies and 
procedures on signatory authority. 
€Replace an existing provision regarding the required form of records 
with a provision that conforms to 
updated Delaware law.
31
 
Proposed Amendments to Article XI 
€Amend the By-Laws to reflect changes to the emergency by-law 
provisions of the DGCL.
32
 
Proposed Amendments to Article XIII 
€Provide a new forum selection provision.
33
 
III. Discussion and Commission’s 
Findings 
After careful review, the Commission 
finds that the Proposals are consistent 
with the requirements of the Act and the 
rules and regulations thereunder 
applicable to a national securities 
exchange.
34
Specifically, the 
Commission finds that the Proposals are 
consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act
35
 
in general, and, in particular, with the 
requirement of Section 6(b)(1)
36
that a 
national securities exchange be so 
organized and have the capacity to be 
able to carry out the purposes of the Act 
and to comply, and to enforce 
compliance by its members and persons 
associated with its members, with the 
provisions of the Act, the rules and 
regulations thereunder, and the rules of 
the exchange. The Commission also 
finds that the Proposals are consistent, 
in particular, with the requirement of 
6(b)(5) that the rules of a national 
securities exchange are designed, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest.
37
 
The Commission finds that the 
Proposals are designed to help to ensure 
that the Exchanges are so organized and 
have the capacity to be able to carry out 
the purposes of the Act, and to protect 
investors and the public interest. The 
Exchanges state that the proposed 
changes to the Certificate are in the 
public interest as they would update it 
consistent with developments in DGCL 
that enable companies incorporated in 
Delaware to limit the liability of certain 
of their officers in narrow 
circumstances. As discussed in the 
Notices, the Exchanges also state that 
such amendments are increasingly 
common for public companies; that the 
number of stockholder proposals calling 
for such amendments have continued to 
increase since 2022 when the DGCL was 
amended; and that the majority of these 
proposals have been approved by wide 
margins.
38
The Exchanges state that 
failing to adopt such amendments could 
potentially expose Nasdaq to higher 
litigation expenses and impact its 
recruitment and retention of officer 
candidates.
39
 
The Commission also finds that 
proposed amendments to the By-Laws 
are consistent with the Act. With 
respect to the proposed changes to the 
By-Laws, the Exchanges state that: 
€the proposed changes to Article III are in the public interest as they would 
update the By-Laws and conform them 
to current practices and developments 
in DGCL; 
€the proposed changes to Article IV are either clarifying in nature or 
otherwise purport to refine governance 
practices by providing Nasdaq with 
greater flexibility with respect to such 
matters as the qualifications of directors, 
quorum and voting, or otherwise update 
such provisions to make them more 
consistent with current governance 
practices as well as the policies and 
procedures of Nasdaq; 
€the proposed changes to Articles VII through XIII are in the public interest 
and consistent with the protection of 
investors as they are designed to 
accomplish several objectives, including 
updating the By-Laws to conform with 
current practices or recent 
developments in Delaware law, aligning 
the By-Laws with current Nasdaq 
policies and procedures, and enhancing 
the clarity of the By-Laws, thus 
facilitating their proper application and 
use; and 
€the remaining changes can be characterized as non-substantive, 
because they are designed to either 
correct typographical errors, conform

The Commission has previously stated that 
certain provisions in the Nasdaq governing 
documents are designed to ensure that each self- 
regulatory subsidiary can carry out its regulatory 
obligations. See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 78119 (June 21, 2016) 81 FR 41611 
(approving proposed rule changes by ISE, GEMX, 
and MRX relating to their acquisition by Nasdaq)

‘‘Crossing Order’’ is an order executed in the 
Exchange’s Facilitation Mechanism, Solicited Order 
Mechanism, Price Improvement Mechanism or 
submitted as a Qualified Contingent Cross order. 
For purposes of this Pricing Schedule, orders 
executed in the Block Order Mechanism are also 
considered Crossing Orders. See Options 7, Section 1(c). 
4
A ‘‘Firm Proprietary’’ order is an order 
submitted by a member for its own proprietary 
account. See Options 7, Section 1(c). Nasdaq governance documents to 
terminology in the By-Laws, remove 
obsolete text, or otherwise make non- 
substantive revisions to the By-Laws to 
make them clearer and easier to use.
40
 
The Commission finds that the 
proposed changes are designed to 
update the By-Laws for conformance 
with DGCL and litigation and corporate 
governance trends, conform the By- 
Laws with Nasdaq’s corporate structure 
and policies and procedures, or make 
other clarifying and non-substantive 
changes. With respect to the proposed 
changes to Nasdaq’s Audit Committee 
structure,
41
the Exchanges states that 
such committee must, in any event, 
satisfy other applicable independence 
standards.
42
Certain of the proposed 
amendments would also clarify when 
the universal proxy rule would apply.
43
 
Similar to the Exchanges’ proposed 
amendments to the Certificate, the 
proposed amendments to the By-Laws 
should help to ensure that the 
Exchanges are so organized and have 
the capacity to be able to carry out the 
purposes of the Act, and are designed to 
protect investors and the public 
interest.
44
 
IV. Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, the 
Commission finds that the Proposals are 
consistent with the Act and the rules 
and regulations thereunder applicable to 
a national securities exchange. 
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
45
that the 
Proposals (SR–NASDAQ–2025–080; 
SR–BX–2025–024; SR–GEMX–2025–27; 
SR–MRX–2025–23; SR–Phlx–2025–56; 
SR–ISE–2025–31) be, and hereby are, 
approved. 
For the Commission, by the Division of 
Trading and Markets, pursuant to delegated 
authority.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Nasdaq

Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed 
Rule Change To Amend Options 7, 
Sections 3 and 4 Regarding the 
Crossing Fee Cap 
December 18, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
15, 2025, Nasdaq GEMX, LLC (‘‘GEMX’’ 
or ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’ or 
‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III, below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Options 7, Section 3, Regular Order Fees 
and Rebates, and Options 7, Section 4, 
Other Options Fees and Rebates. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/gemx/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
GEMX proposes to amend Options 7, 
Section 3, Regular Order Fees and 
Rebates, and Options 7, Section 4, Other 
Options Fees and Rebates with respect 
the Crossing Fee Cap. 
Options 7, Section 4 
The Exchange currently offers a 
Crossing Fee Cap at Options 7, Section 
4,C. By way of background, Crossing 
Orders
3
are contracts that are submitted 
as part of a Facilitation, Solicitation, 
Price Improvement Mechanism, Block 
or Qualified Contingent Cross Order. 
The Crossing Fee Cap is $85,000 per 
month, per Member on all Firm 
Proprietary
4
transactions that are part of 
the originating or contra side of a 
Crossing Order. All eligible volume 
from affiliated Members is aggregated 
for purposes of the Crossing Fee Cap, 
provided there is at least 75% common 
ownership between the Members as 
reflected on each Member’s Form BD, 
Schedule A. Fees charged by the 
Exchange for Responses to Crossing 
Orders are not included in the 
calculation of the monthly fee cap. 
Surcharge fees charged by the Exchange 
for licensed products and the fees for 
index options as set forth in Options 7, 
Section 3 are not included in the 
calculation of the monthly fee cap. A 
service fee of $0.00 per side applies to 
all order types that are eligible for the 
fee cap. The service fee applies once a 
Member has reached the fee cap level 
and would apply to every contract side 
above the fee cap. A Member who did 
not reach the monthly fee cap is not 
charged the service fee. Once the fee cap 
is reached, the service fee applies to 
eligible Firm Proprietary orders in all 
Nasdaq GEMX products. The service fee 
is not calculated in reaching the cap. 
For purposes of the Crossing Fee Cap, 
the Exchange attributes eligible volume 
to the GEMX Member on whose behalf 
the Crossing Order was executed.

See 15 U.S.C. 78f(b). 6
See 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5). 7
See NetCoalition, 615 F.3d at 539 (D.C. Cir. 
2010) (quoting Securities Exchange Act Release No. 
59039 (December 2, 2008), 73 FR 74770, 74782–83 
(December 9, 2008) (SR–NYSEArca–2006–21)). 
8
15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(ii). 
At this time, the Exchange proposes to 
remove the Crossing Fee Cap from its 
Pricing Schedule in Options 7, Section 
4,C. The Exchange also proposes to 
remove note 8 at Options 7, Section 3 
that refers to the Crossing Fee Cap. Note 
8 of Options 7, Section 3 states, ‘‘Firm 
Proprietary contracts traded are subject 
to the Crossing Fee Cap, as provided in 
Options 7, Section 4C.’’ Finally, the 
Exchange proposes to remove references 
to note 8 in the tables in Options 7, 
Section 3. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
5
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
6
in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees, and other charges 
among members and issuers and other 
persons using any facility, and is not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The proposed changes to the Pricing 
Schedule are reasonable in several 
respects. As a threshold matter, the 
Exchange is subject to significant 
competitive forces in the market for 
order flow, which constrains its pricing 
determinations. The fact that the market 
for order flow is competitive has long 
been recognized by the courts. In 
NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission, the D.C. Circuit stated, ‘‘[n]o one disputes that competition for 
order flow is ‘fierce.’ . . . As the SEC 
explained, ‘[i]n the U.S. national market 
system, buyers and sellers of securities, 
and the broker-dealers that act as their 
order-routing agents, have a wide range 
of choices of where to route orders for 
execution’; [and] ‘no exchange can 
afford to take its market share 
percentages for granted’ because ‘no 
exchange possesses a monopoly, 
regulatory or otherwise, in the execution 
of order flow from broker 
dealers’....’’
7
 
Numerous indicia demonstrate the 
competitive nature of this market. For 
example, clear substitutes to the 
Exchange exist in the market for options 
transaction services. The Exchange is 
only one of eighteen options exchanges 
to which market participants may direct 
their order flow. Within this 
environment, market participants can 
freely and often do shift their order flow 
among the Exchange and competing 
venues in response to changes in their 
respective pricing schedules. Within the 
foregoing context, the proposal 
represents a reasonable attempt by the 
Exchange to attract additional order 
flow to the Exchange and increase its 
market share relative to its competitors. 
The Exchange’s proposal to remove 
the Crossing Fee Cap of $85,000 within 
Options 7, Section 4,C and note 8 in 
Options 7, Section 3 is reasonable 
because the Exchange no longer seeks to 
incentivize Members for executing a 
high volume of Firm Proprietary 
Crossing Orders on the Exchange. While 
the Exchange’s Crossing Fee Cap could 
have potentially lowered transaction 
fees for Members providing liquidity on 
the Exchange, the program did not 
attract Members. While the Exchange 
believed the Crossing Fee Cap would 
provide additional opportunities for 
market participants to interact with this 
Crossing Order Flow, contributing to a 
robust and competitive market, the 
Exchange notes that the fee [sic] did not 
achieve those goals and therefore the 
Exchange seeks to remove the fee [sic]. 
The Exchange’s proposal to remove 
the Crossing Fee Cap of $85,000 in 
Options 7, Section 4,C and note 8 in 
Options 7, Section 3 is equitable and not 
unfairly discriminatory as no Member 
would be eligible for the Crossing Fee 
Cap. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
Intermarket Competition 
The Exchange believes its proposal 
remains competitive with other options 
markets, and will offer market 
participants with another choice of 
venue to transact options. The Exchange 
notes that it operates in a highly 
competitive market in which market 
participants can readily favor competing 
venues if they deem fee levels at a 
particular venue to be excessive, or 
rebate opportunities available at other 
venues to be more favorable. Because 
competitors are free to modify their own 
fees in response, and because market 
participants may readily adjust their 
order routing practices, the Exchange 
believes that the degree to which fee 
changes in this market may impose any 
burden on competition is extremely 
limited. 
Intramarket Competition 
The Exchange’s proposal to remove 
the Crossing Fee Cap of $85,000 in 
Options 7, Section 4,C and note 8 in 
Options 7, Section 3 does not impose an 
undue burden on competition as no 
Member would be eligible for the 
Crossing Fee Cap. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act.
8
At any time 
within 60 days of the filing of the 
proposed rule change, the Commission 
summarily may temporarily suspend 
such rule change if it appears to the 
Commission that such action is: (i) 
necessary or appropriate in the public 
interest; (ii) for the protection of 
investors; or (iii) otherwise in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
If the Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (‘‘BZX’’ or 
the ‘‘Exchange’’) is filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ‘‘Commission’’) a proposed rule

II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Rule 11.9(c)(8) to clarify Pegged Order 
operation and to align BZX Rules with 
the rules of its affiliate exchanges in 
order to provide consistency amongst 
the Exchange and its affiliates. The 
Exchange notes that the proposed rule 
text is based on EDGA/EDGX Rule 
11.6(j) and is different only to the extent 
necessary to conform to the Exchange’s 
current rules.
5
The proposed 
amendment does not propose to 
implement new or unique functionality 
that has not been previously filed with 
the Commission or is not available on 
EDGA or EDGX. 
By way of background, Exchange Rule 
11.9, Orders and Modifiers, lists and 
describes the types of orders Users
6
 
may enter into the System,
7
including 
Pegged Orders as described in Exchange 
Rule 11.9(c)(8). A Pegged Order
8
is a 
limit order that after entry into the 
System, the price of the order is 
automatically adjusted by the System in 
response to changes in the NBBO.
9
A 
Pegged Order will peg to the NBB or 
NBO or a certain amount away from the 
NBB
10
or NBO,
11
as described in 
Exchange Rules 11.9(c)(8)(A) and 
11.9(c)(8)(B). Pegged Orders are not 
eligible for routing pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 11.13(b).
12
A new time 
stamp is created for a Pegged Order each 
time it is automatically adjusted.
13
 
A Pegged Order may be a Primary 
Pegged Order or a Market Pegged 
Order.
14
A Primary Pegged Order will 
have its price pegged by the System to 
the NBB, for a buy order, or the NBO for 
a sell order.
15
A User may, but is not 
required to, specify that such order’s 
price will offset the inside quote on the 
same side of the market by an amount 
set by the User (the ‘‘Primary Offset 
Amount’’).
16
A Primary Pegged Order is 
eligible to be displayed or non- 
displayed, however, the Primary Offset 
Amount for a displayed Primary Pegged 
Order must result in the price of such 
order being inferior to or equal to the 
inside quote on the same side of the 
market.
17
A displayed Primary Pegged 
Order with a Primary Offset Amount 
shall only include a time-in-force of 
RHO,
18
or if entered during Regular

See Rule 1.5(w). The term ‘‘Regular Trading Hours’’ means the time between 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 
p.m. Eastern Time. 
20
See Rule 11.8(b)(2). A time-in-force of Day may be applied to a limit order to buy or sell, which, 
if not executed, expires at the end of Regular 
Trading Hours. Any Day Order entered into the 
System before the opening of business on the 
Exchange as determined pursuant to Rule 11.1, or 
after the closing of Regular Trading Hours, will be 
rejected.

A Market Pegged Order has its price 
pegged by the System to the NBB, for a 
sell order, or the NBO, for a buy order.
21
 
A User entering a Market Pegged Order 
can specify that such order’s price will 
offset the inside quote on the contra side 
of the market by an amount set by the 
User (the ‘‘Offset Amount’’).
22
A Market 
Pegged Order is not eligible to be 
displayed on the Exchange.
23
 
Now, the Exchange proposes to 
amend the description of a Pegged 
Order under Rule 11.9(c)(8) to align 
with EDGA/EDGX Rule 11.6(j) and to 
clarify that a Pegged Order will not be 
eligible for execution where the NBB or 
NBO, as applicable, is no longer 
available. Further, the proposed rule 
text will provide that a new timestamp 
is created for an order that has been 
ineligible for execution and again 
becomes eligible for execution because 
the NBB or NBO it is pegged to becomes 
available. 
Currently, when the NBB or NBO 
becomes unavailable, a Pegged Order is 
cancelled back to the User. As proposed, 
instead of being cancelled back to the 
User, a Pegged Order will remain on the 
BZX Book. When the NBB or NBO that 
the Pegged Order is pegged to becomes 
available again, the order will receive a 
new time stamp and be eligible for 
execution. The proposed rule change 
provides additional detail with regard to 
the operation of Pegged Orders when 
the NBB or NBO, as applicable, is 
unavailable, that is currently not 
included in Exchange Rule 11.9(c). This 
proposed rule change does not propose 
to implement new or unique 
functionality that has not been 
previously filed with the Commission or 
is not available on EDGA or EDGX. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’) and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
24
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Section

requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged 
in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, 
and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
26
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The proposed rule change is designed to 
support the principles of Section 
11A(a)(1)
27
of the Act in that it seeks to 
assure fair competition among brokers 
and dealers and among exchange 
markets. 
The proposed rule change is intended 
to more thoroughly describe Pegged 
Order operation and to align BZX Rules 
with the rules of its affiliate exchanges 
in order to provide consistent offerings 
amongst the Exchange and its affiliates, 
which the Exchange believes is 
designed to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, thereby protecting investors and 
the public interest. Consistency amongst 
the rules of the Exchange and its 
affiliates, in turn, will promote rule 
compliance for Users of the Exchange 
that are also participants on EDGA and/ 
or EDGX. The proposed rule change 
does not propose to implement new or 
unique functionality that has not been 
previously filed with the Commission or 
is not described in the rules of its 
affiliate exchanges. By aligning BZX 
Rules with the rules of EDGA and 
EDGX, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change will remove 
impediments to the mechanism of a free 
and open market and protect investors 
by providing investors with increased 
transparency regarding rules that reflect 
the behavior of Pegged Order on the 
Exchange when the NBB or NBO, as 
applicable, becomes unavailable. As a 
result, the Exchange’s proposal will 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade and remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system. Additionally, the proposal does 
not permit unfair discrimination among 
customers, brokers, or dealers because 
the proposed Pegged Order behavior 
will apply to all Users equally in that 
any User’s Pegged Order will become 
non-executable in the event that the 
NBB or NBO, as applicable, becomes 
unavailable and a Pegged Order will 
receive a new timestamp when the NBB 
or NBO becomes available and the order 
again becomes eligible for execution. 
As described above, the proposed 
amendment is designed to ensure clarity 
in the Exchange’s rulebook with respect 
to the operation of Pegged Orders in the 
event that the NBB or NBO, as 
applicable, becomes unavailable. The 
Exchange notes that the proposed 
amendment is based on EDGA/EDGX 
Rule 11.6(j) and is different only to the 
extent necessary to conform to the 
Exchange’s current rules. Thus, the 
proposed amendment to Rule 11.9(c)(8) 
is directly targeted at removing 
impediments to and perfecting the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and national market system, as well as 
to assure fair competition among 
brokers and dealers and among 
exchange markets. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
Exchange notes that the proposed 
amendment to clarify Pegged Order 
behavior will provide consistent 
offerings amongst the Exchange and its 
affiliates. The Exchange does not believe 
the proposed change will have any 
impact on intermarket competition as 
the proposal is not being made for 
competitive reasons, but rather to align 
the text of BZX Rule 11.9(c)(8) with the 
corresponding rule text of its affiliate 
exchanges. In addition, the Exchange 
believes the proposed rule change will 
benefit all Users in that Users will have 
a more complete understanding of 
Pegged Order behavior when the NBB or 
NBO, as applicable, becomes 
unavailable. The proposed rule change 
will apply equally to all Users of Pegged 
Orders. 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed amendments will impose 
any burden on intra-market competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
The Exchange provides services in a 
highly competitive market in which 
participants may avail themselves of a 
wide variety of order types and order 
operations offered by self-regulatory

Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change 
revised the proposal by: (1) removing the proposed 
modifications to Nasdaq Rules 5810 and 5815 that 
would have accelerated suspension and delisting of 
any company that becomes non-compliant with 
certain quantitative listing requirements and has a 
market value of listed securities of less than $5 
million for a period of 10 consecutive business days 
(‘‘Accelerated Suspension and Delisting Proposal’’); 
(2) providing additional description and support for 
certain aspects of the proposal; and (3) making 
other technical and non-substantive changes for 
readability. The full text of Amendment No. 1 can 
be found on the Commission’s website at: https://

All capitalized terms not otherwise defined in 
this order shall have the meanings set forth in the 
Nasdaq Listing Rules.

Unrestricted Publicly Held Shares are shares 
that are not held by an officer, director, or 10% 
shareholder of the company and which are not 
subject to resale restrictions of any kind. See 
Nasdaq Rule 5005(a)(46). See also Nasdaq Rules 
5005(a)(23), 5005(a)(35), 5005(a)(38), and 
5005(a)(47) for the definitions of ‘‘Market Value,’’ 
‘‘Publicly Held Shares,’’ ‘‘Restricted Securities,’’ 
organizations, other broker-dealers, 
market participants’ own proprietary 
routing systems, and service bureaus. In 
such an environment, more detailed 
descriptions of the types of orders Users 
may enter into the System, such as the 
changes proposed in this rule filing do 
not burden competition, because they 
can succeed in attracting order flow to 
the Exchange only if they offer investors 
higher quality and better value than 
services offered by others. The Exchange 
reiterates that the proposed rule change 
to clarify Pegged Order behavior is being 
proposed in an effort to add consistency 
to offerings across the Exchange and its 
affiliates. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received comments on the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: 
A. significantly affect the protection 
of investors or the public interest; 
B. impose any significant burden on 
competition; and 
C. become operative for 30 days from 
the date on which it was filed, or such 
shorter time as the Commission may 
designate, it has become effective 
pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the 
Act
28
and Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
29
 
thereunder. At any time within 60 days 
of the filing of the proposed rule change, 
the Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

Granting Accelerated Approval of a 
Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by 
Amendment No. 1, To Modify Certain 
Initial Listing Requirements 
December 18, 2025. 
I. Introduction 
On September 4, 2025, the Nasdaq 
Stock Market LLC (‘‘Exchange’’ or 
‘‘Nasdaq’’) filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (‘‘Commission’’), 
pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’)
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
a 
proposed rule change to modify certain 
initial and continued listing 
requirements in Nasdaq Listing Rules 
5405, 5505, 5810, and 5815. The 
proposed rule change was published for 
comment in the Federal Register on 
September 19, 2025.
3
On September 25, 
2025, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the 
Act,
4
the Commission designated a 
longer period within which to take 
action on the proposed rule change.
5
On 
December 11, 2025, the Exchange filed 
Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule 
change, which superseded the original 
proposed rule change in its entirety.
6
 
The Commission is publishing this 
notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change, as modified by 
Amendment No. 1, from interested 
persons and is approving the proposed 
rule change, as modified by Amendment 
No. 1, on an accelerated basis. 
II. Description of the Proposed Rule 
Change, as Modified by Amendment 
No. 1

Nasdaq Listing Rules require that a 
company applying for initial listing on 
the Exchange must have a minimum 
Market Value of Unrestricted Publicly 
Held Shares (‘‘MVUPHS’’).

For initial

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60185 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Notices and ‘‘Unrestricted Securities.’’ The Exchange states 
that, like other liquidity requirements, the 
MVUPHS standard is meant to ensure that there is 
sufficient liquidity to provide price discovery and 
support an efficient and orderly market for the 
company’s securities. See Notice, supra note 3, at 45281. 
9
See Nasdaq Rules 5405(b)(1)(C), 5405(b)(2)(C), 5405(b)(3)(B), and 5405(b)(4)(B). 
10
See Nasdaq Rules 5505(b)(1)(B), 5505(b)(2)(C), and 5505(b)(3)(C). For a Company listing in 
connection with an initial public offering (‘‘IPO’’), 
including through the issuance of American 
Depository Receipts, these requirements must be 
satisfied from the offering proceeds. See Nasdaq Rules 5405(b)(1)(C), 5405(b)(2)(C), 5405(b)(3)(B), 
5405(b)(4)(B), 5505(b)(1)(B), 5505(b)(2)(C), and 
5505(b)(3)(C). 
11
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 102622 (Mar. 12, 2025), 90 FR 12608 (Mar. 18, 
2025) (SR–NASDAQ–2024–084) (Notice of Filing of 
Amendment No. 1 and Order Granting Accelerated 
Approval of a Proposed Rule Change, as Modified 
by Amendment No. 1, To Modify Certain Initial 
Listing Requirements). 
12
The Exchange states that when it made this 
change, it did not increase any of the numeric 
requirements for MVUPHS under any of the listing 
standards. See Notice, supra note 3, at 45281. 13
See id. The Exchange states that, prior to the 
new rule taking effect, less than one-third of 
companies on the Nasdaq Capital Market listed 
under the Net Income Standard. See id. at 45281, 
n.7. Since March 2025, when the change requiring 
companies to satisfy the MVUPHS requirement by 
proceeds of the IPO took effect, nearly three- 
quarters of companies listing on the Nasdaq Capital 
Market have listed under the Net Income Standard. 
See Amendment No. 1, supra note 6, at 6, n.11. 14
See Notice, supra note 3, at 45281. 15
The Exchange states that this change will align 
the MVUPHS requirement across all of the initial 
listing standards on the Nasdaq Capital Market. See 
id. 
16
The Exchange states that this change will avoid 
having a lower standard on the Nasdaq Global 
Market than on the Nasdaq Capital Market. See id. 
17
See id. 
18
See id. at 45282. 
19
In approving this proposed rule change, the 
Commission has considered the proposed rule’s 
impact on efficiency, competition, and capital 
formation. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(f). 20
15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5). 
21
The Commission notes that this reference to 
‘‘listing standards’’ is referring to both initial and 
continued listing standards. 
22
See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 
88716 (Apr. 21, 2020), 85 FR 23393 (Apr. 27, 2020)

listing on the Nasdaq Global Market, a 
company must have a minimum 
MVUPHS of $8 million under the 
Income Standard, $18 million under the 
Equity Standard, and $20 million under 
either the Market Value or Total Assets/ 
Total Revenue Standards.
9
For initial 
listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, a 
company must have a minimum 
MVUPHS of $5 million under the Net 
Income Standard, and $15 million 
under either the Equity or Market Value 
of Listed Securities Standards.
10
 
The Exchange recently modified the 
liquidity requirements for the initial 
listing of companies listing in 
conjunction with an IPO such that 
shares registered for resale are no longer 
counted for purposes of satisfying the 
minimum MVUPHS requirement.
11
As a 
result, a new company listing in 
connection with an IPO must meet the 
MVUPHS requirement based on shares 
being sold in the offering.
12
The 
Exchange states that, following this 
change, it has observed an increase in 
the number of companies applying for 
initial listing based on Nasdaq’s net 
income-based requirements, which 
require a lower MVUPHS than the other 
standards.
13
The Exchange states that it 
has observed problematic trading in 
companies with low public floats and 
liquidity, and the Exchange is 
concerned that companies initially 
listing with just $5 million or $8 million 
MVUPHS on the Nasdaq Capital or 
Global Market, respectively, may not 
trade in a manner supportive of price 
discovery.
14
 
Accordingly, the Exchange proposes 
to modify Nasdaq Rule 5505(b)(3)(C) to 
increase the minimum MVUPHS for 
companies listing under the Net Income 
Standard on the Nasdaq Capital Market 
from $5 million to $15 million.
15
The 
Exchange also proposes to modify 
Nasdaq Rule 5405(b)(1)(C) to increase 
the minimum MVUPHS for companies 
listing under the Income Standard on 
the Nasdaq Global Market from $8 
million to $15 million.
16
The Exchange 
states that it believes that these 
proposed changes will help ensure that 
there is a sufficient initial pool of 
liquidity available to support liquid 
trading on the Exchange.
17
 
The Exchange states that the proposed 
change will become operative 30 days 
after approval by the Commission.
18
 
III. Discussion and Commission 
Findings 
After careful review, the Commission 
finds that the proposed rule change, as 
modified by Amendment No. 1, is 
consistent with the requirements of the 
Act and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to a national 
securities exchange.
19
In particular, the 
Commission finds that the proposed 
rule change, as modified by Amendment 
No. 1, is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
20
which requires, among 
other things, that the rules of an 
exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest, and not be designed to 
permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The development and enforcement of 
meaningful listing standards
21
for an 
exchange is of critical importance to 
financial markets and the investing 
public. Among other things, such listing 
standards help ensure that exchange- 
listed companies will have sufficient 
public float, investor base, and trading 
interest to provide the depth and 
liquidity to promote fair and orderly 
markets. Meaningful listing standards 
also are important given investor 
expectations regarding the nature of 
securities that have achieved an 
exchange listing, and the role of an 
exchange in overseeing its market and 
assuring compliance with its listing 
standards.
22
 
The Exchange has proposed to make 
more rigorous certain of its initial listing 
standards for the Nasdaq Global Market 
and Nasdaq Capital Market to address 
recent market observations
23
and help 
ensure that an adequate level of 
liquidity exists for securities that are 
listing on the Exchange. As discussed 
above, the Exchange’s proposal will 
align the initial listing standards for 
minimum MVUPHS on the Nasdaq 
Capital Market by increasing the 
requirement for companies listing under 
the Net Income Standard from $5 
million to $15 million.
24
The 
Exchange’s proposal will also increase 
the minimum MVUPHS under the 
Income Standard on the Nasdaq Global 
Market from $8 million to $15 million, 
thus ensuring that the net income-based 
standard on the Nasdaq Global Market 
is not lower than the standard on the 
Nasdaq Capital Market.
25
 
According to the Exchange, 
companies listing under different initial

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60186 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Notices 26
See Notice, supra note 3, at 45282. 27
See Amendment No. 1, supra note 6, at 6. 28
See Notice, supra note 3, at 45282. See also supra note 8. One commenter stated that the proposal should be approved and that it supported 
the proposed change to initial listing requirements 
‘‘directionally insofar as it closes a loophole.’’ Letter 
from Jeffrey Starr, Managing Director, Head of 
Operations, Charles Schwab & Co., dated Dec. 16, 
2025 (‘‘Schwab Letter’’). This commenter stated that 
the Exchange should raise the initial listing criteria 
for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and adjust 
the minimum standards for all tiers upwards 
accordingly. See id. at 3. These additional recommendations are not before the Commission in 
the proposal being considered herein. 
29
The Commission also received comment letters 
addressing the Accelerated Suspension and 
Delisting Proposal and raising other concerns 
related to issues in trading exchange-listed low- 
priced stocks that fail to meet continued listing 
standards. See Schwab Letter; Letters from Katie Kolchin, CFA, Managing Director, Head of Equity 
& Options Market Structure, and Gerald O’Hara, 
Vice President & Assistant General Counsel, 
SIFMA, dated Nov. 14, 2025; Stephen John Berger, 
Managing Director, Global Head of Government & 
Regulatory Policy, Citadel Securities, dated Dec. 3, 
2025. See also Letter from Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr., President & CEO, SIFMA, dated Sept. 18, 2025, at 
4, n.13. The Exchange stated that it is considering 
the commenters’ proposed enhancements to the 
Accelerated Suspension and Delisting Proposal, and 
intends to resubmit a proposal to promptly suspend 
and delist companies that fail to meet minimum 
market value requirements. See Amendment No. 1, supra note 6, at 4, n.4. As discussed above, Amendment No. 1 removed the Accelerated 
Suspension and Delisting Proposal from the 
proposed rule change. See supra note 6. Thus, the 
areas of concern raised by the commenters are not 
before the Commission in the proposal being 
considered herein. In approving this proposal, the 
Commission is finding the proposal before us 
consistent with the Act. 
30
The one commenter that addressed the 
proposed increase to initial listing requirements 
supported that aspect of the proposal. See supra 
note 28. The other comments received on the Notice 
focused on the Accelerated Suspension and 
Delisting Proposal, which has been removed. See 
supra note 29. 31
15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2). 
32

listing requirements that meet the $15 
million MVUPHS requirement are less 
likely to be subject to volatile trading 
than similarly situated companies that 
meet the lower requirement for 
companies listing under the net income- 
based standard.
26
The Exchange states 
that the MVUPHS is an indicator of 
sufficient liquidity to help provide price 
discovery and reduce volatility.
27
 
However, based on observed problems 
with the trading of smaller companies, 
the Exchange states that it no longer 
believes it is appropriate to require such 
a significantly lower liquidity threshold 
for companies simply because they have 
a minimum level of net income, as 
opposed to companies that qualify for 
initial listing based on an equity or 
market value standard.
28
 
The Exchange’s proposal is 
reasonably designed to enhance its 
initial listing standards, particularly 
those involving issuers with low public 
float and liquidity, thereby protecting 
investors and the public interest. The 
proposal reasonably addresses a gap in 
the Exchange’s liquidity requirements 
for initial listing that potentially allows 
issuers that may not have sufficient 
levels of liquidity to list on the 
Exchange. Accordingly, the proposal 
should help to ensure that the Exchange 
lists only securities with a sufficient 
public float, investor base, and trading 
interest to provide the depth and 
liquidity to promote fair and orderly 
markets.
29
For these reasons, the 
Commission finds that the proposed 
rule change, as modified by Amendment 
No. 1, is consistent with the 
requirements of the Act.

V. Accelerated Approval of the 
Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by 
Amendment No. 1 
The Commission finds good cause to 
approve the proposed rule change, as 
modified by Amendment No. 1, prior to 
the thirtieth day after the date of 
publication of notice of the filing of 
Amendment No. 1 in the Federal 
Register. Amendment No. 1 narrows the 
scope of the proposed rule change and 
sets forth additional support and detail 
regarding the proposal. These changes 
include (1) removing the Accelerated 
Suspension and Delisting Proposal; (2) 
providing additional description and 
support for certain aspects of the 
proposal; and (3) making other technical 
and non-substantive changes for 
readability. Amendment No. 1 does not 
alter any substantive provisions of the 
remaining parts of the proposed rule 
change from what is set forth in the 
Notice, which was subject to public 
comment.
30
 
The Commission finds that 
Amendment No. 1 does not raise any 
novel regulatory issues that have not 
previously been subject to comment and 
is reasonably designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest, and not designed to 
permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
Accordingly, the Commission finds 
good cause, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) 
of the Act,
31
to approve the proposed 
rule change, as modified by Amendment 
No. 1, on an accelerated basis. 
VI. Conclusion 
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
32
that the 
proposed rule change (SR–NASDAQ– 
2025–068), as modified by Amendment 
No. 1, be and hereby is, approved on an 
accelerated basis. 
For the Commission, by the Division of 
Trading and Markets, pursuant to delegated 
authority.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; MIAX 
PEARL, LLC; Notice of Filing of a 
Proposed Rule Change To Amend 
Exchange Rule 402, Criteria for 
Underlying Securities, To List and 
Trade Options on Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares 
December 18, 2025. 
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (‘‘Act’’)
1
and Rule 19b–4 
thereunder,
2
notice is hereby given that 
on December 5, 2025, MIAX PEARL, 
LLC (‘‘MIAX Pearl’’ or ‘‘Exchange’’) 
filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (‘‘Commission’’) a 
proposed rule change as described in 
Items I and II below, which Items have 
been prepared by MIAX Pearl. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Exchange Rule 402, Criteria for 
Underlying Securities, to permit options 
on Commodity-Based Trust Shares. 
Specifically, the Exchange proposes to 
amend the rule to (1) redefine 
Commodity-Based Trust; (2) require 
additional qualifying criteria, based on 
the criteria outlined by the primary 
listing market to list options on a 
Commodity-Based Trust; and (3) require 
that the crypto asset held by the 
Commodity-Based Trust have a 
comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement. This filing also defines a 
crypto asset. Additionally, this filing 
proposes to amend Exchange Rule 
403(g) to update the relevant citations to 
Exchange Rule 402, which are revised 
pursuant to this filing. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/ 
us-equities/pearl-equities/rule-filings 
and at MIAX Pearl’s principal office. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, 
MIAX Pearl included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. MIAX 
Pearl has prepared summaries, set forth 
in sections A, B, and C below, of the 
most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
listing rules at Exchange Rule 402, 
Criteria for Underlying Securities.
3
 
Specifically, the Exchange proposes to 
amend the criteria for listing options on 
Exchange-Traded Fund Shares (‘‘ETFs’’) 
at Exchange Rule 402(i). This is a 
competitive filing substantively 
identical to the proposal submitted by 
Nasdaq ISE, LLC (‘‘ISE’’) to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ‘‘Commission’’), which was 
recently deemed approved.
4
 
The Exchange initially filed SR– 
PEARL–2025–08, as Modified by Partial 
Amendment Nos. 1 and 2, a proposed 
rule change to amend its listing rules at 
Exchange Rule 402, Criteria for 
Underlying Securities, to allow the 
listing and trading of options on 
interests in a Commodity-Based Trust 
on March 5, 2025, which was published 
in the Federal Registrar [sic] on March 
19, 2025.
5
On April 25, 2025, the 
Commission issued a notice designating 
a longer period for Commission action, 
which designated June 17, 2025, as the 
date by which the Commission shall 
either approve or disapprove, or 
institute proceedings to determine 
whether to disapprove the filing.
6
On 
June 17, 2025, the Commission issued 
an order instituting proceedings to 
determine whether to approve or 
disapprove the filing.
7
The Commission 
did not receive any comments on the 
proposed rule change. On September 8, 
2025, the Commission extended the 
time period for approving or 
disapproving the proposed rule changes, 
as modified by the applicable Partial 
Amendments, for an additional 60 days, 
designating November 14, 2025 as the 
date by which the Commission will 
either approve or disapprove the 
proposed rule change, as modified by 
the applicable Partial Amendments.
8
 
The Commission did not act to either 
approve or disapprove the proposal on 
or before November 14, 2025, therefore 
the proposal, as published in the 
Federal Register on March 5, 2025, was 
deemed approved as of November 14, 
2025.
9
On November 6, 2025, during the 
government shutdown, the Exchange 
submitted Amendment 3 to SR–PEARL– 
2025–08. The Exchange is now 
proposing the current change to reiterate 
the changes proposed in Amendment 3 
to SR–PEARL–2025–08 to codify the 
proposed rule text in the Exchange’s 
Rulebook. 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Rule 402 to adopt new listing criteria in

For example, a multi-coin ETF would not be 
subject to Exchange Rule 402(i)(6). For purposes of 
this rule the term ‘‘crypto asset’’ means an asset that 
is generated, issued and/or transferred using a 
blockchain or similar distributive ledger technology 
network, including but not limited to, assets known 
as ‘‘tokens,’’ ‘‘digital assets,’’ ‘‘virtual currencies,’’ 
and ‘‘coins’’ and that relies on cryptographic 
protocols. See definition at proposed Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(iii). 
11
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 103995 (Sept. 17, 2025), 90 FR 45414 (Sept. 22, 
2025) (Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Nasdaq 
Stock Market LLC; Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc.; NYSE 
Arca, Inc.; Order Granting Accelerated Approval of 
Proposed Rule Changes, as Modified by 
Amendments Thereto, To Adopt Generic Listing 
Standards for Commodity-Based Trust Shares)(SR– 
NASDAQ–2025–056; SR–CboeBZX–2025–104; SR– 
NYSEARCA–2025–54) (‘‘Generic Listing Standards 
for Commodity-Based Trust Shares Approval’’). The 
Exchange believes that it is appropriate to rely on 
the generic listing standards outlined by the 
primary listing market due to the potential 
proliferation of new primary listing markets and the 
Commission’s acknowledgment that the definition 
of shares of a Commodity-Based Trust across those 
primary listing markets is substantially identical. 
12
Shares of the applicable Commodity-Based 
Trust trade as equity securities. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 50603 (Oct. 28, 2004), 69 
FR 64614, 64619 (Nov. 5, 2004) (SR–NYSE–2004– 
22) (approving the listing and trading of 
streetTRACKS Gold Shares) (‘‘Spot Gold Approval 
Order’’) and ETP Request for Comments, infra note 
20, at 34731. See also Nasdaq Rule 5711(d)(ii); 
proposed BZX Rule 14.11(e)(4)(B); proposed NYSE 
Arca Rule 8.201–E(b) (Generic) (stating that 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares are included within 
the definition of a ‘‘security’’ as such term is used 
in the Exchanges’ rules and are subject to the 
Exchanges’ existing rules governing the trading of 
equity securities). 
13
The Exchange proposes to renumber current 
Exchange Rules 402(i)(5)(i) and 402(i)(5)(ii) to 
Exchange Rules 402(i)(6)(i) and 402(i)(6)(ii) for ease 
of reference, clarity, and consistency of the 
Rulebook. 
14
Exchange Rule 402(a) provides that a security 
(which includes an ETF) on which options may be 
listed and traded on the Exchange must be a 
security registered (with the Commission) and be an 
NMS stock (as defined in Rule 600 of Regulation 
NMS under the Act), and the security shall be 
characterized by a substantial number of 
outstanding shares that are widely held and actively 
traded. 
15
Exchange Rule 402(b) provides criteria and 
guidelines when evaluating potential underlying 
securities for the listing of options. 
16
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(i)(B) provides that the 
Exchange-Traded Fund Shares are available for 
creation or redemption each business day from or 
through the issuing trust, investment company, 
commodity pool or other entity in cash or in kind 
at a price related to net asset value, and the issuer 
is obligated to issue Exchange-Traded Fund Shares 
in a specified aggregate number even if some or all 
of the investment assets and/or cash required to be 
deposited have not been received by the issuer, 
subject to the condition that the person obligated 
to deposit the investment assets has undertaken to 
deliver them as soon as possible and such 
undertaking is secured by the delivery and 
maintenance of collateral consisting of cash or cash 
equivalents satisfactory to the issuer of the 
Exchange-Traded Fund Shares, all as described in 
the Exchange-Traded Fund Shares’ prospectus. 
17
The market supply information can be obtained 
from publicly available sources such as 
coingecko.com or coinmarketcap.com. subparagraph (i)(6) to permit the listing 
and trading of options on a Commodity- 
Based Trust that meets the generic 
listing standards for Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares of the applicable primary 
listing market, except that the 
Commodity-Based Trust holds a single 
crypto asset.
10
 
On September 17, 2025, the 
Commission approved proposals by The 
Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, Cboe BZX 
Exchange, Inc. and NYSE Arca, Inc., to 
Adopt Generic Listing Standards for 
Commodity-Based Trusts.
11
In the 
approval order, the Commission noted 
that each of the exchanges proposed to 
adopt substantially identical ‘‘generic’’ 
listing standards for Commodity-Based 
Trusts. Those generic listing standards 
define the term shares of a ‘‘Commodity- 
Based Trust’’ as a security
12
that: 
(1) is issued by a trust, limited 
liability company, partnership, or other 
similar entity (‘‘Trust’’) that, if 
applicable, is operated by a registered 
commodity pool operator pursuant to 
the Commodity Exchange Act (‘‘CEA’’), 
and is not registered as an investment 
company pursuant to the Investment 
Company Act of 1940, or series or class 
thereof; 
(2) is designed to reflect the 
performance of one or more reference 
assets or an index of reference assets; 
(3) in order to reflect the performance, 
is issued by a Trust that holds (a) one 
or more commodities or commodity- 
based assets, and (b) in addition to such 
commodities or commodity-based 
assets, may hold securities, cash, and 
cash equivalents; 
(4) is issued by such Trust in a 
specified aggregate minimum number in 
return for a deposit of (a) a specified 
quantity of the underlying commodities, 
commodity-based assets, securities, 
cash, and/or cash equivalents or (b) a 
cash amount with a value based on the 
next determined net asset value per 
Trust share; and 
(5) when aggregated in the same 
specified minimum number, may be 
redeemed at a holder’s request by such 
Trust which will deliver to the 
redeeming holder (a) the specified 
quantity of the underlying commodities, 
commodity-based assets, securities, 
cash, and/or cash equivalents or (b) a 
cash amount with a value based on the 
next determined net asset value per 
Trust share. 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Exchange Rule 402(i) to create a new 
subparagraph (6)(iii) that states,
13
 
Additionally, with respect to a 
Commodity-Based Trust that meets the 
requirements of Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6), the following requirements are 
satisfied: (A) the total global supply of 
the underlying crypto a held by the 
Commodity-Based Trust has an average 
daily market value of at least $700 
million over the last 12 months; and (B) 
the crypto asset held by the Commodity- 
Based Trust underlies a derivatives 
contract that trades on a market with 
which the Exchange has a 
comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement, whether directly or through 
common membership in the Intermarket 
Surveillance Group. For purposes of this 
rule the term ‘‘crypto asset’’ means an 
asset that is generated, issued and/or 
transferred using a blockchain or similar 
distributive ledger technology network, 
including but not limited to, assets 
known as ‘‘tokens,’’ ‘‘digital assets,’’ 
‘‘virtual currencies,’’ and ‘‘coins’’ and 
that relies on cryptographic protocols. 
The proposed additional criteria 
would require a Commodity-Based 
Trust to: (1) meet the generic criteria for 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares of the 
applicable primary listing market and 
hold only a single crypto asset; (2) meet 
the criteria and guidelines set forth in 
Exchange Rule 402(a)
14
and (b),
15
or 
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(i)(B); 
16
and 
meet the requirements in 402(i)(6)(iii) 
prior to listing options on the 
Commodity-Based Trust. 
As proposed, Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6)(iii) requires Commodity-Based 
Trust that meets the requirements of 
402(i)(6) to also satisfy the following 
requirements: (A) the total global supply 
of the underlying crypto asset held by 
the Commodity-Based Trust has an 
average daily market value of at least 
$700 million over the last 12 months; 
and (B) the crypto asset held by the 
Commodity-Based Trust underlies a 
derivatives contract that trades on a 
market with which the Exchange has a 
comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement, whether directly or through 
common membership in the Intermarket 
Surveillance Group (‘‘ISG’’). 
The Exchange defines a ‘‘crypto asset’’ 
at Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(iii) to mean, 
for purposes of this rule, an asset that 
is generated, issued and/or transferred 
using a blockchain or similar 
distributive ledger technology network, 
including but not limited to, assets 
known as ‘‘tokens,’’ ‘‘digital assets,’’ 
‘‘virtual currencies,’’ and ‘‘coins’’ and 
that relies on cryptographic protocols. 
The market value of the underlying 
crypto asset will be calculated by taking 
the total global supply of the particular 
crypto asset multiplied by the token 
price.
17
Total supply of crypto assets 
includes all crypto assets currently

For example, if Bitcoin were the underlying 
crypto asset, the Exchange would consider the total 
supply of all Bitcoin currently issued instead of the 
maximum supply, which would be currently issued 
as well as unminted Bitcoin. As of September 12, 
2025, Bitcoin’s total supply was 19,919,915 (the 
maximum supply was 21,000,000). See https://
www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin. The Exchange would calculate market value by utilizing 
the total supply number multiplied by the Bitcoin 
price on that day.

Exchange Rule 403(b)(5) provides, if an 
underlying security is approved for options listing 
and trading under the provisions of Rule 402(c), the 
trading volume of the Original Equity Security (as 
therein defined) prior to but not after the 
commencement of trading in the Restructure 
Security (as therein defined), including ‘‘when- 
issued’’ trading, may be taken into account in 
determining whether the trading volume 
requirement of subparagraph (3) is satisfied. 
21
See Exchange Rule 403(g). With this filing the Exchange is also proposing to amend Exchange 
Rule 403(g) to reflect the changes in numbering 
proposed herein for Exchange Rule 402(i). 
22
See id. 
23
Exchange Rule 403(b)(1) through (3) provides, 
if: (1) there are fewer than 6,300,000 shares of the 
underlying security held by persons other than 
those who are required to report their security 
holdings under Section 16(a) of the Act, (2) there 
are fewer than 1,600 holders of the underlying 
security, (3) the trading volume (in all markets in 
which the underlying security is traded) has been 
less than 1,800,000 shares in the preceding twelve 
(12) months. 
24
See Exchange Rule 404(b). The monthly expirations are subject to certain listing criteria for 
underlying securities described within Exchange 
Rule 404 and its Interpretations and Policies. 
Monthly listings expire the third Friday of the 
month. The term ‘‘expiration date’’ (unless 
separately defined elsewhere in the OCC By-Laws), 
when used in respect of an option contract (subject 
to certain exceptions), means the third Friday of the 
expiration month of such option contract, or if such 
Friday is a day on which the exchange on which 
such option is listed is not open for business, the 
preceding day on which such exchange is open for 
business. See OCC By-Laws Article I, Section 1. Pursuant to Exchange Rule 404(c), additional series 
of options of the same class may be opened for 
trading on the Exchange when the Exchange deems 
it necessary to maintain an orderly market, to meet 
customer demand or when the market price of the 
underlying stock moves more than five strike prices 
from the initial exercise price or prices. Pursuant 
to Exchange Rule 404(e), new series of options on 
an individual stock may be added until the 
beginning of the month in which the options 
contract will expire. Due to unusual market 
conditions, the Exchange, in its discretion, may add 
a new series of options on an individual stock until 
the close of trading on the business day prior to 
expiration.

Further, the Exchange has specified in 
proposed Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(iii) 
that the crypto asset held by the 
Commodity-Based Trust must underlie a 
derivatives contract that trades on a 
market with which the Exchange has a 
comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement, whether directly or through 
common membership in ISG.

The 
Exchange will be required to ensure that 
this requirement is met prior to listing 
options on a Commodity-Based Trust 
pursuant to proposed Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6). 
As a result of this filing, the proposed 
listing criteria would permit a 
Commodity Based Trust that is 
generically listed on the applicable 
primary listing market and holds a 
single crypto asset to qualify for the 
listing of options on that ETF, provided 
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(iii) has also 
been met, as well as the listing criteria 
in Exchange Rule 402(a) and (b), or 
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(i)(B). 
Similar to options on any ETF, an 
option on a Commodity-Based Trust 
that meets the requirements of Exchange 
Rule 402(i)(6) would also be subject to 
the Exchange’s continued listing 
standards for options on ETFs set forth 
in Exchange Rule 403(g). Pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 403(g), ETFs approved 
for options trading pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 402(i) will not be 
deemed to meet the requirements for 
continued approval, and the Exchange 
shall not open for trading any additional 
series of option contracts of the class 
covering that such ETFs, if the ETFs are 
delisted from trading pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 403(b)(4),
20
are halted or 
suspended from trading in their primary 
market.
21
Additionally, options on ETFs 
may be subject to the suspension of 
opening transactions in any of the 
following circumstances:
22
 
(1) in the case of options covering 
ETFs approved for trading under 
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(i)(A), in 
accordance with the terms of paragraphs 
(b)(1), (2), and (3) of Exchange Rule 
403;
23
 
(2) in the case of options covering 
ETFs approved for trading under 
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(i)(B), following 
the initial twelve-month period 
beginning upon the commencement of 
trading in the ETFs on a national 
securities exchange and are defined as 
an NMS stock, there are fewer than 50 
record and/or beneficial holders of such 
ETFs for 30 or more consecutive trading 
days; 
(3) the value of the index or portfolio 
of securities, non-U.S. currency, or 
portfolio of commodities including 
commodity futures contracts, options on 
commodity futures contracts, swaps, 
forward contracts and/or options on 
physical commodities and/or financial 
instruments and money market 
instruments on which the ETFs are 
based is no longer calculated or 
available; or 
(4) such other event shall occur or 
condition exist that in the opinion of the 
Exchange makes further dealing in such 
options on the Exchange inadvisable. 
Consistent with current Exchange 
Rule 404, which governs the opening of 
options series on a specific underlying 
security (including ETFs), the Exchange 
will open at least one expiration 
month
24
for options on a Commodity- 
Based Trust that are approved subject to 
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6) and may also 
list series of options on Commodity- 
Based Trust Share for trading on a 
weekly,
25
monthly,
26
or quarterly
27
 
basis. The Exchange may also list long- 
term equity option series (‘‘LEAPS’’) 
that expire from 12 to 39 months from 
the time they are listed.
28
 
Pursuant to Exchange Rule 404, 
Interpretation and Policy .06, which 
governs strike prices of series of options 
on ETFs, the interval between strike 
prices of series of options on ETFs 
approved for options trading pursuant 
to Exchange Rule 402(i) shall be fixed at 
a price per share which is reasonably 
close to the price per share at which the 
underlying security is traded in the 
primary market at or about the same 
time such series of options is first open 
for trading on the Exchange, or at such 
intervals as may have been established 
on another options exchange prior to the 
initiation of trading on the Exchange. 
With respect to the Short Term Options 
Series or Weekly Program, during the 
month prior to expiration of an option 
class that is selected for the Short Term 
Option Series Program, the strike price 
intervals for the related non-Short Term 
Option (‘‘Related non-Short Term 
Option’’) shall be the same as the strike 
price intervals for the Short Term 
Option.
29
Specifically, the Exchange 
may open for trading Short Term Option 
Series at strike price intervals of (i) 
$0.50 or greater where the strike price 
is less than $100, and $1 or greater 
where the strike price is between $100 
and $150 for all option classes that 
participate in the Short Term Options 
Series Program; (ii) $0.50 for option 
classes that trade in one dollar 
increments and are in the Short Term 
Option Series Program; or (iii) $2.50 or 
greater where the strike price is above 
$150.

list series of options pursuant to the $1

ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin 
Trust (BTC), the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust BTC, 
and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF. See Exchange Rule 402(i)(4). The Exchange filed rule proposals and

ETFs.

Pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 510, where the price of 
a series of options on a Commodity- 
Based Trust is less than $3.00, the 
minimum increment will be $0.05, and 
where the price is $3.00 or higher, the 
minimum increment will be $0.10

consistent with the minimum 
increments for options on other ETFs 
listed on the Exchange. Any and all new 
series of a [sic] Commodity-Based Trust 
options that the Exchange lists will be 
consistent and comply with the 
expirations, strike prices, and minimum 
increments set forth in Rules 404 and 
510, as applicable. 
Further, options on a [sic] 
Commodity-Based Trusts that are 
approved subject to Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6) would trade in the same 
manner as options on other ETFs on the 
Exchange. The Exchange Rules that 
currently apply to the listing and 
trading of all options on ETFs on the 
Exchange, including, for example, Rules 
that govern listing criteria, expirations, 
exercise prices, minimum increments, 
position and exercise limits, margin 
requirements, customer accounts and 
trading halt procedures would apply to 
the listing and trading of options on 
Commodity-Based Trusts that are 
approved subject to Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6) in the same manner. 
Position and exercise limits for 
options on Commodity-Based Trusts 
that are approved pursuant to Exchange 
Rule 402(i)(6) would be determined 
pursuant to Exchange Rules 307 and 
309, respectively, as is the case for other 
options on other ETFs. Position and 
exercise limits for options on ETF vary 
according to the number of outstanding 
shares and the trading volumes of the 
underlying ETF over the past six 
months, where the largest in 
capitalization and the most frequently 
traded ETFs have an option position 
and exercise limits of 250,000 contracts 
(with adjustments for splits, re- 
capitalizations, etc.) on the same side of 
the market; and smaller capitalization 
ETFs have position and exercise limits 
of 200,000, 75,000, 50,000 or 25,000 
contracts (with adjustments for splits, 
re-capitalizations, etc.) on the same side 
of the market. Further, Exchange Rule 
1502, which governs margin 
requirements applicable to trading on 
the Exchange, including options on 
ETFs, will also apply to the trading of 
options on a [sic] Commodity-Based 
Trusts listed pursuant to Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6). 
The Exchange represents that the 
same surveillance procedures applicable 
to all other options on other ETFs 
currently listed and traded on the 
Exchange will apply to the trading of 
options on Commodity-Based Trusts 
that are approved subject to Exchange 
Rule 402(i)(6).
35
The Exchange 
represents that it has the necessary 
systems capacity to support the new 
option series. The Exchange believes 
that its existing surveillance and 
reporting safeguards are designed to 
deter and detect possible manipulative 
behavior which might potentially arise 
from listing and trading options on 
ETFs, including the listing of options on 
Commodity-Based Trusts that are 
approved subject to Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6). Also, the Exchange may obtain 
information from designated contract 
markets that are members of the ISG 
related to a financial instrument that is 
based, in whole or in part, upon an 
interest in or performance of a crypto 
asset, as applicable. The Exchange has 
specified in proposed Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6) that the crypto asset held by 
the Commodity-Based Trust must 
underlie a derivatives contract that 
trades on a market with which the 
Exchange has a comprehensive 
surveillance sharing agreement, whether 
directly or through common 
membership in ISG.
36
The Exchange 
will be required to ensure that this 
requirement is met prior to listing 
options on a Commodity- Based Trust 
listed pursuant to proposed Exchange 
Rule 402(i)(6). 
Additionally, the Exchange has also 
analyzed its capacity and represents that 
it believes the Exchange and the 
Options Price Reporting Authority or 
‘‘OPRA’’ have the necessary systems 
capacity to handle the additional traffic 
associated with the listing of new series 
of ETFs, including options on a [sic] 
Commodity-Based Trusts, that are 
approved subject to Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6), up to the number of 
expirations currently permissible under 
the Exchange Rules. 
Finally, today, the Exchange lists and 
trades options on ETFs that would 
qualify for listing as an option on a 
Commodity-Based Trust under 
proposed Exchange Rule 402(i)(6),
37
and 
it has not identified any issues with the 
listing and trading of options on those 
ETFs. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the Act 
and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
38
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5)
39
requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged 
in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, 
and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
40
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
In particular, the Exchange believes 
that its proposal to establish new listing 
criteria at Exchange Rule 402(i)(6) with 
respect to options on Commodity-Based 
Trusts, without the need for additional 
approvals, will remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system and, in general, protect investors 
because it would allow the Exchange to 
immediately list and trade qualifying 
options on Commodity-Based Trusts, 
provided the initial listing criteria has 
been met, without any additional 
approvals from the Commission. 
Specifically, the Exchange’s proposal 
to adopt Exchange Rule 402(i)(6) to 
allow the listing and trading of options 
on units that represent interests in 
Commodity-Based Trusts that meet the 
generic listing standards for 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:11 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00135 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\23DEN1.SGM 23DEN1

See supra note 11. 
42
The following ETFs currently have options 
listed on them on the Exchange: iShares Bitcoin 
Trust, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, the 
ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin 
Trust (BTC), the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust BTC, 
and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF. See Exchange Rule 402(i)(4). The Exchange filed rule proposals and 
received the appropriate regulatory notice or 
approval to list the aforementioned options on the 
ETFs. 
43
See supra note 4. 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares of the 
applicable primary listing market,
41
and 
hold a single crypto asset, is consistent 
with the Act because it will permit the 
Exchange to offer options on 
Commodity-Based Trusts soon after the 
listing of the ETF on the primary listing 
market, provided that all the generic 
listing standards for that Commodity- 
Based Trust on that primary listing 
market have been met. Listing these 
options will avail market participants of 
the opportunity to hedge their positions 
in the Commodity-Based Trusts in a 
timely manner, thereby providing 
investors with the ability to hedge their 
exposure to the underlying Commodity- 
Based Trust. Options on Commodity- 
Based Trusts benefits investors, similar 
to the listing of any other option on an 
ETF, by providing investors with a 
relatively lower-cost risk management 
tool to manage their positions and 
associated risk in their portfolios more 
easily in connection with exposure to 
the price of a crypto asset. Additionally, 
listing options on Commodity-Based 
Trusts provides investors with the 
ability to transact in such options on a 
listed market as opposed to the OTC 
options market, which increases market 
transparency and enhances the process 
of price discovery to the benefit of all 
investors. 
Also, this proposal would permit 
options on Commodity-Based Trusts to 
be listed on the Exchange in the same 
manner as all other securities that are 
subject to the current listing criteria in 
Exchange Rule 402. The Exchange notes 
that the majority of ETFs are able to list 
and trade options once the initial listing 
criteria have been met without the need 
for additional approvals. The proposed 
rule change would allow options on 
certain Commodity-Based Trusts to 
likewise list and trade options once the 
initial listing criteria on the primary 
listing market have been met without 
the need for additional approvals. 
As proposed, the Exchange would list 
options in a Commodity-Based Trust 
that met the generic criteria of the 
applicable primary listing market, 
provided the Commodity-Based Trust 
held only a single crypto asset. Further, 
these options on Commodity-Based 
Trusts would also be required to satisfy 
the conditions in proposed Exchange 
Rule 402(i)(6)(iii). Specifically, a 
Commodity-Based Trust that met the 
requirements of proposed Exchange 
Rule 402(i)(6) would also have to satisfy 
the following requirements in proposed 
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(iii): (A) the total 
global supply of the underlying crypto 
asset held by the Commodity-Based 
Trust has an average daily market value 
of at least $700 million over the last 12 
months; and (B) the crypto asset held by 
the Commodity-Based Trust underlies a 
derivatives contract that trades on a 
market with which the Exchange has a 
comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement, whether directly or through 
common membership in the ISG. 
These requirements are consistent 
with the Act and the protection of 
investors as they should ensure that the 
underlying ETF has sufficient liquidity 
prior to listing options, which will serve 
to prevent disruption to the underlying 
market. The Exchange believes that 
market supply serves as a good measure 
of liquidity to prevent the addition of 
options trading on the Commodity- 
Based Trust from disrupting the market 
for the underlying security. Requiring 
the underlying crypto asset to have a 
requisite amount of deliverable supply, 
in addition to all the other criteria the 
ETF is required to have under the 
applicable primary listing market rules, 
should ensure adequate liquidity prior 
to listing. Further, ensuring the crypto 
asset held by the Commodity-Based 
Trust underlies a derivatives contract 
that trades on a market with which the 
Exchange has a comprehensive 
surveillance sharing agreement, whether 
directly or through common 
membership in the ISG, will provide the 
Exchange with information to 
adequately surveillance options on 
qualifying Commodity-Based Trusts. 
Today, the Exchange has a 
comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement in place with both the CME 
and Coinbase Derivatives through its 
common membership in ISG. This 
facilitates the sharing of information 
that is available to the CME and 
Coinbase Derivatives through their 
surveillance of their respective markets, 
including their surveillance of their 
respective digital asset futures markets. 
The Exchange also believes the 
proposed rule change will remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, because 
it is consistent with current Exchange 
Rules, previously filed with the 
Commission. Options on qualifying 
Commodity-Based Trusts must satisfy 
the initial listing standards and 
continued listing standards currently in 
the Exchange Rules applicable to 
options on all ETFs, including ETFs that 
hold other crypto assets already deemed 
appropriate for options trading on the 
Exchange in addition to the proposed 
criteria. Options on qualifying 
Commodity-Based Trusts would trade in 
the same manner as any other ETF 
options—the same Exchange Rules that 
currently govern the listing and trading 
of all ETF options, including 
permissible expirations, strike prices 
and minimum increments, and 
applicable position and exercise limits 
and margin requirements, will govern 
the listing and trading of options on 
qualifying Commodity-Based Trusts. 
The Exchange represents that it has 
the necessary systems capacity to 
support the listing and trading of 
options on qualifying Commodity-Based 
Trusts. The Exchange believes that its 
existing surveillance and reporting 
safeguards are designed to deter and 
detect possible manipulative behavior 
which might arise from listing and 
trading of these options on Commodity- 
Based Trust, particularly in light of the 
additional requirement that the crypto 
asset held by the Commodity-Based 
Trust underlies a derivatives contract 
that trades on a market with which the 
Exchange has a comprehensive 
surveillance sharing agreement, whether 
directly or through common 
membership in ISG. 
Finally, today, the Exchange lists and 
trades options on ETFs that would 
qualify for listing as an option on a 
Commodity-Based Trust under 
proposed Exchange Rule 402(i)(6),
42
and 
it has not identified any issues with the 
listing and trading of options on those 
ETFs. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. In this regard 
and as indicated above, the Exchange 
notes that the rule change is being 
proposed as a competitive response to 
the filing submitted by ISE.

The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposal to amend the listing 
criteria at Exchange Rule 402(i)(6), with 
respect to ETFs, to adopt new criteria to 
permit the listing and trading of options

hold a single crypto asset and that were 
listed pursuant to the generic listing 
standards for Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares of the applicable primary listing 
market, without the need for additional 
approvals, will impose any burden on

the Commission written notice of its intent to file 
the proposed rule change at least five business days 
prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule 
change, or such shorter time as designated by the 
Commission. The Commission is waiving this 
requirement.

For purposes only of waiving the 30-day

intramarket competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. Options on 
qualifying Commodity-Based Trusts 
would need to satisfy the initial listing 
standards set forth in the Exchange 
Rules in the same manner as any other 
ETF before the Exchange could list 
options on them. Additionally, options 
on qualifying Commodity-Based Trusts 
will be equally available to all market 
participants who wish to trade such 
options. The Exchange Rules currently 
applicable to the listing and trading of 
options on ETFs on the Exchange will 
apply in the same manner to the listing 
and trading of all options on qualifying 
Commodity-Based Trusts. 
Additionally, the Exchange notes that 
listing and trading options on qualifying 
Commodity-Based Trusts on the 
Exchange will subject such options to 
transparent exchange based rules as 
well as price discovery and liquidity, as 
opposed to alternatively trading such 
options in the OTC market. The 
Exchange believes that the proposed 
rule change may relieve any burden on, 
or otherwise promote, competition as it 
is designed to increase competition for 
order flow on the Exchange in a manner 
that is beneficial to investors by 
providing them with a lower-cost option 
to hedge their investment portfolios in 
a timely manner. 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposal to adopt new listing 
criteria at Exchange Rule 402(i)(6) to 
permit the listing and trading of certain 
options on a Commodity-Based Trust, 
without the need for additional 
approvals, will impose any burden on 
intermarket competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. Other 
options exchanges are free to amend 
their applicable rules to permit them to 
list and trade options on Commodity- 
Based Trusts. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
Written comments were neither 
solicited nor received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: (i) significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant 
burden on competition; and (iii) become 
operative for 30 days from the date on 
which it was filed, or such shorter time 
as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
44
and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b–4 
thereunder.
45
 
A proposed rule change filed under 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
46
normally does not 
become operative prior to 30 days after 
the date of the filing. However, pursuant 
to Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii),
47
the 
Commission may designate a shorter 
time if such action is consistent with 
protection of investors and the public 
interest. The Exchange has asked the 
Commission to waive the 30-day 
operative delay so that the proposed 
rule change may become operative 
immediately upon filing. The 
Commission believes that waiving 30- 
day operative delay is consistent with 
the protection of investors and the 
public interest because the proposal 
seeks to amend the Exchange’s rules to 
be consistent with an amendment filed 
by the Exchange during a government 
shutdown, and which would have 
replaced the proposed rule change that 
did become effective if the Commission 
could have received amendments 
during the pendency of the government 
shutdown.
48
The proposal also aligns 
the rule text relating to Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares with the rule text of 
other exchanges and does not introduce 
any novel regulatory issues.
49
 
Accordingly, the Commission 
designates the proposed rule change to 
be operative upon filing.
50
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

‘‘Priority Customer’’ means a person or entity 
that (i) is not a broker or dealer in securities, and 
(ii) does not place more than 390 orders in listed 
options per day on average during a calendar month 
for its own beneficial account(s). The number of 
orders shall be counted in accordance with 
Interpretation and Policy .01 of Exchange Rule 100. 
See the Definitions section of the Fee Schedule and Exchange Rule 100, including Interpretation and 
Policy .01.

‘‘Affiliate’’ means (i) an affiliate of a Member of 
at least 75% common ownership between the firms 
as reflected on each firm’s Form BD, Schedule A, 
or (ii) the Appointed Market Maker of an Appointed 
EEM (or, conversely, the Appointed EEM of an 
Appointed Market Maker). An ‘‘Appointed Market 
Maker’’ is a MIAX Emerald Market Maker (who 
does not otherwise have a corporate affiliation 
based upon common ownership with an EEM) that 
has been appointed by an EEM and an ‘‘Appointed 
EEM’’ is an EEM (who does not otherwise have a 
corporate affiliation based upon common 
ownership with a MIAX Emerald Market Maker) 
that has been appointed by a MIAX Emerald Market 
Maker, pursuant to the following process. A MIAX 
Emerald Market Maker appoints an EEM and an 
EEM appoints a MIAX Emerald Market Maker, for 
the purposes of the Fee Schedule, by each 
completing and sending an executed Volume 
Aggregation Request Form by email to 
membership@miaxglobal.com no later than 2 business days prior to the first business day of the 
month in which the designation is to become 
effective. Transmittal of a validly completed and 
executed form to the Exchange along with the 
Exchange’s acknowledgement of the effective 
designation to each of the Market Maker and EEM 
will be viewed as acceptance of the appointment. 
The Exchange will only recognize one designation 
per Member. A Member may make a designation 
not more than once every 12 months (from the date 
of its most recent designation), which designation 
shall remain in effect unless or until the Exchange 
receives written notice submitted 2 business days 
prior to the first business day of the month from 
either Member indicating that the appointment has 
been terminated. Designations will become 
operative on the first business day of the effective 
month and may not be terminated prior to the end 
of the month. Execution data and reports will be 
provided to both parties. See the Definitions Section of the Fee Schedule.

‘‘Market Maker’’ refers to ‘‘Lead Market Maker’’ 
(‘‘LMM’’), ‘‘Primary Lead Market Maker’’ (‘‘PLMM’’) 
and ‘‘Registered Market Maker’’ (‘‘RMM’’), 
collectively. See the Definitions Section of the Fee Schedule and Exchange Rule 100.

The three alternative volume calculation 
methods are as follows. Method 1 is calculated by 
total Member sides volume as a percentage of 
CTCV. Method 2 is calculated by total MIAX 
Emerald Market Maker sides volume as a 
percentage of CTCV. Method 3 is calculated by total 
Priority Customer, Maker sides volume as a 
percentage of CTCV. See Fee Schedule, Section 1)a)ii) (also providing the volume threshold 
percentages for Tiers 1–4 for each volume 
calculation method). The Tier applied for a Member 
and its Affiliates’ Priority Customer origin will 
solely be determined by Method 3. The Tier applied 
for a Member and its Affiliates’ Market Maker and 
other professional origins (non-MIAX Emerald 
Market Maker, Firm Proprietary/Broker-Dealer, and 
Non-Priority Customer) will be the highest Tier 
achieved among the three alternative calculation 
methods. Id. 7
‘‘Member’’ means an individual or organization 
approved to exercise the trading rights associated 
with a Trading Permit. Members are deemed 
‘‘members’’ under the Exchange Act. See the Definitions section of the Fee Schedule and

notice is hereby given that on December 
10, 2025, MIAX Emerald, LLC (‘‘MIAX 
Emerald’’ or ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend the 
MIAX Emerald Options Exchange Fee 
Schedule (the ‘‘Fee Schedule’’) to 
establish alternative Simple Maker (as 
defined below) rebates for options 
transactions in Penny classes and non- 
Penny classes (as defined below) in Tier

and at the Exchange’s principal office. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Section 1)a)i) of the Fee Schedule to 
establish alternative Simple Maker (as 
defined below) rebates for options 
transactions in Penny classes and non- 
Penny classes (as defined below) in Tier 
4 for executed Priority Customer orders 
when the contra-side is an Affiliated 
Market Maker and certain volume 
thresholds are met. The Exchange 
initially filed this proposal on December 
1, 2025 (SR–EMERALD–2025–19). On 
December 10, 2025, the Exchange 
withdrew SR–EMERALD–2025–19 and 
refiled this proposed rule change. 
Background 
The Exchange currently provides 
transaction rebates and assesses 
transaction fees to all market 
participants based upon a threshold tier 
structure (‘‘Tier’’) that is applicable to 
all transactions. Tiers are determined on 
a monthly basis and are based on three 
alternative volume calculation methods, 
as described in Section 1)a)ii) of the Fee 
Schedule.
6
Each method is calculated 
based on the total monthly sides 
executed by the Member
7
in all options 
classes on MIAX Emerald in the 
relevant origin(s) and/or applicable 
liquidity (i.e., Priority Customer Maker), not including Excluded Contracts,

the numerator) expressed as a 
percentage of (divided by) Customer

the period of time in which the Exchange 
experiences an Exchange System Disruption (solely 
in the option classes of the affected Matching 
Engine). The term ‘‘Exchange System Disruption’’ 
means an outage of a Matching Engine or collective 
Matching Engines for a period of two consecutive 
hour or more, during trading hours. See the Definitions Section of the Fee Schedule.

The Exchange notes that references to ‘‘total 
Market Maker sides volume’’ in the proposed new 
text includes aggregated volume of the Member and 
its Affiliates. See Fee Schedule, Section 1)a)ii) (explanatory paragraph below the table of ‘Tiers and 
their Application’). 
12
In the initial version of this proposal (SR– 
EMERALD–2025–19), the Exchange used the term 
‘‘at least’’ when referring to the minimum 
alternative volume thresholds that Members would 
be required to meet (i.e., at least 0.90% of total Market Maker sides volume and at least 0.60% of 
total Priority Customer, Maker sides volume). The 
Exchange notes that the term ‘‘at least’’ was 
inadvertently used when the correct term ‘‘above’’ 
should have been used when referring to the 
minimum alternative volume thresholds that 
Members would be required to meet (i.e., above 0.90% of total Market Maker sides volume and 
above 0.60% of total Priority Customer, Maker sides 
volume). These changes were made to the Exhibit 
5 for this filing. The Exchange notes that these 
proposed changes do not impact any Member that 
has met the alternative Simple Maker rebates 
described herein at the time of this refiling.

(as the denominator). The per contract 
transaction rebates and fees shall be 
applied retroactively to all eligible 
volume once the Tier has been reached 
by the Member. The Exchange 
aggregates the volume of Members and 
their Affiliates in the Tiers. Members 
that place resting liquidity, i.e., orders on the MIAX Emerald System, will be 
assessed the specified ‘‘maker’’ rebate or 
fee (each a ‘‘Maker’’) and Members that 
execute against resting liquidity will be 
assessed the specified ‘‘taker’’ fee or 
rebate (each a ‘‘Taker’’). Members are 
also assessed lower transaction fees and 
provided lower rebates for order 
executions in standard option classes in 
the Penny Interval Program

(‘‘Penny 
classes’’) than for order executions in 
standard option classes which are not in 
the Penny Interval Program (‘‘non- 
Penny classes’’), for which Members 
will be assessed higher transaction fees 
and receive higher rebates. 
Proposal 
The Exchange proposes to establish 
alternative Simple Maker rebates for 
options transactions in Penny classes 
and non-Penny classes in Tier 4 for 
executed Priority Customer orders when 
the contra-side is an Affiliated Market 
Maker and certain volume thresholds 
are met. Currently, the Exchange 
provides Simple Maker rebates of 
($0.53) and ($1.05) for options 
transactions in Penny classes and non- 
Penny classes in Tier 4, respectively, for 
executed Priority Customer orders when 
the contra-side is not an Affiliated 
Market Maker. The Exchange provides 
reduced Simple Maker rebates of ($0.37) 
and ($0.85) for options transactions in 
Penny classes and non-Penny classes in 
Tier 4, respectively, for executed 
Priority Customer orders when the 
contra-side is an Affiliated Market 
Maker. The reduced Simple Maker 
rebate for Penny classes is denoted by 
footnote ‘‘˜’’ and the reduced Simple 
Maker rebate for non-Penny classes is 
denoted by footnote ‘‘0’’ following the 
tables of transaction fees and rebates in 
Section 1)a)i) of the Fee Schedule. 
The Exchange proposes to establish 
the following alternative Simple Maker 
rebates for options transactions in 
Penny classes and non-Penny classes in 
Tier 4 for executed Priority Customer 
orders when the contra-side is an 
Affiliated Market Maker and the 
Member achieves certain volume 
thresholds. In particular, the Exchange 
proposes to add the following sentence 
to footnote ‘‘˜’’:
11
 
When the contra is an Affiliated 
Market Maker and the Member has 
achieved above 0.90% of total Market 
Maker sides volume and above 0.60% of 
total Priority Customer, Maker sides 
volume, both thresholds as a percentage 
of CTCV, this Maker rebate for executed 
Priority Customer Simple Orders will be 
($0.49). 
The Exchange also proposes to add 
the following sentence to footnote ‘‘0’’: 
When the contra is an Affiliated 
Market Maker and the Member has 
achieved above 0.90% of total Market 
Maker sides volume and above 0.60% of 
total Priority Customer, Maker sides 
volume, both thresholds as a percentage 
of CTCV, this Maker rebate for executed 
Priority Customer Simple Orders will be 
($0.95).
12
 
The purpose of the proposed changes 
is for business and competitive reasons 
in order to attract additional Priority 
Customer volume. The Exchange 
believes that this may, in turn, 
encourage Members to submit more 
Priority Customer orders, leading to 
increased liquidity on the Exchange to 
the benefit of all market participants by 
providing more trading opportunities 
and tighter spreads. The proposed 
changes may also provide an incentive 
for Market Makers to interact with more 
Priority Customer liquidity in Penny 
and non-Penny classes, thereby 
promoting price discovery and 
contributing to a deeper and more liquid 
market, which benefits all market 
participants and enhances the 
attractiveness of the Exchange as a 
trading venue. The Exchange also notes 
that other equity options exchanges 
provide for different pricing dependent 
upon whether the executing buyer and 
seller are the same market participant, 
have some form of common ownership, 
and/or based upon certain volume 
thresholds in different segments.
13
 
Implementation 
The proposed changes are 
immediately effective. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal to amend the Fee Schedule is 
consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act
14
 
in general, and furthers the objectives of 
Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,
15
in that it is 
an equitable allocation of reasonable 
dues, fees and other charges among 
Exchange Members and issuers and 
other persons using its facilities, and 
6(b)(5) of the Act,
16
in that it is designed 
to prevent fraudulent and manipulative 
acts and practices, to promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, to foster 
cooperation and coordination with 
persons engaged in facilitating 
transactions in securities, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanisms of a free and open market 
and a national market system and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest. 
The Commission has repeatedly 
expressed its preference for competition

over regulatory intervention in 
determining prices, products, and 
services in the securities markets. In 
Regulation NMS, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO 
revenues and, also, recognized that 
current regulation of the market system 
‘‘has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
17
 
There are currently 18 registered 
options exchanges competing for order 
flow. Based on publicly-available 
information, and excluding index-based 
options, no single exchange had more 
than approximately 10.28% of the 
multiply-listed equity options market 
share for the month of October 2025.
18
 
Therefore, no exchange possesses 
significant pricing power. More 
specifically, the Exchange had a market 
share of approximately 3.26% of 
executed volume of multiply-listed 
equity options for the month of October 
2025.
19
The Exchange believes that the 
ever-shifting market share among the 
exchanges from month to month 
demonstrates that market participants 
can discontinue or reduce use of certain 
categories of products and services, 
terminate an existing membership or 
determine to not become a new member, 
and/or shift order flow, in response to 
transaction fee changes. 
The Exchange believes its proposal to 
establish alternative Simple Maker 
rebates for options transactions in 
Penny classes and non-Penny classes in 
Tier 4 for executed Priority Customer 
orders when the contra-side is an 
Affiliated Market Maker and certain 
volume thresholds are met is 
reasonable, equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory. The Exchange believes 
the changes are reasonable because they 
may attract additional Priority Customer 
volume to the Exchange, which may, in 
turn, encourage Members to submit 
more Priority Customer orders, leading 
to increased liquidity on the Exchange 
to the benefit of all market participants 
by providing more trading opportunities 
and tighter spreads. The Exchange 
further believes the proposed changes 
are reasonable because they may 
provide an incentive for Market Makers 
to interact with more Priority Customer 
liquidity in Penny and non-Penny 
classes, thereby promoting price 
discovery and contributing to a deeper 
and more liquid market, which benefits 
all market participants and enhances the 
attractiveness of the Exchange as a 
trading venue. The Exchange also notes 
that other equity options exchanges 
provide for different pricing dependent 
upon whether the executing buyer and 
seller are the same market participant, 
have some form of common ownership, 
and/or based upon certain volume 
thresholds in different segments. 
Accordingly, the Exchange believes the 
proposal is reasonable as other 
exchanges offer similar pricing 
structures.
20
 
The Exchange believes the proposal is 
equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory because all similarly 
situated market participants in the same 
origin type are subject to the same tiered 
Maker rebates and Taker fees and access 
to the Exchange is offered on terms that 
are not unfairly discriminatory. The 
Exchange believes it is equitably 
allocated and not unfairly 
discriminatory to provide the proposed 
alternative rebates for Priority Customer 
orders when the contra-side is an 
Affiliated Market Maker and certain 
volume thresholds are met in order to 
incentivize Market Makers to increase 
their participation in all options to the 
benefit of the entire market, which may 
increase order flow sent to the 
Exchange, benefiting all market 
participants through increased 
participation, leading to tighter markets 
and order interaction. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed volume thresholds for the 
alternative Simple Maker rebates for 
options transactions in Penny classes 
and non-Penny classes in Tier 4 for 
executed Priority Customer orders when 
the contra-side is an Affiliated Market 
Maker are reasonable for business and 
competitive reasons. The Exchange 
believes the proposed volume 
thresholds are reasonable, equitably 
allocated and not unfairly 
discriminatory because the thresholds 
should encourage Members to increase 
Priority Customer liquidity and Market 
Maker order interaction, which may 
increase order flow sent to the 
Exchange, benefiting all market 
participants through increased liquidity, 
tighter markets and order interaction. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule changes will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
Intra-Market Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
any of the proposed changes will 
impose any burden on intra-market 
competition. Instead, the Exchange 
believes the proposed changes will 
promote competition because they will 
further incentivize Priority Customer 
orders to the Exchange. The Exchange 
believes that this may, in turn, 
encourage Members to submit more 
Priority Customer orders, leading to 
increased liquidity on the Exchange to 
the benefit of all market participants by 
providing more trading opportunities 
and tighter spreads. 
Inter-Market Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed changes will impose any 
burden on inter-market competition and 
the Exchange notes that it operates in a 
highly competitive market in which 
market participants can readily favor 
competing venues if they deem fee 
levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive, or rebate opportunities 
available at other venues to be more 
favorable. There are currently 18 
registered options exchanges competing 
for order flow. Based on publicly- 
available information, and excluding 
index-based options, no single exchange 
had more than approximately 10.28% of 
the multiply-listed equity options 
market share for the month of October 
2025.
21
Therefore, no exchange 
possesses significant pricing power. 
More specifically, the Exchange had a 
market share of approximately 3.26% of 
executed volume of multiply-listed 
equity options for the month of October 
2025.
22
 
In such an environment, the Exchange 
must continually adjust its rebates and 
tiers to remain competitive with other 
options exchanges. Because competitors 
are free to modify their own fees and 
tiers in response, and because market 
participants may readily adjust their 
order routing practices, the Exchange 
believes that the degree to which fee 
changes in this market may impose any 
burden on competition is extremely 
limited. The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule changes reflect this 
competitive environment because they 
modify the Exchange’s rebates in a 
manner that encourages market 
participants to continue to provide 
liquidity and to send order flow to the 
Exchange.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Nasdaq 
BX, Inc.; Notice of Filing and 
Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed 
Rule Change To Amend BX Equity 6, 
Section 4 (Exchange Sharing of 
Participant Risk Settings) To Permit 
the Allocation of Responsibility to 
Clearing Members 
December 18, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
10, 2025, Nasdaq BX, Inc. (‘‘BX’’ or 
‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’ or 
‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III, below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend BX 
Equity 6, Section 4 (Exchange Sharing of 
Participant Risk Settings) to permit the 
allocation of responsibility to clearing 
members. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/bx/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend BX 
Equity 6, Section 4 to permit the 
allocation of responsibility to clearing 
members. Specifically, the Exchange 
proposes to add a new Section 4(b) 
(Clearing Member Designation) to allow 
a Participant that does not self-clear to 
allocate responsibility for establishing 
and adjusting its risk levels to a clearing 
member that clears transactions on 
behalf of the Participant.
3
A clearing 
member guarantees transactions 
executed on the Exchange for 
Participants with whom it has entered 
into a clearing arrangement, and 
therefore bears the risk associated with 
those transactions. Because a clearing 
member bears the risk on behalf of its 
associated Participant, the Exchange 
believes that it is appropriate for the 
clearing member to have knowledge of 
what risk settings the Participant may 
utilize within the Exchange’s trading 
system, as well as the option to set and 
adjust the risk levels. Therefore, the 
Exchange proposes to make a 
Participant’s risk settings in BX Equity 
6, Section 5 available to a clearing 
member, as well as the option to set and 
adjust the risk levels, if authorized by a 
Participant. 
For clarification, the Exchange does 
not guarantee that these risk controls 
will be sufficiently comprehensive to 
meet all of a Participant’s needs, nor are 
the controls designed to be the sole 
means of risk management, and using 
these controls will not necessarily meet 
a Participant’s obligations required by 
Exchange or federal rules—including, 
without limitation, Rule 15c3–5 under 
the Act

No. SR–NASDAQ–2025–043) (Self-Regulatory 
Organizations; The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC; 
Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of 
Proposed Rule Change to Amend Equity 6, Section 
4 (Exchange Sharing of Participant Risk Settings) to 
Permit the Allocation of Responsibility to Clearing 
Members) (‘‘Nasdaq Filing’’). 
9
As adopted in the Nasdaq Filing, this Nasdaq 
rule reads as follows: ‘‘Clearing Member 
Designation. A Participant that does not self-clear 
may allocate the responsibility for establishing and 
adjusting the risk levels identified in Equity 6, 
Section 5 to a clearing member that clears 
transactions on behalf of the Participant, if 
designated in a manner prescribed by the Exchange. 
A Participant that chooses to allocate responsibility 
to its clearing member may view any risk levels 
established by the clearing member pursuant to this 
Rule, and will be notified of any action taken by 
the Exchange with respect to its trading activity. A 
Participant may revoke responsibility allocated to 
its clearing member pursuant to this paragraph at 
any time, if designated in a manner prescribed by 
the Exchange.’’ 
10
All Exchange orders pass through basic risk 
checks regardless of whether a Participant opts into 
a risk setting. 
11
15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii). 
12
17 CFR 240.19b–4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6) requires a self-regulatory organization to give 
the Commission written notice of its intent to file 
the proposed rule change at least five business days 
prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule 
change, or such shorter time as designated by the 
Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this 
requirement. 
Exchange’s risk settings in BX Equity 6, 
Section 5 will not automatically 
constitute compliance with Exchange or 
federal rules, and the responsibility for 
compliance with all Exchange and 
federal rules remains with the 
Participant.
5
 
If a Participant chooses to designate 
responsibility to a clearing member, the 
Participant may view any risk levels 
established by the clearing member 
pursuant to proposed BX Equity 6, 
Section 4(b). Even if a clearing member 
is designated, a Participant will 
continue to be notified by the Exchange 
of any action taken regarding its trading 
activity. A Participant may revoke the 
responsibility it has allocated to a 
clearing member at any time. 
The Exchange also proposes labeling 
the current rule text at BX Equity 6, 
Section 4 as BX Equity 6, Section 4(a) 
(Sharing Risk Settings). The text of this 
newly labeled provision remains 
completely unchanged. 
The Exchange will announce the 
implementation date of the change 
described in this filing in an Equity 
Trader Alert at least 30 days prior to 
implementation. At present, the 
Exchange expects that the functionality 
described in this filing will be ready for 
implementation in the first quarter of 
2026, although that time frame is subject 
to change. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
6
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
7
 
in particular, in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
As a preliminary matter, the Exchange 
notes that this proposal is not novel. 
Earlier this year The Nasdaq Stock 
Market LLC made a parallel change to 
its rulebook.
8
The language of Nasdaq 
Equity 6, Section 4(b) is substantively 
identical to the new rule text proposed 
by the Exchange in the present filing.
9
 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed amendment to BX Equity 6, 
Section 4 would provide clearing 
members, who have assumed certain 
risks of Participants, greater control over 
risk tolerance and exposure on behalf of 
their correspondent Participant, while 
helping to ensure that both the 
Participant and its clearing member are 
aware of developing issues. 
A clearing member guarantees 
transactions executed on Nasdaq for 
members with whom it has entered into 
a clearing arrangement, and therefore 
bears the risk associated with those 
transactions. The Exchange therefore 
believes that it is appropriate for a 
clearing member to have knowledge of 
what risk settings a Participant may 
utilize within the Exchange’s trading 
system, as well as the option to set and 
adjust the risk levels. The proposal will 
permit a clearing member with whom a 
Participant has entered into a clearing 
arrangement to better monitor and 
manage the potential risks assumed by 
the clearing member, thereby providing 
the clearing member with greater 
control and flexibility over setting its 
own risk tolerance and exposure and 
aiding the clearing member in 
complying with the requirements of the 
Act. 
The Exchange also believes that the 
proposed amendment will assist 
Participants and clearing members in 
managing their financial exposure 
which, in turn, could enhance the 
integrity of trading on the securities 
markets and help to ensure the stability 
of the financial system. Moreover, a 
Participant may revoke responsibility 
allocated to its clearing member at any 
time. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change does not unfairly 
discriminate among Participants 
because the use of the risk settings 
under BX Equity 6, Section 5 would be 
available to all Participants and their 
clearing members, if authorized. In 
addition, because all orders on the 
Exchange pass through the Exchange’s 
risk checks, there would be no 
difference in the latency experienced by 
Participants who have opted to use the 
risk settings versus those who have not 
opted to use them.
10
 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
proposed rule change is designed to 
provide Participants and their clearing 
members with additional means to 
monitor and control risk. The proposed 
rule may increase confidence in the 
proper functioning of the markets and 
contribute to additional competition 
among trading venues and broker- 
dealers. Rather than impede 
competition, the proposal is designed to 
facilitate more robust risk management 
by Participants and clearing members, 
which, in turn, could enhance the 
integrity of trading on the securities 
markets and help to ensure the stability 
of the financial system. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: (i) significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant 
burden on competition; and (iii) become 
operative for 30 days from the date on 
which it was filed, or such shorter time 
as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
11
and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b–4 
thereunder.
12
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if

2
17 CFR 242.602(b). 
3
Under Rule 602(b)(5), electronic 
communications networks (‘‘ECNs’’) have the 
option of reporting to an exchange or association for 
public dissemination, on behalf of customers that 
are OTC market makers or exchange market makers, 
the best-priced orders and the full size for such 
orders entered by market makers on the ECN, to 
satisfy such market makers’ reporting obligation 
under Rule 602(b). Since this reporting requirement 
is an alternative method of meeting the market 
makers’ reporting obligation, and because it is 
directed to nine or fewer persons (ECNs), this 
collection of information is not subject to OMB 
review under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
(‘‘PRA’’). 
4
For the reporting obligation under Rule 602(b), 
the respondents are exchange members and OTC 
market makers. The Commission believes that 
communication of quotations through an 
exchange’s electronic trading system effectively 
means that exchange members currently have no 
reporting burden under Rule 602(b) for these 
quotations. The Commission also believes that there 
are presently no OTC market makers that quote 
other than on an exchange. 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

the following methods:

Upon Written Request, Copies Available 
From: Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 
100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549–2736 
Notice is hereby given that, pursuant 
to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC or 
‘‘Commission’’) is soliciting comments 
on the proposed collection of 
information provided for in Rule 602 of 
Regulation NMS (17 CFR 240.602), 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.). The 
Commission plans to submit this 
existing collection of information to the 
Office of Management and Budget 
(‘‘OMB’’) for extension and approval. 
Rule 602 of Regulation NMS, 
Dissemination of Quotations in NMS 
securities, contains two related 
collections. The first collection of 
information is found in Rule 602(a).
1
 
This third-party disclosure requirement 
obligates each national securities 
exchange and national securities 
association to make available to 
quotation vendors for dissemination to 
the public the best bid, best offer, and 
aggregate quotation size for each 
‘‘subject security,’’ as defined under the 
Rule. The second collection of 
information is found in Rule 602(b).
2
 
This disclosure requirement obligates 
any exchange member and over-the- 
counter (‘‘OTC’’) market maker that is a 
‘‘responsible broker or dealer,’’ as 
defined under the Rule, to communicate 
to an exchange or association its best 
bids, best offers, and quotation sizes for 
subject securities.
3
 
It is anticipated that 30 respondents, 
consisting of 29 national securities 
exchanges and one national securities 
association, will collectively respond 
approximately 1,543,667,886,538 times 
per year pursuant to Rule 602(a) at 16.20 
microseconds per response, resulting in 
a total annual time burden of 
approximately 208,410 hours. It is 
anticipated that no respondents will 
have a reporting burden pursuant to 
Rule 602(b).
4
 
Thus, the aggregate third-party 
disclosure burden under Rule 602 is 
approximately 208,410 hours annually 
which is comprised of 208,410 hours 
relating to Rule 602(a) and 0 hours 
relating to Rule 602(b). 
An agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
Control Number. 
Written comments are invited on: (a) 
whether this proposed collection of 
information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the SEC, 
including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of 
the SEC’s estimate of the burden 
imposed by the proposed collection of 
information, including the validity of 
the methodology and the assumptions 
used; (c) ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and (d) ways to minimize 
the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including 
through the use of automated, electronic 
collection techniques or other forms of 
information technology. 
Please direct your written comments 
on this 60-Day Collection Notice to 
Austin Gerig, Director/Chief Data 
Officer, Securities and Exchange 
Commission, c/o Tanya Ruttenberg via 
email to PaperworkReductionAct@
sec.gov by February 23, 2026. There will be a second opportunity to comment on 
this SEC request following the Federal 
Register publishing a 30-Day Submission Notice.

FLEX Options are designed to meet the needs of 
market participants for greater flexibility in 
selecting the terms of options within the parameters 
of the Exchange’s rules. Options 3A Rules govern 
FLEX. 
5
The FLEX PIM is a paired auction mechanism 
pursuant to Options 3A, Section 12 through which 
an Exchange member may electronically submit for 
execution an order (which may be a simple or 
complex order) it represents as agent (‘‘Agency 
Order’’) against principal interest or a solicited 
order(s) (except, if the Agency Order is a simple 
order, for an order for the account of any FLEX 
Market Maker with an appointment in the 
applicable FLEX Option class on the Exchange) (an 
‘‘Initiating Order’’), provided it submits the Agency 
Order for electronic execution into a FLEX PIM 
Auction pursuant to Options 3A, Section 12. 
6
The FLEX SOM is a paired auction mechanism 
pursuant to Options 3A, Section 13 through which 
an Exchange member (the ‘‘Initiating Member’’) 
may electronically submit for execution an order 
(which may be a simple or complex order) it 
represents as agent (‘‘Agency Order’’) against a 
solicited order (‘‘Solicited Order’’) if it submits the 
Agency Order for electronic execution into a FLEX 
SOM Auction pursuant to Options 3A, Section 13. 
7
The term ‘‘Market Makers’’ refers to 
‘‘Competitive Market Makers’’ and ‘‘Primary Market 
Makers’’ collectively. See Options 1, Section 1(a)(21). 
8
A ‘‘Non-Nasdaq ISE Market Maker’’ is a market 
maker as defined in Section 3(a)(38) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, 
registered in the same options class on another

A ‘‘Firm Proprietary’’ order is an order 
submitted by a member for its own proprietary 
account. See Options 7, Section 1(c). 10
A ‘‘Broker-Dealer’’ order is an order submitted 
by a member for a broker-dealer account that is not 
its own proprietary account. See Options 7, Section 1(c). 
11
A ‘‘Professional Customer’’ is a person or entity 
that is not a broker/dealer and is not a Priority 
Customer. See Options 7, Section 1(c). 12
A ‘‘Priority Customer’’ is a person or entity that 
is not a broker/dealer in securities, and does not 
place more than 390 orders in listed options per day 
on average during a calendar month for its own 
beneficial account(s), as defined in Nasdaq ISE 
Options 1, Section 1(a)(38). Unless otherwise noted, 
when used in this Pricing Schedule the term 
‘‘Priority Customer’’ includes ‘‘Retail.’’ A ‘‘Retail’’ 
order is a Priority Customer order that originates 
from a natural person, provided that no change is 
made to the terms of the order with respect to price 
or side of market and the order does not originate 
from a trading algorithm or any other computerized 
methodology. See Options 7, Section 1(c). 13

12(c)(5) and Options 3A, Section 
13(c)(5), respectively. For responses to a 
FLEX PIM and FLEX SOM, today, the 
Exchange assesses $0.50 per contract for 
Market Makers, Non-Nasdaq ISE Market 
Makers (FarMM), Firm Proprietary/ 
Broker Dealers, Professional Customers, 
and Priority Customers. 
At this time, the Exchange proposes to 
decrease Non-Priority Customer Fees for 
FLEX PIM and FLEX SOM from $0.07 
to $0.06 per contract. The Exchange 
believes that this decrease will 
incentivize greater activity in FLEX PIM 
and FLEX SOM for potential price 
improvement. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
13
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
14
in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees, and other charges 
among members and issuers and other 
persons using any facility, and is not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Exchange’s proposed changes to 
its Pricing Schedule are reasonable in 
several respects. As a threshold matter, 
the Exchange is subject to significant 
competitive forces in the market for 
options securities transaction services 
that constrain its pricing determinations 
in that market. The fact that this market 
is competitive has long been recognized 
by the courts. In NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 
the D.C. Circuit stated as follows: ‘‘[n]o 
one disputes that competition for order 
flow is ‘fierce.’ . . . As the SEC 
explained, ‘[i]n the U.S. national market 
system, buyers and sellers of securities,

and the broker-dealers that act as their 
order-routing agents, have a wide range 
of choices of where to route orders for 
execution’; [and] ‘no exchange can 
afford to take its market share 
percentages for granted’ because ‘no 
exchange possesses a monopoly, 
regulatory or otherwise, in the execution 
of order flow from broker 
dealers’....’’
15
 
The Commission and the courts have 
repeatedly expressed their preference 
for competition over regulatory 
intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities 
markets. In Regulation NMS, while 
adopting a series of steps to improve the 
current market model, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO 
revenues and, also, recognized that 
current regulation of the market system 
‘‘has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
16
 
Numerous indicia demonstrate the 
competitive nature of this market. For 
example, clear substitutes to the 
Exchange exist in the market for options 
security transaction services. The 
Exchange is only one of eighteen 
options exchanges to which market 
participants may direct their order flow. 
Within this environment, market 
participants can freely and often do shift 
their order flow among the Exchange 
and competing venues in response to 
changes in their respective pricing 
schedules. As such, the proposal 
represents a reasonable attempt by the 
Exchange to increase its liquidity and 
market share relative to its competitors. 
FLEX Order Fees 
The Exchange’s proposal to decrease 
Non-Priority Customer Fees for FLEX 
PIM and FLEX SOM from $0.07 to $0.06 
per contract is reasonable because the 
fee reduction will incentivize greater 
activity in FLEX PIM and FLEX SOM for 
potential price improvement. Further, as 
proposed, the fees are competitive with 
market dynamics and consider the price 
improvement opportunities of the order 
mechanisms. Priority Customers will 
continue to be assessed no Fee for FLEX 
PIM and FLEX SOM. 
The Exchange’s proposal to decrease 
Non-Priority Customer Fees for FLEX 
PIM and FLEX SOM from $0.07 to $0.06 
per contract is equitable and not 
unfairly discriminatory. The Fees for 
FLEX PIM and SOM will apply in a like 
manner to all Non-Priority Customers. 
Priority Customers will continue to be 
assessed no Fees for FLEX PIM and 
FLEX SOM. The Exchange believes that 
it is equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory to assess more favorable 
pricing for Priority Customers. Priority 
Customer order flow enhances liquidity 
on the Exchange to the benefit of all 
market participants by providing more 
trading opportunities, which in turn 
attracts Market Makers and other market 
participants who may interact with this 
order flow. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. In terms of 
intra-market competition, the Exchange 
does not believe that its proposal will 
place any category of market participant 
at a competitive disadvantage. 
FLEX Order Fees 
The proposed Fees for FLEX PIM and 
FLEX SOM do not impose an undue 
burden on competition because the 
Exchange will apply the same fees to all 
Non-Priority Customers. Priority 
Customers will continue to be assessed 
no Fees for FLEX PIM and FLEX SOM. 
The Exchange believes that it does not 
impose an undue burden on 
competition to assess more favorable 
pricing for Priority Customers. Priority 
Customer order flow enhances liquidity 
on the Exchange to the benefit of all 
market participants by providing more 
trading opportunities, which in turn 
attracts Market Makers and other market 
participants who may interact with this 
order flow. Nasdaq does not believe that 
the proposed fee changes place an 
unnecessary burden on competition. 
In terms of inter-market competition, 
the Exchange notes that it operates in a 
highly competitive market in which 
market participants can readily favor 
competing venues if they deem fee 
levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive, or rebate opportunities 
available at other venues to be more 
favorable. In such an environment, the 
Exchange must continually adjust its 
fees to remain competitive with other 
exchanges. Because competitors are free 
to modify their own fees in response, 
and because market participants may 
readily adjust their order routing 
practices, the Exchange believes that the 
degree to which fee changes in this 
market may impose any burden on 
competition is extremely limited. In 
sum, if the changes proposed herein are 
unattractive to market participants, it is 
likely that the Exchange will lose 
market share as a result. Accordingly, 
the Exchange does not believe that the 
proposed changes will impair the ability 
of members or competing order 
execution venues to maintain their 
competitive standing in the financial 
markets. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act.
17
At any time 
within 60 days of the filing of the 
proposed rule change, the Commission 
summarily may temporarily suspend 
such rule change if it appears to the 
Commission that such action is: (i) 
necessary or appropriate in the public 
interest; (ii) for the protection of 
investors; or (iii) otherwise in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
If the Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved.

See 17 CFR 242.600(b)(93). The ‘‘Evaluation Period,’’ as defined in Rule 600(b)(93)(iii) of

business day of May and (ii) all trading days in 
September for the round lot assigned on the first 
business day of November, during which the 
average closing price of an NMS stock on the 
primary listing exchange shall be measured by the 
primary listing exchange to determine the round lot 
for each NMS stock. Under Rule 600(b)(93)(iv), the 
round lot assigned is operative on (i) the first 
business day of May for the March Evaluation 
Period and continues through the last business day 
of October for the calendar year and (ii) the first 
business day of November for the September 
Evaluation Period and continues through the last 
business day of April of the next calendar year. 
Under Rule 600(b)(93)(ii), any security that becomes 
an NMS stock during an operative period is 
assigned a round lot of 100 shares. 
9
The new definition of ‘‘round lot’’ in Rule 
600(b)(93) of Regulation NMS applies only to NMS 
stocks. The proposed conforming changes to FINRA 
rules are similarly limited to NMS stocks and do 
not affect the normal unit of trading as it may be 
applied to any other type of security.

4
The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
FINRA is proposing to amend FINRA 
Rules 5220, 5320, 6220, 6272, 6279, 
6320A, 6320B, and 7620A to conform to 
the new definition of ‘‘round lot’’ 
adopted by the Commission under 
Regulation NMS. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on FINRA’s website at 
http://www.finra.org and at the principal office of FINRA. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, 
FINRA included statements concerning 
the purpose of and basis for the 
proposed rule change and discussed any 
comments it received on the proposed 
rule change. The text of these statements 
may be examined at the places specified 
in Item IV below. FINRA has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, 
and C below, of the most significant 
aspects of such statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
Background 
In 2020, the Commission adopted 
amendments to Regulation NMS to 
modernize the information provided 
within the national market system for 
NMS stocks.
5
Prior to the MDI Rule 
amendments to Regulation NMS, 
‘‘round lot’’ was not defined in the 
Exchange Act or SEC rules. Instead, 
exchange rules typically defined a 
round lot as 100 shares, but also 
allowed the exchange, or the primary 
listing exchange for the security, 
discretion to define it otherwise.
6
 
Among other things, the MDI Rule 
amended Rule 600(b) of Regulation 
NMS to add a new definition of ‘‘round 
lot’’ that assigns each NMS stock a 
round lot size based on the stock’s 
average closing price. In light of delays 
in the implementation of the MDI Rule, 
including the new definition of ‘‘round 
lot,’’ on September 18, 2024, the 
Commission adopted further 
amendments to Regulation NMS that, 
among other things, revised and 
accelerated the implementation of the 
new round lot definition under Rule 
600(b)(93) to implement the new round 
lot definition on November 3, 2025, the 
first business day of November 2025.
7
 
As adopted under the 2024 NMS 
Amendments, the new definition of 
‘‘round lot’’ in Rule 600(b)(93) of 
Regulation NMS assigns each NMS 
stock a round lot size based on the 
stock’s average closing price on the 
primary listing exchange during the 
prior Evaluation Period, ranging from 
100 shares for NMS stocks priced 
$250.00 or less to one share for NMS 
stocks priced $10,000.01 or more.
8
 
Several FINRA rules use the term 
‘‘normal unit of trading’’ as the 
equivalent to the term ‘‘round lot’’ as 
used in exchange rules. As described in 
greater detail below, FINRA is 
proposing to amend these rules to 
conform to the new definition of ‘‘round 
lot’’ for NMS stocks under Regulation 
NMS.
9
 
Conforming Changes to FINRA Rules 
FINRA Rule 5220 (Offers at Stated 
Prices) provides that no member shall 
make an offer to buy from or sell to any 
person any security at a stated price 
unless such member is prepared to 
purchase or sell, as the case may be, at 
such price and under such conditions as 
are stated at the time of such offer to 
buy or sell. Supplementary Material .01 
to Rule 5220 (Firmness of Quotations) 
discusses the expectations for making a 
‘‘firm trading market’’ in a security,

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60202 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Notices 10
FINRA Rule 6272 (Character of Quotations) 
includes a duplicative definition of ‘‘normal unit of 
trading.’’ See Rule 6272(a)(1). For clarity, the proposed rule change would delete the definition 
in Rule 6272, as the definitions in Rule 6220 apply 
to the entirety of the Rule 6200 Series. Similarly, 
FINRA 6279 (Alternative Trading Systems) 
prohibits the provision of a reserved-size function 
unless the size of the order displayed through the 
ADF is ‘‘100 shares or greater.’’ The proposed rule 
change would amend Rule 6279 to prohibit a 
reserved-size function unless the size of the order 
displayed through the ADF is a normal unit of 
trading or greater.

noting that a member ‘‘is expected at 
least to buy or sell a normal unit of 
trading in the quoted stock at its then 
prevailing quotations unless clearly 
designated as not firm or firm for less 
than a normal unit of trading when 
supplied by the member.’’ The proposed 
rule change would add a new sentence 
to Supplementary Material .01 to Rule 
5220 to clarify that for purposes of Rule 
5220, a ‘‘normal unit of trading’’ for an 
NMS stock means the ‘‘round lot’’ 
assigned to such NMS stock pursuant to 
Rule 600(b) of SEC Regulation NMS. 
FINRA Rule 5320 (Prohibition Against 
Trading Ahead of Customer Orders) 
provides that, except as provided in 
Rule 5320, a member that accepts and 
holds an order in an equity security 
from its own customer or a customer of 
another broker-dealer without 
immediately executing the order is 
prohibited from trading that security on 
the same side of the market for its own 
account at a price that would satisfy the 
customer order, unless it immediately 
thereafter executes the customer order 
up to the size and at the same or better 
price at which it traded for its own 
account. Among other things, 
Supplementary Material .05 to Rule 
5320 (Odd Lot and Bona Fide Error 
Transaction Exceptions) provides an 
exception from these obligations for a 
member’s proprietary trade that is ‘‘to 
offset a customer order that is in an 
amount less than a normal unit of 
trading[.]’’ The proposed rule change 
would add a new sentence to 
Supplementary Material .05 to Rule 
5320 to clarify that, for purposes of Rule 
5320, a ‘‘normal unit of trading’’ for an 
NMS stock means the ‘‘round lot’’ 
assigned to such NMS stock pursuant to 
Rule 600(b) of SEC Regulation NMS. 
The FINRA Rule 6200 Series 
(Alternative Display Facility) sets forth 
rules governing the operation of the 
FINRA Alternative Display Facility 
(‘‘ADF’’), which provides members with 
a facility for the display of quotations, 
the reporting of trades, and the 
comparison of trades in NMS stocks. 
FINRA Rule 6220 (Definitions) defines 
specified terms used in the ADF rules, 
including to define a ‘‘normal unit of 
trading’’ to mean ‘‘100 shares of a 
security unless, with respect to a 
particular security, the market where 
the security is listed determines that a 
normal unit of trading shall constitute 
other than 100 shares.’’ The proposed 
rule change would amend the definition 
of ‘‘normal unit of trading’’ in Rule 6220 
to mean the ‘‘round lot’’ assigned to a 
security pursuant to Rule 600(b) of SEC 
Regulation NMS.
10
 
The FINRA Rule 6300 Series (Trade 
Reporting Facilities) sets forth the rules 
governing the operation of the FINRA/ 
Nasdaq Trade Reporting Facilities and 
the FINRA/NYSE Trade Reporting 
Facility (collectively, the ‘‘TRFs’’), 
which provide members with a 
mechanism for the reporting of 
transactions in NMS stocks effected 
otherwise than on an exchange. FINRA 
Rules 6320(A) (Definitions) and 6320(B) 
(Definitions) define specified terms used 
in the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF and FINRA/ 
NYSE TRF rules, respectively, including 
‘‘normal unit of trading,’’ which means 
‘‘100 shares of a security unless, with 
respect to a particular security, FINRA 
determines that a normal unit of trading 
shall constitute other than 100 shares.’’ 
The proposed rule change would amend 
the definitions of ‘‘normal unit of 
trading’’ in both Rule 6320(A) and Rule 
6320(B) to mean the ‘‘round lot’’ 
assigned to a security pursuant to Rule 
600(b) of SEC Regulation NMS. 
FINRA Rule 7620A (FINRA/Nasdaq 
Trade Reporting Facility Reporting Fees) 
sets forth the charges to be paid by 
participants for use of the FINRA/ 
Nasdaq TRFs. Under Rule 7620A, 
participants must complete attestations 
to qualify for the ATS Market Maker 
Media/Contra Party Cap and the ATS 
Market Maker Combined Media Activity 
Cap. Both attestations include a 
statement that the participant will 
‘‘display a quotation size of at least one 
normal unit of trading (specific for each 
security)’’ in each symbol traded on an 
alternative trading system registered 
pursuant to Regulation ATS. The 
proposed rule change would add a new 
sentence to Supplementary Material .01 
to Rule 7620A, which sets forth the 
definitions of specified terms used in 
the rule, to clarify that for purposes of 
Rule 7620A, a ‘‘normal unit of trading’’ 
means the ‘‘round lot’’ assigned to a 
security pursuant to Rule 600(b) of SEC 
Regulation NMS. 
FINRA has filed the proposed rule 
change for immediate effectiveness and 
has requested that the SEC waive the 
requirement that the proposed rule 
change not become operative for 30 days 
after the date of the filing, so FINRA can 
implement the proposed rule change 
immediately. 
2. Statutory Basis 
FINRA believes that the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the provisions 
of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act,
11
which 
requires, among other things, that 
FINRA rules be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and national market system, and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest, and Section 15A(b)(11) 
of the Act,
12
which requires among 
other things that FINRA rules include 
provisions governing the form and 
content of quotations relating to 
securities sold otherwise than on a 
national securities exchange which may 
be distributed or published by any 
member or person associated with a 
member, and the persons to whom such 
quotations may be supplied. FINRA 
believes the proposed rule change will 
reduce confusion and provide greater 
clarity to members and the public by 
conforming the term ‘‘normal unit of 
trading’’ as used in FINRA rules with 
respect to NMS stocks to the new 
definition of ‘‘round lot’’ as adopted by 
the Commission in Regulation NMS. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
FINRA does not believe that the 
proposed rule change will result in any 
burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
proposed rule change conforms FINRA 
rules to requirements established under 
Regulation NMS. 
Economic Impact Assessment 
FINRA has undertaken an economic 
impact assessment, as set forth below, to 
analyze the potential economic impacts 
of the proposed rule change, including 
anticipated costs, benefits, and 
distributional and competitive effects, 
relative to current baseline. 
Regulatory Need 
The proposed rule change would 
conform FINRA rules with amendments 
to the definition of ‘‘round lot’’ under 
Rule 600(b)(93) of Regulation NMS, 
minimizing potential confusion and 
helping industry participants

description and text of the proposed rule change, 
at least five business days prior to the date of filing 
of the proposed rule change, or such shorter time 
as designated by the Commission. FINRA has 
satisfied this requirement.

See supra note 7.

For purposes only of waiving the 30-day 
operative delay, the Commission has also 
considered the proposed rule’s impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See

implement the SEC’s new definition of 
‘‘round lot.’’ 
Economic Baseline 
The economic baseline for the 
proposed rule change consists of current 
FINRA Rules 5220, 5320, 6220, 6272, 
6279, 6320A, 6320B, and 7620A, as well 
as the amendments to Rule 600 of 
Regulation NMS adopted by the SEC. 
Economic Impacts 
The proposed changes to FINRA rules 
conform the term ‘‘normal unit of 
trading’’ as used in FINRA rules with 
respect to NMS stocks to the new 
definition of ‘‘round lot’’ as adopted by 
the SEC in Regulation NMS. The 
proposed changes do not impose any 
burdens on industry beyond those that 
industry must incur to implement the 
SEC’s final rules pertaining to the new 
definition. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
Written comments were neither 
solicited nor received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
FINRA has filed the proposed rule 
change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
13
and Rule 
19b–4(f)(6) thereunder.
14
Because the 
proposed rule change does not: (i) 
significantly affect the protection of 
investors or the public interest; (ii) 
impose any significant burden on 
competition; and (iii) become operative 
prior to 30 days from the date on which 
it was filed, or such shorter time as the 
Commission may designate, if 
consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest, the 
proposed rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) 
of the Act
15
and Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii) 
thereunder.
16
 
A proposed rule change filed under 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
17
normally does not 
become operative prior to 30 days after 
the date of the filing. However, pursuant 
to Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii),
18
the 
Commission may designate a shorter 
time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public 
interest. FINRA has asked the 
Commission to waive the 30-day 
operative delay so that FINRA can 
implement the proposed rule change 
immediately and conform its rules with 
current federal securities laws and 
regulations, particularly Rule 600(b)(93) 
of Regulation NMS, which took effect in 
November 2025.
19
For these reasons, 
and because the proposed rule change 
does not raise any new or novel 
regulatory issues, the Commission finds 
that waiving the 30-day operative delay 
is consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest. 
Accordingly, the Commission hereby 
waives the 30-day operative delay and 
designates the proposed rule change as 
operative upon filing.
20
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
under Section 19(b)(2)(B)
21
of the Act to 
determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the

and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
8, 2025, Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the 
‘‘Exchange’’ or ‘‘BZX’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I and II 
below, which Items have been prepared 
by the Exchange. The Exchange filed the 
proposal as a ‘‘non-controversial’’ 
proposed rule change pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
3
and 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6) thereunder.
4
The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (‘‘BZX’’ or 
the ‘‘Exchange’’) is filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’ or ‘‘SEC’’) a proposed 
rule change to amend the WisdomTree 
Bitcoin Fund (the ‘‘Fund’’), shares (’’ 
Fund Shares’’) of which have been 
approved by the Commission to list and 
trade on the Exchange pursuant to BZX 
Rule 14.11(e)(4) under an approval 
order, to permit the Fund to list and 
trade under the generic listing standards 
of that rule. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is also available on the Commission’s 
website (https://www.sec.gov/rules/ 
sro.shtml), the Exchange’s website 
(https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/ 
regulation/rule_filings/bzx/), and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Commission has previously 
approved the listing and trading of 
shares for the Fund under Rule 
14.11(e)(4),
5
and the Fund currently 
lists and trades on the Exchange. The 
Exchange now proposes to transition 
this Fund to operate under the recently 
Commission-approved generic listing 
standards for Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares pursuant to Rule 14.11(e)(4) 
(‘‘Amended Rule 14.11(e)(4)’’).
6
The 
Fund will meet the requirements of 
Amended Rule 14.11(e)(4) and will be 
required to comply with the continued 
listing requirements set forth in such 
Rule. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the Act 
and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
7
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5)
8
requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and

4(f)(6)(iii) requires the Exchange to give the 
Commission written notice of its intent to file the 
proposed rule change, along with a brief description 
and text of the proposed rule change, at least five 
business days prior to the date of filing of the 
proposed rule change, or such shorter time as 
designated by the Commission. The Exchange has

practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged 
in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, 
and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
9
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is designed to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and, in general, to protect investors and 
the public interest because it would 
provide for the transition of the Fund 
from being listed pursuant to the Bitcoin 
ETP Approval Order to Amended Rule 
14.11(e)(4) instead. The proposed 
change would allow the Fund Shares to 
continue listing and trading on the 
Exchange and permit the Fund to 
operate in reliance on the generic listing 
standards in Amended Rule 14.11(e)(4) 
instead of the terms of the Bitcoin ETP 
Approval Order, thereby facilitating the 
continued listing and trading of 
exchange-traded products that will 
enhance competition among market 
participants, to the benefit of investors 
and the marketplace. The Fund will 
meet the requirements of Amended Rule 
14.11(e)(4) and will be required to 
comply with the continued listing 
standards set forth in Amended Rule 
14.11(e)(4). 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purpose of the Act. As discussed 
above, the proposed change is intended 
to facilitate the continued listing and 
trading of the Fund on the Exchange, 
thereby promoting competition among 
exchange-traded products to the benefit 
of investors and the marketplace. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received comments on the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The Exchange has filed the proposed 
rule change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act
10
and Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6)
11
thereunder. Because the 
foregoing proposed rule change does 
not: (i) significantly affect the protection 
of investors or the public interest; (ii) 
impose any significant burden on 
competition; or (iii) become operative 
for 30 days from the date on which it 
was filed, or such shorter time as the 
Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act
12
and Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6)
13
thereunder. 
A proposed rule change filed under 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
14
normally does not 
become operative prior to 30 days after 
the date of the filing. However, pursuant 
to Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii),
15
the 
Commission may designate a shorter 
time if such action is consistent with 
protection of investors and the public 
interest. The Exchange has asked the 
Commission to waive the 30-day 
operative delay so that the proposed 
rule change may become operative 
immediately upon filing. The 
Commission believes that waiving the 
30-day operative delay is consistent 
with the protection of investors and the 
public interest because it will allow the 
Exchange to implement the proposed 
rule change without delay and does not 
introduce any novel regulatory issues. 
Accordingly, the Commission 
designates the proposed rule change to 
be operative upon filing.
16
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act. 
Comments may be submitted by any of 
the following methods: 
Electronic Comments 
€Use the Commission’s internet comment form (https://www.sec.gov/ 
rules/sro.shtml); or

Price List applicable to D Orders that 
execute in the close. The Exchange 
proposes to implement the fee change 
effective December 5, 2025. 
Background 
Current Market and Competitive 
Environment 
The Exchange operates in a highly 
competitive market. The Commission 
has repeatedly expressed its preference 
for competition over regulatory 
intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities 
markets. In Regulation NMS, the 
Commission highlighted the importance 
of market forces in determining prices 
and SRO revenues and, also, recognized 
that current regulation of the market 
system ‘‘has been remarkably successful 
in promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
3
 
While Regulation NMS has enhanced 
competition, it has also fostered a 
‘‘fragmented’’ market structure where 
trading in a single stock can occur 
across multiple trading centers. When 
multiple trading centers compete for 
order flow in the same stock, the 
Commission has recognized that ‘‘such 
competition can lead to the 
fragmentation of order flow in that 
stock.’’
4
Indeed, cash equity trading is 
currently dispersed across 16 
exchanges,
5
numerous alternative 
trading systems,
6
and broker-dealer 
internalizers and wholesalers, all 
competing for order flow. Based on 
publicly-available information, no 
single exchange currently has more than 
20% market share.
7
Therefore, no 
exchange possesses significant pricing 
power in the execution of cash equity 
order flow. More specifically, the 
Exchange’s share of executed volume of 
equity trades in Tapes A, B and C 
securities is less than 12%.
8
 
The Exchange believes that the ever- 
shifting market share among the 
exchanges from month to month 
demonstrates that market participants 
can move order flow, or discontinue or 
reduce use of certain categories of 
products. While it is not possible to 
know a firm’s reason for shifting order 
flow, the Exchange believes that one 
such reason is because of fee changes at 
any of the registered exchanges or non- 
exchange venues to which the firm 
routes order flow. Accordingly, 
competitive forces compel the Exchange 
to use exchange transaction fees and 
credits because market participants can 
readily trade on competing venues if 
they deem pricing levels at those other 
venues to be more favorable. 
The proposed change responds to the 
current competitive environment where 
order flow providers have a choice of 
where to direct liquidity-providing 
orders and closing price orders by 
encouraging all member organizations to 
enter or modify D Orders as early 
possible, which the Exchange believes 
promotes efficient use of Exchange 
systems in the best interests of member 
organizations and investors accessing 
the Exchange. 
Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange currently offers fees 
differentiated by time of entry (or last 
modification) for D Orders at the close 
after the first 10,500,000 ADV of the 
aggregate executions at the close by a 
member organization. Footnote 10 of the 
Price List defines ‘‘last modified’’ in this 
connection as follows: 
As used herein, ‘‘last modified’’ 
means the later of the order’s entry time 
or the final modification or cancellation 
time for any D Order designated for the 
close with the same broker badge, 
entering firm mnemonic, symbol, and 
side. 
The Exchange proposes to amend this 
definition to provide that ‘‘last 
modified’’ would mean the later of the 
order’s entry time or the final 
modification for a D Order designated 
for the close. As proposed, the 
definition would read as follows: 
As used herein, ‘‘last modified’’ 
means the later of the order’s entry time 
or the final modification for a D Order 
designated for the close. 
The Exchange is not proposing any 
changes to the current fees. 
The proposed changes are not 
otherwise intended to address any other 
issues, and the Exchange is not aware of 
any problems that member 
organizations would have in complying 
with the proposed change. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change is consistent with

The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
Section 6(b) of the Act,
11
in general, and 
furthers the objectives of Sections 
6(b)(4) and (5) of the Act,
12
in particular, 
because it provides for the equitable 
allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and 
other charges among its members, 
issuers and other persons using its 
facilities and does not unfairly 
discriminate between customers, 
issuers, brokers or dealers. 
As discussed above, the Exchange 
operates in a highly competitive market. 
The Commission has repeatedly 
expressed its preference for competition 
over regulatory intervention in 
determining prices, products, and 
services in the securities markets. In 
Regulation NMS, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO 
revenues and, also, recognized that 
current regulation of the market system 
‘‘has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
13
 
While Regulation NMS has enhanced 
competition, it has also fostered a 
‘‘fragmented’’ market structure where 
trading in a single stock can occur 
across multiple trading centers. When 
multiple trading centers compete for 
order flow in the same stock, the 
Commission has recognized that ‘‘such 
competition can lead to the 
fragmentation of order flow in that 
stock.’’
14
 
The Proposed Change Is Reasonable 
The proposed changes to the 
definition of ‘‘last modified’’ are 
reasonable. Specifically, the Exchange 
believes that removing order 
cancellations and the restriction to D 
Orders with the same broker badge, 
entering firm mnemonic, symbol, and 
side would result in more D Orders 
moving to the Early and Mid D Orders 
buckets in the Price List, i.e., D Orders last modified earlier than 10 minutes 
before, and from 10 minutes up to but 
not including 1 minute before, the 
scheduled close of trading, respectively, 
rather than the Late D Order bucket, i.e., 
D Orders last modified in the last 1 
minute before the scheduled close of 
trading. As a result, the Exchange 
believes that the proposed rule change 
constitutes a reasonable effort to further 
encourage all member organizations to 
enter D Orders as early possible in order 
to build up liquidity going into the 
closing auction, and to modify D Orders 
as early as possible in order to achieve 
lower fees for modifying the order type. 
The Proposal Is an Equitable Allocation 
of Fees 
The Exchange believes the proposal 
equitably allocates fees and credits 
among market participants because all 
member organizations that participate 
on the Exchange may qualify for lower 
fees on an equal basis if the member 
organization enters or modifies D Orders 
as early possible. The proposal neither 
targets nor will it have a disparate 
impact on any particular category of 
market participant. All member 
organizations that provide liquidity at 
the Exchange close would be eligible for 
lower fees if they enter or modify D 
Orders as early as possible. The 
Exchange also believes the proposal 
equitably allocates its fees and credits 
among its market participants because 
the proposed change would encourage 
greater marketable and other liquidity at 
the closing auction, which helps to 
maintain the quality of the Exchange’s 
closing auctions for the benefit of all 
market participants. Member 
organizations derive a substantial 
benefit from the higher volume of 
closing executions. 
The Proposal Is Not Unfairly 
Discriminatory 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposal is not unfairly discriminatory. 
In the prevailing competitive 
environment, member organizations are 
free to disfavor the Exchange’s pricing if 
they believe that alternatives offer them 
better value. 
The proposal does not permit unfair 
discrimination because the proposed 
criteria would be applied to all similarly 
situated member organizations, who 
would all be eligible for the same lower 
fees on an equal and non-discriminatory 
basis. The Exchange also believes that 
the proposal is not unfairly 
discriminatory because the proposed 
changes would equally encourage all 
member organizations to provide greater 
marketable and other liquidity at the 
closing auction. Finally, the submission 
of orders to the Exchange is optional for 
member organizations in that they could 
choose whether to submit orders to the 
Exchange and, if they do, the extent of 
its activity in this regard. 
For the foregoing reasons, the 
Exchange believes that the proposal is 
consistent with the Act. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
In accordance with Section 6(b)(8) of 
the Act,
15
the Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change would not impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. Instead, as 
discussed above, the Exchange believes 
that the proposed changes would 
encourage the submission of additional 
liquidity to a public exchange, thereby 
promoting market depth, price 
discovery and transparency and 
enhancing order execution 
opportunities for member organizations. 
As a result, the Exchange believes that 
the proposed change furthers the 
Commission’s goal in adopting 
Regulation NMS of fostering integrated 
competition among orders, which 
promotes ‘‘more efficient pricing of 
individual stocks for all types of orders, 
large and small.’’
16
 
Intramarket Competition. The 
proposed change is designed to attract 
additional order flow to the Exchange. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed changes would continue to 
incentivize market participants to direct 
order flow to the Exchange. Greater 
liquidity benefits all market participants 
on the Exchange by providing more 
trading opportunities and encourages 
member organizations to send orders, 
thereby contributing to robust levels of 
liquidity, which benefits all market 
participants on the Exchange. Lower 
fees for entering or modifying D Orders 
would be available to all similarly- 
situated market participants, and, as 
such, the proposed change would not 
impose a disparate burden on 
competition among market participants 
on the Exchange. As noted, the proposal 
would apply to all similarly situated 
member organizations on the same and 
equal terms, who would benefit from 
the changes on the same basis. 
Accordingly, the proposed change 
would not impose a disparate burden on 
competition among market participants 
on the Exchange.

The Exchange notes that its affiliate options 
exchanges, MIAX PEARL, LLC (‘‘MIAX Pearl’’) and 
MIAX Sapphire, LLC (‘‘MIAX Sapphire’’), 
submitted (or will submit) substantively similar 
proposals. The Exchange notes that the rules of 
Chapter IV of MIAX, including Exchange Rule 402, 
are incorporated by reference into the MIAX 
Emerald, LLC (‘‘MIAX Emerald’’) rulebook. 
Intermarket Competition. The 
Exchange operates in a highly 
competitive market in which market 
participants can readily choose to send 
their orders to other exchange and off- 
exchange venues if they deem fee levels 
at those other venues to be more 
favorable. In such an environment, the 
Exchange must continually adjust its 
fees and rebates to remain competitive 
with other exchanges and with off- 
exchange venues. Because competitors 
are free to modify their own fees and 
credits in response, and because market 
participants may readily adjust their 
order routing practices, the Exchange 
does not believe its proposed fee change 
can impose any burden on intermarket 
competition.

thereunder,
2
notice is hereby given that 
on December 4, 2025, Miami 
International Securities Exchange, LLC 
(‘‘MIAX’’ or ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’) a proposed rule change 
as described in Items I and II below, 
which Items have been prepared by the 
Exchange. The Commission is 
publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change 
from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Exchange Rule 402, Criteria for 
Underlying Securities, to permit options 
on Commodity-Based Trust Shares. 
Specifically, the Exchange proposes to 
amend the rule to (1) redefine 
Commodity-Based Trust; (2) require 
additional qualifying criteria, based on 
the criteria outlined by the primary 
listing market to list options on a 
Commodity-Based Trust; and (3) require 
that the crypto asset held by the 
Commodity-Based Trust have a 
comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement. This filing also defines a 
crypto asset. Additionally, this filing 
proposes to amend Exchange Rule 
403(g) to update the relevant citations to 
Exchange Rule 402, which are revised 
pursuant to this filing. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://www.miaxglobal.com/markets/ 
us-options/all-options-exchanges/rule- 
filings and at MIAX’s principal office. II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s

For example, a multi-coin ETF would not be 
subject to Exchange Rule 402(i)(6). For purposes of 
this rule the term ‘‘crypto asset’’ means an asset that 
is generated, issued and/or transferred using a 
blockchain or similar distributive ledger technology 
network, including but not limited to, assets known 
as ‘‘tokens,’’ ‘‘digital assets,’’ ‘‘virtual currencies,’’ 
and ‘‘coins’’ and that relies on cryptographic 
protocols. See definition at proposed Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(iii).

NASDAQ–2025–056; SR–CboeBZX–2025–104; SR– 
NYSEARCA–2025–54) (‘‘Generic Listing Standards

Exchange believes that it is appropriate to rely on 
the generic listing standards outlined by the 
primary listing market due to the potential 
proliferation of new primary listing markets and the 
Commission’s acknowledgment that the definition 
of shares of a Commodity-Based Trust across those 
primary listing markets is substantially identical.

Shares of the applicable Commodity-Based 
Trust trade as equity securities. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 50603 (Oct. 28, 2004), 69

Commodity-Based Trust Shares are included within 
the definition of a ‘‘security’’ as such term is used 
in the Exchanges’ rules and are subject to the 
Exchanges’ existing rules governing the trading of

13
The Exchange proposes to renumber current 
Exchange Rules 402(i)(5)(i) and 402(i)(5)(ii) to 
Exchange Rules 402(i)(6)(i) and 402(i)(6)(ii) for ease 
Continued 
competitive filing substantively 
identical to the proposal submitted by 
Nasdaq ISE, LLC (‘‘ISE’’) to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ‘‘Commission’’), which was 
recently deemed approved.

The Exchange initially filed SR– 
MIAX–2025–07, as Modified by Partial 
Amendment No. 1, a proposed rule 
change to amend its listing rules at 
Exchange Rule 402, Criteria for 
Underlying Securities, to allow the 
listing and trading of options on 
interests in a Commodity-Based Trust 
on March 5, 2025, which was published 
in the Federal Registrar [sic] on March 
19, 2025.
5
On April 25, 2025, the 
Commission issued a notice designating 
a longer period for Commission action, 
which designated June 17, 2025, as the 
date by which the Commission shall 
either approve or disapprove, or 
institute proceedings to determine 
whether to disapprove the filing.
6
On 
June 17, 2025, the Commission issued 
an order instituting proceedings to 
determine whether to approve or 
disapprove the filing.
7
The Commission 
did not receive any comments on the 
proposed rule change. On September 8, 
2025, the Commission extended the 
time period for approving or 
disapproving the proposed rule changes, 
as modified by the applicable Partial 
Amendments, for an additional 60 days, 
designating November 14, 2025 as the 
date by which the Commission will 
either approve or disapprove the 
proposed rule change, as modified by 
the applicable Partial Amendments.
8
 
The Commission did not act to either 
approve or disapprove the proposal on 
or before November 14, 2025, therefore 
the proposal, as published in the 
Federal Register on March 5, 2025, was 
deemed approved as of November 14, 
2025.
9
On November 6, 2025, during the 
government shutdown, the Exchange 
submitted Amendment 2 to SR–MIAX– 
2025–07. The Exchange is now 
proposing the current change to reiterate 
the changes proposed in Amendment 2 
to SR–MIAX–2025–07 to codify the 
proposed rule text in the Exchange’s 
Rulebook. 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Rule 402 to adopt new listing criteria in 
subparagraph (i)(6) to permit the listing 
and trading of options on a Commodity- 
Based Trust that meets the generic 
listing standards for Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares of the applicable primary 
listing market, except that the 
Commodity-Based Trust holds a single 
crypto asset.
10
 
On September 17, 2025, the 
Commission approved proposals by The 
Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, Cboe BZX 
Exchange, Inc. and NYSE Arca, Inc., to 
Adopt Generic Listing Standards for 
Commodity-Based Trusts.
11
In the 
approval order, the Commission noted 
that each of the exchanges proposed to 
adopt substantially identical ‘‘generic’’ 
listing standards for Commodity-Based 
Trusts. Those generic listing standards 
define the term shares of a ‘‘Commodity- 
Based Trust’’ as a security
12
that: 
(1) is issued by a trust, limited liability 
company, partnership, or other similar entity 
(‘‘Trust’’) that, if applicable, is operated by a 
registered commodity pool operator pursuant 
to the Commodity Exchange Act (‘‘CEA’’), 
and is not registered as an investment 
company pursuant to the Investment 
Company Act of 1940, or series or class 
thereof; 
(2) is designed to reflect the performance 
of one or more reference assets or an index 
of reference assets; 
(3) in order to reflect the performance, is 
issued by a Trust that holds (a) one or more 
commodities or commodity-based assets, and 
(b) in addition to such commodities or 
commodity-based assets, may hold securities, 
cash, and cash equivalents; 
(4) is issued by such Trust in a specified 
aggregate minimum number in return for a 
deposit of (a) a specified quantity of the 
underlying commodities, commodity-based 
assets, securities, cash, and/or cash 
equivalents or (b) a cash amount with a value 
based on the next determined net asset value 
per Trust share; and 
(5) when aggregated in the same specified 
minimum number, may be redeemed at a 
holder’s request by such Trust which will 
deliver to the redeeming holder (a) the 
specified quantity of the underlying 
commodities, commodity-based assets, 
securities, cash, and/or cash equivalents or 
(b) a cash amount with a value based on the 
next determined net asset value per Trust 
share. 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Exchange Rule 402(i) to create a new 
subparagraph (6)(iii) that states,

Rulebook. 
14
Exchange Rule 402(a) provides that a security 
(which includes an ETF) on which options may be 
listed and traded on the Exchange must be a 
security registered (with the Commission) and be an 
NMS stock (as defined in Rule 600 of Regulation 
NMS under the Act), and the security shall be 
characterized by a substantial number of 
outstanding shares that are widely held and actively 
traded. 
15
Exchange Rule 402(b) provides criteria and 
guidelines when evaluating potential underlying 
securities for the listing of options. 
16
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(i)(B) provides that the 
Exchange-Traded Fund Shares are available for 
creation or redemption each business day from or 
through the issuing trust, investment company, 
commodity pool or other entity in cash or in kind 
at a price related to net asset value, and the issuer 
is obligated to issue Exchange-Traded Fund Shares 
in a specified aggregate number even if some or all 
of the investment assets and/or cash required to be 
deposited have not been received by the issuer, 
subject to the condition that the person obligated 
to deposit the investment assets has undertaken to 
deliver them as soon as possible and such 
undertaking is secured by the delivery and 
maintenance of collateral consisting of cash or cash 
equivalents satisfactory to the issuer of the 
Exchange-Traded Fund Shares, all as described in 
the Exchange-Traded Fund Shares’ prospectus. 
17
The market supply information can be obtained 
from publicly available sources such as 
coingecko.com or coinmarketcap.com. 18
For example, if Bitcoin were the underlying 
crypto asset, the Exchange would consider the total 
supply of all Bitcoin currently issued instead of the 
maximum supply, which would be currently issued 
as well as unminted Bitcoin. As of September 12, 
2025, Bitcoin’s total supply was 19,919,915 (the 
maximum supply was 21,000,000). See https://
www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin. The Exchange would calculate market value by utilizing 
the total supply number multiplied by the Bitcoin 
price on that day.

Exchange Rule 403(b)(5) provides, if an 
underlying security is approved for options listing 
and trading under the provisions of Rule 402(c), the 
trading volume of the Original Equity Security (as 
therein defined) prior to but not after the 
commencement of trading in the Restructure 
Security (as therein defined), including ‘‘when- 
issued’’ trading, may be taken into account in 
determining whether the trading volume 
requirement of subparagraph (3) is satisfied. 
21
See Exchange Rule 403(g). With this filing the Exchange is also proposing to amend Exchange 
Rule 403(g) to reflect the changes in numbering 
proposed herein for Exchange Rule 402(i). 
22
See id. 
23
Exchange Rule 403(b)(1) through (3) provides, 
if: (1) there are fewer than 6,300,000 shares of the 
underlying security held by persons other than 
those who are required to report their security 
holdings under Section 16(a) of the Act, (2) there 
are fewer than 1,600 holders of the underlying 
security, (3) the trading volume (in all markets in 
which the underlying security is traded) has been 
less than 1,800,000 shares in the preceding twelve 
(12) months. 
Additionally, with respect to a 
Commodity-Based Trust that meets the 
requirements of Exchange Rule 402(i)(6), the 
following requirements are satisfied: (A) the 
total global supply of the underlying crypto 
asset held by the Commodity-Based Trust has 
an average daily market value of at least $700 
million over the last 12 months; and (B) the 
crypto asset held by the Commodity-Based 
Trust underlies a derivatives contract that 
trades on a market with which the Exchange 
has a comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement, whether directly or through 
common membership in the Intermarket 
Surveillance Group. For purposes of this rule 
the term ‘‘crypto asset’’ means an asset that 
is generated, issued and/or transferred using 
a blockchain or similar distributive ledger 
technology network, including but not 
limited to, assets known as ‘‘tokens,’’ ‘‘digital 
assets,’’ ‘‘virtual currencies,’’ and ‘‘coins’’ 
and that relies on cryptographic protocols. 
The proposed additional criteria 
would require a Commodity-Based 
Trust to: (1) meet the generic criteria for 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares of the 
applicable primary listing market and 
hold only a single crypto asset; (2) meet 
the criteria and guidelines set forth in 
Exchange Rule 402(a)
14
and (b),
15
or 
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(i)(B); 
16
and 
meet the requirements in 402(i)(6)(iii) 
prior to listing options on the 
Commodity-Based Trust. 
As proposed, Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6)(iii) requires Commodity-Based 
Trust that meets the requirements of 
402(i)(6) to also satisfy the following 
requirements: (A) the total global supply 
of the underlying crypto asset held by 
the Commodity-Based Trust has an 
average daily market value of at least 
$700 million over the last 12 months; 
and (B) the crypto asset held by the 
Commodity-Based Trust underlies a 
derivatives contract that trades on a 
market with which the Exchange has a 
comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement, whether directly or through 
common membership in the Intermarket 
Surveillance Group (‘‘ISG’’). 
The Exchange defines a ‘‘crypto asset’’ 
at Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(iii) to mean, 
for purposes of this rule, an asset that 
is generated, issued and/or transferred 
using a blockchain or similar 
distributive ledger technology network, 
including but not limited to, assets 
known as ‘‘tokens,’’ ‘‘digital assets,’’ 
‘‘virtual currencies,’’ and ‘‘coins’’ and 
that relies on cryptographic protocols. 
The market value of the underlying 
crypto asset will be calculated by taking 
the total global supply of the particular 
crypto asset multiplied by the token 
price.
17
Total supply of crypto assets 
includes all crypto assets currently 
issued and does not include unissued 
crypto assets.
18
 
Further, the Exchange has specified in 
proposed Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(iii) 
that the crypto asset held by the 
Commodity-Based Trust must underlie a 
derivatives contract that trades on a 
market with which the Exchange has a 
comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement, whether directly or through 
common membership in ISG.
19
The 
Exchange will be required to ensure that 
this requirement is met prior to listing 
options on a Commodity-Based Trust 
pursuant to proposed Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6). 
As a result of this filing, the proposed 
listing criteria would permit a 
Commodity Based Trust that is 
generically listed on the applicable 
primary listing market and holds a 
single crypto asset to qualify for the 
listing of options on that ETF, provided 
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(iii) has also 
been met, as well as the listing criteria 
in Exchange Rule 402(a) and (b), or 
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(i)(B). 
Similar to options on any ETF, an 
option on a Commodity-Based Trust 
that meets the requirements of Exchange 
Rule 402(i)(6) would also be subject to 
the Exchange’s continued listing 
standards for options on ETFs set forth 
in Exchange Rule 403(g). Pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 403(g), ETFs approved 
for options trading pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 402(i) will not be 
deemed to meet the requirements for 
continued approval, and the Exchange 
shall not open for trading any additional 
series of option contracts of the class 
covering that such ETFs, if the ETFs are 
delisted from trading pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 403(b)(4),
20
are halted or 
suspended from trading in their primary 
market.
21
Additionally, options on ETFs 
may be subject to the suspension of 
opening transactions in any of the 
following circumstances:
22
 
(1) in the case of options covering ETFs 
approved for trading under Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6)(i)(A), in accordance with the terms 
of paragraphs (b)(1), (2), and (3) of Exchange 
Rule 403;
23
 
(2) in the case of options covering ETFs 
approved for trading under Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6)(i)(B), following the initial twelve- 
month period beginning upon the 
commencement of trading in the ETFs on a 
national securities exchange and are defined 
as an NMS stock, there are fewer than 50 
record and/or beneficial holders of such ETFs 
for 30 or more consecutive trading days; 
(3) the value of the index or portfolio of 
securities, non-U.S. currency, or portfolio of 
commodities including commodity futures 
contracts, options on commodity futures 
contracts, swaps, forward contracts and/or 
options on physical commodities and/or 
financial instruments and money market 
instruments on which the ETFs are based is 
no longer calculated or available; or 
(4) such other event shall occur or 
condition exist that in the opinion of the 
Exchange makes further dealing in such 
options on the Exchange inadvisable.

Rule 404, which governs the opening of 
options series on a specific underlying

See Exchange Rule 404(b). The monthly expirations are subject to certain listing criteria for 
underlying securities described within Exchange 
Rule 404 and its Interpretations and Policies. 
Monthly listings expire the third Friday of the 
month. The term ‘‘expiration date’’ (unless 
separately defined elsewhere in the OCC By-Laws), 
when used in respect of an option contract (subject 
to certain exceptions), means the third Friday of the 
expiration month of such option contract, or if such 
Friday is a day on which the exchange on which 
such option is listed is not open for business, the 
preceding day on which such exchange is open for 
business. See OCC By-Laws Article I, Section 1. Pursuant to Exchange Rule 404(c), additional series 
of options of the same class may be opened for 
trading on the Exchange when the Exchange deems 
it necessary to maintain an orderly market, to meet 
customer demand or when the market price of the 
underlying stock moves more than five strike prices 
from the initial exercise price or prices. Pursuant 
to Exchange Rule 404(e), new series of options on 
an individual stock may be added until the 
beginning of the month in which the options 
contract will expire. Due to unusual market 
conditions, the Exchange, in its discretion, may add 
a new series of options on an individual stock until 
the close of trading on the business day prior to 
expiration.

security (including ETFs), the Exchange 
will open at least one expiration 
month
24
for options on a Commodity- 
Based Trust that are approved subject to 
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6) and may also 
list series of options on Commodity- 
Based Trust Share for trading on a 
weekly,
25

basis. The Exchange may also list long- 
term equity option series (‘‘LEAPS’’) 
that expire from 12 to 39 months from 
the time they are listed.
28
 
Pursuant to Exchange Rule 404, 
Interpretation and Policy .06, which 
governs strike prices of series of options 
on ETFs, the interval between strike 
prices of series of options on ETFs 
approved for options trading pursuant 
to Exchange Rule 402(i) shall be fixed at 
a price per share which is reasonably 
close to the price per share at which the 
underlying security is traded in the 
primary market at or about the same 
time such series of options is first open 
for trading on the Exchange, or at such 
intervals as may have been established 
on another options exchange prior to the 
initiation of trading on the Exchange. 
With respect to the Short Term Options 
Series or Weekly Program, during the 
month prior to expiration of an option 
class that is selected for the Short Term 
Option Series Program, the strike price 
intervals for the related non-Short Term 
Option (‘‘Related non-Short Term 
Option’’) shall be the same as the strike 
price intervals for the Short Term 
Option.
29
Specifically, the Exchange 
may open for trading Short Term Option 
Series at strike price intervals of (i) 
$0.50 or greater where the strike price 
is less than $100, and $1 or greater 
where the strike price is between $100 
and $150 for all option classes that 
participate in the Short Term Options 
Series Program; (ii) $0.50 for option 
classes that trade in one dollar 
increments and are in the Short Term 
Option Series Program; or (iii) $2.50 or 
greater where the strike price is above 
$150.
30
Additionally, the Exchange may 
list series of options pursuant to the $1 
Strike Price Interval Program,
31
the 
$0.50 Strike Program,
32
and the $2.50 
Strike Price Program.
33
Pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 510, where the price of 
a series of options on a Commodity- 
Based Trust is less than $3.00, the 
minimum increment will be $0.05, and 
where the price is $3.00 or higher, the 
minimum increment will be $0.10
34
 
consistent with the minimum 
increments for options on other ETFs 
listed on the Exchange. Any and all new 
series of a [sic] Commodity-Based Trust 
options that the Exchange lists will be 
consistent and comply with the 
expirations, strike prices, and minimum 
increments set forth in Rules 404 and 
510, as applicable. 
Further, options on a [sic] 
Commodity-Based Trusts that are 
approved subject to Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6) would trade in the same 
manner as options on other ETFs on the 
Exchange. The Exchange Rules that 
currently apply to the listing and 
trading of all options on ETFs on the 
Exchange, including, for example, Rules 
that govern listing criteria, expirations, 
exercise prices, minimum increments, 
position and exercise limits, margin 
requirements, customer accounts and 
trading halt procedures would apply to 
the listing and trading of options on 
Commodity-Based Trusts that are 
approved subject to Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6) in the same manner. 
Position and exercise limits for 
options on Commodity-Based Trusts 
that are approved pursuant to Exchange 
Rule 402(i)(6) would be determined 
pursuant to Exchange Rules 307 and 
309, respectively, as is the case for other 
options on other ETFs. Position and 
exercise limits for options on ETF vary 
according to the number of outstanding 
shares and the trading volumes of the 
underlying ETF over the past six 
months, where the largest in 
capitalization and the most frequently 
traded ETFs have an option position 
and exercise limits of 250,000 contracts 
(with adjustments for splits, re- 
capitalizations, etc.) on the same side of 
the market; and smaller capitalization 
ETFs have position and exercise limits 
of 200,000, 75,000, 50,000 or 25,000 
contracts (with adjustments for splits, 
re-capitalizations, etc.) on the same side 
of the market. Further, Exchange Rule 
1502, which governs margin 
requirements applicable to trading on 
the Exchange, including options on 
ETFs, will also apply to the trading of 
options on a Commodity-Based Trusts 
listed pursuant to Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6). 
The Exchange represents that the 
same surveillance procedures applicable 
to all other options on other ETFs 
currently listed and traded on the 
Exchange will apply to the trading of 
options on Commodity-Based Trusts 
that are approved subject to Exchange 
Rule 402(i)(6).
35
The Exchange 
represents that it has the necessary 
systems capacity to support the new 
option series. The Exchange believes 
that its existing surveillance and 
reporting safeguards are designed to 
deter and detect possible manipulative 
behavior which might potentially arise 
from listing and trading options on 
ETFs, including the listing of options on 
Commodity-Based Trusts that are 
approved subject to Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6). Also, the Exchange may obtain 
information from designated contract 
markets that are members of the ISG 
related to a financial instrument that is 
based, in whole or in part, upon an 
interest in or performance of a crypto 
asset, as applicable. The Exchange has 
specified in proposed Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6) that the crypto asset held by 
the Commodity-Based Trust must 
underlie a derivatives contract that 
trades on a market with which the 
Exchange has a comprehensive 
surveillance sharing agreement, whether 
directly or through common 
membership in ISG.
36
The Exchange 
will be required to ensure that this 
requirement is met prior to listing 
options on a Commodity-Based Trust

Additionally, the Exchange has also 
analyzed its capacity and represents that 
it believes the Exchange and the 
Options Price Reporting Authority or 
‘‘OPRA’’ have the necessary systems 
capacity to handle the additional traffic 
associated with the listing of new series 
of ETFs, including options on a [sic] 
Commodity-Based Trusts, that are 
approved subject to Exchange Rule 
402(i)(6), up to the number of 
expirations currently permissible under 
the Exchange Rules. 
Finally, today, the Exchange lists and 
trades options on ETFs that would 
qualify for listing as an option on a 
Commodity-Based Trust under 
proposed Exchange Rule 402(i)(6),
37
and 
it has not identified any issues with the 
listing and trading of options on those 
ETFs. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the Act 
and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
38
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5)
39
requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged 
in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, 
and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
40
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
In particular, the Exchange believes 
that its proposal to establish new listing 
criteria at Exchange Rule 402(i)(6) with 
respect to options on Commodity-Based 
Trusts, without the need for additional 
approvals, will remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system and, in general, protect investors 
because it would allow the Exchange to 
immediately list and trade qualifying 
options on Commodity-Based Trusts, 
provided the initial listing criteria has 
been met, without any additional 
approvals from the Commission. 
Specifically, the Exchange’s proposal 
to adopt Exchange Rule 402(i)(6) to 
allow the listing and trading of options 
on units that represent interests in 
Commodity-Based Trusts that meet the 
generic listing standards for 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares of the 
applicable primary listing market,
41
and 
hold a single crypto asset, is consistent 
with the Act because it will permit the 
Exchange to offer options on 
Commodity-Based Trusts soon after the 
listing of the ETF on the primary listing 
market, provided that all the generic 
listing standards for that Commodity- 
Based Trust on that primary listing 
market have been met. Listing these 
options will avail market participants of 
the opportunity to hedge their positions 
in the Commodity-Based Trusts in a 
timely manner, thereby providing 
investors with the ability to hedge their 
exposure to the underlying Commodity- 
Based Trust. Options on Commodity- 
Based Trusts benefits investors, similar 
to the listing of any other option on an 
ETF, by providing investors with a 
relatively lower-cost risk management 
tool to manage their positions and 
associated risk in their portfolios more 
easily in connection with exposure to 
the price of a crypto asset. Additionally, 
listing options on Commodity-Based 
Trusts provides investors with the 
ability to transact in such options on a 
listed market as opposed to the OTC 
options market, which increases market 
transparency and enhances the process 
of price discovery to the benefit of all 
investors. 
Also, this proposal would permit 
options on Commodity-Based Trusts to 
be listed on the Exchange in the same 
manner as all other securities that are 
subject to the current listing criteria in 
Exchange Rule 402. The Exchange notes 
that the majority of ETFs are able to list 
and trade options once the initial listing 
criteria have been met without the need 
for additional approvals. The proposed 
rule change would allow options on 
certain Commodity-Based Trusts to 
likewise list and trade options once the 
initial listing criteria on the primary 
listing market have been met without 
the need for additional approvals. 
As proposed, the Exchange would list 
options in a Commodity-Based Trust 
that met the generic criteria of the 
applicable primary listing market, 
provided the Commodity-Based Trust 
held only a single crypto asset. Further, 
these options on Commodity-Based 
Trusts would also be required to satisfy 
the conditions in proposed Exchange 
Rule 402(i)(6)(iii). Specifically, a 
Commodity-Based Trust that met the 
requirements of proposed Exchange 
Rule 402(i)(6) would also have to satisfy 
the following requirements in proposed 
Exchange Rule 402(i)(6)(iii): (A) the total 
global supply of the underlying crypto 
asset held by the Commodity-Based 
Trust has an average daily market value 
of at least $700 million over the last 12 
months; and (B) the crypto asset held by 
the Commodity-Based Trust underlies a 
derivatives contract that trades on a 
market with which the Exchange has a 
comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement, whether directly or through 
common membership in the ISG. 
These requirements are consistent 
with the Act and the protection of 
investors as they should ensure that the 
underlying ETF has sufficient liquidity 
prior to listing options, which will serve 
to prevent disruption to the underlying 
market. The Exchange believes that 
market supply serves as a good measure 
of liquidity to prevent the addition of 
options trading on the Commodity- 
Based Trust from disrupting the market 
for the underlying security. Requiring 
the underlying crypto asset to have a 
requisite amount of deliverable supply, 
in addition to all the other criteria the 
ETF is required to have under the 
applicable primary listing market rules, 
should ensure adequate liquidity prior 
to listing. Further, ensuring the crypto 
asset held by the Commodity-Based 
Trust underlies a derivatives contract 
that trades on a market with which the 
Exchange has a comprehensive 
surveillance sharing agreement, whether 
directly or through common 
membership in the ISG, will provide the 
Exchange with information to 
adequately surveillance options on 
qualifying Commodity-Based Trusts. 
Today, the Exchange has a 
comprehensive surveillance sharing 
agreement in place with both the CME 
and Coinbase Derivatives through its 
common membership in ISG. This 
facilitates the sharing of information 
that is available to the CME and 
Coinbase Derivatives through their 
surveillance of their respective markets, 
including their surveillance of their 
respective digital asset futures markets. 
The Exchange also believes the 
proposed rule change will remove 
impediments to and perfect the

The following ETFs currently have options 
listed on them on the Exchange: iShares Bitcoin 
Trust, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, the 
ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin 
Trust (BTC), the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust BTC, 
and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF. See Exchange Rule 402(i)(4). The Exchange filed rule proposals and 
received the appropriate regulatory notice or 
approval to list the aforementioned options on the 
ETFs.

the Commission written notice of its intent to file 
the proposed rule change at least five business days 
prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule 
change, or such shorter time as designated by the 
Commission. The Commission is waiving this

mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, because 
it is consistent with current Exchange 
Rules, previously filed with the 
Commission. Options on qualifying 
Commodity-Based Trusts must satisfy 
the initial listing standards and 
continued listing standards currently in 
the Exchange Rules applicable to 
options on all ETFs, including ETFs that 
hold other crypto assets already deemed 
appropriate for options trading on the 
Exchange in addition to the proposed 
criteria. Options on qualifying 
Commodity-Based Trusts would trade in 
the same manner as any other ETF 
options—the same Exchange Rules that 
currently govern the listing and trading 
of all ETF options, including 
permissible expirations, strike prices 
and minimum increments, and 
applicable position and exercise limits 
and margin requirements, will govern 
the listing and trading of options on 
qualifying Commodity-Based Trusts. 
The Exchange represents that it has 
the necessary systems capacity to 
support the listing and trading of 
options on qualifying Commodity-Based 
Trusts. The Exchange believes that its 
existing surveillance and reporting 
safeguards are designed to deter and 
detect possible manipulative behavior 
which might arise from listing and 
trading of these options on Commodity- 
Based Trust, particularly in light of the 
additional requirement that the crypto 
asset held by the Commodity-Based 
Trust underlies a derivatives contract 
that trades on a market with which the 
Exchange has a comprehensive 
surveillance sharing agreement, whether 
directly or through common 
membership in ISG. 
Finally, today, the Exchange lists and 
trades options on ETFs that would 
qualify for listing as an option on a 
Commodity-Based Trust under 
proposed Exchange Rule 402(i)(6),
42
and 
it has not identified any issues with the 
listing and trading of options on those 
ETFs. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. In this regard 
and as indicated above, the Exchange 
notes that the rule change is being 
proposed as a competitive response to 
the filing submitted by ISE.
43
 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposal to amend the listing 
criteria at Exchange Rule 402(i)(6), with 
respect to ETFs, to adopt new criteria to 
permit the listing and trading of options 
on certain Commodity-Based Trusts that 
hold a single crypto asset and that were 
listed pursuant to the generic listing 
standards for Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares of the applicable primary listing 
market, without the need for additional 
approvals, will impose any burden on 
intramarket competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. Options on 
qualifying Commodity-Based Trusts 
would need to satisfy the initial listing 
standards set forth in the Exchange 
Rules in the same manner as any other 
ETF before the Exchange could list 
options on them. Additionally, options 
on qualifying Commodity-Based Trusts 
will be equally available to all market 
participants who wish to trade such 
options. The Exchange Rules currently 
applicable to the listing and trading of 
options on ETFs on the Exchange will 
apply in the same manner to the listing 
and trading of all options on qualifying 
Commodity-Based Trusts. 
Additionally, the Exchange notes that 
listing and trading options on qualifying 
Commodity-Based Trusts on the 
Exchange will subject such options to 
transparent exchange based rules as 
well as price discovery and liquidity, as 
opposed to alternatively trading such 
options in the OTC market. The 
Exchange believes that the proposed 
rule change may relieve any burden on, 
or otherwise promote, competition as it 
is designed to increase competition for 
order flow on the Exchange in a manner 
that is beneficial to investors by 
providing them with a lower-cost option 
to hedge their investment portfolios in 
a timely manner. 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposal to adopt new listing 
criteria at Exchange Rule 402(i)(6) to 
permit the listing and trading of certain 
options on a Commodity-Based Trust, 
without the need for additional 
approvals, will impose any burden on 
intermarket competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. Other 
options exchanges are free to amend 
their applicable rules to permit them to 
list and trade options on Commodity- 
Based Trusts. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
Written comments were neither 
solicited nor received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: (i) significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant 
burden on competition; and (iii) become 
operative for 30 days from the date on 
which it was filed, or such shorter time 
as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
44
and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b–4 
thereunder.
45
 
A proposed rule change filed under 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
46
normally does not 
become operative prior to 30 days after 
the date of the filing. However, pursuant 
to Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii),
47
the 
Commission may designate a shorter 
time if such action is consistent with 
protection of investors and the public 
interest. The Exchange has asked the 
Commission to waive the 30-day 
operative delay so that the proposed 
rule change may become operative 
immediately upon filing. The 
Commission believes that waiving 30- 
day operative delay is consistent with 
the protection of investors and the 
public interest because the proposal 
seeks to amend the Exchange’s rules to 
be consistent with an amendment filed 
by the Exchange during a government 
shutdown, and which would have 
replaced the proposed rule change that 
did become effective if the Commission 
could have received amendments 
during the pendency of the government 
shutdown.
48
The proposal also aligns 
the rule text relating to Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares with the rule text of 
other exchanges and does not introduce 
any novel regulatory issues.
49
 
Accordingly, the Commission

For purposes only of waiving the 30-day 
operative delay, the Commission also has 
considered the proposed rule’s impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See

investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; The 
Nasdaq Stock Market LLC; Order 
Instituting Proceedings To Determine 
Whether To Approve or Disapprove a 
Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by 
Amendment No. 1, To Adopt Additional 
Initial Listing Criteria for Companies 
Primarily Operating in China 
December 18, 2025. 
I. Introduction 
On September 4, 2025, the Nasdaq 
Stock Market LLC (‘‘Exchange’’ or 
‘‘Nasdaq’’) filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (‘‘Commission’’), 
pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’)
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
a 
proposed rule change to adopt 
additional initial listing criteria for 
companies primarily operating in the 
People’s Republic of China (‘‘China’’), 
including the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region (‘‘Hong Kong’’) 
and the Macau Special Administrative 
Region (‘‘Macau’’). On September 12, 
2025, the Exchange filed Amendment 
No. 1 to the proposed rule change, 
which replaced and superseded the 
original filing in its entirety. The 
proposed rule change, as modified by 
Amendment No. 1, was published for 
comment in the Federal Register on 
September 19, 2025.
3
On September 25, 
2025, the Commission designated a 
longer period within which to take 
action on the proposed rule change.
4
 
The Commission is instituting 
proceedings pursuant to Section 
19(b)(2)(B) of the Act
5
to determine 
whether to approve or disapprove the 
proposed rule change, as modified by 
Amendment No. 1. 
II. Description of the Proposed Rule 
Change, as Modified by Amendment 
No. 1 
As described in more detail in the 
Notice,
6
the Exchange states that, since 
2020, there has been a sharp increase in 
the number of companies from China 
seeking to list on U.S. national 
securities exchanges, such as Nasdaq, 
with a record number of Chinese 
companies having sought a U.S. listing 
in 2024 and a continuation of that pace 
in 2025.
7
The Exchange states that along 
with increasing U.S. investor interest in 
Chinese companies, U.S. policymakers 
and regulatory agencies have voiced 
concerns regarding the listing of 
Chinese companies on U.S. national 
securities exchanges, citing risks to 
investors and national security.
8
In 
response, efforts have been made by 
Congress,
9
as well as by Nasdaq,
10
to 
address these concerns on a broader 
level.
11
 
The Exchange states that it has also 
identified concerns with the trading of 
companies headquartered, incorporated, 
or whose business is principally 
administered in China.
12
Specifically, 
the Exchange states that ‘‘nearly 70% of 
the matters that Nasdaq has referred to 
the SEC or FINRA since August 2022 
have been related to trading in Chinese 
companies, while Chinese companies 
represent less than 10% of all Nasdaq 
listings.’’
13
The Exchange also states 
that Chinese companies that list on 
Nasdaq through an initial public 
offering (‘‘IPO’’) or business 
combination with certain 
characteristics, such as a small offering 
size or a low public float percentage, 
may not develop sufficient public float,

See id. 
15
Id. 
16
See id. The Exchange states that a company 
that falls under proposed Nasdaq Rule 5210(l) 
would also need to comply with all other applicable 
listing requirements. See id. at 45300. 
17
The Exchange also proposes to renumber the 
remainder of Nasdaq Rule 5210 as subsections (m) 
and (n). 
18
The Exchange states that it would consider the 
proposed ‘‘elements holistically, recognizing that 
there are various factors to consider when 
determining where a company conducts its 
principal business activities.’’ Id. 
19
See proposed Nasdaq Rule 5210(l). The Exchange states that several of the factors in 
proposed Nasdaq Rule 5210(l) are used in its rules 
to determine whether a company’s business is 
principally administered in a ‘‘Restrictive Market.’’ 
See Notice, supra note 3, at 45300, n.11; Nasdaq Rule 5005(a)(37) (defining ‘‘Restrictive Market’’ to 
mean ‘‘a jurisdiction that does not provide the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board with 
access to conduct inspections of public accounting 
firms that audit Nasdaq-listed companies. A 
Company’s business will be considered to be 
principally administered in a Restrictive Market if: 
(i) the Company’s books and records are located in 
that jurisdiction; (ii) at least 50% of the Company’s 
assets are located in such jurisdiction; or (iii) at 
least 50% of the Company’s revenues are derived 
from such jurisdiction.’’). 
20
Nasdaq Rule 5005(a)(17) defines ‘‘Firm 
Commitment Offering’’ as ‘‘an offering of securities 
by participants in a selling syndicate under an 
agreement that imposes a financial commitment on 
participants in such syndicate to purchase such 
securities.’’ 
21
Nasdaq Rule 5005(a)(36) defines ‘‘Public 
Holders’’ as ‘‘holders of a security that includes 
both beneficial holders and holders of record, but 
does not include any holder who is, either directly 
or indirectly, an Executive Officer, director, or the 
beneficial holder of more than 10% of the total 
shares outstanding.’’ 
22
See proposed Nasdaq Rule 5210(l)(i). 23
See Notice, supra note 3, at 45300. 24
See Nasdaq Rule 5005(a)(23), (46) for the definitions of ‘‘Market Value’’ and ‘‘Unrestricted 
Publicly Held Shares.’’ See also Nasdaq Rule 
5005(a)(35), (38), (47) for the definitions of 
‘‘Publicly Held Shares,’’ ‘‘Restricted Securities,’’ 
and ‘‘Unrestricted Securities.’’ The Exchange states 
that ‘‘Market Value of Unrestricted Publicly Held 
Shares excludes securities subject to resale 
restrictions from the calculation of Publicly Held 
Shares because securities subject to resale 
restrictions are not freely transferrable or available 
for outside investors to purchase and therefore do 
not truly contribute to a security’s liquidity upon 
listing.’’ Notice, supra note 3, at 45300. 25
See proposed Nasdaq Rule 5210(l)(ii). The Exchange states that adopting this additional 
requirement would help prevent China-based 
companies from using a business combination to 
avoid the requirement being imposed on IPOs in 
proposed Nasdaq Rule 5210(l)(i). 
26
See Notice, supra note 3, at 45300. 27
See proposed Nasdaq Rule 5210(l)(iii). 28
See id. The Exchange states that adopting this 
additional requirement would help prevent 
companies from using a direct listing to avoid the 
requirement being imposed on IPOs in proposed 
Nasdaq Rule 5210(1)(i). See Notice, supra note 3, at 45301. 
29
See supra note 24 (defining ‘‘Market Value of 
Unrestricted Publicly Held Shares’’). 
30
See proposed Nasdaq Rule 5210(l)(iv). investor base, and trading interest to 
provide the liquidity necessary to 
promote fair and orderly trading, and 
that as a result their securities may be 
more susceptible to manipulation by 
bad actors.
14
Moreover, the Exchange 
states that challenges related to the 
ability of ‘‘U.S. authorities in bringing or 
enforcing actions against entities and 
individuals involved in potentially 
manipulative trading activities’’ in such 
cases further compounds the risk to 
investors.
15
Accordingly, the Exchange 
proposes to enhance its initial listing 
standards by adopting stricter 
requirements for companies based in 
China (including Hong Kong and 
Macau).
16
 
A. Identification of Companies Based in 
China, Hong Kong, and Macau 
The Exchange proposes to adopt 
listing requirements in Nasdaq Rule 
5210(l)
17
that would apply to a 
company that is headquartered or 
incorporated in China (including Hong 
Kong and Macau) or whose business is 
principally administered in one of those 
jurisdictions (‘‘China-based company’’). 
The Exchange would determine where a 
company is principally administered 
based on an analysis of the facts and 
circumstances,
18
including if: (1) the 
company’s books and records are 
located in that jurisdiction; (2) at least 
50% of the company’s assets are located 
in such jurisdiction; (3) at least 50% of 
the company’s revenues are derived 
from such jurisdiction; (4) at least 50% 
of the company’s directors are citizens 
of, or reside in, such jurisdiction; (5) at 
least 50% of the company’s officers are 
citizens of, or reside in, such 
jurisdiction; (6) at least 50% of the 
company’s employees are based in such 
jurisdiction; or (7) the company is 
controlled by, or under common control 
with, one or more persons or entities 
that are citizens of, reside in, or whose 
business is headquartered, incorporated, 
or principally administered in such 
jurisdiction.
19
 
B. Minimum $25 Million Offering Size 
for an IPO 
The Exchange proposes to require 
that, in the case of an IPO, a China- 
based company must offer a minimum 
amount of securities in a Firm 
Commitment Offering
20
in the U.S. to 
Public Holders
21
that would result in 
gross proceeds to the company of at 
least $25 million.
22
The Exchange states 
that it has observed that China-based 
companies listing on Nasdaq in 
connection with an IPO with an offering 
size below $25 million have a higher 
rate of compliance concerns.
23
 
C. Minimum $25 Million Market Value 
of Publicly Held Shares for a Business 
Combination 
The Exchange proposes to require that 
in the case of a business combination, 
as described in Nasdaq Rule 5110(a) 
(Business Combinations with non- 
Nasdaq Entities Resulting in a Change of 
Control) or IM–5101–2 (Listing of 
Companies Whose Business Plan is to 
Complete One or More Acquisitions) 
(‘‘Business Combination’’), a China- 
based company must have a minimum 
Market Value of Unrestricted Publicly 
Held Shares
24
following the business 
combination equal to at least $25 
million.
25
The Exchange states that 
Business Combinations involving 
China-based companies present similar 
risk to U.S. investors as do IPOs that 
involve China based-companies.
26
 
D. Direct Listings of China-Based 
Companies 
The Exchange proposes to provide 
that, in the case of a Direct Listing (as 
defined in Nasdaq Rule IM–5315–1 
(Determination of Price-Based 
Requirements for Direct Listings on the 
Nasdaq Global Select Market)), a China- 
based company must meet: (i) all 
applicable listing requirements for the 
Nasdaq Global Select Market and the 
additional requirements of IM–5315–1; 
or (ii) the applicable listing 
requirements for the Nasdaq Global 
Market and the additional requirements 
of IM–5405–1 (Determination of Price- 
Based Requirements for Direct Listings 
on the Nasdaq Global Market).
27
 
Further, a China-based company would 
not be permitted to list on the Nasdaq 
Capital Market in connection with a 
Direct Listing.
28
 
E. Transfer of a China-Based Company 
Listing 
The Exchange proposes to provide 
that in the case of a China-based 
company transferring its listing from the 
over-the-counter (‘‘OTC’’) market or 
from another national securities 
exchange, the company must have a 
minimum Market Value of Unrestricted 
Publicly Held Shares
29
of at least $25 
million and have traded on the other 
market for at least one year.
30
The 
Exchange states that a China-based 
company that initially lists on another 
market and ‘‘quickly transfer[s] its 
listing to Nasdaq’’ may present similar 
risks to U.S. investors as an IPO and that 
the minimum one-year requirement 
would provide sufficient time for a 
China-based company ‘‘to establish a 
trading history of operations upon 
which investors can rely, and which 
Nasdaq could consider in determining 
whether the company is ready for the 
rigors of being public company and

Notice, supra note 3, at 45301. The Exchange states that companies trading in the OTC market at 
the time of application must also satisfy a minimum 
average daily trading volume before initial listing. 
See id. at 45301, n.19; Nasdaq Rules 5405(a)(4) and

‘‘operational jurisdiction and regulatory overnight, 
not citizenship per se’’ so as not to create 
‘‘unintended barriers for legitimate issuers

requirements.’’
31
 
F. Implementation 
Finally, the Exchange proposes that 
the effective date of the proposal would 
be 30 days after Commission approval 
and thus apply to companies listing on 
or after 30 days from the date of the 
Commission’s approval order.

III. Proceedings To Determine Whether 
To Approve or Disapprove SR– 
NASDAQ–2025–069, as Modified by 
Amendment No. 1, and Grounds for 
Disapproval Under Consideration 
The Commission is instituting 
proceedings pursuant to Section 
19(b)(2)(B) of the Act
33
to determine 
whether the proposed rule change, as 
modified by Amendment No. 1, should 
be approved or disapproved. Institution 
of such proceedings is appropriate at 
this time in view of the legal and policy 
issues raised by the proposed rule 
change. Institution of proceedings does 
not indicate that the Commission has 
reached any conclusions with respect to 
any of the issues involved. Rather, as 
described below, the Commission seeks 
and encourages interested persons to 
provide additional comment on the 
proposed rule change to inform the 
Commission’s analysis of whether to 
approve or disapprove the proposed 
rule change, as modified by Amendment 
No. 1. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the 
Act,
34
the Commission is providing 
notice of the grounds for disapproval 
under consideration. The Commission is 
instituting proceedings to allow for 
additional analysis of, and input from 
commenters with respect to, the 
proposed rule change’s consistency with 
the Act, and in particular, Section 
6(b)(5) of the Act, which requires, 
among other things, that the rules of a 
national securities exchange be 
designed to prevent fraudulent and 
manipulative acts and practices, to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest.
35
 
The development and enforcement of 
meaningful listing standards
36
by an 
exchange is of critical importance to 
financial markets and the investing 
public. Among other things, such listing 
standards help ensure that exchange- 
listed companies will have sufficient 
public float, investor base, and trading 
interest to provide the depth and 
liquidity to promote fair and orderly 
markets. Meaningful listing standards 
are also important given investor 
expectations regarding the nature of 
securities that have achieved an 
exchange listing, and the role of an 
exchange in overseeing its market and 
assuring compliance with its listing 
standards.
37
 
As discussed above, the Exchange 
proposes to adopt heightened initial 
listing requirements for China-based 
companies. The Exchange states that 
China-based companies that have 
certain characteristics, such as a small 
offering size or a low public float 
percentage, may not develop sufficient 
public float, investor base, and trading 
interest to provide the liquidity 
necessary to promote fair and orderly 
trading, and that as a result their 
securities may be more susceptible to 
manipulation by bad actors.
38
The 
Exchange also states that U.S. 
authorities face challenges in such cases 
in bringing or enforcing actions against 
entities and individuals involved in 
potentially manipulative trading 
activities, and that these challenges 
compound the risk to investors.
39
 
One commenter expressed general 
support for the proposal.
40
This 
commenter stated that it supports 
‘‘Nasdaq for taking action to preserve 
market integrity from the high volatility 
and potential market manipulation of 
the smallest microcap Chinese 
companies.’’
41
Another commenter 
supported the proposal, but 
recommended that ‘‘the increased 
standards should apply to companies 
based in additional foreign jurisdictions 
where it is determined there are 
elevated levels of fraud.’’
42
This 
commenter stated that, ‘‘[o]therwise, 
fraudsters will simply move to other 
jurisdictions where it’s even easier to 
commit fraud’’ and that ‘‘other 
jurisdictions also see many instances of 
fraudulent activities.’’
43
 
Another commenter proposed certain 
modifications to the proposal, while 
also expressing general support for 
Nasdaq’s ongoing efforts to enhance its 
listing standards.
44
In particular, this 
commenter expressed concern that the 
proposed scope of issuers that would be 
considered to be China-based 
companies ‘‘could capture issuers that 
are incorporated, headquartered, and 
operating entirely in the United States, 
or in other transparent jurisdictions, 
merely because (i) they were founded or 
controlled by entrepreneurs who are 
Chinese citizens or (ii) 50% of their 
officers or directors are Chinese citizens, 
even if such individuals have long 
resided in the United States.’’
45
This 
commenter stated that it believes that 
the current proposal ‘‘risks 
unintentionally capturing issuers that 
do not present the same regulatory 
concerns’’ for which the proposal was 
designed to address and suggested that 
the requirements in the proposal only 
apply to issuers ‘‘principally operating 
in China, rather than issuers that are 
based in the U.S. simply because their 
founders, controlling persons, directors, 
or officers are Chinese citizens.’’

Letter from Joseph D. Wilson, Esq., Bevilacqua

Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, as amended by the 
Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Public Law

flexibility to determine what type of proceeding— 
either oral or notice and opportunity for written 
comments—is appropriate for consideration of a 
particular proposal by a self-regulatory 
organization. See Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing & Urban 
Affairs, S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 30 
(1975). 
54
17 CFR 200.30–3(a)(57). 
commenter also suggested extending the 
transition period for compliance with 
the proposal from 30 days to 60 days for 
issuers with pending initial listing 
applications.
47
 
Finally, one commenter opposed the 
proposal, stating it ‘‘would be unlawful 
and make for bad policy.’’
48
This 
commenter stated that the proposal is 
‘‘not necessary or appropriate to protect 
national security’’ and is ‘‘anti- 
competitive as it discriminates against 
certain Chinese issuers imposing 
additional, more onerous listing criteria 
on them than are imposed on other 
foreign issuers.’’
49
Additionally, the 
commenter stated that the proposal does 
not provide adequate justification for 
being ‘‘writ[ten] . . . in terms of 
national origin.’’
50
 
The Commission asks that 
commenters address the sufficiency of 
the Exchange’s statements in support of 
the proposal, which are set forth in the 
Notice, in addition to any other 
comments they may wish to submit 
about the proposed rule change, as 
modified by Amendment No. 1. In 
particular, the Commission seeks 
comment on whether the proposal to 
impose heightened initial listing 
requirements on China-based issuers is 
designed to be consistent with the 
requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the 
Act
51
or raises any new or novel 
concerns not previously contemplated 
by the Commission. 
IV. Procedure: Request for Written 
Comments 
The Commission requests that 
interested persons provide written 
submissions of their data, views, and 
arguments with respect to the issues 
identified above, including the issues 
raised by commenters and the 
Exchange’s response, as well as any 
other concerns they may have with the 
proposal. In particular, the Commission 
invites the written views of interested 
persons concerning whether the 
proposed rule change, as modified by 
Amendment No. 1, is consistent with 
Sections 6(b)(5) or any other provision 
of the Act, or the rules and regulations 
thereunder. Although there do not 
appear to be any issues relevant to 
approval or disapproval that would be 
facilitated by an oral presentation of 
data, views, and arguments, the 
Commission will consider, pursuant to 
Rule 19b–4 under the Act,
52
any request 
for an opportunity to make an oral 
presentation.
53
 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views, and 
arguments regarding whether the 
proposed rule change, as modified by 
Amendment No. 1, should be approved 
or disapproved by January 13, 2026. 
Any person who wishes to file a rebuttal 
to any other person’s submission must 
file that rebuttal by January 27, 2026.

Exchange’s statements in support of the 
proposal, in addition to any other 
comments they may wish to submit 
about the proposed rule change.

Abstract of Proposed Collection 
The DS–7794 is completed by panel 
physicians to report the medical status 
of visa applicants; refugees; follow-to- 
join refugees and asylees; and certain 
parolees. The form records the medical 
information necessary to determine 
whether an alien has a medical 
condition affecting his or her eligibility 
for a visa or immigration benefit. The 
information requested is limited to the 
result of any diagnostic tests required 
for the diagnosis of diseases identified 
as communicable diseases of public 
health significance, as well as other 
evaluations identified as necessary to 
confirm a medical ineligibility under 
INA § 212(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(1) or to 
comply with other requirements. 
Collecting this information is essential 
to protecting public health in the United 
States. 
Methodology 
A panel physician, designated by the 
consular post, performs a medical 
examination of the applicant and 
completes the electronic form in the 
eMedical portal in accordance with 
instructions issued by the Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC). The information 
collected is retained by the Bureau of 
Consular Affairs and available to the 
CDC and DHS.

Abstract of Proposed Collection 
The collection of information 
requested on the DS–1838 and DS–7783 
is necessary to comply with: 
Homeland Security Presidential 
Directive 12 (HSPD–12) was issued 
August 27, 2004, to set policy for a 
common, reliable, and secure 
identification standard for federal 
employees and contractors for accessing 
federally controlled facilities and 
federal information systems. In order to 
keep Federal and other facilities where 
there is potential for terrorist attacks 
secure, wide variations in the quality 
and security of forms of identification 
need to be eliminated. 
Federal Information Processing 
Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) is 
a United Stated Federal government 
standard that specifies Personal Identity 
Verification (PIV) requirements for 
Federal employees and contractors. The 
NIST (National Institute of Standards 
and Technology) Computer Security 
Division initiated a new program for 
improving the identification and 
authentication of Federal employees 
and contractors for access to Federal 
facilities and information systems. 
All Department employees and 
contractors are required to submit 
application for a Personal Identification 
Card (DS–1838 domestically or DS–7783 
overseas) at the time of hire. 
Methodology 
Information is collected by a form 
(obtained from MyData forms) or 
automated badge request (ABR) online.

Abstract of Proposed Collection 
Forms for this collection are 
completed by panel physicians on 
behalf of aliens seeking a visa; refugees; 
refugees and asylees (including 
following-to-join); and certain parolees. 
The forms record the medical 
information necessary to determine 
whether an alien has a medical or other 
condition affecting his or her eligibility

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60220 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Notices for a visa or immigration benefit. The 
information requested includes the 
result of any diagnostic tests required 
for the diagnosis of diseases identified 
as communicable diseases of public 
health significance, as well as other 
evaluations identified as necessary to 
confirm a medical ineligibility under 
INA § 212(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(1) or to 
comply with other requirements. 
Collecting this information is essential 
to protecting public health in the United 
States. 
Methodology 
A panel physician designated by the 
consular post performs a medical 
examination of the applicant and 
completes the forms according to 
instructions issued by the Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC). Respondents 
submit the forms to the appropriate 
embassy or consulate, either by 
providing the completed forms with the 
applicant in a sealed envelope or by 
sending them directly via courier. The 
information collected is retained by the 
Bureau of Consular Affairs. It is also 
provided to CDC and the Department of 
Homeland Security upon arrival at the 
port of entry. 
Agency Response to 60-Day Notice 
Public Comments 
The Department solicited public 
comments for a period of 60 days with 
the publication of 90 FR 16420 (April 
17, 2025). During this initial 60-day 
notice-and-comment period, the Public 
submitted three responsive comments 
and raised several concerns for the 
Department’s consideration. 
Issue #1—Applicant Medical 
Information Access Rights: 
‘‘Reclassifying the respondent as the 
panel physician must not inadvertently 
curtail an individual’s ability to obtain 
and review his or her own medical 
examination records.’’ 
Reclassification of the respondent 
does not change the designation of those 
completed DS medical forms upon 
which the results of the exam are 
recorded as visa records, which are 
confidential under INA 222(f) and 
generally may not be shared with the 
applicant. Panel physicians remain 
permitted to share their own records in 
the form of lab reports and similar 
documentation with the applicant upon 
request. 
Issue #2—Accessibility and Appeals: 
‘‘Applicants must have access to their 
exam results and an accessible, 
standardized appeals process if they 
believe findings are inaccurate or 
discriminatory.’’ 
Applicants may request the 
underlying test results and medical 
information from the panel physician. If 
an applicant wishes to present 
additional information to attempt to 
overcome a refusal of an immigrant visa 
application, he or she may do so 
consistent with 22 CFR 42.81(e). 
Applicants who wish to overcome 
medical ineligibility must file Form I– 
601 or I–602. These waiver forms are 
submitted to DHS on an individual 
basis. After submission and upon DHS 
request, CDC may review the waiver 
requests and supporting medical 
examination to provide an opinion 
regarding the case. 
Issue #3—HIV Status Information: 
‘‘The DS–2054 series must be updated 
to reflect that HIV is no longer a ground 
of inadmissibility and cannot be used as 
a basis for denial, delay, or stigma.’’ 
While the proposed DS–2054 does not 
contain an HIV status field, the 
Department acknowledges the proposed 
DS–3026 does contain an HIV blood test 
field and the DS–3030 contains a field 
to mark a known HIV infection. All 
panel physicians are required to abide 
by CDC Technical Instructions, which 
provide that HIV testing is 
recommended for individuals with signs 
or symptoms of HIV infection but NOT 
required. 
The Department defers to CDC 
expertise in matters related to protecting 
American public health, and CDC has 
requested the HIV fields remain on the 
Department’s visa medical forms, noting 
that HIV is an important risk factor for 
tuberculosis (the largest cause of death 
among individuals with HIV infection is 
tuberculosis). The CDC Technical 
Instructions, therefore, require 
additional tuberculosis testing for aliens 
who disclose that they have HIV. The 
Technical Instructions make clear that 
HIV is not an inadmissible condition 
(https://www.cdc.gov/immigrant- 
refugee-health/hcp/panel-physicians/ 
index.html#cdc_generic_section_3- technical-instructions), and panel 
physicians are not screening applicants 
for HIV. 
Issue #4—Privacy Protection: ‘‘The 
Department must explicitly define how 
medical data is protected, limit 
disclosure to DHS and CDC only as 
necessary, and prohibit long-term 
storage or secondary use without 
applicant consent.’’ 
An alien’s decision to apply for the 
privilege of entry to the United States is 
voluntary, and furnishing medical 
information as part of that application 
process is also voluntary. Visa records, 
including Personal Health Information 
(PHI), are protected in accordance with 
INA Section 222(f). Consistent with 
Section 222(f), information may be 
provided to other federal agencies who 
need the information to administer or 
enforce U.S. laws and protect homeland 
security. An applicant for a U.S. visa or 
immigration benefit who subjects him- 
or herself to medical examination agrees 
to the disclosure of this PHI in 
accordance with federal law. 
Individuals who fail to disclose 
requested medical information may 
experience processing delays and be 
denied a U.S. visa or immigration 
benefit. The Department of State’s 
record disposition schedule notes that 
visa records are retained by the 
Department temporarily, and longer 
retention is authorized only if required 
for business use. The applicant consents 
to record retention when he or she 
chooses to apply for a U.S. visa or 
immigration benefit. 
Issue #5: Panel Physician Bias and 
Medical Requirements: ‘‘The 
Department must ensure panel 
physicians are trained in trauma- 
informed, culturally competent care and 
prohibit discriminatory screening 
practices based on socioeconomic 
status, English language competency, 
race, gender identity, HIV status, or 
disability.’’ 
The Department defers to CDC with 
respect to panel physician qualifications 
and medical examination requirements. 
Though designated by local U.S. 
embassies or consulates, panel 
physicians are medically trained and 
licensed doctors who must abide by 
standards and technical instructions 
issued by the CDC. Consular sections, in 
collaboration with the Visa Office and 
CDC, may decide to terminate an 
agreement with a panel physician if the 
physician fails to abide by these 
standards and instructions. 
Issue #6: Financial Burden to Alien 
Applicants: ‘‘The Department should cap the costs of medical examinations, 
publish fee ranges, and ensure medical 
examinations remain affordable, 
especially for refugee and asylum 
applicants.’’ 
Respondents to this information 
collection are panel physicians. The 
Paperwork Reduction Act requires 
agencies to estimate burden figures for 
the respondents to an information 
collection. Although subjected to the 
medical examination, alien applicants 
are not respondents as they do not 
complete these forms. As such, burden 
figures associated with out-of-pocket 
costs to alien applicants fall outside the 
scope of this Notice. The Department 
further notes that refugees are not 
responsible for medical examination

SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD 
[Docket No. AB 290 (Sub-No. 420X)] 
Norfolk Southern Railway Company— 
Abandonment Exemption—in the City 
of Baltimore, Md. 
Norfolk Southern Railway Company 
(NSR) has filed a verified notice of 
exemption (NOE) under 49 CFR part 
1152 subpart F—Exempt Abandonments 
to abandon its freight rail easement over 
an approximately one-mile rail line 
extending from milepost UU 0.00 +/¥ 
to milepost UU 1.00 +/¥ in the City of Baltimore, Md. (the Line). The Line 
traverses U.S. Postal Service Zip Codes 
21201 and 21211. 
According to the verified notice, the 
Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) 
owns the portion of the Line from 
milepost UU 0.50 +/¥ to milepost UU 1.00 +/¥,
1
and the National Railroad 
Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) owns 
the portion of the Line from milepost 
UU 0.00 +/¥ to milepost UU 0.50 +/¥ but NSR retained the ‘‘freight operating 
easement, rights and operations’’ for the 
Line. NSR states that because neither 
MTA nor Amtrak have a residual 
common carrier obligation to provide 
rail freight service over the Line, the 
entire common carrier obligation of any 
rail carrier or party to provide freight 
service over the Line will be 
extinguished with the abandonment of 
the freight operating rights. NSR further 
states that MTA’s passenger services 
will continue after NSR abandons its 
easement and, therefore, the corridor is 
not available for alternative public 
use(s) and that it does not intend to 
negotiate for trail use/railbanking. 
NSR has certified that: (1) no local 
freight traffic has moved over the Line 
for at least two years; (2) any overhead 
traffic on the Line can be rerouted over 
other lines; (3) no formal complaint 
filed by a user of rail service on the Line 
(or by a state or local government on 
behalf of such user) regarding cessation 
of service over the Line is pending with 
either the Surface Transportation Board 
(Board) or any U.S. District Court or has 
been decided in favor of a complainant 
within the two-year period; and (4) the 
requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7(b) and 
1105.8(c) (notice of environmental and 
historic reports), 49 CFR 1105.12 
(newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 
1152.50(d)(1) (notice to government 
agencies) have been met. 
As a condition to this exemption, any 
employee adversely affected by the 
abandonment shall be protected under

NSR previously filed a verified NOE to abandon 
the Line on October 31, 2024, in Docket No. AB 290 
(Sub-No. 412X). Notice of the exemption was served 
and published in the Federal Register on November 
20, 2024 (89 FR 91869). On December 6, 2024, NSR 
requested permission to withdraw its NOE to 
resolve certain real estate and other issues. Prior to 
NSR’s request to withdraw its NOE, James Riffin 
filed a notice of intent to file an OFA to purchase 
the Line. The Acting Director of the Office of 
Proceedings (now, the Office of Chief Counsel) 
granted NSR’s request to withdraw its NOE and 
dismissed the proceeding without prejudice to NSR 
seeking authority to abandon the Line in the future.

the Board published notice tentatively 
approving Applicants’ acquisition of 
control of Lavdas Enterprises, Inc., dba 
Lavdas Limousines, Inc. (Lavdas) (90 FR 
57803). See Van Pool Transp. LLC— Acquis. of Control—Lavdas Enters., Inc. 
(Lavdas Transaction), MCF 21140 (STB 
served Dec. 12, 2025); (see also Appl. 11 
n.2). Lavdas primarily provides luxury 
charter transportation service in 
southeast Michigan. Lavdas 
Transaction, MCF 21140, slip op. at 5. On rare occasions, Lavdas’s charter 
operations include interstate service 
into surrounding states, including 
Illinois. (Id.) If no opposing comments 
are timely filed in Docket No. MCF 
21140 with respect to Applicants’ 
acquisition of control of Lavdas, 
Applicants will control 23 interstate 
passenger motor carriers as of January 
27, 2026. 
In the present application, Applicants 
seek Board approval to continue in 
control of Rolling V and STS upon those 
entities obtaining approval from the 
Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration (FMCSA) to operate as 
regulated passenger motor carriers. 
Rolling V is a New York corporation 
that currently operates as a motor carrier 
primarily providing non-regulated 
home-to-school transportation services 
in addition to intrastate charter, shuttle, 
and transit services within the State of 
New York, particularly the cities of 
Walton, Livingston Manor, Neversink, 
Liberty, South Fallsburg, and Ellenville. 
(Appl. 12.) STS is a New Mexico limited 
liability company that currently 
operates as a motor carrier primarily 
providing home-to-school and charter 
student transportation services within 
Dona Ana County, NM, particularly the 
City of Las Cruces and its surrounding 
areas. (Id. at 12–13.) According to Applicants, both Rolling V and STS 
currently operate exclusively in 
intrastate commerce but are seeking 
FMCSA’s approval to expand their 
existing charter operations to include 
interstate service. (Id. at 12.) The application indicates that the interstate 
service provided by Rolling V and STS, 
if authorized, is expected to be, in both 
the near-term and the long-term, an 
insignificant proportion of overall 
service by those entities. (Id.) 
Under 49 U.S.C. 14303(b), the Board 
must approve and authorize a 
transaction that it finds is consistent 
with the public interest, taking into 
consideration at least (1) the effect of the 
proposed transaction on the adequacy of 
transportation to the public, (2) the total 
fixed charges resulting from the 
proposed transaction, and (3) the 
interest of affected carrier employees. 
Here, Applicants have submitted the 
information required by 49 CFR 1182.2, 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:11 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00169 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\23DEN1.SGM 23DEN1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60225 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Notices including (1) information to 
demonstrate that Applicants’ 
continuance in control of Rolling V and 
STS, upon those entities becoming 
regulated passenger motor carriers, is 
consistent with the public interest 
under 49 U.S.C. 14303(b), see 49 CFR 1182.2(a)(7); and (2) a jurisdictional 
statement under 49 U.S.C. 14303(g) that 
the aggregate gross operating revenues 
of the involved carriers exceeded $2 
million during a consecutive 12-month 
period ending not more than six months 
before the date of the agreement of the 
parties, see 49 CFR 1182.2(a)(5). (See Appl. 15–18.) 
Applicants do not expect the 
proposed continuance in control to have 
a material, detrimental impact on the 
adequacy of transportation services 
available to the public. (Id. at 15.) According to Applicants, services 
available to the public will be improved 
as operating efficiencies are realized and 
additional services and capacity are 
made available. (Id.) Applicants add 
that their continuance in control of 
Rolling V and STS is consistent with the 
practices within the passenger motor 
carrier industry of strong, well-managed 
transportation organizations adapting 
their corporate structure to operate 
several different passenger carriers 
within similar service markets, but in 
different geographic areas. (Id. at 15– 16.) Applicants state that the interstate 
charter services to be provided by 
Rolling V and STS would supplement 
the home-to-school student 
transportation services that those 
entities currently provide; that each of 
these market segments have their own 
service characteristics; and that 
Applicants’ continuance in control of 
Rolling V and STS is expected to result 
in improved operating efficiencies, 
increased equipment utilization rates, 
and cost savings derived from 
economies of scale, all of which will 
help to ensure the provision of adequate 
service to the public. (Id.) 
Applicants assert that the impact of 
the transaction on the regulated motor 
carrier industry will be minimal at most. 
(Id. at 18.) According to Applicants, demand for school bus transportation 
and charter services in the areas served 
by Rolling V and STS is strong and is 
expected to increase in the foreseeable 
future. (Id. at 17.) Applicants assert that the markets that Rolling V and STS 
serve are very competitive due to the 
significant number of national, regional, 
and local providers operating in those 
markets. (Id. at 17–18.) Applicants state that, with respect to Rolling V, 
competing providers include Student 
Transportation of America, First 
Student, and Durham School Services. 
(Id. at 18.) Applicants further state that, with respect to STS, competing 
providers include All Aboard America, 
Greyhound Lines, and El Paso 
Limousine. (Id.) Applicants also state 
that Rolling V’s service area and STS’ 
service area are geographically 
dispersed from service areas of the 22 
regulated carriers that Applicants 
control at present and that there is very 
limited overlap in customer bases as 
between those 22 regulated carriers and 
Rolling V and STS. (Id. at 18.) The same appears to be true with respect to 
Lavdas; Rolling V operates primarily in 
New York, STS operates primarily in 
New Mexico, and Lavdas operates 
primarily in southeast Michigan. 
Applicants assert that their 
continuance in control of Rolling V and 
STS will not result in an increase in 
fixed charges. (Id. at 16.) According to Applicants, their 
continuance in control of Rolling V and 
STS is not expected to have a 
substantial impact on employees or 
labor conditions. (Id.) Applicants state 
that Rolling V and STS intend to 
provide the prospective interstate 
service using employee drivers that are 
already qualified to provide interstate 
charter bus service. (Id.) Applicants 
further state that they do not anticipate 
a measurable increase in force or 
changes in compensation levels and/or 
benefits associated with their 
continuance in control. (Id.) 
Based on their representations, the 
Board finds that Applicants’ 
continuance in control of Rolling V and 
STS is consistent with the public 
interest. The application will be 
tentatively approved and authorized. If 
any opposing comments are timely 
filed, these findings will be deemed 
vacated, and, unless a final decision can 
be made on the record as developed, a 
procedural schedule will be adopted to 
reconsider the application. See 49 CFR 1182.6. If no opposing comments are 
filed by expiration of the comment 
period, this notice will take effect 
automatically and will be the final 
Board action in this proceeding. 
This action is categorically excluded 
from environmental review under 49 
CFR 1105.6(c). 
Board decisions and notices are 
available at www.stb.gov. 
It is ordered: 
1. Applicants’ continuance in control 
of Rolling V and STS upon their 
becoming federally regulated passenger 
motor carriers is approved and 
authorized, subject to the filing of 
opposing comments. 
2. If opposing comments are timely 
filed, the findings made in this notice 
will be deemed vacated.

Agency Information Collection 
Activities; Approval of a New 
Information Collection Request: Study 
of Warning Devices for Stopped 
Commercial Motor Vehicles 
AGENCY: Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), Department 
of Transportation (DOT). 
ACTION: Notice and request for comments. 
SUMMARY: In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 
FMCSA announces its plan to submit 
the Information Collection Request (ICR) 
described below to the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) for 
review and approval. This notice invites 
comments on a proposed information 
collection titled ‘‘Study of Warning 
Devices for Stopped Commercial Motor 
Vehicles.’’ It is an experimental study 
that requires data collection for 
evaluating whether warning devices 
meaningfully influence crash-relevant 
aspects of human performance in the 
presence of a parked or disabled 
commercial motor vehicle (PDCMV), 
and if so, how and to what extent. These 
data collection efforts are expected to 
require the participation of 256 drivers. 
A total of 9 comments were provided in 
response to the 60-day Federal Register 
notice (91 FR 1591). The total burden 
hours reported in the 60-day FR 
published on January 8, 2025, has now 
been decreased by 128 hours after 
FMCSA inadvertently included but has 
now removed the 128 hours from the 
burden estimate. The 128 hours is the 
time estimated for respondents to travel 
to and from the location where the 
collection of information will occur. 
DATES: Comments on this notice must be received on or before January 22, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: Written comments and recommendations for the proposed 
information collection should be 
submitted within 30 days of publication 
of this notice to www.reginfo.gov/ 
public/do/PRAMain. Find this information collection by selecting 
‘‘Currently under 30-day Review—Open 
for Public Comments’’ or by using the

prescribe specific rules
4
concerning 
how and where the warning devices 
must be placed, based on road and 
traffic attributes (e.g., whether the road is straight or curved, whether the 
vehicle is stopped in a business or 
residential district, whether the road is 
divided or undivided, etc.) as well as 
the presence of conditions affecting 
visibility (e.g., time of day, physical obstructions, etc.). These requirements 
follow from the basic notion that 
increasing the conspicuity of a PDCMV 
makes it easier to see and recognize, 
thereby reducing the risk of a crash 
involving passing motorists. 
In addition, the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) 
prescribes performance and design 
specifications
5
for warning devices 
under 49 CFR 571.125 of the Federal 
Motor Vehicle Safety Standards 
(FMVSS). For instance, this standard 
establishes minimum specifications for 
factors affecting the conspicuity 
(including reflectivity, color, 
luminance) of warning triangles, the 
most commonly utilized type of 
warning device (due to their reusability, 
shelf life, and fire-risk safety concerns 
compared to flares or fuses). The 
purpose of this standard is ‘‘to assure 
that the warning devices can be readily 
observed during daytime and nighttime 
lighting conditions, have a standardized 
shape for quick message recognition, 
and perform properly when 
deployed.’’
6
 
Public interest in warning device 
requirements for PDCMVs has increased 
in recent years for several reasons. For 
example, advances in automated driving 
system (ADS) technology have raised 
critical questions regarding potential 
barriers to regulatory compliance with 
warning device safety standards
7
and 
regulations
8
which reference or require 
a ‘‘driver.’’ In addition, alternative types 
of warning devices developed by 
industry, including those intended to 
increase driver safety during device 
deployment, have resulted in multiple 
applications for exemption from the 
corresponding safety regulations.
910
 
These recent issues related to warning 
device requirements also call attention 
to the historically unresolved questions 
of whether the use of such devices 
improves traffic safety and, if so, how 
and to what extent. 
Past attempts by the Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA)
11 12
and other 
researchers
13
to answer those questions 
yielded generally inconclusive or 
inconsistent results, which possibly 
influenced NHTSA’s past decision not 
to pursue conducting its own research 
on the topic.
14
FMCSA (previously 
under FHWA) itself has never 
conducted experimental research on the 
impact of using warning devices. As the 
only regulatory authority which still 
requires CMV operators to use warning 
devices, the responsibility to answer 
these questions finally and definitively 
is best charged to FMCSA. 
Given the increasing focus on ADS, 
questions surrounding the safety of 
CMV drivers when deploying warning 
devices, and the availability of new 
technology and alternative devices since 
these questions were last explored in 
the 1980s, there is a need to thoroughly 
evaluate the effectiveness of warning 
devices under current regulations. In 
addition, advanced research 
instruments unavailable or not in use at 
the time of all past research on this 
topic are now in common use and 
would permit far more sophisticated 
analyses of the effects of warning 
devices on driver behavior. This 
includes sensors which can precisely 
measure and record the location of 
vehicles (e.g., differential Global Positioning System), eye-tracking 
devices which allow the researcher to 
determine the precise moment when a 
driver first glanced at a PDCMV, and 
instrumented vehicles which record 
accurate, high-frequency data related to 
drivers’ interactions with a vehicle’s 
controls. 
FMCSA plans to implement these 
modern tools in a controlled experiment 
at a closed-course, state-of-the-art 
driving research facility that will allow 
the most comprehensive examination of 
the effects of warning devices to date. 
The results of the study may support 
future rulemaking related to warning 
devices and provide baseline data 
necessary to inform Agency decisions 
on exemption applications for 
alternative warning device products. 
FMCSA published the 60-day Federal 
Register notice on January 8, 2025, and the comment period closed on March 
10, 2025 (90 FR 1591). A total of nine 
comments were received from the 
public. These comments revolved 
around nine themes: regulatory 
considerations and impact, environment 
or condition-based study factors, study

and risks or challenges with warning 
devices. These are all important 
comments for FMCSA to consider while 
conducting the study or when making 
decisions based on the results of the 
study. However, none of the comments 
directly address the proposed 
information collection or its associated 
costs/impacts. As such, FMCSA 
summarizes the comments but provides 
no response. Many comments touched 
on multiple issues; however, the 
comments below are organized based on 
the primary feedback provided. 
Regulatory Considerations and Impact 
There is widespread recognition that 
regulatory gaps and complexities hinder 
effective deployment and use of 
warning devices. Commenters noted 
that current rules do not adequately 
address the overuse of warning lights, 
and that knowledge gaps continue to 
weaken the regulatory framework’s 
effectiveness. Additionally, legal 
loopholes and the complexity of 
implementing regulations were seen as 
barriers to the adoption of improved 
safety measures. Nonetheless, many 
comments supported FMCSA’s ongoing 
regulatory efforts and encouraged 
further research to improve and 
modernize safety rules. 
Environment or Condition-Based Study 
Factors 
Environmental factors were a 
consistent theme, with many comments 
highlighting how visibility issues— 
compounded by driver inattention, 
curves in the road, and lack of rumble 
strips—reduce the effectiveness of 
warning devices. Visibility varies 
significantly across road types, making 
it essential for studies to account for 
these conditions. Several comments 
advocated for studies to explicitly 
consider how different environmental 
scenarios impact both warning device 
performance and driver response. 
Study Factors for Other Devices 
The public expressed concerns about 
the reliability and effectiveness of 
alternative warning devices. Some noted 
that excessive or competing lights, such 
as flashing beacons, can confuse drivers 
and reduce recognition of genuine 
hazards. Others raised the issue of 
power failure risks in beacons and the 
failure of some warning devices in real- 
world conditions. There was strong 
support for the evaluation of new 
warning technologies and a call to 
remain open to innovative solutions that 
might enhance safety outcomes. 
Automated Vehicle Considerations 
With deployment nearing of driver- 
out ADS-equipped CMVs, commenters 
raised important questions about how 
these technologies interface with 
existing safety requirements. Many 
pointed out that automated vehicles 
(AVs) lack the ability to deploy warning 
devices which introduces new 
regulatory challenges. Concerns 
included the need for AVs to have 
redundant safety systems and the 
potential mismatch between other 
driver expectations and AV capabilities. 
The comments emphasized the need for 
additional human-factors research, 
particularly regarding how drivers 
maintain attention and readiness to 
assume control of ADS-equipped CMVs. 
There was also a call for developing 
specific safety solutions for ADS- 
equipped CMVs and addressing gaps in 
AV breakdown procedures. 
Safety Benefits of and Effectiveness of 
Warning Devices 
Despite some concerns, many 
commenters acknowledged the critical 
role of warning devices in preventing 
accidents. Proper use of these devices 
was praised for offering early hazard 
detection and for being simple yet 
effective. The comments reinforced the 
idea that even basic tools can provide 
significant safety benefits when 
deployed correctly. Public feedback also 
urged FMCSA to validate the 
effectiveness of these tools through 
research and ensure that any new safety 
technologies meet or exceed this 
benchmark. 
Risks or Challenges With Warning 
Devices 
The misuse or overuse of warning 
devices was a key concern, as it can 
reduce their clarity and effectiveness in 
signaling real hazards. Inattentive 
drivers, outdated devices, and the risk 
of device placement on the roadside 
were all cited as challenges. Some 
commenters also mentioned that certain 
warning devices may be dangerous, 
especially when their deployment puts 
drivers at risk. These concerns 
underscore the need for updated 
regulations and evaluations that reflect 
current and emerging road conditions 
and technologies.

Administration (FTA) is requesting 
Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) 3-year approval of an extension 
without change for a currently approved

Administration’s Emergency Relief 
program enables FTA to provide 
assistance to public transit operators in 
the aftermath of an emergency or major 
disaster. The program helps states and 
public transportation systems pay for 
protecting, repairing, and/or replacing 
equipment and facilities that may suffer 
or have suffered serious damage as a 
result of an emergency, including 
natural disasters such as floods, 
hurricanes, and tornadoes. The program 
can fund capital projects to protect, 
repair, or replace facilities or equipment 
that are in danger of suffering serious 
damage, or have suffered serious 
damage because of an emergency. The 
program can also fund the operating 
costs of evacuation, rescue operations, 
temporary public transportation service, 
or reestablishing, expanding, or 
relocating service before, during or after 
an emergency. Congress appropriates 
funding for FTA’s Emergency Relief 
Program based on estimates of the 
funding needed to assist public 
transportation providers with capital 
projects to repair and rebuild after a 
disaster and to reimburse them for 
operating expenses incurred while 
preparing for and responding to

Title: Ocean Shipments Moving Under Export-Import Bank Financing. 
OMB Control Number: 2133–0013. 
Type of Request: Extension without

Abstract: MARAD uses this information collection to monitor 
compliance with the cargo preference 
laws by parties covered under PR 17 
and 46 U.S.C. 55304, compile annual 
information on EXIM Bank-financed 
shipments, and when applicable, 
provide for an informal grievance 
procedure, in the event there is a 
question or complaint pertaining to 
cargo preference matters. 
The monthly shipping reports, with 
substantiating documents provide the

EXIM Bank-financed cargoes that are 
transported on U.S.-flag vessels, 
recipient flag vessels, and on third-flag 
vessels according to the determinations 
and certifications of vessel non- 
availability that have been granted. The 
compilation of the statistics from the 
shipping reports forms the basis for 
determining compliance with PR 17 for 
each loan participant. This information 
is also provided to the EXIM Bank and 
is the nucleus for conducting annual 
reviews of the shipping activities of the 
EXIM Bank programs. 
MARAD uses the information 
collected as part of the Transparency 
Initiative with the EXIM Bank. MARAD 
also intends to use collected 
information to assist EXIM Bank 
shippers with finding suitable U.S.-flag 
vessels and resolving requests for 
certifications of non-availability. 
Respondents: All EXIM Bank loan and certain loan guarantee recipients and 
designated representatives charged with 
the responsibility of monthly and 
annual reporting. These can be a 
contractor, ocean transportation 
intermediary, supplier, etc.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Title: MARAD Mariner Preparedness Exercise Survey (Mariner PrepEx 
Survey). 
OMB Control Number: 2133–0550. 
Type of Request: Extension with 
change of a currently approved 
information collection. 
Abstract: The Mariner PrepEx Survey is a component of MARAD’s Mariner 
Preparedness Exercise Program. The 
survey will be conducted on a voluntary 
basis and provide vital information to 
the Ready Reserve Force (RRF) program. 
Periodic surveying is necessary in view 
of the dynamics that affect the RRF 
program, which include changes in the 
RRF fleet composition, readiness status, 
ship location, as well as changes to the 
seafaring manpower base. The survey is 
an integral part of the Mariner 
Preparedness Exercise Program and is 
designed to gauge mariner’s training and 
military experience levels, willingness 
to participate in time of national need, 
and awareness of working in a contested 
environment. 
Respondents: Merchant Mariners. Affected Public: Individuals and 
households. 
Estimated Number of Respondents: 
1,750. 
Estimated Number of Responses: 
1,750. 
Estimated Hours per Response: 0.0833 
(5 minutes). 
Annual Estimated Total Annual 
Burden Hours: 145.83/146 hours. 
Frequency of Response: Once 
Annually. 
A 60-day Federal Register Notice 
soliciting comments on this information 
collection was published on October 2, 
2025, (FR 47899, Vol. 90, No. 189). The 
posting received one non-substantive 
comment commending the minor 
changes to the survey and 
recommending a reduction of the 
reported public burden to ensure 
participation in the survey. In response, 
MARAD clarified that total respondents 
and burden hours were increased to 
reflect the potential expansion of the 
RRF fleet, which will require more 
mariners and crew aboard additional 
vessels. However, the total time taken to 
complete the survey (i.e., five (5) VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:11 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00179 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\23DEN1.SGM 23DEN1

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), Federal 
agencies must obtain approval from the 
OMB for each collection of information 
that they conduct or sponsor. 
‘‘Collection of information’’ is defined 
in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 
1320.3(c) to include agency requests or 
requirements, imposed on ten or more 
persons, that members of the public 
submit reports, keep records, or provide 
information to a third party. Section 
3506(c)(2)(A) of title 44 generally 
requires Federal agencies to provide a 
60-day notice in the Federal Register 
concerning each proposed collection of 
information, including each proposed 
extension of an existing collection of 
information, before submitting the 
collection to OMB for approval. To 
comply with this requirement, the OCC 
is publishing notice of the renewal of 
this collection. 
Title: ‘‘Appraisals of Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans.’’ OMB Control No.: 
1557–0313. 
Type of Review: Regular. 
Affected Public: Businesses or other 
for-profit. Description: This information collection relates to section 1471 of the 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act, which added 
a new section 129H to the Truth in 
Lending Act (TILA) establishing special 
appraisal requirements for ‘‘higher-risk 
mortgages.’’ For certain mortgages with 
an annual percentage rate that exceeds 
the average prime offer rate by a 
specified percentage, creditors must 
obtain an appraisal or appraisals 
meeting certain specified standards, 
provide applicants with a notification 
regarding the use of the appraisals, and 
give applicants a copy of the written 
appraisals used to evaluate real estate 
collateral. The statute permits the OCC 
to issue a rule to include exemptions 
from these requirements. 
The information collection 
requirements are found in 12 CFR 
34.203(c)(1), (c)(2), (d), (e) and (f). This

consumers and promote the safety and 
soundness of creditors making higher-

information is used by creditors to 
evaluate real estate collateral securing 
HPMLs subject to 12 CFR 34.203(c) and 
by consumers entering these

information are mandatory for creditors 
making HPMLs subject to 12 CFR part 
34, subpart G. 
Under 12 CFR 34.203(e) and (f), a 
creditor must, no later than the third 
business day after the creditor receives 
a consumer’s application for an HPML, 
provide the consumer with a disclosure 
that informs the consumer that the 
creditor may order an appraisal to 
determine the value of the property and 
charge the consumer for that appraisal, 
that the creditor will provide the 
consumer with a copy of any appraisal, 
and that the consumer may choose to 
have an additional appraisal conducted 
at the expense of the consumer. If a loan 
is an HPML subject to 12 CFR 34.203(c), 
then, under 12 CFR 34.203(c)(1) and (2), 
the creditor is required to obtain a 
written appraisal prepared by a certified 
or licensed appraiser who conducts a 
physical visit of the interior of the 
property that will secure the transaction 
(Written Appraisal). Under 12 CFR 
34.203(d)(1), a creditor is required to 
obtain an additional appraisal 
(Additional Written Appraisal) for an 
HPML that is subject to 12 CFR part 34, 
subpart G if: (1) the seller acquired the 
property securing the loan 90 or fewer 
days prior to the date of the consumer’s 
agreement to acquire the property and 
the price in the consumer’s agreement to 
acquire the property exceeds the seller’s 
acquisition price by more than 10 
percent; or (2) the seller acquired the 
property securing the loan 91 to 180 
days prior to the date of the consumer’s 
agreement to acquire the property and 
the price in the consumer’s agreement to 
acquire the property exceeds the seller’s 
acquisition price by more than 20 
percent. 
Under 12 CFR 34.203(d)(3) and (4), 
the Additional Written Appraisal must 
meet the requirements described in 12 
CFR 34.203(c)(1) and also include an 
analysis of: (1) the difference between 
the price at which the seller acquired 
the property and the price the consumer 
is obligated to pay to acquire the 
property; (2) changes in market 
conditions between the date the seller 
acquired the property and the date of 
the consumer’s agreement to acquire the 
property; and (3) any improvements 
made to the property between the date 
the seller acquired the property and the 
date of the consumer’s agreement to 
acquire the property. Under 12 CFR 
34.203(f), a creditor is required to 
provide the consumer with a copy of the 
Written Appraisal or Additional Written 
Appraisal, as applicable.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), Federal 
agencies must obtain approval from the 
OMB for each collection of information 
that they conduct or sponsor. 
‘‘Collection of information’’ is defined 
in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 
1320.3(c) to include agency requests or 
requirements, imposed on ten or more 
persons, that members of the public 
submit reports, keep records, or provide 
information to a third party. Section 
3506(c)(2)(A) of title 44 generally 
requires Federal agencies to provide a 
60-day notice in the Federal Register 
concerning each proposed collection of 
information, including each proposed 
extension of an existing collection of 
information, before submitting the 
collection to OMB for approval. To 
comply with this requirement, the OCC 
is publishing notice of the revision of 
this collection. 
Title: OCC Supplier Registration Form. 
OMB Control No.: 1557–0316. 
Type of Review: Regular. 
Affected Public: Businesses or other 
for-profit. 
Description: The OCC Supplier Registration Form is used to update and 
enhance an internal database of entities 
interested in doing business with the 
agency. This collection of information 
from interested suppliers facilitates 
early market research by allowing 
businesses to provide specific 
information to the OCC about 
capabilities that meet the OCC’s needs 
and in specific purchasing areas. 
The collection also allows the OCC to 
build a robust internal database of 
interested small businesses. In 
collaboration with the U.S. Department 
of the Treasury and U.S. Small Business 
Administration, the OCC establishes 
annual small business contracting goals. 
This collection helps ensure the 
maximum participation of small 
business concerns in the OCC’s 
procurement process. 
The OCC is revising the Supplier 
Registration Form by changing the 
format of the business classification 
information requested on the form; 
however, this revision will not impact 
the ability of suppliers to provide 
business classification information or 
otherwise continue submitting 
expressions of interest in doing business 
with the agency.

Title: Information sharing between government agencies and financial 
institutions. 
OMB Control Number: 1506–0049. 
Type of Review: Extension without 
change of a currently approved 
collection. 
Description: The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing 
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept 
and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 
(USA PATRIOT Act) charged the 
Department of the Treasury (Treasury) 
with developing regulations to facilitate 
information sharing among government 
entities and financial institutions for the 
purpose of combatting terrorism and 
money laundering.
1
In 2002, FinCEN 
published a final rule implementing the 
authority contained in section 314(a) of 
the USA PATRIOT Act (the Section 
314(a) Rule).
2
The rule required 
financial institutions, upon FinCEN’s 
request (a ‘‘Section 314(a) Request’’), to 
search their records to determine 
whether they have maintained an 
account or conducted a transaction with 
a specified individual, entity, or 
organization that a Federal law 
enforcement agency has certified is 
suspected, based on credible evidence, 
of engaging in terrorist activity or 
money laundering. The rule enables 
certain foreign law enforcement 
agencies, state and local law 
enforcement agencies, and FinCEN 
itself, on its own behalf and on behalf 
of appropriate components of Treasury, 
to initiate Section 314(a) Requests.
3
 
Before processing a request, FinCEN 
requires the requesting agency to certify 
that, in the case of money laundering, 
the matter is significant, and that the 
requesting agency has been unable to 
locate the information sought through 
traditional methods of investigation and 
analysis. The regulations implementing 
the rules are found at 31 CFR 1010.520. 
Form: Not applicable. Affected Public: Businesses or other 
for profit and non-profit institutions.

Excise Taxes (TTB REC 5110/06). 
OMB Control Number: 1513–00445. 
Type of Request: Extension without 
change of a currently approved

Description: Under chapter 51 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), distilled 
spirits produced or imported into the 
United States are subject to Federal 
excise tax, which is determined at the 
time the spirits are withdrawn from 
bond, and which is paid by return, 
subject to regulations prescribed by the 
Secretary of the Treasury (the 
Secretary). In addition, a credit may be 
taken against that tax for the portion of 
a distilled spirits product’s alcohol 
content derived from wine or flavors. 
The TTB regulations in 27 CFR parts 19 
and 26 require distilled spirits excise 
taxpayers to keep certain records in 
support of the information provided on 
their excise tax returns, including 
information on the distilled spirits 
removed from their premises and the 
products’ applicable tax rates. TTB uses 
the collected information to ensure that 
the relevant provisions of the IRC are 
appropriately applied, verify claims for 
refunds or remission of tax, and account 
for the transfer of certain distilled spirits 
excise taxes to the governments of 
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Type of Request: Extension without 
change of a currently approved 
collection. 
Description: Under the authority of the IRC at 26 U.S.C. 5122, the TTB 
regulations in 27 CFR part 31 require 
retail alcohol beverage dealers to keep 
records showing the quantities of all 
distilled spirits, wines, and beer 
received, including information on from 
whom and when the products were 
received. Those regulations also require 
dealers to keep records of all alcohol 
beverage sales of 20 or more wine 
gallons made to the same person at the 
same time. At the respondent’s 
discretion, those records may consist of 
usual and customary business records 
such as commercial invoices, unless the 
respondent prefers maintaining the 
information by other means, maintained 
at their place of business or at an 
alternate location under the dealer’s 
control approved by TTB. Additionally, 
under the IRC at 26 U.S.C. 5123, the 
TTB regulations require retail dealers to 
maintain those records for at least 3 
years, available for TTB inspection 
during business hours. TTB uses the 
required information to ensure that the 
relevant provisions of the IRC are 
appropriately applied. 
Form: None. Affected Public: Businesses or other 
for-profits. 
Estimated Number of Respondents: 
480,000. 
Frequency of Response: Once 
annually. 
Estimated Total Number of Annual 
Responses: 480,000. Estimated Time per Response: None. 
Estimated Total Annual Burden 
Hours: None. This information collection consists of usual and 
customary records kept by respondents 
during the normal course of business, 
regardless of any regulatory requirement 
to do so, and it therefore imposes no 
additional annual burden on its 
respondents, per the OMB regulations at 
5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2). 
3. Title: Records of Operations— 
Manufacturer of Tobacco Products or 
Processed Tobacco (TTB REC 5210/1). 
OMB Control Number: 1513–0068. 
Type of Request: Extension without 
change of a currently approved 
collection. 
Description: The IRC at 26 U.S.C. 5741 requires manufacturers of tobacco 
products, cigarette papers or tubes, or 
processed tobacco to keep records as the 
Secretary prescribes by regulation. 
Under that authority, the TTB 
regulations in 27 CFR part 40 require 
such manufacturers to keep daily 
records regarding products 
manufactured, removed, returned, 
consumed, transferred, destroyed, lost, 
or disclosed as shortages. Those 
regulations provide that manufacturers 
may use usual and customary 
commercial records, where possible, to 
keep and maintain the required data, 
which must be maintained for 3 years, 
subject to TTB inspection upon request. 
TTB uses the required information to 
ensure compliance with the tax 
provisions of the IRC regarding tobacco 
products and processed tobacco. 
Form: None. Affected Public: Businesses or other 
for-profits. 
Estimated Number of Respondents: 
235. 
Frequency of Response: Once 
annually. 
Estimated Total Number of Annual 
Responses: 235. Estimated Time per Response: 2

Hours: 470 hours. 4. Title: Tobacco Export Warehouse— 
Records of Operations. 
OMB Control Number: 1513–0070. 
Type of Request: Extension without 
change of a currently approved 
collection. 
Description: In general, chapter 52 of the IRC imposes Federal excise tax on 
all tobacco products and cigarette 
papers and tubes manufactured in, or 
imported into, the United States, while 
exempting such products removed for 
export, as well as all processed tobacco, 
from that tax. Export warehouses 
receive and store such non-taxpaid 
products until they are removed without 
payment of tax for export to a foreign 
country, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, or for consumption beyond the 
internal revenue laws of the United 
States. As authorized by the IRC at 26 
U.S.C. 5741, the TTB regulations in 27 
CFR part 44 require export warehouse 
proprietors to keep usual and customary 
business records showing the date, kind, 
quantity, and manufacturer of all 
tobacco products, cigarette papers and 
tubes, and processed tobacco received, 
removed, transferred, destroyed, lost, or 
returned to the manufacturer or to a 
customs bonded warehouse proprietor. 
TTB uses the collected information to 
ensure untaxpaid products are 
accounted for to detect diversion of 
untaxed products. 
Form: None. Affected Public: Businesses or other 
for-profits. 
Estimated Number of Respondents: 
65. 
Frequency of Response: Once 
annually. 
Estimated Total Number of Annual 
Responses: 65. Estimated Time per Response: None. 
Estimated Total Annual Burden 
Hours: None. This information collection consists of usual and 
customary records kept by respondents 
during the normal course of business, 
regardless of any regulatory requirement 
to do so, and it therefore imposes no 
additional annual burden on its 
respondents, per the OMB regulations at 
5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2). 
5. Title: Notices Relating to Payment 
of Firearms and Ammunition Excise Tax 
by Electronic Fund Transfer. 
OMB Control Number: 1513–0097. 
Type of Request: Extension without 
change of a currently approved 
collection. 
Description: Under the IRC at 26 U.S.C. 6302, TTB collects the firearms 
and ammunition excise tax imposed by 
26 U.S.C. 4181 on the basis of a return 
that taxpayers file on a quarterly basis. 
That section also authorizes the 
Secretary to issue regulations 
concerning the payment of taxes by 
electronic funds transfer (EFT). Under 
the TTB regulations in 27 CFR part 53, 
persons who elect to begin or 
discontinue payment of firearms and 
ammunition excise taxes by EFT must 
submit a written notice to TTB 
regarding such actions. TTB uses those 
notifications to administer the firearms 
and ammunition excise tax payment 
provisions related to the use of EFT. 
Form: None. 
Affected Public: Businesses or other 
for-profits. 
Estimated Number of Respondents: 
10.

AGENCY: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Department 
of Health and Human Services (HHS). 
ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule proposes to implement the Global Benchmark for 
Efficient Drug Pricing Model (‘‘GLOBE 
Model’’), a new Medicare payment 
model under section 1115A of the 
Social Security Act (the Act). The 
GLOBE Model would test whether a 
payment model that uses an alternative 
method for calculating Part B inflation 
rebate amounts for certain separately 
payable Part B drugs and biologicals 
products reduces costs for Medicare fee- 
for-service (FFS) beneficiaries and the 
Medicare program while preserving 
quality of care.

may be found at https://
www.regulations.gov/. 
I. Executive Summary and Background 
A. Executive Summary 
1. Purpose 
The purpose of this proposed rule is 
to propose the implementation and 
testing of a new mandatory model under 
the authority of the Centers for Medicare 
& Medicaid Services (CMS) Center for 
Medicare and Medicaid Innovation 
(CMMI) (Innovation Center). Section 
1115A of the Social Security Act (the 
Act) authorizes the Innovation Center to 
test innovative payment and service 
delivery models expected to reduce 
Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s 
Health Insurance Program (CHIP) 
expenditures while preserving or 
enhancing the quality of care furnished 
to the beneficiaries of such programs. 
2. Summary of Major Provisions 
a. Proposed GLOBE Model Drugs 
The proposed Global Benchmark for 
Efficient Drug Pricing Model (‘‘GLOBE 
Model’’) would focus on a set of Part B 
rebatable drugs that are single source 
drugs and sole source biological 
products that are furnished to a cohort 
of beneficiaries in the traditional 
Medicare program. The set of included 
drugs, as proposed in section II.B. of 
this proposed rule, would include 
certain Part B rebatable drugs as 
identified in 42 CFR 427.101 for the 
purpose of the Medicare Part B Drug 
Inflation Rebate Program and that meet 
the proposed definition of GLOBE 
Model drugs in proposed 42 CFR 
513.130. Drug selection (and removal, if 
applicable) for the model test would be 
determined by CMS based on the 
eligibility criteria and would not be 
subject to appeal. 
b. Proposed Defined Population and 
Intervention 
The proposed cohort of beneficiaries 
is described in section II.C. of this 
proposed rule. This cohort would be 
identified from approximately 25 
percent of beneficiaries who are 
enrolled in traditional Medicare Part B 
and meet certain criteria (as determined 
by CMS as set forth in proposed 42 CFR 
513.120). These beneficiaries must have 
traditional Medicare Part B as their 
primary payer, as defined by a 
beneficiary being enrolled in Medicare 
Part B fee-for-service (FFS), and must 
not be enrolled in a Medicare Advantage 
plan, section 1876 cost plan,
1
or section 
1833 healthcare prepayment plan.
2
 
Beneficiaries must not have other group 
health coverage that is a primary payer 
(such as employer-sponsored health 
insurance). Finally, beneficiaries must 
be identified by CMS for inclusion in 
the model (based on the beneficiary’s 
address of record at a certain point in 
time being within the GLOBE Model 
geographic areas) and must not be 
identified by CMS for inclusion in the 
comparison group or otherwise not 
eligible for inclusion. Medicare 
beneficiaries who are in the selected 
cohort, or ‘‘GLOBE Model 
beneficiaries,’’ would not be model 
participants
3
but would benefit from 
reduced coinsurance, as applicable, 
when they receive a GLOBE Model drug 
as described in section II.G.7. of this 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:53 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\23DEP2.SGM 23DEP2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260245 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules proposed rule. When a GLOBE Model 
beneficiary receives a GLOBE Model 
drug on a date of service where they are 
identified as a GLOBE Model 
beneficiary, separately payable claim 
lines for that service would be included 
in the calculation of GLOBE Model 
billing units as described in section 
II.G.4. of this proposed rule. Beneficiary 
selection for the model cohort and 
comparison group (and removal, if 
applicable) would be solely determined 
by CMS and would not be subject to 
appeal. Providers and suppliers who 
furnish GLOBE Model drugs to 
Medicare FFS beneficiaries who are in 
the model cohort would not be model 
participants and would continue to buy 
and bill for GLOBE Model drugs as 
usual and receive separate payment 
under Medicare Part B (if applicable). 
These providers and suppliers include, 
but may not be limited to, hospital 
outpatient departments, physician 
practices, ambulatory surgical centers, 
pharmacies enrolled as durable medical 
equipment (DME) suppliers. When the 
GLOBE Model reduced beneficiary 
coinsurance applies to units of GLOBE 
Model drugs furnished to Medicare Part 
B FFS beneficiaries who are included in 
the GLOBE Model beneficiary cohort, 
the provider or supplier would reduce 
the amount of coinsurance charged to 
the beneficiary and the portion of the 
Medicare Part B allowed amount that 
would be payable by Medicare Part B 
would be adjusted upwards. For 
example, if the Medicare Part B allowed 
amount under the GLOBE Model is $100 
and the GLOBE Model beneficiary 
coinsurance percentage is reduced to 10 
percent (instead of the usual 20 
percent), the Medicare Part B program 
payment to the provider or supplier 
would be adjusted upward and would 
be $90 (instead of the usual $80) and the 
beneficiary coinsurance financial 
responsibility would be $10. 
c. Proposed Manufacturer Participation 
The proposed GLOBE Model would 
require mandatory participation for all 
manufacturers (as defined in 42 CFR 
427.20) of Part B rebatable drugs that are 
also GLOBE Model drugs (as identified 
in proposed 42 CFR 513.130 and 
discussed in section II.B. of this 
proposed rule). When Part B rebatable 
drugs subject to the GLOBE Model are 
furnished to Medicare FFS beneficiaries 
who are in the model cohort, 
manufacturers that are GLOBE Model 
participants would pay GLOBE Model 
rebates to the Medicare Part B account 
in the Federal Supplementary Medical 
Insurance Trust Fund if the amount 
specified in section 1847A(i)(3)(A)(ii)(I) 
of the Act for the GLOBE Model drug 
exceeds a benchmark amount that 
would be based on available 
international drug pricing information 
(as described in section II.G. of this 
proposed rule), which would not be less 
than any rebates owed under the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program. The total GLOBE Model rebate 
amount would only apply to certain 
units of the GLOBE Model drugs (as 
identified in proposed 42 CFR 513.520) 
and would be solely determined by 
CMS and would not be subject to 
appeal. Manufacturers would have the 
opportunity to submit a Suggestion of 
Error if the manufacturer believes that 
there is a mathematical error or errors to 
be corrected. 
d. Model Purpose 
The intent of the proposed GLOBE 
Model is to test an innovative payment 
model that modifies the Part B inflation 
rebate amount for GLOBE Model drugs 
using international drug pricing 
information to identify a benchmark 
that reflects prices paid in a set of 
economically comparable countries (as 
discussed in section II.G.1.e. of this 
proposed rule), which CMS expects 
would reduce program expenditures for 
Medicare Part B while preserving or 
enhancing beneficiaries’ quality of care. 
As described in section II.G.2. of this 
proposed rule, CMS proposes that the 
model test would include two 
approaches for identifying a benchmark 
amount for the modified rebate 
calculation—using differently sourced 
international drug pricing information 
and different calculations—and the 
model evaluation would assess the 
impacts of testing these different 
approaches for identifying a benchmark 
amount for the modified rebate 
calculation. One approach, described in 
section II.G.2.a. of this proposed rule 
(Method I), would use existing 
international drug pricing information 
to identify a benchmark based on an 
estimation of the lowest international 
price among the set of economically 
comparable countries, which may be 
tied to pricing data that represent list, 
invoice, ex-manufacturer sales, other 
prices, or a combination of such prices 
as available in commercially-available 
data sources. The other approach, 
described in section II.G.2.b. of this 
proposed rule (Method II), would use 
voluntary manufacturer-submitted 
international drug net pricing data to 
estimate a benchmark based on an 
average international price among the 
set of economically comparable 
countries, which would reflect net 
prices realized by a manufacturer. 
In this proposed rule, we propose to 
test the GLOBE Model in a manner that 
captures all applicable billing units for 
all separately payable Medicare Part B 
FFS claims for GLOBE Model drugs that 
are furnished to Medicare Part B FFS 
beneficiaries who are in the model 
cohort (on the date of service) and that 
are paid under the GLOBE Model for 
dates of service during a performance 
year and for which the GLOBE Model 
beneficiary coinsurance and adjusted 
payments to providers and suppliers 
could apply. For purposes of calculating 
the total GLOBE Model rebate amount, 
applicable billing units would be 
identified by CMS several months after 
the end of a calendar quarter (as 
described in section II.G. of this 
proposed rule) and additional time is 
necessary for calculations of rebate 
amounts and creating invoices. This 
means that GLOBE Model test processes 
for claims processing, data collection, 
invoicing, payment of GLOBE Model 
rebates, and reconciliation would occur 
concurrently with and continue after the 
end of a performance year and 
subsequent years after the last 
performance year. 
e. Proposed Model Performance Period 
The proposed GLOBE Model would 
have a 7-year test period that includes 
5 performance years, beginning October 
1, 2026, and ending September 30, 2031, 
during which the GLOBE Model 
beneficiary coinsurance and adjusted 
payments to providers and suppliers 
could apply and monitoring activities 
would occur, and 7 payment years, 
beginning October 1, 2026, and ending 
September 30, 2033, during which CMS 
would calculate, invoice, collect, and 
reconcile the GLOBE Model rebates for 
a performance year. The model 
evaluation would encompass the 7-year 
test period. 
f. Proposed Model Waivers 
We believe it would be necessary to 
waive certain requirements of title XVIII 
of the Act and related program 
requirements codified in regulations 
solely for purposes of carrying out the 
testing of the GLOBE Model under 
section 1115A(b) of the Act. 
Specifically, as further described in 
section II.O. of this proposed rule, we 
propose to waive provisions in section 
1847A(i), 1833(a), and 1833(t) of the Act 
to the extent necessary to permit testing 
of an alternative rebate calculation for 
certain units of GLOBE Model drugs and 
collect GLOBE Model rebate amounts. 
We propose to issue waivers using the 
waiver authority under section 
1115A(d)(1) of the Act. Each of the 
proposed waivers is discussed in detail 
in section II.O. of this proposed rule.

We propose to codify the 
requirements of the GLOBE Model at 42 
CFR part 513. We propose at § 513.800 
that should any provision of the 
proposed part 513 be held invalid or 
unenforceable by its terms, or as applied 
to any person or circumstance, such 
provisions would be severable from the 
remainder of part 513 and the invalidity 
or unenforceability would not affect the 
remainder of the provisions of part 513. 
For example, should the proposed 
alternate rebate calculation payment 
methodology in this proposed rule be 
deemed invalid or unenforceable, the 
underlying obligation under current 
statute will continue. We seek comment 
on our proposed severability policies. 
3. Summary of Costs and Benefits 
In section IV. of this proposed rule, 
we set forth a detailed analysis of the 
regulatory and Federalism impacts that 
the proposed GLOBE Model would have 
on affected entities and beneficiaries. As 
detailed in section II.A. of this proposed 
rule, this proposed rule would establish 
a 7-year GLOBE Model alternative 
payment test for certain separately 
payable Medicare Part B rebatable drugs 
furnished in the outpatient setting to 
Medicare FFS beneficiaries in the model 
cohort and that are paid under the 
GLOBE Model. Tables 13, 14, and 15 in 
section IV.D. of this proposed rule 
display the estimated overall impact of 
the proposed GLOBE Model on the 
Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
We estimate that the GLOBE Model 
would result in overall savings of $11.9 
billion in Medicare Part B net spending 
during the 7-year model, inclusive of 
$8.4 billion in Medicare Part B FFS, 7.5 
billion in Medicare Advantage (MA) 
savings, and $4 billion in premium 
offset impacts. In this estimate, we 
assume manufacturer behavioral 
changes and beneficiary utilization 
changes, as described in section IV. of 
this proposed rule. We estimate savings 
for the MA program of $7.5 billion due 
to the way CMS calculates MA rates 
using Medicare FFS claims, which 
would include claims paid under the 
GLOBE Model beginning with rate 
setting for 2028, and savings for the 
Medicaid program of around $1.0 
billion, of which roughly $0.7 billion 
would be federal savings and roughly 
$0.3 billion would be state savings.
4
 
When annualized over the 7-year 
period, we estimate that the GLOBE 
Model would result in overall cost 
savings in Medicare Part B FFS net 
spending of approximately $2.3 billion 
at both the 3 and 7 percent rates of 
discount. 
B. Background 
A 2024 report from the Office of the 
Assistant Secretary for Planning and 
Evaluation (ASPE) revealed that U.S. 
prices for U.S. originator drugs were 422 
percent higher than other countries.
56
A 
number of studies have also 
demonstrated observable differences in 
pricing dynamics of single source
7
 
versus multi-source,
8
where multi- 
source drugs and biological products 
typically have higher price concessions 
and manufacturer discounts than single 
source drugs and sole source
91011
 
biologics. 
Recent CMS analysis of claims data 
for 2024 shows that total Medicare 
spending is at $70.71 billion, with more 
than two-thirds ($46.38 billion) of this 
spend being attributed to Medicare Part 
B rebatable drugs. Research has shown 
Medicare Part B drug spending is also 
concentrated among a small number of 
drugs. In 2021, the top 20 drugs 
accounted for over half of total Medicare 
Part B FFS drug spending, with the top 
10 representing 40 percent.
12
Notably, 
all 20 drugs were biological products. 
To discourage drug manufacturers 
from increasing drug prices faster than 
the rate of inflation and to improve 
access to affordable treatments for 
Medicare beneficiaries, the Inflation 
Reduction Act of 2022 created the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program. If drug manufacturers raise 
prices for certain drugs faster than the 
rate of inflation for a calendar quarter 
beginning with the first quarter of 2023, 
manufacturers must pay a rebate to the 
Medicare Part B account in the Federal 
Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust 
Fund and Medicare lowers beneficiary 
coinsurance amounts for applicable 
drugs accordingly. 
Medicare Part B FFS drug spending
13
 
has grown by 85.8 percent ($18.7 
billion)
14
from 2014 to 2021 with the 
standard monthly Medicare Part B 
premium for beneficiaries increasing by 
41.5 percent ($104.90
15
to $148.50
16
). 
Based on the increasing Medicare Part B 
FFS and beneficiary drug spending, we 
propose to test a model that reduces 
Medicare Part B FFS drug spending and 
beneficiary coinsurance amounts using 
international drug pricing information 
as a benchmark to test an alternative 
Part B inflation rebate amount 
calculation for certain single source 
drugs and sole source biological 
products that would reduce Medicare 
program expenditures while preserving 
or enhancing quality of care. 
The pace of growth in drug prices 
varies across disease categories. A report 
by the Healthcare Distribution Alliance 
(HDA) Research Foundation, showed 
that drugs classified in immunology, 
oncology, rheumatology, endocrinology 
and ophthalmology are among the top 
20 therapeutic classes based on 
spending or prescriptions volume in the 
United States and that most of these 
categories have shown notable growth

This trend is 
also observed in Medicare Part B FFS 
drugs, where these five therapeutic 
classes represent at least $24 billion in 
Medicare Part B FFS allowed charges in 
2024.
18 19 20
 
Increasingly high drug costs limit 
access to care and treatment which in 
turn results in complications that can 
lead to worse health outcomes and 
premature death. This results in 
increased medical spending to treat 
patients’ conditions and potentially 
avoidable expenditures for all payers, 
including CMS.
21
Results from recent 
surveys revealed that many Americans, 
including Medicare beneficiaries, face 
significant financial burden of care that 
results in skipping or rationing 
medication due to cost.
22
A survey 
conducted in June 2025 showed that 
one quarter of adults reported not filling 
their prescription in 2024 because of 
cost; among those who had taken a 
prescription, one in three stated they 
did not fill at least one prescription 
because of the cost.
23
Financial toxicity, 
or the negative impact that the monetary 
burden of medical care can have on 
patients’ well-being, fiscal security, and 
overall health,
24
can be most 
pronounced among the elderly 
population and among patients where 
the cost of treatment is high and with 
low income. One in four adults taking 
prescriptions report difficulty affording 
their medication, including 40 percent 
of those with household income of less 
than $40,000 per year.
25
A separate 
survey conducted concluded that about 
4 in 10 older adults with Medicare 
reported problems accessing healthcare 
because of its costs, and that 14 percent 
of Medicare beneficiaries stated they 
skipped taking or sometimes did not 
even fill their prescription because of 
the expense.
26
Studies show that 
Medicare patients with cancer and 
certain chronic conditions are more 
likely to report cost-related medication 
non-adherence (that is, not taking 
medications as prescribed or indicated 
by a physician due to cost).
27 28 29
 
Studies have also shown that the 
impacts on access to care due to costs 
can be significant. A literature review 
concluded that annual costs of 
medication non-adherence are up to 
$290 billion, that 10 percent of 
hospitalizations in adults are attributed 
to medication non-adherence, with the 
typical non-adherent patient requiring 
three extra visits per year leading to 
$2,000 in increased treatment costs per 
year.
30
This paper also found that 
cancer patients experience more than 
double the cost variation compared to 
other disease groups. Further, a 2020 
report estimated that up to 112,000 
seniors could die prematurely because 
drug prices are so high that they cannot 
afford their medication, and that 
Medicare could be spending $17.7 
billion annually on avoidable medical 
spending because of complications 
associated with cost-related medication 
non-adherence.

1. Medicare Part B Drug Benefit 
a. Medicare Payment for Separately 
Payable Under Medicare Part B Drugs 
The majority of drugs covered under 
Medicare Part B generally fall into three 
categories: drugs furnished incident to a 
physicians’ service which are not 
usually self-administered by the patient 
(section 1861(s)(2)(A) and (B) of the 
Act), drugs administered via a covered 
item of durable medical equipment 
(DME) (section 1861(s)(6) of the Act), 
and drugs specified by statute (for 
example, vaccines (section 
1861(s)(10)(A) and (B) of the Act), oral 
cancer drugs (section 1861(s)(2)(Q) of 
the Act), oral antiemetics (section 
1861(s)(2)(T) of the Act), and 
immunosuppressive therapy (section 
1861(s)(2)(J) of the Act)). 
Many drugs payable under Medicare 
Part B are administered via injection or 
infusion in a physician office, a Hospital 
Outpatient Department (HOPD), and 
certain other outpatient settings, such as 
ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), and, 
when Medicare allows separate 
payment for these drugs, the payment 
limit is typically based on the 
methodology described in section 
1847A of the Act. Payment for these 
drugs does not include payment for 
administration; payment for drug 
administration services is made in 
accordance with the applicable payment 
policy for the setting in which the drug 
was furnished, such as the Physician 
Fee Schedule (PFS), the Hospital 
Outpatient Prospective Payment System 
(OPPS), or the Ambulatory Surgical 
Center Payment System. Medicare Part 
B also allows separate payment for 
drugs in less common situations such as 
osteoporosis drugs furnished by a home 
health agency, and when a beneficiary 
does not have benefits available under 
the Medicare Part A program. 
The payment methodology described 
in section 1847A of the Act is generally 
based on the volume-weighted average 
sales price (ASP) for all National Drug 
Codes (NDCs) that are assigned to a 
Healthcare Common Procedure Coding 
System (HCPCS) Level II code for the 
drug plus an add-on percentage. For 
most HCPCS Level II codes, the add-on 
percentage is 6 percent except during 
the initial sales period when ASP is not 
yet available, for certain qualifying

Qualifying biosimilar biological products are 
defined under section 1847A(b)(8)(B)(iii) of the Act 
and, during the applicable 5-year period, must have 
an ASP that is not more than the ASP of the 
reference biological product for a calendar quarter 
to qualify for an add-on amount equal to 8 percent 
of the payment amount calculated under section 
1847A(b)(4) of the Act for the reference biological 
product.

biosimilar biological products, and in 
certain circumstances specified within 
section 1847A(d)(3)(C) of the Act. When 
ASP is not yet available and the 
wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) is 
used, the add-on is 3 percent. Section 
11403 of the Inflation Reduction Act of 
2022 requires a temporary, 5-year 
increase for qualifying biosimilar 
biological products (as defined in 
section 1847A(b)(8)(iii) of the Act) that 
have an ASP less than the ASP of the 
reference biological product. In these 
cases, the add-on is 8 percent of the 
reference biological product’s ASP. 
Following the applicable five-year 
period (as described in section 
1847A(b)(8)(ii) of the Act) for these 
qualifying biosimilar biological 
products, the add-on percentage reverts 
back to 6 percent of the reference 
biological product’s ASP. 
The volume-weighted ASP for a 
HCPCS Level II code is calculated by 
CMS quarterly using manufacturer- 
submitted data on sales to all purchasers 
(with limited exceptions as articulated 
in section 1847A(c)(2) of the Act,
32
such 
as sales at nominal charge and sales 
exempt from Medicaid best price)
33
 
with manufacturer rebates, discounts, 
and price concessions included in the 
ASP calculation (that is, the sales price 
is net of these rebates, discounts, and 
price concessions). The ASP-based 
payment limit that Medicare pays for a 
separately payable Medicare Part B FFS 
drug claim does not vary based on the 
exact price an individual provider or 
supplier pays to acquire the drug. This 
payment methodology may create an 
incentive for the use of more expensive 
drugs. Although the statute does not 
specifically state what the add-on 
represents, as noted in the MedPAC 
report,
34
it may be needed to account for 
handling and overhead costs and 
additional mark-up in U.S. distribution 
channels that are not captured in the 
manufacturer-reported ASP. 
Currently, under Medicare Part B, 
beneficiary cost-sharing
35
is generally 
20 percent of the Medicare-allowed 
amount. The term ‘‘Medicare-allowed 
amount’’ means the maximum amount 
that a provider or supplier would be 
paid for a covered health care service or 
drug. However, for items and services 
paid under the OPPS, beneficiaries are 
only financially responsible for a 
copayment amount up to the amount of 
the inpatient hospital deductible.
36
 
Medicare pays for the remaining portion 
of the Medicare allowed amount.
37
 
b. Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program 
Section 11101 of the Inflation 
Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) (Pub. L. 
117–169, enacted August 16, 2022) 
established requirements under which 
drug manufacturers must pay Part B 
inflation rebate amounts if they raise 
their prices for certain drugs payable 
under Medicare Part B faster than the 
rate of inflation. Specifically, section 
11101 of the IRA amended section 
1847A of the Act by adding new 
subsection (i) which establishes a 
requirement for drug manufacturers to 
pay rebates into the Medicare Part B 
account in the Federal Supplementary 
Medical Insurance Trust Fund for Part 
B rebatable drugs for each calendar 
quarter beginning on or after January 1, 
2023, if the amount specified, as 
determined under section 
1847A(i)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act exceeds the 
inflation-adjusted payment amount, 
which is calculated as set forth in 
section 1847A(i)(3)(C) of the Act. The 
IRA also provides for an adjustment to 
the beneficiary coinsurance amount in 
cases where the price of a Part B 
rebatable drug increases faster than the 
rate of inflation such that the 
beneficiary coinsurance is calculated 
based on the lower inflation-adjusted 
payment amount instead of the 
applicable payment amount, resulting in 
a coinsurance percentage that is equal to 
20 percent of the inflation-adjusted 
payment amount as described in section 
1847A(i)(3)(C) of the Act for a calendar 
quarter. Section 1847A(i)(2) of the Act 
defines a ‘‘Part B rebatable drug,’’ in 
part, as a single source drug or 
biological product (as defined in section 
1847A(c)(6)(D) of the Act), including a 
biosimilar biological product (as defined 
in section 1847A(c)(6)(H) of the Act), for 
which payment is made under Medicare 
Part B. Certain product categories are 
excluded from the definition of a Part B 
rebatable drug pursuant to 42 CFR 
427.101(b). Currently excluded product 
categories include: (1) qualifying 
biosimilar biological products;
38
(2) 
products with historically excepted 
grouped billing and payment codes; (3) 
products billed under a ‘‘not otherwise 
classified’’ (NOC) code; (4) 
radiopharmaceutical drugs and 
biological products; (5) skin substitutes; 
(6) drugs with average total allowed 
charges under the applicable threshold 
; (7) certain vaccines and other 
products;
39
and (8) generic drugs.
40
The 
applicable threshold specified in section 
1847A(i)(2) of the Act was equal to $100 
for applicable calendar quarters in 2023. 
Thereafter, CMS calculates the 
applicable threshold as equal to the 
unrounded applicable threshold 
calculated for the prior calendar year 
increased by the percentage increase in 
the consumer price index for all urban 
customers (CPI–U) for the 12-month 
period ending with June of the previous 
year, rounded to the nearest multiple of 
$10.
41
 
For each calendar quarter beginning 
on or after January 1, 2023, the 
manufacturer of a Part B rebatable drug 
is required, for such drug, not later than 
30 days after date of receipt (as defined 
in 42 CFR 427.505) of the Rebate Report 
from CMS, to pay a rebate into the 
Medicare Part B account in the Federal 
Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust 
Fund if the amount specified in section 
1847A(i)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act exceeds the 
inflation-adjusted payment amount 
(calculated as set forth in section 
1847A(i)(3)(C) of the Act) for an 
applicable calendar quarter. With 
respect to invoicing manufacturers for 
the rebate amount owed, under section 
1847A(i)(1) of the Act, CMS must report 
rebate amounts to each manufacturer of 
a Part B rebatable drug no later than 6 
months after the end of each calendar 
quarter, except that for calendar quarters 
beginning in 2023 and 2024, CMS had 
until September 30, 2025, to invoice 
manufacturers for rebates. In the CY

The average annual growth in number of 
Medicare Part B FFS beneficiaries was less than 2.5 
percent from 2014 to 2021, so the change in 
Medicare Part B beneficiaries does not fully account 
for the average annual growth in Medicare Part B 
drug spending (9.2 percent annual growth). Instead, 
the increase during this period is more fully 
explained by increases in the prices of drugs, 
introduction of new drugs, changes in drug 
utilization, and changes in the mix of drugs than 
by increases in Medicare enrollment.

to 
implement section 11101 of the IRA, 
CMS codified these requirements and 
established other policies at 42 CFR part 
427. In the CY 2026 PFS final rule (90 
FR 49733 through 49739),
43
CMS 
adopted certain limited modifications to 
the policies for the Medicare 
Prescription Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program set forth in part 427 under title 
42, chapter IV of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) for Part B. For 
example, at 42 CFR 427.302(c)(5) 
described how CMS identifies the 
payment amount benchmark quarter in 
certain instances and the calculation for 
the Part B rebate amount in such 
instances. 
c. Medicare Drug Price Negotiation 
Program 
Sections 11001 and 11002 of IRA 
establish the Medicare Drug Price 
Negotiation Program (hereinafter the 
‘‘Negotiation Program’’) to negotiate 
maximum fair prices (MFPs)
44
for 
certain high expenditure, single source 
drugs and biological products. The 
requirements for this program are 
described in sections 1191 through 1198 
of the Act, as added by sections 11001 
and 11002 of the IRA. Additionally, on 
July 4, 2025, the Working Families Tax 
Cuts Act (Pub. L. 119–21) was signed 
into law. Section 71203 of the Working 
Families Tax Cuts Act expanded 
protections for certain orphan drugs in 
section 1192(e) of the Act. Drugs 
payable under Medicare Part B are 
eligible to be selected for negotiation for 
initial price applicability year 2028. 
2. Medicare and Beneficiary Spending 
a. Historical Trending 
An Issue Brief from ASPE evaluated 
Medicare Part B total spending and fee- 
for-service (FFS) drug allowed charges 
from 2014 to 2021.
45
Medicare Part B 
total spending increased from $265.9 
billion in 2014 to $405.5 billion in 2021, 
representing an increase of $139.6 
billion. Medicare Part B FFS drug 
allowed charges increased from $21.8 
billion in 2014 to $40.5 billion in 2021, 
an increase of $16.4 billion. While total 
spending and drug allowed charges 
have both increased significantly, 
Medicare Part B FFS drug allowed 
charges have seen higher spending 
growth. In 2014, Medicare Part B FFS 
drug allowed charges represented about 
12.1 percent of Medicare Part B FFS 
spending but grew to approximately 20 
percent in 2021.
46
 
The same report also found that 
between 2014 and 2021, Medicare Part 
B FFS drug spending per enrollee grew 
on ‘‘average at 9.2 percent annually’’ 
more than three times the rate of 
Medicare Part D (2.6 percent) and nearly 
four times as high as the rate of per 
capita annual prescription drug 
spending (2.4 percent). Medicare Part B 
FFS drug spending was also 
concentrated among a few drugs where 
the top 20 drugs accounted for greater 
than 50 percent of drug spending in 
2021 and the top 10 drugs accounted for 
40 percent of drug spending in the same 
period. When comparing biological 
products to non-biologicals, biological 
products accounted for 89 percent of the 
Medicare Part B FFS drug spending 
growth between 2008 and 2021 and 79 
percent of Medicare Part B FFS drug 
spending in 2021. When reviewing 
Medicare Part B FFS spending on multi- 
source drugs and biological products in 
2021, generic drugs
47
accounted for 
only 2 percent of spending and only 3 
of the top 20 drugs by spend
48
(all 
biological products) were multi-source. 
Therefore, the majority of Medicare Part 
B FFS drug expenditures in 2021 were 
attributable to single source drugs and 
sole source biological products. 
An ASPE report evaluating Medicare 
Part B FFS spending from 2018 to 2023 
estimated biosimilar biological product 
competition (multi-source biological 
products) reduced spending by $12.9 
billion, a 31 percent decrease compared 
to projected spending if only the 
reference biological product existed.
49
 
Savings after biosimilar biological 
product competition entered the market 
were driven by a mix of beneficiary 
switches to a lower-priced biosimilar 
biological product and price reductions 
in the reference biological products. 
It is also important to note that the 
number of enrollees for Medicare Part B 
FFS has decreased (8.8 percent) between 
2016 to 2021 (34 million to 31 
million),
50
while Medicare Part B FFS 
drug allowed charges has increased (47 
percent) for the same time period.
51
 
Therefore, this increase in Medicare Part 
B FFS spending for drugs during this 
period is likely explained more by 
increases in the prices of drugs, 
introduction of new drugs,
52
changes in 
utilization of drugs, and changes in the 
mix of drugs for those beneficiaries who 
received them more so than the changes 
in Medicare Part B enrollment.
53
 
b. Impact on Premiums, Beneficiaries, 
and Taxpayers 
Medicare Part B is funded by 
premiums paid by beneficiaries and 
general federal revenues. Total Medicare 
Part B Premium amounts increased from 
$74 billion in 2016 to $113 billion in 
2021, representing an increase of $39

54
While this increase in total 
Medicare Part B premiums is partially 
attributable to the increase in 
beneficiaries from 52 million to 58 
million,
55
there was also a rise in 
premium amount per enrollee from 
$1,423 in 2016 to $1,942 in 2021. A 
research study found the 2024 Medicare 
Part B premiums accounted for more 
than 10 percent of annual per capita 
income for 12 percent of Medicare Part 
B beneficiaries—approximately 7.4 
million of the 61 million Medicare Part 
B beneficiaries.
56
The rise in premiums 
is partly due to projected costs for new 
drugs, price changes for health care 
services, new technologies, and 
assumed utilization increases.
57 58 59
 
In addition to a monthly premium, 
Medicare Part B FFS beneficiaries 
typically need to cover 20 percent of the 
cost of a Medicare Part B drug once their 
Medicare Part B deductible is met. 
Medicare Part B FFS does not have an 
out-of-pocket maximum, whereas other 
forms of coverage such as MA plans and 
Medigap policies may have a maximum. 
While the IRA has reduced beneficiary 
coinsurance for certain Medicare Part B 
drugs whose prices have risen faster 
than inflation, beneficiaries may 
continue to experience significant cost 
sharing as overall Medicare Part B FFS 
spending has increased. As previously 
discussed, this increase is likely driven 
by high overall prices and the 
introduction of new drugs.
60 61
 
Further, as discussed earlier in this 
section, increasing high drug costs limit 
access to care and treatment which in 
turn results in complications that can 
lead to worse health outcomes and 
increased medical spending. For 
example, though not specific to 
Medicare Part B, the national healthcare 
expenditure (NHE) out-of-pocket (OOP) 
spending increased by 25.5 percent 
($102.7 billion) between 2019 to 2023.
62
 
High OOP costs have been shown to 
reduce medication adherence. A study 
on specialty drugs found that 30 percent 
of new cancer drug prescriptions went 
unfilled among patients without low- 
income subsidies, while another 
showed that 7 percent of adults 65 and 
older skipped or did not take their 
medications as prescribed because of 
cost.
63 64
Research has also found 
multiple indications of worse health 
status were associated with a higher 
likelihood of cost-related nonadherence 
to medications.
65
 
The second source for Medicare Part 
B funding comes from general federal 
revenues, which taxpayers primarily 
finance. General revenues fund 
approximately 75 percent of Medicare 
Part B expenditures, with beneficiary 
premiums accounting for the remaining 
25 percent of projected expenditures.
66
 
Historical trend analysis on Medicare 
Part B spending has shown an increase 
in annual federal revenue contribution 
from $235.6 billion in 2016 to $386.0 
billion in 2024, illustrating the growth 
in general federal revenues in Medicare 
Part B financing.
67
 
c. Relative High Price of Medicare Part 
B Drugs 
Research from ASPE and RAND 
provides comparative data on U.S. 
prescription drug prices relative to 32 
other Organisation for Economic Co- 
operation and Development (OECD) 
countries.
68
These studies examine 
pricing patterns of prescription drugs 
and present findings on how U.S. 
prescription drug costs compare to 
international benchmarks. OECD 
countries are generally developed, high- 
income nations, making them suitable 
comparators for evaluating drug prices. 
ASPE funded research published in 
July 2022 indicated that U.S. 
prescription drugs prices exceeded 
those of non-U.S. OECD countries 
combined by 256 percent
69
using 2018 
data.
70
In 2024, the study was updated 
with pricing information from 2022 and 
showed an even larger gap of 278 
percent compared to non-U.S. OECD 
countries combined.
71
When comparing 
the U.S. against individual G7 
countries,
72
the price differential ranged 
from 229 percent higher than Canada to 
347 percent higher than Japan. 
This analysis reveals even larger 
pricing differences when examining

An international originator is an original 
biological product or drug approved or licensed in 
a non-U.S. country under that non U.S. country’s 
regulatory framework under a pathway similar to 
351(k) of the PHS Act or approved under a pathway 
similar to section 505(c) of the FD&A Act in the 
U.S. Individual countries differ in the regulatory

78
U.S. originator drugs are the original biologics 
and drugs developed and licensed or approved via 
section 351(a) of the Public Health Services Act or 
submitted under section 505(b) and approved under 
section 505(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). U.S. originator drugs are 
also sometimes called brand name drugs, reference 
listed drug, or reference products. 
originator drugs separately. U.S. 
originator drug prices are 422 percent 
higher than non-U.S. OECD countries 
combined. Among individual G7 
countries, the difference between U.S. 
and the international prices ranged from 
324 percent higher than Canada to 464 
percent higher than Japan. These data 
points indicate there are significant cost 
differences within the global 
pharmaceutical market for U.S. 
originator drugs and international 
originator drugs.
73
 
In contrast, the unbranded generic 
drug market, not including biologics 
such as biosimilar biological products, 
shows different pricing dynamics. The 
same study showed U.S. unbranded 
generic pricing was 67 percent of the 
average price among non-U.S. OECD 
countries. The comparison of U.S. 
prices to individual G7 countries for 
unbranded generic drugs shows pricing 
that is 39 percent lower than Canada 
and 46 percent lower than Germany. 
This indicates that pricing patterns vary 
significantly between originator drugs 
and generic drugs in the U.S. market. 
A separate ASPE analysis examined 
Medicare Part B drugs. The study 
evaluated drug prices for the top 50 Part 
B drugs against non-U.S. OECD 
countries using 2018 drug spending 
data.
74
Although this report included 
only 50 drugs, those drugs accounted for 
80 percent of the total 2018 Medicare 
Part B drug spending. The analysis 
found that U.S. prices were 211 percent 
higher than other OECD countries on 
average.
75
In G7 country comparisons, 
the difference between the U.S. and 
individual countries for U.S. originators 
and international originators drugs 
ranged from 148 percent higher than 
Japan to 225 percent higher than 
France.
76
 
The research findings indicate that 
U.S. prices used to calculate ASP rates 
for Medicare Part B FFS payment limits 
are different from prices in international 
comparator countries. This price 
differential has led to recurring policy 
discussions about potential approaches 
for reducing Medicare Part B drug and 
biological product spending by 
reviewing international prices. Research 
from the Brookings Institute indicates 
that many non-U.S. OECD countries use 
international reference pricing as a 
benchmark when negotiating with 
prescription drug manufacturers, 
demonstrating that this practice is 
established among manufacturers.
77
 
The data shows that U.S. prescription 
drug prices, particularly for U.S. 
originator drugs,
78
exceed those found 
in other OECD countries. In addition, 
prior studies on generic drug pricing in 
the U.S. have shown that generic drug 
prices generally compare to or fall 
below international comparisons; 
suggesting that high overall drug costs 
are primarily driven by originator, 
single source drugs or sole source 
biological products. Based on the high 
spending by Medicare Part FFS and 
Medicare Part B beneficiaries on single 
source drugs and sole source biological 
products, in this proposed rule, we 
propose the GLOBE Model to test the 
impact of using international drug 
pricing information as a benchmark for 
an alternative Part B inflation rebate 
amount calculation for a subset of 
Medicare Part B rebatable drugs (certain 
single source drugs and sole source 
biological products) on Medicare 
program expenditures and quality of 
care. 
II. Provisions of the Proposed 
Regulations 
In this proposed rule, we propose our 
policies for the GLOBE Model, 
including the general framework for 
implementing and evaluating the 
GLOBE Model and model-specific 
parameters, requirements, and 
definitions. We note that section 
1115A(b) of the Act gives the Secretary 
discretion in the design of models. In 
accordance with section 1115A(a)(3) of 
the Act, through this proposed rule, 
CMS seeks input from interested parties 
and welcomes comments on the 
proposed GLOBE Model. 
The proposed model-specific 
parameters, requirements, and 
definitions are described in subsections 
of this section of this proposed rule and 
we propose to codify them at proposed 
42 CFR 513. In addition, for purposes of 
this proposed rule and the proposed 
GLOBE Model, we propose that the 
following terms would have the same 
meaning as set forth for the Medicare 
Part B Drug Inflation Rebate Program in 
42 CFR 427.20: allowed charges, 
applicable calendar quarter, average 
sales price, billing and payment code, 
billing unit, biosimilar biological 
product, final action claim, inflation- 
adjusted payment amount, 
manufacturer, National Drug Code 
(NDC), Not Otherwise Classified (NOC) 
code, Part B rebatable drug, single 
source drug, specified amount, and unit 
(with respect to a Part B rebatable drug). 
We propose that the following terms 
would have the same meaning as set 
forth in 42 CFR 427.400: currently in 
shortage, drug shortage or shortage, 
natural disaster, other unique or 
unexpected event, plasma-derived 
product, and severe supply chain 
disruption. 
A. Proposed Model Test Period 
In proposed 42 CFR 513.1(c), we 
propose that the GLOBE Model would 
have a 7-year test period consisting of 5 
performance years, beginning October 1, 
2026 and ending September 30, 2031, 
during which the GLOBE Model 
beneficiary coinsurance and adjusted 
payments to providers and suppliers 
would apply (as applicable) and 
monitoring activities would occur, and 
7 payment years during which CMS 
would calculate, invoice, collect, and 
reconcile the GLOBE Model rebates for 
a performance year, unless sooner 
terminated in accordance with proposed 
42 CFR 513.100(d)). It is necessary to

information defined in 1847A(i)(1)of the 
Act no later than 6 months after the 
close of the calendar quarter, and, as 
codified in 42 CFR 427.501(d), CMS 
would perform reconciliation of the 
rebate amount in specified scenarios, 
including one regular reconciliation of 
the rebate amount within 12 months of 
the date of the receipt of the Rebate 
Report for each applicable calendar 
quarter. As such, CMS proposes a 7-year 
test period to include 7 payment years 
in order for rebate invoicing and 
reconciliation processes to take place for 
all of the applicable calendar quarters in 
the model performance period. The 
proposed model test period is illustrated 
in Figure 1. 
In 42 CFR 513.20, we propose to 
define ‘‘performance year’’ (PY) as a 12- 
month period beginning on October 1 
and ending on September 30 during the 
first 5 years of the GLOBE Model test 
period. As such, we propose to define 
‘‘GLOBE Model performance period’’ as 
a 5-year period of time beginning on 
October 1, 2026, through September 30, 
2031. We propose to define ‘‘payment 
year’’ as a 12-month period beginning 
on October 1 and ending on September 
30 during the GLOBE Model test period. 
As such, we propose to define ‘‘GLOBE 
Model payment period’’ as the 7-year 
period of time beginning on October 1, 
2026, through September 30, 2033. 
We propose to test the GLOBE Model 
to capture all applicable billing units (as 
discussed in section II.G.4. of this 
proposed rule) for all Medicare Part B 
FFS claims for GLOBE Model drugs that 
are furnished to Medicare beneficiaries 
who are in the model cohort on the date 
of service during the model performance 
period and that are paid under the 
GLOBE Model. This means that, given 
the length of time during and after the 
end of an applicable calendar quarter 
that is necessary to conduct the 
proposed GLOBE Model processes for 
claims processing, data collection, 
rebate invoicing, manufacturer payment 
of GLOBE Model rebates, reconciliation, 
and model evaluation, model-related 
activities would continue into calendar 
year 2033, through September 30, 2033, 
as applicable, as codified in 42 CFR 
513.1(c).

B. Proposed GLOBE Model Drugs 
The proposed GLOBE Model would 
include, as GLOBE Model drugs, a set of 
Part B rebatable drugs (single source 
drugs and sole source biological 
products) that are used to treat 
beneficiaries with conditions where 
access barriers like high costs likely 
contribute to deficits in care leading to 
poor clinical outcomes and high 
program expenditures which may be 
avoidable. Analysis of historical 
Medicare Part B FFS drug spending and 
non-U.S. OECD spending for similar 
drugs and biological products has 
highlighted U.S. originator drugs 
without generic
80
or biosimilar 
biological product
81
competition (called 
‘‘single source drug’’ and ‘‘sole source 
biological’’ for purposes of this 
proposed rule and the GLOBE Model) as 
the main contributor to high drug 
spending within Medicare Part B FFS 
and globally.

Ophthalmologists are more likely to have 
prescribed or used drugs in the ophthalmic agents 
category. 
The majority of Medicare Part B FFS 
drug spending is also concentrated in a 
select number of drugs and biological 
products. For example, and as 
illustrated in Table 2, spending for the 
top 50 Medicare Part B FFS drugs and 
biological products in 2024 was 
concentrated in the therapeutic areas of 
oncology (39 percent), immunology (19 
percent), skin substitutes (13 percent), 
ophthalmology (12 percent), 
endocrinology (9 percent), and 
rheumatology (5 percent). Per 42 CFR 
427.101(b), skin substitutes are an 
excluded product category for Part B 
rebatable drugs. 
In addition, studies have shown 
notable spending growth in cancer, 
endocrinology, immunology, 
rheumatology, and ophthalmology. 
Increased drug costs limits access to 
care and treatment for beneficiaries with 
conditions in these categories increasing 
their risk for deficits of care and worse 
health outcomes. According to an ASPE 
report, between 2008 and 2021, the 
average annual payment for Medicare 
Part B drugs grew by 8.8 percent.
82
In 
contrast, Medicare Part B program 
payments in the therapeutic areas of 
oncology, immunology, endocrinology, 
and rheumatology grew by an average of 
10.8 percent annually,
83
suggesting that 
these therapeutic areas experienced 
faster spending growth. The same ASPE 
report also found that 
ophthalmologists
84
had the highest 
average annual Medicare Part B 
payment increase at 15 percent, 1.7 
times higher than the overall average 
annual payment growth for all Medicare 
Part B drugs. These therapeutic types 
and physician specialties use drugs and 
biological products to treat conditions 
related to cancer, endocrinology, 
immunology, rheumatology, and 
ophthalmology. CMS identified the 
categories for the top 50 Medicare Part 
B drugs using the standardized United 
States Pharmacopeia (USP) Drug 
Classification (DC) criteria paired with 
internal clinical knowledge and FDA 
label review. These therapeutic areas are 
associated with the following USP DC 
categories listed in Table 3. 
While higher drug costs are not the 
only contributor to Medicare Part B 
spending growth, it may lead to 
increased financial burden for some 
beneficiaries. Previous studies have 
found that high costs can increase the

Thus, CMS is 
proposing to scope the GLOBE Model to 
target potential deficits of care in 
specific USP DC categories as shown in 
Table 3 and defined in 42 CFR 513.130. 
Previous analyses have also shown 
that U.S. originator drugs are, on 
average, about 422 percent more 
expensive in the U.S. than in non-U.S. 
OECD countries. Other studies indicate 
that growth in Medicare Part B drug 
spending has largely been driven by 
single source drugs and sole source 
biologics. As such, we propose to scope 
this model to focus on testing drugs and 
biological products where program 
expenditures are most likely to arise. 
To meet this GLOBE Model intent, we 
also propose to identify the single 
source drugs and sole source biological 
products in the selected drug categories 
in Table 3 that would be GLOBE Model 
drugs for an applicable calendar quarter 
by applying a set of criteria (as further 
described in section II.B.1. of this 
proposed rule) in advance of the 
applicable calendar quarter using 
information available to CMS (as 
determined by CMS). By applying the 
proposed criteria to identify GLOBE 
Model drugs for an applicable calendar 
quarter, CMS would use a consistent 
methodology to identify a set of Part B 
rebatable drugs that are used to treat 
beneficiaries with conditions where 
deficits in care and high program 
expenditures are potentially avoidable 
and a representative subset of Part B 
rebatable drugs that account for a 
substantial portion of annual Medicare 
Part B FFS spending for Part B rebatable 
drugs. By excluding Part B rebatable 
drugs that are not sole source biological 
products, the GLOBE Model would also 
avoid including drugs with biosimilar 
biological product approvals in the U.S. 
which may be subject to unique market 
dynamics that would confound the 
model test. We note by definition that 
Part B rebatable drugs includes single 
source drugs and have chosen to re- 
iterate the term ‘‘single source drugs’’ 
for clarity and completeness. 
Using Part B rebatable drugs as the 
basis for identifying GLOBE Model 
drugs that are single source drugs and 
sole source biological products and 
meet the USP DC categories in Table 3 
is necessary to allow CMS to test an 
alternative Part B inflation rebate 
amount calculation methodology. 
Limiting inclusion in the model test to 
a set of Part B rebatable drugs that meet 
the proposed inclusion criteria is 
necessary to focus the model test where 
model impacts related to expected high 
program expenditures may be observed 
within the study population over the 
course of the model evaluation (as 
described in section II.F. of this 
proposed rule). As further described in 
section II.B.1. of this proposed rule, 
CMS would identify GLOBE Model 
drugs and add them to the GLOBE 
Model Drug List that would be made 
available on the GLOBE Model web 
page at https://www.cms.gov/priorities/
innovation/innovation-models/globe. 
The GLOBE Model Drug List would be 
maintained quarterly to add and remove 
drugs as appropriate in accordance with 
the inclusion criteria. We propose to 
identify a GLOBE Model drug using the 
same applicable billing and payment 
code (that is, Healthcare Common 
Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) 
Level II code) that is identified for the 
Part B rebatable drug pursuant to 42 
CFR 427.101(a)(1)(ii) for the Medicare 
Part B Drug Inflation Rebate Program. 
Further, for the purposes of the 
GLOBE Model test, we propose to treat 
biosimilar biological products and their 
reference biological products as ‘‘multi- 
source’’ products instead of sole source 
biological products when certain 
conditions are met due to the unique 
market dynamics of these products 
within the U.S and because qualifying 
biosimilar biological products are not 
Part B rebatable drugs. 
We note that qualifying biosimilar 
biological products (as defined under 
section 1847A(b)(8)(iii) of the Act) are 
not included in the Part B rebatable 
drug definition at 42 CFR 427.20 and 
therefore, would not be a GLOBE Model 
drug regardless of whether the criteria 
for exclusion in proposed 42 CFR 
513.130(c) were met. We also note that 
the Medicare Part B Drug Inflation 
Rebate Program includes non-qualifying 
biosimilar biological products and their 
reference biological products. 
We believe there are observable 
differences in pricing dynamics of sole 
source and multi-source biological 
products that lead to unique market 
dynamics. For example, when there is 
no competing biological product 
licensed under section 351(k) of the 
Public Health Service (PHS) Act to a 
U.S. originator drug, manufacturers are 
less likely to provide price concessions 
and rebates. Compared with sole source 
biological products, when reference 
biological products and their biosimilar 
biological products that are licensed

under section 351(k) of the PHS Act are 
sold, manufacturers of multi-source 
biological products may provide higher 
price concessions and discounts to be 
competitive. These market differences 
result in varying manufacturer-to- 
provider incentives. In markets with 
competing biosimilar biological 
products, manufacturers may provide 
discounts to providers through price 
concessions and rebates that impact 
Medicare spending. Manufacturers may 
change these discount strategies 
depending on how many patients are 
within a GLOBE Model due to 
geographic location. As such, 
manufacturers may provide lower 
discounts to clinics with more patients 
in the GLOBE Model geographic region 
than to clinics with less patients. This 
difference in incentives may lead to 
providers switching between biosimilar 
biological products to their reference 
biological products, reference biological 
products to their biosimilar biological 
products, or from one biosimilar 
biological product to another. 
We recognize that if the reference 
biological product for a biosimilar 
biological product that is licensed under 
351(k) of the PHS Act were included in 
the GLOBE Model and the biosimilar 
biological product was not included, 
beneficiaries could face higher cost 
sharing amounts for biosimilar 
biological products than reference 
biological products. The discussion in 
section II.B.1. of this proposed rule 
further describes our proposed approach 
to exclude biosimilar biological 
products and their reference biological 
products. 
1. Proposed GLOBE Model Drug 
Inclusion Criteria 
We propose to apply the following 
criteria to identify GLOBE Model drugs 
for an applicable calendar quarter 
during the GLOBE Model performance 
period. In advance of each applicable 
calendar quarter, in 42 CFR 513.130, we 
propose that CMS would identify the 
GLOBE Model drugs for that applicable 
calendar quarter by applying these 
criteria to Part B rebatable drugs (as 
identified by CMS as set forth in 42 CFR 
427.101): (1) are listed as antigout 
agents, antineoplastics, blood products 
and modifiers, central nervous system 
agents, immunological agents, metabolic 
bone disease agents, or ophthalmic 
agents as specified in the USP DC; (2) 
are single source drugs or sole source 
biological products as set forth in 
proposed 42 CFR 513.130; (3) have 
Medicare Part B FFS spending greater 
than $100 million over a 12-month 
period (as further specified in proposed 
42 CFR 513.130(d)); and (4) are drug or 
biological products that are not 
excluded from the GLOBE Model under 
proposed 42 CFR 513.130(c). A Part B 
rebatable drug would have to meet all 
the four criteria to be included as a 
GLOBE Model drug. 
To identify GLOBE Model drugs for 
the first criterion for the first applicable 
calendar quarter of the GLOBE Model 
performance period, we propose to use 
the USP Drug Classification 2025 (USP 
DC 2025)
88
to identify all Part B 
rebatable drugs that meet the categories 
listed in Table 3 using their scientific or 
nonproprietary name(s), brand name, 
and/or NDC. The publicly available USP 
DC system has four tiers, of which we 
propose to use the highest-level tier, 
USP DC category. CMS believes the drug 
category level is sufficient to identify 
therapeutic areas that may have deficits 
of care, while allowing for differences in 
mechanism of action and biological or 
molecular targets for products that treat 
the same therapeutic area. We recognize 
that a drug or biological product may be 
listed in more than one USP DC 
category. As such, as long as one of the 
categories listed in Table 3 applies to 
the drug or biological product, it would 
be considered to have met this criterion. 
We also recognize that drug and 
biological products may be added to the 
Part B rebatable drug list after the 
GLOBE Model’s start and may not 
appear in USP DC 2025. As such, we 
propose that for Part B rebatable drugs 
that were not previously assigned a USP 
DC category, CMS would use the most 
recently published USP DC to identify 
the category for such Part B rebatable 
drug to determine whether it meets the 
first criterion. We also propose that once 
CMS has identified the USP DC category 
for a GLOBE Model drug or biological 
product, it would remain in that 
category for the entire model duration. 
Accordingly, drugs or biological 
products included in the initial GLOBE 
Model Drug List would retain their USP 
DC 2025 category, while newly added 
drugs and biological products to the 
GLOBE Model Drug List would retain 
the category assigned at the time of their 
identification, based on the most 
recently published USP DC available 
then. We also propose that, when posted 
on the GLOBE Model website, the 
GLOBE Model Drug List would include 
the USP DC category for each HCPCS 
Level II code. Table 4 shows the 
associated USP DC category for an 
illustrative list of HCPCS Level II codes. 
The USP DC 2025 has 50 categories of 
which Medicare Part B rebatable drugs 
during 2024 are listed in at least 34 of 
them. Our proposal to include 7 
categories represents 21 percent of the 
34 possible Medicare Part B rebatable 
drug categories. Analysis of 2024 
Medicare Part B FFS spending data 
indicates that these 7 USP DC categories 
were responsible for most Medicare Part 
B spending (91 percent), with 
antineoplastics having the highest 
proportion of any single category at 
approximately 47 percent. 
We are also proposing that if USP 
creates a new drug category that stems 
from the drug categories set forth in 42 
CFR 513.130(b)(1), then such newly 
created drug categories would be 
incorporated into the GLOBE Model 
drug inclusion criterion. We propose 
that CMS would make this 
determination based on a review of USP 
revision bulletins, revision histories, 
and corresponding change log 
information published by USP. 
For the second criterion, CMS would 
focus the GLOBE Model test on a subset 
of Part B rebatable drugs that are single 
source drugs or sole source biological 
products. We recognize by definition, 
only single source drugs are Part B 
rebatable drugs and are proposing to use 
the same definition of single source 
drug as defined in section 
1847A(c)(6)(D) of the Act, which is not 
a multiple source drug and which is 
produced or distributed under a new 
drug application approved by the FDA, 
including a drug product marketed by 
any cross-licensed producers or 
distributors operating under the new 
drug application. A multiple source 
drug, as defined in section 1847A(c)(6)(C) of the Act, means, for a 
calendar quarter, a drug for which there 
are 2 or more drug products which: (1) 
are rated as therapeutically equivalent 
(under the FDA’s most recent 
publication of ‘‘Approved Drug 
Products with Therapeutic Equivalence 
Evaluations’’); (2) except as provided in 
section 1847(A)(6)(E) of the Act, are 
pharmaceutically equivalent and 
bioequivalent, as determined under 
section 1847(A)(6)(F) of the Act and as 
determined by the FDA, and (3) are sold 
or marketed in the United States during 
the quarter. 
We also propose to define ‘‘sole 
source biological’’ in 42 CFR 513.20 for 
the purposes of the GLOBE Model as a 
biological product licensed by the FDA 
in under a biologics license application 
(BLA) under section 351(a) of the PHS 
Act and that, at time of evaluating for 
inclusion into the GLOBE Model for 
each applicable ASP calendar quarter, is 
not the reference biological product, as 
defined in section 1847A(c)(6)(I) of the 
Act, for a biosimilar biological product

Reference product is defined in section 
1847A(c)(6)(l) of the Act as ‘‘biological product 
licensed under section 351 of the PHS Act that is 
referred to in application described in subparagraph 
(H) of the biosimilar biological product.’’ See 
https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/ 1847A.htm. 
licensed by the FDA in a BLA under 
section 351(k) of the PHS Act. The 
biosimilar biological product must be 
recognized in the FDA’s Purple Book 
and be identified as sold or marketed in 
FDA’s NDC Directory. We note that the 
proposed definition for sole source 
biological is different than the definition 
for single source biological, as defined in section 1847A(c)(6)(D) of the Act. As 
the proposed definition of a sole source 
biological is based on a 351(a) licensure 
and not being the reference biological 
product for a biosimilar biological 
product sold or marketed, any biological 
product that meets this definition—even 
if marketed by any cross-licensed 
producers or distributors operating 
under the BLA—qualifies as such sole 
source biological product. The 
counterpart to a sole source biological 
product is a multi-source biological 
product, and the difference is that they 
have a reference biological product and 
a biosimilar biological product that is 
recognized in the FDA’s Purple Book 
and identified as sold or marketed. 
We also propose to use the definition 
for ‘‘sold or marketed’’ established in 42 
CFR 427.20 which would mean the 
marketing data as listed in either the 
ASP data reported to CMS by a 
manufacturer or an NDC directory list a 
start marketing date for the biosimilar 
biological product prior to the 
applicable calendar quarter and when 
one of the following criteria is met: (1) 
the NDC has units reported for the 
rebate quarter; (2) the end marketing 
date is during the rebate quarter; (3) the 
end marketing date is after the rebate 
quarter; or (4) the end marketing date is 
missing. 
To apply this criterion, we propose, at 
the time of evaluating inclusion in the 
GLOBE Model for each applicable ASP 
calendar quarter, CMS would use the 
FDA’s NDC Directory, including 
historical information from NDC 
Directory files such as discontinued, 
delisted, and expired listings, provided 
by the FDA or published on the FDA 
website to determine the marketing 
status of a biosimilar biological product. 
We propose that, if a biosimilar 
biological product is marketed, as 
determined by CMS for purposes of the 
GLOBE Model as of the beginning of an 
applicable calendar quarter, the 
biosimilar biological product, and 
reference biological product
89
for such 
biosimilar biological product would not 
be included as a GLOBE Model drug for 
the applicable calendar quarter. We 
propose that for an applicable calendar 
quarter CMS would conduct this 
analysis as of the beginning of the 
applicable calendar quarter to update 
the GLOBE Model Drug List. 
We recognize for the GLOBE Model 
that authorized generics and unbranded 
biological products share the same new 
drug application approved by the FDA 
or 351(a) licensure as the original drug 
and biological product and therefore 
meet the proposed definition of single 
source drug and sole source biologicals. 
As such, authorized generics and 
unbranded biological products could 
potentially be GLOBE Model drugs. 
Authorized generics are drugs sold 
without their brand name by the 
original manufacturer or a third party 
under the NDA of the original drug. 
Unbranded biological products are 
biological products sold without their 
brand name by the original 
manufacturer or a third party licensed 
by the BLA 351(a) of the original 
biological product. Since both 
authorized generics and unbranded 
biological products, are directly or 
indirectly, sponsored by the original 
pharmaceutical drug manufacturer, we 
believe that if an authorized generic or 
unbranded biological product is 
included in the Medicare Part B Drug 
Inflation Rebate Program, then, subject 
to the exclusions described in the next 
section of this proposed rule, it would 
be included in the GLOBE Model. In 
other words, an authorized generic or 
unbranded biological product could 
meet the definition of a single source 
drug or sole source biological product if 
approved under section 505(c) of the 
FD&C Act or licensed under section 
351(a) of the PHS Act. 
For the third criterion, we propose to 
identify the Part B rebatable drugs with 
total Medicare Part B FFS allowed 
charges greater than $100 million over 
a 12-month period using separately 
payable final action claims (spend 
threshold). As specified in 42 CFR 
513.130(d), we propose that CMS would 
identify Medicare Part B FFS final 
action claims with dates of service 
within the consecutive 12-month period 
ending 6 months prior to the start of the 
applicable calendar quarter that have 
separately payable allowed charges 
greater than $0 for any billing and 
payment code used to describe the 
GLOBE Model drug, and sum the 
allowed charges. For example, if the 
applicable calendar quarter is Q1 2027, 
all separately payable final action 
claims with Medicare Part B FFS 
allowed charges greater than $0 for any 
billing and payment code used to 
describe the Part B rebatable drug with 
a date of service from July 1, 2025 to 
June 30, 2026 would be summed 
together to determine if the spend 
threshold is met. By applying a 
minimum total annual Medicare Part B 
FFS spend as an inclusion criteria, CMS 
intends that the GLOBE Model would be 
focused on Part B rebatable drugs that 
account for a significant portion of 
annual Medicare Part B FFS drug 
spending and on drugs that would be 
expected to account for approximately a 
minimum of $8 million in allowed 
charges per month under the model. We 
also propose Part B rebatable drugs 
would need to meet the spend threshold 
at least one time during the duration of 
the GLOBE Model to meet this criterion 
for the applicable ASP calendar quarter 
and subsequent applicable ASP 
calendar quarters. For example, if Drug 
I meets the $100 million threshold for 
performance year 1 over a 12-month 
period for Q3 2026 but not for Q4 2026, 
Drug I is still considered to have met 
this criterion for Q4 2026 and the 
subsequent GLOBE Model ASP calendar 
quarters and would retain inclusion in 
the GLOBE Model. 
Historical analysis of Medicare Part B 
FFS drug spending has shown that the 
majority of spending is focused on a 
select number of drugs. A threshold of 
$100 million in total annual Medicare 
Part B FFS spending applied to Part B 
rebatable drugs for the consecutive 12- 
month period ending on December 31, 
2024 would encompass 90 percent of 
the total 2024 Medicare Part B FFS 
spending on Part B rebatable drugs and 
account for 21 percent of Part B 
rebatable drugs (by HCPCS Level II 
code). This analysis highlights that a 
small number of Part B rebatable drugs 
represent the majority of Medicare Part 
B FFS drug spending. A threshold of 
$100 million would therefore focus the 
GLOBE Model on a majority of Medicare 
Part B drug spending to enable detection 
of expected savings for the GLOBE 
Model test while reducing the burden of 
studying the impacts of the GLOBE 
Model on all Part B rebatable drugs. 
2. Proposed Exclusion of Certain Part B 
Rebatable Drugs 
To avoid interactions with other 
initiatives and programs that focus on 
manufacturers of drugs payable under 
Medicare Part B, in 42 CFR 
513.130(c)(1)(ii), we propose to exclude 
from the GLOBE Model a Part B 
rebatable drug from the GLOBE Model 
for which a maximum fair price (MFP) 
(as defined in section 1191(c)(3) of the 
Act) under the Medicare Drug Price 
Negotiation Program is in effect. This 
proposal would mean that drugs that

CMS. Medicare Drug Price Negotiation 
Program: Final Guidance, Implementation of 
sections 1191 through 1198 of the Act for Initial 
Price Applicability Year 2028 and Manufacturer 
Effectuation of the Maximum Fair Price in 2026, 
2027, and 2028. September 30, 2025. Available at: 
https://edit.cms.gov/files/document/ipay-2028-

91
In accordance with the IRA, CMS engages in 
good-faith negotiations with participating 
companies and uses statutory factors listed at 
section 1194(e) of the Act as the basis for 
negotiation an MFP. A Primary Manufacturer with 
a selected drug is required to ensure that the 
negotiated price, the MFP, is made available to 
MFP-eligible individuals and to pharmacies, mail 
order services, and other dispensing entities with 
respect to such MFP-eligible individuals who are 
dispensed such drug, and to hospitals, physicians, 
and other providers of services and suppliers with 
respect to such MFP-eligible individuals to whom 
they furnish or administer such drug. The MFP 
applies to a selected drug during its price 
applicability period. 
92
This statistic is based on an evaluation of all 
2024 Medicare Part B FFS claims that would meet 
the GLOBE Model inclusion and exclusion criteria 
and does not account for any geography 
distinctions. Refer to section II.F. of this proposed 
rule for discussion on proposed GLOBE Model 
geographies. 
have been selected for Medicare Drug 
Price Negotiation (under section 1192 of 
the Act), for which a MFP has been 
agreed upon, and for which the 
manufacturer of such drug is required to 
provide access to the MFP, would be 
excluded from the GLOBE Model for 
appliable calendar quarters in which the 
MFP is in effect.
90 91
For example, if a 
GLOBE Model drug is selected for 
negotiation in 2027 for initial price 
applicability year 2029, the 
manufacturer and CMS agree upon a 
MFP for the drug during 2027, and the 
MFP would go into effect on January 1, 
2029, the GLOBE Model drug would 
exit the GLOBE Model on December 31, 
2028. We note that the earliest date for 
which a MFP would apply for a drug 
payable under Medicare Part B is 
January 1, 2028, per section 1192(a)(3) 
of the Act. Because we are proposing to 
begin the GLOBE Model on October 1, 
2026, we note that there would be no 
Part B rebatable drugs that could be a 
GLOBE Model drug for which the 
manufacturer is required to provide 
access to the MFP at model start. We 
propose that this exclusion from the 
GLOBE Model would end when the 
Medicare Part B payment limit for a Part 
B rebatable drug that would otherwise 
be eligible to be a GLOBE Model drug 
is no longer based on the MFP. We 
believe that excluding drugs when the 
Medicare Part B payment limit is based 
on a MFP is appropriate because these 
drugs are subject to different market 
dynamics within the U.S., and we 
believe that including them could 
confound the model test and impact our 
ability to evaluate the impacts of the 
model. 
In addition, we propose, in 42 CFR 
513.130(c)(1)(i), that a Part B rebatable 
drug would not be a GLOBE Model drug 
for applicable calendar quarters prior to 
the first applicable calendar quarter for 
which CMS identifies a specified 
amount pursuant to 42 CFR 427.302(b) 
for such drug. This proposal would 
ensure that the GLOBE Model and the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program would treat a subsequently 
approved drug (that is, a drug first 
approved or licensed by the FDA after 
December 1, 2020) in a similar manner. 
In other words, until a specified amount 
is established by CMS for a 
subsequently approved Part B rebatable 
drug, that drug would not be considered 
for the GLOBE Model. We note that, 
given the proposed GLOBE Model drug 
inclusion criteria in 42 CFR 513.130(b), 
this exclusion would only be applied to 
drugs that meet all the proposed 
inclusion criteria (that is, single source 
drugs or sole source biological products 
that are Part B rebatable drugs that are 
in the USP DC categories shown in 
Table 3 with total annual Medicare Part 
B FFS allowed charges greater than the 
$100 million during the consecutive 12- 
month period that ends 6 months before 
the applicable calendar quarter). 
We note that during the duration of 
the GLOBE Model, certain drugs or 
biological products may no longer be 
Part B rebatable drugs. As such, in 42 
CFR 513.130(c)(1)(iii) we propose that if 
a GLOBE Model drug is no longer a Part 
B rebatable drug for an applicable 
calendar quarter, it would be excluded 
from the GLOBE Model for that 
applicable calendar quarter and any 
other subsequent quarters in which it is 
no longer rebatable. 
3. Summary of GLOBE Model Drug 
Inclusion and Exclusion 
To summarize, GLOBE Model drugs 
as defined in 42 CFR 513.130 would be 
a subset of Part B rebatable drugs that: 
(1) have the listed USP DC categories in 
Table 3; (2) are single source drugs or 
sole source biological products; (3) have 
a HCPCS Level II code with Medicare 
Part B FFS spending greater than $100 
million over a 12-month period; and (4) 
are not excluded from the GLOBE 
Model as proposed in 42 CFR 
513.130(c). 
In addition, once a drug or biological 
product has been identified as meeting 
the criterion for inclusion in the GLOBE 
Model, they would remain in the 
GLOBE Model unless the drug or 
biological product becomes multi- 
source (no longer a single source drug 
or sole source biological product) or 
meets the exclusions proposed in 42 
CFR 513.130(c). 
The drugs or biological products that 
meet the proposed definition of GLOBE 
Model drugs are frequently prescribed 
and administered by various providers 
in settings such as a physician’s office 
or hospital outpatient department to 
Medicare beneficiaries with various 
medical conditions and would have had 
a minimum of $100 million in Medicare 
Part B FFS allowed charges over a 12- 
month period. Examples include drugs 
used to treat cancer and related 
conditions, rheumatoid arthritis and 
other immune mediated conditions, and 
macular degeneration and other serious 
eye conditions. Medicare Part B FFS 
beneficiaries who receive such drugs, 
often on a recurring basis, face 
substantial cost-sharing liability directly 
related to each drug administration in 
the form of monthly Medicare Part B 
premiums, the Medicare Part B annual 
deductible and coinsurance, and 
premiums and coinsurance through 
their supplemental insurance. The 
proposed approach for identifying 
GLOBE Model drugs could encompass 
approximately 55 percent
92
of annual 
Medicare Part B FFS drug spending for 
separately payable Medicare Part B 
drugs based on an analysis of all 2024 
Medicare Part B FFS claims. This 
proposed approach also focuses the 
model test on single source drugs and 
sole source biological products with 
high Medicare Part B program 
expenditures that could have 
beneficiaries with deficits of care due to 
high costs. 
Table 4, Illustrative GLOBE Model 
Drug HCPCS Level II Code List, in 
section II.B.6. of this proposed rule 
shows an illustrative list of how the 
GLOBE Model could apply to Part B 
drugs by HCPCS Level II code using 
available claims information from 
calendar year (CY) 2024 after applying 
the proposed drug inclusion and 
exclusions as discussed in this section 
of this proposed rule. This illustrative 
list may not fully capture all relevant 
HCPCS Level II codes for potential 
GLOBE Model drugs and may include 
HCPCS Level II codes for drugs that may 
not meet the inclusion criteria and 
exclusion criteria that would be 
specified in a final rule establishing the 
GLOBE Model. 
4. Alternatives Considered 
We considered including all Part B 
rebatable drugs in the GLOBE Model. 
However, Medicare Part B FFS drug 
spending is concentrated among high 
expenditure drugs, with 50 drugs (by 
HCPCS Level II code) accounting for 64 
percent of 2024 Medicare Part B FFS 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:53 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\23DEP2.SGM 23DEP2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260258 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules 93
The minimum number of beneficiaries for a 
drug selected for the Medicare Drug Price 
Negotiation Program for the Initial Price 
Applicability Year 2026 is 20,000 (Imbruvica). 
Based on internal CMS analysis, if this was used as 
a threshold, then approximately 17 percent of all 
HCPCS Level II codes billed under Medicare Part 
B in 2024 would have met this criterion. 
drug spending. We also noted that many 
Medicare Part B rebatable drugs have 
average monthly total Medicare Part B 
FFS allowed charges of less than $10 
million. For example, using separately 
payable claims, 302 Medicare Part B 
rebatable drugs had less than $100 
million in total 2024 Medicare Part B 
FFS drug spending each, representing 7 
percent of total 2024 Medicare Part B 
FFS drug spending. Similarly, 266 
Medicare Part B rebatable drugs had less 
than $50 million in total 2024 Medicare 
Part B FFS drug spending each, 
accounting for 3 percent of total 2024 
Medicare Part B FFS drug spending. 
These lower spend drugs could have 
approximately $8 million or less in 
allowed charges per month paid under 
the GLOBE Model, based on our 
proposed model design described in 
section II.B of this proposed rule. 
However, the approximately 80 Part B 
rebatable drugs with greater than $100 
million in 2024 Medicare Part B FFS 
allowed charges accounted for 61 
percent of 2024 Medicare Part B FFS 
drug spending. As such, it may be too 
burdensome for the operational and 
administrative efforts to include Part B 
rebatable drugs with less than $100 
million in total Medicare Part B FFS 
allowed charges during a consecutive 
12-month period in the model test at 
this time in order to detect potential 
changes in Medicare spending or 
beneficiaries’ quality of care. We believe 
that the model test and evaluation could 
be efficiently focused on Medicare Part 
B rebatable drugs with over $100 
million in total annual Medicare Part B 
FFS spending without sacrificing the 
potential for meaningful model findings 
and learning. Therefore, we are not 
proposing to include all Part B rebatable 
drugs in the GLOBE Model and instead 
are proposing to focus the model on a 
subset of drugs that would be 
anticipated to have a meaningful 
amount of Medicare spending under the 
model test and address deficits of care 
for beneficiaries. 
In addition, we considered the 
alternative of including all Part B 
rebatable drugs in the GLOBE Model, 
which would introduce multi-source 
biological products (biosimilar 
biological products and their reference 
biological products) into the model. 
Most of the biosimilar biological 
products that are available now and are 
separately payable under Medicare Part 
B are qualifying biosimilar biological 
products, which are excluded from the 
definition of Part B rebatable drugs, and 
as such could be excluded from being a 
Part B rebatable drug for some portion 
of the model performance period. We 
recognize the list of qualifying 
biosimilar biological products may also 
change quarterly when the ASP of the 
biosimilar biological product exceeds 
the ASP of the reference biological 
product or when the applicable 5-year 
period for a temporary payment add-on 
has elapsed. Therefore, if biosimilar 
biological products that are not 
qualifying biosimilar biological 
products for an applicable calendar 
quarter were included as GLOBE Model 
drugs, there could be operational 
challenges related to monitoring, 
potential for beneficiary and healthcare 
provider confusion related to 
beneficiary coinsurance changes during 
the GLOBE Model performance years, 
and increased complexity and potential 
challenges in operating the model 
evaluation. As such and to meet our 
model intent, we propose to exclude 
biosimilar biological products licensed 
under 351(k) of the PHS Act and their 
reference biological products as 
proposed in 42 CFR 513.130(b). 
We considered an alternate exclusion 
process for reference biological products 
by requiring the manufacturers of the 
reference biological product to submit 
an attestation of when a competing 
biosimilar biological product would be 
sold in the U.S. However, assessing 
whether market competition exists after 
a biosimilar biological product has been 
licensed by the FDA under section 
351(k) of the PHS Act would likely 
require substantial investigation to 
verify a specific date of first sale. There 
would be insufficient time for CMS to 
review requests by a manufacturer of a 
reference biological product for GLOBE 
Model exclusion before the 
manufacturer submits ASP information 
for the applicable calendar quarter and 
prior to determination of the GLOBE 
Model beneficiary coinsurance for 
included drugs. Further, manufacturers 
of reference biological products may not 
have an accurate estimation of when 
sales of a biosimilar biological product 
would be first sold in the U.S. 
Therefore, our proposed approach to use 
the sold or marketed definition 
established in 42 CFR 427.20 and FDA’s 
NDC Directory to identify biosimilar 
biological products that are marketed 
would likely be a faster and more 
efficient way than verifying reference 
biological product manufacturer 
attestations to identify when a 
biosimilar biological product and its 
reference biological product would be 
excluded from the GLOBE Model drug 
list of an applicable calendar quarter to 
support our goal of focusing the model 
test on single source drugs and sole 
source biological products. 
We also considered including 
additional USP DC categories such as 
antimyasthenic agents, cardiovascular 
agents, dermatological agents; genetic, 
enzyme, or protein disorder: 
replacement, modifiers, treatment; and 
respiratory tract/pulmonary agents, 
which are also categories represented in 
Part B rebatable drugs with Medicare 
Part B FFS spending over $100 million 
in 2024. However, we believe starting 
the model with the high expenditure 
therapeutic areas and their USP DC 
categories shown in Table 3 would help 
focus the model test on patients with 
related conditions that are likely 
exposed to higher financial burden and 
greater deficits of care. We may explore 
a future expansion to other high spend 
USP DC categories outside of the 
therapeutic areas listed in Table 3 after 
we have made operational and 
administrative progress with respect to 
the model. We also considered 
reviewing the latest published USP DC 
at the beginning of each applicable 
calendar quarter to determine if a drug 
or biological product has changed 
categories. However, we believe using 
the 2025 USP DC for the GLOBE Model 
drug list, except in the case of drugs and 
biological products added after model 
start, would maintain data 
standardization. Similarly, we also 
believe keeping the same category for 
each drug and biological product once 
identified also maintains data 
standardization and allows CMS to test 
and evaluate an alternative Part B 
inflation rebate amount calculation. In 
addition, we considered categorizing the 
drugs or biological products by 
therapeutic areas such as endocrinology, 
immunology, rheumatology, oncology, 
or ophthalmology or for CMS to develop 
a classification method. However, we 
believe using a publicly available drug 
classification list such as the USP DC 
provides for a more transparent and 
straightforward method for identifying 
GLOBE Model drugs. 
We considered other alternatives to 
the proposed subset of Part B rebatable 
drugs included as GLOBE Model Drugs 
such as including only a certain number 
of Part B rebatable drugs; only including 
drugs with high utilization among the 
Medicare population, for example, 
drugs furnished to more than 20,000 
Medicare Part B FFS beneficiaries 
during a specified period;

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260259 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules including drugs based on high annual 
per beneficiary coinsurance liability, for 
example, drugs with an average per 
beneficiary coinsurance amount greater 
than $200 during a consecutive 12- 
month period (assuming a coinsurance 
percentage of 20 percent, this alternative 
would focus on drugs with 
approximately $1,000 or more in 
average per beneficiary Medicare Part B 
allowed charges during a consecutive 
12-month period). We also considered 
phasing in the inclusion of Part B 
rebatable drugs in the GLOBE Model 
over time, for example, starting the 
model with 50 drugs and adding drugs 
at the beginning of each performance 
year until all Part B rebatable drugs that 
would not be specifically excluded 
would be included in the model. 
We are also considering if the spend 
threshold (total Medicare Part B FFS 
allowed charges greater than $100 
million over a 12-month period) would 
be adjusted for each subsequent 
performance year by the percentage 
increase or decrease in the CPI–U for the 
previous performance year. This would 
mean that for each subsequent 
performance year, the GLOBE Model 
spend threshold would adjust to 
account for inflation. We welcome 
comments on whether CMS should 
update the spend threshold based on 
inflation. 
We considered these alternative 
approaches and believe that focusing 
the model on higher spend drugs that 
impact beneficiaries who likely have a 
deficit of care allows a transparent, 
consistent, and clear approach that 
would provide sufficient opportunity to 
observe the impacts of the model test on 
a sufficient number of Medicare FFS 
beneficiaries who may receive a Part B 
rebatable drug. Our proposed approach 
would minimize complexity within the 
model implementation and evaluation 
and improve CMS’ ability to understand 
the findings from model monitoring and 
evaluation activities by focusing on a 
subset of beneficiaries. We believe the 
benefits of including the higher spend 
drugs for specific USP DC categories of 
Part B rebatable drugs in the GLOBE 
Model with limited exclusions as 
discussed in this section of this 
proposed rule enable the model to 
encompass a large number of Part B 
rebatable drugs without increasing 
complexity and burden that may occur 
with a larger set of Part B rebatable 
drugs. 
We welcome comments on our 
process for identifying the USP DC 
categories, our method for identifying 
and excluding certain drugs, and the 
alternatives we considered. We also 
welcome comments on CMS’ proposed 
process for when a reference biological 
product would be excluded from the list 
of GLOBE Model drugs for an applicable 
calendar quarter. Specifically, we seek 
feedback on ways CMS could structure 
the exclusion process to minimize the 
potential for excluding a reference 
biological product for a biosimilar 
biological product that is marketed 
under a license under 351(k) of the PHS 
Act but not sold during an applicable 
calendar quarter. 
5. Considerations Related to Cell and 
Gene Therapies and Plasma-Derived 
Products 
We are also considering excluding 
cell and gene therapies (CGTs) from the 
GLOBE Model. CGTs include cellular 
immunotherapies, cancer vaccines and 
other products aimed to treat or prevent 
certain diseases including cancer, 
genetic diseases, and infectious 
diseases. We seek comments on the 
merits of excluding CGTs based on 
supply chain criteria, or if there are 
other factors that warrant their inclusion 
or exclusion. We similarly welcome 
comments on whether the GLOBE 
Model would exclude plasma-derived 
products, particularly because these 
products may be more likely to 
experience shortages and the rebate 
amount for these products may be 
reduced as discussed in section II.G. of 
this proposed rule. 
6. Illustrative List of Proposed 
Performance Year 1 GLOBE Model 
Drugs and Model Participants 
To create an illustrative GLOBE 
Model Drug HCPCS Level II Code List, 
we identified the 2024 Part B rebatable 
drugs by HCPCS Level II code, applied 
the proposed GLOBE Model drug 
inclusion criteria and exclusions as 
discussed in sections II.B.1. and II.B.2. 
of this proposed rule. Using this 
approach, an illustrative GLOBE Model 
Drug HCPCS Level II Code List is shown 
in Table 4 and includes drugs and 
biological products that met the 
proposed criteria for at least one 
applicable calendar quarter in 2024. 
Table 4 is an illustrative list of how the 
GLOBE Model might apply to Part B 
rebatable drugs and is not intended as 
a list of GLOBE Model drugs or Part B 
rebatable drugs that would be applicable 
for a quarter in a performance year. 
Further, this illustrative list is based on 
CMS’ initial analyses and proposals 
discussed in this proposed rule and is 
provided for informational purposes 
only. Readers should note that the 
illustrative list may not reflect the final 
model design and does not indicate that 
these drugs or biological products 
would owe a GLOBE Model rebate.

C. Proposed Defined Population 
For the GLOBE Model design, we 
considered ways to identify the 
Medicare beneficiaries who would be 
eligible for inclusion in either the 
intervention or comparison groups. 
After considering a number of factors, 
we propose to use a geographically 
randomized design such that the 
defined population for the GLOBE 
Model would be a set of CMS-selected 
Medicare Part B FFS beneficiaries who 
are identified as eligible for inclusion in 
the model cohort as set forth in 42 CFR 
513.120 and receive a GLOBE Model 
drug (as set forth in 42 CFR 513.130) 
during the model performance period 
for which separate Medicare Part B 
payment is made under the GLOBE 
Model. The Medicare Part B FFS 
beneficiaries who are identified as 
eligible for inclusion in the model 
cohort would be included in the model 
cohort as a GLOBE Model beneficiary as 
of the date they are furnished a GLOBE 
Model drug for which separate Medicare 
Part B payment is made during the 
model performance period. GLOBE 
Model beneficiaries would be eligible 
for the GLOBE Model adjusted 
beneficiary coinsurance for GLOBE 
Model drugs, if applicable, and would 
remain in the model cohort unless they 
no longer meet the criteria for inclusion. 
A GLOBE Model beneficiary may 
receive one or more GLOBE Model 
drugs. 
Specifically, we propose that, prior to 
the model start, CMS would randomly 
identify the model geographic areas 
(based on ZIP Code Tabulation Areas as 
discussed in section II.F.2. of this 
proposed rule). We also propose that, 
prior to model start and periodically 
thereafter, but no more frequently than 
weekly, CMS would identify eligible 
Medicare FFS beneficiaries (as set forth 
in 42 CFR 513.120) and update the 
GLOBE Model Eligible Beneficiary List, 
which would be effective when the 
Medicare claims processing system are 
updated with the GLOBE Model Eligible 
Beneficiary List information. We 
propose that the identification of 
eligible beneficiaries and the timing of 
such identification and updating of the 
GLOBE Model Eligible Beneficiary List 
and the Medicare claims processing 
systems, as well as the identification of 
Medicare FFS beneficiaries who are 
eligible for inclusion in the comparison 
group, would be performed by CMS and 
would not be subject to review. In 42 
CFR 513.120, we propose how CMS 
would identify the Medicare 
beneficiaries who would be eligible for 
inclusion in the model cohort and 
comparison group. In 42 CFR 513.20, we 
propose to define the term ‘‘GLOBE 
Model eligible beneficiary’’ as a 
Medicare beneficiary who has been 
identified by CMS for potential 
inclusion in the model and added to the 
GLOBE Model Eligible Beneficiary List 
for some or a portion of the GLOBE 
Model performance period as set forth 
in 42 CFR 513.120. Specifically, in 42 
CFR 513.120(b), we propose that, 
approximately 30 days prior to model 
start using available Medicare program 
administrative information as 
determined by CMS, CMS would 
identify Medicare beneficiaries who are 
enrolled in Medicare Part B, have 
Traditional Medicare Part B as their 
primary payer, and have an address of 
record within the GLOBE Model 
geographic areas selected for inclusion 
in the model at model start (as 
identified by CMS under 42 CFR 
513.110(c)), as determined by CMS. 
These beneficiaries would encompass 
the Medicare FFS beneficiaries who 
would be eligible for inclusion in the 
GLOBE Model at model start. CMS 
would add such beneficiaries to the 
GLOBE Model Eligible Beneficiary List 
and update the Medicare claims 
processing systems with such list for the 
first applicable calendar quarter of 
performance year one. 
Similarly, in 42 CFR 513.120(b)(2), we 
propose that, approximately 30 days 
prior to model start using available 
Medicare program administrative 
information as determined by CMS, we 
would identify Medicare beneficiaries 
who are enrolled in Medicare Part B, 
have Traditional Medicare Part B as 
their primary payer, and do not have an 
address of record within the GLOBE 
Model geographic areas selected for 
inclusion in the model at model start (as 
identified by CMS under 42 CFR 
513.110(c)), as determined by CMS. 
These beneficiaries would be assigned 
as being eligible for inclusion in the 
comparison group. For a discussion on 
the evaluation, see section II.P. of this 
proposed rule. 
To maintain a clear record of which 
beneficiaries are eligible for inclusion in 
the model cohort, in 42 CFR 513.120(c), 
we propose that, CMS would update the 
GLOBE Model Eligible Beneficiary List 
periodically, but not more frequently 
than weekly, using available Medicare 
program administrative information as 
determined by CMS, to: (1) identify the 
Medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled 
in Medicare Part B, have Traditional 
Medicare Part B as their primary payer, 
and have an address of record within 
the GLOBE Model geographic areas 
selected for inclusion (as identified by 
CMS under 42 CFR 513.110(c)), are not 
yet included on the GLOBE Model 
Eligible Beneficiary List, are not 
assigned as eligible for the comparison 
group, and adds such beneficiaries to 
the GLOBE Model Eligible Beneficiary List at the next update; and (2) identify beneficiaries on the GLOBE Model 
Eligible Beneficiary List that no longer 
meet the criteria for a GLOBE Model 
eligible beneficiary and removes such 
beneficiaries from the GLOBE Model 
Eligible Beneficiary List at the next 
update. CMS would not routinely 
reevaluate the eligibility of beneficiaries 
who were identified as eligible for the 
comparison group. That is, beneficiaries

HCPCS Level II Code Short Descri tion USP DC Cate o *Note: The scientific or nonproprietary name was used to identify the 2025 USP DC category. A HCPCS Level II code may belong in more than one USP DC Category. 60262 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules who are identified as eligible for 
inclusion in the comparison group prior 
to model start would remain eligible for 
inclusion in the comparison group and 
model monitoring and analyses as 
determined by CMS. 
In 42 CFR 513.120(d), we propose 
beneficiary exclusions for clarity 
regarding the beneficiaries who would 
not be eligible for assignment to the 
GLOBE Model Eligible Beneficiary List 
or comparison group, as applicable: 
beneficiaries who do not have Medicare 
Part B FFS as their primary payer, and 
beneficiaries who are enrolled in a 
Medicare Advantage plan, section 1876 
of the Act cost plan, section 1833 of the 
Act healthcare prepayment plans, or 
who have other group health coverage 
that is a primary payer (such as 
employer-sponsored health insurance). 
In addition, 42 CFR 513.120(d)(3) 
clarifies that beneficiaries who are 
identified by CMS as eligible for 
inclusion in the comparison group prior 
to model start remain eligible for the 
comparison group as determined by 
CMS. 
We propose that, for purposes of 
identifying a beneficiary’s address and 
determining if the beneficiary’s address 
is within the GLOBE Model geographic 
areas, we would use the beneficiary’s 
address as recorded in CMS’ Medicare 
Beneficiary Database (MBD), System No. 
09–70–0536, at the time CMS identifies 
beneficiaries for inclusion in the model. 
We also propose to define in 42 CFR 
513.20 the term ‘‘GLOBE Model 
geographic areas’’ as the set of ZIP 
Codes in the U.S., excluding U.S. 
territories identified as set forth in 42 
CFR 513.110 (as discussed in section 
II.F. of this proposed rule). 
Under our proposed approach for 
identifying the defined population, 
beneficiaries who are identified by CMS 
as a GLOBE Model eligible beneficiary, 
at the start of the model or 
subsequently, would be added to the 
GLOBE Model Eligible Beneficiary List 
and remain on the list until the model 
ends or the beneficiary is no longer 
enrolled in Medicare FFS or is 
otherwise ineligible for inclusion. For 
example, if a beneficiary is identified for 
inclusion on the GLOBE Model Eligible 
Beneficiary List based on the 
beneficiary’s address as recorded in 
CMS’ Medicare Beneficiary Database 
(MBD) being within the selected model 
geographic areas and then subsequently 
the beneficiary’s address recorded in 
CMS’ MBD changes such that the 
beneficiary no longer has an address 
within the GLOBE model geographic 
areas, the beneficiary would continue to 
be assigned as a GLOBE Model eligible 
beneficiary unless the beneficiary is no 
longer enrolled in Medicare FFS or is 
otherwise ineligible for inclusion. 
Beneficiaries who become newly 
enrolled in Medicare FFS due to 
becoming newly eligible for Medicare 
FFS after the model begins and are 
identified by CMS as a GLOBE Model 
eligible beneficiary (because all criteria 
are met) would be added to the GLOBE 
Model Eligible Beneficiary List from the 
time CMS next updates the list and 
remain on the list unless the beneficiary 
is no longer enrolled in Medicare FFS 
or is ineligible for inclusion. 
Beneficiaries for whom Medicare Part B 
FFS switches from being a secondary 
payer to being the primary payer and 
who are identified by CMS as a GLOBE 
Model eligible beneficiary (because all 
criteria are met) would be added to the 
GLOBE Model Eligible Beneficiary List 
when CMS next updates the list and 
remain on the list unless the beneficiary 
is no longer enrolled in Medicare FFS 
or is ineligible for inclusion. No other 
beneficiaries would be added to the 
GLOBE Model Eligible Beneficiary List. 
For example, the following changes 
would not enable beneficiary inclusion 
on the GLOBE Model Eligible 
Beneficiary List after the model starts: 
(1) beneficiaries who were enrolled in 
Medicare Part B at the time CMS creates 
the initial GLOBE Model Eligible 
Beneficiary List prior to the start of the 
model and had an address within CMS’ 
MBD that was not selected as a GLOBE 
Model geographic area then had an 
address change to a GLOBE Model 
geographic area; and (2) newly enrolled 
Medicare Part B FFS beneficiaries with 
an address with a new ZIP Code that did 
not exist at the time that the GLOBE 
Model geographic areas were identified. 
In addition, beneficiaries who were 
identified by CMS as being eligible for 
the comparison group would not be 
eligible for the model cohort. 
Testing the GLOBE Model in this 
population would allow the GLOBE 
Model alternative rebate test to apply to 
a broad set of conditions, clinical 
settings, localities, and manufacturers 
rather than having the model test focus 
on a limited set of conditions, drugs (for 
example, only including drugs approved 
under section 505 of the FD&C Act) or 
a single type of clinical setting (for 
example, only including GLOBE Model 
drugs that are furnished in a physician’s 
office). Defining the population broadly 
and in a manner that fosters a stable and 
consistent model cohort and 
comparison group would allow CMS to 
observe the implications of an 
alternative approach to determining the 
net Medicare payment for GLOBE 
Model drugs across a broad set of 
providers and suppliers and 
beneficiaries, as well as a large set of 
manufacturers. 
D. Proposed Scale for Inclusion of 
GLOBE Model Beneficiaries 
Section 1115A(b) of the Act gives the 
Secretary discretion in the design of 
models, including the geographic reach 
of models. Section 1115A(a)(5) of the 
Act states that the Secretary may elect 
to limit testing of a model to certain 
geographic areas. Testing a model in 
randomly selected geographic areas 
facilitates identification of the 
intervention and comparison groups for 
model implementation. We have 
considered the variation in cost and use 
in the Medicare population of proposed 
GLOBE Model drugs along with other 
aspects of the proposed model design 
and determined that a sufficient 
allocation between intervention and 
comparison groups for achieving precise 
estimates in tests is approximately 25 
percent of Medicare FFS beneficiaries. 
To determine the geographic areas that 
CMS would use to identify 
approximately 25 percent of Medicare 
FFS beneficiaries as GLOBE Model 
eligible beneficiaries, we propose that 
CMS would select geographic regions to 
represent 25 percent of Medicare FFS 
beneficiaries (as described in section 
II.F.2. of this proposed rule). 
E. Proposed Model Participants 
1. Proposed Mandatory Participation of 
Manufacturers of GLOBE Model Drugs 
We propose that model participation 
would be mandatory for all 
manufacturers of GLOBE Model drugs 
(as described in section II.B. of this 
proposed rule) that are furnished to a 
GLOBE Model beneficiary during the 
GLOBE Model performance period. We 
propose that, for purposes of the GLOBE 
Model, ‘‘manufacturer’’ would have the 
same meaning as that term is defined 
and used in section 1847A(c)(6)(A) of 
the Act and 42 CFR 427.20. We note that 
this is consistent with how CMS defines 
‘‘manufacturer’’ for purposes of the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program. We also note that the proposed 
GLOBE Model drugs, as single source 
drugs and sole source biological 
products, usually have one 
manufacturer. However, there could be 
GLOBE Model drugs for which multiple 
manufacturers report ASP data to CMS, 
for example, when there is a repackager 
or relabeler or when more than one 
manufacturer markets a single source 
drug or sole source biological product 
within the U.S. In such cases, we 
propose that all manufacturers of a 
GLOBE Model drug would each be

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260263 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules required to participate in the GLOBE 
Model. 
We propose to define ‘‘GLOBE Model 
participant’’ as a manufacturer of a 
GLOBE Model drug that is required to 
participate in the GLOBE Model in 
accordance with proposed 42 CFR 
513.100. We propose that there would 
be no specific enrollment activities for 
GLOBE Model participants; rather, their 
participation would be effectuated by 
the requirements under the Medicare 
Part B Drug Inflation Rebate Program, 
and where applicable, the application of 
the proposed GLOBE Model calculation 
for the GLOBE Model rebate amount. 
Mandatory participation can enhance 
the generalizability of model results, as 
mandatory model participants may be 
more broadly representative of all entity 
types that could be affected by a model. 
Requiring manufacturer participation in 
the GLOBE Model would allow us to 
observe the experiences of 
manufacturers of drugs with diverse 
characteristics. Further, we believe 
mandatory participation in the GLOBE 
Model would be essential to the model 
test because we believe that, despite the 
potential for the GLOBE Model to lower 
beneficiaries’ financial liability for a 
manufacturer’s Part B rebatable drug 
and reduce financial barriers to access 
such drugs which could increase 
utilization of such drugs, manufacturers 
of proposed GLOBE Model drugs would 
likely not volunteer to participate in this 
model. 
In the proposed 42 CFR 513.100(a), 
we propose to codify that model 
participation would be mandatory for 
all manufacturers of GLOBE Model 
drugs. 
We considered excluding 
manufacturers where the U.S. 
manufacturer may not be the same 
entity that is responsible for sales in 
other countries. Another option we 
considered was to except manufacturers 
that had existing sales or licensing 
agreements with other entities outside 
of the U.S. to sell GLOBE Model drugs 
prior to the publication of this NPRM. 
However, we were concerned about the 
possibility of manufacturers transferring 
responsibilities to other entities to avoid 
model participation. We also considered 
an application process through which a 
manufacturer could qualify for a model 
exemption given their lack of 
responsibility for sales of drugs outside 
of the U.S. However, given the complex 
nature of manufacturer relationships 
outside of the U.S., such an exclusion 
might potentially being too broad, 
diluting CMS’ ability to rigorously 
evaluate the model’s impact on costs 
and quality. Having considered these 
alternatives, CMS is not proposing such 
exclusions. We also seek comment on 
other factors, for example, manufacturer 
size, that CMS could consider 
exempting certain manufacturers while 
maintaining sufficient model 
participation and a robust model test. 
We seek comments on our proposal 
for mandatory participation in the 
GLOBE Model by all manufacturers that 
may be subject to the model (that is, 
manufacturers of Part B rebatable drugs 
that could be designated as GLOBE 
Model drugs pursuant to the criteria in 
proposed 42 CFR 513.130). We also seek 
feedback on whether manufacturers of 
proposed GLOBE Model drugs would 
voluntarily participate in the proposed 
GLOBE Model absent a mandatory 
participation requirement and feedback 
on evidence that could support a 
voluntary participation approach which 
would ensure sufficient model 
participation for a robust model test and 
evaluation during performance year 1 
and thereafter. 
2. Proposed Model Participation 
Requirements 
In 42 CFR 513.100, we propose to 
codify GLOBE Model participant 
requirements during the GLOBE Model 
test period. During the GLOBE Model 
test period described in proposed 42 
CFR 513.100(b), we propose that GLOBE 
Model participants must— 
€Adhere to the proposed GLOBE Model rebate payment instructions as 
proposed in 42 CFR 513.740 and 
established by CMS and its contractors 
responsible for providing rebate reports 
containing GLOBE Model rebate 
amounts and processing payments, 
including without limitation those 
described in proposed 42 CFR 513.500, 
to ensure appropriate and accurate 
GLOBE Model rebate payments; and 
€Participate in GLOBE Model monitoring and evaluation activities in 
accordance with 42 CFR 403.1110(b), 
including collecting and reporting of 
information as the Secretary determines 
is necessary to monitor and evaluate the 
GLOBE Model. 
€If electing to submit international drug net pricing data, adhere to the 
requirements set forth in proposed 42 
CFR 513.610 and the GLOBE Model data 
agreement. 
In addition, for GLOBE Model 
participants that elect to submit 
international drug net pricing data for 
the applicable ASP calendar quarter 
beginning April 1, 2025, we propose 
that such GLOBE Model participants 
would be required to adhere to the 
requirements set forth in proposed 42 
CFR 513.620 and the GLOBE Model data 
agreement prior to the start of 
performance year 1. 
We seek comments on our proposal 
for model participation requirements 
from potential GLOBE Model 
participants. 
We refer readers to section II.G.6. of 
this proposed rule for a discussion of 
the option for eligible manufacturers of 
separately payable Part B single source 
drugs and sole source biological 
products determined to be GLOBE 
Model drugs to voluntarily submit 
manufacturer international net drug 
pricing information to CMS for purposes 
of identifying a per unit Method II 
GLOBE Model benchmark which could 
potentially lower the total GLOBE 
Model rebate amount that a GLOBE 
Model participant would be responsible 
for. If electing to submit international 
drug net pricing data, we propose that 
the manufacturer must adhere to the 
requirements set forth in proposed 42 
CFR 513.610 and in the proposed 
GLOBE Model data agreement as 
described in proposed 42 CFR 513.620. 
3. Standard Provisions 
We propose that the Standard 
Provisions for Innovation Center 
Models, originally established in 42 CFR 
part 512, subpart A and applicable to 
certain Innovation Center models, 
would not apply to the GLOBE Model. 
Given the unique characteristics and 
operational framework of the GLOBE 
Model, we believe it differs 
substantially from most mandatory 
Innovation Center models. Therefore, 
rather than applying the Standard 
Provisions, we propose implementing 
GLOBE-specific requirements that 
would provide the necessary regulatory 
specificity and flexibility to effectively 
test and evaluate the GLOBE Model’s 
innovative approach. 
We propose specific audit, record 
access, and retention requirements for 
manufacturers participating in the 
GLOBE Model. These provisions are 
essential to ensure program integrity, 
enable proper oversight of the model’s 
implementation, and protect the 
interests of Medicare beneficiaries and 
the Federal government. Given the 
unique structure and operational 
characteristics of the GLOBE Model, we 
believe it is necessary to establish clear 
audit rights, record access requirements, 
and retention standards that are 
specifically tailored to this model’s 
framework. 
We propose at § 513.100(d)(1) to 
establish explicit Federal audit rights to 
ensure that CMS, HHS, the Comptroller 
General, and their designees maintain 
comprehensive oversight authority over 
GLOBE Model implementation. This 
provision is necessary to verify 
compliance with model requirements,

identify potential areas for improvement 
or corrective action. 
We propose at § 513.100(d)(2) record 
access requirements would ensure that 
manufacturers maintain and provide 
access to all documentation necessary 
for effective oversight. This includes, 
but is not limited to, records supporting 
the accuracy of voluntarily-submitted 
data and documentation related to CMS 
identified program integrity issues. 
Such access is critical for validating 
manufacturer-reported information and 
ensuring the model operates as 
intended. 
We propose at § 513.100(d)(3) a six- 
year retention period for GLOBE Model- 
related records, with extensions under 
specific circumstances. This timeframe 
aligns with standard Federal audit and 
investigation cycles while providing 
flexibility for situations involving 
disputes, fraud allegations, or special 
retention needs identified by CMS. The 
proposed retention requirements 
balance the need for thorough oversight 
with reasonable administrative burden 
on participating manufacturers. 
We propose at § 513.100(d)(4) that in 
the event we terminate the GLOBE 
Model, we would provide written notice 
to GLOBE Model participants specifying 
the grounds for termination and the 
effective date of such termination. As 
provided by section 1115A(d)(2) of the 
Act termination of the model under 
section 1115A(b)(3)(B) of the Act would 
not be subject to administrative or 
judicial review. 
We seek comment on our proposed 
requirements for audit, record access, 
and record retention, and model 
termination parameters for GLOBE 
Model manufacturers. 
F. Proposed GLOBE Model Test Design 
and Geographic Areas 
1. Proposed Model Test Design 
In 42 CFR 513.110, for the model test 
design, we propose a randomized design 
in which the GLOBE Model geographic 
reach would be determined by selection 
of geographic areas where 
approximately 25 percent of Medicare 
Part B FFS beneficiaries have an address 
of record within CMS’ MBD (as 
determined by CMS as set forth in 42 
CFR 513.120) and CMS would identify 
the selected geographic areas for the 
model start. Model test geographic areas 
would be randomly selected to balance 
the Medicare beneficiary population 
and Medicare expenditures nationwide. 
We also propose that after CMS finalizes 
a rule establishing the GLOBE Model, 
no later than 30 calendar days in 
advance of model start, CMS would 
provide a table on the GLOBE Model 
website that lists the GLOBE Model 
geographic areas by ZIP Code. CMS may 
include other information such as total 
Medicare beneficiary statistics and total 
Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B 
FFS expenditures. This table would 
identify the GLOBE Model geographic 
areas for model start. CMS would not 
change the list of GLOBE Model 
geographic areas by ZIP Code after the 
initial random selection of the model 
geographic areas. For example, during 
the model performance period, if a ZIP 
Code that is within the GLOBE Model 
geographic areas is split or redesignated, 
that ZIP Code would not get reassigned 
to a GLOBE Model geographic area. 
2. Proposed Unit of Analysis 
In developing the proposed GLOBE 
Model, CMS determined that 
conducting the proposed GLOBE Model 
test in the population of Medicare FFS 
beneficiaries who may receive Part B 
rebatable drugs that are included in the 
model (as discussed in section II.C. of 
this proposed rule) would provide the 
best means for testing an innovative 
payment model using the alternative 
rebate calculation. Defining the 
population in this manner would allow 
CMS to assess if the GLOBE Model 
payment test reduced Medicare costs 
while preserving or enhancing quality of 
care, in line with section 1115A(b)(2) of 
the Act across a broad set of providers 
and suppliers and beneficiaries, as well 
as a broad set of manufacturers. 
Learnings from the GLOBE Model 
would inform CMS and other interested 
parties about the effect of applying the 
proposed innovative rebate approach to 
a broad set of drugs on a diverse set of 
beneficiaries and to the Medicare 
program. 
3. Proposed Method for Identification of 
GLOBE Model Geographic Areas 
a. Proposed Geographic Unit of 
Randomization 
We considered establishing the unit of 
geography CMS would use for 
randomization and for evaluation of 
model impacts based on existing well- 
defined geographic units that were 
sufficiently numerous to support 
statistical analysis. Based on CMS’ 
review of existing defined geographic 
units that are suitable for statistical 
purposes, CMS, after consideration of 
alternatives, identified that ZIP Code 
Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) would be an 
appropriate geographic unit for a 
limited scope model and for the 
proposed GLOBE Model specifically. 
ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are 
approximate area representations of 
USPS five-digit ZIP Code service routes 
that the Census Bureau creates using 
whole blocks to present statistical data 
from censuses and surveys. A change in 
site of service due to a difference in 
incentives between the intervention and 
comparison group could bias statistical 
analyses. Given that beneficiary address 
would be the basis for their geographic 
assignment as eligible for the model test 
or comparison group, the site of service 
for the administration of a GLOBE 
Model drug would not bias statistical 
analyses. As a result, the smallest 
practical geographic area is preferred to 
allow for a simpler randomized design, 
that would involve fewer strata or 
weights. A simple random selection of 
small geographic units would achieve 
the desired balance for both observable 
and unobservable characteristics 
between the model test and comparison 
groups. In particular, it would allow us 
to achieve our intended geographic 
scope in terms of approximate share of 
beneficiaries and Medicare spending. 
Therefore, we are proposing to 
identify the GLOBE Model geographic 
areas through a simple random selection 
of 25 percent of all ZIP Code Tabulation 
Areas (ZCTAs) in the U.S., excluding 
the U.S. territories. Specifically, in 42 
CFR 513.110(a), we propose that the 
GLOBE Model geographic areas would 
be identified by ZIP Codes that are 
aligned with ZCTAs that are randomly 
selected by CMS no later than 60 
calendar days prior to the start of the 
model performance period. During the 
model performance period, if a ZIP 
Code that is within the GLOBE Model 
geographic areas is split or redesignated, 
that ZIP Code is not reassigned to a 
GLOBE Model geographic area. 
b. Alternatives Considered 
We also considered the suitability of 
the following as the geographic unit 
from which the GLOBE Model 
geographic areas would be identified: 
(1) ZIP Codes; (2) counties; (3) states; (4) 
Census-defined Core Based Statistical 
Areas (CBSAs) or Combined Statistical 
Areas (CSAs); and (5) Medicare 
Administrative Contractor (MAC) 
regions. ZIP Codes were considered 
because they are part of the beneficiary 
data that is maintained in Medicare 
beneficiary records and are the 
proposed basis for identifying GLOBE 
Model beneficiaries. However, ZIP 
Codes, unlike ZCTAs are not technically 
geographic areas, but represent U.S. 
postal delivery routes. ZIP Codes are 
useful identifiers to link a beneficiary 
record to a specific geographic area but 
are not geographic areas. Counties, 
states and CBSAs were determined to be 
too heterogeneous in their size and

Individual countries differ in the regulatory 
processes and standards governing approval of 
drugs and biologicals. Use of international drug

or to otherwise describe any scientific or regulatory 
relationship between U.S.-approved and non-U.S.- 
approved products.

selected and not selected regions for 
measured and unmeasured factors that 
may be linked to the outcomes for the 
proposed model design. The Medicare 
Administrative Contractor (MAC) 
regions were considered to reduce 
operational complexity but also were 
determined to be too large in size and 
heterogeneous.
94
 
We also considered selecting the 
entire country as the model geographic 
area. However, we concluded that 
limiting geographies would facilitate the 
identification of a representative 
comparison group, which would 
improve CMS’ ability to identify a 
suitable counterfactual for evaluating 
the impact of the GLOBE Model test. 
We also considered starting the model 
with a greater number of geographic 
areas to include up to approximately 50 
percent of Medicare Part B FFS 
beneficiaries in the model eligible 
beneficiary cohort instead of our 
proposal to test the model in geographic 
areas with approximately 25 percent of 
Medicare Part B FFS beneficiaries. We 
also considered an approach of initially 
testing the model in geographic areas 
with approximately 25 percent of 
Medicare Part B FFS beneficiaries and 
then, after initial monitoring 
observations were assessed, increasing 
the model beneficiary cohort to include 
up to approximately 50 percent of 
Medicare Part B FFS beneficiaries by 
including additional geographic areas. 
Under an approach where the number of 
included geographic areas would 
increase during the model performance 
period, we considered that CMS could 
update the table provided on the GLOBE 
Model website to include the complete 
list of GLOBE Model geographic areas 
by ZIP Code over time. We note that 
these alternatives would likely 
necessitate selection of the initial and 
potentially additional geographic areas 
at the same point, prior to model start 
and processes for including additional 
geographic areas. These approaches 
would have the benefit of enhancing the 
model evaluation as a random selection 
of approximately 50 percent of the 
Medicare FFS population would enable 
a 1:1 allocation of the treatment to 
comparison group. 
We considered including the ZCTAs 
of U.S. territories among the geographic 
regions from which the randomly 
selected model geographic area would 
be selected. 
We welcome comment on our 
proposal to use ZCTAs as the basis for 
the model geographic areas, exclude 
U.S. territories, and select the 
geographic area. We welcome comment 
on our proposal to test the model with 
geographic areas that would include 
approximately 25 percent of Medicare 
Part B FFS beneficiaries in the model 
beneficiary cohort and on whether CMS 
should test the model with an 
alternative approach that would include 
additional geographic areas and 
beneficiaries in the model as well as the 
processes that CMS should consider for 
such an approach. 
G. Proposed Model Payment Test for 
GLOBE Model Drugs 
In accordance with section 1847A(i) 
of the Act as codified in 42 CFR 427, 
CMS determines the rebate amount that 
manufacturers of Part B rebatable drugs 
owe to the Federal Supplementary 
Medical Insurance Trust Fund and 
computes adjusted beneficiary 
coinsurance and adjusted Medicare 
payment for Part B rebatable drugs as 
applicable. Under the GLOBE Model, 
we propose to test an alternative rebate 
calculation and an alternative 
calculation to adjust the beneficiary 
coinsurance and Medicare Part B 
payment for GLOBE Model drugs that 
are furnished to GLOBE Model 
beneficiaries. The alternative 
calculation would expand upon the 
current methodology by incorporating 
additional drug pricing information 
while ensuring that beneficiary 
coinsurance and net Medicare payment 
for a service would not exceed what 
they would be absent the model test. 
We propose to base the alternative 
calculation on a per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark that is described in section 
II.G.2. of this proposed rule. To test two 
methods for identifying a per unit 
GLOBE Model benchmark using 
different data sources, we propose that 
the per unit GLOBE Model benchmark 
for a GLOBE Model drug would be, 
subject to available information as 
determined by CMS (as described in 
section II.G.1. of this proposed rule), 
based on the greater of a per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark that 
reflects the lowest country-level price 
among a set of reference countries,
95
(as 
discussed in section II.G.2.a. of this 
proposed rule) or a per unit Method II 
GLOBE Model benchmark that reflects 
the volume-weighted average of the 
manufacturer’s net pricing for sales 
within a set of reference countries based 
on data voluntarily reported by the 
manufacturer (as discussed in section 
II.G.2.b. of this proposed rule), after 
applying an economic adjustment under 
each method.
96
In section II.G.1.e. of 
this proposed rule, we propose the 
criteria that would be applied to 
identify the set of reference countries for 
purposes of identifying the information 
that would be used, as available, by 
CMS to determine the per unit Method 
I GLOBE Model benchmark and the per 
unit Method II GLOBE Model 
benchmark. To the benchmark that is 
greater, in section II.G.3.a. and II.G.3.b. 
of this proposed rule, we propose to 
apply an ‘‘applicable threshold 
percentage’’ and an amount, ‘‘add-on 
percentage amount’’, that would, in general, equal any add-on percentage 
included in the Medicare Part B 
payment limit under section 1847A(b) 
of the Act (which would, in general, be 
the same as the ‘‘specified amount’’ (as 
determined under 42 CFR 427.302(b))) 
to calculate a per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark amount and then determine 
if a GLOBE Model rebate amount would 
apply. The alternative calculation 
would be structured such that the 
GLOBE Model rebate amount would not 
be less than the rebate amount (if any) 
determined under the Medicare Part B 
Drug Inflation Rebate Program as 
codified in 42 CFR part 427. 
As discussed in section II.G.4.a. of 
this proposed rule, we propose that the 
per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount 
for an applicable calendar quarter 
would reflect the result of the 
alternative rebate calculation. That is, 
for a GLOBE Model drug, for an 
applicable calendar quarter, we propose 
that the per unit GLOBE model rebate 
amount would be the greater of: (1) the 
difference between the specified 
amount, as determined under 42 CFR 
427.302(b), and the per unit GLOBE 
Model benchmark amount, as 
determined under 42 CFR 513.400(c); or 
(2) the difference between the specified 
amount determined under 42 CFR 
427.302(b), and the inflation-adjusted 
payment amount determined under 42 
CFR 427.302(g). In section II.G.4.b. of 
this proposed rule, we propose a 
methodology for identifying the 
included billing units of a GLOBE 
Model drug in the total GLOBE Model 
rebate amount calculation. In section

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260266 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules II.G.4.c. of this proposed rule, we 
propose that the total GLOBE Model 
rebate amount for a GLOBE Model drug 
during an applicable calendar quarter 
would be the product of the per unit 
GLOBE Model rebate amount of such 
drug, as determined under 42 CFR 
513.510(a), and the total number of 
GLOBE Model billing units, as 
identified by CMS as set forth in 42 CFR 
513.520 To facilitate the model test, we 
propose that the incremental GLOBE 
Model rebate amount for a GLOBE 
Model drug for an applicable calendar 
quarter would be the product of the 
incremental per unit GLOBE Model 
rebate amount of such drug, as 
determined under 42 CFR 513.510(b), 
and the total number of GLOBE Model 
billing units, as identified by CMS as set 
forth in 42 CFR 513.520. The 
incremental per unit GLOBE Model 
rebate amount would be the amount in 
excess of the per unit rebate amount 
calculated as set forth in 42 CFR 
427.302. That is, as determined in 42 
CFR 513.510(b) and discussed in section 
II.G.4.c. of this proposed rule, the 
incremental per unit GLOBE Model 
rebate amount would be an ‘incremental 
amount’ that taken together with the per 
unit rebate amount calculated as set 
forth in 42 CFR 427.302 would 
represent the per unit GLOBE Model 
rebate amount. To determine GLOBE 
Model billing units, in 42 CFR 513.520, 
CMS proposes to identify the number of 
billing units in accordance with 42 CFR 
427.303(b) where, on the date of service, 
the beneficiary was identified by CMS 
as a GLOBE Model eligible beneficiary 
and for which Medicare Part B FFS 
made separate payment. We also 
propose, in section II.G.4.d. of this 
proposed rule, that the incremental 
GLOBE Model rebate amount may be 
reduced or adjusted in the same manner 
as described in 42 CFR 427 subparts E 
and F, if applicable, when a drug is 
currently in shortage or when there is a 
severe supply chain disruption, and/or 
through the reconciliation or suggestion 
of error process. 
In section II.G.8. of this proposed rule, 
we present two alternative proposals, a 
combined approach and an incremental 
approach, for how CMS would provide 
rebate reports and reconciliation rebate 
reports to GLOBE Model participants, 
and a process for suggestion of error 
when GLOBE Model rebates are owed. 
Under the combined approach, CMS 
would delay Medicare Part B Drug 
Inflation Rebate Program invoicing for 
all manufacturers by up to two months 
and would provide a combined report 
(invoice) to all manufacturers of Part B 
rebatable drugs for both the Medicare 
Part B Drug Inflation Rebate Program 
and the GLOBE Model. Under the 
incremental approach, CMS would use 
a separate invoicing process that would 
run approximately a month after the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program reports and would invoice 
manufacturers of GLOBE Model drugs 
for the total GLOBE Model rebate 
amount using the incremental GLOBE 
Model rebate amount and reconciling 
the portion of the total GLOBE Model 
rebate amount invoiced through the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program processes. We seek comment 
on these alternative approaches for 
reporting, invoicing, and reconciliation 
and intend to adopt only one approach 
for the model. CMS’ intent is to 
establish an efficient approach that 
closely aligns with processes currently 
used by the Medicare Part B Drug 
Inflation Rebate Program and would be 
familiar to manufacturers of Part B 
rebatable drugs. Under these alternative 
approaches, we propose that GLOBE 
Model participants would have access 
to reports, submit a Suggestion of Error 
to CMS, and pay GLOBE Model rebate 
amounts based on the GLOBE Model’s 
alternative calculation in the same 
manner, or substantially similar 
manner, as set forth in 42 CFR 427.504 
with respect to the Medicare Part B Drug 
Inflation Rebate Program. In addition, in 
42 CFR 513.740, we propose that the 
provisions for the deadline and process 
for payment of the rebate amount in 42 
CFR 427.505 would apply to GLOBE 
Model rebate amounts in the same 
manner as they do to Part B drug rebate 
amounts that are calculated under 42 
CFR 427.301. However, to align GLOBE 
Model rebate processes closely with the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program, we have identified the need to 
adjust the timing for providing reports 
and are proposing to use the Innovation 
Center’s waiver authority to do so as 
discussed in section II.G.8. of this 
proposed rule. 
We also propose that, in addition to 
other applicable authorities, the 
provisions for enforcement of 
manufacturer payment of rebate 
amounts of the Medicare Part B Drug 
Inflation Rebate Program and the 
implementing regulations at 42 CFR 
427.600, regarding civil money penalties 
would apply to manufacturers of 
GLOBE Model drugs with respect to 
GLOBE Model rebate amounts. 
The proposed GLOBE Model would 
also test alternative calculations to 
adjust the beneficiary coinsurance and 
Medicare Part B payment for separately 
payable units of GLOBE Model drugs 
that are furnished to GLOBE Model 
beneficiaries (that is, beneficiaries who 
are on the GLOBE Model Eligible 
Beneficiary List as discussed in section 
II.C. of this proposed rule). As discussed 
in section II.G.7. of this proposed rule, 
we propose to use the alternative 
calculation for identifying the per unit 
GLOBE Model benchmark amount to 
identify the GLOBE Model beneficiary 
coinsurance that would be applied as a 
percent to the payment amount for a 
GLOBE Model drug for an applicable 
calendar quarter. To ensure that 
beneficiary financial liability for 
coinsurance amounts for GLOBE Model 
drugs under the GLOBE Model would 
not be more than it would be absent the 
model test, for a calendar quarter, we 
propose that CMS would compare a per 
unit GLOBE Model benchmark amount 
(that would be calculated in advance of 
the calendar quarter, with limited 
exceptions in cases of error, as 
determined by CMS, to the applicable 
inflation-adjusted payment amount as 
determined under 42 CFR 427.302(g) 
and the lesser of those amounts would 
be used in the computation of the 
GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance 
percentage and the GLOBE Model 
Medicare Part B FFS payment amount 
for separately payable units of the 
GLOBE Model drug furnished to GLOBE 
Model beneficiaries during the 
applicable calendar quarter. The GLOBE 
Model beneficiary coinsurance would 
only be applicable to separately payable 
units of GLOBE Model drugs that are 
furnished to the Medicare Part B FFS 
beneficiaries who are, for the date of 
service, on the GLOBE Model Eligible 
Beneficiary List in use by the Medicare 
claims processing systems on the date a 
claim was processed, as determined by 
CMS. When the GLOBE Model reduced 
beneficiary coinsurance applies to units 
of GLOBE Model drugs furnished to 
Medicare Part B FFS beneficiaries who 
are included in the GLOBE Model 
beneficiary cohort, the provider or 
supplier would reduce the amount of 
coinsurance charged to the beneficiary 
and the portion of the Medicare Part B 
allowed amount that would be payable 
by Medicare Part B would be adjusted 
upwards. 
For a discussion on the proposed 
approach for the GLOBE Model 
monitoring and evaluation, we refer 
readers to sections II.L. and II.P. of this 
proposed rule, respectively.

Method I GLOBE Model benchmark, 
based on available data from existing 
data sources (as described in section 
II.G.2.a. of this proposed rule). This 
section of this proposed rule also 
discusses the proposed data and 
information that eligible manufacturers 
would have the option to voluntarily 
submit to CMS, which would, if 
submitted and determined to meet 
completeness criteria, be used to 
identify the per unit Method II GLOBE 
Model benchmark (as described in 
section II.G.2.b. of this proposed rule). 
We propose that the availability of data 
and information, its completeness, and 
use for purposes of the GLOBE Model 
would be determined solely by CMS. In 
section II.G.2.e. we discuss the proposed 
criteria and process CMS would use to 
identify the non-U.S. countries that 
would be included in the set of 
reference countries for the GLOBE 
Model for purposes of identifying 
international drug pricing information 
available in existing data sources and 
calculating the per unit Method I 
GLOBE Model benchmark (as described 
in section II.G.2.a. of this proposed rule) 
and the per unit Method II GLOBE 
Model benchmark (as described in 
section II.G.2.b. of this proposed rule). 
a. Existing Data Sources for 
International Drug Pricing Information 
To identify the per unit Method I 
GLOBE Model benchmark (as described 
in section II.G.2.a. of this proposed 
rule), we propose to rely on existing 
data sources available to CMS that 
contain international drug pricing 
information, including pricing 
information, sales, and/or volume data 
(for example, package size, and number 
of items or packages sold), as available, 
in order to optimize operational 
efficiency and inform the identification 
of the per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark amount including in the 
absence of voluntarily submitted 
manufacturer net pricing data and 
information (which we propose to use to 
inform the identification of the per unit 
Method II GLOBE Model benchmark as 
described in section II.G.2.b. of this 
proposed rule). Within available data 
sources, sales and list prices may be 
based on ex-manufacturer prices 
(sometimes referred to as ex-factory 
price), that represent actual or 
calculated prices paid to the 
manufacturer by wholesalers and other 
distributors, retail prices, prices for 
other distribution channels, or a 
combination thereof. Data sources have 
proprietary collection, and projection 
methodologies to harmonize data across 
countries. For example, data sources 
may use proprietary adjustment factors 
to facilitate comparison of different 
pricing level information or apply 
proprietary projection methodology to 
estimate data available for a sample of 
distribution channels to obtain a 
projected value for the entire country. 
Confidential manufacturer rebates 
would not likely be accounted for 
within these available data sources; 
therefore, existing sources for 
international drug sales data may 
overstate actual prices realized by 
manufacturers. On balance, we believe 
existing data sources are adequate for 
purposes of identifying country-level 
prices and a per unit Method I GLOBE 
Model benchmark (as described in 
section II.G.2.a. of this proposed rule), 
particularly because we are proposing 
that eligible manufacturers would have 
the option to voluntarily submit 
international drug net pricing data to 
CMS that could potentially be used 
instead to identify the per unit GLOBE 
Model benchmark. 
We have assessed several existing 
data sources to determine the 
availability and sufficiency of 
international drug pricing information. 
These data sources include those made 
available by private companies, which 
may include data reported by 
manufacturers or data obtained through 
a review of publicly filed material by 
manufacturers in other countries or in 
the U.S. Specifically, we reviewed 
proprietary global pharmaceutical 
pricing data sources that include drug 
pricing data for a large diverse set of 
pharmaceutical products (that are the 
types of pharmaceutical products that 
could be covered under Medicare Part 
B) for more than 30 countries. These 
data sources vary with respect to the 
scope (such as products, manufacturer 
level, market level data, countries), and 
periodicity of updates (such as daily, 
monthly, quarterly). For example, 
IQVIA MIDAS
97
is an IQVIA 
proprietary information service which 
integrates IQVIA’s national audits into a 
globally consistent view of the 
pharmaceutical market, and provides 
estimated product volumes of registered 
medicines, trends and market share 
through retail and non-retail channels. 
IQVIA MIDAS
98
includes detailed drug 
product information, such as drug 
name, molecule, strength, dosage form, 
pack size, manufacturer, generic 
product classification (such as non- 
generic or generic), biologic 
classification (such as biosimilar or 
reference biological products), market 
information (such as country, 
distribution channel, the Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) 
classification,
99
sales data, standard 
units, extended units, number of packs), 
pricing information (such as price per 
pack, price per unit, derived average list 
price), temporal information (such as 
month, quarter, year of sale), and other 
information.
100
IQVIA MIDAS is 
updated monthly and retains extensive 
historical data for 33 countries. 
Another potential data source we 
assessed is GlobalData Pharmaceutical 
Prices (POLI)
101
which includes three 
price levels (ex-manufacturer, 
wholesalers, and retail) for at least 80 
countries at the pack level 
(pharmaceutical name, generic name, 
dosage form, strength and number of

Individual countries differ in the regulatory 
processes and standards governing approval of 
drugs and biologicals. Use of international drug

or to otherwise describe any scientific or regulatory 
relationship between U.S.-approved and non-U.S.- 
approved products. 
countries), and is another potential data 
source. 
These data sources, if available, 
would likely provide adequate 
information to inform CMS’ 
identification of a Method I GLOBE 
Model benchmark for the vast majority 
of proposed GLOBE Model drugs (as 
discussed in section II.G.2.a. of this 
proposed rule). 
Another data source option we 
considered would be for CMS to 
construct price comparisons from public 
sources of each country. However, we 
believe this would be cumbersome and 
we may not have all the information 
necessary for CMS to routinely identify 
a Method I GLOBE Model benchmark 
for a broad set of proposed GLOBE 
Model drugs. 
In 42 CFR 513.310(c), we propose to 
use one or more existing data sources 
for international drug pricing available 
to CMS to identify the per unit Method 
I GLOBE Model benchmark for a GLOBE 
Model drug. Specifically, we propose to 
use one or more data sources available 
to CMS at least 60 business days prior 
to the start of the first applicable 
calendar quarter for which the drug is 
a GLOBE Model drug to identify if the 
per unit Method I GLOBE Model 
benchmark is available. As proposed in 
42 CFR 513.310(c)(1)(ii), such data 
sources would utilize a standardized 
method for identifying drugs across 
countries within the data source, such 
as using an internationally recognized 
method for identifying scientific and 
nonproprietary product names and a 
standard method for identifying dosage 
form, route of administration such as 
using an internationally recognized 
nomenclature for pharmaceutical forms 
like the New Form Code classification 
(that, at a minimum, distinguishes 
among injectable, oral, and other forms 
of a drug), and strength. For example, 
the data source might use the 
International Nonproprietary Names 
(INN), as applicable.
103
We are 
proposing that the data source must use 
a standardized method for identifying 
drug names, dosage forms, and route of 
administration because the process that 
CMS proposes to use to identify the 
country-level prices to identify the per 
unit Method I GLOBE Model benchmark 
requires mapping between the data 
source’s method for identifying drug 
names, dosage forms and route of 
administration to the HCPCS Level II 
codes that are associated with GLOBE 
Model drugs. We are proposing that the 
data source must use a standardized 
method for identifying strength because 
this could be used to identify the 
quantity of drug and the billing units. 
Further, we propose that the one or 
more data sources that we would use 
would contain international drug 
pricing information and the 
corresponding volume data (for 
example, number of items, packages, or 
units sold) or data sources with only 
pricing information, where applicable. 
We propose that the pricing information 
in the data sources would include sales 
data (which may be based on ex- 
manufacturer prices, sometimes referred 
to as ex-factory prices) that represent 
actual or calculated prices paid to the 
manufacturer by wholesalers and other 
distributors, or retail prices that 
represent actual or calculated sales for 
retail purchasers, or prices paid by other 
purchasers in the distribution channels 
(such pricing information must be 
expressed in U.S. currency. We also 
propose the data source would use a 
standard method based on regulatory 
approval pathways to identify U.S. 
originator drugs and international 
originator drugs (such as brand name 
products, reference listed drug, or 
reference products), and U.S. non- 
originator drugs and international non- 
originator drugs
104
(such as generics, 
biosimilars, biocomparable products, 
reference product equivalents, or off- 
patent products). In addition, we 
propose that the one or more data 
sources we would use must have 
mechanisms in place to maintain, 
update, and correct, if necessary, the 
data source on at least a quarterly basis. 
Further, we propose that the data 
sources we would use must be 
maintained by organizations that seek to 
limit the lag inherent in data to no more 
than 90 days from the end of the 
calendar quarter for which drug pricing 
information is compiled to the time that 
the organization makes such updates 
available to users of the data source. 
Based on CMS assessment of the 
available data sources, the current lag 
may be up to 90 days. We believe the 
limit of no more than 90 days provides 
sufficient time for organizations to 
collect data, perform data checks, and 
update their data sources, and for CMS 
to obtain and use the most current, 
timely available data for the purposes of 
the GLOBE Model. 
Whenever possible, to identify the per 
unit Method I GLOBE Model benchmark 
for a GLOBE Model drug, we propose to 
use international drug pricing 
information from two calendar quarters 
prior to the first applicable calendar 
quarter to which the total GLOBE Model 
rebate amount would apply since the 
ASP payment limits that apply to that 
calendar quarter (and are generally the 
basis for the specified amount set forth 
in 42 CFR 427.302(b)) are based on 
manufacturers’ U.S. sales from two 
calendar quarters prior. For GLOBE 
Model drugs to be included on the 
GLOBE Model drug list for the first 
calendar quarter of performance year 1 
(that is, the calendar quarter beginning 
October 1, 2026), as proposed in 42 CFR 
513.130, CMS would use international 
drug pricing information from the 
second calendar quarter of 2026 (that is, 
the ASP calendar quarter beginning on 
April 1, 2026). In addition, except for 
extracted data used by CMS to identify 
the most recent per unit Method GLOBE 
Model benchmark from January 1, 2024 
to December 31, 2024, we propose to 
use international drug pricing 
information from no earlier than the 
second calendar quarter of 2025 (that is, 
the ASP calendar quarter beginning on 
April 1, 2025) to minimize the 
possibility of having no international 
drug pricing information to calculate the 
per unit Method I GLOBE Model 
benchmark while limiting the 
possibility that historical data would 
not reasonably approximate 
international drug pricing information 
for the applicable ASP calendar quarter 
and mitigating the potential effect of 
manufacturers’ limiting the availability 
of international drug pricing 
information during the GLOBE Model 
performance period. If international 
drug pricing information from two 
calendar quarters prior to the first 
applicable calendar quarter to which the 
total GLOBE Model rebate amount 
would apply are not used, we propose 
that CMS would use international drug 
pricing information from the most 
recent ASP calendar quarter for which 
data are available. 
b. Proposed Hierarchy for Using 
Existing Data Sources 
To identify available data sources for 
purposes of identifying the per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark for 
each GLOBE Model drug, we propose 
that CMS would use the following 
hierarchy that we propose to codify in 
42 CFR 513.310(c)(2): 
€A data source with drug specific sales and volume data for the applicable 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:53 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\23DEP2.SGM 23DEP2

country that is included in the set of 
reference countries identified by CMS in 
accordance with 42 CFR 513.310(b). 
€Except for extracted data used by CMS to identify the most recent per unit 
Method GLOBE Model benchmark from 
January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024, 
a data source with drug specific sales 
and volume data for any prior ASP 
calendar quarter beginning on or after 
April 1, 2025 from at least one country 
that is included in the set of reference 
countries identified by CMS in 
accordance with 42 CFR 513.310(b) 
when drug specific sales and volume 
data are not available for the applicable 
ASP calendar quarter from at least one 
country that is included in the set of 
reference countries identified by CMS in 
accordance with 42 CFR 513.310(b). 
€The extracted data used by CMS to identify the most recent per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark 
available in a document posted on the 
GLOBE Model website. We note that 
could include a data source with drug 
specific sales and volume data from 
January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024, 
from at least one country that is 
included in the set of reference 
countries identified by CMS in 
accordance with 42 CFR 513.310(b). 
€A data source with drug specific ex- manufacturer price (sometimes referred 
to as ex-factory price) data for the 
applicable ASP calendar quarter from at 
least one country that is included in the 
set of reference countries identified by 
CMS in accordance with 42 CFR 
513.310(b). 
€A data source with drug specific list price data (for example, the price made 
available to wholesalers) for the 
applicable ASP calendar quarter from at 
least one country that is included in the 
set of reference countries identified by 
CMS in accordance with 42 CFR 
513.310(b). 
In cases when there is more than one 
data source meeting the requirements in 
42 CFR 513.310(c)(2) for a GLOBE 
Model drug for a reference country, we 
propose to use the data source at the 
highest level of the hierarchy that 
contains information from the highest 
number of countries, and, if available, 
incorporates discounts, rebates, or other 
price concessions into its drug pricing 
information. Our proposed approach for 
using existing data sources would allow 
CMS to use different data sources for 
different GLOBE Model drugs over 
different quarters. We propose that CMS 
would select a data source and extract 
the data as available from that data 
source, and we would not make 
adjustments to account for differences 
between the data source selected and 
other available data sources. For 
example, for GLOBE Model drug X, 
suppose we identify Data Source 1 that 
meets the requirements of 42 CFR 
510.310(c)(2) where Data Source 1 
contains sales and volume data for 
GLOBE Model drug X for the applicable 
ASP calendar quarter from 7 out of a 
total of 19 reference countries, Data 
Source 2 contains sales and volume data 
for GLOBE Model drug X for the 
applicable ASP calendar quarter from 8 
reference countries, Data Source 3 
contains sales and volume data from 
one quarter prior to the applicable ASP 
calendar quarter for GLOBE Model drug 
X from 9 reference countries, and Data 
Source 4 contains list price information 
for the applicable ASP calendar quarter 
from all included countries. In this 
scenario, in accordance with our 
proposed approach, we would use 
information solely from Data Source 2, 
and we would not use Data Sources 1, 
3, or 4 for that applicable calendar 
quarter. 
We note that in that scenario, if CMS 
were unable to identify a data source for 
international drug pricing information 
for GLOBE Model drug X for a reference 
country, the lowest per unit country- 
level price would be identified using the 
information available. That is, a 
country-level price for each of the 
reference countries would not be 
required and CMS would solely use the 
available information for as many 
reference countries as possible. Further, 
we would not combine data from 
different data sources to identify 
international drug pricing information 
for GLOBE Model drug X across 
countries. 
c. Alternatives Considered for Using 
Existing Data Sources 
In cases when there is more than one 
data source meeting the requirements in 
proposed 42 CFR 513.310(c)(3) for a 
GLOBE Model drug, or in cases when 
there is more than one data source 
meeting the requirements in proposed 
42 CFR 513.310(c)(3) for a GLOBE 
Model drug and for the same number of 
countries, we considered two 
alternatives. Under one alternative, we 
would first identify the data source at 
the highest level of the data source 
hierarchy that has the most pricing 
information available and use the lowest 
value of the pricing information 
available within that data source even if 
international drug pricing information is 
available from other reference countries 
within another data source. We also 
considered using all the available data 
sources for a drug and calculating the 
average of the pricing information 
available across all the data sources. 
Because these alternative approaches 
could result in cases where available 
international drug pricing information 
for a drug from a reference country 
would not be used or cases where 
different types of pricing information for 
a drug from a reference country would 
be combined, we are not proposing 
them at this time and may reconsider 
the potential value of these approaches 
based on feedback from interested 
parties and further information 
gathering. We also seek comments on 
these alternatives and how CMS could 
use the most comprehensive 
international pricing information 
available. 
We are interested in better 
understanding the existing data sources 
for international drug pricing 
information that may be available to 
CMS and steps we could follow to best 
use such data sources for the GLOBE 
Model payment test. We welcome 
comments on the methods or processes 
CMS could consider when more than 
one existing data source is available at 
the highest level of the hierarchy to 
determine which data source is more 
comprehensive, as well as on how CMS 
might refine the hierarchy for potential 
use of more than one data source for a 
GLOBE Model drug or to incorporate 
new data sources that may become 
available during the GLOBE Model 
performance period. 
d. Proposed Voluntary Submission of 
International Drug Net Pricing Data 
Under the GLOBE Model, if a 
manufacturer elects to submit 
international drug net pricing data for a 
GLOBE Model drug, to be considered by 
CMS for identifying the per unit Method 
II GLOBE benchmark, we propose that 
the manufacturer would be required to 
execute a data agreement that must be 
effective prior to the manufacturer’s first 
submission of voluntary international 
drug net pricing data. The data 
agreement would establish terms, 
conditions, and requirements, including 
data completeness and validity 
requirements, and compliance 
responsibilities. In 42 CFR 513.620(b), 
we propose that, once the data 
agreement is effective, it would remain 
applicable for the duration of the 
GLOBE Model unless either the 
manufacturer or CMS terminates the 
agreement. We considered having data 
agreements that were effective for a 
shorter duration such as one 
performance year or for one quarter of 
a performance year. However, we were 
concerned that allowing manufacturers 
to opt in and out of reporting for each 
quarter would potentially result in 
manufacturers choosing to report only if

the Method II benchmark would be 
higher than the Method I benchmark. 
Additionally, given the operational 
complexity associated with conducting 
reporting on a quarterly basis, CMS 
believes it would be less burdensome 
for CMS and manufacturers to enter one 
data agreement for the duration of the 
GLOBE model. Under the data 
agreement, manufacturers may make 
submissions for one or more GLOBE 
Model drugs for any applicable ASP 
calendar quarter. For each submission, 
we propose that the manufacturer must 
include ‘‘applicable international 
analog’’, defined in 42 CFR 513.600 as 
a non-US analog whose scientific or 
nonproprietary name, dosage form, and 
route of administration (if applicable) 
align with a GLOBE Model drug and 
that are sold in one or more reference 
countries identified in 42 CFR 
513.310(b) during the applicable ASP 
calendar quarter, excluding those 
identified in their respective country as 
a generic or biosimilar biological 
product according to the country’s own 
regulations.
105
We propose that 
manufacturers would use data that (1) 
represents the price of the international 
originator drugs; (2) have complete 
package size information; (3) have a 
strength; and (4) represents a dosage 
form that could be described by the 
GLOBE Model drug’s HCPCS Level II 
code descriptor, including route of 
administration (if applicable). For 
example, if the HCPCS Level II code 
descriptor includes the word injection, 
manufacturers would provide 
applicable international analog net 
pricing data for products that are 
administered by injection (for example, 
data for liquid and dry powder for 
injection products would be submitted 
whereas data for tablets that are 
administered orally would not be 
submitted). Further information on the 
manufacturer voluntary submission is 
described in section II.G.6. of this 
proposed rule. We also propose that 
manufacturers who elect the option to 
submit international drug net pricing 
data for an applicable calendar quarter 
during the GLOBE Model performance 
period would submit data that 
corresponds to the applicable ASP 
calendar quarter for that applicable 
calendar quarter. The applicable ASP 
calendar quarter is the calendar quarter 
two quarters prior to the applicable 
calendar quarter. For example, for the 
proposed first applicable calendar 
quarter of model performance year 1 
that would begin on October 1, 2026, 
the applicable ASP calendar quarter 
would be April 1, 2026, to June 30, 
2026. We propose that submission of the 
data must occur no later than 30 days 
after the end of the applicable ASP 
calendar quarter. For example, for the 
proposed first applicable calendar 
quarter of performance year 1, 
manufacturers would have to submit 
data to CMS no later than July 30, 2026, 
for it to be considered submitted timely 
and, if determined to be acceptable by 
CMS, be considered by CMS for 
purposes of identifying the per unit 
Method II GLOBE Model benchmark. 
The manufacturer submitted data would 
include data for the entire applicable 
ASP calendar quarter (April 1, 2026 to 
June 30, 2026). This would mean 
manufacturers would have to establish 
an effective data agreement no later than 
July 30, 2026. 
We propose that CMS would conduct 
a verification review for validity to 
determine whether the manufacturer’s 
submission meets the submission 
requirements as proposed in 42 CFR 
513.610, which is necessary for CMS to 
determine whether the submission 
represents an ‘‘applicable submission’’ 
to identify a per unit Method II GLOBE 
Model benchmark. To conduct the 
verification review, CMS would—(1) 
review the data for completeness to 
ensure all required data elements are 
present; (2) verify the validity of the 
data, including verifying that the 
submitted sales and volume data and 
calculated international net pricing 
values are greater than zero and adhere 
to data format requirements (for 
example, values are numeric and are 
rounded at the third decimal place); and 
(3) as part of verifying the validity of the 
data, CMS will assess the extent to 
which the submission reflects 
international drug net pricing in the 
reference countries using all available 
data sources and information, including 
data sources used to identify the per 
unit Method I GLOBE Model benchmark 
and previous submissions by the 
manufacturer for the same GLOBE 
Model drug (as determined by CMS). 
For example, existing data shows U.S. 
ex-manufacturer prices are, on average, 
278 percent higher than prices in other 
OECD countries, with U.S. originator 
drugs exhibiting an even greater 
difference of 422 percent. Therefore, we 
expect, on average, that reported 
international net prices for applicable 
international analogs would be, in 
general, on average, less than the 
average sales price that is reported to 
CMS and below or similar to prices 
contained within existing international 
drug pricing information data sources. 
We also expect that manufacturer 
submitted international drug net pricing 
data for the applicable ASP calendar 
quarter would be within a reasonable 
margin of previous submissions by the 
manufacturer for the same set of 
applicable international analogs (if data 
exists), meaning we do not expect 
manufacturer submitted international 
drug net pricing data to increase beyond 
pricing in existing international data 
pricing information data sources. We 
welcome comments on other methods 
CMS could consider for verification. 
The proposed process for how 
manufacturers would submit 
international drug net pricing data to 
CMS is discussed in section II.G.6. of 
this proposed rule. 
e. Proposed Criteria and Process for 
Identifying the Set of Reference 
Countries 
In this section, we propose the criteria 
and process CMS would use to identify 
the non-U.S. countries that would be 
included in the set of reference 
countries for the GLOBE Model for 
purposes of identifying international 
drug pricing information available in 
existing data sources and calculating the 
per unit Method I GLOBE Model 
benchmark as described in section 
II.G.2.a. of this proposed rule and the 
per unit Method II GLOBE Model 
benchmark as described in section 
II.G.2.b. of this proposed rule. 
Our proposed approach aims to select 
a large set of reference countries that are 
economically similar to the U.S., and 
have reasonably comparable purchasing 
power to the U.S. Specifically, we 
propose that CMS would identify a set 
of reference countries that are non-U.S. 
Organization for Economic Co-operation 
and Development members (that is, non- 
U.S. OECD-member countries)

as of

and

as 
determined by CMS. For each country, 
at 42 CFR 513.310(b) we propose to use 
the real GDP per capita and the annual 
real GDP based on purchasing power 
parity (PPP), as estimated and available 
in the CIA World Factbook for the year 
2024 and available as of October 1, 
2025. Further, while the CIA online 
World Factbook is updated daily, the 
underlying data such as GDP and PPP 
are reported no more frequently than 
annually, based on a July 1 mid-point. 
Therefore, our proposal to identify the 
set of reference countries using data 
available as of October 1, 2025, in the 
CIA World Factbook would mean that 
the set of reference countries would be 
identified using real GDP information 
from 2024. There are other existing 
sources for GDP per capita data besides 
the CIA World Factbook, including the 
World Bank,
109
and the International 
Monetary Fund.
110
Upon examining 
these sources, we noted that the GDP 
data across these sources are highly 
associated with one another. We 
propose using the CIA World Factbook 
as our source for real GDP per capita 
and real GDP data as it is issued by a 
U.S. government agency and includes 
data for countries that are economically 
comparable to the U.S. CMS seeks 
comments on the proposed data sources 
as well as other data sources considered. 
Given that the identified set of 
countries are economically comparable 
to the U.S. based on real GDP per capita 
in 2024 and aggregate real GDP in 2024, 
we propose that the identified set of 
reference countries would remain the 
same throughout the 5-year GLOBE 
Model performance period, even if the 
CIA World Factbook shows that, based 
on more recent information, a country 
would no longer meet the criteria for the 
set of reference countries during any 
performance year of the model. We 
propose to codify the criteria that CMS 
would use once to identify the set of 
reference countries for purposes of the 
GLOBE Model in 42 CFR 513.310(b). 
To illustrate the potential set of 
reference countries that would result if 
the proposed criteria for identifying the 
set of reference countries are adopted in 
a final rule establishing the GLOBE 
Model, we applied the proposed criteria 
(as set forth in 42 CFR 513.310(b)) using 
CIA World Factbook data that were 
available on October 1, 2025 and 
identified the following potential set of 
reference countries: Australia, Austria, 
Belgium, Canada, Czechia, Denmark, 
France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, 
Japan, Netherlands, Norway, South 
Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and 
the United Kingdom (see Table 5). All 
19 countries are economically 
comparable to the U.S. with real GDP 
per capita in 2024 (the most recent data 
available) falling between 63 and 170 
percent of U.S. real GDP per capita in 
2024 and aggregate real GDP in 2024 
exceeding $400 billion and are non-U.S.

BILLING CODE 4120–01–C 
We believe that applying a minimum 
of 60 percent of the U.S. real GDP per 
capita and $400 billion aggregate real 
GDP strikes a balance between having 
too low a real GDP per capita threshold 
and including data from countries with 
economies that are substantially 
different from the U.S. while also not 
having such a high real GDP per capita 
threshold that the set of reference 
countries would be very small. For 
example, a real GDP per capita 
threshold of 80 percent of the U.S. real 
GDP per capita could result in the set of 
reference countries only including 9 
countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, 
Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, 
Sweden, and Switzerland). By contrast, 
a real GDP per capita threshold of 40 
percent of the U.S. real GDP per capita 
could result in a set of 23 reference 
countries including the 19 countries 
noted above as well as Chile, Poland, 
Portugal, and Turkey. We believe that 
our proposed approach would result in 
a set of reference countries that are 
economically similar, have reasonably 
comparable purchasing power to the 
U.S., and generally have existing 
international drug pricing information 
that is available. 
We considered different criteria to 
identify economy size, including 
aggregate nominal and real GDP below 
$400 billion, between $400 billion and 
$1 trillion, between $1 and $2 trillion, 
and greater than $2 trillion. Lower 
aggregate real GDP thresholds would 
include more countries, while a 
threshold above real GDP $2 trillion 
would result in a small number of 
countries. For example, using the CIA 
World Factbook data for 2024 that were 
available on October 1, 2025, only eight 
non-U.S. OECD member countries— 
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, 
Spain, South Korea, and the United 
Kingdom—have economies larger than 
$2 trillion in real terms. We also 
considered criteria based on 
intergovernmental political and 
economic forums like the Group of 
Seven (G7) countries that include 
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, 
and the United Kingdom, or the Group 
of 20 (G20).

I .f. of this proposed rule for additional details). The GDP (PPP) adjuster is used to calculate the per unit Method I GLOBE Model benchmark and per unit Method II GLOBE Model benchmark (see section 11.G.2. of this proposed rule). 60273 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules 112

GDP (PPP) means purchasing power parity 
(PPP)-adjusted per capita gross domestic product 
(GDP). 
We also considered alternative 
approaches to our proposed criteria for 
identifying the set of reference 
countries. Specifically, we considered 
including all non-U.S. OECD member 
countries or including countries based 
on factors such as the World Health 
Organization (WHO) recognition as a 
Stringent Regulatory Authority (to be 
replaced by the WHO-listed authority or 
WLA) and intellectual property 
protections.

We also considered 
including only countries that may 
represent large markets for drug 
manufacturers such as all countries in 
the European Union, Canada, Japan, and 
United Kingdom. However, we do not 
believe that these approaches would be 
as objective and predictable for 
purposes of identifying the GLOBE 
Model benchmark amount. 
We also considered alternatives that 
would phase-in countries or would 
adjust the set of reference countries over 
time based on a defined set of 
characteristics, such as real GDP per 
capita or average drug prices. However, 
at this time, we believe that phasing in 
countries over time or adjusting the set 
of reference countries periodically 
would create instability within the 
model test and could cause potential 
negative impacts on GLOBE Model 
participants (for example, creating 
confusion regarding voluntary data 
submission), GLOBE Model 
beneficiaries (for example, greater 
variation in coinsurance from calendar 
quarter to calendar quarter) and the 
Medicare Part B program (for example, 
additional administrative costs that 
would reduce potential model savings). 
Despite our concerns about potential 
negative impacts that could occur if the 
set of reference countries is not held 
constant during the 5-year GLOBE 
Model performance period as stated in 
this section of this proposed rule, we 
welcome comment on the potential 
benefits and drawbacks of establishing a 
threshold for removing a country from 
the set of reference countries (that CMS 
would identify using CIA World 
Factbook data available as of October 1, 
2025 for the year 2024) at certain points 
during the model performance period. 
Specifically, we seek comment on the 
proposed criteria to select the list of 
reference countries and whether or not 
to revise the list of reference countries. 
We also welcome comments on the 
processes and timing that would be 
necessary to operationalize a change to 
the set of reference countries that would 
minimize impacts on the model test. 
f. Proposed Data and Methodology for 
Identifying the GDP (PPP) Adjuster 
In this section we discuss the 
proposed data sources and calculation 
to identify the GDP (PPP) adjuster, 
which CMS proposes to codify at 42 
CFR 513.430. Sections II.G.2. and II.G.6. 
of this proposed rule discuss the 
application of the GDP (PPP) adjuster in 
calculating the per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark. 
For each country in the set of 
reference countries identified as 
determined in 42 CFR 513.310(b) and 
discussed in section II.G.1.e. of this 
proposed rule, CMS proposes to use the 
most recent data on real GDP per capita 
based on purchasing power parity for a 
country available in the CIA World 
Factbook at the start of the applicable 
ASP calendar quarter (as defined in 42 
CFR 513.20) as determined by CMS. 
CMS proposes to use the following 
calculation to determine the GDP (PPP) 
adjuster: divide the U.S. real GDP per 
capita by the country’s real GDP per 
capita and round the result to the third 
decimal place. In calculating the GDP 
(PPP) adjuster CMS proposes to apply 
the following limitations: (1) the 
country’s real GDP per capita and U.S. 
real GDP per capita data from the same 
year; and (2) the real GDP per capita 
used must be for the same year as the 
data used to calculate the per unit 
country-level price (as defined in 42 
CFR 513.410), or the most recent earlier 
year available; and (3) in cases where 
the resulting ratio is less than 1.000, the 
GDP (PPP) adjuster is set to 1.000. 
Table 5 presents an illustrative GDP 
(PPP) adjuster using 2024 data from the 
CIA World Factbook. As noted in 
section II.G.6. of this proposed rule, 
CMS intends to publish a supplemental 
document on the GLOBE Model website 
with details on which GDP (PPP) 
adjuster would be used for each 
applicable ASP calendar quarter. To 
establish the GDP (PPP) adjuster for 
each ASP calendar quarter, CMS would 
use the most recently available 
information from the CIA World 
Factbook for each reference country. 
CMS would publish this GDP (PPP)- 
adjuster at the beginning of each 
applicable calendar quarter. 
2. Proposed Methodology To Identify 
the Per Unit GLOBE Model Benchmark 
The proposed GLOBE Model would 
test alternative calculations to those 
used by CMS to determine the Part B 
inflation rebate amount that 
manufacturers of Part B rebatable drugs 
owe to the Medicare Supplementary 
Medical Insurance Trust Fund, adjusted 
beneficiary coinsurance, and the 
adjusted Medicare payment for Part B 
rebatable drugs, as applicable, pursuant 
to section 1847A(i) of the Act as 
codified in 42 CFR 427. Under the 
GLOBE Model, these alternative 
calculations would expand upon the 
current methodology by incorporating 
additional drug pricing information (as 
described in section II.G.1. of this 
proposed rule) while ensuring that 
beneficiary coinsurance and net 
Medicare Part B payment would not 
exceed what they would be absent the 
model test. In this section of this 
proposed rule, we propose to test two 
alternative calculation approaches using 
different data sources for international 
drug pricing information and methods 
to identify the per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark. Specifically, we propose 
that, subject to available information as 
determined by CMS, the per unit 
GLOBE Model benchmark for a GLOBE 
Model drug for an applicable quarter 
during the model performance period 
would be based on the greater of—(1) a 
‘‘per unit Method I GLOBE Model 
benchmark’’ that would reflect the GDP 
(PPP) adjusted
114
lowest country-level 
price among a set of reference countries 
at a baseline using existing data sources 
for international drug pricing 
information for the applicable ASP 
calendar quarter as available to and 
calculated by CMS (this benchmark 
would be identified by CMS for the first 
applicable calendar quarter for the 
GLOBE Model drug and remains in 
place for each applicable calendar 
quarter thereafter until the end of the 
model performance period, as proposed 
in section II.G.2.a. of this proposed rule; 
or (2) a ‘‘per unit Method II GLOBE 
Model benchmark’’ that would reflect 
the volume-weighted average of the GDP 
(PPP) adjusted manufacturer’s 
international drug net pricing for sales 
among a set of reference countries for 
the applicable ASP calendar quarter 
based on data calculated and voluntarily 
reported by eligible manufacturers to 
CMS on a quarterly basis (this 
benchmark would only be available and 
identified by CMS if acceptable data 
was submitted by all manufacturers of 
the GLOBE Model drug, as determined 
by CMS), as proposed in section II.G.2.b. 
of this proposed rule. 
As further described in section 
II.G.2.a. of this proposed rule, to 
identify the per unit Method I GLOBE 
Model benchmark and determine if such 
benchmark is available for purposes of 
identifying the per unit GLOBE Model benchmark for a GLOBE Model drug, we VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:53 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\23DEP2.SGM 23DEP2

When there is more than one manufacturer 
submission for a GLOBE Model drug for an 
applicable calendar quarter, CMS proposes to 
calculate a volume-weighted average GDP (PPP) 
adjusted net price per HCPCS billing unit using 
data across all of the applicable submissions using 
the steps described in section II.G.2.b. of this 
proposed rule. 
propose that, in general, CMS would 
follow these steps (subject to data 
availability): identify available 
international drug pricing information 
for the set of reference countries for the 
first applicable ASP calendar quarter (or 
prior calendar quarter, if necessary) for 
which the drug is a GLOBE Model drug; 
apply data checks; convert the available 
international drug pricing information 
to align with the HCPCS Level II code 
long descriptor associated with the 
GLOBE Model drug; identify per unit 
GDP (PPP) adjusted country-level prices 
using the applicable methodology for 
the available international drug pricing 
information for a country (for example, 
calculating a volume-weighted average 
per unit price when pricing and volume 
data are available or calculating an 
average per unit price when pricing data 
are available but volume data are not 
available in the selected data source); 
and identify the lowest per unit GDP 
(PPP) adjusted country-level price as the 
per unit Method I GLOBE Model 
benchmark. The results of the interim calculation steps would be rounded to 
the fifth decimal place and the last step 
would be rounded to the third decimal 
place. 
As further described in section 
II.G.2.b. of this proposed rule, to 
identify the per unit Method II GLOBE 
Model benchmark and determine if such 
benchmark is available for purposes of 
identifying the per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark, we propose that, in general, CMS would follow these steps for a 
GLOBE Model drug for each applicable 
calendar quarter (subject to data 
availability): identify voluntary 
manufacturer-submitted international 
drug net pricing data that was timely 
submitted and meets requirements for 
completeness and validity (as set forth 
in 42 CFR 513.610 and described in 
section II.G.6. of this proposed rule); 
identify the volume-weighted average 
per unit price as the per unit Method II 
GLOBE Model benchmark. As set forth 
in 42 CFR 513.420, the manufacturer 
across country volume-weighted average 
GDP (PPP) adjusted net price per 
HCPCS billing unit data element 
(further discussed in section II.G.6. of 
this proposed rule) would be calculated 
by the manufacturer and would be 
rounded to the third decimal place prior 
to being submitted to CMS.
115
As 
discussed in section II.G.6. of this 
proposed rule, CMS is proposing that 
manufacturers would have two data 
submission options—streamlined and 
limited—for the international drug net 
pricing data that would be voluntarily 
submitted. Refer to section II.G.6. of this 
proposed rule for additional details on 
the two manufacturer data submission 
options. 
In 42 CFR 513.410, we propose that, 
prior to model start in accordance with 
proposed 42 CFR 513.410, CMS would 
identify the per unit Method I GLOBE 
Model benchmark for each GLOBE 
Model drug for the first applicable 
calendar quarter of performance year 1. 
These benchmarks would remain in 
place until the end of the model 
performance period. Similarly, 
subsequently, for each Part B rebatable 
drug that becomes a GLOBE Model drug 
during the performance period, CMS 
would identify the per unit Method I 
GLOBE Model benchmark for the first 
applicable calendar quarter for which 
the drug is a GLOBE Model drug and 
that benchmark would remain in place 
for the remaining applicable calendar 
quarters until the end of the model. 
Thus, quarterly for each GLOBE Model 
drug, after CMS would identify the per 
unit Method I GLOBE Model benchmark 
(as previously calculated at baseline, if 
available) and the per unit Method II 
GLOBE Model benchmark (as most 
recently calculated, if available), CMS 
would compare the per unit Method I 
GLOBE Model benchmark and the per 
unit Method II GLOBE Model 
benchmark to identify which is greater; the greater of the two would be 
identified as the per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark for the GLOBE Model drug for the applicable calendar quarter. If 
only the per unit Method I GLOBE 
Model benchmark is available for the 
GLOBE Model drug (manufacturer has 
not submitted international drug net 
pricing data), then the per unit Method 
I GLOBE Model benchmark becomes the 
per unit GLOBE Model benchmark for 
the GLOBE Model drug for the 
applicable calendar quarter. 
As discussed in section II.G.3. of this 
proposed rule, we propose how CMS 
would use the identified per unit 
GLOBE Model benchmark to calculate 
the per unit GLOBE Model benchmark amount for the GLOBE Model drug for that applicable calendar quarter which 
would be used to calculate the 
alternative rebate amounts, coinsurance 
adjustments, and adjusted Medicare 
payments to providers. 
We believe that our proposed 
approach to identify the per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark for 
a GLOBE Model drug once, based on 
available international drug pricing 
information, is necessary to protect the 
integrity of the model test and minimize 
corresponding impacts if the 
international drug pricing information 
in available data sources become 
artificially inflated by shifts in 
manufacturers’ pricing and rebate 
practices, such as a shift to higher prices 
along with greater rebates that do not 
change the net pricing realized by 
manufacturers. Given the potential ease 
with which available international drug 
pricing information could be potentially 
manipulated by manufacturers by 
changing their pricing and rebate 
strategies and/or by taking actions that 
would restrict data sources’ ability to 
source or update international drug 
pricing information in a manner that 
represents actual prices and given that 
such behavioral change would impede 
CMS’ ability to test the model, we 
believe it is essential to establish the per 
unit Method I GLOBE Model benchmark 
once at a baseline (at the time the drug 
enters the model) and use that 
benchmark for the duration of the 
GLOBE Model. 
Therefore, under our proposal, prior 
to model start in accordance with 
proposed 42 CFR 513.410, CMS would 
identify the per unit Method I GLOBE 
Model benchmark for each GLOBE 
Model drug for the first applicable 
calendar quarter of performance year 1. 
These benchmarks would remain in 
place for the duration of the model. 
Similarly, subsequently, for each Part B 
rebatable drug that becomes a GLOBE 
Model drug during the performance 
period, CMS would identify the per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark for 
the first applicable calendar quarter for 
which the drug is a GLOBE Model drug 
and that benchmark would remain in 
place for the remaining applicable 
calendar quarters until the end of the 
model. 
a. Proposed Methodology To Identify 
the Per Unit Method I GLOBE Model 
Benchmark Using Existing Data Sources 
In this section of this proposed rule, 
we propose a methodology that CMS 
would use to identify the per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark for 
a GLOBE Model drug for the first 
applicable calendar quarter that the Part 
B rebatable drug is a GLOBE Model drug 
using existing data sources that are 
described in section II.G.1. of this 
proposed rule. As proposed in section 
II.G.1.b. of this proposed rule, CMS 
would use available international drug 
pricing information data sources in 
accordance with the proposed hierarchy 
to select the data source used to identify 
a per unit country-level price for each 
country that is included in the set of

Individual countries differ in the regulatory 
processes and standards governing approval of 
drugs and biologicals. Use of international drug 
pricing information in the proposed GLOBE Model 
should not be interpreted to connote FDA approval 
or to otherwise describe any scientific or regulatory 
relationship between U.S.-approved and non-U.S.- 
approved products. 
reference countries (as specified in 42 
CFR 513.310(b)). 
Specifically, we propose that CMS 
would first identify available data 
sources, available to CMS at least 60 
business days prior to the start of the 
applicable calendar quarter, meeting the 
requirements in proposed 42 CFR 
513.310(c), that have international drug 
pricing information for the scientific or 
nonproprietary name for the GLOBE 
Model drug for the applicable ASP 
calendar quarter for any country that is 
included in the set of reference 
countries identified in proposed 42 CFR 
513.310(b). Then for each country that 
is included in the set of reference 
countries, CMS would select a data 
source at the highest level of the 
hierarchy as available, extract 
international drug pricing information 
for the scientific or nonproprietary 
name for the GLOBE Model drug, and 
using available data identify a per unit 
country-level price or determine that a 
per unit country-level price was 
unavailable for that reference country. 
To select a data source at the highest 
level of the hierarchy as available and 
identify available international drug 
pricing data for the GLOBE Model drug, 
we propose that CMS would align the 
GLOBE Model drug’s HCPCS Level II 
code long description (including dosage 
form and if applicable, route of 
administration) with the data sources’ 
standardized method for identifying 
scientific names or nonproprietary 
names and dosage forms, as applicable. 
CMS would then extract available drug 
pricing information for that country 
from the selected international drug 
pricing information data source. We 
propose that CMS would extract and use 
data that, as determined by CMS, (1) 
represent the price of a U.S. originator 
drug or international originator drug (as 
applicable for data for a country); (2) 
have complete package size information; 
(3) represent scientific or 
nonproprietary name and dosage form 
that could be described by the GLOBE 
Model drug’s HCPCS Level II code 
descriptor, including route of 
administration (if applicable); and (4) 
have strength data.
116
We propose to 
only extract and use data for dosage 
form that could be described by the 
GLOBE Model drug’s HCPCS Level II 
code long descriptor (as determined by 
CMS) because a HCPCS Level II code 
may only describe drug products that 
are a certain type of formulation, such 
as short-acting intravenously 
administered drug products, and a data 
source’s standardized method for drug 
names could apply more broadly such 
that a different formulation, such as a 
long-acting suspension for 
intramuscular injection, might be 
extracted if our proposed limitation was 
not adopted. For example, we would 
examine the data source’s methods for 
describing dosage form and only extract 
data where the description is complete 
and clear, as determined by CMS. We 
would also examine the data source’s 
methods for describing products in 
terms of being sold as a U.S. originator 
drug, international originator drug, or 
other indicator that would allow CMS to 
not extract and use pricing information 
for products that are identified as 
generic or biosimilar biological 
products. 
To avoid unintentionally using 
extracted pricing information for drug 
products that do not align with the 
GLOBE Model drug’s HCPCS Level II 
code descriptor, we would apply data 
checks to ensure that the extracted data 
aligns with the HCPCS Level II code 
descriptor for the GLOBE Model drug 
and information about formulations and 
package sizes sold. Based on our 
experience using existing international 
drug pricing information data sources, 
we propose to perform additional data 
checks to identify and discard extracted 
data when the sales or volume data are 
not greater than zero or the product 
information (for example, product 
strength or package size) is inconsistent 
or not verifiable with available product 
labeling or product approval 
information for the GLOBE Model drug. 
CMS proposes to exclude these records 
because these records could 
inappropriately contribute to the 
calculation of country-level prices. 
In addition, we propose to make 
adjustments to align volume data with 
the HCPCS Level II code dosage 
descriptor, when necessary, as 
determined by CMS. For example, if we 
find that a data source from which we 
obtain international drug pricing 
information makes adjustments for 
overfill, we would make adjustments to 
the data that we extract from such 
source so that the extracted data would 
be used in a manner that is comparable 
to how CMS uses ASP data to calculate 
payment limits. In these cases, we 
propose to identify the quantity of drug 
without counting overfill based on the 
package labeling or other 
documentation related to product 
licensing within a country. There could 
be other cases where we may find it 
necessary to make adjustments to align 
the extracted data with a HCPCS Level 
II code descriptor for a GLOBE Model 
drug. For example, there may be cases 
where a selected data source shows 
package size information that is 
standardized (for example, ‘‘per each’’ 
which may not clearly distinguish the 
quantity of drug) or inconsistent with a 
manufacturer’s publicly available 
information that describes their drug 
product or the amount of active drug in 
a presentation level. In such cases 
where we confirm a difference and an 
appropriate conversion method, we 
would make adjustments in how the 
pricing, sales and volume data are 
associated with the HCPCS Level II code 
descriptor, as necessary, before 
calculating the country-level price, such 
as limiting the number of HCPCS billing 
units assigned. HCPCS billing units, as 
defined in 42 CFR 513.20, are the 
standardized measurement quantities 
(such as milligrams, milliliters, or 
individual items) used to determine 
how medical services, procedures, 
supplies, and drugs are quantified and 
billed for reimbursement under the 
Healthcare Common Procedure Coding 
System, where the billing quantity is 
calculated by dividing the total amount 
administered or provided by the unit of 
measurement defined for that specific 
HCPCS Level II code. For the purposes 
of the GLOBE Model, this can be 
determined by dividing the quantity of 
drug in the package by the HCPCS 
dosage (quantity of drug represented in 
one HCPCS billing unit, which is the 
identifiable quantity of a drug or 
biological product associated with a 
billing and payment code (for example, 
a HCPCS Level II code), as established 
by CMS). Based on our experience, we 
believe that such cases would be 
uncommon, and, in most cases, the 
appropriate conversion would be 
straightforward. We note that there 
could be additional cases when 
adjustments would be necessary if 
international drug pricing data sources 
that are available show prices, sales or 
volume data that are inconsistent with 
other reliable data sources (for example, 
product information available on 
manufacturers’ websites), include 
multiple ingredients for a single drug 
product and the data source presents 
information in a different manner from 
the HCPCS Level II code descriptor, or 
are in error (for example, the package 
size represents the maximum volume of 
a vial instead of the volume or quantity 
of drug in a package as indicated in 
product labeling). 
In addition, to carefully align 
extracted data with the HCPCS Level II

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260276 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules code for a GLOBE Model drug, CMS 
would assess whether there are 
differences in the international pricing 
information attributed to data source 
coding or country-specific 
considerations to determine whether the 
available international pricing 
information consistently and accurately 
aligns with the HCPCS Level II code 
long descriptor. An example of a data 
coding difference that CMS would 
consider equivalent is if some available 
international pricing information 
records describe the packaging as a 
disposable vial in some countries but in 
others, the packaging is described as a 
single-dose vial in other records. 
Because disposable vials are single-dose 
vials, in this case, CMS would 
determine that disposable vials and 
single-dose vials are equivalent 
packaging and would not consider such 
variations to be inconsistent with 
product information. An example of 
country-specific considerations that 
CMS would take into account is 
differences in drug naming standards 
across countries. For example, although 
not a GLOBE Model drug, in the U.S. 
and Japan, acetaminophen is the 
scientific or nonproprietary name while 
in most other countries, instead of being 
called acetaminophen, it is referred to as 
paracetamol. In this type of case, CMS 
would consider acetaminophen and 
paracetamol equivalent drugs when a 
data source’s standardized method for 
identifying scientific names or 
nonproprietary names treats them as 
equivalent or alternative names. 
To further avoid the potential that 
some international drug pricing 
information available in existing data 
sources may not represent actual prices 
and, if included in the calculation of 
country-level prices, could result in a 
per unit country-level price that would 
not be a reasonable benchmark, at 42 
CFR 513.410(a)(4)(i)(A) we propose to 
remove pricing information at the 
dosage form and strength level for a 
country that falls below 5 percent of the 
average price in the U.S. Specifically, 
prior to calculating the per unit country- 
level price, CMS would calculate an 
average price for a reference country 
only using pricing information for the 
same scientific or nonproprietary name, 
dosage form, and strength using 
extracted international drug pricing 
information (that was not discarded due 
to data checks). If the resulting average 
price for a country for a dosage form and 
strength falls below 5 percent of the 
average U.S. price for the scientific or 
nonproprietary name (across all dosage 
forms and strength), CMS would remove 
the pricing information for that dosage 
form and strength and would not use 
such data to calculate the per unit 
country-level price. 
For purposes of this step, which 
would compare and then remove certain 
pricing information from the calculation 
of per unit country-level prices for the 
Method I alternative calculation 
approach, CMS proposes to identify an 
‘‘average U.S. price’’ using pricing 
information from the selected data 
source used for the reference country for 
the applicable ASP calendar quarter, if 
available, otherwise CMS would use the 
most recently published Medicare Part 
B payment limit (minus the add-on 
amount, that is, in general 100 percent 
ASP) for the HCPCS Level II code for the 
GLOBE Model drug for the calendar 
quarter before the applicable ASP calendar quarter. Because existing data 
sources for international drug pricing 
information have an unique approach 
for presenting drug pricing information 
and for making data within the data 
source useful for cross-country 
comparison, we believe that, if 
available, using drug pricing 
information for the applicable ASP 
calendar quarter that would be extracted 
from the same data source for both the 
reference country and the U.S. would be 
a more consistent and appropriate 
approach for this proposed purpose 
than using available ASP-based 
Medicare payment limit information, 
which, given time limitations, would be 
for a prior calendar quarter. 
Nevertheless, if the selected data source 
for the reference country did not contain 
available U.S. pricing information for 
the GLOBE Model drug, we believe that 
using available ASP data would be a 
reasonable alternative and would be 
suitable for purposes of removing 
pricing information that is low and may 
not reflect actual prices for a dosage 
form and strength. 
We considered several alternatives, 
including not proposing to remove 
potentially inappropriately low pricing 
information, only using U.S. pricing 
information from external data sources, 
and applying a higher threshold (for 
example, removing pricing information 
that would fall below 10 percent of the 
average price in the U.S.). Using 
available international drug pricing 
information, we estimate that a 5 
percent threshold, on average, could 
raise the benchmark about 1 percent 
overall. For a few potential GLOBE 
Model drugs, the impact would raise the 
benchmark to a more reasonable level 
and would still likely result in a 
country-level price for a reference 
country being available. At a 10 percent 
threshold level, we observed that 
reference country pricing information 
that appears consistent with U.S. 
pricing information would be removed 
which suggests that a lower threshold 
would be more appropriate. We also 
considered whether to compare 
reference country pricing information at 
the country level across all products 
regardless of dosage forms and 
strengths. This approach was more 
likely to result in a country-level price 
being unavailable, due to data for one 
dosage form and strength impacting the 
overall average price for all dosage 
forms and strengths when the data were 
combined. 
For a GLOBE Model drug where CMS 
has selected a data source and extracted 
available international drug pricing 
information for an international drug for 
a country that is included in the set of 
reference countries, we propose that 
CMS would use the following steps to 
identify a per unit country-level price 
by country, apply the GDP (PPP) 
adjuster (as determined pursuant to 43 
CFR 513.430) and identify the lowest 
per unit GDP (PPP) adjusted country- 
level price as the per unit Method I 
GLOBE Model benchmark: 
Step 1: Apply data checks (as 
described above and in proposed 42 
CFR 513.410(a)(2)) and discard or adjust 
data as applicable as determined by 
CMS. 
Step 2: Convert the volume data to the 
unit of measurement delineated in the 
HCPCS Level II code descriptor (for 
example, mg, ml, mcg, etc.), as 
applicable, using volume and strength 
information as proposed in 42 CFR 
513.410(a)(3). Note that volume data 
includes both information about the 
quantity of drug in the product 
packaging and, when available, the 
amount of sales. 
Step 3: Adjust the volume data (as 
proposed in 42 CFR 513.410(a)(3)(i)), as 
applicable, before converting the 
volume data to the unit of measurement 
delineated in the GLOBE Model drug’s 
HCPCS Level II code descriptor when 
the data source shows the package size 
for a presentation level that is 
inconsistent with the manufacturer’s 
information about that product, as 
determined by CMS. 
Step 4: Limit the number of HCPCS 
billing units (as proposed in 42 CFR 
513.410(a)((3)(ii)) when— 
€The available information (such as package labeling) indicates a limited 
quantity of drug to be used from the 
presentation level; and 
€Depending on the HCPCS Level II code description, the HCPCS dosage is 
per therapeutic dose, per dose, or per 
treatment.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260277 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules Step 5: By country, identify the per 
unit country-level price using the 
calculation that is applicable. 
a. If an international drug pricing 
information data source with sales and 
volume data is used, the applicable 
calculation is as follows (as proposed in 
42 CFR 513.410(a)(4)(i)): 
(1) CMS removes pricing information 
at the dosage form and strength level for 
a country that falls below 5 percent of 
the average price in the U.S. as set forth 
in 42 CFR 513.410(d). 
(2) Using remaining data, CMS sums 
the adjusted volume data for the 
presentation levels for the applicable 
international analog (as specified in 42 
CFR 513.600). 
(3) Using remaining data, CMS sums 
the total sales for the presentation levels 
for the applicable international analog 
(as specified in 42 CFR 513.600) (that 
remain after performing the data 
checks). 
(4) CMS divides the sum determined 
in Step 5a.(3) by the sum determined in 
Step 5a.(2), resulting in an average 
country-level price per unit, where the 
unit is the same unit delineated in the 
HCPCS Level II code descriptor. 
b. If an international drug pricing 
information data source with ex- 
manufacturer or list prices is used (that 
is, the data source does not contain 
available volume data and the pricing 
data is a positive value (note that data 
that have missing, negative, or zero 
values would be discarded by data 
checks)), the applicable calculation is as 
follows (as proposed in 42 CFR 
513.410(a)(4)(ii)): 
(1) For each extracted ex- 
manufacturer or list price, CMS 
calculates the number of HCPCS billing 
units in the presentation level by 
dividing the quantity of drug in the 
presentation level by the quantity of 
drug represented in the HCPCS dosage 
from the HCPCS Level II code 
descriptor. 
(2) CMS divides the ex-manufacturer 
or list price, as applicable, by the 
number of HCPCS billing units in the 
presentation level, resulting in a price 
per unit where the unit is the same unit 
delineated in the HCPCS Level II code 
descriptor. 
(3) CMS removes pricing information 
at the dosage form and strength level for 
a country that falls below 5 percent of 
the average price in the U.S. as set forth 
in 42 CFR 513.410(d)(2). 
(4) CMS calculates the sum of the 
price per unit calculated in Step 5b.(2) 
for each ex-manufacturer or list price 
that was identified as available and not 
removed in step 5b.(3). 
(5) CMS divides the sum calculated in 
Step 5b.(4) by the number of ex- 
manufacturer or list prices that were 
summed in Step 5b.(4), resulting in an 
average country-level price per unit 
where the unit is the is the same unit 
delineated in the HCPCS Level II code 
descriptor. 
Step 6: Calculate the per unit GDP 
(PPP) adjusted country-level price by 
multiplying the average per unit 
country-level price calculated in Step 5 
by the applicable GDP (PPP) adjuster for 
such country as set forth in 43 CFR 
513.430 (and illustrated in Table 5) and 
round the result at the fifth decimal 
place. 
Step 7: After identifying the available 
per unit GDP (PPP) adjusted country- 
level price by country, we propose that 
CMS would identify the lowest per unit 
GDP (PPP) adjusted country-level price, 
round that amount at the third decimal 
place, and identify the result as the per 
unit Method I GLOBE Model 
benchmark. 
In developing our proposal to base the 
per unit Method I GLOBE Model 
benchmark on the identified lowest per 
unit GDP (PPP) adjusted country-level 
price we considered that a 2024 analysis 
comparing drug prices in the U.S. and 
other countries concluded that U.S. 
prices for brand drugs were at least 3.22 
times as high as prices in OECD 
countries. This study did not account 
for economic differences across markets. 
We believe that testing this model by 
selecting the lowest per unit GDP (PPP) 
adjusted country-level price would 
more reasonably align the per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark 
with both the sum of beneficiary 
coinsurance amounts and net Medicare 
spending amounts for GLOBE Model 
drugs under the model and international 
prices for GLOBE Model drugs, which 
would represent an alternative Part B 
inflation rebate amount calculation that 
could reduce access barriers to GLOBE 
Model drugs and improve quality of 
care for beneficiaries with deficits in 
care and generate potential savings for 
the Medicare program and such 
beneficiaries. As such, we believe that 
the proposed GLOBE Model fits within 
the statutory authority under section 
1115A of the Act which authorized the 
Secretary to test models to reduce 
program expenditures while preserving 
or enhancing the quality of care 
furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. 
CMS believes that using the lowest 
GDP (PPP) adjusted country-level price 
after applying data checks that would 
remove pricing information at the 
dosage form and strength level for a 
country that falls below at least 5 
percent of prices in the U.S. would more 
closely represent the actual net prices 
for the drug when available existing 
international drug pricing information 
data sources are used because these data 
sources may not include pricing 
information that reflects all price 
concessions. Further, the lowest 
country-level price, when volume data 
is available from existing international 
drug pricing information data sources, 
corresponds to how much of that 
country’s sales volume is sold at that 
price. CMS considered using an across 
country average instead of the lowest 
country-level price. However, 
calculating an across country average of 
prices that does not represent actual 
prices paid for a GLOBE Model drug in 
the reference countries would not 
closely reflect the typical price in a 
country, particularly considering a 
result that would include data that was 
GDP (PPP) adjusted. 
CMS also considered using the n 
lowest country-level price or the average 
of the n lowest GDP (PPP) adjusted country-level prices. As noted above, 
these methods do not closely represent 
the actual price of the drug and the 
corresponding volume. We also 
considered an alternative approach to 
identify the per unit Method I GLOBE 
Model benchmark that would involve 
applying a gross to net sales estimate in 
aggregate to available international drug 
pricing information. However, gross to 
net sales data is generally not publicly 
available at the drug level making this 
approach impractical for CMS to test 
and would not yield a transparent 
benchmark metric. 
In our proposed methodology to 
determine the per unit Method I GLOBE 
Model benchmark amount, we opted to 
adjust the country-level prices to 
account for economic differences among 
countries, such as GDP per capita, prior 
to the comparison of the available 
country-level prices to identify the 
lowest country-level price for a GLOBE 
Model drug. We believe that adjusting a 
single country-level price using a GDP 
(PPP) adjuster is reasonable. 
Specifically, given that the reference 
countries are economically comparable 
to the U.S., we would expect that 
adjusting for country wealth differences 
based on PPP adjusted GDP would more 
likely result in appropriate international 
pricing information that align with other 
country-specific dynamics. 
We seek comment on our proposed 
approach and steps to identify the per 
unit Method I GLOBE Model benchmark 
once in advance of the first applicable 
calendar quarter for the GLOBE Model 
drug and potential alternative 
approaches, including available data 
sources, methods for identifying an 
international pricing benchmark using 
existing international drug pricing

We also seek comment on whether we 
should consider data sources that report 
only in local currency, which could 
require CMS to perform a currency 
conversion in addition to a GDP (PPP) 
adjustment. We also seek comment on

which it may be appropriate to make 
any adjustments based on other factors

b. Proposed Methodology for Identifying 
the Per Unit Method II GLOBE Model 
Benchmark Using Manufacturer 
Submitted Data 
In this section of this proposed rule, 
we propose a methodology that CMS 
would use to identify the per unit 
Method II GLOBE Model benchmark for 
a GLOBE Model drug for an applicable 
calendar quarter using voluntarily 
manufacturer-submitted international 
drug net pricing data (as described in 
section II.G.2.b. of this proposed rule) 
when such data is available and meets 
acceptance criteria (as described in 
section II.G.6. of this proposed rule), as 
determined by CMS. 
To identify available manufacturer- 
submitted international drug net pricing 
data for a GLOBE Model drug, we 
propose that CMS would use accepted 
manufacturer-submitted international 
drug net pricing data (that is, an 
‘‘applicable submission’’ for a GLOBE 
Model drug as set forth in 42 CFR 
513.610) for an applicable ASP calendar 
quarter that aligns with the applicable 
calendar quarter and the GLOBE Model 
drug’s HCPCS Level II code long 
description (including scientific or 
nonproprietary name, dosage form, and 
route of administration (if applicable)). 
We propose to only use data for 
dosage forms that can be described by 
the GLOBE Model drug’s HCPCS Level 
II code long descriptor (as determined 
by CMS) because a HCPCS Level II code 
may only describe drug products that 
are a certain type of formulation, such 
as short-acting intravenously 
administered drug products, and 
manufacturer-submitted international 
drug net pricing data for an 
international drug could apply more 
broadly such that information for a 
different formulation, such as a long- 
acting suspension for intramuscular 
injection, might be available and used if 
our proposed limitation was not 
adopted. To avoid unintentionally using 
data for formulations that do not align 
with the GLOBE Model drug’s HCPCS 
Level II code descriptor, we would 
apply data checks to ensure that the 
accepted manufacturer-submitted 
international drug net pricing data 
aligns with the HCPCS Level II code 
descriptor for the GLOBE Model drug. 
Because manufacturers would submit 
net pricing data at the HCPCS Level II 
code billing unit level and would not 
include overfill in the net pricing data 
and because applicable submissions 
would meet a completeness and validity 
check, we do not foresee the need to 
make adjustments to the manufacturer- 
submitted international drug net pricing 
data for a GLOBE Model drug. 
Because we are proposing that 
manufacturers have the option to submit 
international drug net pricing data for a 
GLOBE Model drug and we anticipate 
the potential situation where CMS 
would not identify available data, in 
such cases, we propose that, in the 
absence of available manufacturer- 
submitted net pricing information for a 
GLOBE Model drug for an applicable 
ASP calendar quarter, CMS would 
identify that the per unit Method II 
GLOBE Model benchmark was 
unavailable for an applicable calendar 
quarter. 
Therefore, when there is one 
manufacturer submission of 
international drug net pricing data for a 
GLOBE Model drug for an applicable 
calendar quarter, we propose that the 
across country volume-weighted average 
GDP (PPP) adjusted net price per 
HCPCS billing unit data element (as 
defined in 42 CFR 513.20 and further 
discussed in section II.G.6. of this 
proposed rule), submitted by the 
manufacturer and accepted by CMS 
according to subpart G, would be 
identified as the per unit Method II 
GLOBE Model benchmark. Further, we 
propose that, when there is more than 
one manufacturer submission of 
international drug net pricing data for a 
GLOBE Model drug for an applicable 
calendar quarter, we propose to 
calculate a volume-weighted average 
using data across all of the applicable 
submissions. For example, when a 
manufacturer and a repackager submit 
international drug net pricing data and 
CMS accepts both manufacturer 
submissions, CMS would calculate a 
volume-weighted average using the 
across country volume-weighted average 
GDP (PPP) adjusted net price per 
HCPCS billing unit data elements and 
the volume data element (that is 
submitted in HCPCS billing units). 
Specifically, we propose that CMS 
would apply the following steps: 
Step 1: Separately, for each applicable 
submission, CMS multiplies the across 
country volume-weighted average GDP 
(PPP) adjusted net price per HCPCS 
billing unit by the sum of the volume in 
billing units. 
Step 2: CMS sums the amounts 
calculated in Step 1. 
Step 3: CMS calculates the total 
volume by summing the billing units 
across all applicable submissions. 
Step 4: CMS divides the sum 
calculated in Step 2 by the total volume 
calculated in Step 3. The resulting 
volume-weighted average would be 
rounded at the third decimal place and 
would be identified as the per unit 
Method II GLOBE Model benchmark. 
However, we also propose that when 
a manufacturer submission for an 
applicable calendar quarter as set forth 
in 42 CFR 513.20 is either not accepted 
by CMS as set forth in 42 CFR 513.610 
or was not submitted by all 
manufacturers of the GLOBE Model 
drug, CMS would identify that the per 
unit Method II GLOBE Model 
benchmark is unavailable for such applicable calendar quarter. That is, 
when there is more than one 
manufacturer of a GLOBE Model drug, 
all manufacturers of such GLOBE Model 
drug would have to voluntarily submit 
net pricing data for the applicable ASP 
calendar quarter and each of such data 
submissions would have to be 
acceptable (as per 42 CFR 513.400(b)(3)) 
in order for CMS to identify a per unit 
Method II GLOBE Model benchmark. 
In cases where CMS does not identify 
a per unit Method II GLOBE Model benchmark, the per unit GLOBE Model benchmark would only be available if a per unit Method I GLOBE Model 
benchmark was available. In our proposed methodology to 
determine the per unit Method II GLOBE 
Model benchmark, we opted to allow 
manufacturer-submitted international 
drug net pricing data to be adjusted 
using a GDP (PPP) adjuster, as specified 
by CMS. We believe, based on our 
proposed criteria for the set of reference 
countries, that all of the countries 
included in the set of reference 
countries would be economically 
comparable with the U.S. and each 
other reference country (that is, each 
reference country’s GDP per capita 
would be no less than 60 percent of U.S. 
GDP per capita) and would have a 
comparable economy size (real GDP 
greater than $400 billion). Previous 
research comparing international prices 
of U.S. originator drugs and 
international originator drugs show that 
prices can vary widely across countries. 
For example, among the countries listed 
in Table 5, the U.S. originator prices are 
between 339 and 703 percent higher

We expect that the per unit Method II 
GLOBE Model benchmark would tend to 
be higher than the per unit lowest 
country-level price identified under our 
proposed methodology for the per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark— 
before CMS would apply the proposed 
GDP (PPP) adjuster—because it reflects 
the price variations in reference 
countries and accounts for them through 
a volume-weighted price. As such, we 
believe this approach would be a strong 
incentive for manufacturers to conduct 
data gathering, analyses, and reporting 
activities related to voluntary 
manufacturer submission of 
international drug net pricing data as 
discussed in section II.G.6. of this 
proposed rule. Our goal is to encourage 
manufacturers to report international 
drug net pricing data (that is reflective 
of the actual transaction prices 
internationally) for GLOBE Model drugs 
to CMS for purposes of the GLOBE 
Model to enhance the model test and 
inform CMS’ model monitoring and 
evaluation activities. We welcome 
comments or data on the extent to 
which the per unit Method II GLOBE 
Model benchmark would tend to be 
higher than the per unit Method I 
GLOBE Model benchmark, as well as 
comments on situations when the per 
unit Method II GLOBE Model 
benchmark may be lower than the per 
unit Method I GLOBE Model 
benchmark. 
We welcome comment on our 
proposed methodology to identify the 
per unit Method II GLOBE Model 
benchmark for a GLOBE Model drug for an applicable calendar quarter. 
c. Alternatives Considered 
Instead of proposing that, for a 
GLOBE Model drug, CMS would 
identify the per unit Method I GLOBE Model benchmark once for the first 
applicable calendar quarter for such 
GLOBE Model drug and CMS would not 
reassess that benchmark, we considered 
an alternative that would allow CMS to 
revise the benchmark prospectively, no 
more frequently than quarterly, only if 
such benchmark would be lower than 
the currently applicable per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark. For 
example, prior to model start in 
accordance with proposed 42 CFR 
513.410, CMS would identify the per 
unit Method I GLOBE Model benchmark 
for each GLOBE Model drug for the first 
applicable calendar quarter of 
performance year 1. These benchmarks 
would remain in place for the duration 
of the model performance period unless 
CMS identifies a lower GDP (PPP) 
adjusted country-level price for the 
GLOBE Model drug using available data 
sources that meet the requirements in 
proposed 42 CFR 513.310. Similarly, for 
drugs that become GLOBE Model drugs 
during the performance period, CMS 
would identify the per unit Method I 
GLOBE Model benchmark for the first 
applicable calendar quarter for which 
the drug is a GLOBE Model drug and 
that benchmark would remain in place 
for the remaining applicable calendar 
quarters until the end of the model 
performance period unless CMS 
identifies a lower GDP (PPP) adjusted 
country-level price for the GLOBE 
Model drug. Under this alternative, if a 
per unit Method I GLOBE Model 
benchmark was prospectively revised, the revised benchmark would remain in 
place for the remaining applicable 
calendar quarters until the end of the 
model performance period unless CMS 
identifies a lower GDP (PPP) country- 
level price for the GLOBE Model drug 
that would be used beginning with the 
next applicable calendar quarter. We 
note this approach would allow CMS to 
consider international drug pricing 
information that becomes available over 
time, for example, after a per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark is 
identified by CMS for a GLOBE Model 
drug, a new data source may become 
available, a data source may add data for 
additional countries to its offering, data 
for sales for certain countries in the set 
of reference countries might become 
available within an existing data source, 
or international sales pricing and 
volume data may reflect lower prices 
related to market changes in reference 
countries. A lower benchmark could 
result in a lower per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark amount and greater total 
GLOBE Model rebate amount as well as 
lower GLOBE Model beneficiary 
coinsurance. Allowing for a potential 
lower per unit country-level price could 
potentially positively impact model 
beneficiaries’ access to GLOBE Model 
drugs and lower beneficiary financial 
liability. However, doing so would 
increase operational complexity for the 
model and could impact manufacturers’ 
decisions to voluntarily submit 
international drug net pricing data, 
which would interfere with the model 
test of implementing and testing an 
alternative rebate calculation using 
Method II and collecting such data. 
Therefore, to avoid unnecessary 
complexity in the model design and to 
reduce the potential for confounding 
events during the GLOBE Model test 
related to changes to the per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark, 
CMS has opted to not revise the per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark for 
a GLOBE Model drug once it has been 
identified by CMS. 
Similarly, CMS considered 
identifying the lowest country-level 
GDP (PPP) adjusted net price per 
HCPCS billing unit reported by a 
manufacturer as the Method II 
benchmark. This also could result in a 
lower benchmark, lower per unit GLOBE 
Model benchmark amount, and likely 
greater total GLOBE Model rebate 
amount as well as lower GLOBE Model 
beneficiary coinsurance. However, CMS 
is concerned this could also impact 
manufacturers’ decision to voluntarily 
submit international drug net pricing 
data, which could prevent CMS from 
being able to test the alternative rebate 
calculation using Method II. 
We considered not adjusting the 
country-level prices for differences in 
economy size and purchasing power. 
That is, we considered not applying a 
GDP (PPP) adjustment within the 
calculations for the Method I and 
Method II benchmarks, which would 
result in lower benchmarks, and 
applying a GDP (PPP) adjustment to the 
Method II benchmark only, because 
there is some uncertainty in our belief 
that existing international drug pricing 
information closely reflects actual prices 
paid as those data may not include 
lagged price concessions and therefore 
may not closely represent actual prices. 
Using available 2024 international drug 
pricing information, we estimate that 
not applying a GDP (PPP) adjustment 
would result in lower benchmarks and 
greater anticipated model savings and 
beneficiary coinsurance reductions for 
GLOBE Model beneficiaries. Relatedly, 
manufacturers would also be more 
likely to owe total GLOBE Model 
rebates. Our analysis showed that 
including the GDP (PPP) adjustment, 
using illustrative 2024 data, could result 
in up to 28 percent less potential model 
performance year 1 savings, given that 
the reference countries are economically 
comparable to the U.S., we would 
expect that adjusting for country wealth 
differences based on PPP adjusted GDP 
would more likely result in appropriate 
international pricing information that 
align with other country-specific 
dynamics. We also considered that there 
are a range of alternative rebate 
calculations that could be appropriate 
for testing under the GLOBE Model and 
that it may be feasible to test other 
alternative approaches (or calculation 
steps) than the two methods we propose

be identified by using a formula that 
calculates an average ‘‘lowest’’ country- 
level price by calculating an average 
country-level price across the countries 
with the two lowest country-level 
prices. To test a limited model design, 
we have opted to propose a test for two 
alternative rebate calculations that each 
use unique calculations and different 
international drug pricing information 
data sources. Although there could be 
other appropriate alternative 
calculations for a model test, we opted 
to test alternatives that would have 
distinct features related to data sources 
and benchmark calculations to enhance 
the potential to understand the impact 
of each alternative and the overall 
model test. 
In addition, we considered testing an 
alternative rebate calculation using the 
proposed Method I and Method II 
approaches in different subsets of the 
GLOBE Model beneficiary cohort, such 
as creating two separate model 
beneficiary groups using different model 
geographic areas (that is, after selecting 
the model geographic areas, about half 
would be aligned with testing each 
benchmark approach). We opted not to 
pursue this alternative because the 
proposed model test calculations are 
specific to a GLOBE Model drug and 
manufacturer submission of 
international net pricing information 
would be voluntary making separate test 
areas not necessary and potentially 
insufficient. For example, a separate 
population subset for testing each 
benchmark methodology could result in 
weaker incentives for manufacturers to 
voluntarily submit data necessary for 
CMS to test identifying a benchmark 
based on the proposed Method II 
approach. Further, we believe that, if 
the GLOBE Model were to test our 
proposed Method II approach, or any 
alternative rebate calculation, using a 
benchmark based on voluntary 
manufacturer reporting of international 
net pricing information in a distinct 
model beneficiary cohort, a default 
benchmark would still be necessary in 
cases when manufacturer net pricing 
information would not be available. As 
such, we believe our proposed approach 
of testing a Method I benchmark 
alongside a test of a Method II 
benchmark is essential for a feasible 
model design that would test an 
alternative rebate calculation that is 
based on manufacturer submitted net 
pricing information. Therefore, we 
opted to pursue the approach of a single 
model beneficiary cohort for testing 
both alternative rebate calculations. 
We welcome comments on the 
alternative we considered and our 
proposed approach for identifying a per 
unit GLOBE Model benchmark using 
two alternative calculations. 
3. Proposed Methodology for Identifying 
the Per Unit GLOBE Model Benchmark 
Amount for an Applicable Calendar 
Quarter 
In this section of this proposed rule, 
we propose the methodology CMS 
would use to determine the per unit 
GLOBE Model benchmark amount for a 
GLOBE Model drug for an applicable 
calendar quarter. 
In 42 CFR 513.400, we propose that, 
quarterly for each GLOBE Model drug, 
after CMS identifies the per unit Method 
I GLOBE Model benchmark as set forth 
in 42 CFR 513.410, as available, and the 
per unit Method II GLOBE Model 
benchmark as set for the in 42 CFR 513.420, as available, CMS would 
compare the identified per unit Method 
I GLOBE Model benchmark (if available) 
and the identified per unit Method II 
GLOBE Model benchmark (if available) 
to identify which benchmark is greater 
and would be identified as the per unit 
GLOBE Model benchmark for the 
GLOBE Model drug for the applicable 
calendar quarter. In 42 CFR 
513.400(b)(3), we propose that if CMS 
determines that neither of these 
benchmarks is available, CMS would 
determine that the per unit GLOBE 
Model benchmark for the GLOBE Model 
drug for the applicable calendar quarter 
is ‘‘not available’’. 
In addition, we propose that CMS 
would apply an adjustment to the 
identified per unit GLOBE Model benchmark to calculate the per unit GLOBE Model benchmark amount, 
which would include: (1) a modest 
increase to account for potential 
differences between the U.S. market and 
markets in the reference countries that 
may remain after allowing for economic 
and purchasing power differences 
(called the ‘‘applicable threshold 
percentage’’ as set forth in 42 CFR 
513.400 and discussed in section 
II.G.3.a. of this proposed rule); and (2) 
an amount that would equal the dollar 
value of the ‘‘add-on percentage’’ 
included in the Medicare Part B drug 
payment limit for the GLOBE Model 
drug for the applicable calendar quarter 
(as set forth in 42 CFR 513.400 and 
discussed in section II.G.3.b. of this 
proposed rule) which would be called 
the ‘‘add-on percentage amount’’. The 
add-on percentage would be the 
percentage above 100 percent that is 
specified under section 1847A(b)(1)(B) 
of the Act. In general, the Medicare Part 
B payment limit would be equal to the 
‘‘specified amount’’ (as defined at 42 
CFR 427.20). As noted previously, for 
most HCPCS Level II codes, the add-on 
percentage is 6 percent in most cases, 
but it may be 3 percent or 8 percent 
(when ASP is not yet available during 
the initial sales period, for certain 
qualifying biosimilar biological 
products, and in certain circumstances 
specified within section 1847A(d)(3)(C) 
of the Act). 
The per unit GLOBE Model benchmark amount would be used in 
the calculation of the per unit GLOBE 
Model rebate amount for a GLOBE 
Model drug for an applicable calendar 
quarter as discussed in section II.G.4.a. 
of this proposed rule. 
As discussed in section II.G.2. and 
proposed in 42 CFR 513.400(b)(3) of this 
proposed rule, for a GLOBE Model drug 
for an applicable period, if neither a per 
unit Method I GLOBE Model benchmark 
nor a per unit Method II GLOBE Model 
benchmark is available, CMS would identify that the per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark for such GLOBE Model drug for such applicable calendar quarter as 
‘‘not available’’. In such cases, we 
propose that CMS would determine that 
the per unit GLOBE Model benchmark amount was not available for purposes of calculating the per unit GLOBE Model 
rebate amount in proposed 42 CFR 
513.400, as discussed in section II.G.4. 
of this proposed rule. We note that this 
scenario would be possible in cases 
where a GLOBE Model drug is sold in 
the U.S. and international drug pricing 
information for applicable international 
analog for that GLOBE Model drug is 
not available through at least one 
international drug pricing information 
data source, including voluntary 
manufacturer submission of 
international drug net pricing data, and 
in cases where such GLOBE Model drug 
is sold in the U.S. but is not sold in any 
of the reference countries. We also note 
that in such cases (as proposed in 
section II.G.4. of this proposed rule), the 
per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount, 
as proposed in 42 CFR 513.510, would 
be based on the difference between the 
specified amount (as determined under 
42 CFR 427.302(b)) and the inflation- 
adjusted payment amount (as 
determined under 42 CFR 427.302(g)). 
This means that, in cases where CMS 
has not identified a per unit GLOBE 
Model benchmark amount, the per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount would 
equal the per unit rebate amount that 
CMS determines in accordance with the 
Medicare Part BDrug Inflation Rebate 
Program under 42 CFR 427.302, as 
applicable.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260281 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules a. Proposed Applicable Threshold 
Percentage 
In 42 CFR 513.400(c)(1), we propose 
to increase the per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark by an applicable threshold percentage which would allow for a modest increase over the international 
benchmark to account for potential 
differences between the U.S. market and 
markets in the set of reference countries 
for which international drug pricing 
information was available for 
identifying the benchmark. Although 
the proposed calculation for the per unit 
GLOBE Model benchmark includes 
adjustments for economic and 
purchasing power parity differences, 
further adjustment for some potential 
remaining differences by applying a 
minimal threshold adjustment could be 
warranted. 
Because the reference countries for 
which international drug pricing 
information would be available for 
identifying either the Method I or 
Method II benchmark (as described in 
sections II.G.2.a. and II.G.2.b. of this 
proposed rule, respectively) could vary 
by GLOBE Model drug, by applicable 
calendar quarter, and by the alternative 
calculation approach used (that is, 
Method I or Method II), we considered 
whether a consistent or variable 
approach for selecting the applicable 
threshold percentage would be 
appropriate for the model test. We 
considered that there could be many 
factors that could be included in the 
development of a threshold that would 
suit our aim of allowing for a modest 
margin over the identified per unit 
GLOBE Model benchmark that would be 
connected meaningfully to the different 
methods and data sources for an 
alternative rebate calculation that would 
be tested and would not be overly 
complex such that the calculation 
would be as transparent and easily 
implemented as practical. We also 
believe that applying a consistent 
threshold to the benchmarks that were 
identified using the same method and 
data sources is appropriate for the 
model test. That is, we believe that the 
threshold, if adopted for the model test, 
should be determined consistently for 
both methods, but that the magnitude of 
the threshold could be different for 
Method I and Method II to account for 
potential remaining differences for each 
method between the U.S. market and 
markets in the reference countries. We 
believe that this straightforward 
approach would avoid unnecessary 
variation in the model test and would 
increase the learning potential for the 
model. 
Under our proposed approach for 
identifying the per unit Method I GLOBE 
Model benchmark, the benchmark 
would be based on available existing 
international drug pricing information 
data sources that contain prices that 
could represent list prices, ex- 
manufacturer prices (sometimes called 
ex-factory prices) that represent actual 
or calculated prices paid to the 
manufacturer by wholesalers and other 
distributors, retail prices that represent 
actual or calculated sales for retail 
purchasers, and/or prices paid by other 
purchasers in the distribution (as 
discussed in section II.G.1. of this 
proposed rule). Such pricing 
information may not include all 
applicable discounts such that net 
pricing would be lower than the 
identified benchmark particularly after 
the proposed GDP (PPP) adjustment, 
even though we propose to base the 
benchmark on the lowest country-level 
price. Further, existing data sources 
capture drug pricing information that is 
made available from various sources 
and, by its nature, does not likely reflect 
the full range of confidential discounts 
and net pricing. In addition, because 
drug pricing information that is made 
available to existing data sources 
becomes accessible to drug purchasers, 
the variation among such prices for a 
given drug would be expected to lessen 
over time. Thus, we believe a reasonable 
margin necessary for purposes of the 
model test above a benchmark that 
would be based on international drug 
pricing information from existing data 
sources would be minimal, perhaps a de 
minimis amount of up to 2 percent, to 
account for potential differences 
between the U.S. market and markets in 
the reference countries that would not 
be addressed by other proposed aspects 
of the alternative calculation that is 
based on the lowest-country-level price. 
country-level price. 
Under the proposed approach for 
identifying the per unit Method II 
GLOBE Model benchmark, the 
benchmark would be based on 
voluntary manufacturer-submitted 
international drug net pricing 
information which is intended to reflect 
the full range of discounts and net 
pricing. To account for the likelihood of 
larger price variations across countries 
that may occur in actual transaction 
prices abroad, CMS proposes to use a 
higher applicable threshold percentage 
of 5 percent. A lower applicable 
threshold is appropriate for the Method 
I benchmark since it relies on the lowest 
country level prices, which do not 
reflect the full range of discounts and 
net pricing. These variations in the 
applicable threshold percentage 
advance the testing of two alternative 
rebate calculations for the model, one 
that uses aggregate net pricing 
benchmarks while the other uses the 
lowest country level price that lacks net 
pricing information. In 42 CFR 
513.400(d), we propose that, when the 
per unit GLOBE Model benchmark is 
based on the per unit Method I GLOBE 
Model benchmark, the applicable 
threshold percentage would be 102 
percent. When the per unit GLOBE 
Model benchmark is based on the per 
unit Method II GLOBE Model 
benchmark, the applicable threshold percentage would be 105 percent. 
In developing our proposal, we 
considered two options for structuring 
the threshold: (1) apply a fixed 
adjustment (such as a percentage 
amount) for all GLOBE Model drugs 
regardless of the benchmark method; or 
(2) apply a variable adjustment that 
reflects one or more characteristics of 
the GLOBE Model drug, the alternative 
rebate calculations, or reference 
countries. We also considered that no 
adjustment would be necessary. As 
noted above, we opted to prioritize a 
straightforward approach that would be 
connected to the alternative benchmark 
calculation methodologies. 
In developing this proposal, we also 
considered that, although our proposal 
for how CMS would identify the per 
unit GLOBE Model benchmark amount 
would allow a modest threshold above 
the per unit GLOBE Model benchmark to account for potential remaining 
differences between the U.S. market and 
markets in the reference countries, the 
difference between the proposed 
adjustment, which is 102 percent of the 
per unit Method I GLOBE Model 
benchmark (that is, the lowest per unit 
GDP (PPP) adjusted country-level price) 
and the 105 percent of the per unit 
Method II GLOBE Model benchmark, 
might not provide sufficient incentive 
for manufacturers to voluntarily submit 
international drug pricing information 
for testing the Method II alternative 
rebate calculation. Without a sufficient 
incentive, the model test of the Method 
II benchmark could be limited or 
unsuccessfully implemented. 
We welcome comments on our 
proposal for the applicable threshold 
percentage and alternatives that may 
help advance the aims of the model test. 
b. Proposed Add-On Percentage Amount 
In 42 CFR 513.400(c)(2), we propose 
to increase the per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark by the add-on percentage amount (that is, the dollar value of the add-on percentage) that is included in 
the specified amount (as determined under 42 CFR 427.302(b)) when

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260282 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules calculating the per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark amount. Specifically, CMS 
would identify the dollar amount of the 
statutory add-on amount, typically 6 
percent of the Medicare Part B payment 
amount as calculated under section 
1847A(b) of the Act (which is typically 
based on the volume-weighted average 
sales price). For example, if the per unit 
volume-weighted average sales price for 
a drug for an appliable calendar quarter 
is $100 and the 6 percent add-on 
applies, the statutory add-on amount 
per unit would be $6 and CMS would 
add $6 in the calculation of the per unit 
GLOBE Model benchmark amount. This 
proposed approach is intended to avoid 
including an amount equal to the add- 
on within the GLOBE Model rebate 
amounts that manufacturers would owe. 
We note that under the Medicare Part B 
Drug Inflation Rebate Program, when 
the specified amount (as determined 
under 42 CFR 427.302(b)) and the 
inflation-adjusted payment amount (as 
determined under 42 CFR 427.302(g)) 
are compared, each of these amounts 
could include an amount related to an 
add-on percentage. Our proposed 
approach would be consistent with the 
treatment of add-on amounts under the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program. 
We considered an alternative of not 
increasing the per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark to account for an add-on that would be included in the specified 
amount (as determined under 42 CFR 427.302(b)) but we decided to propose 
this increase because we believe that 
increasing the per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark by the dollar value of the add-on included in the specified 
amount (as determined under 42 CFR 427.302(b)) would likely increase the 
rebate amounts manufacturers could 
owe simply due to one part of the rebate 
calculation including an add-on amount 
while the other part in the comparison 
would not. 
We welcome comments on our 
proposed methodology for identifying 
the per unit GLOBE Model benchmark amount and our rationale for this approach. We also welcome comment 
on potential alternative approaches that 
would closely align the per unit GLOBE 
Model benchmark amount with the net 
pricing in various international markets. 
For the per unit Method I GLOBE Model 
benchmark, we also considered the 
possibility of adjusting annually for 
inflation. However, it is not clear how 
best to do that given differences across 
reference countries that exist and 
because each drug may have a different 
reference country that is used to identify 
the per unit Method I GLOBE Model 
benchmark. Therefore, we are soliciting 
comments on this potential policy to 
inflation adjust the default international 
benchmark and the best ways to 
implement this while maintaining the 
goals of the model test. 
4. Proposed Methodology for 
Calculating the GLOBE Model Rebate 
Amount 
In this section of the proposed rule, 
we propose how CMS would calculate 
the per unit GLOBE Model rebate mount and the incremental per unit GLOBE 
Model rebate amount due. We also 
propose a methodology to identify the 
total number of GLOBE Model billing 
units in order to calculate the total GLOBE Model rebate amount and the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount due. Finally, we propose a methodology to reduce the incremental 
GLOBE Model rebate amount for GLOBE 
Model drugs in shortage and when there 
is a severe supply chain disruption. 
a. Proposed Methodology for 
Calculation of the Per Unit GLOBE 
Model Rebate Amount and the 
Incremental Per Unit GLOBE Model 
Rebate Amount 
In this section of this proposed rule, 
we propose how CMS would identify 
the per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount and the incremental per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount for a 
GLOBE Model drug for an applicable 
calendar quarter. The per unit GLOBE 
Model rebate amount would reflect the 
result of the alternative rebate 
calculation and the incremental per unit 
GLOBE Model rebate amount would be 
the amount in excess of the rebate 
amount calculated as set forth in 42 CFR 
427.301. Thus, the incremental per unit 
GLOBE Model rebate amount would be 
an ‘‘incremental amount’’ in addition to 
the Medicare Part B drug inflation 
rebate amount to avoid complex 
operational overlap with the Medicare 
Part B Drug Inflation Rebate Program 
activities and potential confusion for 
GLOBE Model participants. 
To test the program impact of the 
alternative rebate calculation, for a 
GLOBE Model drug for an applicable 
calendar quarter, we propose that the 
per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount 
would be the greater of: (1) the 
difference between the specified amount 
(as determined under 42 CFR 
427.302(b)) and the per unit GLOBE 
Model benchmark amount (as described 
in section II.G.3. of this proposed rule), 
if available; or (2) the difference 
between the specified amount (as 
determined under 42 CFR 427.302(b)) 
and the inflation-adjusted payment 
amount (as determined under 42 CFR 427.302(g)). If the result is an amount 
less than $0, we propose that the per 
unit GLOBE Model rebate amount 
would be set at $0. 
We intend to design the GLOBE 
Model in a manner that ensures 
Medicare FFS beneficiaries who are 
GLOBE Model eligible beneficiaries 
would not face greater financial liability 
when they receive a GLOBE Model drug 
for which Medicare Part B allows 
separate payment and the Medicare 
program would not also pay more in 
such cases. Therefore, we are proposing 
that the per unit GLOBE Model rebate 
amount would not be lower than the difference between the specified amount 
(as determined under 42 CFR 
427.302(b)) and the inflation-adjusted 
payment amount (as determined under 
42 CFR 427.302(g)). That is, our 
proposed approach would ensure that 
the per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount would not be less than the Part B inflation rebate amount, if any, for the 
applicable calendar quarter. 
We are also proposing to calculate an 
incremental per unit GLOBE Model 
rebate amount for a GLOBE Model drug 
for an applicable calendar quarter which 
would represent the amount in excess of 
the per unit Part B rebate amount 
calculated as set forth in 42 CFR 
427.302. We believe that calculating the 
incremental per unit GLOBE Model 
rebate amount for a GLOBE Model drug 
for an applicable calendar quarter is 
necessary for purposes of the GLOBE 
Model test to provide transparency to 
manufacturers with respect to how 
GLOBE Model rebate amounts would be 
invoiced, due, and paid—that is, the 
follow-on model operational activities 
that are inherent components of the 
model test but that, given the proposed 
limited geographic scope of the model, 
must coincide with Medicare Part B 
Drug Inflation Rebate Program 
operational activities for a Part B 
rebatable drug. We believe that 
calculating incremental distinct 
amounts for purposes of GLOBE Model 
follow-on activities would provide 
clarity, reduce potential confusion, and 
facilitate accurate invoices and rebate 
payment for both the GLOBE Model and 
the Medicare Part B Drug Inflation 
Rebate Program as further discussed in 
section II.G.8. of this proposed rule. 
We propose to codify these 
calculations in 42 CFR 513.510, 
including that the results would be 
rounded to the second decimal place. 
We note that in cases where CMS 
determines that the per unit GLOBE 
Model benchmark amount is not 
available, our proposal means that the 
per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount 
for an applicable calendar quarter 
would be the difference between the

This estimate is not based on international net 
pricing information, but it is calculated based on 
the volume-weighted average across countries using 
a GDP (PPP) adjuster as described in this proposed 
rule, IQVIA national audits and IQVIA MIDAS

prices, which may be list price or average invoice

available information; they do not take into account 
rebates or clawbacks, details of which are normally 
confidential, and therefore these estimated prices 
do not reflect net prices realized by the 
manufacturers. Sales values reflected in these 
IQVIA audits are calculated by applying such 
relevant pricing to the product volume data 
collected for, and reflected in, such audits. In 
addition, to allow the national audit sales values to 
be viewed at a common sales level, MIDAS applies 
a single average industry margin to the locally 
reported values. The drug price provided is an 
estimated price and its intended function is to 
convert volumes to sales—this estimated price is

specified amount (as determined under 
42 CFR 427.302(b)) and the inflation- 
adjusted payment amount (as 
determined under 42 CFR 427.302(g)). 
We also note that, in these cases, the 
incremental per unit GLOBE Model 
rebate amount would be zero because 
there would be no amount in excess of 
the per unit Part B rebate amount 
calculated as set forth in 42 CFR 
427.302. 
We welcome comment on our 
proposed methodology for determining 
the per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount and calculating the incremental per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount 
for a GLOBE Model drug for an 
applicable calendar quarter. 
b. Proposal for Identification of the 
Total Number of GLOBE Model Billing 
Units 
In this section of this proposed rule, 
we discuss how the total number of 
GLOBE Model billing units for a GLOBE 
Model drug for an applicable calendar 
quarter would be identified for purpose 
of thereafter being used to calculate the 
total GLOBE Model rebate amount and 
the incremental GLOBE Model rebate amount. 
For purposes of the Medicare Part B 
Drug Inflation Rebate Program, CMS 
identifies the total number of billing 
units as set forth in 42 CFR 427.303. We 
propose, in 42 CFR 513.520, that, to 
identify the total number of GLOBE 
Model billing units, CMS would identify 
the total number of billing units from 
the total number of billing units that 
CMS identified in accordance with 42 
CFR 427.303(b) where, on the date of 
service, the Medicare beneficiary was 
identified by CMS as a GLOBE Model 
eligible beneficiary and for which 
Medicare Part B FFS made separate 
payment. We propose that the resulting 
sum of the identified billing units 
would be identified as the total number 
of GLOBE Model billing units that CMS 
would use to calculate the total GLOBE 
Model rebate amount and the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount for a GLOBE Model drug for an applicable calendar quarter. This 
approach would ensure that units that 
are not included in the total number of 
billing units determined under 42 CFR 
427.303, such as 340B units and units 
of discarded drugs, would also not be 
included in the total number of GLOBE 
Model billing units. 
We note that, because the total 
number of GLOBE Model billing units 
would be determined from the total 
number of billing units that CMS 
identified in accordance with 42 CFR 
427.303(b), the total number of GLOBE 
Model billing units would always be 
equal to or less than the total number of 
billing units identified for the Medicare 
Part B Drug Inflation Rebate Program 
and most likely substantially less given 
our proposal to limit the model scope to 
approximately 25 percent of Medicare 
Part B FFS beneficiaries. We also note 
that this method of identification of the 
total number of GLOBE Model billing 
units prevents any potential discrepancies related to the number of 
billing units used to calculate GLOBE 
Model rebate amounts because the total 
number of billing units as determined 
under 42 CFR 427.303 would be the 
starting point and the GLOBE Model 
Eligible Beneficiary List and Medicare 
claims would clearly facilitate CMS’ 
identification of the subset of those 
billing units where, on the date of 
service, the Medicare beneficiary was 
identified by CMS as a GLOBE Model 
eligible beneficiary and for which 
Medicare Part B FFS made separate 
payment. 
c. Proposal for the Calculation of the 
Total GLOBE Model Rebate Amount and 
Incremental GLOBE Model Rebate 
Amount Due for a GLOBE Model Drug 
for an Applicable Calendar Quarter 
In this section of this proposed rule 
and in 42 CFR 513.500, we propose how 
the total GLOBE Model rebate amount and the incremental GLOBE Model rebate amount for a GLOBE Model drug 
for an applicable calendar quarter 
would be calculated. To clearly identify 
the alternative rebate under the GLOBE 
Model test, CMS would calculate the 
total GLOBE Model rebate amount that 
manufacturers would be accountable 
for. To avoid potential duplication 
across activities under the Medicare Part 
B Drug Inflation Rebate Program, a per 
unit incremental amount would be used 
to identify the incremental GLOBE 
Model rebate amount which 
manufacturers would owe to CMS in 
addition to any amount invoiced under 
the Medicare Part B Drug Inflation 
Rebate Program. Both of these amounts 
would be used for follow-on steps for 
GLOBE Model reporting, invoicing, and 
rebate payment as discussed in section 
II.G.8. of this proposed rule. The 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount would be adjusted prior to these follow-on steps, when applicable, for 
GLOBE Model Drugs in shortage and 
when there is a severe supply chain 
disruption as discussed in section 
II.G.4.d. of this proposed rule. 
We propose that the total GLOBE 
Model rebate amount for a GLOBE 
Model Drug for an applicable calendar 
quarter owed by a manufacturer of the 
GLOBE Model drug to the Federal 
Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust 
Fund would be the amount calculated 
as the product of the per unit GLOBE 
Model rebate amount as calculated 
pursuant to 42 CFR 513.510(a) and the 
total number of GLOBE Model billing 
units (as identified as set forth in 42 CFR 513.520(c)). We note that when the 
per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount is 
zero, the total GLOBE Model rebate 
amount would also be zero. To simplify operations while clearly invoicing 
manufacturers for this amount, we 
propose to calculate an incremental 
GLOBE Model rebate amount that would 
represent the amount of the total GLOBE 
Model rebate amount that is in excess of 
the rebate amount for the Medicare Part 
B Drug Inflation Rebate Program that 
applies to the total number of GLOBE 
Model billing units. 
In 42 CFR 513.500(b), we propose that 
the incremental GLOBE Model rebate amount would be the amount calculated as the product of the incremental per 
unit GLOBE Model rebate amount as set 
forth in 42 CFR 513.510(b) and the total 
number of GLOBE Model billing units 
(as identified as set forth in 42 CFR 
513.520).

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260284 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules is based on international pricing 
information available to CMS following 
the process described in sections II.G.1. 
and II.G.3. of this proposed rule. The 
illustrative per unit Method I GLOBE 
Model benchmark represents the lowest 
per unit GDP (PPP) adjusted country- 
level price. To provide an illustrative 
per unit Method II GLOBE Model 
benchmark, CMS used international 
pricing data available as a proxy for an 
across country volume-weighted average 
GDP (PPP) adjusted net price. For 
example, for Method I the illustrative 
per unit benchmark amount ($16.16) is 
calculated by taking the sum of the 
product of the illustrative per unit 
Method I benchmark and a threshold 
percentage of 102 percent and the dollar 
value of the illustrative add-on 
percentage of the Medicare Part B 
payment limit ($13.378 * (1.02) + 
$2.514). The illustrative per unit GLOBE 
Model rebate amount for Method I is the 
greater of $28.26 or $0.59, where $28.26 
is the difference between the illustrative 
specified amount and the illustrative 
per unit GLOBE Model benchmark 
amount ($44.416¥$16.16) and $0.59 is 
the difference between the illustrative 
specified amount and the estimated per 
unit Inflation-Adjusted rebate amount 
($44.416¥$43.830). The illustrative 
incremental per unit GLOBE Model 
rebate amount is then calculated as the 
difference between the illustrative per 
unit GLOBE Model rebate amount and 
the estimated per unit Part B rebate 
amount ($28.26¥$0.59). We follow a 
similar process to calculate the 
illustrative Method II per unit GLOBE 
Model rebate amount using 105 percent 
as the threshold percentage. CMS 
welcomes comments on this proposal.

d. Proposal for Reducing the 
Incremental GLOBE Model Rebate 
Amount for GLOBE Model Drugs in 
Shortage and When There Is a Severe 
Supply Chain Disruption 
(1) Reducing the Incremental GLOBE 
Model Rebate Amount for GLOBE 
Model Drugs in Shortage 
In accordance with section 
1847A(i)(3)(G)(i) of the Act as codified 
in 42 CFR 427.401, CMS reduces the 
total rebate amount determined under 
42 CFR 427.301(a), if any is owed, for 
a Part B rebatable drug that is currently 
in shortage, as set forth in 42 CFR 
427.400. For purposes of the Medicare 
Part B Drug Inflation Program, to 
calculate the reduction in the total 
rebate amount for a Part B rebatable 
drug that is currently in shortage, CMS 
calculates the number of days such drug 
is described as ‘‘currently in shortage’’ 
on an FDA shortage list in a calendar 
quarter, divides by the number of days 
in the calendar quarter, and then 
multiplies that amount by the 
applicable percentageas specified in 42 
CFR 427.401(b)(2). 
For purposes of the GLOBE Model, 
CMS proposes at 42 CFR 513.500(d) to 
reduce the incremental GLOBE Model 
rebate amount using in the methodology 
specified in 42 CFR 427.401(b)(1). 
Specifically, to closely align with the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program, for any GLOBE Model drug 
currently in shortage during an 
applicable calendar quarter during the 
model performance period, CMS 
proposes to use the applicable percent 
reduction and percentage of time the 
drug was currently in shortage during 
the applicable quarter as set forth in 42 
CFR 427.401(b). In proposed 42 CFR 
513.500(d), CMS would reduce the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount, if any, for such GLOBE Model drug for such applicable calendar 
quarter. The ‘‘applicable percent 
reduction’’ in the formula would be 
determined as set forth in 42 CFR 
427.401(b)(2) as applicable, including to 
account for whether the GLOBE Model 
drug is a plasma-derived product and 
the number of consecutive applicable 
calendar quarters such drug is currently 
in shortage. We note that this approach 
would maintain the meaning and use of 
the terms ‘‘applicable percent 
reduction’’ and ‘‘time drug was 
currently in shortage’’ as those terms are 
used in 42 CFR 427.401(b). Specifically, 
we are proposing that the equation 
would be— 
Reduced incremental GLOBE Model 
rebate amount = the incremental GLOBE 
Model rebate amount multiplied by (1 
minus ‘‘applicable percent reduction’’ determined under 42 CFR 427.401(b)(2) 
multiplied by (‘‘percentage of time drug 
was currently in shortage during the 
applicable calendar quarter’’ as 
determined in accordance with 42 CFR 
427.401(b)(3)) added to the incremental 
GLOBE Model rebate amount multiplied 
by (1 minus ‘‘percentage of time drug was currently in shortage during the 
applicable calendar quarter’’ as 
determined in accordance with 42 CFR 
427.401(b)(3)). 
Further, CMS proposes to apply a 
reduction of the incremental GLOBE 
Model rebate amount as determined 
under 42 CFR 513.510(d)(2) to all the 
NDCs under the relevant billing and 
payment code as specified in 42 CFR 
427.401(c). We codify our proposal in 
proposed 42 CFR 513.500(d). As 
discussed in section II.G.8. of this 
proposed rule, any applied reductions 
would be identified in the GLOBE 
Model Rebate Report. 
As an alternative to our proposed 
approach, we considered whether, for 
purposes of the GLOBE Model, the 
applicable percent reduction should be 
greater than or less than the applicable 
percentage reduction specified in 42 
CFR 427.401(b)(2). To maintain 
consistency with the Medicare Part B 
Drug Inflation Rebate Program and 
avoid creating different manufacturer 
incentives for addressing shortages and 
supply chain disruptions, we decided to 
propose to apply, for purposes of the 
GLOBE Model, the same applicable 
percentage reduction as used under the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program. 
(2) Reducing the Incremental GLOBE 
Model Rebate Amount for a GLOBE 
Model Drug When There Is a Severe 
Supply Chain Disruption 
Under section 1847A(i)(3)(G)(ii) of the 
Act as codified in 42 CFR 427.402, CMS 
reduces the total rebate amount 
determined under 42 CFR 427.301(a), if 
any is owed, for a Part B rebatable 
biosimilar biological product when CMS 
determines there is a severe supply 
chain disruption during the applicable 
calendar quarter such as that caused by 
a natural disaster or other unique or 
unexpected event. Additional 
instructions for submitting rebate 
reduction requests are provided in the 
collection of information that was 
approved on July 22, 2024, under OMB 
control number 0938–1474 and can be 
found on reginfo.gov. As discussed in 
section II.B.1. of this proposed rule, we 
are proposing to exclude biosimilar 
biological products from the definition 
of GLOBE Model drugs. But, if after 
notice and comment that proposal is not 
finalized, we are proposing that, for any 
GLOBE Model drug that is a biosimilar 
biological product as set forth in section 
1847A(c)(6)(H) of the Act, CMS would 
reduce the incremental GLOBE Model 
rebate amount, if any, when there is a 
severe supply chain disruption during 
the applicable calendar quarter in the 
same manner as specified in 42 CFR 
427.402, including the limitation on 
rebate reductions in 42 CFR 
427.402(b)(4). 
Specifically, to the extent that CMS 
finalizes a definition of GLOBE Model 
drugs that were to include biosimilar 
biological products, when CMS reduces 
the total rebate amount determined 
under 42 CFR 427.301(a), if any is owed, 
for a Part B rebatable biosimilar 
biological product that is a GLOBE 
Model drug for an applicable quarter, 
CMS would likewise reduce the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount determined pursuant to 42 CFR 513.500(b), if any is owed, using the 
specifications for calculation of the 
reduced rebate amount set forth in 42 
CFR 427.402(b), substituting ‘‘the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount’’ for ‘‘the total rebate amount’’, 
subject to the eligibility requirements 
set forth in 42 CFR 427.402(c), and to 
apply that rebate reduction only if the 
eligibility criteria in 42 CFR 427.402(c) 
are met. Our intent is to maintain the 
meaning and use of other terms and 
provisions within 42 CFR 427.402. In 
other words, to the extent that 
biosimilar biological products are 
included in the GLOBE Model, CMS 
intends to reduce the incremental 
GLOBE Model rebate amount for such 
GLOBE Model drug, if any is owed, 
when there is a severe supply chain 
disruption using the same criteria and 
percentage reduction that CMS applied 
under 42 CFR 427.402 for such GLOBE 
Model drug for the applicable calendar 
quarter. 
We note that, if our proposal to 
exclude biosimilar biological products 
from the definition of GLOBE Model 
drugs is finalized in a final rule 
establishing the GLOBE Model, our 
proposal for reduction of the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount for GLOBE Model drugs that are 
biosimilar biologicals when there is a 
severe supply chain disruption would 
not be necessary and we would not 
include such provision in such final 
rule.

(3) Other Considerations for Reducing 
the Incremental GLOBE Model Rebate 
Amount for GLOBE Model Drugs in 
Shortage and When There Is a Severe 
Supply Chain Disruption 
Previous ASPE analysis showed that a 
small number (3 percent) of Part B drugs 
and biological products were listed in 
the FDA list of current shortages in 
January 2023.
119
The same study 
showed that most of the products in 
shortage were injectables and products 
that have been approved longer than 11 
years. Using the FDA’s lists of drugs in 
shortage,
120 121
we identified three Part B 
drugs associated with a shortage in 
2024, but none of these drugs was a 
proposed GLOBE Model drug. Prior 
work that examined the extent to which 
changes in U.S. volume and price of 
drugs in shortage affect volume and 
prices of the same drugs in other OECD 
countries concluded there is little 
evidence that U.S. shortages are 
associated with volume and price 
changes in the sample of OECD 
countries examined.
122
Although the 
potential number of GLOBE Model 
drugs associated with a shortage or 
supply chain disruption may be small, 
the impacts of a single shortage may be 
large in terms of costs to patients and 
health care providers when managing a 
shortage as well as negative impacts on 
patient health due to delayed or 
unavailable treatments;
123 124 125
for this 
reason and for consistency with section 
1847A(i)(3)(G)(i) and (ii) of the Act, we 
are proposing to reduce the incremental 
GLOBE Model rebate amount for GLOBE 
Model drugs in shortage and, to the 
extent biosimilar biological products are 
included in the model, when there is a 
severe supply chain disruption as 
discussed in section II.G.4.d.(2). of this 
proposed rule. We also considered not 
reducing the incremental GLOBE Model 
rebate amount or applying a smaller or 
larger reduction than determined under 
42 CFR 427 subpart E. 
We seek comments on our proposal 
for reduction of the incremental GLOBE 
Model rebate amount for GLOBE Model 
drugs in shortage and for GLOBE Model 
drugs that are biosimilar biologicals 
when there is a severe supply chain 
disruption. 
5. Proposed Payment Responsibilities 
As discussed in section II.E. of this 
proposed rule, we propose that model 
participants would be manufacturers of 
GLOBE Model drugs. Consistent with 
the Medicare Part B Drug Inflation 
Rebate Program, under the GLOBE 
Model, we propose that a 
‘‘manufacturer’’ would be identified 
using the same approach used for 
reporting ASP and the Medicaid Drug 
Rebate Program data. The manufacturer 
of a GLOBE Model drug would be 
responsible for all GLOBE Model rebate 
payments for each applicable GLOBE 
Model drug. We propose that 
manufacturers of GLOBE Model drugs 
with a total GLOBE Model rebate 
amount due of $0 or greater would be 
provided a rebate report which would 
serve as an invoice for the total GLOBE 
Model rebate amount due, using an 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount, as described in section II.G.4.c. of this proposed rule. As discussed in 
section II.G.8. of this proposed rule, 
CMS is proposing to include the total 
GLOBE Model rebate amount and 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount in either the Preliminary Rebate Report and Rebate Report provided to 
the manufacturer pursuant to 42 CFR 
513 subpart H (which would be the 
same rebate reports used for the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program) or in separate Preliminary 
GLOBE Model Rebate Report and 
GLOBE Model Rebate Report that CMS 
would provide to the manufacturer. 
When multiple manufacturers are 
linked to a single HCPCS Level II code 
that represents a GLOBE Model drug 
(for example, GLOBE Model drugs that 
have NDCs involving multiple labeler 
codes), we propose to apportion the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount as set forth in paragraph (b) or (c) of 42 CFR 427.301 as applicable. 
That is, a manufacturer’s liability for the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount would be calculated by CMS and would be proportionate to the 
manufacturer’s total billing units sold 
during the applicable calendar quarter. 
This approach adopts CMS’ current 
operational approach for the Medicare 
Part B Drug Inflation Rebate Program 
and is necessary for testing the model in 
an efficient and consistent manner. 
We seek comment on this proposed 
approach for calculating the 
manufacturer payment responsibility for 
total GLOBE Model rebate amounts due, 
if any, for a GLOBE Model drug for an 
applicable calendar quarter. 
6. Proposed Reporting Requirements 
and Process for Voluntary 
Manufacturer-Provided Data 
In order for CMS to identify a per unit 
Method II benchmark in the alternative 
inflation rebate amount calculation for a 
given GLOBE Model drug, a 
manufacturer must voluntarily report 
international pricing data. A 
manufacturer must submit this data in 
accordance with reporting requirements 
and process set forth for voluntary 
manufacturer-provided data. For CMS to 
determine that the submission is an 
‘‘applicable submission’’, we propose in 
42 CFR 513.610(a)(3)(i) that the data 
must include all the basic data elements 
(as set forth in 42 CFR 513.610(b) and 
described in section II.G.6. of this 
proposed rule) required for each 
‘‘applicable international analog’’ as 
defined in 42 CFR 513.600 that 
corresponds to a GLOBE Model drug. 
An applicable international analog 
means a non-U.S. analog whose 
scientific or nonproprietary name, 
dosage form, and route of 
administration (if applicable) align with 
a GLOBE Model drug and that are sold 
in one or more reference countries 
during the applicable ASP calendar 
quarter, excluding those identified in 
their respective country as a generic or 
biosimilar biological product according 
to the country’s own regulations. 
In addition, the submission must 
contain all the net pricing data elements 
(as set forth 42 CFR 513.610(c)) required

As defined at proposed 42 CFR 513.600 ‘‘non- 
U.S. country regulatory approval status’’ means 
information relevant for CMS to determine whether 
each applicable international drug’s regulatory 
approval status (according to the applicable 
reference country’s regulatory framework), is an 
international generic (international non-originator 
drug), international biosimilar biological product 
(international non-originator drug), international 
originator drug, or other. Individual countries differ 
in the regulatory processes and standards governing 
approval of drugs and biologicals. Use of 
international drug pricing information in the 
proposed GLOBE Model should not be interpreted 
to connote FDA approval or to otherwise describe 
any scientific or regulatory relationship between 
U.S.-approved and non-U.S.-approved products. 
manufacturers can select to submit net 
pricing data (as described in section 
II.G.6.b. of this proposed rule). We also 
propose in 42 CFR 513.610 that the 
submission must be complete, meaning 
the submission—(1) has a proper and 
full execution of the manufacturer data 
agreement; (2) has a proper and full 
attestation by the manufacturer’s 
authorized representative; (3) was 
submitted using the proper portal and 
all security requirements within; (4) was 
executed in the manner and form 
required by CMS; and (5) includes 
supporting documentation that explains 
how each of the elements of the 
submission were compiled or calculated 
and any reasonable assumptions that 
were applied. Incomplete submissions, 
as determined by CMS, would not be 
assessed for validity and would not be 
used by CMS for purposes of identifying 
a per unit Method II GLOBE Model 
benchmark. 
In addition, we propose that complete 
data submissions would be assessed by 
CMS for validity. As discussed 
previously in section II.G.1. of this 
proposed rule, to do so, CMS would 
utilize all available existing data sources 
and information to assess the extent to 
which the submission reflects 
international drug net pricing for the 
applicable international analogs that 
were sold in the reference countries 
during the applicable ASP calendar 
quarter. To inform the review, as 
determined by CMS, CMS may use 
available data sources. We propose that 
CMS may choose to request additional 
supporting information and/or data 
from the manufacturer who submitted 
the data to inform CMS’ assessment of 
the validity of the submission. Because 
the amount of time that CMS would 
have to complete the review would be 
minimal (for example, approximately 2 
weeks), CMS would limit the amount of 
time that a manufacturer would have for 
submission of additional supporting 
information to no more than 5 business 
days from the agency’s request for 
additional supporting information or 
data or both. 
a. Basic Data Requirements 
Under the data agreement, 
manufacturers may make submissions 
for one or more GLOBE Model drugs for 
any applicable ASP calendar quarter. If 
a manufacturer chooses to make a 
submission for a GLOBE Model drug to 
enable identification of a per unit 
Method II GLOBE Model Benchmark, 
the manufacturer would include all 
applicable international analogs as 
defined by 42 CFR 513.600. We also 
propose that the basic data element 
requirements would consist of data 
elements, including but not limited to 
presentation level information, that 
manufacturers must submit in order for 
CMS to corroborate that an applicable 
international analog (as defined in 42 
CFR 513.600) which is included in the 
manufacturer submitted data 
corresponds to a GLOBE Model drug 
and to verify the results of the 
manufacturer’s conversion to HCPCS 
billing units. To verify a manufacturer’s 
conversion to HCPCS billing units, CMS 
proposes to calculate the number of 
HCPCS billing units (as defined in 42 
CFR 513.20) in the applicable 
international analog, by dividing the 
quantity of drug in the package by the 
HCPCS dosage (quantity of drug 
represented in one HCPCS billing unit). 
In 42 CFR 513.610, we propose that 
the required basic data elements that 
would be used by CMS to identify the 
international net pricing data that 
corresponds to a GLOBE Model drug, 
would include the GLOBE Model drug 
brand name, nonproprietary name, and 
HCPCS Level II code. We also propose 
that the basic data elements provided by 
the manufacturer contain a list of every 
applicable international analog as 
defined in 42 CFR 513.600 that was sold 
in that reference country for the 
applicable ASP calendar quarter. The 
list is the required basic data elements 
including presentation level 
information. We propose that a 
complete submission must have these 
data elements for all of the applicable 
international analogs as defined in 42 
CFR 513.610 by reference country: 
€Scientific or nonproprietary name. €Brand name, all international drug names. 
€HCPCS Level II code. €Names of manufacturers, marketers, or licensees. 
€Non-U.S. country regulatory approval status
126
(international 
originator drug or international non- 
originator drug). 
€Dosage form and route of administration (if applicable). 
€Strength. €Volume per item (for example, 10 ml in one vial). 
€Package type (for example, syringe, vial, ampule, etc.). 
€Number of items per package (for example, 10 vials in a package). 
€HCPCS dosage (published by CMS each for HCPCS Level II code). 
€Number of HCPCS billing units. We propose that these data elements 
would be required to be submitted for 
all applicable international analogs sold 
in the reference country during the 
applicable ASP calendar quarter that 
corresponds to a GLOBE Model drug. If 
there are missing data elements, the 
submission would be considered 
incomplete and would be deemed 
unacceptable for identifying a per unit 
Method II benchmark until the 
manufacturer provides all the necessary 
data elements to CMS no later than 30 
calendar days after the end of the 
applicable ASP calendar quarter. This 
means that if, for a GLOBE Model drug, 
there are six applicable international 
analogs in a reference country, the 
manufacturer submitted data must 
include the basic data elements for 
every applicable international analog in 
that reference country. If an applicable 
international analog was sold in 
multiple reference countries, then the 
manufacturer submitted data must also 
include the basic data elements for all 
applicable international analogs in each 
of the reference countries. That is, the 
basic data element requirements 
necessitate submitting the data elements 
separately for each applicable 
international analog for each reference 
country. This information would be 
necessary to allow CMS to identify each 
applicable international analog within 
each reference country where the drug 
is sold.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260289 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules Note: This is an illustrative example for structure of the basic data elements for each 
reference country and the applicable 
international analogs. The specific format for 
how manufacturers would submit the data is 
further discussed in section II.G.6.d. of this 
proposed rule. 
We propose that if, for any of the 
basic data elements, third-party 
individuals and organizations were used 
to gather, analyze, or submit the data, 
the manufacturer must specify their use 
of third party data with respect to each 
of the type of activity (gather, analyze, 
or submit the data) engaged in by the 
third party, and the third-party 
individual or organization identified in 
the basic data element submission. 
We recognize the complexities 
inherent in international 
pharmaceutical markets, including 
variations in strengths, formulations, 
and routes of administration; packaging 
differences; and diverse relationships 
between U.S. and international entities 
responsible for product marketing and 
distribution. CMS seeks comments on 
whether the proposed voluntary 
framework, which includes basic 
required data elements to ensure 
applicable international analogs 
correspond with GLOBE Model drugs, 
adequately addresses these market 
complexities. We also seek comments 
on whether additional basic data 
elements should be required or if any of 
the proposed elements presents 
significant data collection, analysis, or 
submission challenges. 
b. Options for Submission of Net Pricing 
Data Elements 
When manufacturers choose to submit 
voluntary international drug net pricing, 
we propose a two-step process: (1) 
submission of basic data elements as 
previously described; and (2) 
submission of international drug net 
pricing data from one of the two options 
proposed in this section. For submission 
of international drug net pricing data, 
we propose manufacturers can choose 
between these 2 options to submit: 
streamlined or limited. In both options, we propose manufacturers would 
provide the required volume-weighted 
average GDP (PPP)-adjusted net pricing 
per HCPCS billing unit for the 
applicable international analogs for all 
reference countries the applicable 
international analogs were sold in for 
the applicable ASP calendar quarter 
(across country volume-weighted 
average GDP (PPP) adjusted net price 
per HCPCS billing unit). The difference 
between the two options is the level of 
aggregation allowed for the submission 
of gross sales, net sales, and sales 
volume that was used by the 
manufacturer to calculate the across 
country volume-weighted average GDP 
(PPP)-adjusted net pricing per HCPCS 
billing unit. In the streamlined option, 
we propose reporting prices for each 
applicable international analog in each 
reference country. In the limited option, 
we propose reporting prices aggregated 
at the reference country level. 
We also propose in 42 CFR 513.610 
that manufacturers who elect to submit 
international drug net pricing data must 
submit all of the net pricing data 
elements required for one of the two 
options described later in section, in 
addition to the basic data elements that 
are discussed in section II.6.a. of this 
proposed rule. The required net pricing 
data elements are further described in 
the next sections and in 42 CFR 
513.610(c)(i) for the streamlined option 
and 42 CFR 513.610(c)(ii) for the limited 
option. Manufacturers would select 
which option to follow but must select 
one option. For each GLOBE Model 
drug, manufacturers must report net 
pricing data elements for all the applicable international analogs that are 
sold in the set of reference countries, as 
described in 42 CFR 513.600, using one 
of the two available options. 
(1) Streamlined Option 
Under the streamlined option, CMS 
proposes that manufacturers would be 
required to report a set of net pricing 
data elements for the applicable 
international analogs that correspond to 
the GLOBE Model drug. For the 
purposes of the streamlined option, we 
propose to define in 42 CFR 513.600 
that ‘‘gross sales’’ refers to each sale the 
manufacturer made in that reference 
country to a purchaser, the amount of 
money owed to a manufacturer by the 
purchasers, before subtracting any 
discounts, rebates, or other price 
concessions. We propose to define 
‘‘purchaser’’ in 42 CFR 513.600 as the 
entities or organizations acquiring the 
drug product for subsequent sale within

administration or dispensing to a 
human. It may include, among others, 
wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, 
pharmacies, and other healthcare 
providers and practitioners. For ‘‘price 
concessions’’, we propose the following 
definition in 42 CFR 513.600 to mean 
the sum of the value of the following 
types of transactions and items whether 
at the time of sale or afterwards: 
€Volume discounts: ‘‘Volume discounts’’ are also known as quantity 
discounts or bulk discounts where the 
price per unit is reduced when 
purchased in larger quantities. 
€Prompt pay discounts: The term ‘‘prompt pay discounts’’, also known as 
early payment discounts, means any 
reduction in the total value of units 
purchased routinely offered to a 
purchaser when a payment is made 
within a specified timeframe and 
consistent with customary business 
practices for payment. 
€Cash discounts: The term ‘‘cash discounts’’ refers to reductions on the 
price per unit when payment is made in 
cash. This may be facilitated through 
discount cards, coupons, or other 
agreements. 
€Free goods includes samples or other benefits provided to purchasers or 
patients that are contingent on any 
purchase requirement. 
€Chargebacks: This term refers to retrospective payments made from 
manufacturers to purchasers. 
€Rebates: This term refers to reimbursements made by a 
manufacturer to a wholesaler or other 
purchaser, for the difference between 
the price the wholesaler or other 
purchaser initially paid for the product 
and the lower price at which the 
wholesaler or other purchaser sold the 
product. 
€Other price concessions that lower the amount realized by the 
manufacturer. 
We also propose to define in 42 CFR 
513.600 that ‘‘net sales amount’’ means 
for each sale the manufacturer made in 
that reference country to a purchaser, 
the amount of money owed by the 
purchaser exclusive of any price 
concessions. Each net sales amount 
would have a corresponding sales 
volume, expressed in HCPCS billing 
units. The net sales amount is not a list 
price (for example., the equivalent of 
WAC in the United States); rather, it is 
based on the net price of the applicable 
international analog sold in each 
reference country. We propose ‘‘net 
price level,’’ defined at 42 CFR 513.600, 
to mean with respect to sales of 
applicable international analogs, means 
all sales of the applicable international 
analogs in a reference country at the 
same price net of price concessions 
during the applicable ASP calendar 
quarter. We also propose the submission 
include the net sales amount in the 
reference country currency, what the 
local currency is (for example, euro, 
yen, etc.), and its equivalent U.S. dollar 
amount, at the net price level. This 
means the data submitted would report 
each sales transaction’s net sales 
amount, at an aggregated net price level, 
along with the corresponding volume 
sold expressed in HCPCS billing units. 
In addition, we propose the gross sales 
amount and net sales amount to be 
rounded to 5 decimal places. 
We recognize that manufacturers may 
not have access to every sale in a 
reference country if they are not the 
ones who are making the sale. Under 
our proposal, we would expect the 
manufacturer to obtain data for every 
transaction that is made directly to 
health care entities, distributors, 
wholesalers, or other international 
purchasers and aggregate those that 
share a price and concession amount 
resulting in sales by the net price level. 
In Table 7 an example of a voluntary 
submission of net pricing data by the 
manufacturer of GLOBE Model drug I is 
shown. This fictitious GLOBE Model 
drug I has more than one applicable 
international analog in 3 reference 
countries, A, B and C. In reference 
country A it has 2 applicable 
international analogs, in reference 
country B it has 4, and in reference 
country C it has 3. For reference country 
A, the applicable international analog 1 
has 5 net price levels, thus an applicable 
submission would include gross and net 
sales amounts and volume sold 
expressed in HCPCS billing units for 
each of the 5 levels. In the same 
reference country A, applicable 
international analog 2 has 3 net price 
levels, thus the acceptable submission 
includes 3 gross and net sales amounts 
with the corresponding volumes. This 
logic is repeated in Table 7 for the other 
reference countries with applicable 
international analogs to GLOBE Model 
drug I. Because the net price level 
represents all sales transactions that 
occurred at the same net price during 
the applicable ASP calendar quarter, 
there may be multiple individual sales 
of each applicable international analog. 
However, all such sales were aggregated 
into a single net price level when they 
share the same net price after applying 
any applicable price concessions.

182.761 60292 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules In addition, under the streamlined 
option, we propose that manufacturers 
provide one ‘‘average net-to-gross ratio’’ 
for each GLOBE Model drug per 
reference country. For the purposes of 
the streamlined option, we propose to 
define the ‘‘average net-to-gross ratio’’ to 
be the total net sales of the applicable 
international analogs in the reference 
country divided by the total gross sales 
of the applicable international analogs 
in the reference country. We also 
propose the average net-to-gross ratio to 
be rounded to 5 decimal places. An 
example of how the average net-to-gross 
ratio would be reported is shown in 
Table 7. In Reference Country A, the 
sum of all net sales amount for all 
applicable international analogs is 
1044.00000 and the sum of all gross sale 
amount for the same set of drugs is 
1900.00000. Thus, the average net-to- 
gross ratio would be all net sales 
amount divided by the sum of all gross 
sales amounts resulting in 0.54947. A 
more detailed calculation is shown later 
in this section. 
In addition, we propose 
manufacturers would be required to 
report for each country, the volume- 
weighted net price across all applicable 
international analogs, in U.S. dollars. 
We also propose to define ‘‘volume- 
weighted net price’’ to mean exclusive 
of any price concessions, the volume- 
weighted reference country average net 
price in U.S. dollars where the weights 
are volumes in HCPCS billing units. In 
addition, we propose volume of the 
applicable international analog in 
HCPCS billing units must be expressed 
using the same number of decimals 
places as the submitted GLOBE Model 
Drug’s HCPCS billing units. The 
volume-weighted net price per reference 
country must also be rounded to 5 
decimal places. 
Using again the example of reference 
country A shown in Table 7, each of the 
net price sales amounts for both 
applicable international analogs 
contribute to the volume-weighted net 
price according to how much volume 
was sold. The net sales amounts are 
converted from local currency to U.S. 
dollars using an exchange rate that is 
described by 3 decimal places and 
expressed as number of local currency 
units to U.S. dollars. In other words, net 
sales amounts are converted to U.S. 
dollars by dividing the net sales by the 
exchange rate. Our proposal for 
exchange rate considerations is 
discussed in section II.G.6.c. of this 
proposed rule. For this example, each 
net sale is divided by 0.800. This results 
in an average price for one HCPCS 
billing unit of GLOBE Model Drug I in 
reference country A being $187.00231. 
A more detailed calculation is shown 
later in this section. 
We also propose that manufacturers 
would be required to submit, across all 
the reference countries, the across 
country volume-weighted average GDP 
(PPP) adjusted net price per HCPCS 
billing unit, which is the volume- 
weighted average GDP (PPP)-adjusted 
net price of all the applicable 
international analogs corresponding to a 
GLOBE Model drug in U.S. dollars along 
with the GDP (PPP) adjuster that was 
used for the adjustment. We propose to 
define at 42 CFR 513.20, the across 
country volume-weighted average GDP 
(PPP) adjusted net price per HCPCS 
billing unit to mean a volume-weighted 
average for all reference countries of 
GDP (PPP)-adjusted net prices, where 
the weights are the volume in HCPCS 
billing units for each reference country, 
in U.S dollars from international drug 
net pricing data from an applicable 
submission. In addition, we propose the 
across volume-weighted average GDP 
(PPP)-adjusted net price per HCPCS 
billing unit to be reported and rounded 
to 3 decimal places. 
We propose that the GDP-adjustment 
would be based on PPP and that 
manufacturers must use the GDP (PPP)- 
adjuster from CMS that aligns with the 
applicable ASP calendar quarter as 
specified by CMS. CMS would publish 
a supplemental document on the 
GLOBE Model website with details on 
which GDP (PPP) adjuster would be 
used for each applicable ASP calendar 
quarter. To establish the GDP (PPP) 
adjuster for each ASP calendar quarter, 
we propose to use the most recent data 
of GDP per capita based on purchasing 
power parity for a country (GDP (PPP)) 
available in the CIA World Factbook at 
the start of the applicable ASP calendar 
quarter (as defined in 42 CFR 513.20) as 
determined by CMS. CMS would 
publish this GDP (PPP) adjuster at the 
beginning of each applicable calendar 
quarter. 
An example of the across country 
volume-weighted average GDP (PPP) 
adjusted net price per HCPCS billing 
unit for all reference countries can also 
be observed in Table 7. In this example 
for GLOBE Model Drug I, there is only 
one across country volume-weighted 
average GDP (PPP) adjusted net price 
per HCPCS billing unit for all three 
reference countries. Each net sales 
amount for all applicable international 
analogs in the three reference countries 
contribute to this average according to 
the volume sold. Each of the 29 net sales 
amounts are converted to U.S. dollars 
using the appropriate exchange rate 
(0.800 for the 8 net sales amounts for 
reference country A, 10.000 for the 14 
net sales amounts for reference country 
B, and 0.860 for the 7 net sales amounts 
for reference country C) and adjusted by 
the reference country’s GDP (PPP) 
adjuster (1.000 for reference country A, 
1.300 for reference country B, and 1.500 
for reference country C). In this 
illustrative example for GLOBE Model 
drug I, the across country volume- 
weighted average GDP (PPP) adjusted 
net price per HCPCS billing unit in all 
reference countries where it is sold is 
$182.761, having accounted for how 
much quantity is sold, the country’s 
currency, and its PPP. 
As a summary, after manufacturers 
have identified applicable international 
analogs as defined in 42 CFR 513.600, 
for an applicable ASP calendar quarter, 
we propose manufacturers use the 
following steps to identify average net- 
to-gross ratio, volume-weighted net 
price per reference country, and across 
country volume-weighted average net 
GDP (PPP) adjusted net price per 
HCPCS billing unit for all reference 
countries for each GLOBE Model drug: 
Step 1: By reference country, apply 
the following data checks. Identify and 
discard data as follows: 
a. Exclude sales for international 
biosimilar biological products and 
international generic products. In other 
words, sales data must be based on 
international originator drugs. 
b. Exclude international drug pricing 
data without both sales and volume data 
that are greater than zero. 
Step 2: By reference country, convert 
the volume data to unit of measurement 
delineated in the GLOBE Model drug’s 
HCPCS Level II code descriptor (for 
example, mg, ml, mcg, etc.), as 
applicable, for each applicable 
international analog and net price level. 
Volume must be expressed using the 
same rounding convention as the 
corresponding GLOBE Model Drug. We 
propose to calculate the number of 
HCPCS billing units in the applicable 
international analog as defined in 42 
CFR 513.610 by dividing the quantity of 
drug in the package by the HCPCS 
dosage (quantity of drug represented in 
one HCPCS billing unit, which is the 
identifiable quantity of a drug or 
biological product associated with a 
billing and payment code (for example, 
a HCPCS Level II code), as established 
by CMS). 
Step 3: By reference country, 
aggregate gross sales amount, in local 
currency, for each applicable 
international analog that has the same 
net price level for each reference 
country. Gross sales amount must be 
rounded to 5 decimal places. Report 
what the local currency is.

Difference?, Investopedia (Apr. 18, 2025), Available 
at https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/ 011315/what-difference-between-gaap-and-ifrs.asp 
(Last accessed Nov. 4, 2025). 
Step 4: By reference country, 
aggregate net sales amount, in local 
currency, for each applicable 
international analog for the 
corresponding GLOBE Model drug that 
have the same net price level for each 
reference country. Net sales amount 
must be rounded to 5 decimal places. 
Report what the local currency is. 
Step 5: By reference country, calculate 
the average net-to-gross ratio, in local 
currency, for each reference country. 
Report what the local currency is. 
a. Sum the gross sales amount for all 
net price levels of all applicable 
international analogs. 
b. Sum the net sales amount for all net 
price levels for all applicable 
international analogs. 
c. Divide the sum determined in Step 
5b. by the sum determined in Step 5a., 
resulting in the average net-to-gross- 
ratio per reference country. The average 
net-to-gross-ratio must be rounded to 5 
decimal places. 
Step 6: By reference country, convert 
the net sales amount, in local currency, 
to U.S. dollars. Divide the net sales, in 
local currency, by, the exchange rate to 
convert to U.S. dollars and round to 5 
decimal places. 
Step 7: By reference country, calculate 
the per unit volume-weighted net 
price— 
a. Multiply the net sales, in U.S. 
dollars, by the volume in HCPCS billing 
unit for each applicable international 
analog and net price level. 
b. Add together the sums determined 
in Step 7a. 
c. Sum together the volume sold in 
HCPCS billing units for all applicable 
international analogs and all net price 
levels. 
d. Divide the sum determined in Step 
7b by the sum determined in Step 7c, 
resulting in the average volume- 
weighted net price per HCPCS billing 
unit per reference country. Round the 
average volume-weighted net price per 
reference country to 5 decimal places. 
Step 8: Calculate the across country 
volume-weighted average GDP (PPP) 
adjusted net price per HCPCS billing 
unit for all applicable international 
analogs to a GLOBE Model drug for all 
reference countries. 
a. Per reference country, multiply the 
average volume-weighted net price 
calculated in Step 7d by the applicable 
GDP (PPP) adjuster per applicable ASP 
calendar quarter (to be published by 
CMS in a supplemental document). 
b. Per reference country, multiply the 
sum in Step 8a by the sum in Step 7c. 
(total volume sold in HCPCS billing unit 
for all applicable international analogs 
and all net price levels). 
c. Sum together the amounts in Step 
8b and divide by the total billing units 
for all applicable international analogs 
in all reference countries, resulting in 
the across country average volume- 
weighted GDP (PPP) adjusted net price 
per HCPCS billing unit for all applicable 
international analogs to a GLOBE Model 
drug across all reference countries. 
Round the across country volume- 
weighted average GDP (PPP) adjusted 
net price per HCPCS billing unit to 3 
decimal places. 
We propose that manufacturers 
submit information on how the data 
elements were compiled and computed 
and consistent with ASP reporting, any 
reasonable assumptions that were made 
during this process. We also propose 
manufacturers provide any other 
pertinent information that CMS should 
consider in its verification process for 
the data. Examples of information to 
submit include if a third party was used 
to gather, analyze, or submit the net 
pricing data element, or if the 
manufacturer made any reasonable 
assumptions to determine the average 
gross-to-net ratio (for example, expected 
clawbacks and other price concessions 
based on past historical data that may 
have delayed reporting to the 
manufacturer and would not be 
available to the manufacturer in time to 
be included in the manufacturer’s data 
submission to CMS no later than 30 
days after the end of the applicable ASP 
calendar quarter). We seek comments on 
reasonable assumptions manufacturers 
may make during their reporting of 
average gross-to-net ratio and net sales 
such as how they account for clawbacks 
and other price concessions that may 
have delayed reporting to the 
manufacturer. 
We also recognize that manufacturers 
may need to allocate gross and net sales 
amounts to the applicable international 
analogs in order to provide the data 
elements required. We propose in 42 
CFR 513.610 that any allocation and 
calculations be done in a manner 
consistent with the generally acceptable 
accounting principles (GAAP), 
international financial reporting 
standards (IFRS), or other 
internationally recognized accounting 
approaches.
127
We solicit feedback on 
whether there are other accounting 
approaches that CMS should consider. 
(2) Limited Option 
Under the limited option, we propose 
that manufacturers would be required to 
submit a set of data elements that are 
aggregated at higher levels than CMS is 
proposing under the streamlined option. 
For all the applicable international 
analogs to a corresponding GLOBE 
Model drug, as defined in 42 CFR 
513.600, and for each reference country, 
we propose that manufacturers submit 
the total gross sales amount in local currency and its equivalent U.S. dollar 
amount, which would be computed as 
the sum of all gross sales amounts for 
the applicable international analogs in 
the reference country’s currency, the 
total net sales amount in local currency and its equivalent U.S. dollar amount, 
which would be computed as the sum 
of all net sales amounts for the 
applicable international analogs in the 
reference country’s currency, and the 
corresponding total sales volume in HCPCS billing units. In other words, the 
total gross sales, total net sales, and total 
sales volume by reference country is an 
aggregate of all the applicable 
international analogs and net price 
levels. For the purposes of the limited 
option, we propose to use the same 
definition as the streamlined option for 
‘‘gross sales amount’’ and ‘‘net sales 
amount’’ as defined in 42 CFR 513.600. 
Manufacturers must also report what the 
local currency is (for example, euro, 
yen, etc.) We also propose the total gross 
sales and total net sales to be rounded 
to 5 decimal places and that the total 
sales volume must be expressed using 
the same number of decimals places as 
the corresponding GLOBE Model Drug’s 
HCPCS billing units. 
We recognize that manufacturers may 
not have access to every sale in a 
reference country if they are not the 
ones who are making the sale. Under 
our proposal, we would expect the 
manufacturer to obtain every transaction 
that is made directly to health care 
entities, distributors, wholesalers, or 
other international purchasers. In 
addition, we propose to require 
manufacturers to submit the average 
net-to-gross ratio for each of the 
reference countries where the applicable 
international analogs were sold for a 
GLOBE Model drug. We propose to 
define the ‘‘average net-to-gross ratio’’ 
for the limited option to be the same as 
the streamlined option which is the 
total net sales of the applicable 
international analogs in the reference 
country divided by the total gross sales 
of the applicable international analogs 
in the reference country. We propose 
manufacturers round the average net-to- 
gross ratio to 5 decimal places. 
We also propose manufacturers to 
report, for each country, the volume- 
weighted net price across all applicable 
international analogs corresponding to a

CFR 513.600, in U.S. dollars. To convert 
from local currency to U.S. Dollars, the 
net sales amount, in local currency, is 
divided by an exchange rate with 3 
decimal places expressed as number of 
local currency units to U.S. dollars. Our 
proposal for exchange rate 
considerations is discussed in section 
II.G.6.c. of this proposed rule. For the 
limited option, we also propose to 
define the ‘‘volume-weighted net price’’ 
the same as the streamlined option, 
which is the volume-weighted reference 
country average net price in U.S. dollars 
where the weights are volume in HCPCS 
billing units exclusive of any price 
concessions as defined in 42 CFR 
513.600. The volume-weighted net price 
per reference country must be rounded 
to 5 decimal places. 
In addition, we propose that 
manufacturers would be required to 
submit, across all the reference 
countries, the across country volume- 
weighted average GDP (PPP) adjusted 
net price per HCPCS billing unit of all 
the applicable international analogs to a 
corresponding GLOBE Model drug, as 
defined in 42 CFR 513.600, in U.S. 
dollars along with the GDP (PPP) 
adjuster that was used for the 
adjustment. The limited option would 
use the same definition as the 
streamlined option for the across 
country volume-weighted average GDP 
(PPP) adjusted net price per HCPCS 
billing unit as defined in 42 CFR 
513.610. This across country volume- 
weighted average GDP (PPP) adjusted 
net price per HCPCS billing unit for all 
reference countries must be rounded to 
3 decimal places. 
We propose that the GDP adjustment 
would be based on PPP and that 
manufacturers must use the GDP (PPP) 
adjuster from CMS that aligns with the 
applicable ASP calendar quarter. CMS 
would publish a supplemental 
document on the GLOBE Model website 
with details on which GDP (PPP) 
adjuster to use for each applicable ASP 
calendar quarter. To establish the GDP 
(PPP) adjuster for each ASP calendar 
quarter, we propose to use the most 
recent data of GDP per capita based on 
purchasing power parity for a country 
(GDP (PPP)) available in the CIA World 
Factbook at the start of the applicable 
ASP calendar quarter (as defined in 42 
CFR 513.20) as determined by CMS. We 
would publish this GDP (PPP) adjuster 
at the beginning of each applicable 
calendar quarter. 
The across country volume-weighted 
average GDP (PPP) adjusted net price 
per HCPCS billing unit would represent 
the average net price per HCPCS billing 
unit of the applicable international 
analogs corresponding to a GLOBE 
Model drug, as defined in 42 CFR 
513.600, across all reference countries 
where the applicable international 
analogs are sold and would include an 
adjustment using GDP (PPP). To 
calculate the across country volume- 
weighted average GDP (PPP) adjusted 
net price per HCPCS billing unit in all 
reference countries where applicable 
international analogs are sold, the 
volume-weighted net price per reference 
country (in U.S. dollars) is multiplied 
by the GDP (PPP) adjuster per reference 
country and then the weighted mean for 
all reference countries is calculated 
using the sum of volume in HCPCS 
billing units for each reference country 
as the weights. 
Table 8 shows the net pricing data 
elements that would be required for 
GLOBE Model Drug I for the limited 
option. In this option, while there may 
be multiple applicable international 
analogs to GLOBE Model Drug I and 
multiple net pricing levels, only total 
gross sales, total net sales, total volume, 
average net-to-gross-ratio, volume- 
weighted net price in U.S. dollars per 
reference country, and across country 
volume-weighted average GDP (PPP) 
adjusted net price per HCPCS billing 
unit in U.S. dollars is reported. 
As a summary, after manufacturers 
have identified applicable international 
analogs sold that correspond to a 
GLOBE Model drug for an applicable 
ASP calendar quarter, we propose 
manufacturers use the following steps to 
identify average net-to-gross ratio, 
volume-weighted net price per reference 
country, and across country volume- 
weighted average GDP (PPP) adjusted 
net price per HCPCS billing unit for all 
reference countries for each GLOBE

descriptor, as applicable, for all 
applicable international analogs. Total 
volume must be expressed using the 
same rounding convention as the 
corresponding GLOBE Model Drug. We 
propose to calculate the number of 
HCPCS billing units in the applicable 
international analog as defined in 42 
CFR 513.610 by dividing the quantity of 
drug in the package by the HCPCS 
dosage (quantity of drug represented in 
one HCPCS billing unit, which is the 
identifiable quantity of a drug or 
biological product associated with a 
billing and payment code (for example, 
a HCPCS Level II code), as established 
by CMS). 
Step 3: By reference country, 
aggregate gross sales amount, in local 
currency, for all applicable international 
analogs. Gross sales amount must be 
rounded to 5 decimal places. Report 
what the local currency is. 
Step 4: By reference country, 
aggregate net sales amount, in local 
currency, for all applicable international 
analogs. Net sales amount must be 
rounded to 5 decimal places. Report 
what the local currency is. 
Step 5: By reference country, calculate 
the average net to gross ratio, in local 
currency, for each reference country: 
a. Sum the gross sales amount for all 
net price levels of all applicable 
international analogs. 
b. Sum the net sales amount for all net 
price levels for all applicable 
international analogs. 
c. Divide the sum determined in Step 
5b by the sum determined in Step 5a, 
resulting in the average net-to-gross- 
ratio per reference country. Round the 
average net-to-gross-ratio to 5 decimal 
places. 
Step 6: By reference country, convert 
the net sales amount, in local currency, 
to U.S. dollars. Divide the net sales, in 
local currency, by, the exchange rate to 
convert to U.S. dollars and round to 5 
decimal places. 
Step 7: By reference country, calculate 
the per unit volume-weighted net price. 
a. Multiply the net sales, in U.S. 
dollars, by the volume in HCPCS billing 
unit for each applicable international 
analog. 
b. Add together the sums determined 
in Step 7a. 
c. Sum together the volume sold in 
HCPCS billing units for all applicable 
international analogs. 
€Divide the sum determined in Step 7b by the sum determined in Step 7c, 
resulting in the average volume- 
weighted net price per HCPCS billing 
unit per reference country and round to 
5 decimal places. 
Step 8: Calculate the across country 
volume-weighted average GDP (PPP) 
adjusted net price per HCPCS billing 
unit for all applicable international 
analogs to a GLOBE Model drug across 
all reference countries. 
a. Per reference country, multiply the 
average volume-weighted net price 
calculated in Step 7d by the applicable 
GDP (PPP) adjuster per applicable ASP 
calendar quarter (to be published by 
CMS in supplemental document). 
b. Per reference country, multiply the 
sum in Step 8a by the sum in Step 7c 
(total volume sold in HCPCS billing unit 
for all applicable international analogs). 
c. Sum together the amounts in Step 
8b and divide by the total billing units 
for all applicable international analogs 
in all reference countries, resulting in 
the across country average volume- 
weighted GDP (PPP) adjusted net price 
per HCPCS billing unit for all applicable 
international analogs to a GLOBE Model 
drug across all reference countries. 
Round the across country average 
volume-weighted GDP (PPP) adjusted 
net price per HCPCS billing unit for all 
reference countries to 3 decimal places. 
c. Exchange Rate Considerations 
For both options for submitting net 
pricing data elements, we are proposing 
that certain data elements would be 
submitted in U.S. dollars and the 
manufacturer would report the 
exchange rate for the currency 
conversion rounded to 3 decimal places, 
which CMS proposes would mean the 
conversion rate used by the 
manufacturer to convert from the 
currency of each reference country to 
U.S. dollars for data included in the 
submission. We propose manufacturers 
use either the World Bank Atlas (for a 
conversion method in lieu of a straight 
exchange rate),
128
IMF exchange rates 
data,
129
the Federal Reserve Bank 
foreign exchange rates,
130
or exchange 
rates from country-specific sources to 
identify the average exchange rate. If the 
data source chosen uses an exchange 
rate frequency that is less than annual 
(for example, daily, weekly, monthly, 
quarterly), the exchange rate for the 
currency conversion would correspond 
to an average exchange rate of the 
chosen frequency for the applicable ASP 
calendar quarter during which 
international sales occurred. We also 
propose manufacturers use the same 
exchange rate for currency conversion 
for all applicable international analogs, 
as defined in 42 CFR 513.600, in a 
reference country. In other words, all 
net pricing data in a reference country 
must use the same exchange rate. We 
also propose that once an exchange rate 
data source is identified that the 
manufacturer continues to use the same 
data source for all subsequent data 
submissions, unless the data source is 
no longer available, and that the 
exchange rate data source is reported 
with each voluntary submission. This 
approach is necessary so that a 
manufacturer’s submitted international 
net pricing data per GLOBE Model drug 
is in a consistent format and CMS 
would be able to combine the data 
appropriately for purposes of testing an 
alternative rebate calculation 
methodology. We solicit feedback on 
other data sources manufacturers would 
consider for currency conversion; the 
methods that would be used; the 
challenges that might arise; and any 
other pertinent information related to 
this topic. 
d. Attestation and Submission 
While manufacturer reporting is 
voluntary, submitted data must meet 
completeness, and validity standards in 
proposed 42 CFR 513.610 and must be 
determined by CMS to be an applicable 
submission in order to be used by CMS 
to identify the per unit Method II 
GLOBE benchmark for a GLOBE Model 
drug for an applicable calendar quarter, 
as discussed in section II.G.2.b. of this 
proposed rule. In 42 CFR 513.610, we 
propose that if the manufacturer is 
electing to submit international drug net 
pricing data, the data must be submitted 
within 30 days after the end of the 
applicable ASP calendar quarter and the 
data that is contained within the 
submission must correspond to the 
applicable ASP calendar quarter. As 
such, we propose that an authorized 
representative, on behalf the 
manufacturer, provide an attestation 
that the submissions are accurate and 
complete to the manufacturer’s 
knowledge, prepared in compliance 
with the requirements specified under 
§ 513.610 (including, but not limited to 
the requirements for basic data elements 
and streamlined or limited option), and 
that the authorized representative has 
the authority to make such attestation 
on behalf of the manufacturer.

information and attest as such. We 
propose the authorized representatives 
must be legally authorized to bind the 
manufacturer to the terms and 
conditions contained within the data 
agreement. The authorized 
representatives are also designated by a 
manufacturer to submit data, manage all 
related communications, and attest to 
the completeness and accuracy of the 
submission on the manufacturer’s 
behalf. We propose that authorized 
representatives must specify if they are 
a third-party organization that is 
submitting data on behalf of the 
manufacturer. We propose that a data 
submission would not be considered 
complete if it does not include all 
requirements of attestation such as 
contact information of the authorized 
representative, whether a third-party 
organization is submitting on behalf of 
the manufacturer, and the attestation 
itself. The submission would also be 
considered incomplete if the required 
basic data elements defined in 42 CFR 
513.610 and the required net pricing 
data elements in the selected 
streamlined or limited option, as 
defined in 42 CFR 513.600, are missing, 
or if the basic data elements and net 
pricing data elements do not correspond 
to the applicable ASP calendar quarter 
that is submitted. 
In 42 CFR 513.610, we propose that 
the attestation and data submission 
process would occur through a CMS 
designated system. We intend to 
designate the CMS Health Plan and 
Management System (HPMS), which is 
currently used for Manufacturer 
Discount Program reporting, reporting 
for the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation 
Program, and for the Medicare Part B 
Drug Inflation Rebate Program. 
Leveraging existing technology and 
systems would facilitate executing the 
GLOBE Model data agreements and 
attestations, submitting data templates 
for the various data submission 
pathways, and provide a method for 
protecting submitted information. While 
we intend to designate HPMS, we may 
designate a different CMS system for 
submission, if necessary. 
We propose that, pursuant to an 
effectuated GLOBE Model data 
agreement, CMS would not disclose 
manufacturer-submitted international 
net pricing information in a form which 
discloses the identity of a specific 
manufacturer and their international net 
pricing and sales data except as CMS 
determines to be necessary to carry out 
42 CFR 513.210 and 42 CFR 513.500 
regarding the determination and 
implementation of the GLOBE Model 
rebate amount, the GLOBE Model 
beneficiary coinsurance, and adjusted 
Medicare payment amount. 
We also propose a manufacturer 
selects one submission option for net 
pricing data elements, either limited or 
streamlined, for all applicable 
international analogs to a GLOBE Model 
drug. That is, for all applicable 
international analogs to a GLOBE Model 
drug for an applicable ASP calendar 
quarter, the manufacturer could not use 
one submission option for net pricing 
data elements for some of the reference 
countries and a different submission 
option for net pricing data elements for 
other reference countries for which 
international net pricing and sales data 
is submitted. Similarly, the 
manufacturer would continue to use the 
same submission option for net pricing 
data elements (either streamlined or 
limited) to submit all their international 
net pricing data for that GLOBE Model 
drug for subsequent applicable ASP 
calendar quarters. That is, once the 
manufacturer chooses to voluntarily 
submit international net pricing data, 
the manufacturer must continue to do so 
for the duration of the GLOBE Model so 
long as sales of applicable international 
analogs have occurred. This approach is 
necessary so that a manufacturer’s 
submitted international net pricing data 
per GLOBE Model drug is in a 
consistent format and that CMS would 
be able to combine the data 
appropriately for purposes of testing an 
alternative rebate calculation 
methodology. We also propose that CMS 
reserves the right to terminate the data 
agreement if a manufacturer chooses to 
stop submitting voluntary international 
net pricing even when sales of the 
applicable international analogs have 
occurred. If the data agreement has been 
terminated, we propose the per unit 
Method I international benchmark is 
used for the GLOBE Model drug for the 
remainder of the model duration. 
e. Corrections and Resubmissions 
We recognize errors may occur during 
a manufacturer’s submission of 
international pricing data and are 
proposing to allow corrections of a 
submission within 30 days of the 
submission deadline. For example, if a 
manufacturer submits international net 
pricing data for the applicable ASP 
calendar quarter ending December 31, 
2026, to CMS no later than January 30, 
2027, in accordance with the 
requirements for submission of such 
data, the manufacturer would be 
allowed to correct the submitted data by 
submitting a full replacement data 
submission and attestation for that 
applicable ASP calendar quarter to CMS 
(in accordance with the requirements 
for submitting corrected data) no later 
than March 1, 2027. We propose to limit 
the timeframe for submission of 
corrected international net pricing data 
to CMS for an applicable ASP calendar 
quarter to 30 days after the deadline for 
the initial submission to potentially 
allow CMS to revise the GLOBE Model 
beneficiary coinsurance percentage for 
applicable GLOBE Model drugs prior to 
the start of the applicable quarter. CMS 
must complete the calculation of the 
GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance 
percentage approximately 30 days prior 
to the start of an applicable quarter. 
Therefore, allowing 30 days for 
manufacturers to submit corrected 
international net pricing data to CMS is 
the maximum amount of time that could 
be permitted for such correction and 
also allow CMS a small window of time 
to recalculate the GLOBE Model 
beneficiary coinsurance percentage and 
make the results available within the 
Medicare Part B claims processing 
systems timely. 
f. Alternatives Considered 
We considered offering a more 
comprehensive option for 
manufacturers. Under this option, in 
addition to the data elements noted in 
the streamlined and limited options, 
manufacturers would have been 
required to submit more granular 
information and a greater number of 
data elements. Specifically, in addition 
to submitting net sales amount at the net 
price level, manufacturers would be 
required to submit the corresponding 
amount of any discounts, rebates, or 
other price concessions for each net 
sales amount at the net price level. As 
part of the submission, manufacturers 
would also submit an across country 
volume-weighted average GDP (PPP) 
adjusted net price per HCPCS billing 
unit in U.S. dollars across all the 
applicable international analogs 
corresponding to the GLOBE Model 
drug and across all the reference 
countries where the applicable 
international analogs are sold. However, 
we decided not to offer this option due 
to concerns of manufacturer and CMS 
reporting burden. 
We also considered offering an option 
that allows manufacturers to submit for 
the entire set of applicable international 
analogs that correspond to a GLOBE 
Model drug, the total gross revenue, 
total net revenue, and total volume for 
each reference country. Under this 
potential option, manufacturers could 
combine the gross revenue, net revenue, 
and volume across all the applicable 
international analogs and report this to 
CMS along with other necessary data 
elements (volume weighted average net

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260297 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules price by reference country and across 
country volume weighted average GDP 
(PPP) adjusted net price). However, we 
decided against including this option in 
the proposal because our ability to 
verify this information would be 
limited. We also considered whether 
manufacturers would be required to 
calculate the volume weighted-average 
net price for each reference country and 
the across country volume-weighted 
GDP (PPP) adjusted net price per 
HCPCS billing unit or whether CMS 
would calculate these values. We 
decided against the policy of CMS 
calculating values because we believe 
that the burden related to doing the 
calculations given the other data 
elements that are required is minimal. 
In addition, we considered whether to 
require the manufacturer to also identify 
the lowest net price among the set of 
reference countries for the set of 
applicable international analogs that 
correspond to a GLOBE Model drug. 
However, as this information is already 
part of the submission, we did not 
believe it was necessary. We seek 
feedback on these policies. 
In addition, we considered providing 
manufacturers the set of applicable 
international analogs for which they 
must submit the international net 
pricing data. However, we believe that 
manufacturers have this information, 
and it would not be burdensome to 
them to identify the set of applicable 
international analogs that are sold in the 
reference countries. We also considered 
the possibility of accepting a submission 
without the full set of applicable 
international analogs included in the 
submission and using the data that is 
submitted along with existing 
information to calculate an updated 
benchmark. However, we decided 
against this approach because of 
concerns about combining different data 
sources and whether it would be logical 
to do so. We also considered allowing 
manufacturers to submit an explanation 
for why they cannot provide pricing 
information for the full set of applicable 
international analogs for all reference 
countries where they are sold and for 
CMS to review the explanation to 
determine if this meets the requirement 
of an applicable submission. However, 
we believe manufacturers have access to 
pricing information for where their 
drugs or biological products are sold 
and can make a reasonable assumption 
of their net to gross ratio. We seek 
feedback on our proposed policy as well 
as the alternatives presented, including 
whether CMS should provide the set of 
applicable international analogs for 
which data would be submitted for each 
corresponding GLOBE Model drug. 
We recognize the complexities 
inherent in international 
pharmaceutical markets, including 
variations in strengths, forms, and 
routes of administration; packaging 
differences; and diverse relationships 
between U.S. and international entities 
responsible for product marketing and 
distribution. For these reasons, we also 
considered only requesting this data for 
the set of applicable international 
analogs that correspond to a GLOBE 
Model drug that are sold directly by the 
manufacturer and not by any other 
subsidiary or company in the reference 
countries. We also considered an option 
where manufacturers would only 
submit the data for the set of applicable 
international analogs that they directly 
sell in the reference countries. However, 
we believe that manufacturers have 
relationships with subsidiaries, 
wholesalers, and other businesses 
involved in selling the set of applicable 
international analogs in the reference 
countries and can obtain the requested 
data under this option. We were also 
concerned that allowing manufacturers 
to only submit for applicable 
international analogs sold directly by 
the manufacturer would potentially 
result in manufacturers choosing which 
applicable international analogs to sale 
directly and which ones to be sold by 
other entities to reduce the 
manufacturer’s GLOBE Model rebate 
liability. We balanced multiple policy 
priorities, including administrative 
burden for manufacturers and CMS; the 
need for complete and verifiable data 
submissions; and potential concerns 
that may arise from disclosing detailed 
international drug pricing information. 
CMS welcomes feedback on our 
proposed policy, the alternatives 
presented, and situations in which 
manufacturers may find it challenging 
to report the proposed net pricing 
information to CMS. 
We also considered two alternatives 
for exchange rate for currency 
conversion. In the first option 
considered, CMS would not specify 
which exchange rate data source to use, 
allowing manufacturers maximum 
flexibility. In the second option, we 
considered publishing the exchange rate 
for currency conversion on the GLOBE 
Model website that would align to the 
applicable ASP calendar quarter, which 
would provide the most data 
standardization. We considered these 
alternatives and believed allowing 
maximum flexibility would lead to 
significant data standardization issues 
that may pose a challenge in testing an 
alternative rebate calculation 
methodology. We also believed that 
while the second option would provide 
for maximum data standardization it 
would limit manufacturer’s ability to 
determine the most appropriate 
exchange rate and data source for when 
the sale of the applicable international 
analog occurred. As such, we believe 
our approach of allowing manufacturers 
to choose within a set of exchange rate 
data sources but requiring 
manufacturers to use the same data 
source within a reference country and 
for subsequent submission of the drugs, 
balances the need for flexibility and 
data standardization. 
In addition, we also considered 
alternatives such as a longer timeline, 
90 days after the end of the applicable 
ASP calendar quarter, for initial 
submission of international drug net 
pricing data as manufacturers may need 
additional time for reconciliation of 
pricing data after the end of the 
applicable ASP calendar quarter. We 
understand that manufacturers’ 
processes and timelines for data 
gathering, calculations and reporting 
may vary widely by manufacturer, 
applicable international analog, 
reference country, and distribution 
arrangements. CMS balanced the timing 
needed to calculate the GLOBE Model 
beneficiary coinsurance percentage and 
manufacturers’ process and timelines 
for data gathering and we believe that 
manufacturers would be able to make 
reasonable assumptions of nets sales 
based on historical data. Therefore, we 
believe requiring initial data submission 
to occur within 30 days after the end of 
the applicable ASP calendar quarter 
provides sufficient time for 
manufacturers to assess any reasonable 
assumptions needed for net sales 
reporting. 
We also considered allowing 
manufacturers up to one year after 
initial data submission to correct data 
and account for any delayed price 
concessions such as clawbacks. As such, 
CMS would invoice manufacturers for 
any additional rebates identified after 
this corrected data submission, but 
would be unable to update the GLOBE 
Model beneficiary coinsurance 
percentage without reprocessing paid 
claims to apply retrospective changes to 
the coinsurance percentage which 
would be administratively burdensome 
for GLOBE Model beneficiaries, 
healthcare providers that submitted 
claims for GLOBE Model drugs that 
were furnished to GLOBE Model 
beneficiaries, CMS, and supplemental 
insurers, as well as confusing for 
impacted beneficiaries which could 
increase beneficiary requests for 
assistance through 1–800–Medicare and 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:53 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\23DEP2.SGM 23DEP2

A non-participating supplier can bill the 
beneficiary for an extra 15 percent beyond the 20 
percent coinsurance. 
from their healthcare providers. We 
considered this alternative and decided 
that since manufacturers are only 
required to report average net-to-gross 
price ratios and because most 
manufacturers likely have an estimate of 
expected clawbacks and other price 
concessions with data lag from 
historical data, manufacturers could 
make a reasonable assumption on their 
average net-to-gross ratio. We seek 
comments on whether the proposed 
timeline provides sufficient timing for 
manufacturers to submit pricing data 
(for example, clawbacks or other types 
of price concessions), whether 
manufacturers have sufficient 
information to make a reasonable 
assumption on their average net-to-gross 
ratio within the reported timelines 
proposed for attestation, and if there are 
other types of reasonable assumptions 
manufacturers may make to meet the 
proposed submission requirements. 
7. Proposed GLOBE Model Beneficiary 
Coinsurance Adjustment and Adjusted 
Medicare Payment for GLOBE Model 
Drugs 
As part of the GLOBE Model design, 
in 42 CFR 513.210, CMS proposes to test 
an alternative calculation for beneficiary 
coinsurance for GLOBE Model eligible 
beneficiaries who receive a GLOBE 
Model drug for which separate Medicare 
Part B payment is allowed. In general, 
for a separately payable Part B drug, the 
basic allowable charges that a 
participating provider or supplier may 
charge the beneficiary are the Part B 
annual deductible and 20 percent of the 
Medicare allowed amount in excess of 
that deductible, subject to the limitation 
described in 42 CFR 419.41(c)(4)(1) 
when applicable (that is, in certain 
circumstances, such as under the OPPS, 
beneficiary coinsurance does not exceed 
the inpatient deductible amount).
131
In 
the case of a Part B rebatable drug, the 
basic allowable charges that a 
participating provider or supplier may 
charge the beneficiary are the Part B 
annual deductible and 20 percent of the 
inflation-adjusted payment amount for 
the rebatable drug in excess of that 
deductible, which is applied as a 
percent to the payment amount for such 
calendar quarter, as set forth in 42 CFR 
489.30(b)(6). 
For the GLOBE Model, we propose to 
calculate the GLOBE Model beneficiary 
coinsurance adjustment for GLOBE 
Model drugs with respect to an 
applicable calendar quarter using a 
methodology that is similar to the 
coinsurance adjustment under the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program as set forth in 42 CFR 427.201. 
Specifically, we propose that, for a 
GLOBE Model drug for an applicable 
calendar quarter, to determine if the 
GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance 
adjustment applies, CMS would 
compare the payment amount, as set 
forth in 42 CFR 427.201(b)(3) (that is, 
CMS would use the published payment 
amount in quarterly pricing files 
published by CMS as the payment 
amount in this determination), to the per unit GLOBE Model benchmark 
amount as set forth in proposed 42 CFR 513.400. If the payment amount exceeds 
the per unit GLOBE Model benchmark amount, the GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance adjustment would apply 
and the GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance would be calculated by multiplying the per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark amount by 0.20. To apply 
this amount as a percent to the payment 
amount for an applicable calendar quarter, we propose that CMS would 
then calculate the GLOBE Model 
beneficiary coinsurance percentage by 
dividing the result by the payment 
amount and rounding the result to the third decimal place. 
If the payment amount does not 
exceed the per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark amount, we propose that the 
GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance 
adjustment would not apply. In such 
cases, the GLOBE Model beneficiary 
coinsurance would be calculated using 
the non-model coinsurance to ensure 
that beneficiary liability for a GLOBE 
Model beneficiary is not greater than it 
would be absent the model. We note 
that, in such cases, the non-model 
coinsurance would likely equal the 
usual coinsurance (that is, 20 percent of 
the Medicare Part B allowed amount, 
assuming no other beneficiary liability 
would apply, as set forth in 42 CFR 
489.30(b)(1)) because such cases would 
occur when neither the GLOBE Model 
beneficiary coinsurance nor a 
coinsurance reduction under the 
Medicare Part B Drug Rebate Program 
would apply. 
CMS would determine and apply the 
GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance 
percentage to the payment amount when processing a claim for a separately 
payable GLOBE Model drug that was 
furnished to a GLOBE Model eligible 
beneficiary on a date of service within 
the applicable calendar quarter. CMS’ 
calculation and application of the 
GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance 
percentage would not be subject to appeal. 
Using the illustrative data for Method 
I presented in Table 6, the illustrative 
payment amount of $44.42 exceeds the 
illustrative per unit GLOBE Model benchmark amount of $16.16). In this 
case, the illustrative GLOBE Model 
beneficiary coinsurance would be $3.23, 
calculated by multiplying the per unit 
GLOBE Model benchmark amount by 
0.20. The illustrative GLOBE Model 
beneficiary coinsurance percentage 
would then be 7.2 percent, which is the 
result of dividing $3.23 by the 
illustrative payment amount of $44.42. Using illustrative 2024 data, 
calculations for the Method I benchmark 
estimated that for 73 percent of the 
illustrative GLOBE Model drugs, the 
beneficiary coinsurance would be 
reduced between 10 and 20 percent. 
Further, our analysis showed that for 17 
percent of the illustrative GLOBE Model 
drugs, the beneficiary coinsurance 
would be reduced between 0 and 10 
percent. For the remaining 10 percent of 
illustrative GLOBE Model drugs, there 
would not have been a change in the 
coinsurance as a result of being in the 
model. 
In conjunction with testing an 
alternative calculation for beneficiary 
coinsurance, we propose that CMS 
would adjust the Medicare payment to 
the provider or supplier for a separately 
payable GLOBE Model drug claim in the 
same manner as under the Medicare 
Part B Drug Inflation Rebate Program as 
set forth in 42 CFR 410.152(m) and, for 
hospital outpatient department services, 
42 CFR 419.41(e). That is, when the 
GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance 
adjustment applies, we propose that the 
Medicare payment amount (the adjusted 
Medicare payment amount) would be 
equal to the allowed amount for the 
GLOBE Model drug minus the product 
of the GLOBE Model beneficiary 
coinsurance percentage and the allowed 
amount, assuming no other claim 
adjustment applies. For example, if the 
Medicare Part B allowed amount under 
the GLOBE Model is $100 and the 
GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance 
percentage is 10 percent (instead of the 
usual 20 percent), the Medicare Part B 
program payment to the provider or 
supplier would be adjusted and would 
be $90 (instead of the usual $80) and the 
beneficiary financial responsibility 
would be $10. The formula in this 
example is $100¥(0.100 × $100) = $90. We note that claims for any Part B 
rebatable drug that is excluded from the 
GLOBE Model for an applicable 
calendar quarter or is not separately 
payable would not be subject to the 
GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance 
percentage and payment adjustment. 
We welcome comments on this 
proposed approach for testing an 
alternative calculation for beneficiary

are furnished to GLOBE Model eligible 
beneficiaries during an applicable 
calendar quarter during the model 
performance period. 
8. Proposed Approach for GLOBE Model 
Rebates Reports, Invoicing, and 
Reconciliation 
In this section of this proposed rule 
and in proposed 42 CFR 513 subpart H, 
we present two alternative approaches 
for how CMS would invoice 
manufacturers for GLOBE Model 
rebates. After considering future 
comment on this proposed rule, CMS 
intends to adopt one of these 
approaches, or a similar approach that 
emerges from CMS’ consideration of 
comments and further analysis of the 
alternatives and establish corresponding 
regulatory text. Hence, although this 
proposed rule includes two options for 
proposed invoicing processes in subpart 
H, CMS has only described one option 
within the regulatory text and only 
intends to include one option in a final 
rule that would establish the GLOBE 
Model. 
One option we considered is called 
the ‘‘combined’’ approach. Under a 
combined approach, using the waiver authority under section 1115A of the 
Act, CMS would delay Medicare Part B 
Drug Inflation Rebate Program 
Preliminary Rebate Reports for all 
manufacturers by up to 2 months and 
would provide a combined report to all 
manufacturers of Part B rebatable drugs 
for both the Medicare Part B Drug 
Inflation Rebate Program and the 
GLOBE Model. The combined report 
would show, in one report, the 
information included in a Medicare Part 
B Drug Inflation Rebate Program Rebate 
Report as specified in 42 CFR 427.501 
and further discussed in section II.G.8.a. 
of this proposed rule. Because there 
would be a single combined report and 
rebate amount due, we propose that the 
Suggestion of Error process specified in 
42 CFR 427.503 would be used such 
that manufacturers would use one 
submission if the manufacturer believes 
that there is a mathematical error or 
errors to be corrected before the Rebate 
Report or a subsequent reconciliation of 
the rebate amount due for both the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program and the GLOBE Model (if any), 
is finalized. We note that, as discussed 
in section II.G.4. of this proposed rule, 
the total GLOBE Model rebate amount invoiced would be an incremental 
amount (the incremental GLOBE Model 
rebate amount), which represents the 
amount of the GLOBE Model rebate that 
is in excess of the rebate amount for the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program that applies to the total number 
of GLOBE Model billing units. 
The combined approach would 
present information in a single report 
which may enhance transparency for 
manufacturers of GLOBE Model drugs. 
In a single report, GLOBE Model Rebate 
Report information would not appear in 
Rebate Reports for Part B rebatable 
drugs that are not GLOBE Model drugs. 
For CMS, the increased operational 
complexity of combining data from the 
Inflation Rebate Program and the 
GLOBE Model into a single report 
would lengthen the time necessary for 
creating Preliminary Rebate Reports for 
all manufacturers of Part B rebatable 
drugs, which, correspondingly, would 
extend the time following the end of an 
applicable calendar quarter for 
manufacturers to pay rebates. 
Another option we considered is 
called the ‘‘incremental’’ approach. 
Under the incremental approach, GLOBE Model reports and invoicing 
would not disrupt the Medicare Part B 
Drug Inflation Rebate Program reports 
and invoicing timelines. This approach 
would use a separate report and 
invoicing process that would run 
approximately two months after the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program reports and would invoice 
manufacturers of GLOBE Model drugs 
for the incremental GLOBE Model 
rebate amount due as set forth in 42 CFR 
513.500(b). Under this two-stage 
process, the Medicare Part B Drug 
Inflation Rebate Program reports would 
show information specified for that 
program and the GLOBE Model reports 
would show information specific to the 
model as proposed in 42 CFR 513.710 
and further discussed in section II.G.8.b. 
of this proposed rule. In 42 CFR 
513.710(b), we propose that a GLOBE 
Model Preliminary Rebate Report would 
be provided to each manufacturer of a 
GLOBE Model drug at least 1 month 
prior to the issuance of the GLOBE 
Model Rebate Report which would be 
provided no later than 8 months after 
the end of each applicable calendar 
quarter. 
Consistent with our proposed timing 
of invoicing activities described later in 
this section, the GLOBE Model 
Preliminary Rebate Report would reflect 
any revisions identified through the 
Suggestion of Error process specified in 
42 CFR 427.503 related to the Medicare 
Part B Drug Inflation Rebate Program 
Rebate Report, and the GLOBE Model 
Rebate Report (or subsequent GLOBE 
Model report) would reflect such 
revisions as applicable. In addition, 
because there would be separate reports, 
in 42 CFR 513.720, we propose a 
separate Suggestion of Error process 
such that a manufacturer would submit 
its Suggestion of Error within 10 
calendar days from the date of receipt of 
a GLOBE Model Preliminary Rebate 
Report (or a report detailing the 
preliminary reconciliation of a GLOBE 
Model rebate amount) for the applicable 
calendar quarter, using a method and 
process established by CMS, if the 
manufacturer believes that there is a 
mathematical error or errors to be 
corrected before the GLOBE Model 
Rebate Report or a subsequent 
reconciliation of the GLOBE Model 
rebate amount, as applicable, is 
finalized. 
The incremental approach using a 
two-step reporting and invoicing 
process and separate Suggestion of Error 
process could facilitate administrative 
efficiencies for CMS and manufacturers 
of GLOBE Model drugs compared to the 
combined approach. Separate reports 
could avoid potential confusion for 
manufacturers of Part B rebatable drugs 
that are not GLOBE Model drugs. 
Under each approach CMS would 
need to calculate the incremental per 
unit GLOBE Model rebate amount for an 
applicable calendar quarter after the 
Part B rebate amount has been 
calculated as set forth in 42 CFR 
427.301, CMS would need additional 
time following the end of an applicable 
calendar quarter for providing 
incremental GLOBE Model Rebate 
Reports to manufacturers of GLOBE 
Model drugs and, similarly, for 
manufacturers to pay rebates. We 
estimate that the extended time would 
be about the same under either the 
combined or incremental approach, and 
the amount of additional time that 
would be necessary would be about two 
months. 
At 42 CFR 513.700, we propose, that 
‘‘date of receipt’’ would have the same 
meaning as set forth in 42 CFR 513.500. 
This term would be applicable to both 
options discussed in this section of this 
proposed rule. 
We welcome feedback on these 
proposed approaches for reports and 
reconciliation and potential refinements 
to them as well as potential alternative 
approaches that would support efficient 
testing and evaluation of the GLOBE 
Model and transparency for 
manufacturers while minimizing 
adverse impacts on manufacturers of 
Part B rebatable drugs and CMS’ 
systems, operations, and financial 
resources. 
The following sections describe the 
proposed reports under the combined 
and incremental approaches in more 
detail.

Report and Reconciliation Under the 
Combined Approach 
Under a combined approach for rebate 
invoicing, to operate the GLOBE Model 
in a streamlined efficient manner, we 
propose that the total GLOBE Model 
rebate amount due would be invoiced to 
the manufacturer using the Medicare 
Part B Drug Inflation Rebate Program 
rebate report processes with some minor 
changes to convey GLOBE Model 
information within one Preliminary 
Rebate Report (and subsequent reports) 
for an applicable calendar quarter and 
allow CMS more time to make reports 
available to manufacturers. 
Specifically, we propose to waive 42 
CFR 427.501(c) to the extent necessary 
such that CMS would provide each 
manufacturer of a Part B rebatable drug 
a Rebate Report that is the invoice for 
the total rebate amount due under both 
the Medicare Part B Drug Inflation 
Rebate Program and the GLOBE Model 
(if applicable), if any, no later than 8 
months after the end of each applicable 
calendar quarter instead of 6 months 
after the end of each applicable calendar 
quarter. The extended timeline would 
apply to all Part B rebatable drugs and 
manufacturers not just those that are 
GLOBE Model drugs and GLOBE Model 
participants. We do not believe that it 
would be feasible to extend the 
timeframe solely for GLOBE Model 
drugs and GLOBE Model participants 
because CMS confirms the identification 
of GLOBE Model drugs and the 
manufacturer(s) of such drugs as CMS 
completes the steps to compile all 
Rebate Reports and the additional 
GLOBE Model considerations would 
increase the level of effort and time 
necessary for CMS to complete all rebate 
calculations and report generation steps. 
In addition, we propose to waive 42 
CFR 427.501 to the extent necessary to 
include GLOBE Model rebate 
information within the Rebate Report 
(and subsequent reports). We propose 
that, for a calendar quarter, a 
Preliminary Rebate Report (and 
subsequent related rebate reports) 
would include the information set forth 
in 42 CFR 427.501(b)(1) as well as 
GLOBE Model information specified in 
new 42 CFR 427.520(b)(2), which we 
propose would include but not be 
limited to the following: the NDC(s) 
billing and payment codes identified for 
the GLOBE Model drug as determined 
by CMS; the total number of GLOBE 
Model billing units as set forth in 42 
CFR 513.520; the total number of billing 
units as determined under 42 CFR 
427.303; the per unit Method I GLOBE 
Model benchmark (as described in 
section II.G.2.a. of this proposed rule 
and identified under 42 CFR 513.410); 
the per unit Method II GLOBE Model 
benchmark, if available (as described in 
section II.G.2.b. of this proposed rule 
and identified under 42 CFR 513.420); 
the per unit GLOBE Model benchmark 
amount as set forth in 42 CFR 513.400; 
the per unit GLOBE Model rebate 
amount as set forth in 42 CFR 
513.510(a); the incremental per unit 
GLOBE Model rebate amount as set 
forth in 42 CFR 513.510(b); the 
applicable calendar quarter specified 
amount as determined under 42 CFR 
427.302(b); the amount, if any, by which 
the specified amount as determined 
under 42 CFR 427.302(b) exceeds the 
inflation-adjusted payment amount as 
determined under 42 CFR 427.302(g) for 
the Part B rebatable drug for the 
applicable calendar quarter as set forth 
in 42 CFR 427.302; the total GLOBE 
Model rebate amount as set forth in 42 
CFR 513.500; the incremental GLOBE 
Model rebate amount due as set forth in 
42 CFR 513.500; any applied reductions 
as determined under 42 CFR 513 
subpart F; the proportion of 
manufacturer-reported ASP units, if 
applicable; and the reduced incremental 
GLOBE Model rebate amount, if any. 
The total rebate amount due would be 
the combined rebate amount due under 
both the GLOBE Model and the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program. The GLOBE Model 
information specified at proposed 42 
CFR 513.710(b)(1) would only be 
populated in Preliminary Rebate 
Reports (and subsequent related rebate 
reports) for manufacturers of GLOBE 
Model drugs. For a Rebate Report for a 
manufacturer of a Part B rebatable drug 
that is not GLOBE Model drug for an 
applicable calendar quarter, the total 
rebate amount due would equal the 
amount specified in 42 CFR 
427.501(b)(1)(ix) which is the rebate 
amount due as determined under the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program at 43 CFR 427.301(a). 
We note that, while we propose to 
issue the Preliminary Rebate Reports 2 
month later, under the combined 
invoicing approach, the cadence for 
rebate reports and reconciliation under 
42 CFR 427.501(b) and (d) would be 
unchanged. For example, preliminary 
rebate reports would be issued 1 month 
before Rebate Reports. Similarly, 
payment of rebate amounts owed would 
be due no later than 11:59 p.m. Pacific 
Time (PT) on the 30th calendar day after 
the date of receipt of information 
regarding the total rebate amount. To 
specify how this cadence would apply 
to Rebate Reports, invoicing, and 
reconciliation, we propose several 
amendments to 42 CFR 427.501(b)(2), 
(c) and (d). Specifically, we propose that 
42 CFR 427.501(c) would waive to the 
extent necessary that CMS would 
provide each manufacturer of a Part B 
rebatable drug no later than 8 months 
after the end of each applicable calendar 
quarter a GLOBE Model Rebate Report 
with the total GLOBE Model rebate 
amount due for a GLOBE Model drug for 
that applicable calendar quarter. We 
propose that 42 CFR 427.501(d)(1) 
would be applied such that CMS would 
perform one regular reconciliation of the 
rebate amount within 12 months of the 
date of receipt of the Rebate Report for 
each applicable calendar quarter. As 
discussed in section II.O. of this 
proposed rule, under the combined 
approach, we propose to use the waiver 
authority under section 1115A of the 
Act, to the extent necessary to delay 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program invoicing for manufacturers of 
GLOBE Model drugs by up to 2 months. 
We propose the GLOBE Model 
information would be added to the 
Preliminary Rebate Reports, Rebate 
Reports, and Reconciliation Rebate 
Reports for an applicable calendar 
quarter under 42 CFR 427 subpart F. 
Because the Suggestion of Error process 
specified in 42 CFR 427.503 would 
apply to the GLOBE Model rebate 
information included in the Preliminary 
Rebate Report or Preliminary 
Reconciliation Rebate Report, 
manufacturers would use one 
submission if the manufacturer believes 
that there is a mathematical error or 
errors to be corrected before the Rebate 
Report or a subsequent Reconciliation 
Rebate Report, as applicable, is 
finalized, and as such we are not 
proposing a separate Suggestion of Error 
process for the GLOBE Model 
information under the combined 
approach. 
If the combined approach is adopted 
for the GLOBE Model, CMS would 
inform manufacturers of the revised 
Rebate Report format by posting 
information on the CMS website and 
issuing a memorandum to all 
manufacturers of Part B rebatable drugs. 
b. Proposed Changes to the Rebate 
Report and Reconciliation Under the 
Incremental Approach 
Under the incremental approach, the 
GLOBE Model rebate amount would be 
invoiced to the manufacturer using a 
process that would be separate from, but 
harmonized with, the Medicare Part B 
Drug Inflation Rebate Program rebate 
invoicing process. As such, in 42 CFR 
513.710 and 42 CFR 513.720, we 
propose regulatory text for GLOBE

with the Medicare Part B Drug Inflation 
Rebate Program as set forth at 42 CFR 
427 subpart F. The Medicare Part B 
Drug Inflation Rebate Program reporting 
and reconciliation would continue as 
specified under 42 CFR 427 subpart F. 
In 42 CFR 513.710(c), for the GLOBE 
Model rebate reporting activities, we 
propose that CMS would provide each 
manufacturer of a GLOBE Model drug a 
GLOBE Model Rebate Report no later 
than 8 months after the end of each 
applicable calendar quarter. For a 
calendar quarter, the GLOBE Model 
Preliminary Rebate Report would 
include the information set forth in 42 
CFR 513.710(b)(1), including the 
following: the NDC(s) billing and 
payment codes identified for the GLOBE 
Model drug as determined by CMS; the 
total number of GLOBE Model billing 
units as set forth in 42 CFR 513.520; the 
per unit Method I GLOBE Model 
benchmark as identified under 42 CFR

CFR 513.510; the incremental per unit 
GLOBE Model rebate amount as set 
forth in 42 CFR 513.510; the applicable 
calendar quarter specified amount as 
determined under 42 CFR 427.302(b), 
the amount, if any, by which the 
specified amount as determined under 
42 CFR 427.302(b) exceeds the inflation- 
adjusted payment amount as 
determined under 42 CFR 427.302(g) for 
the Part B rebatable drug for the 
applicable calendar quarter as set forth 
in 42 CFR 427.302; the amount, if any, 
by which the specified amount as 
determined under 42 CFR 427.302(b) 
exceeds the per unit GLOBE Model 
rebate amount as determined under 42 
CFR 513.510 for the GLOBE Model drug 
for the applicable calendar quarter as set 
forth in 42 CFR 513.500; the total 
GLOBE Model rebate amount as set 
forth in 42 CFR 513.500; the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount as set forth in 42 CFR 513.500; 
the proportion of manufacturer-reported 
ASP units, if applicable; any applied 
reductions as determined under 42 CFR 
513 subpart F; and the reduced 
incremental GLOBE model rebate 
amount, if applicable. 
In 42 CFR 513.710, we propose that 
the incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount would be invoiced to the 
manufacturer using a process that 
would be harmonized with, but separate 
from, the Medicare Part B Drug Inflation 
Rebate Program rebate invoicing 
process. First, in accordance with 42 
CFR 427.501(c), CMS would provide 
each manufacturer of a Part B rebatable 
drug a Rebate Report that is the invoice 
for the rebate amount due for a Part B 
rebatable drug under the Medicare Part 
B Drug Inflation Rebate Program (if any) 
no later than 6 months after the end of 
each applicable calendar quarter. For an 
applicable calendar quarter, the Rebate 
Report includes the information set 
forth in 42 CFR 427.501(b)(1), including 
the total number of billing units as 
determined under 42 CFR 427.303 and 
the rebate amount due as determined 
under 42 CFR 427.301(a), if any. 
Second, via an additional invoice that is 
specific to the GLOBE Model for an 
applicable calendar quarter, we propose 
that CMS would provide each 
manufacturer of a GLOBE Model drug a 
GLOBE Model Rebate Report that would 
be the invoice for the incremental 
GLOBE Model rebate amount (if any) 
which, when considered with the rebate 
amount already invoiced under the 
Rebate Report for the Medicare Part B 
Drug Inflation Rebate Program, 
reconciles the rebate amount due under 
the GLOBE Model to the total GLOBE 
Model amount. The incremental amount 
due (and invoiced on the GLOBE Model 
Rebate Report) would be calculated by 
multiplying the incremental per unit 
rebate amount by the total number of 
GLOBE Model billing units as proposed 
under 42 CFR 513.520. The amount that 
would be reflected in the second GLOBE 
Model-specific incremental invoice for a GLOBE Model drug for a manufacturer 
would be the additional amount owed 
within 30 days of receipt of the GLOBE 
Model rebate report. The GLOBE Model 
also adopts the reconciliation approach 
under the Medicare Part B Drug 
Inflation Rebate Program specified at 42 
CFR 427.501(d). That is, within 12 
months of the issuance of the GLOBE 
Model Rebate Report, a report of the 
reconciled incremental GLOBE Model 
rebate amount will be provided to each 
manufacturer of a GLOBE Model drug to 
account for certain updates (for 
example, updates to the GLOBE Model 
billing units or restatement of inputs to 
the specified amount under 42 CFR 
427.302(b)) that may affect the GLOBE 
Model rebate amount calculation. One 
month prior to the issuance of this 
report with the reconciled incremental 
GLOBE Model rebate amount, CMS will 
conduct a preliminary reconciliation of 
the incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount as set forth in proposed 42 CFR 
5137.710(d). CMS would provide the 
GLOBE Model report to manufacturers 
of GLOBE Model drugs 2 months after 
the Medicare Part B Drug Inflation 
Rebate Program provides a report for the 
applicable calendar quarter. Under the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program, for an applicable calendar 
quarter, there are four reports. Table 9 
shows the four reports for an applicable 
calendar quarter, the timing for each 
report, and an example of how the 
timing for these reports would occur for 
the first applicable calendar quarter 
during performance year 1 of the 
GLOBE Model assuming the proposed 
model start on October 1, 2026.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260302 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules We propose that GLOBE Model rebate 
invoicing would occur after invoicing 
under the Medicare Part B Drug 
Inflation Rebate Program to create a 
unified framework for testing the 
GLOBE Model while maintaining 
harmonization between the model and 
non-model activities. We believe that up 
to 2 months would be a reasonable 
timeframe during which CMS would 
gather the necessary information to 
calculate the incremental GLOBE Model 
rebate amount due and perform data 
quality checks prior to providing each 
manufacturer of a GLOBE Model drug a 
GLOBE Model Rebate Report that would 
be the invoice for the incremental 
GLOBE Model rebate amount due (if 
any). We are proposing to harmonize the 
model and non-model activities, 
including the proposed incremental 
GLOBE Model invoicing approach, to 
maintain consistency and transparency 
for manufacturers with respect to the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program while minimizing 
administrative impacts on 
manufacturers and complexity for CMS 
operations of the Medicare Part B Drug 
Inflation Rebate Program during the 
GLOBE Model test. 
As discussed in section II.G.4.d. of 
this proposed rule and proposed at 42 
CFR 513.500, we propose to, when 
applicable, reduce the incremental 
GLOBE Model rebate amount for drugs 
in shortage and/or when there is a 
severe supply chain disruption or likely 
shortage, if applicable. Under the 
incremental approach, CMS would 
apply any reductions as determined 
under sections 42 CFR 427.401 and 42 
CFR 427.402 to the total GLOBE Model 
rebate amount due such that the GLOBE 
Model rebate amount due would reflect 
such reductions (if applicable). In 
addition, we propose that CMS would 
provide a GLOBE Model Rebate Report 
for each GLOBE Model drug for each 
applicable calendar quarter even in 
cases when the incremental per unit 
GLOBE Model rebate amount equals 
zero. 
If the incremental approach is 
adopted for the GLOBE Model, CMS 
would establish a GLOBE Model Rebate 
Report format that would be similar to 
the current Rebate Report format and 
would inform manufacturers of the 
GLOBE Model Rebate Report format by 
posting information on the CMS website 
and issuing a memorandum to all 
manufacturers of Part B rebatable drugs. 
c. Proposed Suggestion of Error Process 
Under the Incremental Approach 
In 42 CFR 513.720, we propose a 
Suggestion of Error process for the 
GLOBE Model such that a manufacturer 
would submit its Suggestion of Error to 
CMS, for its discretionary consideration, 
for the applicable calendar quarter 
within 10 calendar days from the date 
of receipt of a GLOBE Model 
Preliminary Rebate Report or a GLOBE 
Model Preliminary Reconciliation 
Rebate Report using a method and 
process established by CMS if the 
manufacturer believes that there is a 
mathematical error or errors to be 
corrected before the GLOBE Model 
Rebate Report or a subsequent GLOBE 
Model Reconciliation Rebate Report, as 
applicable, is finalized. CMS would 
make available a method for a 
manufacturer to submit a Suggestion of 
Error for GLOBE Model reports that 
would be substantially similar to the 
method used for the Medicare Part B 
Drug Inflation Rebate Program. Further, 
we propose that CMS would include 
any revisions to the calculation of the 
GLOBE Model rebate amount, if 
determined necessary by CMS based on 
the manufacturer’s Suggestion of Error, 
prior to providing the GLOBE Model 
Rebate Report or any GLOBE Model 
Reconciliation Rebate Report, if 
applicable. CMS would notify the 
manufacturer whether CMS revised its 
calculation of the rebate amount based 
on the Suggestion of Error. CMS notes 
that the scope of the Suggestion of Error 
process set forth in 42 CFR 513.720 
would be limited to GLOBE Model 
information and any corrections would 
not impact the information in the 
Reconciliation Rebate Report as set forth 
in 42 CFR 427.501(d)(ii). 
We welcome comment on our 
proposal for a separate Suggestion of 
Error process that would be included for 
the incremental approach if such 
approach is adopted for the model. 
H. Proposed Program Compliance 
Requirements and Enforcement 
1. Enforcement Action 
a. Enforcement of GLOBE Model Rebate 
Amount Payments by Manufacturers 
As described in section II.J. of this 
proposed rule, CMS proposes that the 
manufacturer of a GLOBE Model drug 
would be required to pay the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on 
the 30th calendar day after receipt of the 
GLOBE Model Rebate Report. 
Manufacturer payment of GLOBE 
Model rebate amounts is critical to 
model test integrity; without these 
payments, there would be limited 
ability to test potential savings to the 
Federal Supplementary Medical 
Insurance Trust Fund or impacts to 
quality of care. Given that CMS would 
reduce coinsurance for GLOBE Model

a GLOBE Model drug, CMS must collect 
GLOBE Model rebate amounts in order 
to recoup what it has spent on GLOBE 
model drugs where it paid more than 80 
percent of the allowed amount. CMS 
would need to terminate the GLOBE 
Model given the statutory requirement 
in section 1115(A)(b)(3) of the Act to 
terminate or modify models that are not 
expected to reduce spending (or those 
that improve the quality of care while 
reducing spending). Given the 
importance of these rebates, CMS may 
utilize available civil money penalty 
(CMP) authority at section 1847A(i)(7) 
of the Act or section 1128A of the Act 
to ensure timely compliance with 
payment of GLOBE Model rebate 
amounts due. 
Consistent with the Medicare Part B 
Drug Inflation Rebate Program and the 
regulations at 42 CFR 427.600 and 
513.800, CMS proposes that 
manufacturers of a GLOBE Model drug 
that have failed to timely pay the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount would be subject to a CMP in 
an amount equal to at least 125 percent 
of the incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount for such GLOBE Model drug 
and applicable calendar quarter which 
would be in addition to any unpaid 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount due. However, this GLOBE 
Model CMP is separate from and in 
addition to any civil money penalty 
assessed under 42 CFR 427.600. 
CMS further proposes to rely on the 
general CMP authority in section 1128A 
of the Act as codified in 42 CFR part 
423, subpart T. Specifically, section 
1128A(a)(8) of the Act allows a CMP to 
be imposed against anyone who 
‘‘knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be 
made or used, a false record or 
statement material to a false or 
fraudulent claim for payment for items 
or services furnished under a Federal 
health care program.’’ CMS believes that 
any manufacturer that knowingly fails 
to comply with GLOBE Model 
requirements as set forth in a regulation 
that establishes the GLOBE Model, 
including provisions in the GLOBE 
Model data agreement, could be subject 
to a CMP in addition to any incremental 
GLOBE Model rebate amount due. 
If CMS assesses a CMP for a 
manufacturer, the manufacturer would 
be held responsible for paying the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount of any CMP amount imposed, 
and any amount imposed for late 
payment. The CMP payment would be 
due within 60 days after the date of 
notice of imposition of the CMP 
according to section 1128A of the Act. 
In the event of non-payment of any 
portion of the total GLOBE Model rebate 
amount, CMS considered other potential 
enforcement approaches. For example, 
CMS could refer manufacturers to the 
Department of Justice (DOJ) for breach 
of contract or false certification, 
Department of the Treasury for their use 
of the Debt Management or Recovery 
Offset Programs, or the Department of 
Health and Human Services’ (HHS’) 
Office of Inspector General (OIG) for use 
of their CMP authority and for further 
review and investigation. However, 
given the importance of recovering 
GLOBE Model rebate amounts due from 
manufacturers, CMS believes it would 
be appropriate to pursue CMPs in order 
to enforce payments of the total GLOBE 
Model rebate amount. 
In the event that a manufacturer 
declares bankruptcy, as described in 
Title 11 of the United States Code, and 
as a result of the bankruptcy, fails to pay 
either the full GLOBE Model rebate 
amount owed or the total sum of CMP 
imposed, or both, the government 
intends to reserve the right to file a 
proof of claim with the bankruptcy 
court to recover the unpaid amount of 
the GLOBE Model rebate amount and/or 
CMP owed by the manufacturer as set 
forth in 42 CFR 513.800. 
We propose to codify civil money 
penalty and appeals procedures for 
GLOBE Model rebate amounts at 42 CFR 
part 513, subpart I. 
b. Other Enforcement Actions 
We propose that CMS could impose 
one or more enforcement actions such 
as CMP or terminating the data 
agreement if CMS determines that the 
following has occurred, which is not an 
exhaustive list: 
€The GLOBE participant has submitted false data or made false 
representations, warranties, or 
certifications in connection with any 
aspect of the GLOBE Model. 
€The GLOBE participant is subject to investigation or action by HHS 
(including the HHS–OIG, CMS, or FDA) 
or the DOJ due to an allegation of fraud 
or significant misconduct, including 
being subject to the filing of a complaint 
or filing of a criminal charge, being 
subject to an indictment, being named 
as a defendant in a False Claims Act qui 
tam matter in which the Federal 
Government has intervened, or similar 
action. 
We propose that CMS may take one or 
more of the following enforcement 
actions if CMS determines that one or 
more of the grounds for enforcement 
action described in section H.1. of this 
proposed rule had taken place: 
€Suspending or terminating the data agreement with the manufacturer. 
€Require the manufacturer to provide additional requested 
information to CMS or its designees. 
€Subject the manufacturer to additional monitoring, auditing, or both. 
As part of the Innovation Center’s 
monitoring and assessment of the 
impact of models tested under the 
authority of section 1115A of the Act, 
CMS has a special interest in ensuring 
that these model tests do not interfere 
with the program integrity interests of 
the Medicare program. For this reason, 
CMS monitors actions of GLOBE 
participants for compliance with model 
terms, as well as other Medicare 
program rules. When CMS becomes 
aware of noncompliance with these 
requirements, it is necessary for CMS to 
have the ability to impose certain 
administrative enforcement actions on a 
noncompliant model participant. We 
seek comment on these proposed 
provisions regarding the proposed 
grounds for enforcement actions, 
enforcement actions generally, and 
whether additional types of enforcement 
action would be appropriate. 
I. Proposed Collection of GLOBE Model 
Rebate Amounts 
1. Proposed Systems To Collect GLOBE 
Model Rebate Amounts 
In 42 CFR 513.740, we propose that 
the deadline and process for payment of 
rebate amounts, including rebate 
amounts owed by a manufacturer, 
failure to pay a rebate amount, and 
potential refunds to a manufacturer, as 
articulated in 42 CFR 427.505 would 
apply to GLOBE Model rebate amounts 
calculated under the GLOBE Model. The 
process for manufacturer access to 
rebate reports as codified in 42 CFR 
427.504 would apply to Rebate Reports 
including GLOBE Model rebate amounts 
(that is, combined rebate amounts, 
under the combined invoicing approach 
described in section II.G.8. of the 
proposed rule and incremental GLOBE 
model rebate amounts under the 
incremental invoicing approach 
described in section II.G.8. of the 
proposed rule, as applicable) calculated 
under the GLOBE Model, including any 
report of reconciled rebate amounts. In 
addition, we propose that the date of 
receipt, 30 days after which payment is 
due, as codified in 42 CFR 427.500, 
would be the calendar day following the 
day on which a report of a GLOBE 
Model rebate amount (as set forth in 42 
CFR 513.510) is made available to the 
manufacturer of a GLOBE Model drug 
by CMS.

1. General 
Consistent with the evaluation 
provisions of section 1115A(b)(4) of the 
Act, CMS proposes utilizing quality 
measures to monitor and evaluate 
whether quality of care, including as 
measured through patient-level 
outcomes, changes as a result of the 
proposed alternative Part B inflation 
rebate amount calculation approach for 
GLOBE Model drugs. Payments to 
manufacturers or providers would not 
be adjusted based on quality of care. 
CMS would consider multiple domains 
of monitoring as outlined below, 
including but not limited to out-of- 
pocket costs, utilization of care, and 
access to GLOBE Model drugs. 
2. Collection of Quality Measures 
CMS proposes utilizing claims-based 
measures or existing national surveys, 
such as the Medicare Current 
Beneficiary Survey, when possible, to 
monitor the quality of care in a way that 
directly reflects patient-level factors. 
These may include measures to 
monitor— 
€Part B drug utilization and prescribing patterns—such as changes 
in medication treatment, or cessation of 
treatment earlier than expected given 
disease course; 
€Out-of-pocket costs for Part B drugs that were administered—comparing 
costs for beneficiaries with and without 
supplemental prescription drug 
coverage based on available data; 
€Frequency and regularity of administration of Part B drugs, such as 
inappropriate gaps between 
administration of infusions or 
injections; 
€Changes in site of service for a beneficiary receiving administration of 
Part B drugs; 
€Changes in site of service for outpatient clinic appointments; 
€Changes in prescriber of the Part B drug; and 
€Downstream health care utilization, such as hospitalizations or emergency 
room visits. 
CMS may also find it necessary to 
supplement claims-based measures with 
voluntary surveys of providers who 
administer Part B drugs to assess 
variables including but not limited to 
changes in: (1) perceived prescribing 
practices as a result of this alternative 
payment approach; (2) site of service for 
administration of clinician-administered 
drugs; and (3) interactions between 
patient and provider. 
When developing this proposed 
quality strategy, CMS considered a 
range of quality measures, including 
high-value prescribing of efficacious 
Part B drugs, medication management, 
barriers to access, medication 
adherence, patient experience of care 
measures, and drug-related adverse 
events. 
CMS does not anticipate this test of a 
new payment approach would impact 
high value prescribing as the payment 
incentive directly to the prescribers is 
equivalent between the intervention and 
control group (ASP +6 percent). 
Accurate measurement of medication 
management and medication adherence 
for Part B clinician-administered drugs 
is challenging because dosing schedules 
are variable, clinical assessment is 
required, and insurance claims lack 
sufficient clinical context.
132
To limit 
additional burden upon beneficiaries, 
CMS proposes using existing national 
surveys wherever possible. If necessary 
to assess how the GLOBE Model has 
affected patient quality of care, CMS 
may consider implementing a 
beneficiary survey. 
This proposed model does not test the 
efficacy of prescription drugs, but 
rather, it tests the impact of an 
alternative payment approach. Thus, 
CMS does not propose new monitoring 
of changes to drug-related adverse 
events. CMS would monitor changes in 
downstream health care utilization, 
such as changes in rates of emergency 
room visits, hospitalizations, or use of 
other clinical services. Any additional 
measures, including potentially 
beneficiary surveys, utilized by CMS 
would not add significant burden to 
GLOBE Model participants or 
beneficiaries. 
CMS welcomes comments on the 
proposed quality measures above to 
monitor changes in the quality of care 
that may result from this alternative Part 
B inflation rebate amount calculation 
approach. 
K. Proposed Beneficiary Protections 
1. General 
CMS recognizes stakeholders may 
have concerns over potential 
disruptions to beneficiary access to 
Medicare Part B drugs, including those 
that are GLOBE Model drugs, as a result 
of the GLOBE Model changing financial 
incentives for manufacturers. To 
alleviate these concerns, CMS has 
considered various options to protect 
beneficiary access to Medicare Part B 
drugs during the model performance 
period. 
One potential option CMS has 
considered is creating a reporting 
system where stakeholders, such as 
providers or beneficiaries, could notify 
CMS that a particular drug has become 
harder to source or obtain after the 
implementation of the GLOBE Model. A 
reporting system such as this could 
allow CMS to gather information to 
inform potential follow-up 
investigations to determine if any drug 
access issues are occurring. As such, 
CMS proposes setting up a GLOBE 
Model reporting system open to 
providers and beneficiaries to notify 
CMS that a particular drug has become 
harder to source or obtain. CMS also 
proposes to conduct investigations as 
appropriate based on information 
reported to the system, including but 
not limited to requesting additional 
information from the submitter and 
conducting additional analyses to 
determine whether the report requires 
further action from CMS or other 
governmental entities. One possibility 
for how this system could work is 
including GLOBE Model reporting 
within the 1–800–Medicare system. 
Additionally, CMS could develop an 
email inbox to receive reports from 
providers and beneficiaries. CMS may 
develop multiple ways to receive 
reports. Instructions for how to report, 
using one or more methods, would be 
posted on the CMS website for 
awareness. CMS could also consider 
making beneficiaries aware of the 
available reporting methods by sending 
letters to eligible GLOBE Model 
beneficiaries with reporting 
instructions. 
CMS welcomes comments on a 
potential plan to build a GLOBE 
reporting and monitoring system for 
stakeholders and any other methods to 
protect beneficiaries. 
2. Alternatives Considered 
CMS Innovation Center models 
frequently include various policies to 
protect beneficiaries from any negative 
intended or unintended consequences 
of models. One of the most common 
forms of beneficiary protections CMS 
Innovation Center Models include are 
policies that allow beneficiaries to 
choose to be excluded from a model. 
These usually take the form of a letter 
sent to beneficiaries that would be 
included in the Innovation Center 
Model outlining what the model is and 
how it might impact beneficiaries. 
These letters then usually include a 
section allowing the beneficiary to opt- 
out of the model by changing to a 
provider not included in the model, or 
some other general opt-out mechanism.

Standardized payments also exclude 
geographic differences and certain Medicare 
payment adjustments (for example, graduate 
medical education payments) to make Medicare 
payments comparable across providers nationwide. 
For more information, please see the CMS Payment 
Standardization Overview provided by the Research 
Data Assistance Center (ResDAC). 
CMS has considered including a 
beneficiary opt-out within the GLOBE 
Model as an additional protection for 
beneficiaries but has chosen to not move 
forward with a beneficiary opt-out at 
this time. While CMS acknowledges the 
GLOBE Model may affect drug access, 
CMS believes that the likelihood of 
reduced access is relatively low. GLOBE 
Model beneficiaries are expected to 
benefit from the program through lower 
coinsurance costs for GLOBE Model 
drugs, removing the potential for 
downside risk for beneficiaries. Not 
including a beneficiary opt-out would 
enhance the model test integrity and 
improve the generalizability of results, 
as there would not be a selection bias 
among beneficiaries who choose to 
remain in the model if an opt-out were 
offered. CMS believes that beneficiaries 
would benefit by being categorized as an 
elgible GLOBE Model beneficiary due to 
the potentially reduced coinsurance 
percentage that would apply for eligible 
GLOBE Model drugs for GLOBE Model 
beneficiaries. 
CMS seeks comment on the decision 
not to include a beneficiary opt-out and 
whether variations of a beneficiary opt- 
out could be considered. 
L. Proposed Monitoring and Compliance 
Actions 
1. General Provisions: Monitoring and 
Compliance 
The CMS Innovation Center has 
described general provisions for 
monitoring and compliance for CMS 
Innovation Center models at 42 CFR 
512.150. However, we note that many of 
these provisions would not apply to the 
GLOBE Model, and the GLOBE Model is 
substantially different from other 
mandatory CMS Innovation Center 
models. 
Instead, CMS intends to monitor for 
specific potential issues that could arise 
as part of the GLOBE Model. CMS 
intends to monitor for major changes in 
beneficiary access, as viewed through 
changes in site of care, provider, and 
other measures described in section II.J. 
of this proposed rule. CMS may also 
monitor changing list prices in the U.S. 
to determine whether any changes to 
model policies or duration could be 
necessary in future performance 
periods. CMS may also consider 
monitoring impacts on drug innovation, 
research & development, and timing of 
drugs coming to market in the U.S. CMS 
also proposes to collaborate with the 
Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to 
review shortage lists and determine 
whether the number of drugs or length 
of time on the shortage list changes over 
time. To the extent that CMS identifies 
an issue through regular monitoring that 
would require a change to model 
policies or duration under section 
1115A(b)(3)(B) of the Act, CMS would 
take necessary action to change a model 
policy or model duration based on its 
finding. 
2. Appeals Process 
CMSI proposes that the appeals 
processes established in 42 CFR 
427.600, subpart T would apply. 
Additionally, the enforcement 
provisions of section 1847A(i)(8) of the 
Act and the judicial review section 
1847A(j) of the Act would apply. 
We seek comment on our proposal to 
apply administrative procedures 
established in 42 CFR 427.600, subpart 
T, along with judicial review provisions 
of section 1847A(i)(8) and (j) of the Act. 
M. Interaction With Other Models and 
Programs 
1. Approach for Overlap With Other 
Models 
In designing each CMS Innovation 
Center model, CMS considers potential 
overlap between a new model and other 
ongoing and potential models and 
programs. Based on the type of overlap, 
such as participating entity, health care 
provider or beneficiary, operating rules 
may be established for whether or not 
entities, health care providers and 
beneficiaries can be part of both models 
as well as how to handle overlap when 
it occurs. These policies help to ensure 
that the evaluation of model impact is 
not compromised by issues of model 
overlap and that double counting of 
health care providers, beneficiaries and 
dollars across different models does not 
occur. 
As discussed in section II.F. of this 
proposed rule, CMS is proposing to test 
the GLOBE Model in selected 
geographic areas because we believe 
that this approach would best allow the 
model evaluation to observe the impacts 
of the model. We considered whether 
additional design modifications, such as 
testing models in different geographic 
areas, or operational adjustments would 
be necessary for a robust test of the 
GLOBE Model in situations where 
ongoing and potential models and 
programs would also apply and 
concluded that none were warranted at 
this time because we intend for the 
GLOBE Model monitoring activities and 
evaluation to observe for potential 
behavioral changes (such as in 
prescribing or patterns of care) and 
other potential impacts on non-model 
aspects of the Medicare program and 
other models and programs. For 
example, as discussed in section II.J. of 
this proposed rule, we propose to 
monitor for prescribing shifts and 
potential impacts on beneficiaries’ 
access to care. If, during implementation 
of the proposed GLOBE Model, we were 
to observe unintended impacts on 
beneficiaries or model operations (for 
example, in GLOBE Model geographic 
areas we observe an increase in Part D 
utilization of clinician-administered 
drugs), we intend to propose 
appropriate operational adjustments to 
the GLOBE Model through notice and 
comment rulemaking. 
In developing the proposed GLOBE 
Model, CMS conducted an internal 
review of which models and programs 
could have potential overlap with the 
GLOBE Model. As a result of our 
review, we expect there may be 
situations where an eligible GLOBE 
Model beneficiary who receives a 
GLOBE Model drug would also be 
assigned, aligned, or attributed to 
another Innovation Center model or 
CMS program or initiative. Overlap 
could also occur among health care 
providers and suppliers, health plans, 
prescription drug plans, and other 
entities that participate in such models, 
programs or initiatives. We do not 
believe that health care provider or 
beneficiary overlap between the GLOBE 
Model and other models, programs and 
initiatives would impact our ability to 
conduct the GLOBE Model evaluation or 
interpret findings. Therefore, we are not 
proposing adjustments to the GLOBE 
Model when there is overlap of health 
care providers that prescribe, 
pharmacies and other entities that 
furnish or dispense, or beneficiaries 
who receive GLOBE Model drugs. 
Instead, other CMS Innovation Center 
models and CMS programs and 
initiatives, as determined by CMS, 
would make adjustments as necessary to 
accommodate the GLOBE Model test 
and maintain the integrity of such 
models, programs and initiatives. For 
example, the Enhancing Oncology 
Model (EOM)
133
uses standardized 
payment amounts
134
and, as applicable, 
other adjustments to ensure that 
expenditures included in EOM 
calculations (such as benchmarks and 
performance year expenditures) reflect 
amounts that would have been paid by 
Medicare in the absence of other CMS

APMs see https://qpp.cms.gov/apms/overview. 
initiatives, and that payments or 
recoupments are not double counted. 
Specifically, EOM uses standardized 
allowed amounts in calculations that 
include Part B drug claims. The 
Medicare Part B allowed amount 
represents the Medicare payment limit 
before beneficiary cost sharing liability 
is applied. Therefore, the proposed 
GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance 
percentage adjustment when applicable 
is not expected to impact EOM 
calculations. Other CMS Innovation 
Center models and CMS programs also 
use standard payment amounts in 
calculations (for example, to calculate 
benchmarks, target expenditures, total 
cost of care, and shared savings) and 
would also not be expected to be 
impacted by claims that would be paid 
under the proposed GLOBE Model, and 
the proposed reduced beneficiary 
coinsurance was applied. Of note, some 
existing models and programs would 
not have overlap at the health care 
practitioner or participant level and do 
not impact manufacturers due to the 
way in which the model or program 
operates and makes payments. 
In response to the proposed GLOBE 
Model beneficiary coinsurance 
adjustment policy discussed in section 
II.G.7. of this proposed rule, health care 
providers and beneficiaries may 
increase use of GLOBE Model drugs that 
qualify for lower coinsurance and/or 
manufacturers may adjust the sales 
price of GLOBE Model drugs. To the 
extent that changes in drug prices and/ 
or beneficiary coinsurance amounts 
result in more appropriate provision of 
care, other CMS Innovation Center 
models and CMS programs and 
initiatives that reward efficient use of 
Medicare and Medicaid services could 
experience additional impacts from the 
design of such models, programs and 
initiatives because of overlap with the 
proposed GLOBE Model. 
We anticipate model overlap may 
occur between the proposed GLOBE 
Model and future CMS models or 
programs not yet implemented. If the 
proposed GLOBE Model is finalized, 
CMS would take the GLOBE Model into 
consideration in the development of 
future model designs to address 
potential impacts of overlap with the 
GLOBE Model. 
In summary, we are not proposing to 
modify or adjust any CMS Innovation 
Center model or CMS program or 
initiative where model overlap with the 
proposed GLOBE Model would occur. 
If, in the future, CMS determines a 
modification or adjustment to the 
GLOBE Model or other CMS Innovation 
Center model or CMS program or 
initiative is necessary for purposes of 
testing the GLOBE Model or other CMS 
Innovation Center model or to operate a 
CMS program or initiative, CMS would 
pursue such modification or adjustment 
at such time through the appropriate 
mechanisms, for example, modifications 
or adjustments to the GLOBE Model 
would be pursued through notice and 
comment rulemaking whereas it might 
be appropriate for modifications or 
adjustments to other CMS Innovation 
Center models or CMS programs and 
initiatives to be pursued through 
updates to model policies and data 
agreements, or program participation 
criteria or requirements. 
We seek comments on our proposed 
approach to address overlap between 
the proposed GLOBE Model and other 
ongoing or future CMS Innovation 
Center models and CMS programs as 
described in this section of this 
proposed rule. We also seek comment 
on the potential need for any specific 
modifications or adjustments to the 
proposed GLOBE Model that would be 
necessary to support a robust model test 
of the proposed GLOBE Model or other 
CMS Innovation Center model. We also 
welcome comments on the potential 
ways the proposed GLOBE Model may 
impact CMS programs and initiatives 
and the potential need for modifications 
or adjustments to the proposed GLOBE 
Model that may be necessary to 
minimize overlap impacts. 
2. Quality Payment Program 
The proposed GLOBE Model would 
not qualify as an Alternative Payment 
Model (APM) under the Quality 
Payment Program (QPP) or as a Merit- 
based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) 
Alternative Payment Model (MIPS 
APM).
135
Specifically, the proposed 
GLOBE Model participants would be 
manufacturers of GLOBE Model drugs, 
and those entities are not health care 
providers and do not qualify to 
participate in the QPP or MIPS APM. 
Medicare allowed amounts for claims 
for GLOBE Model drugs submitted by 
health care providers that are eligible for 
participation in the QPP would not be 
changed under the proposed GLOBE 
Model. Therefore, the cost element of 
the QPP would not be impacted by the 
proposed GLOBE Model. 
N. Interaction With Other Federal 
Programs 
The proposed GLOBE Model may 
have impacts on other federal programs, 
such as Medicaid, the 340B Program, 
the Veterans Health Administration, the 
Department of Defense, the Public 
Health Service, the Coast Guard, and 
Medicare. 
1. Impact on Medicaid 
a. Impact on Medicaid ‘‘Best Price’’ 
With respect to single source or 
innovator multiple source drugs (which 
Medicaid recognizes to include 
biologicals), the term ‘‘Medicaid Best 
Price’’ is the lowest price available from 
the manufacturer during the rebate 
period to any wholesaler, retailer, 
provider, health maintenance 
organization, non-profit entity or 
governmental entity within the U.S. 
with certain exclusions. That is, a 
manufacturer’s best price determination 
represents the lowest price available 
from the manufacturer during a rebate 
period (a quarter) to best price eligible 
entities or purchasers in the U.S. only. 
In accordance with section 
1927(c)(1)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act, a 
manufacturer’s best price determination 
is inclusive of cash discounts, free 
goods that are contingent on any 
purchase requirement, volume 
discounts, and rebates other than 
rebates under section 1927 of the Act, 
section 1847A(i) of the Act, or section 
1860D–14B of the Act. Because 
proposed GLOBE Model rebates would 
be paid by manufacturers pursuant to 
section 1847A(i) of the Act, the 
proposed GLOBE Model rebates 
themselves would not be included in 
the manufacturer’s best price 
determination. 
We expect that the proposed GLOBE 
Model would lead manufacturers to 
seek to adjust prices in order to lower 
the amount of GLOBE Model rebates 
they would owe. In addition, awareness 
of the proposed GLOBE Model would 
likely drive an increase in purchasers’ 
interest in obtaining lower drug prices 
from manufacturers. The model may 
indirectly impact a manufacturer’s best 
price to the extent that a manufacturers’ 
U.S. best price would be lower than 
what it would be otherwise. In other 
words, if during the course of the 
GLOBE Model, market forces result in 
manufacturers reducing prices available 
to purchasers and such prices are 
included in a manufacturer’s 
determination of best price, a 
manufacturer’s best price could 
potentially be lower and possibly 
increase Medicaid rebates. This is 
particularly possible because the 
proposed GLOBE Model rebates would 
be based in part on pricing outside of 
the U.S., which are typically lower than 
prices in the U.S., and may impact the 
prices made available by the 
manufacturer in the U.S.

Inhalation, infusion, instilled, implanted or 
injectable drugs. 
137
For more information about the 340B ceiling 
price calculation see https://340bpricing
submissions.hrsa.gov/Help/Manufacturer/ 
Pricing%20Formulas/Pricing%20Formulas.htm. 
b. Impact on Average Manufacturer 
Price (AMP) 
AMP is defined at section 1927(k)(1) 
of the Act. Generally, AMP is 
determined based on the average price 
paid to the manufacturer for a covered 
outpatient drug in the U.S. by 
wholesalers for drugs distributed to 
retail community pharmacies and retail 
community pharmacies that purchase 
drugs directly from the manufacturer 
with certain exclusions. The proposed 
GLOBE Model would focus on certain 
Part B rebatable drugs. Because Part B 
rebatable drugs are typically furnished 
in the outpatient setting and these drugs 
are most likely injected or infused, the 
AMP for GLOBE Model drugs that are 
identified as 5i drugs
136
may be 
impacted by the model. The AMP 
computation for 5i drugs includes sales 
that are not generally dispensed through 
retail community pharmacies (see 
section 1927(k)(1)(B)(i)(IV) of the Act, 
42 CFR 447.504(d)), such as sales to 
physicians, pharmacy benefit managers 
(PBMs) and hospitals. 
Because proposed GLOBE Model 
rebates would be paid by manufacturers 
pursuant to section 1847A(i) of the Act, 
the GLOBE Model rebates themselves 
would not be included in a 
manufacturer’s AMP for a GLOBE 
Model drug in accordance with section 
1927(k)(1)(B)(i)(VII) of the Act. If the 
manufacturer lowers prices for GLOBE 
Model drugs in the U.S., the 
manufacturer’s AMP for a GLOBE 
Model drug may be lower. If a drug’s 
AMP decreases, it may result in 
potentially lowering the applicable 
Medicaid drug rebate paid (the rebate, 
in part, is based on a percentage of 
AMP). However, as previously 
discussed in section VI.D. of this 
proposed rule, the GLOBE Model may 
also have indirect impacts that could 
lower a manufacturer’s best price for a 
GLOBE Model drug. The resulting effect 
on the Medicaid drug rebate would 
depend upon the relationship of any 
AMP change and any best price change. 
We also note that if the AMP for a 
GLOBE Model drug is lowered it may be 
more likely that, in accordance with 
section 1847A(d) of the Act, the 
Inspector General may find that the ASP 
for a GLOBE Model drug exceeds the 
AMP for such drug, and that, in 
accordance with section 
1847A(d)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, the 
circumstances in which 103 percent of 
AMP is substituted for the ASP-based 
price in CMS’ determination of the 
payment allowance for such drug would 
occur. 
2. Interaction With 340B Program 
The Health Resources and Services 
Administration (HRSA) administers the 
340B Drug Pricing Program that allows 
certain hospitals and other health care 
providers (‘‘covered entities’’) to obtain 
discounted prices on ‘‘covered 
outpatient drugs’’ (as defined at 
1927(k)(2) of the Act) from drug 
manufacturers. HRSA calculates a 340B 
ceiling price for each covered outpatient 
drug, which represents the maximum 
price a manufacturer can charge a 
covered entity for the drug that is 
provided to an eligible patient. Several 
types of hospitals as well as clinics that 
receive certain federal grants from the 
HHS may enroll in the 340B program as 
covered entities. Billing units associated 
with claims for GLOBE Model drugs 
that are submitted with a 340B modifier 
and paid for under Part B would be 
excluded from the total GLOBE Model 
rebate amount in accordance with 42 
CFR 427.303(1) as discussed in section 
II.G.4. of this proposed rule. 
a. Impact on 340B Ceiling Price 
Covered entities that enroll in the 
340B Program can purchase covered 
outpatient drugs at no more than a 
‘‘ceiling price,’’ which is calculated as 
AMP minus Medicaid unit rebate 
amount.
137
We note that some 340B 
hospitals can obtain covered outpatient 
drugs at less than the ceiling price. 
Since the Medicaid unit rebate amount 
is based partly on AMP minus best 
price, to the extent the proposed GLOBE 
Model may indirectly affect a drug’s 
AMP and best price, the 340B prices 
would be affected. 
3. Interaction With Medicare 
a. Medicare Part B 
As discussed in section VI.D. of this 
proposed rule, we believe the proposed 
GLOBE Model would result in lower net 
Medicare spending for GLOBE Model 
drugs, including lower beneficiary cost- 
sharing, and in overall reduced Federal 
Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust 
Fund expenditures, which in turn could 
lower Medicare FFS expenditures and 
beneficiaries’ Part B premiums. We 
estimate that total Medicare Part B FFS 
savings would amount to $8.4 billion 
over the model test period and that 
there would be additional beneficiary 
premium savings of $1.4 billion over the 
model test period. 
As discussed in section VI.D. of this 
proposed rule, manufacturers’ ASPs for 
GLOBE Model drugs may be higher or 
lower than they otherwise would be 
absent the proposed GLOBE Model. In 
turn, Medicare Part B FFS payments 
(before sequestration) to providers and 
suppliers for GLOBE Model drugs could 
be higher or lower than what the 
payments would have been absent the 
model. We note that, consistent with 
section 1927(c)(1)(C)(ii)(I) of the Act and 
section 1847A(c)(3) of the Act, because 
the GLOBE Model rebate amounts are 
rebates under section 1847A(i) of the 
Act, manufacturers would not include 
GLOBE Model rebates in the calculation 
of Medicaid Best Price and the 
manufacturer’s average sales price. 
We note that if the AMP for a GLOBE 
Model Part B drug is lowered it may be 
more likely that, in accordance with 
section 1847A of the Act, the Inspector 
General may find that the ASP for a 
GLOBE Model drug exceeds the AMP 
for such drug, and that the 
circumstances in which 103 percent of 
AMP is substituted for ASP in CMS’ 
determination of the payment allowance 
for such drug would occur. 
b. Medicare Advantage 
Medicare Advantage (MA) plans and 
beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans 
would not be included in the proposed 
GLOBE Model. We note that when MA 
plans pay non-contracted, out of 
network providers who have 
administered a GLOBE Model drug to an 
enrollee, the amount paid would 
continue to be based on the Medicare 
FFS payment amount (that is, the 
amount that MA plans would pay to 
these providers would reflect the non- 
model payment amount) and the 
beneficiary coinsurance must not 
exceed 50 percent of the plan’s total 
financial liability or the non-model 
Medicare FFS allowed amount per 42 
CFR 422.100(f)(6)(i). When MA plans 
pay contracted, in-network providers 
who have administered a GLOBE Model 
drug to an enrollee, beneficiary 
coinsurance must not exceed the 
coinsurance percentage listed in the 
applicable non-model quarterly ASP 
file), consistent with the requirements of 
42 CFR 422.100(j)(1). 
As discussed in section IV.B. of this 
proposed rule, we expect the proposed 
GLOBE Model would lower overall net 
Medicare FFS expenditures; that is, 
Medicare Part B net payment amounts 
for GLOBE Model drugs would be lower 
than such payment would be absent the 
model, and the model would result in 
an overall reduction in Medicare 
expenditures. The overall decrease in 
Medicare FFS expenditures would be 
considered in determining the historical 
FFS claims experience for calculating 
the rates for plan service areas.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260308 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules Payments to MA organizations may be 
lower than they would be absent the 
model, resulting from lower MA 
benchmarks and bids. At a high level, 
the FFS component of the non-ESRD 
MA rates is based on the product of the 
projected national per-capita spending 
and a county-level relative cost index. 
Thus, if the proposed GLOBE Model is 
finalized, the MA rate book calculations 
would reflect changes in actual FFS 
spending due to the impact of the 
GLOBE Model. We note that this 
approach is consistent with treatment of 
payments made under other CMS 
Innovation Center models and the 
Medicare Shared Savings Program. 
As discussed in section IV.D. of this 
proposed rule, we estimate that MA 
benchmarks and bids may be lower, 
resulting in $10.4 billion in savings over 
the model period. In turn, MA plans 
may reduce supplemental benefits and 
increase MA beneficiary out-of-pocket 
costs. We note that there is much 
uncertainty around the assumptions for 
this estimate. 
O. Medicare Program Waivers 
1. Overview 
We believe it may be necessary to 
waive certain requirements of title XVIII 
of the Act for the testing of the GLOBE 
Model. We propose to issue these 
waivers using our waiver authority 
under section 1115A(d)(1) of the Act. 
Section 1115A(d)(1) of the Act provides 
authority for the Secretary to waive such 
requirements of title XVIII of the Act as 
may be necessary solely for the 
purposes of carrying out section 1115A 
of the Act with respect to testing models 
described in sections 1115A(b) of the 
Act. This provision affords broad 
authority for the Secretary to waive 
statutory Medicare program 
requirements as necessary to carry out 
the provisions of section 1115A of the 
Act with respect to testing models. 
We welcome comments on other 
possible waivers under section 1115A of 
the Act of certain Medicare program 
rules beyond those specifically 
discussed in this proposed rule that 
might be necessary to test this model. 
We would consider the comments 
received during the public comment 
period and may make future proposals 
regarding program rule waivers during 
the course of the model test. 
2. Waiver of the Calculation of the 
Rebate Amount 
In proposed 42 CFR 513.1000(a), we 
propose to waive program requirements 
that are necessary solely for the 
purposes of testing the GLOBE Model. 
Specifically, we propose to waive the 
Medicare Part B inflation rebate 
calculation provisions, as described in 
section 1847A(i)(3) of the Act and 42 
CFR 427.302 and 42 CFR 427.301, 
which describes the calculation of the 
rebate amount. We believe this is 
necessary in order to implement the 
proposed alternative calculation for the 
GLOBE Model rebate amount as 
described in section II.G. of this 
proposed rule. We seek comment on our 
proposed waiver of the Medicare Part B 
inflation rebate calculation provisions 
as described in section 1847A(i)(3) of 
the Act. 
We believe that section 1115A of the 
Act is broad and grants us significant 
flexibility in the design and 
implementation of new models. Further, 
section 1115A(b)(2)(A) the Act provides 
the Secretary with broad authority to 
test alternative payment models where 
‘‘there is evidence that the model 
addresses a defined population for 
which there are deficits in care leading 
to poor clinical outcomes or potentially 
avoidable expenditures.’’ We believe 
this supports our implementation of the 
GLOBE Model test and innovative 
payment models. This model test 
modifies the Part B inflation rebate 
amount calculation for GLOBE Model 
drugs using international drug pricing 
information to identify a benchmark 
that reflects prices paid in a set of 
economically comparable countries. 
CMS expects these modifications would 
reduce program expenditures for 
Medicare Part B while preserving or 
enhancing beneficiaries’ quality of care. 
Further, the Secretary has the authority 
under section 1115A(d)(1) of the Act to 
waive certain Medicare and Medicaid 
statutory requirements ‘‘as may be as 
may be necessary solely for purposes of 
carrying out this section with respect to 
testing models.’’ 
As such, we believe the proposed 
waiver of the Medicare Part B inflation 
rebate amount calculation provisions 
section 1847A(i)(3) of the Act is 
necessary in order to implement the 
proposed alternative calculation for the 
rebate amount as described in section 
II.G. of this proposed rule. Specifically, 
we believe waiving the existing 
calculation for the rebate amount under 
section 1847A(i)(3) of the Act as part of 
the GLOBE Model is necessary in order 
to implement an alternative calculation 
for the rebate amount using 
international pricing information. 
We seek comment on our proposed 
waiver of the Medicare Part B inflation 
rebate amount calculation provisions as 
described in section 1847A(i)(3) of the 
Act. 
3. Waiver of Timing Requirements 
In proposed 42 CFR 513.1000(b), we 
propose to waive program requirements 
that are necessary solely for the 
purposes of testing the GLOBE Model. 
As described in section II.G.8. of this 
proposed rule, we are considering two 
proposals for invoicing GLOBE Model 
rebate amounts. Under both approaches, 
we propose to waive section 1847A(i)(1) 
of the Act and instead we propose the 
following deadlines, effective dates, and 
time period requirements for the GLOBE 
Model under either option. 
For the combined invoicing approach, we note that the increased operational 
complexity would lengthen the time 
necessary for creating Rebate Reports, 
which would extend the time following 
the end of an applicable calendar 
quarter for manufacturers to pay rebates. 
As described in section II.G.8. of this 
proposed rule, we propose that no later 
than 8 months after the end of each 
calendar quarter beginning October 1, 
2026, CMS would, for all Part B 
rebatable drugs and for each GLOBE 
Model Drug, report to the manufacturer 
the information described in section 
II.G.8. of this proposed rule and the 
information in 42 CFR 427.501. We also 
propose, for each calendar quarter 
beginning on or after October 1, 2026, 
the GLOBE manufacturer of a GLOBE 
Model Drug shall, for such drug, not 
later than 30 days after the date of 
receipt of the information for such 
calendar quarter, provide to CMS the 
total GLOBE Model rebate amount as set 
forth in 42 CFR 513.520 for such drug 
for such calendar quarter. 
For the incremental invoicing approach, we note that the Preliminary 
Rebate Reports and Rebate Reports 
issued as part of the Medicare Part B 
Drug Inflation Rebate Program must 
necessarily be delivered before the 
GLOBE Model Preliminary Rebate 
Report and GLOBE Model Rebate Report 
can be issued. As such, we similarly 
propose that for each calendar quarter 
we propose that no later than 8 months 
after the end of each calendar quarter 
beginning October 1, 2026, CMS would, 
for each GLOBE Model Drug, report to 
the manufacturer the information 
described in section II.G.8. of this 
proposed rule. We also propose, for 
each calendar quarter beginning on or 
after October 1, 2026, the GLOBE 
manufacturer of a GLOBE Model drug 
must, for such drug, not later than 30 
days after the date of receipt of the 
information for such calendar quarter, 
provide to CMS the total GLOBE Model 
rebate amount as set forth in 42 CFR 
513.520 for such drug for such calendar 
quarter.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260309 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules As described in section II.G. of this 
proposed rule, we believe these waivers 
are necessary to implement the GLOBE 
Model on the timeline proposed herein 
given various operational considerations 
necessary to calculate GLOBE Model 
rebate amounts. Under the combined 
invoicing approach, we believe that by 
issuing Rebate Reports 2 months later 
than specified in section 1847A(i)(a)(1) 
of the Act, CMS would be able to both 
calculate the necessary information for 
a comprehensive Rebate Report as well 
as align with the need to provide 
information about Medicare Part B drug 
inflation rebate amounts and GLOBE 
Model rebate amounts to GLOBE 
Manufacturers timely. As such, under 
the combined invoicing approach we 
propose waiving section 1847A(i)(1)(A) 
of the Act to the extent necessary to 
allow CMS to issue Rebate Reports no 
later than 8 months after the end of a 
calendar quarter during the GLOBE 
Model performance period. Under the 
incremental invoicing approach, we 
believe that delivering the incremental 
GLOBE Model Rebate Report 2 months 
later than specified in section 
1847A(i)(a)(1) of the Act, CMS would be 
able to conduct the necessary 
calculations in order to provide the 
information needed for the incremental 
GLOBE Model Rebate Report. As such, 
under the incremental invoicing 
approach, we propose waiving section 
1847A(i)(1)(A) of the Act to the extent 
necessary to allow CMS to provide the 
rebate amount information to 
manufacturers. 
We seek comments on our proposed 
waiver of section 1847A(i)(1) of the Act. 
4. Waivers of Section 1833 of the Act 
(Payment of Benefits) 
As described in section II.E.6. of this 
proposed rule, we intend to implement 
an alternative calculation for beneficiary 
coinsurance and, in conjunction with 
this calculation, adjust the Medicare 
payment for the GLOBE Model drug 
claim. Accordingly, we believe it would 
be necessary to waive sections 
1833(a)(1), 1833(a)(1)(S), 1833(a)(1)(EE), 
and 1833(t) of the Act in order to 
implement these changes as they relate 
to payment to providers and beneficiary 
coinsurance amount. In addition, we 
believe it would be necessary to waive 
provisions in 42 CFR 410.152(m), 
419.41(e), 489.30(b)(1), and 489.30(b)(6). 
Without these waivers, CMS would not 
be able to carry out the model test of 
implementing an alternative calculation 
for beneficiary coinsurance and 
correspondingly adjust the Medicare 
payment for the GLOBE Model drug 
claim in the same manner as under the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program. 
P. Evaluation 
We would conduct an evaluation of 
the proposed GLOBE Model, as required 
under section 1115A(b)(4) of the Act. 
The evaluation would analyze the 
quality of care furnished under the 
model and the changes in spending 
under Medicare by reason of the model. 
The evaluation would include the 
collection of representative information 
from manufacturers of GLOBE Model 
drugs, drug purchasers, providers, and 
beneficiaries. The collection and 
analysis of these data would inform how 
the GLOBE Model might function if it 
were certified and expanded nationally. 
All Innovation Center models, which 
would include the GLOBE Model, are 
rigorously evaluated on their ability to 
improve quality without increasing 
costs or reduce costs without reducing 
quality. In addition, we routinely 
evaluate monitoring data from 
Innovation Center models for potential 
unintended consequences that run 
counter to the stated objective of 
lowering costs without adversely 
affecting quality of care. The design and 
evaluation methods, the data collection 
methods, key evaluation research 
questions, the evaluation period and 
anticipated reports for the GLOBE 
Model are outlined as follows. 
1. Evaluation Methods 
The evaluation methodology accounts 
for GLOBE’s innovative payment model 
that modifies the Part B inflation rebate 
amount calculation for certain Part B 
rebatable drugs that are single source 
drugs and sole source biological 
products to account for prices paid in 
economically comparable countries. 
CMS expects this would reduce program 
expenditures for Medicare Part B while 
preserving or enhancing beneficiaries’ 
quality of care. The evaluation would 
employ a design to provide evidence 
that the proposed intervention would 
reduce the cost of these drugs and 
would maintain or enhance the quality 
of care for Medicare beneficiaries. The 
first objective would be to estimate the 
change in the net savings to Medicare 
due to the model intervention. The 
second objective would be to examine 
any changes to the quality of care and 
out-of-pocket costs of Part B rebatable 
drugs for the cohort of beneficiaries 
subject to the model intervention 
compared to a comparison cohort of 
eligible beneficiaries not randomized to 
the model intervention. 
The impact of the model would be 
measured by comparing the change in 
key outcomes in GLOBE Model regions 
to non-selected regions. We are 
considering several populations of 
interest for the GLOBE Model 
evaluation, such as Medicare 
beneficiaries who are likely to receive 
one of the Part B rebatable drugs based 
on recent diagnoses and/or prior 
treatment and populations defined by 
recent diagnoses (for example, those 
diagnosed with cancer, rheumatoid 
arthritis, ophthalmologic conditions) 
and/or prior treatment to capture the 
model’s impact on beneficiaries directly 
affected by the changes due to the 
model. 
Medicare spending would be 
examined in terms of total Part B drug 
spending for Part B rebatable drugs, 
total Part B drug spending for any Part 
B drugs, total Parts A and B spending, 
and potentially other spending 
measures for specific types of health 
care services (for example, inpatient 
hospital spending). The evaluation of 
the model’s impact on quality of care 
would examine beneficiary out of 
pocket spending and drug access, 
measured by utilization (for example, 
rates of any use and duration of use) of 
both Part B drugs (including Part B 
rebatable drugs, GLOBE Model drugs, 
and other Part B drugs) and Part D drugs 
(particularly, for Part D drugs that can 
substitute for Part B rebatable drugs). 
We would also examine non-drug health 
care utilization that may change because 
of the GLOBE Model to estimate any 
impacts on access to care. Examples of 
other non-drug health care utilization 
include hospitalizations, emergency 
department visits, and condition 
specific utilization related to a given 
subgroup of beneficiaries. The impact 
estimates would reflect the collective 
effect of the GLOBE Model’s changes to 
Medicare payments and beneficiary 
cost-sharing for GLOBE Part B rebatable 
drugs. 
2. Data Collection Methods 
We are considering multiple sources 
of data to evaluate the effects of the 
GLOBE Model. We expect to base much 
of our analysis on secondary data 
sources such as Medicare enrollment 
and claims data. Beneficiary level 
claims data would be analyzed to 
estimate expenditures in total and by 
type of drug and service. We would 
examine other sources of data that may 
include rebate or provider discount 
information, and international pricing 
data. 
For Part B drugs, we would analyze 
data on drug utilization patterns, 
pricing, and expenditures in the original 
‘‘fee-for-service’’ Medicare program. We 
would give strong preference to existing 
surveys and available data collected for

other purposes and would consider 
CMS evaluation contractor administered 
site visits, interviews or surveys with 
selected manufacturers, physicians/ 
practitioners, wholesale drug 
purchasers, and beneficiaries necessary 
to measure quality of care. These 
qualitative sources would provide 
information that would help us 
understand better the dynamics and 
interactions occurring among the 
stakeholders in the GLOBE Model that 
cannot be estimated using the proposed 
secondary data sources. 
3. Key Evaluation Research Questions 
Our evaluation research questions are 
structured to assess the impact of the 
GLOBE Model on reducing Medicare 
expenditures and preserving or 
enhancing quality of care. To the extent 
possible, we would explore how net 
savings, if any, were related to specific 
aspects of the payment test, such as how 
the alternative benchmarks were 
identified (42 CFR 513.410 and 42 CFR 
513.420, Identification of the per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark and 
Identification of the per unit Method II 
GLOBE Model benchmark, 
respectively), characteristics of the 
GLOBE Model drugs, manufacturers, 
and beneficiaries, and other secondary 
analyses. Our key evaluation questions 
would include, but are not limited to, 
the following: 
€Medicare Payments. Did the GLOBE Model result in net savings to Medicare, 
and if so, how? 
€Market Impact. How did manufacturer behavior change in 
response to the GLOBE Model? Is there 
evidence of broader changes to the 
pharmaceutical market, such as changes 
in the supply of drugs or to drug 
pricing? 
€Quality. What was the impact of the GLOBE Model on the patient’s quality of 
care? Did beneficiaries’ cost sharing or 
access to drugs change under the model, 
and if so, how? Were there changes in 
drug or other health service utilization 
patterns that can be attributed to the 
model? Were there shifts in utilization 
from Part B to Part D drugs? 
€Unintended Consequences. Did the GLOBE Model result in unintended 
consequences? 
The GLOBE Model evaluation would 
gather evidence to inform certification 
through a rigorous, evidence-based 
process to determine how this model 
would perform if expanded nationally 
across the Medicare program. The 
evaluation would provide evidence to 
demonstrate if the model achieved its 
goals during the test period. It would 
also assess if the results were 
generalizable at a national scale and 
financially and operationally 
sustainable. 
4. Evaluation Period and Anticipated 
Reports 
As proposed, the GLOBE Model 
would have a 7-year test period, 
including a 5-year performance period 
and a 7-year payment period beginning 
on October 1, 2026. The evaluation 
period would encompass the entire test 
period, with a baseline period of up to 
3 years prior. Continued evaluation after 
the test period is necessary to assess the 
impact of the GLOBE Model on 
reducing Medicare expenditures and 
preserving or enhancing quality of care. 
We plan to evaluate the GLOBE Model 
on a continuous basis and release public 
evaluation reports annually. 
We recognize that interim results are 
subject to changing policies and issues 
such as sample size and market 
fluctuations. Hence, while CMS intends 
to conduct periodic summaries to offer 
useful insight during the model test, a 
final analysis after the end of the model 
test period would be important for 
ultimately synthesizing and validating 
results. 
If during our evaluation, results 
indicate statistically significant savings 
while preserving or enhancing the 
quality of care, the Secretary could 
recommend legislative action to 
facilitate the development or expansion 
of the model or a portion of the model. 
III. Collection of Information 
Requirements 
Section 1115A of the Act authorizes 
the CMS Innovation Center to test 
innovative payment and service 
delivery models that preserve or 
enhance the quality of care furnished to 
Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s 
Health Insurance Program beneficiaries 
while reducing program expenditures. 
As stated in section 1115A(d)(3) of the 
Act, Chapter 35 of title 44, United States 
Code, shall not apply to the testing and 
evaluation of models under section 
1115A of the Act. As a result, the 
information collection requirements 
contained in this proposed rule need 
not be reviewed by the Office of 
Management and Budget. 
IV. Preliminary Regulatory Impact 
Analysis 
A. Statement of Need 
As discussed in section I.B. of this 
proposed rule, studies have revealed 
that U.S. prices for prescription drugs 
are 422 percent higher than other 
countries.
138
Further, CMS data and 
other studies show that Medicare Part B 
FFS drug spending
139
has grown by 
85.8 percent ($18.7 billion)
140
from 
2014 to 2021 with the standard monthly 
Medicare Part B premium for 
beneficiaries increasing by 41.5 percent 
($104.90
141
to $148.50,
142
) and that the 
pace of growth has varied across disease 
categories. For example, according to a 
recent report,
143
drugs classified in 
immunology, oncology, rheumatology, 
endocrinology and ophthalmology are 
among the top 20 therapeutic classes 
based on spending or prescriptions 
volume in the United States and drugs 
in these categories have shown notable 
growth between 2023 and 2024. This 
trend is also observed in Medicare Part 
B FFS drugs, where these five 
therapeutic classes represent at least $24 
billion in Medicare Part B FFS allowed 
charges in 2024.
144 145 146
Under the IRA, 
some Medicare beneficiaries have seen 
savings for some drugs,
147
but recent 
surveys revealed that Medicare 
beneficiaries continue to experience 
challenges in access to medication due 
to cost.

Medicare spending doubled 
between 2010 and 2023, increasing from 
$0.05 trillion to $1 trillion, and it is 
projected to reach nearly $2 trillion by 
2033. Studies have also shown that 
increased high drug costs limit access to 
care and treatment that lead to worse 
health outcomes, including avoidable 
hospitalizations and premature 
death.
153 154
CMS analysis of claims data 
shows that total Medicare spending in 
2024 was $70.71 billion, and that almost 
two-thirds of this spending was 
attributed to Medicare Part B rebatable 
drugs. Separate data show that Medicare 
is the largest single purchaser of health 
care in the U.S., and accounts for 23 
percent of total personal health care 
cost.
155
Further, data reveal that 
Medicare Part FFS program spending is 
highly concentrated among a small 
number of beneficiaries—the costliest 
25 percent of beneficiaries accounted for 
85 percent of Medicare spending.
156
The 
associated costs of medication non- 
adherence due to cost can be significant 
(up to $290 billion per year).
157
 
This rulemaking is necessary to 
implement and test an innovative 
payment model that modifies the Part B 
inflation rebate amount for GLOBE 
Model drugs using international drug 
pricing information to reduce 
expenditures and improve quality of 
care. Specifically, as described in 
section II.G. of this proposed rule, the 
model test would include more than one 
method for identifying a benchmark 
amount for the modified rebate 
calculation and the model evaluation 
would assess the impacts of using 
different sources for international drug 
pricing information. CMS expects that 
the innovative alternative rebate 
calculation would reduce Medicare 
expenditures and beneficiary 
coinsurance amounts for Medicare Part 
B while preserving or enhancing 
beneficiaries’ quality of care. 
As detailed in sections II.A. through 
D. of this proposed rule, the proposed 
GLOBE Model would establish a 7-year 
GLOBE Model alternative payment test 
for a subset of separately payable 
Medicare Part B rebatable drugs that are 
furnished in the outpatient setting to 
Medicare beneficiaries who are in the 
cohort and that are paid under the 
GLOBE Model, or ‘‘Globe Model drugs.’’ 
As described in section II.E. of this 
proposed rule, and subject to certain 
exclusions as discussed in section II.B.2. 
of this proposed rule, participants 
would include manufacturers of GLOBE 
Model drugs. GLOBE Model 
participants would be subject to the 
participation requirements, as 
applicable, during the GLOBE Model 
test period as described in sections II.E. 
and II.G.6. of this proposed rule. 
B. Overall Impact 
We have examined the impacts of this 
proposed rule as required by Executive 
Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning 
and Review (September 30, 1993); 
Executive Order 13132, ‘‘Federalism’’; 
Executive Order 14192, ‘‘Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation’’; the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (Pub. 
L. 96–354); section 1102(b) of the Act 
(impact on small rural hospitals); and 
section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (Pub. L. 
104–4). 
Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 
direct agencies to assess all costs and 
benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, 
environmental, public health and safety 
effects, distributive impacts, and 
equity). Section 3(f) of Executive Order 
12866 defines a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ as an any regulatory action that 
is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) 
have an annual effect on the economy 
of $100 million or more, or adversely 
affect in a material way a sector of the 
economy, productivity, competition, 
jobs, the environment, public health or 
safety, or State, local, or Tribal 
governments or communities; (2) create 
a serious inconsistency or otherwise 
interfere with an action taken or 
planned by another agency; (3) 
materially alter the budgetary impacts of 
entitlement grants, user fees, or loan 
programs or the rights and obligations of 
recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel 
legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, the President’s priorities, or 
the principles set forth in E.O. 12866. 
A regulatory impact analysis (RIA) 
must be prepared for a regulatory action 
that is significant under section 3(f)(1) 
of E.O. 12866. Based on our analysis, the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs (OIRA) has determined this 
rulemaking is significant pursuant to 
section 3(f)(1) of E.O. 12866. 
Accordingly, we have prepared a 
regulatory impact analysis that presents 
the estimated costs and benefits 
associated with this proposed 
rulemaking. 
C. Accounting Statement and Table 
As required by OMB Circular A–4, 
(available at https://trumpwhitehouse.
archives.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/ 
omb/circulars/A4/a-4.pdf) in Table 10, 
we have prepared an accounting 
statement showing the transfers and 
costs associated with the provisions of 
this proposed rule over a 7-year period 
versus a 10-year period reflecting the 
proposed 5-year performance period of 
the GLOBE Model beginning in October 
2026 and the proposed 7-year payment 
period. This Table 10 was based on the 
analysis discussed in the ‘‘Estimated 
Impacts of the Proposal’’ section in this 
RIA. The costs for manufacturers to 
prepare submissions associated with 
voluntary net price reporting, discussed 
in section IV.D.3. of this proposed rule, 
was not directly included since after 
rounding, these costs are negligible. We 
estimate that the GLOBE Model would 
result in an overall savings of $8.4 
billion in Medicare Part B FFS net 
spending during the model before 
accounting for changes in the Part B 
premium. In this estimate, we assume 
manufacturer behavior changes and 
beneficiary utilization changes. We also 
estimate savings for the MA program of 
$7.5 billion before accounting for 
changes in the Part B premium due to 
the way CMS calculates MA payments 
using Medicare FFS claims which 
would include claims paid under the

setting for 2028, and savings for the 
Medicaid program of almost $1.0 
billion, of which roughly $0.5 billion 
would be federal savings and roughly 
$0.3 billion would be state savings. 
When annualized over 2026 to 2032 we 
estimate that the GLOBE Model would 
result in an overall cost savings in 
Medicare Part B FFS net spending of 
approximately $2.3 billion at both the 3 
and 7 percent rates of discount. 
D. Estimated Impacts of the Proposal 
In this section we discuss the 
estimated overall impact of the 
proposed GLOBE Model on the 
Medicare and Medicaid programs. We 
also show the paperwork (information) 
burden. 
1. Estimated Impacts to Medicare 
The proposed GLOBE Model modifies 
the existing Part B inflation rebate 
amount calculation for certain rebatable 
drugs administered to beneficiaries 
under Medicare Part B. For beneficiaries 
in model geographic areas, the specified 
amount for model drugs would be 
compared to an international 
benchmark and the inflation-adjusted 
payment amount, with the manufacturer 
rebating any excess to CMS (referred to 
as the ‘‘incremental GLOBE Model 
rebate amount’’ as set forth in 42 CFR 
513.510). The rebates would exclude 
units that are currently exempt from the 
existing Part B inflation rebate amount 
calculation, including 340B and most 
categories of dual eligible beneficiaries. 
Certain drugs may be excluded from the 
model based on therapeutic categories, 
spending thresholds, ineligibility for the 
Medicare Part B Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program, or competitive status within 
the market. These estimates assume that 
all manufacturers of proposed GLOBE 
Model drugs are included in this 
mandatory model. If certain 
manufacturers were excluded due to 
interactions with other CMS Innovation 
Center models or for any other reason, 
the impacts from this proposed 
demonstration could be significantly 
less than described in this analysis. The 
model does not change the Medicare 
Part B payment limit, including the add- 
on payment, which would remain at 6 
percent of ASP for most Part B drugs. In 
developing our estimate of the potential 
Medicare savings of the model we 
started with 2024 Part B claims data for 
GLOBE Model drugs. CMS’ Office of the 
Actuary (OACT) relied on CMS’ 
Innovation Center for a list of drugs that 
would have been included in the model 
had the proposed model been tested 
based in 2024 data, and we estimate that 
GLOBE Model drugs would have 
comprised approximately 54 percent of 
non-dual, non-340B Part B FFS drug 
spending for 2024. The model excludes 
drugs that are paid based on a maximum 
fair price that has been negotiated 
through the Medicare Drug Price 
Negotiation Program; as drugs are 
selected for the negotiation program and 
have a payment limit that is based on 
a maximum fair price, we expect the 
proportion of drugs included in the 
GLOBE Model would decrease over 
time. We estimated which drugs would 
have an effective maximum fair price 
during the model performance period 
and reduced the model rebate to 
account for the exclusion of these drugs 
from the model. OACT’s estimates of 
which drugs would be negotiated were 
developed independently, without 
input from Medicare Drug Rebate and 
Negotiation Group within CMS. By the 
end of the model window, we estimate 
that GLOBE Model drugs would 
comprise approximately 21 percent of 
non-dual, non-340B Part B FFS drug 
spending for 2024, which reflects the 
increased amount of spending expected 
to be subject to the Medicare Drug Price 
Negotiation Program over time. The 
model geographic areas would be 
selected to comprise 25 percent of Part 
B FFS beneficiaries further reducing the 
drug spending targeted by the GLOBE 
Model. Additionally, the numeric 
estimates of benefit savings (as 
displayed in Tables 11 and 12) in this 
analysis reflect the impacts of the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount, which would be the amount 
CMS would collect in addition to what 
CMS collects through the Medicare Part 
B Drug Inflation Rebate Program. 
To reflect the international 
benchmarks that would be used in the 
model we relied on international data 
furnished from IQVIA MIDAS, after 
adjustments for GDP and purchasing 
power parity. On average these 
international benchmarks were 71 
percent below the 2024 ASPs for GLOBE 
Model drugs. This would reflect the 
upper limit of potential savings as we 
expect that manufacturers and other 
stakeholders may engage in a variety of 
responses that may impact the potential 
savings of the model. 
Our first anticipated manufacturer 
reaction is to report their international 
net price data to CMS in cases where 
that data show higher prices than the 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark. 
Under the GLOBE Model, manufacturers 
would be eligible to report net 
international pricing data, and if those 
prices are higher than the Method I 
benchmarks, the Method II benchmarks 
would become the applicable 
benchmark for the GLOBE Model rebate 
calculation. This effect would have an 
upward pressure on applicable 
benchmarks over time and would 
reduce the GLOBE Model rebate 
amounts paid by manufacturers. 
Our estimate assumes that the 
manufacturer reporting would reduce 
the total GLOBE Model rebate amount 
by 35 percent by the end of the model 
test period. This assumption is informed 
by the average difference between the 
lowest reference country price and 
prices averaged over all reference 
countries (after adjustments for GDP and 
purchasing power parity) for GLOBE 
Model drugs (see Table 11).

response to the model will likely need 
time to implement changes to the 
international prices. Accordingly, we 
phased this adjustment into our 
analysis, beginning with a 10 percent 
change to 2026 price data and reaching 
35 percent in the 2029 price data. These 
factors are applied at an aggregate level 
to the rebates calculated under the 
Method I benchmarks. For example, the 
total GLOBE model rebate amount paid 
based on 2026 fourth quarter utilization 
using the Method I benchmark is 
reduced by 10 percent in our impacts to 
reflect this manufacturer response. 
Table 12 shows the percentage 
adjustment by performance year. 
We also anticipate that there would be 
some collaboration between 
manufacturers and providers to 
incentivize the increased use of white- 
bagging, where drugs would be 
reimbursed for under the Part D benefit 
while still being administered in an 
office/facility setting, allowing the 
manufacturer to avoid owing a GLOBE 
Model rebate amount for those units. 
We compared current total Part B drug 
spending for GLOBE Model drugs to 
comparable NDC’s in the Part D program 
to identify drugs that have a high 
potential to be moved to the Part D 
benefit. Combined with assumptions 
about how much utilization would 
move, we estimate that this effect would 
further reduce total GLOBE Model 
rebate amounts by an additional 2.6 
percent. 
We also included an induced 
utilization effect reflecting the potential 
for increased use of drugs among FFS 
beneficiaries in model regions in 
response to lower cost sharing required 
for GLOBE Model drugs. As many FFS 
beneficiaries are either dual status or 
have supplemental prescription drug 
coverage, we estimate a relatively small 
1.2 percent increase in total gross Part 
B drug spending on average in the first 
model year for beneficiaries in model 
geographic areas. This effect decays over 
time reflecting the lower expected total 
GLOBE Model rebate amounts over the 
life of the model. 
After accounting for the above effects, 
we calculated the expected Medicare 
FFS benefit savings after accounting for 
reduced coinsurances for beneficiaries 
in model geographic areas. We then 
calculated the expected changes in MA 
benchmarks and the corresponding 
change in MA payments, under the 
assumption that the model would be 
incorporated into the contract year 2028 
rate development. The total federal 
savings account for the fact that the 
beneficiaries share the lower estimated 
benefit payments through reduced Part 
B premiums. Table 13 represents the 
final estimated benefit savings and the 
proportion reflected in beneficiary Part 
B premiums versus federal government 
savings on a fiscal year cash basis. No 
impact is shown for 2033 due to 
payments in 2033 relating to reconciling 
prior payments, and the amount of this 
reconciliation is not known at this time. 
In addition to changes from the model 
resulting in reduced MA benchmarks 
and bids, MA plans would likely need 
to reduce supplemental benefits as well. 
Since the MA plans that bid below their 
benchmarks are paid a portion of this 
difference as an MA rebate, it follows 
that a reduction in benchmarks reduce 
the MA rebates. MA plans use these 
rebates for supplemental benefits, such 
as premium reductions or reductions in 
beneficiary cost-sharing, which would 
increase MA beneficiary out-of-pocket 
costs. 
The model would result in beneficiary 
savings by reducing the Part B premium 
for all beneficiaries. Additionally, FFS 
beneficiaries would see a reduced 
coinsurance on model drugs via the 
existing mechanism for adjusting the 
Part B coinsurance for drugs with a 
Medicare Part B drug inflation rebate 
amount. Table 14 shows impacts to 
beneficiaries on a calendar year basis.

Note: Totals may not add up due to rounding. 60314 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules We also considered the following 
responses but either determined their 
impact would be small or that we lacked 
sufficient data to quantify the level of 
impact they would have on GLOBE 
Model rebates: 
€We expect that manufacturers with drugs selected for the Medicare Drug 
Price Negotiation Program would be less 
inclined to give discounts below the 
statutorily specified ceiling price. We 
expect this effect to be small based on 
the ceiling prices specified by the 
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for Part 
B drugs. 
€As 340B units are excluded from the GLOBE Model rebate amount, we 
would expect manufacturers to 
incentivize the increased utilization of 
these units. However, we do not believe 
there is much potential for this shift as 
most model drugs have a relatively low 
proportion of 340B units currently and 
the difference between 340B pricing and 
the benchmark prices for the model are 
unknown. 
€As a change in list prices for model drugs would shift the balance between 
the GLOBE Model rebate amount and 
the Medicare Part B inflation rebate 
amount, there are incentives for 
manufacturers to raise list prices across 
all payers to counteract the lost revenue 
from the model. This reaction could 
create additional effects on Medicaid or 
Federal Marketplace spending. The 
likelihood of this response increases the 
higher the spending is for a given drug 
outside of Medicare. We welcome 
comments on the probability and 
magnitude of this response to inform 
future analysis. 
€Since drugs with an MFP that applies would be excluded from the 
model, we might expect manufacturers 
would try to change their pricing to 
become eligible for the Medicare Drug 
Price Negotiation Program if they see it 
being more favorable for their 
reimbursement. Given the criteria for 
being selected for the Medicare Drug 
Price Negotiation Program, we believe it 
would be difficult for manufacturers to 
achieve this. Additionally, the model 
does not impact reimbursement for all 
FFS beneficiaries as negotiations would, 
so this response would require dramatic 
pricing differences to be favorable to 
manufacturers. 
€The GLOBE Model does not include MA plans and so manufacturers may be 
inclined to assist in efforts to increase 
MA enrollment if they find MA 
reimbursement would be higher than 
Medicare FFS. It is not clear how much 
more favorable MA reimbursement 
would be for manufacturers and so we 
have not included this in our estimates. 
We seek comment on the potential 
response from manufacturers and 
corresponding impacts to MA plan 
enrollment and reimbursement to 
inform future analysis. 
2. Estimated Impacts to Medicaid 
Medicaid savings of the GLOBE 
Model would be reflected via the 
reduced cost sharing and premiums that 
Medicaid pays on behalf of dual 
beneficiaries in the model geographic 
areas. Based on historical experience we 
expect that 30 percent of the reduced 
cost sharing would come from dual 
beneficiaries, with the federal 
government retaining 57 percent of 
those savings and states retaining the 
rest. Based on historical experience we 
expect that approximately 19 percent of 
the Part B premiums are paid by 
Medicaid on behalf of dual 
beneficiaries, with the federal 
government retaining 57 percent of 
those savings and states retaining the 
rest. Table 15 shows Medicaid impacts 
on a calendar year cash basis. 
3. Negligibility of Paperwork 
(Information) Burden 
As discussed in section III. of this 
proposed rule, Chapter 35 of title 44, 
United States Code, does not apply to 
the testing and evaluation of models 
under section 1115A of the Act. That is, 
models are exempt from paperwork 
(information) burden requirements. 
Nevertheless, and for discussional 
purposes only, we briefly review the 
main paperwork burden of this 
proposed rule and show it is negligible. 
The main information burden arises 
from voluntary manufacturer-reported 
submission of international net pricing 
information. The analysis of cost is 
summarized in Tables 16 and 17 with 
line items explained afterwards. Table 
16 presents an analysis of items for

must comply with the requirements of 
42 U.S.C. 1396r–8,42 U.S.C. 256b, 38 
U.S.C. 8126. As a subset of these 
manufacturers could be impacted by the 
GLOBE Model, we obtained a list of 
manufacturers, designated by labeler 
codes, of Medicare Part B rebatable 
drugs in 2024 as of June 2025. This list 
was based on initial, non-final data and 
there were 61 unique labeler codes on 
that list. Based on a hypothetical 
analysis of how many manufacturers 
would participate in the GLOBE Model 
using 2024 data, we concluded that the 
GLOBE Model would only apply to a 
subset of manufacturers of Part B 
rebatable drugs given the drug 
inclusions and exclusions described in 
section II.B. of this proposed rule. As a 
conservative estimate meant to include 
more manufacturers than likely would 
participate in the GLOBE Model, we 
used 40 manufacturers. This number is 
used for the initial estimate in Table 16, 
reflecting quantifiable information. A 
second table, Table 17, addresses the 
reasonable assumption that this number 
would fluctuate from year to year. 
Line Items 3 and 4: The hours 
required for submission are split 
between preparation, including reading 
rules, gathering data, and so forth, and 
actual submission. We used similar 
estimates of submission to CMS from a 
Supporting Statement of the 
Manufacturer Submission of Average 
Sales Price (ASP) for Medicare Part B 
Drugs and Biologicals and Supporting 
Regulations in 42 CFR 414.800–806 
(CMS–10110, OMB 0938–0921) from 
2023. The supporting document listed 
10 hours for preparation and 3 hours for 
submission. However, we believe that 
extra hours would be required for the 
first year, and in the absence of more 
reliable data we simply doubled the 10 
and 3. 
Line Item 7: The GLOBE Model 
performance period, during which 
manufacturers could choose to report, is 
proposed to last from October 2026 
through September 2031. Hence, in 
2026, the model performance period 
includes only 1 calendar quarter (25 
percent of the year) and in 2031 the 
model performance period includes 3 
calendar quarters (75 percent of the 
year). 
Lines 9a through 9f: The $21.90 is the 
mean wage obtained from the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics website for Secretaries 
and Administrative Assistants, 
Occupational Code 43–6014, for the 
latest year available at this time, 2024. 
Note that CMS still uses mean wages 
even though many agencies use median 
wages. However, replacing the mean by 
the median would not change the 
conclusion of negligibility. 43–6014 is 
the same occupational title used for 
estimates in OMB 0938–0921. However, 
we determined that this approach (using 
only administrative assistants) was 
overly simplified. While administrative 
assistants are appropriate staff for the 3 
hours submission, we assume the 
preparation would involve a team of 
administrative assistants, health care 
managers, software engineers, lawyers, 
and pharmacists. The mean hourly wage 
of these staff for 2024 are displayed 
along with their occupational titles and 
code. The wages of these five staff are 
combined to produce a single mean 
hourly wage for the team. In the absence 
of further data, the weights assume that 
all five staff work equally in the 10 
hours of preparation resulting in 2 hours 
per staff. The administrative staff 
exclusively work during the 3 hours of 
submission. Thus, the weights are five- 
thirteenths for administrative staff and 
two-thirteenths for each of the other 
staff. 
Line 10: Per HHS guidance,
158
CMS 
uses a factor of 2 to account for overtime 
and fringe benefits. 
We next turn to items for which we 
have no basis on which to quantify. The 
total analysis is presented in Table 17. 
As noted in Table 17, there are two non- 
quantifiable issues that have to be 
addressed. 
New and departing participants: Each 
year, the group of GLOBE Model 
participants may change based on 
whether their drug meets the criteria for 
inclusion in the GLOBE Model. We have 
no way of estimating with accuracy 
whether a given manufacturer would be 
included or excluded in the GLOBE 
Model. If we assume 4 new 
manufacturers, then bottom line 
estimates from Table 16 would increase 
10 percent (4/40). This is a low estimate. 
In an alternative scenario, the number of 
participants might increase as much as 
50 percent corresponding to a factor of 
1.5; although this is unlikely, it helps 
define a range of possible costs. 
19 Countries: If a manufacturer were 
to opt to report manufacturer-submitted 
data, they would do so for a set of 
reference countries, up to 19 countries 
as discussed in section II.G.1.e. of this 
proposed rule. The 10 hours of 
preparation assumed in Table 16 
provides time for each GLOBE Model 
participant to address marketing, 
pricing, and licensing requirements. But 
likely, this is different for different 
countries. We do not have enough 
information to quantify this. We 
approach the extra time as a factor by 
which we increase cost. For example, 
assuming that half the countries require 
the same preparation time, we would 
multiply the bottom line cost burden by 
a factor of 9.5 (19/2). On the other hand, 
if data on licensing, marketing, and 
pricing for each individual country are 
readily available, it might only require 
an extra 2 hours of work resulting in an 
increase of 1.15 (2/13). We take these as 
the low and high estimates and insert an 
intermediate estimate. 
To obtain a range of adjusted bottom 
line estimates we multiply the factors 
together. For example, as discussed 
previously, if half the countries require 
the same amount of work (resulting in 
a factor of 9.5) and if the number of 
participants increases 50 percent 
(resulting in a factor of 1.5) then we 
multiply the bottom line number from 
Table 10, $1,151,270 by 14.25 (1.5 * 9.5) 
and obtain a high cost burden of 
$16,405,603 million as shown in Table 
17. As shown on the bottom line of 
Table 17, the resulting range of 
estimates of cost burden is between 
roughly $1.5 million and $16.5 million.

Using data on the total number of employees 
inside and outside the U.S., the estimated percent 
of small entities is 3.5 percent. 
E. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
requires agencies to analyze options for 
regulatory relief for small entities. For 
purposes of the RFA, small entities 
include small businesses, nonprofit 
organizations, and small governmental 
jurisdictions. Individuals and states are 
not included in the definition of a small 
entity. The RFA requires that CMS 
analyze regulatory options for small 
businesses and other entities unless 
CMS certifies that a rule would not have 
a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
The analysis must include a justification 
concerning the reason action is being 
taken, the kinds and number of small 
entities the proposed rule affects, and an 
explanation of any meaningful options 
that achieve the objectives with less 
significant adverse economic impact on 
the small entities. 
HHS considers a significant impact on 
a substantial number of small entities, to 
be one with a 3 percent revenue effect 
on 5 percent of small entities.
159
As 
discussed in section II. of this proposed 
rule, manufacturers that are GLOBE 
Model participants would pay GLOBE 
Model rebates to the Medicare Part B 
account in the Federal Supplementary 
Medical Insurance Trust Fund if the 
amount specified in section 
1847A(i)(3)(A)(ii)(I) of the Act for a 
GLOBE Model drug exceeds a 
benchmark amount that would be based 
on available international drug pricing 
information (as described in section 
II.G.1. of this proposed rule), and would 
not be less than any rebate owed under 
the Medicare Part B Drug Inflation 
Rebate Program. Our analysis shows 
that the proposed rule, would impact 7 
percent of small entities, and the impact 
is estimated to represent up to 2.6 
percent of the small entities’ annual 
revenue in the United States. Given the 
uncertainty on manufacturer response 
and available data, CMS concludes that 
this proposed rule, if finalized as 
proposed, would have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. This analysis, 
as well as other sections in this 
proposed rule, serves as the Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis, as required by the 
RFA. 
1. Description and Number of Affected 
Small Entities 
We use the North American Industry 
Classification System (NAICS) to 
identify the industry potentially affected 
by the proposed rule. We also use the 
Small Business Administration (SBA) 
size standards to identify small 
entities.
160
The SBA considers any 
‘‘Pharmaceutical Preparation 
Manufacturing’’ firm (NAICS code 
325412) with fewer than 1,300 
employees as a small business. 
We use financial and employment 
information publicly available on 
annual reports published on companies’ 
websites or submitted to the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) for 
2024 to identify revenue and 
employment information for the 
potentially affected companies. Most 
companies self-identified as ‘‘global’’ 
and provided information separately for 
their global consolidated business and 
for the United States. For purposes of 
this analysis, we use revenue and 
employment size information based on 
data reported for the United States. We 
used the Internal Revenue Service’s 
yearly average currency exchange rates 
for 2024 to convert revenue information 
into U.S. dollars when this information 
was provided in a foreign currency.
161
 
We identified 30 manufacturers that 
would be associated with 61 GLOBE 
Model drugs. Using the financial data, 
we determined that two of the 30 
manufacturers are subsidiaries of larger 
companies. For purposes of this 
analysis, we consider the impact on the 
28 unique parent companies. Table 18 
shows that 7 percent of the affected 
manufacturers would be considered 
small based on the SBA definition.
162
In 
2024, the total company revenue in the 
United States for these small companies 
exceeded $2 billion (the average U.S. 
revenue per small company exceeded $1 
billion). These companies accounted for 
about 0.45 percent ($2,045/$456,292) of 
the total U.S. revenue among the 28 
affected entities. The potential GLOBE 
Model drugs associated with these small 
entities are classified as immunological 
agents and antineoplastics for which 
there are at least a dozen other drugs 
that are in the same therapeutic class as 
determined by the number of HCPCS 
Level II codes in the USP DC 
classification category used for this 
analysis. Further, based on CMS 
expertise the potential GLOBE Model 
drugs associated with these small 
entities have therapeutically equivalent 
substitutes.

Description of the Potential Impacts 
on Small Entities 
CMS anticipates that payments to 
CMS in the form of GLOBE Model 
rebate amounts, as set forth in 42 CFR 
513.500 of this proposed rule, would 
represent the largest impact to small 
entities. We estimate the impact using 
two approaches. Under the first 
approach, we use available data to 
estimate an average GLOBE Model 
rebate per company ($26 million), 
including both large and small 
manufacturers. Using this estimate as an 
upper bound, we estimate that GLOBE 
Model rebates could represent up to 2.6 
percent of a small entity’s average 
revenue in the U.S. ($26 million/$1 
billion). In the second approach we 
assume that 1.64 percent of the 
estimated incremental GLOBE Model 
rebate amount would be associated with 
small entities, and then estimate the 
potential incremental GLOBE Model 
rebate amount for the small entities 
affected. The estimate of 1.64 percent 
was derived separately from OACT’s 
analysis because OACT’s overall 
estimates in the RIA represent 
aggregates across all companies. Using 
this estimate, and OACT’s estimate of 
the total incurred calendar year GLOBE 
Model rebates, we estimate the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amounts would range from $0.00 to 
$49.37 million for small entities over 
the model performance period. Table 17 
presents the estimated incremental 
GLOBE rebate amounts for small entities 
and the corresponding impact on total 
revenue. Based on our analysis and 
using available data on total revenue 
and estimated incremental GLOBE 
Model rebates, CMS estimates that the 
estimated incremental GLOBE Model 
rebate amounts would represent up to 
2.4 percent of small entities’ total 
revenue, as measured in terms of 
revenue in the U.S. The administrative 
costs involved with reading and 
understanding this proposed rule are 
not included in these estimates. 
However, as noted in the RIA, these 
costs are estimated to be negligible. 
CMS notes that these estimates are 
based on available data which could 
change in the future and as such, the 
estimated impacts could vary. 
Specifically, the estimates are based on 
the current status of rebatable drugs, 
employment and revenue information 
using 2024 or other available data as of 
the publication of this proposed rule. 
Given this uncertainty, CMS concludes 
that the proposed rule, if finalized as 
proposed, would have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. CMS welcome comments on 
our conclusion, approach, assumptions, 
and data used to estimate these impacts. 
As discussed previously, we also 
considered other responses, including 
limited price reductions for drugs 
selected for the Medicare Drug Price 
Negotiation Program, increased 
utilization of 340B units, changes in list 
pricing information, changes in 
incentives to participate in the Medicare 
Drug Price Negotiation Program, 
impacts to MA plans and Medicaid, and 
either determined their impact to be 
small or that there was insufficient data 
to properly quantify their impact. We 
note that there is much uncertainty 
around the assumptions for these 
estimates. We welcome comments on 
our estimate of significantly affected 
small manufacturers and the magnitude 
of estimated effects. We also welcome 
comments on adjustments to the GLOBE 
Model that could be considered while 
preserving the innovative approach to 
payment in the GLOBE Model. 
3. Alternatives To Minimize the Impact 
on Small Entities 
CMS considered the following 
alternatives to minimize the impact on 
small entities: (1) establishing a 
different spending threshold; (2) 
establishing an exemption process; and 
(3) establishing different compliance 
dates. 
€Spending threshold: As discussed in section II.B. of this proposed rule, 
CMS is proposing to include drugs or 
biological products that meet the 
proposed definition of a GLOBE Model 
drug which would include a subset of 
Part B rebatable drugs that: (1) have the 
listed USP DC categories in Table 3 of 
this proposed rule; (2) are single source 
drugs or sole source biological products; 
(3) have a HCPCS Level II code with 
Medicare Part B FFS spending greater 
than $100 million over a 12-month 
period; and (4) are not excluded from 
the GLOBE Model as proposed in 42 
CFR 513.130(c). Based on the third 
criterion, CMS is excluding from the 
GLOBE Model those drugs with relative 
share of spending costs to drug 
spending lower than $100 million. This 
spending threshold applies to all

manufacturers irrespective of size. 
While lowering the spending threshold 
increases the number of drugs that 
could be included in the GLOBE Model, 
it also increases the number of small 
manufacturers that could potentially be 
impacted. For this reason, CMS 
proposes not to select a lower threshold. 
Further, increasing the threshold 
reduces both the number of small and 
large manufacturers and the number of 
drugs in the GLOBE Model. For 
example, a threshold of $125 million 
would exclude eight manufacturers 
including six large manufacturers (they 
employ more than 5,000 employees in 
the United States). Further, setting a 
threshold above $186 million would 
exclude all identified small 
manufacturers as well as 16 drugs 
manufactured by large manufacturers 
and would result in a total of 50 
included drugs. Selecting a different 
spending threshold higher than $100 
million would also reduce the estimated 
savings to the Medicare program and to 
beneficiaries and thereby shift the focus 
of the model test and limit the ability to 
evaluate the experiences of 
manufacturers of drugs with diverse 
characteristics. 
€Exempting small entities: As discussed in section II.B.2. of this 
proposed rule, to avoid interactions 
with other initiatives and programs that 
focus on manufacturers of Medicare Part 
B drugs, CMS would exclude drugs 
assigned to HCPCS Level II codes when 
the Medicare Part B payment limit is 
based on a maximum fair price for drugs 
separately payable under Medicare Part 
B. Because small and large 
manufacturers could potentially be 
eligible for this proposed exclusion, we 
do not believe that additional processes 
for exemptions are needed. CMS seeks 
comments on other factors or 
considerations regarding exemptions for 
small entities. 
€Compliance dates: CMS also considered the flexibility of providing 
different compliance dates to small 
manufacturers. While creating 
significantly different compliance dates 
could provide more time for small 
manufacturers to comply, it could 
interfere with the statutory requirement 
of evaluating the model to determine 
whether savings have occurred. 
In summary, because the purpose of 
the GLOBE Model is to test an 
innovative payment model that modifies 
the Medicare Part B inflation rebate 
amount calculation for GLOBE Model 
drugs using international drug pricing 
information to identify a benchmark 
that reflects prices paid in economically 
comparable countries, which CMS 
expects would reduce program 
expenditures for Medicare Part B while 
preserving or enhancing beneficiaries’ 
quality of care, CMS therefore declined 
to propose the alternatives considered. 
We welcome comments on the 
alternatives considered as well as other 
factors that could be considered to 
mitigate the impact on small 
manufacturers. 
F. Effects on Small Rural Hospitals 
Section 1102(b) of the Act requires 
CMS to prepare a regulatory impact 
analysis if a rule may have a significant 
impact on the operations of a substantial 
number of small rural hospitals. This 
analysis must conform to the provisions 
of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes 
of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define 
a small rural hospital as a hospital that 
is located outside of a metropolitan 
statistical area and has 100 or fewer 
beds. 
Providers and suppliers who furnish 
GLOBE Model drugs to Medicare FFS 
beneficiaries who are in the model 
cohort would not be GLOBE Model 
participants and would continue to buy 
and bill for GLOBE Model drugs as 
usual and receive separate payment 
under Medicare Part B if applicable. 
These providers and suppliers include 
hospital outpatient departments, 
physician practices, ambulatory surgical 
centers, pharmacies enrolled as durable 
medical equipment (DME) suppliers, 
and certain other provider and supplier 
types. When the GLOBE Model reduced 
beneficiary coinsurance applies, the 
portion of Medicare Part B allowed 
amount for a GLOBE Model drug paid 
by Medicare would be greater than the 
usual 80 percent. For example, if the 
Medicare Part B allowed amount under 
the GLOBE Model is $100 and the 
GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance 
percentage is 10 percent (instead of the 
usual 20 percent), the Medicare Part B 
program payment to the provider or 
supplier would be adjusted and would 
be $90 (instead of the usual $80) and the 
beneficiary financial responsibility 
would be $10. 
According to 2025 data from the 
American Hospital Association
163
there 
are 6,093 hospitals in the United States. 
Using data from 2021 and 2025, we 
estimate that there are 1,524 small rural 
hospitals in the United States.
164
This 
represents 25 percent of all U.S. 
hospitals. We estimate that very small 
rural hospitals, those with up to 25 
beds, represent almost 60 percent (or 
869) of all small rural hospitals, 
followed by hospitals with 25–50 beds 
(N=331) and 51–100 beds (N=323). It 
has been estimated that rural hospitals 
represent about 10.8 percent of the total 
share of Medicare Part B spending,
165
 
and that Medical Part B spending in all 
hospitals represented about 41 percent 
of total Part B spending in 2022 ($19.3 
billion/$46.9 billion).
166
Assuming that 
these percentages have remained 
relatively unchanged, we estimate that 
slightly less than 4 percent ($1.71 
billion) of total Medicare Part B drug 
allowed charges in 2024 are associated 
with very small rural providers and 
suppliers.
167
The small rural hospitals 
are not expected to experience drug 
payment reductions and overall 
payment reductions similar to urban 
hospitals. As noted previously, CMS 
anticipates that there would be some 
collaboration between manufacturers 
and providers to incentivize the 
increased use of white-bagging. 
However, small rural hospitals are not 
expected to experience increased use of 
white-bagging as for these facilities 
white-bagging may already be a 
reasonable solution.
168
We tentatively 
conclude that this proposed rule, if 
finalized as proposed, would not have a 
significant impact on small rural 
hospitals. We seek comments on this 
conclusion, as well as data or other 
factors that have not been considered. 
G. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
(UMRA) 
Section 202 of UMRA also requires 
that agencies assess anticipated costs 
and benefits before issuing any rule 
whose mandates require spending in 
any 1 year of $100 million in 1995 
dollars, updated annually for inflation.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260321 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules In 2025, that threshold is approximately 
$187 million. This proposed rule would 
not impose a mandate that would result 
in the expenditure by State, local, and 
Tribal Governments, in the aggregate, or 
by the private sector, of more than $187 
million in any one year. However, this 
proposed rule, if finalized as proposed, 
would result in additional impacts that 
we do not quantify associated with 
changes in behavior. We request 
comments, including on the potential 
magnitude of this impact and the extent 
to which it is a funded or unfunded 
mandate. 
H. Federalism 
Executive Order 13132 establishes 
certain requirements that an agency 
must meet when it promulgates a 
proposed rule that imposes substantial 
direct requirement costs on State and 
local governments, preempts State law, 
or otherwise has federalism 
implications. Since this proposed rule 
does not impose any substantial costs 
on State or local governments, preempt 
State law or have federalism 
implications, the requirements of 
Executive Order 13132 are not 
applicable. 
I. Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation 
E.O. 14192, titled ‘‘Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation,’’ was 
issued on January 31, 2025, and requires 
that ‘‘any new incremental costs 
associated with new regulations shall, to 
the extent permitted by law, be offset by 
the elimination of existing costs 
associated with at least 10 prior 
regulations.’’ 
V. Response to Comments 
Because of the large number of public 
comments we normally receive on 
documents, we are not able to 
acknowledge or respond to them 
individually. We will consider all 
comments we receive by the date and 
time specified in the 
DATESsection of 
this preamble, and, when we proceed 
with a subsequent document, we will 
respond to the comments in the

to administrative or judicial review. 
§ 513.110 GLOBE Model geographic areas. 
(a) Identification of GLOBE Model geographic areas. 
The GLOBE Model geographic areas 
are identified by ZIP Codes in the 
United States, excluding U.S. territories 
that are aligned with ZCTAs that are 
randomly selected by CMS no later than 
60 calendar days prior to the start of the 
model performance period. During the 
model performance period, if a ZIP 
Code that is within the GLOBE Model 
geographic areas is split or redesignated, 
the new ZIP Code is not get reassigned 
to a GLOBE Model geographic area. 
(b) Selection process. (1) The identified geographic areas are selected 
randomly based on the total Medicare 
population and expenditures, including 
Part B drug expenditures balanced on 
Medicare beneficiary population and 
Medicare expenditures nationwide. 
(2) The identified GLOBE Model 
geographic areas must include ZIP 
Codes where approximately 25 percent 
of Medicare Part B FFS beneficiaries 
have an address of record as set forth in 
42 CFR 513.120. 
(c) No later than 30 calendar days in 
advance of model start, CMS provides a 
table on the GLOBE Model website that 
lists the GLOBE model geographic areas 
by ZIP code. 
§ 513.120 Identification of GLOBE Model 
beneficiaries and comparison group. 
(a) General. (1) The identification of GLOBE Model eligible beneficiaries and 
the comparison group is performed 
solely by CMS at certain points in time 
as determined by CMS and is not 
subject to review. 
(2) CMS determines when the list of 
GLOBE Model eligible beneficiaries is 
created and updated, and the Medicare 
claims processing systems are updated 
with the most recent list of GLOBE 
Model eligible beneficiaries, the timing 
of such updates is not subject to review. 
(3) For purposes of identifying a 
beneficiary’s address in paragraph (b), 
CMS uses the beneficiary’s address as 
recorded in CMS’s Medicare Beneficiary 
Database (MBD), System No. 09–70– 
0536, as determined by CMS. 
(b) Initial assignment of beneficiaries as eligible for the Model cohort or 
comparison group. Subject to paragraph 
(d) of this section, approximately 30 
days prior to model start using available 
Medicare program administrative 
information as determined by CMS, 
CMS— 
(1) Identifies the Medicare 
beneficiaries who are enrolled in 
Medicare Part B, have Traditional 
Medicare Part B as their primary payer, 
and have an address of record within 
the GLOBE Model geographic areas 
selected for inclusion in the model at 
model start (as identified by CMS under 
42 CFR 513.110(c)), and adds such 
beneficiaries to the GLOBE Model 
Eligible Beneficiary List. 
(2) Identifies Medicare beneficiaries 
who are enrolled in Medicare Part B, 
have Traditional Medicare Part B as 
their primary payer, and do not have an 
address of record within the GLOBE 
Model geographic areas selected for 
inclusion in the model, and assigns 
such beneficiaries as eligible for the 
comparison group. 
(c) GLOBE Model Eligible Beneficiary List Updates. Subject to paragraph (d) of 
this section, periodically (not more 
frequently than weekly), using available 
Medicare program administrative 
information as determined by CMS, 
CMS identifies the Medicare 
beneficiaries— 
(1) Who are enrolled in Medicare Part 
B, have Traditional Medicare Part B as 
their primary payer, and have an 
address of record within the GLOBE 
Model geographic areas selected for 
inclusion (as identified by CMS under 
42 CFR 513.110(c)), are not yet included 
on the GLOBE Model Eligible 
Beneficiary List, and are not assigned as 
eligible for the comparison group. CMS 
adds such beneficiaries to the GLOBE 
Model Eligible Beneficiary List at the 
next cohort update; and 
(2) On the GLOBE Model Eligible 
Beneficiary List who no longer meet the 
criteria for a GLOBE Model eligible 
beneficiary and removes such 
beneficiaries from the GLOBE Model 
Eligible Beneficiary List at the next 
update. 
(d) Beneficiary exclusions. Subject to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the 
following are not eligible for assignment 
to the GLOBE Model Eligible 
Beneficiary List or comparison group: 
(1) Beneficiaries who do not have 
Medicare Part B FFS as their primary 
payer; and 
(2) Beneficiaries who are enrolled in 
a MA plan, section 1876 cost plan, 
section 1833 healthcare prepayment 
plans, or who have other group health 
coverage that is a primary payer (such 
as employer-sponsored health 
insurance). 
(3) Beneficiaries who are identified by 
CMS as eligible for inclusion in the 
comparison group prior to model start 
remain eligible for the comparison 
group as determined by CMS. 
(e) GLOBE Model Beneficiaries. GLOBE Model eligible beneficiaries who 
are furnished a GLOBE Model drug 
during the model performance period 
for which separate payment is made are 
GLOBE Model beneficiaries as 
determined by CMS. 
§ 513.130 GLOBE Model drugs and 
excluded drugs. 
(a) [Reserved.] 
(b) GLOBE Model drugs. GLOBE Model drugs include Part B rebatable 
drugs (as identified by the applicable 
billing and payment code) in 
accordance with 42 CFR 
427.101(a)(1)(ii) of this chapter that 
meet the following criteria:

as antigout agents, antineoplastics, 
blood products and modifiers, central 
nervous system agents, immunological 
agents, metabolic bone disease agents, 
or ophthalmic agents as specified in the 
United States Pharmacopeia Drug 
Classification (USP DC) category. 
(i) CMS identifies drugs or biological 
products that are Part B rebatable drugs 
at the start of the GLOBE Model as 
antigout agents, antineoplastics, blood 
products and modifiers, central nervous 
system agents, immunological agents, 
metabolic bone disease agents, or 
ophthalmic agents using the United 
States Pharmacopeia Drug Classification 
published in 2025 (USP DC 2025). 
(ii) CMS identifies drugs or biological 
products that were not Part B rebatable 
drugs at the start of the GLOBE Model, 
but subsequently become Part B 
rebatable drugs, as antigout agents, 
antineoplastics, blood products and 
modifiers, central nervous system 
agents, immunological agents, metabolic 
bone disease agents, or ophthalmic 
agents identified using the latest, 
publicly available United States 
Pharmacopeia Drug Classification to 
identify their category. 
(iii) CMS adds new USP DC categories 
that stem from the USP DC categories 
listed in § 513.130(b)(1) to the GLOBE 
Model inclusion criteria. CMS may 
make this determination based on a 
review of USP revision bulletins, 
revision histories, and corresponding 
change log information published by 
USP. 
(2) Single source drugs or sole source 
biological products. 
(3) Drug or biological products with 
total Medicare Part B FFS allowed 
charges greater than $100 million over 
a 12-month period (as determined by 
CMS under paragraph (d) of this 
section) ending 6 months prior to the 
start of the applicable calendar quarter. 
(i) This criterion is met if the drug or 
biological product meets this 
requirement (as determined by CMS 
under paragraph (d) of this section) at 
least one time during the duration of the 
GLOBE Model. If the drug or biological 
product meets this criterion for an 
applicable calendar quarter it continues 
to meet this criterion for subsequent 
applicable calendar quarters even if the 
Medicare Part B FFS allowed charges 
falls below $100 million over a 12- 
month period ending 6 months prior to 
the start of the subsequent applicable 
calendar quarters. 
(4) Drug or biological products that 
are not excluded from the GLOBE 
Model under paragraph (c) of this 
section. 
(c) Exclusions. (1) The following are excluded from the GLOBE Model: 
(i) A Part B rebatable drug for 
applicable calendar quarters prior to the 
first applicable calendar quarter for 
which CMS identifies a specified 
amount under 42 CFR 427.302(b). 
(ii) A Part B rebatable drug for which 
a maximum fair price under the 
Medicare Drug Price Negotiation 
Program is in effect. 
(iii) A drug or biological product that 
is no longer a Part B rebatable drug 
during the duration of the GLOBE 
Model is removed for the applicable 
calendar quarter in which it is no longer 
a Part B rebatable drug. 
(d) Medicare Part B FFS allowed charges. For a GLOBE Model drug for an applicable calendar quarter, CMS 
calculates the total Medicare Part B FFS 
allowed charges for a consecutive 12- 
month period ending 6 months prior to 
the start of the applicable calendar 
quarter as follows: 
(1) CMS identifies the Medicare Part 
B FFS final action claims with dates of 
service within the consecutive 12- 
month period ending 6 months prior to 
the start of the applicable calendar 
quarter that have separately payable 
allowed charges greater than $0 for any 
billing and payment code used to 
describe the GLOBE Model drug. 
(2) For the claims identified in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, CMS 
sums the allowed charges. 
(e) GLOBE Model Drug HCPCS Level II Codes List. (1) Subject to paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, prior to an 
applicable calendar quarter, CMS 
creates the GLOBE Model Drug HCPCS 
Level II Codes List for that applicable 
calendar quarter as follows: 
(i) CMS adds all separately payable 
HCPCS Level II codes for a GLOBE 
Model drug identified in accordance 
with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section to the GLOBE Model Drug 
HCPCS Level II Codes List for that 
applicable calendar quarter. 
(ii) CMS identifies a United States 
Pharmacopeia Drug Classification 
Category for each HCPCS Level II code. 
(A) HCPCS Level II codes included in 
the initial GLOBE Model Drug HCPCS 
Level II Codes List retain their USP DC 
category for the entire model duration. 
(B) New HCPCS Level II codes that 
were not in the previously published 
GLOBE Model Drug HCPCS Level II 
Codes List is assigned a United States 
Pharmacopeia Drug Classification 
category at the time of identification of 
the new HCPCS Level II codes for a 
GLOBE Model drug, based on the 
United States Pharmacopeia Drug 
Classification available then. After 
identification, the new HCPCS Level II 
codes retain their category for the 
remainder of the model duration. 
(2) Revisions. As applicable, CMS revises the GLOBE Model Drug HCPCS 
Level II Codes List for an applicable 
calendar quarter to correct errors as 
determined by CMS. 
(3) Publication. CMS makes the GLOBE Model Drug HCPCS Level II 
Codes List for an applicable calendar 
quarter available on the CMS GLOBE 
Model website. 
Subpart C—Coinsurance Adjustment 
and Adjusted Medicare Payment for 
GLOBE Model Drugs 
§ 513.200 Definitions. 
As used in this subpart, the following 
definitions apply: 
GLOBE Model beneficiary 
coinsurance percentage means the 
applicable coinsurance percentage as 
determined under this subpart. 
Per unit GLOBE Model benchmark 
amount means the sum of the product of the per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark as set forth in 42 CFR 
513.400, the applicable threshold 
percentage, and the add-on percentage 
amount as set forth in 42 CFR 
513.400(c). 
§ 513.210 Computation of GLOBE Model 
beneficiary coinsurance adjustment and 
adjusted Medicare payment for GLOBE 
Model drugs. 
(a) General. CMS uses the methodology set forth in this section to 
calculate the GLOBE Model beneficiary 
coinsurance, the GLOBE Model 
beneficiary coinsurance percentage and 
associated adjusted Medicare payment 
for GLOBE Model drugs. 
(b) Calculation of GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance adjustment. To 
calculate and determine if the GLOBE 
Model beneficiary coinsurance 
adjustment applies for separately 
payable units of GLOBE Model drugs 
furnished to a GLOBE Model beneficiary 
with respect to an applicable calendar 
quarter, CMS compares the payment 
amount as set forth in 42 CFR 
427.201(b)(3) to the per unit GLOBE 
Model benchmark amount as set forth in 
42 CFR 513.400. 
(1) If the payment amount exceeds the 
per unit GLOBE Model benchmark 
amount, the GLOBE Model beneficiary 
coinsurance adjustment applies and the 
GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance 
is calculated by multiplying the per unit 
GLOBE Model benchmark amount by 
0.20. In such case, the GLOBE Model 
beneficiary coinsurance is applied as a 
percent to the payment amount and the 
GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance 
percentage is calculated by dividing the 
GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance

the third decimal place. 
(2) If the payment amount does not 
exceed the per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark amount, the adjustment to 
the beneficiary coinsurance set forth in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not 
applied. In such case, the GLOBE Model 
beneficiary coinsurance is the 
coinsurance amount computed as set 
forth in 42 CFR 419.41(e) or 42 CFR 
489.30(b)(1) as applicable. 
(c) Identification of the adjusted Medicare payment amount. When the 
GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance 
adjustment applies, CMS calculates the 
adjusted Medicare payment amount for 
a GLOBE Model drug for an applicable 
calendar quarter as follows. 
(1) Calculation of the adjusted Medicare payment amount. The product 
of the allowed amount multiplied by the 
GLOBE Model beneficiary coinsurance 
percentage is subtracted from the 
allowed amount. Subject to paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, the result equals 
the adjusted Medicare payment amount. 
(2) Limitation. The adjusted Medicare 
payment amount is subject to other 
claims adjustments and the Part B 
deductible. 
(d) Exclusions. Any Part B rebatable drug that is excluded from the GLOBE 
Model for an applicable calendar 
quarter is not subject to the GLOBE 
Model beneficiary coinsurance 
adjustment set forth in paragraph (b) of 
this section and the adjusted Medicare 
payment amount set forth in paragraph 
(c) of this section.

60 percent of the U.S. real GDP per 
capita and an annual real GDP of at least 
$400 billion, as determined by CMS in 
accordance with this paragraph (b). 
(2) Subject to the limitation specified 
in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the 
real GDP per capita for a country is the 
most recent estimate of real GDP per 
capita based on purchasing power parity 
for that country for the year 2024 using 
data available in the U.S. Central 
Intelligence Agency (CIA) World 
Factbook as of October 1, 2025. 
(3) Subject to the limitation specified 
in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the 
annual real GDP for a country is the 
most recent estimate of annual real GDP 
based on purchasing power parity for 
that country for the year 2024 available 
in the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency 
(CIA) World Factbook as of October 1, 
2025. 
(4) The country’s real GDP per capita 
and annual real GDP, and the U.S. real 
GDP per capita selected from the CIA 
World Factbook must be for the same 
calendar year and for the year 2024. 
(5) CMS identifies countries with a 
real GDP per capita that is at least 60 
percent of the U.S. GDP per capita by 
dividing the real GDP per capita for a 
country by the U.S. real GDP per capita 
and assessing the results. 
(6) CMS identifies the set of reference 
countries for the GLOBE Model 
performance period prior to the start of 
performance year 1 using the U.S. CIA

(1) General. For purposes of selecting a data source for each GLOBE Model 
drug for an applicable calendar quarter 
for a reference country, CMS identifies 
available international drug pricing 
information data sources for the GLOBE 
Model drug, by aligning the GLOBE 
Model drug’s assigned HCPCS Level II 
code long description (including dosage 
form) with the data sources’ 
standardized method for identifying 
scientific names or nonproprietary 
names, dosage form, route of 
administration, other details within the 
billing and payment code long 
description, as applicable. 
(i) CMS obtains data from one or more 
international drug pricing information 
data sources for purposes of identifying 
available international drug pricing 
information for the countries specified 
in paragraph (b) of this section. 
(ii) The data sources must, as 
determined by CMS use a standardized

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260327 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules number of items, packages or units 
sold). 
(B) Sales data, which may be based on 
ex-manufacturer prices (sometimes 
called ex-factory prices) that represent 
actual or calculated prices paid to the 
manufacturer by wholesalers and other 
distributors across countries within the 
data source (expressed in U.S. currency) 
and its corresponding volume, meaning 
quantity of units (for example, number 
of items, packages or units sold). 
(C) Retail prices that represent actual 
or calculated sales for retail purchasers, 
or prices paid by other purchasers in the 
distribution channels across countries 
within the data source (expressed in 
U.S. currency and its corresponding 
volume data, meaning quantity of units 
(for example, number of items, packages 
or units sold). 
(D) List prices across countries within 
the data source (expressed in U.S. 
currency). 
(E) Sales data, which may be based on 
ex-manufacturer prices (sometimes

(v) Have mechanisms in place to 
maintain, update, validate, and correct, 
if necessary, the information on 
international drug pricing in the data 
source on at least a quarterly basis. 
(vi) Be maintained by an organization 
that seeks to limit the lag inherent in 
data to no more than 90 days from the 
end of the calendar quarter for which 
drug pricing information is compiled to 
the time that the organization makes 
updates available to users of the data 
source. 
(2) Selection of data source. Subject to paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3) of this 
section, for each GLOBE Model drug for 
an applicable calendar quarter, CMS 
selects a data source using the following 
hierarchy and uses this data source, if 
available, to identify the per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark as 
described in 42 CFR 513.400(b). 
(i) The data source contains drug 
specific sales and volume data for the 
applicable ASP calendar quarter from at 
least one country described in 
paragraph (b) of this section. 
(ii) Except as noted in paragraph 
(c)(2)(iii) of this section, the data source 
does not have drug specific sales and 
volume data for the applicable ASP 
calendar quarter, but contains drug 
specific sales and volume data for any 
prior ASP calendar quarter beginning on 
or after April 1, 2025 from at least one 
country described in paragraph (b) of 
this section. If sales and volume data 
from a prior ASP calendar quarter are 
used, CMS uses sales and volume data 
from the most recent ASP calendar 
quarter for which both sales and volume 
data are available. 
(iii) The extracted data used by CMS 
to identify the most recent per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark 
available in a document posted on the 
GLOBE Model website, including 
extracted data with drug specific sales 
and volume data from January 1, 2024 
to December 31, 2024 from at least one 
country described in paragraph (b) of 
this section. 
(iv) The data source contains drug 
specific ex-manufacturer price data for 
the applicable ASP calendar quarter 
from at least one country described in 
paragraph (b) of this section. 
(v) The data source contains drug 
specific list price data (for example, the 
price made available to wholesalers) for 
the applicable ASP calendar quarter 
from at least one country described in 
paragraph (b) of this section. 
(3) If there is more than one data 
source for a GLOBE Model drug, CMS 
selects the data source at the highest 
level of the hierarchy that contains 
information from the highest number of 
countries described in paragraph (b) of 
this section and, if available, 
incorporates discounts, rebates, and 
other price concessions into its drug 
pricing information. CMS does not use 
more than one data source for a GLOBE 
drug across countries. 
(d) Identification of available manufacturer-submitted international 
net pricing information used to identify 
the per unit Method II GLOBE Model 
benchmark. 
(1) General. Subject to 42 CFR 513.610 and the GLOBE Model data 
agreement (42 CFR 513.620), for each 
GLOBE Model drug for an applicable 
calendar quarter as set forth in 42 CFR 
513.20, CMS assesses manufacturer- 
submitted international net pricing 
information for the applicable ASP 
calendar quarter that was accepted in 
accordance with 42 CFR 513.610. 
(2) Determining availability of international net pricing information. 
For purposes of identifying available 
manufacturer-submitted international 
drug pricing information for the 
countries specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section for a GLOBE Model drug for 
an applicable calendar quarter, CMS 
uses the following steps: 
(i) CMS identifies the accepted 
manufacturer-submitted international 
net pricing information for the 
applicable ASP calendar quarter (as set 
forth in 42 CFR 513.20) that aligns with 
a GLOBE Model drug’s HCPCS Level II 
code long descriptor (including 
scientific or nonproprietary name, 
dosage form, route of administration (if 
applicable), and other details within the 
billing and payment code long 
description), as determined by CMS. 
(ii) When there is accepted 
international net pricing information 
(or, if applicable, an attestation stating 
that there was no reportable 
international net pricing information) 
from each eligible manufacturer of the 
GLOBE Model drug, using the accepted 
international net pricing information 
identified in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of 
this section, CMS identifies presentation 
level information that includes, as 
determined by CMS— 
(A) Complete international drug 
product information that is consistent 
with the reported total quantity of drug 
in the pack size; 
(B) International net pricing and sales 
data for at least one of the countries 
specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section; and 
(C) The presentation level information 
is not for an international generic or 
international biosimilar biological 
product (as applicable for data for a 
country). 
(iii) CMS deems the presentation level 
information to be complete and valid 
per 42 CFR 513.610. 
(3) Limitation. If CMS determines that manufacturer-submitted international 
drug pricing information is not 
complete and valid per 42 CFR 513.610, 
then the presentation level information 
is not available for purposes of 42 CFR 
513.520. 
Subpart E—Determination of the Per 
Unit GLOBE Benchmark Amount 
§ 513.400 Identification of the per unit 
GLOBE Model benchmark amount. 
(a) General. The result of calculations in this subpart E are rounded to the fifth 
decimal place except for the calculation 
in paragraph (c)(4) which are rounded to 
the third decimal place. 
(b) Identification of the per unit GLOBE Model benchmark. Subject to 
available information as determined by 
CMS and paragraph (b)(3), for each 
applicable calendar quarter, CMS 
identifies and designates the greater of 
the following as the per unit GLOBE 
Model benchmark: 
(1) The per unit Method I GLOBE

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260328 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules (2) The per unit Method II GLOBE 
Model benchmark (as determined in 42 
CFR 513.420), as available, as the per 
unit GLOBE Model benchmark for a 
GLOBE Model drug for the applicable 
calendar quarter. 
(3) Limitation. If CMS determines that neither a per unit Method I GLOBE 
Model benchmark nor a per unit 
Method II GLOBE Model benchmark is 
available, CMS identifies that the per 
unit GLOBE Model benchmark for the 
GLOBE Model drug for the applicable 
calendar quarter is not available. 
(c) Calculation of the per unit GLOBE Model benchmark amount. For each 
applicable calendar quarter, for a 
GLOBE Model drug, when a per unit 
GLOBE Model benchmark is available as 
set forth in paragraph (b), CMS 
calculates the per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark amount as follows: 
(1) CMS multiplies the per unit 
GLOBE Model benchmark by the 
applicable threshold percentage as set 
forth in 42 CFR 513.400(d). 
(2) CMS calculates add-on percentage 
amount which is the dollar value of the 
add-on percentage included in the 
Medicare Part B payment limit for the 
HCPCS Level II code for the GLOBE 
Model drug as specified under section 
1847A(b) of the Act for the applicable 
calendar quarter. In general, the 
Medicare Part B payment limit is equal 
to the specified amount (as defined at 42 
CFR 427.302(b). 
(3) CMS sums the amounts calculated 
in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this 
section. 
(4) CMS rounds the amount 
calculated in paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section to the third decimal place and 
identifies this amount as the per unit 
GLOBE Model benchmark amount. 
(d) Applicable threshold percentage. When the per unit GLOBE Model 
benchmark is based on the per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark, the 
applicable threshold percentage is 102 
percent. When the per unit GLOBE 
Model benchmark is based on the per 
unit Method II GLOBE Model 
benchmark, the applicable threshold 
percentage is 105 percent. 
§ 513.410 Identification of the per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark. 
For each GLOBE Model drug, CMS 
identifies the per unit Method I GLOBE 
Model benchmark by identifying the 
lowest per unit GDP (PPP) adjusted 
country-level price using available 
international drug pricing information 
from available data sources, in 
accordance with 42 CFR 513.310, as 
determined by CMS, and the 
methodology described in this section. 
(a) Per unit country-level price. CMS identifies the per unit country-level 
price for each country specified in 42 
CFR 513.310(b), as available, using the 
following steps: 
(1) Identify available international drug pricing data. By country, using the 
data source selected in accordance with 
42 CFR 513.310(c)(2), CMS identifies 
available international drug pricing data 
for the GLOBE Model drug, for the 
applicable ASP calendar quarter for the 
first applicable calendar quarter that the 
drug is a GLOBE Model drug, by 
aligning the GLOBE Model drug’s 
HCPCS Level II code long description 
(including scientific or nonproprietary 
name, dosage form, route of 
administration (if applicable), and other 
details within the billing and payment 
code long description, as applicable) 
with the data sources’ standardized 
method for identifying scientific names 
or nonproprietary names, dosage form, 
and route of administration (if 
applicable), as applicable. CMS extracts 
available drug pricing data for the 
countries specified in 42 CFR 513.310(b) 
from the selected international drug 
pricing information data sources that, as 
determined by CMS— 
(i) Represent the price of a U.S. 
originator drug or international 
originator drug (as applicable for data 
for a country); 
(ii) Have complete package size 
information; 
(iii) Represent scientific or 
nonproprietary name and dosage form 
and include route of administration (if 
applicable), that could be described by 
the GLOBE Model drug’s HCPCS Level 
II code descriptor; and 
(iv) Have strength data. 
(2) Apply data checks. As determined by CMS, CMS applies the following 
steps as applicable: 
(i) Identify and discard extracted data 
as follows: 
(A) When international drug pricing 
information with sales and volume data 
are available, CMS excludes 
international drug pricing data without 
both sales and volume data that are 
greater than zero. 
(B) [Reserved.] 
(ii) When the product information (for 
example, product strength or package 
size) is inconsistent or not verifiable 
with available product information such 
as product labeling or product approval 
information for the GLOBE Model 
drug’s HCPCS Level II code descriptor. 
(3) Convert volume data to unit of measurement delineated in the HCPCS 
Level II Code descriptor. CMS converts 
the volume data to the unit of 
measurement delineated in the GLOBE 
Model drug’s HCPCS Code Level II 
descriptor, as applicable. 
(i) CMS adjusts the volume data, as 
applicable, before converting the 
volume data unit of measurement 
delineated in the GLOBE Model drug’s 
HCPCS Level II code descriptor when 
the data source shows the package size 
or a presentation level (dosage form or 
route of administration (if applicable)) 
that is inconsistent with the 
manufacturer’s information about that 
product for the GLOBE Model drug’s 
HCPCS Level II code descriptor, as 
determined by CMS. 
(ii) CMS limits the number of HCPCS 
billing units when— 
(A) The available information (such as 
package labeling) indicates a limited 
quantity of drug is to be used from the 
presentation level; and 
(B) The HCPCS dosage is per dose. 
(4) Calculate the per unit country- level price for the GLOBE Model drug by 
country. Using the international drug pricing information extracted and 
adjusted in accordance with paragraphs 
(3)(i) and (3)(ii) of this section, 
respectively, CMS calculates the per 
unit country-level price for the 
international drug by country for each 
country specified in 42 CFR 513.310(b) 
for which international drug pricing 
information is available, using the 
calculation that is applicable. 
(i) If an international drug pricing 
information data source with sales and 
volume data is used, the applicable 
calculation is as follows: 
(A) CMS removes pricing information 
at the dosage form and strength level for 
a country that falls below 5 percent of 
the average price in the U.S. as set forth 
in paragraph (d) of this section. 
(B) Using remaining data, CMS sums 
the adjusted volume data (as specified 
in paragraph (3) of this section) for the 
presentation levels of the applicable 
international analog (as specified in 42 
CFR 513.600). 
(C) Using remaining data, CMS sums 
the total sales for the presentation levels 
for the applicable international analog 
(as specified in 42 CFR 513.600) (that 
remain after performing the data 
checks). 
(D) CMS divides the sum determined 
in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(C) of this section 
by the sum determined in paragraph 
(a)(4)(i)(B) of this section, resulting in an 
average price per unit, where the unit is 
the same unit delineated in the HCPCS 
Level II code descriptor. 
(ii) If an international drug pricing 
information data source with ex- 
manufacturer or list prices is used, the 
applicable calculation is as follows: 
(A) For each extracted ex- 
manufacturer or list price, CMS

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260329 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules calculates the number of HCPCS billing 
units in the presentation level by 
dividing the quantity of drug in the 
presentation level by the quantity of 
drug represented in the HCPCS dosage 
from the HCPCS Level II code 
descriptor. 
(B) CMS divides the ex-manufacturer 
or list price, as applicable, by the 
number of HCPCS billing units in the 
presentation level (as calculated in 
paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A) of this section), 
resulting in a price per unit where the 
unit is the same unit delineated in the 
HCPCS Level II code descriptor. 
(C) CMS removes pricing information 
at the dosage form and strength level for 
a country that falls below 5 percent of 
the average price in the U.S. as set forth 
in paragraph (d) of this section. 
(D) CMS calculates the sum of the 
price per (as calculated in paragraph 
(a)(4)(ii) (B) of this section) for each ex- 
manufacturer or list price that was 
identified as available as set forth in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section and not 
removed as set forth in paragraph 
(a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section. 
(E) CMS divides the sum calculated in 
paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(D) of this section by 
the number of ex-manufacturer or list 
prices that were identified as available 
as set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section and not removed as set forth in 
paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(C) of this section, 
resulting in an average price per unit 
where the unit is the same unit 
delineated in the HCPCS Level II code 
descriptor. 
(iii) CMS performs the applicable 
calculation for each country specified in 
42 CFR 513.310(b) for which 
international drug pricing information is 
available in the selected data source. 
(b) Per unit GDP (PPP) adjusted country-level price for the GLOBE Model 
drug by country. CMS applies the 
applicable GDP (PPP) adjuster for the 
applicable ASP calendar quarter as 
identified 42 CFR 513.430 to each per 
unit country-level price identified as set 
forth in paragraph (a)(4) of this section 
to calculate the per unit GDP (PPP) 
adjusted country-level price by 
multiplying each per unit country-level 
price by the applicable GDP (PPP) 
adjuster for such country and rounds 
the result at the fifth decimal place. 
(c) Per unit Method I GLOBE Model benchmark. (1) CMS identifies the lowest per unit GDP (PPP) adjusted 
country-level price for the international 
drug calculated in paragraph (b) of this 
section to the third decimal place and 
identifies the result as the per unit 
Method I GLOBE Model benchmark. 
(2) For each Part B rebatable drug that 
becomes a GLOBE Model drug during 
the model performance period, CMS 
identifies the per unit Method I GLOBE 
Model benchmark for the first 
applicable calendar quarter for which 
the drug is a GLOBE Model drug and 
this benchmark remains in place for 
each applicable calendar quarter 
thereafter until the end of the model 
performance period. 
(d) Average U.S. price. (1) Subject to paragraph (d)(2), when there is 
international pricing information 
available as set forth in 42 CFR 
513.410(a), CMS identifies the average 
U.S. drug price using the same pricing 
information from the selected data 
source used for the reference country for 
the applicable ASP calendar quarter. 
(2) If the selected data source for the 
reference country does not contain 
available U.S. pricing information, to 
identify the average U.S. price CMS uses 
the most recently published Medicare 
Part B payment limit minus the add-on 
amount for the HCPCS Level II code for 
the GLOBE Model drug for the calendar 
quarter before the applicable ASP 
calendar quarter. 
§ 513.420 Identification of the per unit 
Method II GLOBE Model benchmark. 
For each applicable calendar quarter, 
when there is an applicable submission 
as set forth in 42 CFR 513.610(a) for a 
GLOBE Model drug, CMS identifies the 
per unit Method II GLOBE Model 
benchmark using available 
manufacturer-submitted international 
drug net pricing data for the applicable 
ASP calendar quarter, as identified by 
CMS in accordance with 42 CFR 513.20, 
and the methodology described in this 
section. 
(a) Identify available across country volume-weighted average GDP (PPP) 
adjusted net price per HCPCS billing 
unit in U.S. dollars. For the GLOBE 
Model drug, within each applicable 
submission for the applicable calendar 
quarter, CMS identifies the across 
country volume-weighted average GDP 
(PPP) adjusted net price per HCPCS 
billing unit where, using the basic data 
elements, the scientific or 
nonproprietary name, dosage form, 
route of administration (if applicable), 
and other details within the billing and 
payment code long description, as 
applicable, align with the HCPCS Level 
II code long descriptor for the GLOBE 
Model drug. 
(b) Identify the per unit Method II GLOBE Model benchmark based on 
number of manufacturer submissions. 
Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, 
CMS identifies the per unit Method II 
GLOBE Model benchmark using the 
applicable steps as follows: 
(1) When there is one manufacturer submission. CMS identifies the across country volume-weighted average GDP 
(PPP) adjusted net price per HCPCS 
billing unit data element as the per unit 
Method II GLOBE Model benchmark for 
the applicable calendar quarter. 
(2) When there is more than one manufacturer submission. CMS 
calculates a volume-weighted average 
using data across all of the applicable 
submissions using the following steps: 
(i) Separately, for each applicable 
submission, CMS multiplies the across 
country volume-weighted average GDP 
(PPP) adjusted net price per HCPCS 
billing unit by the sum of the volume in 
billing units. 
(ii) CMS sums the amounts calculated 
in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. 
(iii) CMS calculates the total volume 
by summing the billing units across all 
applicable submissions. 
(iv) CMS divides the sum calculated 
in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) by the total 
volume calculated in paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section. 
(v) The resulting volume-weighted 
average is rounded at the third decimal 
place and is identified as the per unit 
Method II GLOBE Model benchmark for 
the applicable calendar quarter. 
(c) Unavailable net pricing data. When a manufacturer submission for an 
applicable calendar quarter as set forth 
in § 513.20 is either not accepted by 
CMS as set forth in § 513.610 or was not 
submitted by all manufacturers of the 
GLOBE Model drug, CMS identifies that 
the per unit Method II GLOBE Model 
benchmark is unavailable for such 
applicable calendar quarter. 
§ 513.430 Calculation of the GDP (PPP) 
adjuster. 
(a) GDP (PPP) adjuster formula. Subject to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of 
this section, for a country, CMS 
calculates the GDP (PPP) adjuster by 
dividing the U.S. GDP (PPP) per capita 
by the country’s GDP (PPP) per capita 
and rounds the result at the third 
decimal place. 
(b) Data used. Subject to the limitations specified in paragraphs (c) 
and (d) of this section, the GDP (PPP) 
per capita for a country is the most 
recent estimate of GDP per capita based 
on purchasing power parity for that 
country available in the CIA World 
Factbook at the start of the applicable 
ASP calendar quarter, as determined by 
CMS. 
(c) Limitations. (1) The country’s GDP (PPP) per capita and U.S. GDP (PPP) per 
capita must be for the same year. 
(2) The GDP (PPP) per capita used 
must be for the same year as the data 
used to calculate the unadjusted per 
unit country-level price, if available, or 
the most recent earlier year available.

GDP (PPP) adjuster is set to 1.000. 
Subpart F—Determination of the total 
GLOBE Model Rebate Amount for 
GLOBE Model Drugs 
§ 513.500 Calculation of the total GLOBE 
Model rebate amount and incremental 
GLOBE Model rebate amount due. 
(a) Total GLOBE Model rebate amount. The total GLOBE Model rebate amount for a GLOBE Model drug for an 
applicable calendar quarter is equal to 
the product of the per unit GLOBE 
Model rebate amount of such drug, as 
determined under § 513.520(a), and the 
total number of GLOBE Model billing 
units, as identified by CMS as set forth 
in § 513.520. 
(b) Incremental GLOBE Model rebate amount. The incremental GLOBE Model rebate amount for a GLOBE Model drug 
for an applicable calendar quarter is 
equal to the product of the incremental 
per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount of 
such drug, as determined under 
§ 513.510(b), and the total number of 
GLOBE Model billing units, as 
identified by CMS as set forth in 
§ 513.520. 
(c) Apportionment of the incremental GLOBE Model rebate amount. When 
there is more than one manufacturer for 
a GLOBE Model drug for an applicable 
calendar quarter, CMS uses the 
proportion of manufacturer-reported 
ASP units as calculated by CMS in 
accordance with 42 CFR 427.301(b) or 
(c) and reported by CMS in the Rebate 
Reports specified in 42 CFR 427.501 for 
a manufacturer to apportion the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount to such manufacturer. 
(d) Reducing the incremental GLOBE Model rebate amount for GLOBE Model 
drugs currently in shortage. (1) For an 
applicable calendar quarter when the 
total rebate amount determined under 
42 CFR 427.301(a) is reduced as 
specified in 42 CFR 427.401, the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount calculated in paragraph (c) of 
this section, if any is owed, is reduced 
using the following formula: 
Equation 1 to Paragraph (c)(1) 
Reduced incremental GLOBE Model 
rebate amount = the incremental GLOBE 
Model rebate amount multiplied by (1 
minus ‘‘applicable percent reduction’’ determined under 42 CFR 427.401(b)(2) 
multiplied by (‘‘percentage of time drug 
was currently in shortage during the 
applicable calendar quarter’’ as 
determined in accordance with 42 CFR 
427.401(b)(3)) added to the incremental 
GLOBE Model rebate amount multiplied 
by (1 minus ‘‘percentage of time drug was currently in shortage during the 
applicable calendar quarter’’ as 
determined in accordance with 42 CFR 
427.401(b)(3)). 
(2) CMS applies a reduction of the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount determined in paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section to all the NDCs under the 
relevant billing and payment code as 
specified in 42 CFR 427.401(c). 
(e) Reducing the incremental GLOBE Model rebate amount for GLOBE Model 
biosimilar biological products when 
there is a severe supply chain 
disruption. When CMS reduces the total rebate amount determined under 42 
CFR 427.301(a), if any is owed, for a 
Part B rebatable biosimilar biological 
product that is a GLOBE Model drug for 
an applicable quarter, CMS reduces the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount determined in paragraph (c) of 
this section for such GLOBE Model 
drug, if any is owed, using the same 
percentage reduction that CMS applied 
under 42 CFR 427.402 for such GLOBE 
Model drug for the applicable calendar 
quarter. 
(f) Other considerations for calculating the total GLOBE Model 
rebate amount and the incremental 
GLOBE Model rebate amount. The 
amounts calculated in paragraphs (a) 
through (e) of this section are rounded 
to the third decimal place. 
§ 513.510 Calculation of the per unit 
GLOBE Model rebate amount and 
incremental per unit GLOBE Model rebate 
amount. 
(a) Calculate the per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount. (1) Subject to 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to 
calculate the per unit GLOBE Model 
rebate amount for a GLOBE Model drug 
for an applicable calendar quarter, CMS 
identifies the greater of the amounts 
specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) 
of this section and rounds that amount 
to the second decimal place. 
(i) The difference between the 
specified amount (as determined under 
42 CFR 427.302(b)) and the per unit 
GLOBE Model benchmark amount (as 
determined under 42 CFR 513.400(b)); 
or 
(ii) The difference between the 
specified amount (as determined under 
42 CFR 427.302(b)) and the inflation- 
adjusted payment amount (as 
determined under 42 CFR 427.302(g)). 
(2) Limitations. 
(i) When the per unit GLOBE Model benchmark amount is not available as 
determined by CMS as set forth in 42 
CFR 513.400(b)(3), CMS identifies the 
per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount 
by calculating the difference between 
the specified amount (as determined 
under 42 CFR 427.302(b)) and the 
inflation-adjusted payment amount (as 
determined under 42 CFR 427.302(g)). 
(ii) The per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount is set at $0 when the amount 
identified as set forth in paragraph (a) of 
this section is less than $0. 
(b) Calculate the incremental per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount. (1) 
Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, for a GLOBE drug for an 
applicable calendar quarter, CMS 
calculates the incremental per unit 
GLOBE Model rebate amount by 
subtracting the per unit Part B rebate 
amount calculated as set forth in 42 CFR 
427.302(a) from the amount calculated 
as set forth in paragraph (a) of this 
section. The result is the incremental 
per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount 
for the GLOBE drug for an applicable 
calendar quarter. 
(2) Limitation. The incremental per unit GLOBE Model rebate amount is set 
to $0 when the amount calculated in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section is less 
than $0. 
§ 513.520 Identification of the total number 
of GLOBE Model billing units. 
(a) General. (1) CMS identifies the total number of billing units as set forth 
in 42 CFR 427.303, as determined by 
CMS, before identifying GLOBE Model 
billing units. 
(b) Identify GLOBE Model billing units. For an applicable calendar quarter for each GLOBE Model drug, from the 
total number of billing units that CMS 
identified in accordance with 42 CFR 
427.303(b), CMS identifies billing units 
where, on the date of service, the 
beneficiary was identified by CMS as a 
GLOBE Model eligible beneficiary and 
for which Medicare Part B FFS made 
separate payment. 
(c) Identify the total number of GLOBE Model billing units. The sum of the 
billing units identified as set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section equal the 
total number of GLOBE Model billing 
units for the GLOBE Model drug for the 
rebate quarter. 
§ 513.530 Manufacturer payment 
responsibilities. 
(a) General. For the purposes of the GLOBE Model, a manufacturer is 
defined in accordance with 42 CFR 
427.20, in that the manufacturer has the 
meaning set forth in section 
1847A(c)(6)(A) of the Act for a GLOBE 
Model drug as set forth in § 513.130. 
(b) Multiple manufacturers linked to a single HCPCS Level II code. CMS 
apportions the total GLOBE Model 
rebate liability proportionally, based on 
each manufacturer’s reported share of 
Medicare Part B units in that rebate 
quarter in accordance with § 513.500(c).

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260331 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules Subpart G—Manufacturer-Submitted 
International Net Pricing Information 
§ 513.600 Definitions. 
As used in this subpart, the following 
definitions apply: 
Authorized representative means an 
individual, designated by a 
manufacturer, as responsible for 
submitting international drug net 
pricing data, and who is also 
responsible for managing all 
communications related to such 
submission on behalf of the 
manufacturer. The authorized 
representative must also be legally 
authorized to bind the manufacturer to 
the terms and conditions contained 
within the data agreement. 
Applicable international analog 
means a non-US analog whose scientific 
or nonproprietary name, dosage form, 
and route of administration (if 
applicable) align with a GLOBE Model 
drug and that are sold in one or more 
reference countries during the 
applicable ASP calendar quarter, 
excluding those identified in their 
respective country as a generic or 
biosimilar biological product according 
to the country’s own regulations. 
Average net-to-gross ratio means for a 
reference country, the total net sales of 
the set of applicable international 
analogs in the reference country divided 
by the total gross sales of the same set 
of drugs in the same reference country. 
Gross sales amount means for each 
sale the manufacturer made in that 
reference country to a purchaser, the 
amount of money owed to a 
manufacturer by the purchasers, before 
subtracting any discounts, rebates, or 
price concessions. 
Non-U.S. country regulatory approval 
status means information relevant for CMS to determine whether each 
applicable international drug’s 
regulatory approval status (according to 
the applicable reference country’s 
regulatory framework) is an 
international generic (international non- 
originator drug), international biosimilar 
biological product (international non- 
originator drug), international originator 
drug, or other. 
Net price level, with respect to sales 
of applicable international analogs, 
means all sales of the applicable 
international analogs in a reference 
country at the same price net of price 
concessions during the applicable ASP 
calendar quarter. 
Net sales amount means for each sale 
the manufacturer made in that reference 
country to a purchaser, the amount of 
money owed by the purchaser exclusive 
of any price concessions. Each net sales 
amount has a corresponding sales 
volume in HCPCS billing units. 
Price concession means the sum of the 
value of the following types of 
transactions and items whether at the 
time of sale or afterwards: 
(1) Volume discounts: ‘‘Volume 
discounts’’ are also known as quantity 
discounts or bulk discounts where the 
price per unit is reduced when 
purchased in larger quantities. 
(2) Prompt pay discounts: The term 
‘‘prompt pay discounts’’, also known as 
early payment discounts, means any 
reduction in the total value of units 
purchased routinely offered to a 
purchaser when a payment is made 
within a specified timeframe and 
consistent with customary business 
practices for payment. 
(3) Cash discounts: The term ‘‘cash 
discounts’’ refers to reductions on the 
price per unit when payment is made in 
cash. This may be facilitated through 
discount cards, coupons, or other 
agreements. 
(4) Free goods include samples or 
other benefits provided to purchasers or 
patients that are contingent on any 
purchase requirement. 
(5) Chargebacks: This term refers to 
retrospective payments made from 
manufacturers to purchasers. 
(6) Rebates: This term refers to 
reimbursements made by a 
manufacturer to a wholesaler or other 
purchaser, for the difference between 
the price the wholesaler or other 
purchaser initially paid for the product 
and the lower price at which the

calendar quarter as set forth in 42 CFR 
513.710(d) is less than what the 
manufacturer paid for that applicable 
calendar quarter, CMS will initiate the 
process to provide a refund equal to the 
excess amount paid within 60 days of 
the date of receipt of the report with 
such reconciled incremental GLOBE 
Model rebate amount. 
Subpart I—Enforcement of 
Manufacturer Payment of GLOBE 
Model Rebate Amounts 
§ 513.800 Civil money penalty notice and 
appeals procedures. 
(a) General. Under section 1847A(i)(7) of the Act and section 1128A of the Act 
as applicable, CMS may impose a civil 
money penalty on a manufacturer that 
fails to pay the incremental GLOBE 
model rebate amount as set forth in 42 
CFR 513.500 by the payment deadline 
as set forth in 42 CFR 513.740(a) for 
such GLOBE Model drug for such 
applicable calendar quarter. 
(b) Determination of the civil money penalty amount. CMS may impose a 
civil money penalty for each failure by 
a manufacturer to pay the incremental 
GLOBE Model rebate amount; the civil 
money penalty amount is an adjusted 
GLOBE Model rebate amount equal to 
125 percent of the incremental GLOBE 
Model rebate amount determined in 42 
CFR 513.500. 
(1) The civil money penalty is in 
addition to the incremental GLOBE 
Model rebate amount due. 
(2) If a reconciled rebate amount as set 
forth in 42 CFR 513.720 results in an 
increase to the incremental GLOBE 
model rebate amount due, a separate 
civil money penalty may be imposed for 
the failure by a manufacturer to provide 
a total GLOBE Model rebate amount for 
the applicable calendar quarter for the 
increase to the incremental GLOBE 
rebate amount due. 
(c) Notice of imposition of civil money penalties. If CMS makes a determination to impose a civil money penalty 
described in paragraph (b) of this 
section, CMS will send a written notice 
of its decision to impose a civil money 
penalty that includes the following: 
(1) A description of the basis for the 
determination. 
(2) The basis for the penalty. 
(3) The amount of the penalty. 
(4) The date the penalty is due. 
(5) The manufacturer’s right to a 
hearing as specified in paragraph (e) of 
this section. 
(6) Information about where to file the 
request for a hearing. 
(d) Collection. (1) Subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, a manufacturer must pay the 
civil money penalty in full within 60 
calendar days after the date of the notice 
of imposition of a civil money penalty 
from CMS under paragraph (c) of this 
section. 
(2) In the event a manufacturer 
requests a hearing, in accordance with 
42 CFR part 423 subpart T, the 
manufacturer must pay the amount in 
full within 60 calendar days after the 
date of a final decision by the 
Departmental Appeal Board, to uphold, 
in whole or in part, the civil money 
penalty. 
(3) If the 60th calendar day described 
in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this 
section is a weekend or a Federal 
holiday, then the timeframe is extended 
until the end of the next business day. 
(e) Appeal procedures for civil money penalties. Section 1128A(c)(2) of the Act provides that CMS may not collect a 
civil money penalty until the affected 
party has had notice and the 
opportunity for a hearing. 
(1) Manufacturers may appeal the 
following determinations: 
(i) A CMS determination that the 
incremental GLOBE Model rebate 
amount due was not paid by the 
applicable payment deadline as set forth 
in 42 CFR 513.740. 
(ii) The calculation of the amount of 
the civil money penalty. 
(2) If CMS decides to impose a civil 
money penalty, CMS will provide the 
manufacturer with a notice in 
accordance with the process set forth in 
paragraph (c) of this section. 
(3) A manufacturer has a right to a 
hearing following a decision by CMS to 
impose a civil money penalty following 
the administrative appeal process and 
procedures established in 1128A of the 
Act. 
(f) Bankruptcy. In the event that a manufacturer declares bankruptcy, as 
described in Title 11 of the United 
States Code, and as a result of the 
bankruptcy, fails to provide either the 
total GLOBE Model rebate amount owed 
or the total sum of civil money penalties 
imposed, the Government reserves the 
right to file a proof of claim with the 
bankruptcy court to recover the unpaid 
amount of the rebates and civil money 
penalties owed by the manufacturer. 
Subpart J—Quality Strategy, 
Beneficiary Protections, and 
Compliance Activities 
§ 513.900 Quality measures. 
(a) General. Quality measures do not adjust GLOBE Model rebates, GLOBE 
Model beneficiary coinsurance 
percentages, or Medicare payments for 
GLOBE Model drugs and are used for 
monitoring purposes. 
(b) Collection of quality measures. (1) CMS uses existing data sources to the 
extent available. 
(2) If CMS determines it is necessary, 
new surveys to a sample of 
manufacturers, providers and suppliers, 
and beneficiaries who receive a GLOBE 
Model drug may be conducted. A 
sample of non-GLOBE Model 
beneficiaries may also be surveyed. 
§ 513.910 Beneficiary protections. 
In a form and manner specified by 
CMS, CMS will establish procedures for 
collecting complaints from beneficiaries 
and providers about difficulties 
obtaining specific drugs during the 
GLOBE Model performance period.

ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would implement the Guarding U.S. Medicare 
Against Rising Drug Costs (GUARD) 
Model to test a new Medicare payment 
model under section 1115A of the 
Social Security Act. The model 
proposes a test of an alternative 
payment method for calculating 
inflation rebates for certain Part D drugs 
and biological products. The proposed 
GUARD Model would test whether 
changing the calculation of the Part D 
inflation rebate would reduce costs for 
the Medicare program while preserving 
or enhancing quality of care for Part D 
enrollees.

I. Executive Summary 
A. Background 
Challenges related to the affordability 
of prescription drugs adversely affect 
taxpayers by diverting funds that could 
be used to improve health; such 
challenges also pose a direct concern for 
patients, with 55 percent of adults 
reporting that they remain concerned 
about medication affordability.
12
High 
drug costs limit access to care and 
treatment, which in turn, can have 
cascading consequences that lead to 
poor health for patients, increased 
medical spending, and potentially 
avoidable expenditures for all payers, 
including Medicare.
3
Results from 
recent surveys show that many 
Americans, including Medicare 
beneficiaries, face significant financial 
burden of care that has resulted in 
skipping or rationing medication due to 
cost.
4
 
Financial toxicity, or the negative 
impact that the monetary burden of 
medical care can have on patients’ well- 
being, fiscal security, and overall 
health,
5
can be pronounced among the 
elderly population, most of whom are 
covered by Medicare, and among 
patients where the cost of treatment is 
high.
6
One in four adults taking 
prescription drugs report difficulty 
affording their medication, including 40 
percent of those with household income 
of less than $40,000 per year.
7
A 
separate survey conducted concluded 
that about four in 10 older adults with 
Medicare reported problems accessing 
health care because of its costs, and that 
14 percent of Medicare beneficiaries 
said they skipped taking or sometimes 
did not fill their prescription because of 
the expense; this can have serious 
health-related consequences for 
Medicare beneficiaries and may result 
in potentially avoidable costs for 
Medicare.

Continued 
Medicare Part D prescription drug 
costs have been rising over time, with 
total Part D gross drug spending 
increasing from $121 billion in 2014 to 
$276 billion in 2023, an increase of over 
100 percent, as reported by the 
Medicare Payment Advisory 
Commission (MedPAC).
9
This translates 
to an approximately 66 percent increase 
in average gross spending for each 
beneficiary who used Part D drugs over 
that same period ($3,267 in 2014 to 
$5,429 in 2023).
10
The increase in Part 
D gross drug spending is consistent with 
overall trends in U.S. drug spending. A 
recent analysis shows that drug 
spending in the United States increased 
from $600 billion in 2018 to $858 
billion in 2023 for all drugs (a 43 
percent increase), regardless of payer 
source.
11
Retail prescription drug prices 
are expected to continue to increase 
over time, driven by a number of factors, 
including increases in the use of 
prescription drugs as well as increases 
in drug prices over time.
12
 
Existing research finds that the prices 
of drugs sold in the United States are 
much higher than the prices of the same 
drugs sold in other countries. One study 
finds that overall, the U.S. health care 
system spends substantially more on 
outpatient drugs for older adults with 
complex conditions, such as heart 
failure, diabetes, and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
who are mostly covered by Medicare, 
than 11 other economically similar 
countries (including, for example, 
Australia, France, Germany, Canada, 
and the United Kingdom).
13
The authors 
conclude that the United States is 
paying substantially higher prices for 
certain components of health care, 
including for drugs, than other 
countries.
14
Another study finds that 
prices for certain high expenditure 
single-source brand name prescription 
drugs covered under Medicare Part D in 
2018 were 3 to 4 times higher in the 
United States, even after accounting for 
estimated manufacturer rebate amounts, 
compared to their prices in the United 
Kingdom, Japan, and Canada.
15
Among 
these countries, Japan and Canada use 
international reference pricing to help 
determine drug prices within the 
country.
16
Analyses by IQVIA show that 
per capita utilization of drugs is higher 
in certain regions and countries, 
specifically, in Western European 
countries and Japan, compared to North 
American countries, suggesting that 
utilization differences alone are not the 
drivers of the observed price 
differences.
17
The data also shows that 
U.S. brand-name prescription drug 
prices exceed those found in other 
Organization for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) countries.
18 19
 
The disparity between U.S. drug 
prices and prices in other economically 
comparable countries may have several 
drivers, but a key component is the 
substantial difference in the way 
prescription drug prices are determined 
in the United States and other 
economically comparable countries. 
Although there is wide variation in the 
way drug prices are determined in 
economically comparable countries, in 
general, many countries take a more 
centralized approach to drug pricing 
and/or have greater involvement in 
determining prices for drugs than the 
United States.
20
 
In the United States, prices are set by 
drug manufacturers for the U.S. market 
and the incentives and payment 
mechanisms embedded within the U.S. 
pharmaceutical drug supply chain are 
complex. Drug manufacturers set a 
Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC), 
which is the published catalog or ‘‘list 
price’’ for a drug product; this 
represents the amount at which 
wholesalers are offered the drug 
product.
21
The manufacturer list price is 
not the ultimate net revenue realized by 
the manufacturer as there are multiple 
discounts and price concessions to 
stakeholders throughout the 
pharmaceutical drug supply chain; 
however, it may have influence 
throughout the pharmaceutical drug 
supply chain. Existing research shows 
that the list price of new brand-name 
drugs at launch have been increasing 
over time, with one study finding that 
from 2008 to 2021, the mean launch 
price increased by 13 percent per year; 
this increase was 11 percent per year for 
a subset of drugs for which the 
researchers were able to account for 
manufacturer rebates and drug 
characteristics.
22
 
There are many factors that affect the 
amount that is ultimately paid by 
stakeholders for a pharmaceutical drug 
after discounts, rebates, and other price 
concessions are excluded (referred to as 
the ‘net price’), including the degree to 
which the drug is subject to market 
competition. In general (though there 
may be exceptions), drugs that face 
more limited competition have higher 
net prices than drugs that have greater 
market competition.

multiple titles of the U.S. Code. The relevant

Program are found at 42 U.S.C. 1320f–1 through

Application-level refers to the New Drug 
Application (NDA) or Biologics License application 
with competing therapies available, 
drug manufacturers have a particular 
incentive to compete against each other 
for formulary coverage by negotiating 
rebates with plan sponsors or their 
pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). 
Within Part D, this generally includes 
drugs that are not in protected classes. (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services (CMS) protected classes are 
drugs for which Part D sponsors must 
include all or substantially all drugs 
within the classes on their formularies, 
which means that manufacturers do not 
have the same incentives to negotiate 
rebates or other price concession for 
these drugs.)
26
Ultimately, the 
negotiated rebates and other price 
concessions result in a ‘‘net’’ price (that 
is, list price net of rebates and other 
price concessions) for the drug that is 
lower than the list price.
27
Under the 
Part D program, this post point-of-sale 
compensation is included in Direct and 
Indirect Remuneration (DIR)
28
and is 
factored into CMS’s calculation of final 
Medicare payments to Part D plans.
29
 
This, in turn, impacts Medicare costs 
under the Medicare Prescription Drug 
Benefit program, also known as Part D, 
which was created under the Medicare 
Prescription Drug, Improvement, and 
Modernization Act of 2003 (Pub. L. 108– 
173, 117 Stat. 2066).
30
 
Under the Part D program, drug price 
negotiations take place between Part D 
plan sponsors (or their PBMs) and 
pharmaceutical manufacturers. Until 
recently, the federal government has not 
been a participant in the negotiations for 
drug prices.
31
The Medicare program 
does not currently use international 
reference pricing, which broadly refers 
to the practice of taking pharmaceutical 
pricing data from other economically 
comparable countries into account in 
identifying domestic prices for drugs.
32
 
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 
(IRA), Public Law 117–169, included a 
series of provisions, including the 
Medicare Drug Price Negotiation 
Program, which authorizes the Secretary 
of the Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS) (hereafter, ‘‘the 
Secretary’’) to negotiate the prices of 
certain qualifying high expenditure 
single source drugs without generic or 
biosimilar competition with 
manufacturers; however, the Medicare 
Drug Price Negotiation Program does 
not consider the prices of drugs in other 
economically similar countries
33
in 
negotiating the maximum fair price 
(MFP). 
B. Purpose 
The prices of certain prescription 
drugs in the United States, including 
those covered under Part D, remain 
high, which contributes to increased 
costs under Part D. To address high 
spending under Part D, CMS proposes 
the testing of a new mandatory model 
under section 1115A of the Social 
Security Act (the Act), which authorizes 
the CMS’ Center for Medicare and 
Medicaid Innovation (hereafter, ‘‘the 
CMS Innovation Center’’) to test 
innovative payment and service 
delivery models for the purpose of 
evaluating whether they will reduce 
Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s 
Health Insurance Program (CHIP) 
expenditures while preserving or 
enhancing the quality of care furnished 
to the beneficiaries of such programs. 
The IRA included the Part D Inflation 
Rebate Program, which requires drug 
manufacturers to pay a rebate if they 
raise their prices for certain drugs faster 
than the rate of inflation. This rebate is 
paid to the Medicare Prescription Drug 
Account in the Federal Supplementary 
Medical Insurance Trust Fund and is 
calculated and invoiced by CMS. The 
CMS Innovation Center, under its 
statutory authority, is proposing an 
innovative payment model that would 
test an alternative approach to the IRA’s 
Part D Inflation Rebate Program that 
would change the calculation of the Part 
D drug inflation rebates for certain Part 
D drugs and biological products for the 
purpose of evaluating whether this 
approach would reduce program 
expenditures while maintaining or 
enhancing quality of care for 
beneficiaries. CMS proposes that the 
model’s period of performance would 
begin on January 1, 2027 and end on 
December 31, 2033 and the payment 
period for the model would begin on 
January 1, 2027 and end on December 
31, 2035. 
C. Summary of Major Provisions 
The proposed Guarding U.S. Medicare 
Against Rising Drug Costs (GUARD) 
Model would test changes to the Part D 
Inflation Rebate Program, specifically 
testing whether an alternative 
calculation for the Part D inflation 
rebate calculation for certain drugs and 
biological products would reduce 
program spending for Medicare and 
taxpayers while preserving or enhancing 
the quality of care furnished to 
Medicare beneficiaries. The proposed 
model includes the following major 
provisions: 
€The GUARD Model would include a subset of Part D rebatable drugs that 
are included in the Part D Inflation 
Rebate Program. Specifically, the 
GUARD Model would include sole- 
source drugs and sole-source biological 
products that are in the following 
specific therapeutic categories: 
Analgesics; Anticonvulsants; 
Antidepressants; Antimigraine Agents; 
Antineoplastics; Antipsychotics; 
Antivirals; Bipolar Agents; Blood 
Glucose Regulators; Cardiovascular 
Agents; Central Nervous System Agents; 
Gastrointestinal Agents; Genetic or 
Enzyme or Protein Disorder: 
Replacement or Modifiers or Treatment; 
Immunological Agents; Metabolic Bone 
Disease Agents; Ophthalmic Agents; and 
Respiratory Tract/Pulmonary Agents. 
The GUARD Model would exclude: (1) 
generics and biosimilar biological 
products; (2) sole-source drugs or sole- 
source biological products with annual 
application-level

This means the total gross covered prescription 
drug costs for all Part D rebatable NDC–9s 
associated with the same application (NDA or BLA) 
as the GUARD Model drug. 
35
To be a part of the set of international analogs, 
an international product must have an active 
ingredient, route of administration, dosage form, 
and strength that aligns with that of the GUARD 
Model drug. 
36
Individual countries differ in the regulatory 
processes and standards governing approval of 
drugs and biological products. Use of international 
drug prices in the proposed GUARD Model should 
not be interpreted to connote FDA approval or to 
otherwise describe any scientific or regulatory 
relationship between U.S.-approved and non-U.S.- 
approved products. 
37
Where net pricing refers to drug prices 
exclusive of any discounts, rebates, or price 
concessions offered by manufacturers. 
drug costs below the GUARD minimum 
spend threshold; and (3) drugs that are 
subject to a negotiated MFP, during the 
price applicability period. 
€Manufacturers of Part D rebatable drugs, as defined in section 1927(k)(5) 
of the Act and 42 CFR 428.20, that 
receive a Part D inflation rebate report 
that includes a GUARD Model drug 
during an applicable period that 
overlaps with the GUARD Model 
performance period would be required 
to participate in the GUARD Model. 
€The GUARD Model would select reference countries that are 
economically comparable to the United 
States by implementing the following 
criteria: the country must be included as 
an OECD country; must have a 
minimum of 60 percent of the United 
States’s purchasing power parity (PPP)- 
adjusted per capita gross domestic 
product (GDP), and must have a 
minimum $400 billion (PPP)-adjusted 
aggregate GDP. The reference countries 
that meet these criteria and are therefore 
proposed to be selected for the model 
are the following: Australia, Austria, 
Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, 
Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, 
Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. 
€CMS proposes to test two approaches to calculating the GUARD 
Model international benchmark: the 
default international benchmark (also 
referred to as Method I) and the updated 
international benchmark (also referred 
to as Method II). 
€For each GUARD Model drug for which data on international drug 
pricing in reference countries is 
available, CMS would calculate the 
GUARD Model default international 
benchmark. The GUARD Model default 
international benchmark for each 
GUARD Model drug would be identified 
as the lowest country-level average price 
among the set of average prices for each 
reference country, adjusted by the 
country-specific GDP based on PPP 
(hereafter, ‘‘GDP (PPP)’’) adjuster, where 
an international product that is part of 
a GUARD Model drug’s set of 
international analogs is sold.
35 36
 
€CMS would provide manufacturers with the option to submit international 
drug net pricing
37
data for the set of 
reference countries where international 
products that are part of a GUARD 
Model drug’s set of international 
analogs are sold, including the across- 
country average net price. This 
submitted across-country average net 
price accounts for country-specific 
differences using a GDP (PPP) adjuster; 
if the data submitted is determined to be 
an applicable submission, it would 
become the GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark. 
€CMS would determine a GUARD Model applicable international 
benchmark for each GUARD Model drug 
that would be the greater of the GUARD 
Model default international benchmark 
and the GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark, unless there is 
only a GUARD Model default 
international benchmark. If there is only 
a GUARD Model default international 
benchmark, it would become the 
GUARD Model applicable international 
benchmark. 
€CMS would use this information to test an alternative inflation rebate 
payment calculation to determine 
whether manufacturers owe a GUARD 
Model rebate payment. The alternative 
inflation rebate calculation tested under 
the GUARD Model would compare a 
Medicare net price against the GUARD 
Model applicable international 
benchmark. 
€The GUARD Model would require manufacturers to pay a GUARD Model 
rebate payment if the Medicare net price 
is greater than the GUARD Model 
applicable international benchmark for 
a GUARD Model drug. The Medicare net 
price would be calculated by subtracting 
manufacturer rebates (obtained from 
DIR) and discounts (under the 
Manufacturer Discount Program) from 
the WAC of the GUARD Model drug. 
€The total GUARD Model rebate amount would be equal to the product 
of the per unit GUARD Model rebate 
amount for a GUARD Model drug for the 
performance year and the total number 
of units of the GUARD Model drug 
dispensed under Part D and covered by 
Part D plan sponsors in the GUARD 
Model geographic areas for the 
performance year. 
€When the per unit GUARD Model rebate exceeds the per unit Part D 
inflation rebate amount, CMS would 
waive the rebate amount described in 
section 1860D–14B(b) of the Act and 
instead apply the GUARD Model rebate 
amount. The GUARD Model rebate 
payment would be deposited into the 
Medicare Prescription Drug Account in 
the Federal Supplementary Medical 
Insurance Trust Fund. 
€The GUARD Model evaluation would examine the main outcome, 
Medicare net spending, as well as 
additional outcomes of the GUARD 
Model, including the ways in which 
Part D plan benefits may change for 
GUARD Model drugs and whether and 
to what extent there are impacts on 
beneficiary cost sharing for GUARD 
Model drugs. 
We also propose to waive program 
requirements that are necessary solely 
for the purposes of testing the GUARD 
Model. We propose to issue these 
waivers using our waiver authority 
under section 1115A(d)(1) of the Act. 
Specifically, we propose to waive the 
provisions in section 1860D–14B(b)(1) 
of the Act, which are the Medicare Part 
D inflation rebate calculation 
provisions; and, we propose to waive 
the provisions in section 1860D– 
14B(a)(1) of the Act, which describes the 
timing requirements for manufacturer 
rebates reports issued by CMS. Each of 
the proposed waivers is discussed in 
detail in section IV.R. this proposed 
rule.

II. Background 
Prescription drug prices in the United 
States have been increasing over time, 
and the prices of certain drugs sold in 
the United States are substantially 
higher than prices in economically 
comparable countries. High prescription 
drug prices in the United States 
influence Part D spending, which has 
also increased over time (as we discuss 
later in this section). 
A. Prescription Drug Prices in the 
United States 
Medicare prescription drug costs have 
been rising over time, with total Part D 
gross drug spending increasing from 
$121 billion in 2014 to $276 billion in 
2023, an increase of nearly 10 percent 
annually.
38
In 2024, Part D drug 
spending represented a large portion 
(about 40 percent)
39
of overall gross 
drug spending in the United States. The 
increase in Part D gross drug spending 
is consistent with overall trends in U.S. 
drug spending, which are rising over 
time. Gross drug spending has increased 
from $600 billion in 2018 to $858 
billion in 2023 for all drugs, regardless 
of payer source.
40
Net drug spending 
increased by 11.4 percent in 2024 (from 
$437.1 billion in 2023 to $487 billion in 
2024), more than double the increase 
from the previous year (4.9 percent 
growth in 2023, from $416.8 billion in 
2022 to $437.1 billion in 2023).
41
These 
increases are driven by many factors; 
the way the United States pays for 
prescription drugs and the complex 
pharmaceutical drug supply chain also 
play a role. 
Existing research shows that the 
prices of drugs in the United States are 
much higher than prices for the same 
drugs sold in other countries and this 
gap is increasing over time.
42 43
In 2024, 
the United States accounted for less 
than 5 percent of the world’s population 
(4.22)
44
and about 15 percent (14.9) of 
the world’s real gross domestic product 
(GDP),
45
but U.S. gross spending on 
drugs accounted for over half of the 
world’s gross spending on drugs (53.2 
percent)
46
and only about 10 percent of 
the volume sold.
47
Among countries in 
the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD), 
in 2024, the United States accounted for 
about 63 percent of spending on 
prescription drugs, but only 22 percent 
of the volume.
48
 
Research from Office of Assistant 
Secretary for Planning and Evaluation 
(ASPE) and the RAND Corporation

patterns and present findings on how 
U.S. prescription drug costs compare to 
international benchmarks. ASPE’s

drug prices exceeded those of non-U.S. 
OECD countries combined in 2018. 
Specifically, U.S. gross prices for brand- 
name drugs were 344 percent of prices 
in non-U.S. countries.
49
The study also 
found that unbranded generic drugs had 
lower U.S. prices compared to the prices 
in other OECD countries. A 2024 report 
revealed an even larger gap, U.S. gross 
prices for certain drugs are higher than 
other countries. Specifically, for brand- 
name originator drugs,
50
U.S. prices are 
approximately 422 percent of prices in 
economically comparable countries or at 
least 322 percent if adjusted for rebates 
in the United States (but not in other 
countries).
51
The same study showed 
the United States paid less for 
unbranded generic drugs; specifically, 
U.S. prices for these drugs represent 
approximately 67 percent of the OECD 
countries combined. This indicates that 
pricing patterns vary between brand- 
name originator drugs and generic drugs 
in the U.S. market. This body of 
research also suggests that U.S. drug 
prices for brand-name originator drugs 
are growing faster than drug prices in 
other countries. 
The widening gap over time between 
U.S. drug prices and prices in other 
economically comparable countries for 
certain types of drugs exist for many 
reasons. However, one component is the 
substantial difference in the way the 
United States and other economically 
comparable countries approach 
prescription drug pricing. Although 
there is wide variation in the way 
economically comparable countries 
determine prices, in general, many 
countries take a more centralized 
approach to drug pricing and may have 
greater involvement in establishing 
prices for drugs than the United 
States.
52
 
The U.S. market and the incentives 
and payment mechanisms embedded 
within the U.S. pharmaceutical drug 
supply chain are complex. Drug 
manufacturers set the list price, also 
known as the Wholesale Acquisition 
Cost (WAC), which serves as the initial 
anchor price for a drug throughout the 
complex pharmaceutical drug supply 
chain market in the United States.
53
The 
pharmaceutical drug supply chain 
consists of many stakeholders, each 
with differing, potentially complex 
roles. Stakeholders include drug 
manufacturers, drug wholesalers, 
pharmacies, group purchasing 
organizations (GPOs), payers (that is, 
insurance plans, including Part D 
plans), and pharmacy benefit managers 
(PBMs).
54
When payers, including 
Medicare Advantage organizations 
offering Part D prescription drug 
coverage and standalone Part D plans, 
reimburse the pharmacy for a drug, the 
reimbursement is based on a negotiated 
payment amount for the drug plus a 
dispensing fee. Payers, including Part D 
plan sponsors, often contract with 
PBMs, which administer the outpatient 
pharmacy benefit and negotiate rebates 
with manufacturers. For drugs in 
competitive therapeutic classes, PBMs 
often negotiate with manufacturers to 
receive rebates in exchange for preferred 
formulary placement. These rebates, 
which are not typically applied at point- 
of-sale, ultimately reduce the net price 
of the drug faced by the payer. Under 
the Part D program, the post point-of- 
sale compensation is included in direct 
and indirect remuneration (DIR), and it 
is factored into the Centers for Medicare 
& Medicaid Services (CMS) calculation 
of final Medicare payments to Part D 
plans.
55
This, in turn, impacts Medicare 
costs, including premiums, under the 
Part D program. 
B. The Medicare Prescription Drug 
Benefit (Medicare Part D) 
The Medicare Voluntary Prescription 
Drug Benefit Program, also known as 
Part D, is a federal prescription drug 
coverage program established under 
Title XVIII, Part D of the Social Security 
Act (hereafter, ‘‘the Act’’) (sections 
1860D–1 through 1860D–43 of the Act), 
as added by section 101 of the Medicare 
Prescription Drug, Improvement, and 
Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA); the 
program provides outpatient 
prescription drug coverage to Medicare 
beneficiaries.
56
Section 1860D–15 of the 
Act specifies the payment methodology 
for Part D plan sponsors, including 
direct subsidy payments, reinsurance, 
and risk corridor payments, as well as 
beneficiary premiums. The program is 
administered by private insurers 
through either standalone prescription 
drug plans (PDPs) or Medicare 
Advantage prescription drug (MA–PD) 
plans.
57
The prices of prescription drugs 
covered by a Part D plan are negotiated 
between the plan sponsor or its PBM 
and pharmaceutical drug 
manufacturers.
58
 
Under the program, Medicare 
typically subsidizes a portion of the Part 
D basic benefit costs for enrollees 
through reinsurance and direct subsidy 
payments made to Part D plans, and 
provides additional premium and cost 
sharing subsidies for low-income 
enrollees through the low-income 
subsidy (LIS) program.
59
Beneficiaries 
who voluntarily enroll in a Part D plan 
typically pay a monthly premium, and 
depending on their specific plan and 
drug utilization, may have to pay an 
annual deductible, copayments, and 
coinsurance. 
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 
(IRA), Public Law 117–169, made 
several additions and amendments to 
the Act that affected the structure of the 
defined standard Part D drug benefit. 
Currently, the Part D defined standard 
benefit consists of three phases that 
enrollees go through depending on their 
use and cost of drugs: the deductible 
phase, the initial coverage phase, and 
the catastrophic coverage phase. Plans 
are responsible for setting the specific

For eligible enrollees whose income and 
resources are limited, the Medicare Prescription 
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 
established Extra Help (a subsidy) for prescription 
drugs, which provides financial assistance for 
prescription drugs (premiums, deductibles, and co- 
payments). Under the IRA, beginning in 2024, the 
LIS program is expanded to individuals with 
limited financial resources and incomes up to 150 
percent of the Federal Poverty Limit (FPL).

deductible, up to a maximum of $615 in 
2026.
60
In the 2026 defined standard 
benefit, enrollees are responsible for 25 
percent of drug costs until their true 
out-of-pocket (TrOOP) spending reaches 
$2,100, after which they enter the 
catastrophic coverage phase. Once 
enrollees reach the catastrophic 
coverage phase, they are not responsible 
for any further out-of-pocket payments 
for a covered Part D drug. The 
deductible and $2,100 annual out-of- 
pocket cap in effect for 2026 will be 
adjusted each year based on the annual 
percentage increase in average 
expenditures for covered Part D drugs 
among Part D eligible individuals in the 
United States.
61
In the defined standard 
benefit initial coverage phase, 
manufacturers are typically responsible 
for 10 percent of costs for certain brand 
drugs and biologics under the 
Manufacturer Discount Program and 
Part D plans are typically responsible 
for 65 percent.
62
In the catastrophic 
coverage phase, Part D plans are 
typically responsible for 60 percent of 
drug costs, drug manufacturers are 
typically responsible for 20 percent, and 
Medicare pays the remaining 20 percent 
for brand-name drugs and biologics.
63
 
Under section 1860D–2(a)(1) of the 
Act, each Part D plan is required to offer 
either the defined standard benefit, as 
described previously, or an alternative 
coverage structure that is actuarially 
equivalent to the defined standard 
benefit. In addition, under section 
1860D–2(a)(2) of the Act, Part D plan 
sponsors may offer enhanced or 
supplemental benefits. Analysis of the 
landscape files available on CMS.gov 
reveal that for 2026, 49 percent of 
standalone Part D plan offerings include 
enhanced benefits and 98 percent of 
MA–PD plans have enhanced benefits.
64
 
This flexibility allows Part D plans to 
compete for enrollees based on the 
benefit design and premiums. It also 
leads to differences between plans’ 
specific design (for example, whether 
they require a deductible and, if so, the 
deductible amount); coverage (for 
example, the specific drugs covered and 
tier placement of covered drugs); 
beneficiary cost sharing (for example, 
whether a drug is subject to coinsurance 
or copayment); and other components. 
Each plan maintains its own formulary, 
consistent with Medicare formulary 
requirements in 42 CFR 423.120(b)(2) 
and 423.272(b)(2). CMS evaluates 
formularies based on requirements, 
including sufficiency of categories and 
classes, tier placement, and utilization 
management restrictions. These 
requirements include, for example, that 
each plan must cover at least two drugs 
within each therapeutic category and 
class and generally, all drugs within the 
six protected classes 
(immunosuppressants, antidepressants, 
antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, 
antiretrovirals, and antineoplastics)
65
as 
well as selected drugs under the 
Medicare Drug Price Negotiation 
Program for which a negotiated 
maximum fair price (MFP) is in effect. 
The Medicare Payment Advisory 
Commission (MedPAC) has reported 
that in 2023, Part D covered 54.9 million 
enrollees, of which about 14 million 
were enrolled in LIS;
66
Part D enrollees 
had total gross spending of about $276 
billion, which translates to about $5,429 
per Part D enrollee who used a Part D 
covered drug.
67
Previous research by 
ASPE has found that in 2019, about 5.7 
million Medicare beneficiaries did not 
have prescription drug coverage.
68
 
To offer the Part D benefit, under 
section 1860D–11(b) of the Act, each 
Part D plan sponsor must submit an 
annual bid to CMS for each plan it 
intends to offer, including the plan’s 
benefit design, service area, and the 
sponsor’s actuarial estimate of the 
expected cost of covering the standard 
benefit for an average enrollee.
69
These 
bids, which are due to CMS annually in 
June, use actuarial methods to project 
gross drug costs at the point of sale and 
subtract expected manufacturer rebates, 
other price concessions, and other 
components to estimate the net plan 
liability. As part of the process of bid 
development, Part D plan sponsors 
consider the price of a drug, the 
estimated rebate payments and price 
concessions from various entities, 
including pharmacies and drug 
manufacturers, and other factors. 
Manufacturer rebates represent the 
majority of these rebates received by 
Part D plans and substantially reduce 
Part D plans’ net drug costs.
70
Part D 
plan bids are used to calculate the Part 
D National Average Monthly Bid 
Amount (NAMBA) and derive the base 
beneficiary premium (BBP) amount. 
Although the BBP does not represent 
the actual premiums paid by Part D 
enrollees, which is dependent on 
individual Part D plan offerings, this 
estimate influences the average level of 
enrollee premiums across the Part D 
plan market. Typically, Medicare 
subsidizes 74.5 percent of the average 
cost of basic benefits in the form of 
direct subsidies and reinsurance. 
However in 2025, MedPAC reports that 
the Medicare subsidy increased to about 
83 percent of the average cost of basic 
benefits due to the IRA’s premium cap 
that institutes a 6 percent cap on annual 
increases in the BBP.
71
 
C. Recent Drug Pricing Policy Reforms 
The IRA’s amendments to Part D of 
Title XVIII of the Act included 
provisions that change the Part D 
benefit. As part of these changes, the 
IRA included several provisions that 
directly changed manufacturer liability 
under the Part D program.

See sections 1860D–2(b)(4)(C)(iii) and (E) of the 
Social Security Act). 
Section 11102(a) of the IRA added 
new section 1860D–14B of the Act, 
which establishes requirements for drug 
manufacturers to pay inflation rebates 
for certain Part D drugs. Specifically, 
pharmaceutical drug manufacturers that 
increase the price for a Part D rebatable 
drug faster than the rate of inflation (as 
measured by changes in the Consumer 
Price Index for all Urban Consumers, 
CPI–U), as described in section 1860D– 
14B of the Act, are required to pay Part 
D drug inflation rebates to the Medicare 
Prescription Drug Account in the 
Federal Supplementary Medical 
Insurance Trust Fund for each 12-month 
applicable period. 
Under these provisions, a ‘‘Part D 
rebatable drug’’ is defined as a drug or 
biological described at section 1860D– 
14B(g)(1)(C) of the Act and is: (1) a drug 
approved under a New Drug 
Application (NDA) under section 505(c) 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
(FD&C) Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.); (2) 
a drug approved under an Abbreviated 
New Drug Application (ANDA) under 
section 505(j) of the FD&C Act that 
meets the criteria in section 1860D– 
14B(g)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act; or (3) a 
biological licensed under section 351 of 
the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 
U.S.C. 201 et seq.). In general, the 
statute excludes multi-source generic 
drugs from the definition of a Part D 
rebatable drug and limits generics that 
may be Part D rebatable drugs to sole- 
source generics—that is, generic drugs 
for which (1) the reference listed drug 
approved under section 505(c) of FD&C 
Act, including any ‘‘authorized generic 
drug’’ (as that term is defined in section 
505(t)(3) of the FD&C Act), is not being 
marketed, as identified in the Food and 
Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) National 
Drug Code (NDC) Directory; (2) there is 
no other drug approved under section 
505(j) of the FD&C Act that is rated as 
therapeutically equivalent and that is 
being marketed, as identified in FDA’s 
NDC Directory; (3) the manufacturer is 
not a ‘‘first applicant’’ during the 180- 
day exclusivity period; and (4) the 
manufacturer is not a ‘‘first approved 
applicant’’ for a competitive generics 
therapy. The Part D Inflation Rebate 
Program also excludes drugs or 
biological products with an average 
annual total cost under Part D of less 
than $100 per individual using such 
drug or biological product for the first 
applicable period; this amount is 
adjusted by percentage changes in the 
CPI–U annually thereafter. 
The Part D inflation rebate calculation 
examines year-over-year changes to 
determine whether an inflation rebate is 
owed for a Part D rebatable drug. 
Specifically, the Part D inflation rebates 
are calculated, as reported under section 
1927(b)(3) of the Act
72
and further 
clarified in a December 2023 
guidance,
73
for each Part D rebatable 
drug by establishing a historical 
benchmark price and comparing this 
price against the price for an applicable 
12-month period. The inflation rebate 
amounts are based on the difference 
between the drug’s volume weighted 
annual average manufacturer price 
(AnMP) in a given 12-month applicable 
period and the inflation-adjusted 
volume weighted annual average 
manufacturer price of the benchmark 
period. This means if the Part D 
rebatable drug’s AnMP in an applicable 
period exceeds the drug’s inflation 
adjusted payment amount, an inflation 
rebate amount would be due. The 
average manufacturer price (AMP) 
represents the average price paid to the 
manufacturer for the drug in the United 
States by wholesalers. 
The statute defines an ‘‘applicable 
period’’ to mean a 12-month period 
beginning with October 1 of a year 
(beginning with October 1, 2022). As 
such, October 1, 2022 was the beginning 
of the first 12-month period for which 
drug manufacturers will be required to 
pay rebates to Medicare if a Part D 
rebatable drug’s price increases faster 
than the rate of inflation over the 12- 
month period. December 31, 2025 is the 
date by which CMS is required to begin 
invoicing pharmaceutical drug 
manufacturers for the Part D inflation 
rebates they owed Medicare for the 12- 
month applicable periods that began on 
October 1, 2022 and October 1, 2023.
74
 
For subsequent applicable periods, CMS 
must invoice pharmaceutical drug 
manufacturers for any Part D inflation 
rebates they owe Medicare by no later 
than 9 months after the end of the 
applicable period. 
Section 11201 of the IRA, as codified 
in sections 1860D–14C and 1860D–43 of 
the Act, established a new Manufacturer 
Discount Program, which became 
effective January 1, 2025. The 
Manufacturer Discount Program 
replaced the Medicare Coverage Gap 
Discount Program (CGDP), which was 
enacted into law in section 3301 of the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act (Pub. L. 111–148), as amended by 
section 1101 of the Health Care and 
Education Reconciliation Act (HCERA) 
of 2010 (Pub. L. 111–152) (referred to 
collectively as the Affordable Care Act) 
and codified in sections 1860D–14A and 
1860D–43 of the Act. Effective January 
1, 2011, the CGDP made manufacturer 
discounts for brand name drugs and 
biologic products (with biosimilars 
included starting in 2019) available to 
applicable beneficiaries at the point of 
sale. The CGDP provided non-low- 
income subsidy beneficiaries in the 
coverage gap phase of the Part D benefit, 
a 50 percent discount on the negotiated 
price of the drug at point of sale. For an 
applicable drug to be covered under Part 
D, the manufacturer had to sign a 
manufacturer agreement with the 
Secretary. 
Section 53116 of the Bipartisan 
Budget Act of 2018 (BBA) (Pub. L. 115– 
123), changed the CGDP amount from 
50 to 70 percent for applicable 
beneficiaries beginning in 2019. The 
BBA also reduced beneficiary cost 
sharing in the coverage gap phase to 25 
percent in 2019 and subsequent years. 
The CGDP was sunset effective 
December 31, 2024, and the new 
Manufacturer Discount Program became 
effective January 1, 2025. The 
Manufacturer Discount Program differs 
from the CGDP in several important 
ways. First, the Manufacturer Discount 
Program discount is applied to 
applicable drugs dispensed to 
beneficiaries who receive a low-income 
subsidy as well as those who do not. 
Also, discounts are applied in the initial 
coverage and catastrophic phase of the 
benefit at 10 and 20 percent, 
respectively. The IRA outlined a method 
to identify certain specified 
manufacturers and specified small 
manufacturers, as defined in statute, 
and set forth a multiyear phase-in 
period to phase-in the full discount 
percentages for these manufacturers. 
Finally, unlike the CGDP, Manufacturer 
Discount Program discounts do not 
count towards a beneficiary’s TrOOP
75
 
costs (meaning that manufacturer 
payments made under the Manufacturer 
Discount Program will not accrue to a 
beneficiary’s incurred costs). 
The IRA also established the Medicare 
Drug Price Negotiation Program, 
codified in sections 1191 through 1198

of the Act, which gave the Secretary 
authority to negotiate a MFP for certain 
high expenditure, single source drugs 
and biologics without generic or 
biosimilar competition with 
participating drug manufacturers. The 
program began with a set of drugs 
covered under Part D and expands over 
time to include drugs payable under 
Part B that meet the criteria. On August 
29, 2023, CMS published the list of 10 
drugs covered under Part D selected for 
initial price applicability year 2026; the 
negotiated MFPs for these drugs will go 
into effect on January 1, 2026.
76
The 
second set of 15 drugs covered under 
Part D that were selected for negotiation 
for 2027 were announced on January 17, 
2025, and the MFPs, if agreed upon by 
the manufacturers and CMS, for these 
drugs are expected to go into effect on 
January 1, 2027.

D. High Drug Costs Under Part D 
Although the provisions under the 
IRA included a series of changes to the 
Part D benefit, including allowing 
Medicare to negotiate for certain drugs, 
they do not fully address the issue of 
high drug spending in the Part D 
program. High drug prices affect Part D 
spending, particularly for certain types 
of drugs (for example, single-source 
brand-name drugs), and influence 
overall program spending. Moreover, 
enrollees may ration their prescription 
drugs due to cost, which can have 
serious health-related consequences for 
Medicare enrollees and may result in 
avoidable costs for Medicare.
78
 
Part D gross drug spending has risen 
over time (from $348 gross drug 
spending per month per LIS enrollee in 
2010 to $765 gross drug spending per 
month per LIS enrollee in 2023 and 
$163 per month per non-LIS enrollee in 
2010 to $309 per month per non-LIS 
enrollee in 2023).
79
Analyses show that 
Part D gross spending is concentrated 
among certain types of drugs, 
particularly certain types of brand name 
drugs such as specialty drugs. One 
study examined trends in total gross 
drug spending under Part D between 
2012 to 2021 specifically for drugs with 
the top 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 
percent of spending. Findings showed 
that gross drug costs increased by 103 
percent from 2012 to 2021, driven both 
by increases in the number of 
prescriptions as well as increases in 
prices for existing drugs. Drugs in the 
top 1 percent of spending in Part D 
accounted for an increasing share of 
total gross drug costs over time, 
increasing from 31.4 percent to 41.1 
percent from 2012 to 2021. Spending 
specifically for specialty drugs 
increased by over 500 percent over the 
study period and accounted for 71.1 
percent of total gross drug costs in 2021, 
even though specialty drugs accounted 
for 6.2 percent of prescriptions in 
2021.
80
 
In 2023, MedPAC reported that 
Medicare gross spending on brand-name 
drugs was about $171.2 billion and 
spending on biologics was about $60 
billion, collectively representing about 
84 percent of the total gross drug 
spending.
81
Generic drugs represented 
the remaining 15 percent of spending.
82
 
Additionally, although there were more 
prescriptions filled for generic drugs 
(about 82 percent across the top 15 
therapeutic classes, including diabetic 
therapy, antineoplastics, anticoagulants, 
asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) agents, and others in 
2023), the majority of gross spending (91 
percent) was for brand-name products 
within these therapeutic classes.
83
 
Enrollee out-of-pocket costs for drugs 
covered under Part D vary based on 
several factors. Research by ASPE finds 
that in 2022, Part D enrollees who do 
not receive LIS had greater average out- 
of-pocket costs than their LIS enrollee 
counterparts ($464 per non-LIS enrollee 
vs. $52 per LIS enrollee); these 
differences are particularly pronounced 
for enrollees who reached the 
catastrophic coverage phase of the Part 
D benefit ($3,093 per non-LIS enrollee 
vs. $87 per LIS enrollee). ASPE analysis 
also finds that, prior to the IRA’s out-of- 
pocket cap going into effect, among 
enrollees who reached the catastrophic 
coverage phase of the Part D benefit, 
annual out-of-pocket prescription drug 
costs were highest for enrollees with 
certain health conditions (such as 
enrollees with cystic fibrosis, metabolic 
and immune disorders, certain types of 
cancers, and those who have undergone 
major organ transplant) and those who 
take certain types of medications. For 
example, enrollees who took certain 
brand name single source drugs used to 
treat cancers had significantly higher 
out-of-pocket costs than the average Part 
D enrollee.
84
 
The IRA caps enrollees’ out-of-pocket 
costs for prescription drugs at $2,100 in 
2026 (and this cap is adjusted annually 
based on the annual percentage increase 
in average expenditures for covered Part 
D drugs in the United States for Part D 
eligible individuals in the previous 
year), which reduces the out-of-pocket 
costs for certain Part D enrollees who 
take expensive medications covered 
under the Part D program. However, 
although the provision has gone into 
effect, there remain concerns about the 
affordability of prescription drugs 
covered under Part D. Specifically, there 
is concern that Part D plan sponsors are 
shifting from a fixed copayment model 
for high-cost brand-name drugs to a 
coinsurance-based model, where the 
enrollee pays a percentage of the price 
at the point-of-sale in the pharmacy, 
potentially exposing Part D enrollees 
who take certain drugs to higher costs.
85

Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey 
(MCBS) finds that nine percent of 
Medicare beneficiaries reported that

In addition, unlike the Medicare Drug Price 
Negotiation Program, which has requirements for 
the number of years a drug has been on the market 
before it is eligible to be selected for negotiation, 
under the GUARD Model, if a drug meets the 
criteria, it would be included and potentially be 
subject to a rebate regardless of how long it has 
been on the market.

Application (NDA) or Biologics License application

2025 due to cost.
86
All of this suggests 
that Part D enrollees with certain health 
conditions and particularly those who 
take certain brand-name drugs or 
biologics may still experience high out- 
of-pocket spending. 
In addition to out-of-pocket costs for 
their prescription drugs, enrollees also 
pay monthly premiums for their Part D 
coverage, which may impact whether a 
Medicare beneficiary elects to enroll in 
a Part D plan. Previous ASPE research 
finds that in 2019, about 5.7 million 
Medicare beneficiaries did not have any 
prescription drug coverage.
87
From 2024 
to 2025, MedPAC found a decrease in 
the average premiums paid by enrollees, 
from $27 to $23. This decline is largely 
attributed to the IRA’s 6 percent cap on 
base beneficiary premiums, which 
remains in effect through 2029 and to 
the voluntary Part D Premium 
Stabilization Demonstration. This 
demonstration, which began in 2024 for 
calendar year 2025, is testing an 
approach to stabilize the year-over-year 
changes in premiums for standalone 
PDPs during the implementation of the 
Part D redesign.
88
MedPAC analysis 
shows that average monthly premiums 
are higher for standalone PDPs than 
MA–PD plans. This is driven in part by 
the additional tools and flexibilities 
available to MA–PD plans (for example, 
MA–PD sponsors that submit MA bids 
that are below the applicable benchmark 
can use MA rebates to reduce Part D 
premiums) compared to PDPs.
89
 
E. Rationale and Need for GUARD 
Model Test 
Within the United States, the prices of 
certain types of drugs have been 
increasing over time, which impacts 
spending in Part D and affordability of 
Part D coverage for Medicare 
beneficiaries. Brand-name drugs and 
biologics, in particular, represent a large 
portion of Part D spending in spite of 
the fact that generic drugs have a higher 
volume of use.
90 91
The IRA addresses 
certain high drug costs under Part D. 
However, the IRA provisions— 
specifically the Drug Price Negotiation 
Program—focuses on a small set of 
drugs and only after they are available 
in the market for a period of time. The 
current Part D Inflation Rebate Program 
requires manufacturers to pay a rebate 
for certain drugs based on price changes 
over time within the United States. 
While this approach is useful for 
curbing post-launch increases in drug 
prices, the Part D Inflation Rebate 
Program does not address the high 
launch prices of drugs, which continue 
to increase over time and contribute to 
high Medicare drug spending. One way 
to address high Part D spending is to 
test a change in the IRA’s Part D 
inflation rebate calculation by using a 
benchmark that takes into account drug 
pricing information from economically 
comparable countries. The benchmark 
could then be subtracted from a net 
price that uses the manufacturer’s 
starting point for negotiations (for 
example, the publicly available list 
price); manufacturer rebates and 
discounts could be netted from this 
figure (to give credit to manufacturers 
for rebates that have been paid). This 
approach is different from the current 
Part D Inflation Rebate Program, which 
compares each applicable drug’s current 
year price (based on the applicability 
period as described previously in this 
Section of the proposed rule) to the 
inflation adjusted benchmark period 
price, and in so doing, evaluates 
changes in prices within the United States over time.
92
 
Under the CMS Innovation Center’s 
statutory authority under section 1115A 
of the Act, we propose to address this 
key issue of persistent high domestic 
Medicare drug spending for certain 
drugs and biologics through the GUARD 
Model, which tests changes to the Part 
D inflation rebate provision by 
implementing an innovative alternative 
payment method for the purpose of 
reducing Medicare drug spending and 
preserving or improving quality of care 
for Part D enrollees. 
III. Summary Provisions Proposed in 
the Guard Model 
The proposed GUARD Model would 
test changes to the Part D Inflation 
Rebate Program, specifically testing 
whether an alternative for the Part D 
inflation rebate calculation for certain 
drugs and biological products would 
reduce program spending for Medicare 
and taxpayers while preserving or 
enhancing the quality of care furnished 
to Medicare beneficiaries. The proposed 
model includes the following major 
provisions: 
€The GUARD Model would include a subset of Part D rebatable drugs that 
are included in the Part D Inflation 
Rebate Program. Specifically, the 
GUARD Model would include sole- 
source drugs and sole-source biological 
products that are in the following 
specific therapeutic categories: 
Analgesics; Anticonvulsants; 
Antidepressants; Antimigraine Agents; 
Antineoplastics; Antipsychotics; 
Antivirals; Bipolar Agents; Blood 
Glucose Regulators; Cardiovascular 
Agents; Central Nervous System Agents; 
Gastrointestinal Agents; Genetic or 
Enzyme or Protein Disorder: 
Replacement or Modifiers or Treatment; 
Immunological Agents; Metabolic Bone 
Disease Agents; Ophthalmic Agents; and 
Respiratory Tract/Pulmonary Agents. 
The GUARD Model would exclude (1) 
generics and biosimilar biological 
products; (2) sole-source drugs or sole- 
source biological products with annual 
application-level
93
total gross covered 
drug costs below the GUARD minimum 
spend threshold; and (3) drugs that are 
subject to a maximum fair price (MFP), 
during the price applicability period. 
For a more detailed discussion, see 
section IV.B. of this proposed rule. 
€The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) proposes in 
section IV.D. of this proposed rule that 
manufacturers of ‘‘Part D rebatable 
drugs,’’ as defined in section 1927(k)(5) 
of the Act and 42 CFR 428.20, that 
receive a Part D inflation rebate report 
that includes a GUARD Model drug for 
an applicable period that overlaps with 
the GUARD Model performance period

an international product must have an active 
ingredient, route of administration, dosage form, 
and strength that aligns with that of the GUARD 
Model drug. 
would be required to participate in the 
GUARD Model. 
€CMS proposes in section IV.E. of this proposed rule that the GUARD 
Model would select reference countries 
that are economically comparable to the 
United States. Reference countries must 
meet the following criteria: they must be 
a part of the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD), 
have a minimum of 60 percent of the 
United States’s purchasing power parity 
(PPP)-adjusted per capita gross domestic 
product (GDP), and a minimum $400 
billion (PPP)-adjusted aggregate GDP. 
The reference countries that meet these 
criteria and are therefore proposed to be 
selected for the model are the following: 
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, 
Czech Republic, Denmark, France, 
Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, 
the Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the 
United Kingdom. 
€As part of the GUARD Model, CMS proposes to test two approaches to 
calculating the GUARD Model 
international benchmark: the default 
international benchmark (also referred 
to as the Method I benchmark) and the 
updated international benchmark (also 
referred to as the Method II benchmark). 
€For each GUARD Model drug for which data on international drug 
pricing in reference countries are 
available, CMS would calculate the 
GUARD Model default international 
benchmark. The GUARD Model default 
international benchmark for each 
GUARD Model drug would be identified 
as the lowest country-level average price 
among the set of average prices for each 
reference country, adjusted by the 
country-specific GDP based on PPP 
(hereafter, ‘‘GDP (PPP)’’) adjuster, where 
an international product that is part of 
a GUARD Model drug’s set of 
international analogs
94
is sold. Please 
see section IV.G. of the proposed rule. 
€CMS would provide manufacturers with the option to submit international 
drug net pricing data for the set of 
reference countries where international 
products that are part of a GUARD 
Model drug’s set of international 
analogs are sold, including the across- 
country average net price. This 
submitted across-country average net 
price accounts for country-specific 
differences using a GDP (PPP) adjuster; 
if the data submitted is determined to be 
an applicable submission, it would 
become the GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark. Please see 
section IV.F. of this proposed rule. 
€CMS would determine a GUARD Model applicable international 
benchmark for each GUARD Model drug 
that would be the greater of the GUARD 
Model default international benchmark 
and the GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark, unless there is 
only a GUARD Model default 
international benchmark. If there is only 
a GUARD Model default international 
benchmark, it would become the 
applicable international benchmark. 
Please see section IV.G. of this proposed 
rule. 
€CMS would use this information to test an alternative inflation rebate 
payment calculation to determine 
whether manufacturers owe a GUARD 
Model rebate payment. The alternative 
inflation rebate calculation tested under 
the GUARD Model would compare a 
Medicare net price against the 
applicable international benchmark. 
Please see section IV.H. of this proposed 
rule. 
€The GUARD Model would require manufacturers to pay a GUARD Model 
rebate payment if the Medicare net price 
is greater than the GUARD Model 
applicable international benchmark for 
a GUARD Model drug. The Medicare net 
price would be calculated by subtracting 
manufacturer rebates (obtained from 
direct and indirect remuneration (DIR)) 
and discounts (under the Manufacturer 
Discount Program) from the wholesale 
acquisition cost (WAC) of the GUARD 
Model drug. Please see section IV.H. of 
this proposed rule. 
€The total GUARD Model rebate amount would be equal to the product 
of the per unit GUARD Model rebate 
amount for such GUARD Model drug for 
the performance year and the total 
number of units of the GUARD Model 
drug dispensed under Part D and 
covered by Part D plan sponsors in the 
GUARD Model geographic areas for the 
performance year. Please see section 
IV.H. of this proposed rule. 
€When the per unit GUARD Model rebate exceeds the per unit Part D 
inflation rebate amount, CMS would 
waive the rebate amount described in 
section 1860D–14B(b) of the Act and 
instead apply the GUARD Model rebate 
amount. The GUARD Model rebate 
payment would be deposited into the 
Medicare Prescription Drug Account in 
the Federal Supplementary Medical 
Insurance Trust Fund. 
€The evaluation would examine the main outcome, Medicare net spending, 
as well as additional outcomes of the 
GUARD Model, including the ways in 
which Part D plan benefits may change 
for GUARD Model drugs and whether 
and to what extent there are impacts on 
beneficiary cost sharing for GUARD 
Model drugs. 
IV. Detailed Description of Provisions 
in the Proposed Guard Model 
In this Section, CMS proposes our 
policies for testing and implementing 
the GUARD Model, including model- 
specific definitions and the general 
framework for implementation of the 
GUARD Model. The proposed model- 
specific terms are described in 
applicable Sections of this proposed 
rule. We propose to codify these model- 
specific terms at proposed 42 CFR part 
514. In addition, for purposes of this 
proposed rule and the proposed GUARD 
Model, we propose that the following 
terms would have the same meaning as 
set forth in 42 CFR 428.20: ‘‘applicable 
period’’; ‘‘Consumer Price Index for All 
Urban Consumers’’ (CPI–U); ‘‘applicable 
threshold’’; ‘‘average manufacturer 
price’’ (AMP); ‘‘manufacturer’’; 
‘‘national drug code’’ (NDC) ; ‘‘Part D 
rebatable drug’’; and ‘‘unit.’’ We also 
propose that ‘‘covered Part D drug’’ has 
the same meaning as set forth in 42 CFR 
423.100, and ‘‘line extension’’ has the 
same meaning as set forth in 42 CFR 
428.200. 
The remaining sections of this 
proposed rule are organized as follows: 
In section IV.A. of this proposed rule, 
we describe the proposed model 
performance and test period. In section 
IV.B. of this proposed rule, we present 
the Part D covered drugs that would be 
included in the GUARD Model. In 
section IV.C. of this proposed rule, we 
present the model test design, 
geographic selection, and beneficiary 
population that would be included in 
the GUARD Model. In section IV.D. of 
this proposed rule, we present the 
GUARD Model participants, including 
the requirement that participation is 
mandatory as well as requirements for 
participants during the GUARD Model 
performance period and after the ending 
of the performance period. In section 
IV.E. of this proposed rule, we present 
the existing international drug pricing 
data that CMS proposes to use to 
generate the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark as well as 
CMS’ proposed data sources and 
methods to identify the reference 
countries for the GUARD Model. In 
section IV.F. of this proposed rule, we 
present the option for manufacturers to 
submit international drug net pricing 
data, if they choose to do so; the 
requirements for such data submission; 
and the process to elect this option if 
preferred for the purpose of determining 
the updated international benchmark. In

GUARD Model applicable international 
benchmark based on the set of reference 
countries, including the default 
international benchmark and the 
updated international benchmark 
(which only applies if the manufacturer 
elects to submit international drug net 
pricing data, and it is deemed 
applicable by CMS). In section IV.H. of 
this proposed rule, we propose the 
methods to determine the GUARD 
Model rebate payment, including the 
data inputs and the calculation steps for 
the GUARD rebate payment amount. 
Section IV.I. of this proposed rule 
presents the proposals for reports of 
rebate amounts and timing of reports for 
GUARD Model participants. In section 
IV.J. of this proposed rule, we present 
the proposed reconciliation process for 
a GUARD rebate payment and the 
suggestion of error process. In section 
IV.K. of this proposed rule, we present 
the enforcement mechanisms that 
would be used to ensure manufacturer 
payment of rebates are paid in a timely 
manner. Section IV.L. of this proposed 
rule presents the proposed quality and 
monitoring strategy for the GUARD 
Model, and section IV.M. of this 
proposed rule presents the proposed 
beneficiary protections and compliance 
related activities that CMS would 
require under the GUARD Model. 
Section IV.N. of this proposed rule 
presents the GUARD Model’s 
interaction and coordination with other 
models and programs and CMS’ 
approach for taking these into account. 
Section IV.O. of this proposed rule 
presents the proposed evaluation 
approach for the GUARD Model, 
including the key outcomes that would 
be examined. Section IV.P. of this 
proposed rule presents information on 
the limitations on review that apply to 
CMS Innovation Center Models, 
including the GUARD Model. Section 
IV.Q. of this proposed rule presents 
program waivers that CMS proposes to 
apply to the GUARD Model. Section 
IV.R. of this proposed rule denotes that 
the GUARD Model and its provisions 
are severable from other CMS programs. 
Section IV.S. of this proposed rule 
presents information on the termination 
of the GUARD Model. Section IV.T. of 
this proposed rule presents the process 
for response to comments on this 
proposed rule. 
A. Proposed Model Performance and 
Test Period 
CMS is proposing in § 514.1(c) that 
the GUARD Model would have a 7-year 
overall test period, which would consist 
of 5 performance years, during which 
GUARD Model rebate payments would 
apply, and 7 payment years during 
which CMS calculates, invoices, 
collects, and reconciles the GUARD 
Model rebates for a performance year, 
unless the model is terminated sooner, 
in accordance with proposed 
§ 514.910(a). 
In § 514.5, we propose to define 
‘‘payment year’’ as a 12-month period 
beginning on January 1 and ending on 
December 31 during the GUARD Model 
test period. As such, we propose to 
define ‘‘GUARD Model payment 
period’’ as the 7-year period beginning 
on January 1, 2027 through December 
31, 2033, as specified in § 514.1(c). We 
propose a 7-year payment period to 
allow for sufficient time for payments to 
be invoiced and collected after the end 
of the 5 performance years of the 
GUARD Model. 
In § 514.5, we propose to define the 
‘‘GUARD Model performance period’’ as 
the 5-year period, beginning on January 
1, 2027, through December 31, 2031, as 
specified in § 514.1(c). We propose to 
define at § 514.5, the ‘‘performance 
year’’ (PY) as the 12-month period 
beginning on January 1st and ending on 
December 31st during the GUARD 
Model performance period, and in 
alignment with the GUARD Model 
duration as specified in § 514.1(c). We 
propose to utilize a 5-year performance 
period because it would allow for 
sufficient time and duration to test an 
alternative to the Part D inflation rebate 
calculation under the Medicare Part D 
Inflation Rebate Program, using the 
applicable international benchmark 
price, as described in section IV.G. of 
this proposed rule, and for the purpose 
of understanding the impacts of the 
GUARD Model. A 5-year performance 
period would allow CMS to examine 
whether the Model reduces 
expenditures under Part D and 
maintains or improves quality of care 
for Part D enrollees; that is, whether the 
GUARD Model—(1) maintains spending 
while improving quality; (2) maintains 
quality while reducing spending; or (3) 
reduces spending and improves quality. 
We believe this is sufficient time to 
evaluate the way the GUARD Model 
impacts Medicare net spending for the 
GUARD Model drugs. Within this time 
horizon, we would also be able to 
observe short-, intermediate-, and some 
long-term impacts of the GUARD Model, 
such as manufacturer and other 
stakeholder responses as well as 
changes in cost sharing for beneficiaries. 
See section IV.L. of this proposed rule 
for the quality and monitoring approach 
and section IV.O. of this proposed rule 
for the evaluation strategy of the 
GUARD Model. 
CMS proposes in § 514.110(c) that it 
would be necessary to continue GUARD 
Model processes for payment beyond 
the end of the GUARD Model 
performance period and reconciliation 
activities beyond the GUARD Model 
payment period. CMS believes the 
reconciliation activities beyond the end 
of the GUARD Model payment period 
would pose minimal burden to 
manufacturers. Examples of 
reconciliation activities that could take 
place after the end of the GUARD Model 
payment period are responses to 
reconciliation reports, suggestion of 
error processes, and payment of any 
reconciled rebate amounts due or owed. 
B. GUARD Model Drugs 
1. Proposed Identification of GUARD 
Model Drugs 
From among the Part D rebatable 
drugs included in the Part D Inflation 
Rebate Program, as defined in 42 CFR 
428.20 and identified in 42 CFR 
428.101, CMS proposes at § 514.120(a) 
that GUARD Model drugs would be 
defined as sole-source drugs and 
biological products identified at the 
NDC–9 level, except those that meet 
certain exclusions, as described in 
section III.B.2. of this proposed rule. 
This means that for every performance 
year, only sole-source drugs and sole- 
source biological products included in 
the Part D Inflation Rebate Program 
would be considered for the GUARD 
Model. 
CMS proposes at § 514.120(a) that 
identification of drugs and biological 
products would be at the NDC–9 level 
because this is the same unique 
prescription drug product number that 
is used to identify a Part D rebatable 
drug in accordance with 42 CFR 428.20 
and 428.101. We would use the NDC– 
9 level at which to identify the drugs in 
the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug 
Event (PDE) data. At § 514.5 CMS 
defines ‘‘PDE data’’ to mean records 
submitted by a Part D plan to CMS each 
time a beneficiary fills a prescription 
under Medicare Part D. A PDE record is 
data summarizing the final adjudication 
of a Part D dispensing event that is 
reported to CMS by the Part D sponsor 
using a CMS-defined file layout. 
We propose at § 514.100 that for the 
purposes of the GUARD Model test, a 
‘‘sole-source drug’’ will be defined as a 
drug approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) under a New 
Drug Application (NDA) under section 
505 of the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act 
(FD&C Act) for which there are no

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360350 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules 95
At § 514.5 we define ‘‘generic’’ to mean, for the 
United States, a marketed drug submitted in an 
ANDA and approved under an ANDA under section 
505(j) of the FD&C Act. 
96
At § 514.5 we define ‘‘biosimilar biological 
product’’ to mean, for the United States, a marketed 
biological product submitted in a BLA under 
section 351(k) of the PHS Act. 
97
It is possible for there to be an unbranded 
biological product derived from a biosimilar 
biological product, which would have been 
licensed under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. Given 
that at § 514.120 CMS proposes to exclude generics 
and biosimilar biological products and that 
biosimilar biological products are defined at § 514.5 
as those licensed under section 351(k), it follows 
that these specific unbranded biological products 
would be excluded from the GUARD Model.

generic(s),

as defined at § 514.5, rated 
as therapeutically equivalent (under the 
FDA’s most recent publication of 
‘‘Approved Drug Products with 
Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations’’). 
The generic rated as therapeutically 
equivalent to the drug must be 
recognized as a therapeutic equivalent 
in the FDA’s Orange Book and be 
identified as marketed in the FDA’s 
NDC Directory. From this definition, it 
follows that a multi-source drug, which 
is a drug with at least one 
therapeutically equivalent generic 
approved and marketed, is not a 
GUARD Model drug. 
We propose at § 514.100 that a ‘‘sole- 
source biological product,’’ for purposes 
of the GUARD Model test, will be 
defined as a biological product licensed 
by the FDA under a Biologics License 
Application (BLA) under section 351(a) 
of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act 
that is not the reference biological 
product, as defined at 42 U.S.C. 
262(i)(4), for a biosimilar biological 
product licensed by FDA in a BLA 
under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. 
The biosimilar biological product
96
 
must have the biological product as its 
reference product as defined at 42 
U.S.C. 262(i)(4) in the FDA’s Purple 
Book and be identified as marketed in 
the FDA’s NDC Directory. From this 
definition, it follows that a multi-source 
biological product, which is a biological 
product with at least one biosimilar 
biological product licensed and 
marketed that has said biological 
product as their reference product, is 
not a GUARD Model drug. 
At the time of evaluating inclusion of 
a drug into the GUARD Model (based on 
being sole-source drugs or biological 
products) for each performance year, 
CMS would use the FDA’s NDC 
Directory, including historical 
information from NDC Directory files 
such as discontinued, delisted, and 
expired listings, provided by the FDA or 
published on the FDA website to 
identify whether the generic or 
biosimilar biological products are being 
sold or marketed for purposes of the 
GUARD Model. Additionally, CMS 
proposes at § 514.120(a) that should a 
sole-source drug or sole-source 
biological product become multi-source 
at any point during a performance year, 
it would only be subject to the GUARD 
Model for the period of the performance 
year during which it was sole-source. 
CMS recognizes that based on the 
definitions of sole-source previously 
described, authorized generics and 
unbranded biological products could 
potentially be GUARD Model drugs. 
Authorized generics are drugs sold 
without their brand name by the 
original manufacturer or a third party 
under the NDA of the original drug. 
Unbranded biological products are 
biological products sold without their 
brand name by the original 
manufacturer or a third party licensed 
by the BLA 351(a) of the original 
biological product.
97
Since both 
authorized generics and unbranded 
biological products are, directly or 
indirectly, sponsored by the original 
pharmaceutical drug manufacturer, 
CMS believes that if their NDC–9 is 
included in the Part D Inflation Rebate 
Program, then subject to the exclusions 
described in section III.B.2. of this 
proposed rule, they would be included 
in the GUARD Model. 
Under the proposed policies, the 
GUARD Model drugs would consist of 
a subset of Part D rebatable drugs. CMS 
believes that focusing the GUARD 
Model test on a subset of the Part D 
rebatable drugs, rather than all Part D 
rebatable drugs, would allow CMS to 
understand the GUARD Model’s 
impacts with a smaller set of drugs. For 
example, testing the GUARD Model on 
a select subset of drugs would allow 
CMS to understand how the Part D plan 
market would respond to the alternative 
rebate payment methodology tested 
under the GUARD Model. In 
§ 514.120(a), we propose sole-source 
drugs and sole-source biological 
products for inclusion in the GUARD 
Model because generally, these drugs 
face similar market dynamics. By 
including only sole-source drugs and 
sole-source biological products in the 
GUARD Model, we expect that learnings 
from the test would not be influenced 
by the very different market dynamics 
that exist for other types of drugs 
included in the Part D Inflation Rebate 
program. 
When determining the scope of drugs 
included in our proposal for the GUARD 
Model, we considered two key 
characteristics related to market 
dynamics for sole-source drugs and 
sole-source biological products. First, 
sole-source drugs and sole-source 
biological products experience different 
competitive forces than multi-source 
drugs and multi-source biological 
products. The entry of a generic drug, 
which changes a sole-source drug into a 
multi-source one, has been shown to 
shift utilization from the original drug to 
the generic by 75 percent within a 
year,
98
with prices falling on average by 
more than half for the sole-source 
drug.
99 100
Biosimilar biological product 
entry, which changes a sole-source 
biological product into a multi-source 
biological product, has been shown to 
shift utilization from the original 
biological product to the biosimilar 
biological product by 40 percent within 
a year, with prices falling by up to 25 
percent.
101
These shifts and prices in 
multi-source drug
102
and multi-source 
biological product
103
markets varies by 
market size, product form, therapeutic 
area, distribution channel, and other 
idiosyncratic characteristics. Therefore, 
by only including sole-source drugs and 
sole-source biological products, the 
GUARD Model test can focus on 
understanding the impacts on these 
types of drugs without having to 
account for confounding factors that 
may arise due to the entry of generics 
or biosimilars, which fundamentally 
alters market dynamics.
104
 
Second, pharmaceutical drug 
manufacturer rebates and discounts are 
significantly different for sole-source

and multi-source drugs and biological 
products. Although there are many 
factors that influence the net price of a 
drug, which is exclusive of rebates, 
discounts, and other price concessions, 
in general (though there are exceptions), 
drugs that face more limited 
competition (such as sole-source drugs 
and sole-source biological products) 
maintain higher net prices than drugs 
that have market competition (such as 
multi-source drugs and multi-source 
biological products).
105 106 107
This 
occurs for multiple reasons, but one 
reason is due to the specific features of 
the sole-source drug market. Part D plan 
sponsors or their pharmacy benefit 
managers (PBMs) negotiate with 
pharmaceutical drug manufactures for 
rebates in exchange for favorable 
formulary placement, which includes 
assigning drugs into tiers with different 
cost sharing requirements (for example, 
coinsurance vs. copayment); prior 
authorization requirements; utilization 
management approaches, and other 
aspects. Although Part D plan sponsors 
or their PBMs negotiate with 
pharmaceutical drug manufactures for 
formulary placement for both sole- 
source drugs and sole-source biological 
products as well as multi-source drugs 
and biological products, negotiation is 
fundamentally different due to the 
different characteristics of these types of 
drugs. 
These two key differences illustrate 
how market dynamics vary between 
sole-source drugs and biological 
products and multi-source drugs and 
biological products, and the way these 
differences directly impact their pricing 
dynamics. CMS believes that the focus 
of the GUARD Model on sole-source 
drugs and sole-source biological 
products mitigates the potential 
confounding factors that would arise if 
the full set of Part D rebatable drugs 
were included in the GUARD Model 
test. 
Further, CMS proposes in § 514.120(a) 
to limit the subset of sole-source drugs 
and sole-source biological products to 
those classified by the United States 
Pharmacopeia (USP) Drug Classification 
as belonging to certain categories 
selected by CMS. The categories 
selected by CMS, hereinafter referred to 
as ‘‘USP selected categories’’ are 
proposed at § 514.120(e) and include the 
specific categories from the USP Drug 
Classification that correspond to all of 
the Part D protected classes and 
additional categories based on several 
considerations. The primary reasons for 
selection of these categories are that 
Medicare beneficiaries taking these 
drugs have conditions for which deficits 
in care exist and they represent a 
meaningful amount of spending under 
Part D. 
a. Approach for Selecting Categories 
From the United States Pharmacopeia 
Under the Medicare Prescription 
Drug, Improvement, and Modernization 
Act of 2003, Public Law 108–173, 117 
Stat. 2066 (2003), section 1860D– 
4(b)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act, the USP is 
required to develop and revise the 
Medicare Model Guidelines, which is a 
classification system used for the 
purpose of supporting Part D formulary 
development and submission. The 
Medicare Model Guidelines include a 
list of categories and classes that may be 
used by prescription drug plans; USP 
revises them on a continuous basis 
based on changes in therapeutic uses of 
covered Part D drugs and the additions 
of new covered Part D drugs.
108
 
CMS proposes at § 514.120(d) to use 
the ‘category’ field of the USP Drug 
Classification because CMS believes this 
field is sufficient to identify drugs and 
biological products for conditions where 
Medicare beneficiaries may experience 
deficits of care, while allowing for 
differences in mechanism of action and 
molecular or biological targets for 
products that treat the same therapeutic 
area. We recognize that a drug or 
biological product may be listed in more 
than one USP category. We propose at 
§ 514.120(d) that as long as one of the 
categories selected for inclusion in the 
GUARD Model applies to the drug or 
biological product, it will be considered 
to have met this criterion and would be 
included in the GUARD Model. 
CMS proposes at § 514.120(d) to 
identify the Part D rebatable drugs 
classified as belonging to one of the 
categories listed later in this Section of 
this proposed rule using their

CMS proposes at § 514.120(a) that a 
drug or biological product whose listed 
USP categories include at least one of 
the following USP selected categories 
(as defined at § 514.120(e)) would be 
included in the GUARD Model if they 
meet all other inclusion criteria and 
limited to the exclusion criteria 
proposed at § 514.120(c): Analgesics; 
Anticonvulsants; Antidepressants; 
Antimigraine Agents; Antineoplastics; 
Antipsychotics; Antivirals; Bipolar 
Agents; Blood Glucose Regulators; 
Cardiovascular Agents; Central Nervous 
System Agents; Gastrointestinal Agents; 
Genetic or Enzyme or Protein Disorder: 
Replacement or Modifiers or Treatment; 
Immunological Agents; Metabolic Bone 
Disease Agents; Ophthalmic Agents; and 
Respiratory Tract/Pulmonary Agents. 
The proposed list of USP categories 
includes categories that correspond to 
the six Medicare Protected Classes 
(anticonvulsants, antidepressants, 
antineoplastics, antipsychotics, 
antiretrovirals, and 
immunosuppressants) identified by 
CMS as those for which ‘‘all or 
substantially all’’ drugs must be covered 
by Part D plans.
112
The USP categories 
that correspond to the Medicare 
Protected Classes are Anticonvulsants, 
Antidepressants, Antineoplastics, 
Antipsychotics, Antivirals, Bipolar 
Agents, and Immunological Agents, as 
defined at § 514.5. The Bipolar Agents 
USP category has significant overlap 
with the Medicare Protected Classes of 
antidepressants and antipsychotics; 
thus, CMS considers Bipolar Agents to 
correspond with the Medicare protected 
classes and this category would be 
included in the GUARD Model. These 
USP categories that correspond to the 
protected classes are included because 
of their relevance for vulnerable

beneficiaries that depend on these drugs 
for serious conditions. Except for 
Anticonvulsants, among the Part D 
rebatable sole-source drugs and sole- 
source biological products, all of the 
USP selected categories that correspond 
to Medicare protected classes have 2024 
total covered gross drug costs above $1 
billion.
113
The top three spending 
categories that correspond to Medicare 
Protected Classes in 2024 are 
Immunological Agents, Antineoplastics, 
and Antivirals; for these categories, 
among Part D rebatable sole-source 
drugs and sole-source biological 
products, the total covered drug costs 
are $32, $30, and $10 billion, 
respectively. 
The proposed list also includes 
additional categories that correspond to 
drugs that are used for conditions for 
which Medicare beneficiaries 
experience deficits of care and that are 
within the top spending categories for 
the Part D Inflation Rebate Program 
based on previous spending trends. The 
additional USP selected categories (as 
defined at § 514.120(e)) are Analgesics; 
Antimigraine Agents; Blood Glucose 
Regulators; Cardiovascular Agents; 
Central Nervous System Agents; 
Gastrointestinal Agents; Genetic or 
Enzyme or Protein Disorder: 
Replacement or Modifiers or Treatment; 
Metabolic Bone Disease Agents; 
Ophthalmic Agents; and Respiratory 
Tract/Pulmonary Agents. Among the 
Part D rebatable sole-source drugs and 
sole-source biological products, in 2024, 
all of these USP selected categories have 
total covered gross drug costs above $1 
billion.
114
The top two spending 
categories in 2024 were Blood Glucose 
Regulators and Respiratory Tract/ 
Pulmonary Agents. 
CMS proposes at § 514.120(d) that 
once CMS has identified the drug or 
biological product’s category, it should 
remain in that category for the entire 
GUARD Model performance period. 
Accordingly, drugs or biological 
products will retain their category, 
while newly added drugs or biological 
products will retain the category 
assigned at the time of their 
identification, based on the USP 
Medicare Model Guidelines available at 
the time. Additionally, as defined at 
§ 514.5, any change to the definition of 
Medicare Protected Classes in Chapter 6 
section 30.2.5 from the Medicare 
Prescription Drug Benefit Manual would 
be carried over. 
b. Addressing Deficits of Care Among 
Part D Enrollees 
We propose these categories partly 
because Part D enrollees who take these 
drugs have conditions for which deficits 
of care are documented. For example, 
Part D beneficiaries who have 
immunological diseases (and therefore 
may take immunological agents), 
endocrine diseases (and therefore may 
take blood glucose regulators and 
metabolic bone disease agents), 
neurological diseases (and therefore 
may take analgesics, anticonvulsants, 
antimigraine agents, central nervous 
system agents) and chronic diseases 
(and therefore may take cardiovascular 
agents, gastrointestinal agents, 
respiratory tract and pulmonary agents), 
may experience affordability challenges 
related to their treatment.
115 116 117
There 
is evidence that patients with 
autoimmune diseases such as 
rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus 
erythematosus, neurological disease 
such as multiple sclerosis and 
myasthenia gravis, and endocrine 
diseases such as diabetes mellitus, 
continue to experience financial 
burden.
118 119 120
 
Additionally, CMS analysis of the 
Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey 
(MCBS) finds that nine percent of 
Medicare beneficiaries reported that 
they decided not to fill a prescription in 2025 due to cost.
121
Financial distress 
associated with cost coping behaviors, 
such as rationing or skipping medicines 
or delaying care that could worsen 
health outcomes continues to raise 
concerns for providers treating a range 
of conditions. This includes, for 
example, providers treating 
autoimmune diseases such as systemic 
lupus erythematosus
122
and 
neuromyelitis optical spectrum 
disorder,
123
endocrine diseases such as 
diabetes mellitus,
124
neurological 
diseases such as multiple sclerosis
125 126
 
and myasthenia gravis,
127
and chronic 
diseases such as cardiovascular 
diseases
128 129
and inflammatory bowel 
disease.

Although the GUARD Model does not 
directly impact Part D enrollees’ out-of- 
pocket costs for these drugs, we believe 
the GUARD Model has the capacity to 
address deficits of care experienced by 
the populations who take the drugs that 
fall within these categories. The GUARD 
Model test requires a GUARD Model

rebate payment, as described in Section 
IV.H. of this proposed rule, if a GUARD 
Model drug’s Medicare net price is 
greater than an international 
benchmark. It is possible that in 
response to the alternative payment 
strategy tested under the model, 
manufacturers reduce their net price for 
a given drug, for instance by reducing 
launch prices for drugs that are likely to 
become GUARD Model drugs. If 
manufacturers decrease launch prices 
for GUARD Model drugs for the purpose 
of reducing their liability under the 
GUARD Model, it may have cascading 
effects. For example, such a response 
may benefit Part D plans, who may then 
change their benefit design and offerings 
for Part D plan enrollees and potentially 
reduce cost sharing for the drugs 
included in the GUARD Model. 
It is also possible manufacturers 
respond to the GUARD Model by 
reducing the list prices of the drugs 
included in the model. A reduction of 
list prices would reduce a 
manufacturer’s rebate liability under the 
GUARD Model. Given that the list price 
of drugs is used as a starting point for 
negotiations in the pharmaceutical drug 
supply chain, it is possible that a 
reduction in list prices may lead to a 
reduction in the out-of-pocket costs paid 
by Part D enrollees who take these 
drugs, particularly if the out-of-pocket 
cost is based on coinsurance instead of 
a flat copayment. 
In sum, CMS proposes at § 514.5 that 
‘‘GUARD Model drug’’ means, subject to 
the exclusions set forth in § 514.120(c), 
a Part D rebatable drug, as set forth in 
section 1860D–14B(g)(1) of the Act and 
defined in 42 CFR 428.20 and 
determined in 42 CFR 428.101, that is 
a sole-source drug or sole-source 
biological product as defined in 
§ 514.100, has a USP category 
classification that includes at least one 
of the USP selected categories, as 
defined in § 514.120(e), and is 
identifiable by a unique NDC–9 for 
which a payment was made under 
Medicare Part D. This means that CMS 
proposes to limit the GUARD Model test 
to the subset of sole-source drug and 
sole-source biological products 
belonging to USP selected categories 
among the Part D rebatable drugs, with 
some exclusions. Focusing the GUARD 
Model test on sole-source drugs and 
source biological products allows the 
GUARD Model test to identify the 
impact of the model without having to 
consider and potentially adjust for the 
very different market dynamics between 
these different types of drugs. 
Additionally, selecting drugs in specific 
USP categories with deficits of care and 
high costs means the GUARD Model 
focuses on drugs with the greatest 
potential for savings for the Medicare 
program and Part D enrollees. Moreover, 
the proposed approach allows for 
testing of the GUARD Model on a 
smaller subset of Part D rebatable drugs, 
which would generate learnings and 
insights that can help CMS understand 
how stakeholders may respond, even for 
drugs that are not included in the 
GUARD Model. 
2. Proposed Exclusion of Certain Part D 
Rebatable Drugs 
CMS proposes in § 514.120(a) to test 
the GUARD Model with a subset of Part 
D rebatable drugs, specifically, sole- 
source drugs and sole-source biological 
products belonging to the proposed 
selected therapeutic USP categories.
131
 
CMS proposes to exclude from the 
GUARD Model, generics and biosimilar 
biological products. At § 514.5 we 
propose ‘‘generic’’ to mean, for the 
United States, a drug approved and 
marketed under an Abbreviated New 
Drug Application (ANDA) under section 
505(j) of the FD&C Act; and ‘‘biosimilar 
biological product’’ to mean, for the 
United States, a biological product 
approved and licensed under a BLA 
under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. 
Given that the only generics that are 
Part D rebatable are sole-source 
generics, another way of stating the 
exclusion is that sole-source generics 
and any (sole- or multi-source) 
biosimilar biological products are 
excluded from the GUARD Model. 
CMS proposes this exclusion because 
sole-source generics and biosimilar 
biological products experience very 
different market dynamics than sole- 
source drugs (the original drug product 
approved under an NDA)
132
and sole- 
source biological products (the original 
biological product licensed under 
section 351(a) of the PHS Act).
133
This 
is consistent with our proposed policy 
to only include sole-source drugs 
(which excludes multi-source drugs due 
to them having generics) and sole- 
source biological products (which 
excludes multi-source biological 
products due to them having biosimilar 
biological products). 
As explained in this Section 
previously, sole-source generics 
experience different market dynamics 
than sole-source original drugs. 
Specifically, their existence necessitates 
that patent protections on the original 
drugs have expired; their original 
counterparts may have ceased to be 
marketed (usually discontinued due to 
business reasons); they are typically at 
higher risk for disruptions in their 
supply; and they tend to be older 
drugs.
134 135
For instance, sole-source 
generics have been singled out by FDA 
via the Competitive Generic Therapies 
pathway (created under the FDA 
Reauthorization Act of 2017); this 
pathway seeks to facilitate approval of 
sole-source generics with the goal being 
to impact their market dynamics via 
increased competition. CMS believes 
that it does not strengthen the GUARD 
Model test to include sole-source 
generics in the model because of their 
specific market dynamics. 
Biosimilar biological products also 
experience different market dynamics 
compared to the original biological 
product. As stated earlier in this Section 
of this proposed rule, the entry of a 
biosimilar biological product results in 
a multi-source biological product 
market which results in competitive 
forces that shift consumption patterns, 
prices, and overall utilization of both 
the original biological product and other 
biosimilars (if they exist). As such, CMS 
proposes at § 514.120(c) that biosimilar 
biological products would be excluded 
from the GUARD Model. For sole-source 
biosimilar biological products, this 
would mean that the original biological 
product would have to no longer be 
marketed according to the FDA’s NDC 
Directory. At time of this writing, there 
is no clear case of a sole-source 
biosimilar biological product in the 
United States; however, there is also no 
reason to believe that sole-source 
biosimilar biological products would 
behave any differently from sole-source

While it is possible for an application to 
change sponsor, during or after approval, there is 
one responsible party (the sponsor) for an 
application at a time. Any shifts in application 
ownership are notified to FDA, thus reflected in 
Orange or Purple Book, and would require a new 
NDC–9 and NDC codes are manufacturer-specific.

For the applicable period beginning October 1, 
2022, the applicable threshold is equal to $100. For 
the applicable period beginning October 1, 2023, 
the applicable threshold is equal to $100 increased 
by the percentage increase in CPI–U for the 12- 
month period beginning October 1, 2023. For 
subsequent applicable periods, the applicable 
threshold is equal to the applicable threshold for 
the prior applicable period increased by the 
percentage increase in the CPI–U for the 12-month 
period beginning with October of the previous 
period. 
generics in the market. For a sole-source 
biosimilar biological product to exist, 
patent protections on the original 
product would had to have expired; 
their original biologic products may 
have been discontinued; and we would 
expect them to be older drugs. As such, 
CMS believes that inclusion of sole- 
source biosimilar biological products 
would not strengthen the GUARD 
Model test. 
CMS proposes at § 514.120(c) that the 
second exclusion would be based on 
whether a sole-source drug or biological 
product’s application-level total gross 
covered prescription drug costs are 
below the GUARD Model minimum 
spend threshold, as discussed below in 
this Section of this proposed rule. 
‘‘Application-level total gross covered 
prescription drug costs’’ is defined at 
§ 514.100 as the sum of total gross 
covered prescription drug costs, as 
defined in 42 CFR 428.100, from 
Medicare Part D PDE data for all 
rebatable Part D drugs belonging to the 
same FDA application. 
CMS believes that by using an 
application-level total gross covered 
prescription drug costs, the risk of 
gaming to keep a specific Part D 
rebatable drug below the threshold by, 
for example, applying for a new NDC– 
9 to reduce the total gross covered 
prescription drug spend of the original 
NDC–9 or by shifting formulary 
placement, is mitigated. At the same 
time, the approach considers total 
spending incurred by the Medicare 
Program on a GUARD Model drug by a 
manufacturer.
136
 
CMS proposes at § 514.100 that the 
‘‘GUARD minimum spend threshold’’ 
means for the performance year 
beginning on January 1, 2027, an 
amount equal to $69 million and for 
subsequent performance years, the 
minimum spend threshold is equal to 
the GUARD Model minimum spend 
threshold for the prior performance year 
increased by the percentage increase in 
the CPI–U
137
for the 12-month period 
beginning with January of the previous 
performance year, where a ‘‘subsequent 
performance year’’ means every 
performance year after the first. There 
are four, starting January 1 and ending 
on December 31 of 2028, 2029, 2030, 
and 2031, as defined at § 514.5. This 
means that for each subsequent 
performance year, the GUARD 
minimum spend threshold would 
increase with inflation. CMS would use 
PDE data to check whether a potential 
GUARD Model drug is excluded from 
the GUARD Model due to the minimum 
spend threshold. CMS proposes at 
§ 514.120(c) to examine PDE data for the 
application-level total gross covered 
prescription drug costs for the 
corresponding performance year. CMS 
proposes at § 514.120(c) that once a 
GUARD Model drug has exceeded the 
GUARD Model minimum spend 
threshold for a performance year during 
the GUARD Model performance period, 
they would no longer be subject to this 
exclusion for subsequent performance 
years. This means that a GUARD Model 
drug’s minimum spend would not be checked annually. 
CMS believes that setting a GUARD 
minimum spend threshold and 
comparing application-level total gross 
covered prescription drug costs against 
it reduces the risk of access-related 
challenges associated with the drug. In 
our analysis, we find that on average, 
across the 2024 Part D rebatable drugs 
that would be included in the GUARD 
Model if the model had been 
implemented in 2024
138
(using an 
application-level total gross covered 
drug cost above $69 million), the 
included drugs would be associated 
with approximately $188 million per 
drug in Part D spending.
139
Therefore, 
we believe applying a threshold of $69 
million that is adjusted for inflation 
annually thereafter means that 
manufacturers of GUARD Model drugs 
would have significant revenue from the 
Medicare Program and thus would 
likely remain in the Medicare program 
during the GUARD Model test. 
CMS also believes that a threshold of 
$69 million in the first performance year 
of the GUARD Model that is adjusted for 
inflation annually thereafter allows us 
to evaluate impacts to drugs above and 
below the threshold as part of the 
GUARD Model test. Specifically, 
applying the $69 million GUARD 
minimum threshold to 2024 Part D 
rebatable drugs that would be included 
if the model had been implemented in 
2024
140
results in 38 percent
141
of sole- 
source drugs and sole-source biological 
products included in the GUARD Model 
test. Among the 2024 Part D rebatable 
drugs
142
with an application-level total 
gross covered drug cost above $69 
million, each drug that would be 
included in the GUARD Model is 
associated with an average wholesale 
acquisition cost (WAC) of 
approximately $47; and each drug 
excluded is associated with an average 
WAC of approximately $14.
143
This 
analysis suggests that the GUARD 
minimum threshold, as applied to 2024 
Part D rebatable drugs, results in the 
GUARD Model test directed towards 
more expensive drugs and biological 
products whose average gross covered 
prescription drug costs are significantly 
higher than the GUARD minimum 
threshold. 
CMS believes that this threshold, in 
addition to the Part D Inflation Rebate 
Program applicable threshold
144
 
defined in 42 CFR 428.101, minimizes 
risk of disrupting access to drugs for 
several reasons. The GUARD minimum 
threshold supports the goal of having 
sufficient inclusion to adequately test 
the alternate payment strategy on a set 
of specific type of drugs (sole-source, 
high-expenditure drugs in specific USP 
selected categories). The Part D Inflation 
Rebate Program applicable threshold 
ensures that drugs with low per 
beneficiary gross drug costs which— 
given the low volume or price—could 
be affected disproportionately with a

change in payment strategy, are 
excluded from the GUARD Model 
because they are not Part D rebatable 
drugs. 
In § 514.120(c), CMS proposes, as a 
third exclusion, that when the Part D 
payment is based on a maximum fair 
price (MFP) (as defined in section 
1191(c)(3) of the Act), the Part D 
rebatable drug would be excluded from 
the GUARD Model. This means that 
drugs that are selected for the Medicare 
Drug Price Negotiation program (under 
Part E of Title XI of the Act (sections 
1191 through 1198)) would be excluded 
from the GUARD Model when the 
negotiated MFP is in effect. Specifically, 
this proposal would mean that a 
GUARD Model drug that is selected for 
negotiation of an MFP would be 
removed from the GUARD Model on the 
date that the MFP goes into effect. For 
example, because the prices of the drugs 
selected for initial price applicability 
year 2028 go into effect on January 1, 
2028, these set of drugs would not be 
included as GUARD Model drugs as of 
January 1, 2028. 
Should a drug no longer have a 
negotiated MFP in effect, but still be 
covered under Medicare, and to the 
extent it continues to fulfill the GUARD 
Model inclusion requirements, the drug 
would be included in the GUARD 
Model. CMS believes that excluding 
drugs when the Medicare Part D 
payment is based on a negotiated MFP 
is appropriate because these drugs are 
subject to different market dynamics 
within the United States, and we believe 
that including them could confound the 
GUARD Model test. As such, we do not 
propose a waiver under this model 
related to the Medicare Drug Price 
Negotiation Program. 
To maintain consistency with the 
definition of a Part D rebatable drug at 
42 CFR part 428, we propose at 
§ 514.120(e) that any changes to the 
definition of Part D rebatable drug at 42 
CFR part 428 would be automatically 
carried over to the definition of a 
GUARD Model drug at Part 514. 
In summary, for the purposes of the 
GUARD Model, CMS is defining a 
GUARD Model drug as proposed at 
§ 514.120(a) as a Part D rebatable sole- 
source drug or biological product 
identified based on the Part D Inflation 
Rebate Program and whose assigned 
USP categories are within one of the 
USP selected categories listed 
previously in this Section of the 
proposed rule with some exclusions. 
The proposed exclusions are: (1) sole- 
source generics and any biosimilar 
biological products; (2) sole-source 
drugs or sole-source biological products 
whose annual application-level total 
gross covered prescription drug costs 
are below the GUARD minimum spend 
threshold; and (3) sole-source drugs or 
sole-source biological products that are 
subject to an MFP during the price 
applicability period when the MFP is in 
effect. CMS believes that the proposed 
identification approach, along with the 
proposed exclusions covered in this 
Section of this proposed rule, would 
result in the inclusion of drugs and 
biological products that are used to treat 
a variety of conditions in the Part D 
enrollee population and are frequently 
sold at retail pharmacies, mail order 
pharmacies, and long-term care 
pharmacies. 
We invite public comment on our 
proposed approach for defining a 
GUARD Model drug as discussed in this 
proposed rule. We are seeking comment 
on the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
for GUARD Model drugs, including the 
GUARD minimum spend threshold and 
the proposal to include drugs in the 
GUARD Model if they are included in 
one of the USP selected categories 
included in the GUARD Model. 
3. Alternatives Considered 
CMS considered including multi- 
source drugs and biological products, 
sole-source generic drugs, and 
biosimilar biological products in the 
GUARD Model. However, CMS believes 
that their market dynamics and pricing 
behaviors, as discussed previously, 
would generate variability that would 
hinder precision in the evaluation of the 
alternate payment strategy tested under 
the GUARD Model. 
CMS also considered including 
additional USP categories beyond the 
ones proposed. Specifically, we 
considered including some additional 
categories based on their 2024 Part D 
total gross drug costs. For instance, CMS 
considered including the following 
additional USP categories due to each 
category having 2024 total covered gross 
drug costs for Part D rebatable sole- 
source drugs and sole-source biological 
products above $1 billion: Blood 
Products and Modifiers, Dermatological 
Agents, Antibacterials, Electrolytes/ 
Minerals/Metals/Vitamins, and 
Genitourinary Agents.
145
We also 
considered including all USP categories 
with Part D rebatable sole-source drugs 
and sole-source biological products that 
had any amount of Medicare Part D 
gross covered drug spending in 2024. 
This would result in the additional 
inclusion, besides the five USP 
categories already mentioned, of the 
following USP categories: 
Antiparasitics, Dental and Oral Agents, 
Otic Agents, Antimycobacterials, 
Contraceptives, and Antispasticity 
Agents. These additional six USP 
categories only amount to 1.6 percent of 
spending among Part D sole-source 
rebatable drugs and sole-source 
biological products. Finally, CMS also 
considered including in the USP 
selected categories list others such as 
Antidementia Agents, Inflammatory 
Bowel Disease Agents, and Skeletal 
Muscle Relaxants; and even considered 
not limiting inclusion for the GUARD 
Model by USP category and including 
all Part D rebatable drugs regardless of 
their USP category. However, CMS 
believes prioritizing the USP selected 
categories proposed at § 514.120(a)(2) is 
necessary because these categories 
represent drugs with high Part D gross 
drug spending and they treat conditions 
for populations that experience care 
deficits. We also considered excluding 
some of the proposed USP selected 
categories from the GUARD Model. For 
example, we considered excluding 
categories that correspond to the 
Medicare Protected Classes such as 
Anticonvulsants, or other categories 
such as Antimigraine Agents, 
Gastrointestinal Agents, and Metabolic 
Bone Disease Agents. However, we 
decided inclusion better serves the 
GUARD Model as the drugs in these 
categories are taken by populations that 
experience deficits of care. CMS seeks 
feedback on our approach, including 
whether additional categories should be 
included (and if so, which ones) or if 
there are any categories proposed that 
should be excluded. We also seek 
feedback on whether there are other 
approaches to identify the categories 
that we should consider. 
CMS considered using the total gross 
covered prescription drug costs for an 
NDC–9 instead of the application-level 
total gross covered prescription drug 
costs to identify the GUARD minimum 
spend threshold. However, we decided 
not to propose any thresholds at the 
NDC–9 level due to concerns regarding 
gaming, particularly the possibility of a 
new NDC–9 being introduced without a 
significant change in the drug. CMS also 
considered basing the minimum spend 
threshold on the total gross covered 
drug costs accrued over a calendar year 
for all Part D rebatable drugs with the 
same combination of certain 
characteristics. These characteristics 
could include all or some of active 
ingredient, route of administration, and 
dosage form. However, this would mean 
the total summed covered gross drug 
costs would not necessarily all

of October 1, 2025). Part D rebatable sole-source

correspond to the same manufacturer. 
Therefore, CMS does not believe this is 
the best approach for identifying the 
GUARD minimum spend threshold. 
Additionally, CMS considered 
determining the application-level or 
other aggregate levels of total covered 
gross costs for comparison with the 
GUARD minimum spend threshold 
using all Part D drugs not just those that 
qualify for the Part D Inflation Rebate 
Program. However, CMS believes that, 
given that the GUARD Model is testing 
an alternative calculation for the Part D 
inflation rebate calculation, it is 
appropriate to use the total covered 
gross costs from Part D rebatable drugs. 
CMS also considered evaluating 
whether a GUARD Model drug’s 
application-level total covered gross 
costs exceeds the GUARD Model 
minimum spend threshold for every 
performance year instead of only for the 
first performance year that the drug is 
being considered for inclusion as a 
GUARD Model drug. However, in the 
interest of stability and transparency 
regarding which drugs or biological 
products are GUARD Model drugs and 
given the modest 5-year duration of the 
GUARD Model performance period, 
CMS decided against this. CMS 
welcomes comments on the proposed 
approach and the alternatives 
considered. 
In proposing the GUARD minimum 
spend threshold, CMS considered all 
amounts between $24.4 and $127 
million since these amounts would 
result in 50 and 30 percent of Part D 
rebatable sole-source drugs and sole- 
source biological products after GUARD 
Model exclusions being included.
146
A 
GUARD minimum spend threshold 
lower than $24.4 million would result 
in the set of drugs and biological 
products included being too broad and 
CMS believes that it benefits the 
GUARD Model to focus the model test 
on a narrower set of drugs for conditions 
with observed deficits of care and those 
with higher costs. A GUARD minimum 
spend threshold higher than $127 
million would result in a set of drugs 
included too narrow; CMS believes this 
is an insufficient number of drugs and 
biological products for the GUARD 
Model test to be informative. 
CMS also considered not inflation 
adjusting the $69 million GUARD 
minimum threshold for each subsequent 
performance year after the first 
performance year; however, we believe 
that given the specific characteristics of 
the Part D program, inflation adjustment 
is necessary. 
Additionally, CMS considered 
beginning the GUARD Model with a 
limited set of drugs, ranging from only 
a set number of top spending drugs or 
starting with a small subset of drugs and 
phasing drugs in over time. Concerns 
around administrative burden, 
competitive disadvantages, operational 
complexity, and insufficient sample for 
evaluation of the model contributed to 
our decision not to employ these 
alternative approaches. CMS believes 
that beginning the GUARD Model with 
a subset of Part D rebatable drugs that 
allows for exclusions is a transparent, 
consistent, and clear approach that 
would provide sufficient opportunity 
for CMS to observe a wide range of 
manufacturer behavior with respect to 
drug pricing, increasing the 
generalizability of the evaluation 
findings. 
We believe the benefits of including a 
subset of Part D rebatable drugs in the 
GUARD Model with some exclusions, as 
discussed in this Section of this 
proposed rule, outweigh the benefits of 
initiating the GUARD Model with 
greater or fewer Part D rebatable drugs. 
We seek comments on our proposed 
approach, including the inclusion of 
only sole-source drugs and biological 
products from selected therapeutic 
areas;
147
the exclusion of sole-source 
generics and biosimilar biological 
products; the exclusion of drugs whose 
annual application-level total gross 
covered prescription drug cost are 
below the GUARD minimum spend 
threshold; and the exclusion of drugs 
subject to an MFP during the price 
applicability period. 
4. GUARD Model Drug Units 
We propose at § 514.125(a) that the 
GUARD Model include every GUARD 
Model drug unit, with some exceptions, 
as defined at 514.5 and described in this 
section of the proposed rule, dispensed 
based on Part D PDE records for GUARD 
Model drugs that are furnished to Part 
D enrollees who reside in ‘‘GUARD 
Model geographic areas’’ as defined by 
§ 514.5, which means the geographic 
areas, defined by Zonal Improvement 
Plan Code Tabulation Areas (hereinafter 
ZCTAs; see Section IV.C. of this 
proposed rule for details), selected for 
participation in the GUARD Model in 
accordance with § 514.110(d), and who 
are part of the GUARD Model 
beneficiary population (as described in 
section IV.C. of this proposed rule). We 
propose to use the PDE data to identify 
GUARD Model drug and drug units 
because it is the prescription drug cost 
and payment data that enables CMS to 
administer the Part D benefit and 
records all prescription drug events for 
drugs covered under the Part D program. 
We propose at § 514.125(b) that the 
following drug units would be excluded 
from the GUARD Model: drug units for 
which payment is subject to an 
agreement under 340B. 
C. Proposed Model Test Design, 
Geographic Selection, and Beneficiary 
Population 
Section 1115A(b) of the Act gives the 
Secretary discretion in the design of 
models, including the geographic reach 
of models. Section 1115A(a)(5) of the 
Act states that the Secretary may elect 
to limit testing of a model to certain 
geographic areas. In this section, we 
describe the proposed model test 
design, including the geographic 
selection approach, and the defined 
beneficiary population that would be 
included in the GUARD Model. 
1. Proposed Model Test Design and 
Identification of Geographic Areas 
At § 514.110(d), we propose a 
randomized design in which the 
GUARD Model geographic approach 
will be determined by selection of 
geographic areas where GUARD Model 
beneficiaries reside, as determined by 
CMS. Model test geographic areas 
would be randomly selected to balance 
the Part D population and Medicare 
expenditures nationwide. Later in this 
Section of the proposed rule, we 
propose the process by which CMS 
would identify the model cohort and 
propose that, prior to the model start, 
CMS would randomly identify the 
model geographic areas. We also 
propose at § 514.130(e) that the 
identification of included beneficiaries 
and the timing of such identification, as 
well as the identification of a 
comparison group, would be performed 
by CMS and would not be subject to 
administrative or judicial review. 
CMS proposes to establish the unit of 
geography for evaluation of GUARD 
Model impacts based on identifying 
existing well-defined geographic units 
that are sufficiently numerous to 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  19:09 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\23DEP3.SGM 23DEP3
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360357 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules support statistical analysis. Based on 
CMS’ review of existing defined 
geographic units that are suitable for 
statistical purposes, CMS, after 
consideration of alternatives, proposes 
at § 514.110(d) that ZCTAs would be an 
appropriate geographic unit to randomly 
select geographic areas included in the 
GUARD Model. At § 514.100, CMS 
defines ‘‘ZCTAs’’ to mean approximate 
area representations of U.S. Postal 
Service 5-digit Zonal Improvement Plan 
(ZIP) Code service routes that the U.S. 
Census Bureau creates using whole 
blocks to present statistical data from 
censuses and surveys, where ‘‘ZIP 
Code’’ means a trademark of the USPS 
created to coordinate mail handling and 
delivery. The USPS assigns ZIP Code 
ranges to regional post offices, which in 
turn assign ZIP Codes to delivery routes. 
ZCTA’s are a geographic product of the 
U.S. Census Bureau, created to allow 
mapping, display, and geographic 
analyses. They are both numerous and 
small in size. ZCTAs are generalized 
and real representations of the 
geographic extent and distribution of 
the U.S. Postal Service 5-digit ZIP Code 
service routes that the U.S. Census 
Bureau creates using whole blocks to 
present statistical data from censuses 
and surveys. The ZIP Code used for 
beneficiary enrollment in Medicare can 
be linked to ZCTAs. 
CMS believes that because of their 
small size and large numbers, the 
random assignment of ZCTAs to define 
the GUARD Model geographic area and 
the associated GUARD Model 
beneficiaries would enable CMS to 
achieve the desired balance in the 
counts of beneficiaries, Part D spending, 
and prescription drug utilization 
between the intervention and 
comparison arms of the GUARD Model 
within the country, within the Part D 
Plan regions, and within Part D plans. 
In addition, ZCTAs are small enough to 
allow CMS to randomly select the 
GUARD geographic area and the 
associated GUARD Model beneficiaries 
to ensure balance in the number of 
beneficiaries included in the GUARD 
Model for each Part D plan. 
The proposed design of the model 
would reduce the potential for 
unintended interactions resulting from 
the geographic selection approach. 
Under this proposed design, the 
beneficiary is assigned to the GUARD 
geographic area based upon the ZCTA 
linked to their enrollment data and not 
where the beneficiary would fill their 
prescription, limiting beneficiary 
incentives to switch pharmacies. For 
example, when a beneficiary is assigned 
to a non-GUARD Model geographic area, 
their prescription fill, even if for a 
GUARD rebatable drug at a pharmacy 
located in a GUARD Model geographic 
area, would not be subject to the 
intervention. Also, because beneficiary 
assignment to a GUARD Model 
geographic area or non-GUARD Model 
geographic area would not change with 
a change in residence, the measurement 
of outcomes to be evaluated in the 
proposed model would not be 
dependent upon the size of the 
geographic area. Therefore, randomizing 
a geographic area that is small and 
numerous, such as a ZCTA, would 
enable balance of measured and 
unmeasured characteristics of the 
geography, the associated resident 
population, and pharmacies and other 
dispensing entities that may be 
associated with this model. 
CMS has considered the variation in 
GUARD Model drugs with respect to 
cost and use in the Medicare population 
and proposed at § 514.110(d) that the 
ideal allocation between GUARD Model 
and non-GUARD Model regions for 
operational fairness is to allocate based 
on a 1:3 ratio. That is, the GUARD 
Model should be tested with 
approximately 25 percent of Medicare 
beneficiaries. A simple random 
selection of 25 percent of ZCTAs would 
result in the selection of approximately 
25 percent of Medicare Part D enrollees 
representing approximately 25 percent 
of Medicare Part D spending. The 
geographic area would be varied, and a 
representative selection of urban and 
rural areas are expected to be included. 
CMS proposes this policy because a 
simple random selection at the ZCTA 
level would enable about a quarter of 
nearly every Part D plan sponsors’ 
beneficiaries to be in the GUARD Model 
and three-quarters would be in the 
comparison group (and therefore, not 
subject to the GUARD Model test). 
2. Proposed Unit of Analysis and 
Defined Population 
In designing the proposed GUARD 
Model, CMS determined that 
conducting the proposed GUARD Model 
test in the population of beneficiaries 
residing in GUARD Model geographic 
areas would provide the best means for 
testing the alternative rebate 
mechanism. 
CMS proposes in § 514.130(a) to 
identify a GUARD Model beneficiary as 
a Part D enrollee who ‘‘resides within 
the GUARD Model geographic area’’, 
which means according to § 514.100, 
that the beneficiary’s home address as 
recorded in CMS’ Medicare Enrollment 
Database [or CMS’ Medicare Beneficiary 
Database (MDB) System] is within the 
set of ZIP Codes linked to ZCTAs 
selected for the GUARD Model 
geographic areas in the U.S., excluding 
U.S. territories as identified in 
§ 514.110. In § 514.5, CMS proposes to 
define a ‘‘GUARD Model beneficiary’’ as 
an individual who is enrolled in a Part 
D plan, either in a standalone 
prescription drug plan (PDP) or 
Medicare Advantage prescription drug 
(MA–PD) plan, but not in an Employer 
Group Waiver Plan (EGWP), and who 
resides in a GUARD Model geographic 
area as determined by the beneficiary’s 
address of record with Medicare. CMS 
proposes at § 514.130(a) that Part D 
enrollees who do not have Medicare as 
their primary payer or are enrolled in 
EGWPs would be excluded from the 
GUARD Model. Therefore, the ‘‘GUARD 
Model beneficiary population’’ is 
defined in this proposed rule at § 514.5, 
to include all Part D enrollees (with the 
exception of those who are enrolled in 
an EGWP) who are furnished with a 
GUARD Model drug as identified in 
Medicare Part D PDE data within the 
GUARD Model performance period and 
who reside within a GUARD Model 
geographic area. 
CMS proposes in § 514.130(b) that 30 
calendar days prior to the start of the 
model, CMS would identify a 
beneficiary as a GUARD Model 
beneficiary. Periodically thereafter, but 
no more than weekly, CMS would 
identify eligible GUARD Model 
beneficiaries who would be 
subsequently aligned to the model. 
GUARD Model beneficiaries would be 
aligned to the model until the model 
ends, or the beneficiary is no longer 
enrolled in Part D. If a GUARD Model 
beneficiary’s address as recorded in 
CMS’ MBD changes (that is, they no 
longer reside within the GUARD Model 
geographic areas) they would continue 
to be aligned to the model, as proposed 
in § 514.110(d). Beneficiaries who 
become newly enrolled in Medicare Part 
D plans and are identified by CMS as 
GUARD Model beneficiaries (because all 
criteria are met) would be aligned to the 
GUARD Model; these beneficiaries (and 
any relevant drug units) would be 
included in the GUARD Model rebate 
payment calculations from the time that 
they newly enroll in Medicare Part D, if 
all criteria are met. Beneficiaries for 
whom Medicare switches from being a 
secondary payer to being the primary 
payer and are identified by CMS as a 
GUARD Model beneficiary (because all 
criteria are met) would be aligned to the 
model cohort at the time that they 
switch, according to § 514.130(c). No 
other beneficiaries would be aligned to 
the GUARD Model after the model 
starts. For example, the following 
changes would not enable beneficiary

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360358 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules alignment to the GUARD Model after 
the model starts: (1) beneficiaries who 
were enrolled in Medicare at the time 
CMS identifies the initial cohort prior to 
the start of the model and had an MBD 
address in a non-GUARD Model 
geographic area then had an address 
change to a GUARD Model geographic 
area; and (2) newly enrolled Medicare 
Part D beneficiaries with an address 
with a new ZIP Code that did not exist 
at the time that the GUARD Model 
geographic areas were identified. 
Defining the population broadly and 
in a manner that fosters a stable and 
consistent model cohort would allow 
CMS to observe the implications of an 
alternative approach to determining the 
GUARD Model rebate payment for 
GUARD Model drugs across a broad set 
of manufacturers and beneficiaries. If 
this proposed rule is finalized, the 
GUARD Model geographic areas would 
be identified in a table that lists the 
model test areas, total number of 
Medicare beneficiaries at the time of 
analysis, and any other relevant 
information no later than 60 calendar 
days in advance of the beginning of the 
GUARD Model performance period. 
This table would be shared on the 
GUARD Model website. Defining the 
population in this manner would allow 
CMS to assess if the GUARD Model 
payment test reduced Medicare costs 
while preserving or enhancing quality of 
care, in line with section 1115A(b)(2) of 
the Act, across a broad set of pharmacies 
and other dispensing entities and Part D 
enrollees, as well as a large set of 
manufacturers. Lessons learned from the 
GUARD Model would inform CMS and 
other interested parties about the effect 
of applying the proposed alternative 
rebate approach to a broader set of drugs 
on Part D enrollees and to the Medicare 
program. 
3. Alternatives Considered 
CMS considered initiating the model 
with a greater number of geographic 
areas to include up to approximately 50 
percent of Part D beneficiaries in the 
model beneficiary cohort instead of our 
proposal to test the model with 
approximately 25 percent of Part D 
beneficiaries. We also considered an 
approach of initially testing the model 
with approximately 25 percent of Part D 
beneficiaries and then after initial 
monitoring observations are assessed, 
increasing the model beneficiary cohort 
to include up to approximately 50 
percent of Part D beneficiaries. We note 
that these alternatives would likely 
necessitate selection of the initial and 
potentially additional geographic areas 
at the same point, prior to model start. 
These approaches would have the 
benefit of enhancing the model 
evaluation as a random selection of 
approximately 50 percent of the 
Medicare Part D population would 
enable a 1:1 allocation of treatment to 
comparison. We also considered 
approaches that CMS could follow to 
identify when and how the included 
geographic areas and beneficiary cohort 
could be increased to include up to 50 
percent of Part D beneficiaries. One 
option is that CMS could increase the 
beneficiary cohort at different points 
throughout the model, depending on 
observed data. For example, based on 
the first 6 months of data, if new patient 
access or supply chain constraints do 
not appear or do not appear to be 
attributed to the GUARD Model, CMS 
could increase the size of the model 
cohort later in the model test period. 
CMS could continue to periodically 
monitor available data and consider 
whether to increase the geographic areas 
included in the model. However, we 
decided against these approaches 
because we believe testing the GUARD 
Model with 25 percent of Medicare Part 
D enrollees across randomly selected 
geographic areas is sufficient for CMS to 
glean learnings on the impacts of the 
model. We seek feedback on this 
approach. 
We also considered the following 
geographic areas as the geographic unit 
from which beneficiaries would be 
included in the model requirements: (1) 
ZIP Codes; (2) counties; (3) states; (4) 
Census-defined Core Based Statistical 
Areas (CBSAs) or Combined Statistical 
Areas (CSAs); and (5) Part D Plan 
regions. ZIP Codes were considered 
because they are the basis for 
determining beneficiary residence. 
However, ZIP Codes, unlike ZCTAs are 
not technically geographic areas, but 
delivery routes for the U.S. Postal 
Service, and they are not Census- 
designated regions. Counties, states and 
CBSAs were determined to be too 
heterogeneous in their size and 
population to achieve the desired 
balance between intervention and 
comparison groups for the proposed 
design. Part D Plan regions were 
considered to reduce operational 
complexity but also were determined to 
be too large and heterogeneous. CMS 
determined that these candidates would 
likely fail to achieve the desired balance 
in the counts of beneficiaries, Part D 
spending, and prescription drug 
utilization between the intervention and 
comparison arms of the GUARD Model 
within the country, within the Part D 
Plan regions, and within Part D plans. 
We welcome comment on this proposal 
and the alternatives considered. 
We considered including the ZCTAs 
of U.S. territories among the geographic 
regions from which the randomly 
selected model geographic area would 
be selected. However, due to operational 
considerations, we decided to exclude 
U.S. territories. We seek feedback on 
this exclusion. 
We also considered randomly 
selecting plans as the unit from which 
Part D drugs would be subject to the 
model requirements. This would enable 
plans to have a uniform consideration of 
how rebates would apply across all their 
beneficiaries. This, however, could 
reduce operational fairness across plans 
nationally so we decided against this 
approach. We welcome comment on our 
proposal to select ZCTAs as our 
geographic unit of analysis. 
In addition, we considered whether to 
include beneficiaries who are enrolled 
in an EGWP. We decided against this, 
however, because there are differences 
in the data that is available for these 
enrollees compared to beneficiaries 
enrolled in standalone PDPs and MA– 
PDs and because we believe this group 
could serve as an important 
counterfactual for subgroup analysis in 
the evaluation. We seek feedback on this 
proposed policy. 
We welcome comment on all of our 
policy proposals presented here, 
including proposals to test the model in 
geographic areas to cover 25 percent of 
Part D beneficiaries in the GUARD 
Model beneficiary population and 
whether CMS should test the model 
with an alternative approach that would 
include additional geographic areas, 
different geographic selection units, 
U.S. territories, and additional 
beneficiaries in the model. 
D. GUARD Model Participants 
1. Proposed Participants 
At § 514.110(a), CMS proposes that 
manufacturers would be the participants 
of the GUARD Model. CMS proposes at 
§ 514.5 that ‘‘manufacturer’’ would have 
the same meaning as that term is 
defined and used in § 428.20 and 
section 1927(k)(5) of the Act. We note 
that this is consistent with how CMS 
defines manufacturer for the purposes of 
the Part D Inflation Rebate Program. We 
propose to define at § 514.5 ‘‘GUARD 
Model participant’’ as a manufacturer of 
a GUARD Model drug that receives a 
Part D inflation rebate report for an 
applicable period that overlaps with the 
GUARD Model performance period. 
At § 514.110(a), CMS proposes that all 
manufacturers that receive a Part D 
inflation rebate report including a 
GUARD Model drug for an applicable 
period that overlaps with the GUARD

required to participate in the GUARD 
Model. There would be no specific 
enrollment activities for GUARD Model 
participants; rather, their participation 
will be effectuated through the 
requirements under the Part D Inflation 
Rebate Program, and where applicable, 
the application of the proposed GUARD 
Model rebate payment, as described in 
section IV.H. of this proposed rule. 
CMS believes that this proposal to 
require participation of manufacturers is 
necessary to conduct the GUARD Model 
test and comprehensively understand 
the potential impacts of the model. 
Mandatory participation can enhance 
the generalizability of model results, as 
mandatory model participants may be 
more broadly representative of all 
organization types that could be affected 
by a model. With a mandatory 
participation policy, CMS would be able 
to observe the experience of 
manufacturers with a diverse range of 
characteristics—including, for example, 
large and small manufacturers—as well 
as manufacturers with varying 
corporation structures; difference in 
penetration within the United States 
and global markets; differences in global 
pricing approaches; and differences in 
marketing strategies. Additionally, CMS 
believes that despite the potential 
opportunity under the GUARD Model to 
lower the Part D program’s financial 
liability and potentially reduce Part D 
enrollees’ financial barriers to access 
GUARD Model drugs, which could, in 
turn, increase U.S. sales of such drugs, 
manufacturers of the proposed GUARD 
Model drugs would likely not volunteer 
to participate in the GUARD Model, 
which would threaten the model test. 
Therefore, CMS believes that mandatory 
participation of manufacturers is 
essential to carrying out the GUARD 
Model test. 
CMS invites comment on our 
proposal for mandatory participation in 
the GUARD Model by manufacturers of 
GUARD Model drugs. We also seek 
feedback on whether manufacturers of 
proposed GUARD Model drugs would 
voluntarily participate in the proposed 
GUARD Model absent a mandatory 
participation requirement while still 
allowing for a robust test and evaluation 
during performance year 1 and 
thereafter. 
2. Mandatory Participation 
Requirements 
CMS proposes that model 
participation would be mandatory for 
all manufacturers that receive a Part D 
inflation rebate report including a 
GUARD Model drug during an 
applicable period that overlaps with the 
GUARD Model performance period. In 
§ 514.110(b) and (c), we propose the 
GUARD Model participant requirements 
during and after the GUARD Model 
performance period and payment years. 
During the GUARD Model 
performance period and payment years, 
CMS proposes that GUARD Model 
participants must— 
€Adhere to the proposed GUARD Model rebate invoicing and payment 
instructions as proposed in § 514.610 
and established by CMS and its

E. Proposed Existing International Drug 
Pricing Data and Reference Countries 
Under the GUARD Model, as 
described in section IV.G. of this 
proposed rule, CMS will test two 
approaches to calculating the GUARD 
Model international benchmark: Method 
I referred to as the GUARD Model 
default international benchmark, and 
Method II, referred to as the GUARD 
Model updated international 
benchmark. This Section of this 
proposed rule discusses the existing 
sources for international drug pricing 
data and the selection process of an 
international drug pricing data source 
that CMS proposes to use, if available, 
to calculate the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark for each 
GUARD Model drug. We also describe 
our proposals to identify the set of 
reference countries that would be used 
to identify the GUARD Model 
international benchmark, both for the 
default and the updated international 
benchmarks. 
1. Existing Data Sources for 
International Drug Pricing Data 
CMS proposes that the selected data 
source for a specific GUARD Model 
drug must contain international drug 
pricing data for that specific GUARD 
Model drug’s set of international 
analogs. We propose, at § 514.5, to 
define ‘‘set of international analogs’’ to 
mean, for each GUARD Model drug, the 
set of international products sold in all 
reference countries, identified in 
§ 514.220(d) and as discussed later in 
this Section of this proposed rule; and, 
we define ‘‘international product’’ to 
mean a drug or biological product, sold 
in a reference country (where ‘‘reference 
country’’ means the countries identified 
in § 514.220(d) and discussed later in 
this Section of this proposed rule), that 
is aligned across its identifying 
characteristics with a GUARD Model 
drug. The identifying characteristics are 
specific to each GUARD Model drug 
(which in accordance with § 514.120(a), 
is identified at the NDC–9 level) and 
include active ingredient(s), route of 
administration, dosage form, and 
strength. Alignment across identifying 
characteristics, according to § 514.410 
and as discussed in section IV.G. of the 
proposed rule, allows for adjustments 
that do not materially modify the nature 
of the drug but account for country- 
specific differences, such as differences 
due to language, units of measurement, 
labeling standards, or differences in 
dosage form or strength. The 
international drug pricing data for 
international analogs would then be 
used to determine, for each GUARD

To assist in consistent and accurate billing of 
pharmaceutical products, NCPDP developed the 
Billing Unit Standard (BUS). The standard contains 
three billing units: EA, ML and GM. CMS also 
requires reporting of unit type for purposes of 
rebates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. When 
possible, the NCPDP billing unit and CMS unit type 
should be aligned. https://standards.ncpdp.org/

international benchmark, as described 
in section IV.G. of this proposed rule, 
which would be used to calculate the 
GUARD Model rebate payment, which 
is described in section IV.H. of this 
proposed rule. 
To calculate the GUARD Model 
default international benchmark as 
described in section IV.G. of this 
proposed rule and proposed at 
§ 514.410, CMS proposes to use existing 
data sources as proposed in § 514.210 
available to CMS that contain 
international drug pricing data, 
including coordinated prices and 
volume data, coordinated sales and 
volume data, or only prices. 
Within the available data sources with 
international drug pricing data that CMS 
proposes to use, sales may be based on 
ex-manufacturer prices (sometimes 
referred to as ex-factory price) that 
represent actual or calculated prices 
paid to the manufacturer by wholesalers 
and other distributors, retail prices, 
prices for other distribution channels, or 
a combination thereof. Confidential 
manufacturer rebates to payers and 
other off-invoice payments would not 
likely be accounted for within this data 
as this data does not typically represent 
net prices. Therefore, existing sources 
for international drug sales data may 
differ from net prices realized by 
manufacturers. However, CMS believes 
the existing data sources are adequate 
for purposes of identifying country-level 
average prices. At § 514.5, ‘‘country- 
level average price’’ is defined for a 
reference country identified in 
§ 514.220(d), as the average or weighted- 
average unitary price for the 
international products sold in the 
specific reference country that are part 
of a GUARD Model drug’s set of 
international analogs, where the unit is 
the lowest dispensable amount of the 
GUARD Model drug expressed in terms 
of National Council for Prescription 
Drug Program (NCPDP) units.
148
If the 
selected data source (according to the 
requirements and selection criteria 
proposed at § 514.210(b) and (c)) 
includes international drug pricing 
information on volume, then the 
country-level average price is a 
weighted-average where the weights are 
the corresponding volume for a price 
expressed in the terms of the NCPDP 
unit corresponding to the GUARD 
Model drug. The country-level average 
prices would serve as the basis for the 
GUARD Model default international 
benchmark, as described in section 
IV.G. of this proposed rule, and CMS 
would select, among these, the lowest 
country-level price, as described in 
section IV.G. of this proposed rule. In 
addition, manufacturers would have the 
option to voluntarily submit 
international drug net pricing data to 
CMS that would potentially be used to 
identify the GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark, as described 
in sections IV.F and IV.G. of this 
proposed rule. 
We identified and assessed several 
existing data sources to confirm the 
availability and sufficiency of 
international drug pricing data for the 
implementation of the GUARD Model. 
Specifically, we reviewed proprietary 
global drug pricing data sources that 
include drug pricing data for a large 
diverse set of pharmaceutical products, 
including the types of pharmaceutical 
products that could be covered under 
Part D, for more than 30 countries. 
These data sources vary with respect to 
the scope (such as products, 
manufacturer level, market level data, 
countries), and periodicity of updates 
(such as daily, monthly, quarterly). 
One existing data source evaluated by 
CMS was IQVIA’s MIDAS

,
149
which is 
an IQVIA proprietary information 
service which integrates IQVIA’s 
national audits into a globally consistent 
view of the pharmaceutical market, and 
provides estimated product volumes of 
registered medicines, trends and market 
share through retail and non-retail 
channels. IQVIA MIDAS
150
includes 
detailed drug product information such 
as brand name, molecule, strength, 
dosage form, pack characteristics, 
manufacturer, regulatory approval, and 
intellectual property protection statuses. 
For each of the drug products, it also 
has sales and volume amounts by 
country, distribution channel (for 
example, retail or hospital), and 
calendar quarter. IQVIA’s MIDAS is 
updated monthly and retains extensive 
historical data for over 90 countries. 
Another potential data source we 
assessed is Global Data Pharmaceutical 
Prices (POLI)
151
data which includes 
prices for at least 80 countries at the 
pack level (pharmaceutical name, 
generic name, dosage form, strength, 
and number of units). POLI includes 
drug product information (such as drug 
descriptor, molecule type, dosage form, 
strength, and classification as brand or 
generic) and market information (such 
as therapeutic area and geography). 
POLI is updated monthly and provides 
historic data since 2016. Eversana 
NAVLIN’s Price & Access database,
152
 
includes pricing data for more than 100 
countries, as well as tools to compare 
international pricing (specifically, 
pricing across countries), and is another 
potential data source. 
CMS believes any of these three data 
sources would provide adequate 
information in a timely way to inform 
CMS’ determination of the GUARD 
Model default international benchmark 
for the vast majority of proposed 
GUARD Model drugs. Therefore, CMS 
has confirmed the availability and 
sufficiency of at least three international 
drug pricing data sources for the 
implementation of the GUARD Model 
and we acknowledge that it is possible 
for other international drug pricing data 
sources to be utilized for the 
determination of the GUARD Model 
default international benchmark. 
CMS proposes at § 514.210(a) to 
identify data sources of international 
drug pricing data for each GUARD 
Model drug’s set of international 
analogs that are sold in the reference 
countries identified in § 514.220(d) for 
purposes of calculating the GUARD 
Model default international benchmark, 
prior to the GUARD Model rebate 
payment calculation for the first 
performance year. During subsequent 
performance years, for any GUARD 
Model drug that was not a GUARD 
Model drug in any of the previous 
performance years, CMS proposes to 
identify data sources of international 
drug pricing data for each of these 
GUARD Model drug’s set of 
international analogs that are sold in the 
reference countries identified in 
§ 514.220(d) for purposes of calculating 
the GUARD Model default international 
benchmark, prior to the GUARD Model 
rebate payment calculation for the 
corresponding subsequent performance 
year.

Individual countries differ in the regulatory 
processes and standards governing approval of 
drugs and biological products.Use of international 
drug pricing information in the proposed GUARD 
Model should not be interpreted to connote FDA 
approval or to otherwise describe any scientific or 
regulatory relationship between U.S.-approved or 
licensed and non-U.S.-approved or licensed 
products. 
CMS proposes in § 514.210(c), for 
each GUARD Model drug, to select a 
data source that CMS has access to, has 
international drug pricing information 
and fulfills the following five criteria 
(proposed at § 514.210(b)). 
First, the data source(s) must 
incorporate and apply standardized 
approaches within and between 
countries to consistently define drug 
products in terms of their active 
ingredient(s), route of administration, 
dosage forms, and strengths. This 
criterion means a data source must have 
the following elements. 
€A standardized active ingredient naming scheme, such as using an 
internationally recognized set of 
scientific (nonproprietary) names (for 
example, International Nonproprietary 
Names
153
(INN) names). 
€A standardized method to differentiate between dosage forms 
(including route of administration) of 
drug products such as using an 
internationally recognized 
nomenclature for pharmaceutical dosage 
forms like the New Form Code 
classification. 
€A standardized method for differentiating between different dosage 
strengths of drug products in terms of 
different strength units that can reliably 
be converted to and expressed in terms 
of NCPDP units—the units used in Part 
D. 
This first criterion is necessary 
because the process that CMS proposes 
to calculate the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark, as discussed 
in section IV.G. of this proposed rule, 
requires international drug pricing data 
to be aligned with each GUARD Model 
drug across active ingredient, route of 
administration, dosage form, and 
strength. 
Second, the data source(s) must use 
and apply a standardized approach 
based on country-specific regulatory 
approval pathways that, at a minimum, 
distinguishes international generics and 
international biosimilar biological 
products
154
At § 514.5 CMS proposes 
‘‘international generic’’ to mean, for a 
reference country identified in 
§ 514.220(d), a drug approved and 
marketed in a reference country under 
that reference country’s regulatory 
framework under a pathway similar to 
section 505(j) of the FD&C Act in the 
United States; and ‘‘international 
biosimilar biological product’’ to mean, 
for a reference country identified in 
§ 514.220(d), a biological product 
approved and licensed in a reference 
country under that reference country’s 
regulatory framework under a pathway 
similar to section 351(k) of the PHS Act 
in the United States. If the data source 
does not directly differentiate approval 
pathways but has other factors that can 
allow for this differentiation to be 
implemented, CMS will evaluate the 
specific case and may consider the 
criterion fulfilled. For instance, it is 
possible that the data source includes a 
standardized approach based on 
country-specific regulations to identify 
products with or without brand names, 
with or without intellectual property 
protection (for example, patents), or as 
single-source or multi-source products 
depending on the extent of competition 
in each market. 
Third, the data source(s) must contain 
either: (1) coordinated international 
drug price data and volume data; (2) 
coordinated international drug sales and 
volume data that can be used to 
calculate prices; or (3) drug price data. 
Such data must be expressed in a 
standardized manner (for example, with 
appropriate and clearly defined volume 
and monetary units). For volume data, 
this means the quantity of units where 
the lowest dispensable amount is or can 
be converted into NCPDP units. For 
price or sales data, this means a price or 
sales amount corresponding to a volume 
that is recorded in a standardized 
currency across countries within that 
data source. Such data must also be 
accompanied by written or other 
structured descriptions of the methods 
underlying the generation of the data, 
including conversion and projection 
factors. 
Fourth, the data source must have a 
process for data cleaning and validation, 
including but not limited to checking 
errors, identifying outliers, and where 
possible, comparing with other relevant 
information as part of the validation 
process. 
Fifth, the data source(s) must be 
maintained by organizations that seek to 
limit the lag inherent in data to no more 
than 90 calendar days from the end of 
the period for which drug pricing data 
is compiled to the time that the 
organization makes such updates 
available to users of the data source. We 
believe the limit of no more than 90 
calendar days provides sufficient time 
for organizations to collect data, perform 
data quality checks, and update their 
data sources, and for CMS to obtain and 
use the data available. 
In addition, we propose at 
§ 514.210(c) to use international drug 
pricing information for international 
products that are part of the set of 
international analogs for each GUARD 
Model drug in reference countries from 
no earlier than January 1, 2024 to 
increase the likelihood that GUARD 
Model drugs are included in 
international drug pricing data sources, 
as well as to mitigate incentives to limit 
the availability of international drug 
pricing data during the GUARD Model 
performance period. 
We seek feedback on our approach to 
existing sources for international drug 
pricing data. 
2. Proposed Hierarchy for Using 
Existing Data Sources 
For each GUARD Model drug, CMS 
would apply the approach proposed in 
§ 514.210(c) to determine the 
international drug pricing data source 
that would be used to obtain 
international drug pricing data for a 
specific GUARD Model drug’s set of 
international analogs. The data source 
that is selected would then be used to 
calculate the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark, as discussed 
in section IV.G. of this proposed rule. 
Among the existing international drug 
pricing data sources that CMS is able to 
access, for the GUARD Model’s first 
performance year, we propose a 
hierarchy in § 514.210(c) for identifying 
and selecting which international drug 
pricing data source to use in obtaining 
international drug pricing data for each 
GUARD Model drug’s set of 
international analogs. CMS would select 
the data source at the highest level of 
the following hierarchy: 
€First level: The data source with coordinated sales and volume data for 
the set of international analogs in the 
highest number of reference countries, 
identified in § 514.220(d), for any 
duration of the 12-month period 
corresponding to the 12-month calendar 
year prior to the start of the first 
performance year. If data for the 12- 
month period corresponding to the 12- 
month calendar year prior to the start of 
the first performance year is not 
available, data for any duration of the 
most recently available prior 12-month 
period beginning on or after January 1, 
2024, would be used. 
€Second level: The data source with coordinated prices and volume data for 
the set of international analogs in the 
highest number of reference countries, 
identified in § 514.220(d), for any 
duration of the 12-month period 
corresponding to the 12-month calendar

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360362 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules year prior to the start of the first 
performance year. If data for the 12- 
month period corresponding to the 12- 
month calendar year prior to the start of 
the first performance year is not 
available, data for any duration of the 
most recently available prior 12-month 
period beginning on or after January 1, 
2024, would be used. 
€Third level: The data source with price data for the set of international 
analogs in the highest number of 
reference countries, identified in 
§ 514.220(d), for any duration of the 12- 
month period corresponding to the 12- 
month calendar year prior to the start of 
the first performance year. If data for the 
12-month period corresponding to the 
12-month calendar year prior to the start 
of the first performance year is not 
available, data for any duration of the 
most recently available prior 12-month 
period beginning on or after January 1, 
2024, would be used. 
CMS believes using a 12-month 
period is appropriate because this 
mirrors the duration of the performance 
year and gives sufficient time for an 
international product to accrue 
transactions that are captured by the 
selected data source. Regardless of the 
period of time used by the selected data 
source to measure pricing information, 
CMS proposes at 514.410(c)(3) to 
aggregate data to the 12-month period, 
regardless of the duration of time for 
which observations are available within 
the 12-month period. For instance, if the 
data source has pricing information 
reported on a monthly basis and there 
is data for 7 of the 12 months, the 7 
monthly data points would be used. 
In cases when there is more than one 
data source meeting the requirements 
proposed in § 514.210(b) and they are 
all equal on the level of the hierarchy 
noted previously, CMS proposes to 
select a single data source based on an 
assessment of the relative reliability and 
generalizability of the data from each 
available data source. This assessment 
and CMS’ resulting decision will be 
based on the technical characteristics of 
the data source rather than on the 
relative magnitude of prices from one 
source or another. CMS’ assessment may 
consider, among others, the following 
factors: the share of national reference 
country markets reflected in the data 
source, the specificity of price 
information to specific international 
analog products, the number of data 
points available, methods to identify 
and address any errors, and data 
validation processes. 
For the GUARD Model’s subsequent 
performance years, we propose in 
§ 514.210(c) that the same hierarchy 
approach as the one noted previously 
would apply, except that instead of first 
performance year it would apply to the 
subsequent performance year. 
Under this proposal, for each GUARD 
Model drug, CMS would use an existing 
data source with international drug 
pricing data that CMS can access to 
calculate the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark, as described 
in section IV.G. of this proposed rule, 
once during the GUARD Model 
performance period. This means that the 
GUARD Model default international 
benchmark would not be revised over 
time with more recent international 
pricing data. Table B1 illustrates this 
proposal. We propose this policy to 
limit the possibility that a data source 
that meets CMS’ criteria would 
experience challenges in collecting data 
about GUARD Model drugs in the 
future. We considered the possibility of 
using the most recent international 
pricing data to update the GUARD 
Model default international benchmark 
annually to correspond to each 
performance year. However, we believe 
that doing so increases the risk that a 
drug (for which a GUARD Model default 
international benchmark had been 
previously identified) would not have 
the available data to construct a 
benchmark in future years. We welcome 
comments on this policy proposal. 
An example of how the proposed 
selection process would apply is 
presented in Table B2 It illustrates how 
the hierarchy would function. Table B2 
also illustrates that for data sources 
within the same proposed level of 
hierarchy (having the same pricing data 
available), selection would be made in 
the following way: first, by choosing the 
data source with the highest number of 
reference countries and second, by 
choosing the data source with the most 
recent 12-month period with respect to 
the start of the first performance year 
(January 1, 2027). We seek feedback on 
our proposed selection process.

3. Proposed Criteria and Process for 
Identifying the Set of Reference 
Countries 
In this Section of this proposed rule, 
we propose the criteria and process that 
CMS would use to identify the non-U.S. 
countries that would be included in the 
set of reference countries for the 
GUARD Model for purposes of 
calculating the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark, as described 
in section IV.G. of this proposed rule. 
Our proposed approach aims to select 
a large set of countries that are 
economically similar, have reasonably 
comparable purchasing power to the 
United States, and generally have 
existing international drug pricing 
information available. In § 514.220(b), 
CMS proposes to identify a set of 
reference countries that are non-U.S. 
Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development (OECD) members as of 
October 1, 2025 with: (1) purchasing 
power parity (PPP)-adjusted per capita 
gross domestic product (GDP) that is at 
least 60 percent of the corresponding 
U.S. level, as estimated and available in 
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
World Factbook; and (2) annual (PPP)- 
adjusted aggregate GDP that is at least 
$400 billion (as measured in U.S. 
dollars) as estimated and available in 
the CIA World Factbook. 
For each country, CMS proposes at 
§ 514.220(b) to use (PPP)-adjusted per 
capita GDP and (PPP)-adjusted aggregate 
GDP, as estimated and available in the 
CIA World Factbook, to identify the 
reference countries. We note that while 
the CIA online World Factbook is 
updated daily, the underlying data such 
as GDP and PPP are reported no more 
frequently than annually, based on a 
July 1 mid-point. Therefore, our 
proposal is to identify the set of 
reference countries using data available 
as of October 1, 2025, in the CIA World 
Factbook. There are other existing 
sources for GDP per capita data besides 
the CIA World Factbook, including the 
World Bank, and the International 
Monetary Fund. Upon examining these 
sources, we found that the GDP data 
across these sources are highly 
associated with one another. and 
include data for countries that are 
economically comparable to the United 
States. We propose using the CIA World 
Factbook as our source for GDP data as 
it is issued by a U.S. government 
agency.
155
 
We believe that applying a minimum 
of 60 percent of the United States’s 
(PPP)-adjusted per capita GDP and a 
minimum $400 billion (PPP)-adjusted 
aggregate GDP strikes a balance between 
having too low (PPP)-adjusted per capita 
GDP and (PPP)-adjusted aggregate GDP 
thresholds and including data from 
countries with economies that are 
substantially different from the United 
States, while also not having such high 
(PPP)-adjusted per capita GDP and 
(PPP)-adjusted aggregate GDP thresholds 
that the set of reference countries would 
be very small. Therefore, we believe that 
our proposed approach is appropriate 
and would result in a set of reference 
countries that are economically similar, 
have reasonably comparable purchasing 
power to the United States, and 
generally have existing international 
drug pricing data that is available. 
We propose that CMS would identify 
the set of reference countries using CIA 
World Factbook data that is available to 
CMS as of October 1, 2025. We propose 
that the identified set of reference 
countries would remain the same 
throughout the GUARD Model 
performance period, even if a country 
would not meet the criteria for the set 
of reference countries during any 
performance year of the model. 
Considering the relatively short 
duration of the performance period (5- 
years), CMS believes that this approach 
yields increased stability for the GUARD 
Model test, affords manufacturers 
stability, and reduces substantial 
administrative burden for 
manufacturers. 
4. Set of Reference Countries for the 
GUARD Model Identified Using the 
Proposed Methodology 
Using the criteria to identify the set of 
reference countries for the GUARD 
Model that CMS proposes in 
§ 514.220(b), CMS identified the set of 
reference countries by applying our 
proposed criteria to non-U.S. OECD- 
member countries using CIA World 
Factbook data that was available on 
October 1, 2025; this results in the 
following set of reference countries: 
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, 
Czech Republic, Denmark, France, 
Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, 
the Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the 
United Kingdom. All 19 countries are 
economically comparable to the United 
States with (PPP)-adjusted per capita 
GDP in 2024 (the most recent data 
available) falling between 61 and 153 
percent of U.S (PPP)-adjusted per capita 
GDP in 2024 and have an aggregate 
(PPP)-adjusted GDP in 2024 exceeding 
$400 billion. We propose that the set of 
reference countries listed previously 
would be the GUARD Model’s reference 
countries and remain the same 
throughout the 5 years of the model’s 
performance period. Table B3 presents 
the (PPP)-adjusted per capita GDP, 
(PPP)-adjusted aggregate GDP, and GDP 
(PPP) adjuster for the United States and 
the proposed reference countries.

We seek comment on whether there 
are any inclusion or exclusion policies 
we should consider after identifying the 
set of reference countries using the 
proposed criteria. CMS also welcomes 
comments on any of the proposed 
policies in this Section of this proposed 
rule. 
5. Alternatives Considered 
For the policy proposals presented in 
this Section of this proposed rule, CMS 
considered a number of alternatives, 
including alternatives related to the 
proposed existing data sources and the 
proposed hierarchy as well as the 
proposed criteria and process for 
identifying the set of reference 
countries. 
a. Alternatives Related to Data Sources 
and the Proposed Hierarchy 
In cases when there is more than one 
data source meeting the requirements 
for a GUARD Model drug and using the 
hierarchy proposed in § 514.210(c), 
CMS considered using the data source at 
the highest level of the hierarchy with 
the lowest country-level average price. 
However, CMS believes that selecting 
based on the relative reliability and 
quality of the data from each available 
data source better serves the model test. 
Other hierarchy arrangements were 
also considered. One proposal CMS 
considered was to not differentiate 
between data sources based on the 
number of reference countries for which 
they have data. This would mean that a 
data source with one reference country 
would be considered at the same 
hierarchy level as a data source with 
multiple reference countries if they had 
the same timeframe and pricing data 
available. Under this option, ties 
between data sources would be resolved 
by selecting the data source with the 
lowest country-level average price, in 
absolute terms, regardless of the number 
of reference countries contained in the 
data source. We also considered a 
hierarchy arrangement that prioritized 
recency of timeframe for the data over 
the type of pricing information 
available. For this potential proposal, a 
data source that contained only prices, 
but with data for a more recent 
timeframe, would be selected over a 
data source with sales and volume data 
with a less recent timeframe. However, 
CMS believes that by prioritizing the 
data source according to: (1) type of

The GDP (PPP) adjuster is necessary to account for differences in the economic capacity between the countries. In this case the GDP (PPP) adjuster accounts for differences between the reference countries' (PPP)-adjusted per capita GDP and the U.S. (PPP)-adjusted per capita GDP. The GDP (PPP) adjuster is obtained by dividing the 2024 (PPP)-adjusted per capita GDP of the 
United States by the reference country's 2024 (PPP)-adjusted per capita GDP. In cases marked with a *, where the reference country has a greater (PPP)-adjusted per capita GDP than the United States, the adjusted is kept at one (not allowed to go below one).

pricing data; (2) number of reference 
countries with data;
157
and (3) recency 
of data, the selected data source is the 
best possible in terms of completeness, 
quality, and recency. Therefore, CMS 
believes that the proposed approach is 
appropriate for determining the GUARD 
Model default international benchmark. 
CMS also considered an even broader 
approach. Under this potential proposal, 
CMS would allow each GUARD Model 
drug to have more than one data source 
contribute to its corresponding 
international drug pricing information. 
CMS would make no adjustments for 
differences between the data sources. 
This means that for one GUARD Model 
drug, international drug pricing 
information could be from data source 
A for three reference countries, data 
source B for two different reference 
countries, data source C for four other 
different reference countries, and so on; 
the reference country-level average 
prices obtained for each of those 
reference countries would be compared 
to select the lowest without any data 
source specific adjustment. This broad 
approach would allow for more 
reference countries to be included in the 
calculation of the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark. However, the 
potential drawback of this approach is 
that there would be differences with 
respect to the type of international 
pricing information between the data 
sources for the same GUARD Model 
drug. For instance, one data source 
could have a price that incorporates 
retail and non-retail prices; another data 
source has only in-patient prices; and 
another has only government prices. 
There would be no clear standard way 
of adjusting the prices to make them 
directly comparable, thus CMS would 
have proposed making no adjustments. 
While this approach would have 
maximized the number of reference 
countries available to select the lowest 
country-level average price, CMS 
believes that the drawbacks outweigh 
the benefits and so we did not propose 
this policy. 
CMS also considered adding a 
hierarchy level at the end that would 
allow CMS to consider pricing data in 
the form of prices made public in any 
other source even if they do not comply 
with the data source requirements 
outlined in § 514.210(b) when there is 
no compliant and available data source. 
However, CMS believes it unlikely that 
this approach would yield sufficient 
detail for alignment of international 
analogs to the GUARD Model drug. 
Therefore, we did not propose this 
policy. 
We also considered using all the 
available data sources for a GUARD 
Model drug and calculating the average 
of the pricing information available 
across all the data sources. Because this 
alternative approach could result in 
cases where different types of pricing 
information for a drug from a reference 
country would be combined, we are not 
proposing this at this time and may 
reconsider the potential value of this 
approach based on feedback from 
interested parties and further 
information gathering. 
We are interested in better 
understanding the existing data sources 
for international drug pricing data that 
may be available and steps we could 
follow to best use such data sources for 
the GUARD Model. CMS solicits 
feedback on the proposed policies as 
well as alternative proposals for the 
hierarchy of data sources that would be 
used in calculating the GUARD Model 
default international benchmark. CMS 
welcomes comments on the methods or 
processes that we should consider when 
more than one existing data source is 
available at the highest level of the 
hierarchy for the purpose of 
determining which data source to use 
when there are multiple potential 
sources available. We also seek 
comments on how CMS might refine the 
hierarchy for potential use of more than 
one data source for a GUARD Model 
drug or for ways in which we might be 
able to incorporate new data sources 
that may become available during the 
GUARD Model performance period. We 
also welcome comments on how CMS 
should weigh data sources that include 
fewer reference countries, but which 
incorporate discounts, rebates, or other 
price concessions. 
b. Alternatives Related to Identifying the 
Set of Reference Countries 
We considered different criteria to 
identify a country’s economy size based 
on minimum percentages of U.S. (PPP)- 
adjusted per capita GDP. For example, 
a (PPP)-adjusted per capita GDP 
threshold of 80 percent of the 
corresponding U.S. level would result in 
the set of reference countries only 
including eight countries (Austria, 
Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and 
Switzerland), all of which are in 
Western Europe. We also considered 
different criteria to identify economy 
size based on different (PPP)-adjusted 
aggregate GDP. For example, $300 
billion, $1 and $2 trillion. Again, this 
resulted in either including countries 
significantly different from the United 
States or too few countries. For instance, 
an aggregate (PPP)-adjusted GDP level of 
$2 trillion results in only three non-U.S. 
OECD member countries—Canada, 
Germany, and Japan—being included. 
We welcome feedback on our proposals 
to include only OECD reference 
countries that have a (PPP)-adjusted per 
capita GDP of 60 percent and an annual 
(PPP)-adjusted aggregate GDP of at least 
$400 billion. 
We also considered alternative 
approaches to our proposed criteria for 
identifying the set of reference 
countries. Specifically, we considered 
including all non-U.S. OECD member 
countries or including countries based 
on factors such as having a national 
regulatory authority recognized as a 
Stringent Regulatory Authority by the 
World Health Organization (WHO) (to 
be replaced by the WHO-listed authority 
or WLA)
158 159
and intellectual property 
protections. We also considered 
including only countries that may 
represent large markets for drug 
manufacturers such as all countries in 
the European Union, Canada, Japan, and 
United Kingdom. However, we do not 
believe that these approaches would be 
as optimal for purposes of identifying 
the GUARD Model default international 
benchmark because they would result in 
either too few countries or countries 
with economies too different from the 
United States being included as 
reference countries for the GUARD 
Model. 
We also considered alternatives that 
would phase-in countries or would 
adjust the set of reference countries over 
time based on a defined set of 
characteristics, such GDP per capita or 
average drug prices. However, we 
believe that phasing in countries over 
time or adjusting the set of reference 
countries periodically would create 
instability within the GUARD Model 
test and could confound 
implementation, monitoring, and 
evaluation activities as well as cause 
potential negative impacts on GUARD 
Model participants (for example, 
creating confusion regarding voluntary 
data submission). In addition, if we 
adopted a phase-in of countries or an 
adjustment to the set of countries during 
the GUARD Model performance period, 
it would mean that we would also need

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360367 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules to consider whether to change our 
proposal to maintain the GUARD Model 
default international benchmark for the 
duration of the model test if we 
determine that the phase-in would 
apply to all GUARD Model drugs, 
regardless of when they became a 
GUARD Model drug, which creates 
additional complexity. For all these 
reasons, we propose to maintain a stable 
set of reference countries for the 
duration of the GUARD Model. 
Although we have concerns about the 
potential negative impacts that could 
occur if the set of reference countries is 
not held constant during the 5-year 
GUARD Model performance period, as 
discussed in this Section of this 
proposed rule, we welcome comment on 
the potential benefits and drawbacks of 
establishing a threshold for adding or 
removing a country from the set of 
reference countries at certain points 
during the model performance period. 
Specifically, we seek comment on 
whether a country should be removed 
from the set of reference countries if the 
CIA World Factbook data for a calendar 
year after 2024 shows that, for 2 
consecutive calendar years, the country 
does not meet the criteria for inclusion 
in the set of reference countries that are 
finalized in a final rule that establishes 
the GUARD Model. We also welcome 
comment on the processes and timing 
that would be necessary to 
operationalize a change to the set of 
reference countries that would 
minimize impacts on the model test. For 
example, to allow time for model 
operations and manufacturer activities 
to adjust, it may be necessary or prudent 
to establish a specified period when 
CMS would review available CIA World 
Factbook data for a calendar year and a 
minimum amount of time between 
CMS’ identification that a country no 
longer meets the criteria for inclusion in 
the set of reference countries and when 
the set of reference countries would be 
revised. We also welcome comment on 
the potential benefits and drawbacks of 
setting a threshold for removal at 2 
consecutive years and whether a 
different length of time would be 
sufficient to justify a change to the set 
of reference countries. 
F. Proposed Submission of International 
Drug Net Pricing Data 
In this Section of this proposed rule, 
we describe the process for submission 
of international drug net pricing data 
that manufacturers may choose to 
exercise for GUARD Model drugs. CMS 
is proposing at § 514.310(a) that, subject 
to certain conditions, manufacturers of 
GUARD Model drugs would have the 
option to voluntarily submit to CMS, the 
international drug net pricing data that 
corresponds with a manufacturer’s 
GUARD Model drug, which could then 
be used to determine the GUARD Model 
updated international benchmark for 
that specific GUARD Model drug, as 
described in section IV.G. of this 
proposed rule. The international drug 
net pricing data would need to 
correspond to net pricing information 
for a GUARD Model drug’s set of 
international analogs, as defined in 
section IV.E. of this proposed rule. 
At § 514.310(b), CMS proposes to 
assess each data ‘‘submission,’’ which 
we define at § 514.5 to mean 
manufacturer international drug net 
pricing data voluntarily submitted to 
CMS to consider for use for the 
performance year for which it was 
submitted. In other words, each 
submission is only used by CMS for the 
specific corresponding performance 
year, and any subsequent performance 
year would need a separate submission. 
CMS proposes at § 514.310(b) that a 
submission is determined to be an 
applicable submission if it fulfils the 
data requirements which include 
verification of the submission for 
completeness and validity by CMS. As 
such, CMS defines at § 514.5 that 
‘‘applicable submission’’ means a 
voluntary manufacturer submission that 
CMS determines fulfils the data 
requirements, which include 
verification of the submission for 
completeness and validity, and 
therefore is suitable for determination of 
the GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark per 
§ 514.410(d). Only submissions 
determined to be applicable by CMS are 
suitable for determination of the 
GUARD Model updated international 
benchmark, as explained in section 
IV.G. of this proposed rule. 
1. Proposed Voluntary Submission of 
International Drug Net Pricing Data 
Under the GUARD Model, if a 
manufacturer elects to submit 
international drug net pricing data for a 
GUARD Model drug, CMS proposes that 
the manufacturer would be required to 
execute a data agreement at least 90 
calendar days prior to submission. The 
‘‘data agreement’’ would establish 
terms, conditions, and requirements, 
including data completeness and 
validity requirements; compliance 
responsibilities; CMS confidentiality 
obligations; and other ongoing 
requirements. In § 514.310(b), CMS 
proposes a one-year data agreement 
duration aligned with annual 
submission cycles. Manufacturers may 
make a submission for one or more 
GUARD Model drugs. For each GUARD 
Model drug, the submission would 
include the set of international analogs 
with sales in the reference countries 
identified in § 514.220(d) that occur 
during the performance year for which 
the submission applies. 
CMS proposes that manufacturers 
who elect the option to submit 
international drug net pricing data for a 
GUARD Model drug must include data 
that corresponds to the same timeframe 
as the performance year for which it 
will be used to determine the GUARD 
Model updated international 
benchmark. Submission of the data 
must occur within 180 calendar days of 
the end of the performance year. For 
example, for the first performance year 
ending on December 31, 2027, CMS 
must receive manufacturer net pricing 
data by June 29, 2028, for it to be 
considered for the GUARD Model 
updated international benchmark 
determination, if deemed applicable, 
and this submission must include data 
for the entire first performance year 
(January 1, 2027 to December 31, 2027). 
This would mean manufacturers would 
have to establish a data agreement by 
March 31, 2028, at the latest. 
CMS recognizes that 180 calendar 
days after the end of the performance 
year would mean that the published list 
of Part D rebatable drugs would only 
account for nine months of said 
performance year. This is due to the 
different timelines between the Part D 
Inflation Rebate Program (an applicable 
period begins in October and lasts 12 
months) and the GUARD Model (a 
performance year beings in January and 
lasts 12 months). However, CMS 
believes that manufacturers are able to 
identify whether a drug is a Part D 
inflation rebatable drug and a GUARD 
Model drug by applying the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. Therefore, CMS 
believes the 180 calendar days are 
sufficient for manufacturers to know 
with reasonable certainty if their drug is 
a Part D rebatable drug and whether it 
meets criteria for a GUARD Model drug. 
CMS considered shortening this 
period, specifically considering whether 
a submission should occur within 90 
calendar days of the end of the 
performance year. However, CMS 
believes that given the data lags, 
providing sufficient time for 
manufacturers to process data is 
necessary. Therefore, a longer period is 
preferable. CMS also considered an even 
longer period than the current proposal, 
specifically considering whether a 
submission should occur within 10 
calendar quarters after the end of the 
performance year to allow for time for 
the list of Part D rebatable drugs to be 
published. However, this would extend

As defined at proposed § 514.300 
‘‘international regulatory approval status’’ means 
any information relevant and sufficient for CMS to 
determine whether each international product’s 
approval or licensing status according to the 
reference country’s regulatory framework would 
make it an international generic, international 
biosimilar biological product, or neither. Individual 
countries differ in the regulatory processes and 
standards governing approval of drugs and 
biological products.Use of international drug 
pricing information in the proposed GUARD Model 
should not be interpreted to connote FDA approval 
or to otherwise describe any scientific or regulatory 
relationship between U.S.-approved or licensed and 
non-U.S.-approved or licensed products. 
the time for rebate payment 
calculations, invoicing, reconciliation, 
and due dates of payments and 
reconciliation amounts, if a 
manufacturer chooses to submit 
international drug net pricing data. One 
potential way of doing this would be 
using the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark for the GUARD 
Model drug up until the time when the 
manufacturer submits international drug 
net pricing data, if they choose to do so. 
Assuming the submission is deemed an 
applicable submission by CMS, the 
payment amount would be updated and 
reconciled based on the GUARD Model 
updated international benchmark. 
However, this approach would be more 
complex and potentially create 
unpredictability for both CMS and 
manufacturers. CMS believes that 
manufacturers are able to identify 
GUARD Model drugs by applying the 
criteria under the Part D Inflation Rebate 
Program and the GUARD Model as 
proposed at § 514.120; therefore, we do 
not believe these alternative approaches 
are preferable. CMS welcomes 
comments on this proposal and the 
alternatives considered. 
Upon submission of the data, CMS 
proposes to conduct a verification 
review to determine whether the 
submission meets the submission 
requirements as proposed in 
§ 514.310(b), which is necessary for 
CMS to determine whether the 
submission represents an applicable 
submission for use in determining the 
GUARD Model updated international 
benchmark. We describe the verification 
review process in more detail later in 
this Section of this proposed rule. 
For CMS to determine that the 
submission is an applicable submission, 
CMS proposes in § 514.310(c) and (d) 
that the data must include all the basic 
data elements required by CMS for the 
set of international analogs that 
corresponds to a GUARD Model drug, as 
described later in this Section of the 
proposed rule, as well as all the net 
pricing data elements required under 
one of the two options manufacturers 
can select to submit net pricing data, in 
addition to all other requirements. CMS 
proposes at § 514.310(g) that if, for any 
of the basic or net pricing data elements, 
third-party individuals and 
organizations were relied upon to 
gather, analyze, or submit the data, the 
manufacturer must note its reliance on 
a third party with respect to each of the 
type of activities (gather, analyze, or 
submit the data) engaged in by the third 
party, and the third-party individual or 
organization identified. 
In addition, CMS proposes in 
§ 514.310(b) that the submission is 
verified for completeness, which 
includes the executed data agreement; 
attestation (as described later in this 
Section of this proposed rule); 
submission using the proper portal in 
the manner and form requested by CMS; 
and all basic data elements and net 
pricing data elements. CMS also 
proposes that the submission is verified 
for validity as part of the verification 
review process, and to do so, CMS may 
utilize all available existing data sources 
and information to assess the extent to 
which the submission reflects 
international drug net pricing in the 
reference countries. Additionally, CMS 
may choose to request additional 
supporting information and/or data 
before completing the assessment of 
validity of the submission and finalizing 
review. We describe this process in 
more detail later in this Section of this 
proposed rule. 
2. Basic Data Requirements 
The basic data requirements, as 
proposed at § 514.310(c), consist of data 
elements that manufacturers would be 
required to submit in order for CMS to 
corroborate that the set of international 
analogs which are included in the 
submission are aligned with the GUARD 
Model drug. Identification of 
international analogs based on 
alignment of the international analog’s 
identifying characteristics with the 
GUARD Model drug’s characteristics 
should be consistent with the alignment 
approach to identify the set of 
international analogs proposed at 
§ 514.410(c). CMS would issue 
supplementary guidance with more 
information. 
CMS proposes that these data 
elements would be required for the set 
of international analogs that correspond 
to a GUARD Model drug. This means 
that if, for a GUARD Model drug, there 
are multiple reference countries that sell 
some or all the international products 
that are part of the set of international 
analogs, the manufacturer submission 
should include the basic data elements 
for all the international products sold in 
each reference country. That is, the 
basic data requirements necessitate 
submitting the data elements separately 
for each reference country; and within 
each reference country, the data 
submission must include all the 
international products that are part of 
the set of international analogs that are 
sold in the reference country. This is 
necessary to allow CMS to verify, by 
reference country the international 
products sold that are part of the set of 
international analogs for the GUARD 
Model drug. 
The required basic data elements are 
the GUARD Model drug brand name, 
nonproprietary name, and NDC–9; and 
then for every reference country where 
some or all of the international products 
that are part of the set of international 
analogs for the GUARD Model drug are 
sold during the submission performance 
year, a list of every international 
product sold in that reference country. 
In other words, there must be a list for 
every reference country where at least 
one international product of the set of 
international analogs are sold. This list 
of international products (that are part 
of the set of international analogs for the 
GUARD Model drug) must have the 
following details for each international 
product: 
€Scientific name and active ingredient(s). 
€Brand name(s) (all variations if there are multiple in the reference 
country) and nonproprietary name. 
€Names of manufacturers, marketers, distributors, licensees, or other entities 
responsible for selling the international 
product in the reference country. 
€International regulatory approval status.
160
 
€Route of administration and dosage form as they are expressed in the 
reference country and in equivalent 
terms to what is expressed in the NDC 
directory for the GUARD Model drug. 
€Dosage strength and dosing unit as they are expressed in the reference 
country and in NCPDP equivalent units 
according to the GUARD Model drug’s 
NCPDP unit. 
€All package forms and sizes available. 
Refer to Table B4 for an illustrative 
example of the basic data elements.

information regarding the definitions of 
the data elements, the manner and form 
in which they must be submitted, 
guidelines to facilitate identification of 
the international products that are part 
of the set of international analogs for the 
corresponding GUARD Model drug, 
guidelines on currency conversion, 
reasonable assumptions that may be 
necessary for any of the data elements, 
instructions for the submission process, 
and any other relevant topic related to 
the voluntary submission of 
international drug net pricing data. 
CMS will review the basic data 
elements reported in each submission to 
determine if the appropriate set of 
international analogs for the GUARD 
Model drug have been submitted. CMS 
may use existing data sources of 
international drug pricing data, such as 
IQVIA MIDAS or POLI data, as well as 
publicly available information on the 
drugs sold in reference countries, to 
determine if the full set of international 
analogs that are sold in the reference 
countries have been submitted for a 
GUARD Model drug. The full set of 
international analogs includes all 
international products sold in each of 
the reference countries whose 
identifying characteristics (active 
ingredient, route of administration, 
dosage form, and strength) are in 
alignment with the GUARD Model 
drug’s identifying characteristics. If the 
full set of international analogs are not 
reported for the GUARD Model drug, 
CMS proposes that the submission is 
not acceptable and thus it would not be 
an applicable submission, unless 
additional information is provided and 
CMS approves the use of the data. 
Specifically, CMS recognizes that given 
the requirement that international 
products be aligned according to all 
their identifying characteristics with the 
GUARD Model drug, it is possible that 
manufacturers would need flexibility in 
reporting for various reasons. For 
example, data processing and lags in 
compiling information (given the 
number of reference countries involved 
and the level of granularity at which the 
data must be submitted—NDC–9 level) 
and administrative lags in receiving data 
on manufacturer discounts and rebates 
(or lags associated with coordinating 
with third-parties that may be involved 
in the sales of the international products 
that are part of the GUARD Model 
drug’s set of international analogs) may 
all pose challenges for submission of the 
international net pricing data at the 
NDC–9 level. Thus, CMS proposes at 
§ 514.310(f) that manufacturers who 
cannot provide the full set of 
international analogs for all reference 
countries where they are sold provide a 
detailed explanation of why this is not 
possible. CMS will consider this 
information as part of the verification 
review process. 
CMS also proposes at § 514.310(b) 
that during the verification process CMS 
may choose to request additional 
supporting information from 
manufacturers before completing its 
assessment of a submission’s validity. In 
this situation, the manufacturer would 
be required to respond to CMS within 
15 days; and if responses are acceptable 
to CMS, CMS will confirm the validity 
of the submission and proceed to use 
the subset of international products for 
which the manufacturer has submitted 
data, as long as it meets all other 
requirements, to represent the set of 
international analogs and thus be used 
to determine the GUARD Model 
updated international benchmark. 
CMS considered the possibility of 
accepting a submission without 
explanation even if the full set of 
international analogs are not included 
in the submission and using the data 
that is submitted along with existing 
international drug pricing information 
to calculate an updated international 
benchmark. However, we decided 
against this approach because of 
concerns about combining different data 
sources and whether it would be logical 
to do so with some adjustments. We 
seek feedback on this potential option. 
CMS also considered providing 
manufacturers the set of international 
analogs for which they must submit the 
international net pricing data. However, 
we believe that manufacturers have this 
information and it would not be 
burdensome to identify the set of 
international analogs that are sold in the 
reference countries. CMS also 
considered not accepting, even with 
appropriate explanation, any 
submission that does not include the 
full set of international analogs for the 
GUARD Model drug. However, we 
decided against this because we believe 
there may be legitimate reasons for a 
manufacturer to be unable to submit this 
information for certain drugs, 
particularly because CMS is requesting 
data at a granular level—the NDC–9 
level—which is necessary because Part 
D drugs are identified by NDC–9 and the 
Part D Inflation Rebate Program is based 
on the same. CMS recognizes that this 
level of granularity may result in 
exceptional situations and 
circumstances where the data for a 
particular NDC–9 is not yet available. 
Therefore, under our proposed policy, 
CMS allows for manufacturers to share 
an explanation that CMS will assess for 
acceptability. CMS seeks feedback on 
our proposed policy as well as the 
alternatives presented, including 
whether CMS should provide the set of 
international analogs for which data 
should be submitted for each 
corresponding GUARD Model drug. 
CMS recognizes the complexities 
inherent in international 
pharmaceutical markets, including 
variations in dosage strengths, 
formulations, and routes of 
administration; packaging differences; 
and diverse relationships between U.S. 
and international entities responsible 
for product marketing and distribution. 
For these reasons, we also considered 
only requesting this data for the set of 
international analogs that correspond to 
a GUARD Model drug that are sold 
directly by the manufacturer and not by 
any other subsidiary or company in the 
reference countries. We also considered 
an option where manufacturers would 
only submit the data for the set of 
international analogs that they directly 
sell in the reference countries. However, 
we believe that manufacturers have 
relationships with subsidiaries, 
wholesalers, and other businesses 
involved in selling the set of 
international analogs in the reference 
countries and can obtain the data that is 
requested under this option. CMS 
welcomes feedback on our policy and 
the alternatives presented. 
CMS seeks comments on whether the 
proposed voluntary framework, which 
includes basic required data elements to 
ensure alignment of GUARD Model 
drugs and international products, 
adequately addresses these market 
complexities. CMS also seeks comments 
on whether additional basic data 
elements should be required or if any of 
the proposed elements present 
significant data collection, analysis, or 
submission challenges. 
3. Options for Submission of Net Pricing 
Data Elements 
CMS proposes in § 514.310(d) that 
manufacturers who elect to submit 
international drug net pricing data must 
submit all of the data elements required 
for one of the two options described 
later in this Section of this proposed 
rule, in addition to the basic data 
elements that are presented in this 
Section of this proposed rule. 
Manufacturers would select which 
option to follow. For each of the two 
options, manufacturers must report data 
elements for the international products 
that comprise the set of international 
analogs that are sold in the set of 
reference countries that correspond to 
the GUARD Model drug and which they

have included in the basic data 
elements. 
a. Streamlined Option 
Under this option, manufacturers 
would be required to report a set of data 
elements at the net price level, reference 
country level, and at an across-country 
level. Beginning with the ‘‘net price 
level’’, CMS proposes at § 514.300 this 
to mean, with respect to sales of 
international products, all sales of an 
international product in a reference 
country at the same price and price 
concession, where ‘‘price concession,’’ 
also defined at § 514.300, means any 
discounts, rebates, or other concessions 
offered by the manufacturer that lowers 
the amount paid for purchase of an 
international product in a reference 
country. Thus, a single international 
product may have multiple net price 
levels in a reference country as it may 
be sold at different prices to different 
purchasers and each purchaser may 
receive different concessions from the 
manufacturer. However, if an 
international product is sold at the same 
price to multiple purchasers and each of 
them receives the same concession, then 
it has only one net price level. 
The three data elements that CMS 
proposes at § 514.310(d) must be 
reported at the net price level are gross 
sales amount, net sales amount, and 
volume in NCPDP units. ‘‘Gross sales 
amount,’’ defined at § 514.300, means 
the amount of money paid, inclusive of 
any price concessions, for the purchase 
of an international product in a 
reference country. In contrast, ‘‘net sales 
amount,’’ defined at § 514.300, means 
the amount of money paid, exclusive of 
any price concessions, for the purchase 
of an international product in a 
reference country. The net sales amount 
is not a list price (for example, the 
equivalent of WAC in the United 
States); rather, it is based on the net 
price of the international products sold 
in the reference countries. 
Both gross and net sales amounts 
must be reported in local country 
currency and in U.S. dollars (details on 
the exchange rate for currency 
conversion are discussed later in this 
Section of this proposed rule). Both of 
these values for an international product 
at the net price level are expected to 
correspond to each other, and will have 
a corresponding volume of the 
international product that was 
purchased. When reporting the volume, 
it must be expressed in NCPDP units or 
converted into NCPDP units that 
correspond to the GUARD Model drug’s 
NCPDP unit. 
Under our proposal, CMS would 
expect the manufacturer to obtain every 
sale that is made directly to health care 
entities, distributors, wholesalers, or 
other international purchasers and 
aggregate those that share a price and 
concession amount, resulting in sales by 
the net price level. We considered the 
option of only requesting sales that 
manufacturers have readily available 
and not all sales made for the set of 
international analogs. However, we 
believe that manufacturers do have 
access to all sales made for the set of 
international analogs that correspond to 
a GUARD Model drug. CMS does allow 
for some flexibility, however, because 
we recognize that there may be sales 
that a manufacturer may not be able to 
provide for a variety of reasons (for 
example, delays in payments of price 
concessions, licensing agreements for 
third party production of products, and 
parallel importing arrangements). We 
describe an approach for how to 
approach this in extenuating 
circumstances in our verification of 
review process that is described later in 
this Section of this proposed rule. 
We also considered, instead of sales, 
requesting manufacturer revenue. 
However, given that the purpose of the 
submission is to determine the GUARD 
Model updated international benchmark 
for a GUARD Model drug, we believe 
sales are the appropriate measure to 
request. We seek feedback on this 
proposal of requesting sales instead of 
another measure and seek comment on 
whether and to what extent 
manufacturers can submit all sales. 
In Table B6, an example of the 
voluntary submission by the 
manufacturer of ‘‘GUARD Model drug I’’ 
is shown and a description of the data 
used is found in Table B5. This 
fictitious GUARD Model drug I has 
international products in three reference 
countries. In reference country A, it has 
two international products; in reference 
country B, it has four; and in reference 
country C, it has 3. For reference 
country A, international product one 
has five net price levels (sold at five 
price-price concession combinations); 
thus, the applicable submission 
includes gross and net sales amounts 
and volume in NCPDP units for each of 
the five levels. Also in reference country 
A, international product two has three 
net price levels; thus, the applicable 
submission includes three gross and net 
sales amounts with the corresponding 
volumes. It is possible that there were 
multiple sales of international analog 
one for each of those net price levels, 
but as the sales were at the same price 
and price concession, the applicable 
submission includes these aggregated at 
the net price level. 
The four data elements that CMS 
proposes at § 514.310(d) for reporting at 
the reference country level are the 
average net-to-gross ratio, the exchange 
rate for currency conversion, the 
country-level average price, and the 
GDP (PPP) adjuster which will be 
further described later in this Section of 
this proposed rule. 
The ‘‘average net-to-gross ratio’’ 
means for a reference country, the total 
net sales for international products that 
are part of a GUARD Model drug’s set 
of international analogs in a reference 
country divided by the corresponding 
total gross sales for the same 
international products. This means that 
there is one average net-to-gross ratio for 
each GUARD Model drug per reference 
country. An example of how the average 
net-to-gross ratio is calculated is shown 
in Table B6, where for Reference 
Country A, the sum of all net sales 
amounts (including both international 
analogs) is divided by the sum of all 
gross sales amounts (including both 
international analogs) resulting in the 
average net-to-gross ratio of 0.55. 
The ‘‘exchange rate for currency 
conversion,’’ defined at § 514.5, means 
the conversion rate used to convert from 
the currency of each reference country 
to U.S. dollars for data corresponding to 
the submission’s performance year. In 
other words, the rate would correspond 
to the calendar year during which the 
sale of international products occurred. 
CMS proposes at § 514.310(e) that the 
exchange rate that should be applied 
would be from the World Bank Atlas,
161
 
and correspond to the submission’s 
corresponding performance year. This 
exchange would be applied to all data 
elements requiring currency conversion 
in the submission. 
CMS considered allowing for different 
possible data sources for the exchange 
rate for currency conversion, for 
instance, the International Monetary 
Fund exchange rates data,
162
the Federal 
Reserve Bank foreign exchange rates,
163

and exchange rates from country- 
specific sources, however CMS believes 
that because the rates would be applied 
across an entire calendar year, it is 
important for the data source to provide 
consistency in reporting and methods. 
The World Bank Atlas provides this by 
considering not just an annual rate, but 
also taking into account the 2 preceding 
years, which adjusts for the difference 
between the rate of inflation in the 
country and international inflation, 
thereby mitigating short-term effects of 
inflation.
164
We solicit feedback on the 
data sources considered and others that 
should be considered for currency 
conversion; the methods that can be 
used; the challenges that might arise; 
and any other pertinent information 
related to this topic. We are also seeking 
feedback on whether CMS should 
provide the exchange rates that are used 
in the calculations. 
The next data element reported at the 
country-level is the country-level net 
price. CMS proposes at § 514.300 that 
‘‘country-level net price’’ means a 
weighted average net price, that 
excludes price concessions, for all 
international products sold in a 
reference country that are part of a 
GUARD Model drug’s set of 
international analogs during a 
submission’s corresponding 
performance year, where the weights are 
the corresponding volumes of 
international products sold, expressed 
as a per unit price, and where the units 
are the GUARD Model drug’s NCPDP 
units. To express the country-level 
average net price in U.S. dollars, the 
exchange rate for currency conversion 
(the rate according to § 514.310(e)) is 
utilized. Using again the example of 
reference country A from Table B6, each 
of the net sales amounts for both 
international products contribute to the 
average according to how much volume 
was sold. The net sales amounts are 
converted from local currency to U.S. 
dollars using the exchange rate of 0.8 
(this is calculated dividing the net sales 
amount by the rate). This results in an 
average price for one NCPDP unit of 
GUARD Model drug I in reference 
country A, which in this example would 
be $187. 
The final country-level data element 
required to be reported under this 
option is the ‘‘GDP (PPP) adjuster,’’ 
which CMS proposes at § 514.5, to 
define as, for a reference country, the 
U.S. GDP (PPP) per capita divided by 
the reference country’s GDP (PPP) per 
capita rounded to the third decimal 
place. The GDP (PPP) per capita for the 
reference country is the most recent 
estimate of GDP (PPP) per capita for that 
reference country available in the CIA 
World Factbook at the end of the 
corresponding performance year. The 
reference country’s GDP (PPP) per 
capita and U.S. GDP (PPP) per capita 
must be for the same calendar year. 
CMS proposes the GDP (PPP) adjuster 
would have a lower bound of 1.000, 
thus if the resulting GDP (PPP) adjuster 
is lower than 1.000, it is set to 1.000. 
CMS proposes a lower bound of 1.000 
for the GDP (PPP) adjuster because CMS 
believes that the adjuster should not 
decrease a country-level average price 
for a drug. Setting this lower bound will 
ensure that an adjustment is not made 
that would result in an adjusted 
country-level average price being lower 
than the unadjusted country-level 
average price. CMS believes that the 
GDP (PPP) adjuster’s purpose is to 
adjust for countries’ economic resources 
when they are higher than those of the 
United States, and the lower bound 
proposal aims to achieves this. To 
exemplify this, Country X has a higher 
GDP (PPP) per capita than the United 
States, such that its GDP (PPP) adjuster 
without a lower bound would be 0.500 
and an unadjusted country-level average 
price for an international product part of 
a GUARD Model drug’s set of 
international analogs of $100. Without 
the proposed lower bound, the adjusted 
price would be $50, but with the 
proposed lower bound the adjusted 
price would remain $100. CMS 
considered not having a lower bound for 
the GDP (PPP) adjuster to allow for 
adjustments when a reference country 
has a higher GDP (PPP) per capita than 
the United States. CMS seeks feedback 
on this policy. 
The single data element reported at an 
across-country level is the across- 
country average net price. At § 514.5, 
CMS proposes ‘‘across-country average 
net price’’ to mean the weighted average 
net price (excluding price concessions) 
for all international products sold across 
all reference countries that are part of 
GUARD Model drug’s set of 
international analogs during a 
submission’s corresponding 
performance year, where the weights are 
the corresponding volumes of the 
international product sold in NCPDP 
units, each price is adjusted using the 
reference country specific GDP (PPP) 
adjuster, converted into U.S. dollars 
using the exchange rate for currency 
conversion as described at § 514.310(e), 
and expressed as a per unit price, where 
the units are the GUARD Model drug’s 
NCPDP units. An example of the across 
country average net price is shown in 
Table B6. Note that there is one value 
across all three reference countries. 
Each net sales amount for all 
international products in every 
reference country contributes to this 
average according to the volume sold. 
Each of the 29 net sales amounts are 
converted to U.S. dollars using the 
appropriate exchange rate (0.8 for the 
net sales amount for reference country 
A, 10 for the 14 net sales amount for 
reference country B, and 0.86 for the 7 
net sales amount for reference country 
C) and adjusted by the reference 
country’s GDP (PPP) adjuster (1.000 for 
reference country A, 1.300 for reference 
country B, and 1.500 for reference 
country C). This results in an average 
price of GUARD Model drug I of 
$182.761. This means that for GUARD 
Model drug I, the average price in all 
reference countries where it is sold is 
$182.761, which accounts for how much 
quantity is sold, the country’s currency, 
and its GDP (PPP). 
We seek feedback on the data 
elements included in this option. 
b. Limited Option 
Under this approach, manufacturers 
would be required to submit a very 
limited set of data elements that are 
aggregated at country-level and one data 
element at the across-country level. 
CMS proposes at § 514.310(d), that the 
country level data elements that would 
be submitted under the limited option 
are the average net-to-gross ratio, the 
exchange rate for currency conversion, 
the country-level average price, and the 
GDP (PPP) adjuster; all these elements 
are the same as described for the 
streamlined option. The one across- 
country level data element that CMS 
proposes at § 514.310(d) to be submitted 
under the limited option is the across- 
country average net price and it is also 
the same as described for the 
streamlined option. Additionally, 
manufacturers would be required to 
submit several other data elements 
under the limited option: the total gross sales amount, total net sales amount, and total volume in NCPDP units, which we describe next. 
For all the international products that 
are part of the set of international 
analogs corresponding to a GUARD 
Model drug, for each reference country, 
CMS would require submission of the 
total gross sales amount, which can be computed by summing all gross sales 
amounts for the international products 
part of the GUARD Model drug’s 
international analogs in the reference 
country’s currency and in U.S. dollars

net sales amounts for the international

drug’s international analogs in the 
reference country’s currency and in U.S. 
dollars (using the exchange rate for 
currency conversion); and the 
corresponding total sales volume in NCPDP units corresponding to the 
GUARD Model drug’s NCPDP unit. 
We seek feedback on the data 
elements included in this option. 
c. Additional Considerations for Both 
Options 
CMS would require information on 
how the data elements were compiled 
and computed, any reasonable 
assumptions that were made during this 
process, and any other pertinent 
information that CMS should consider 
in its verification process for the data. 
CMS proposes that if there are sales that 
the manufacturer has not been able to 
include, the manufacturer submit an 
explanation and CMS will consider this 
as part of the verification review. If the 
explanation is acceptable, CMS may 
consider the submission an applicable 
submission if it meets all other criteria. 
CMS considered not allowing this 
flexibility but given that the data is at 
a granular level (NDC–9), we believe 
that this flexibility is necessary. CMS 
will include in guidance more 
information on how to calculate these 
values and the reasonable assumptions 
manufacturers can make in this process 
under this option. 
CMS recognizes that manufacturers 
may need to allocate gross and net sales 
amounts to the international products 
part of the set of international analogs 
to provide the data elements required 
under each of the options presented 
previously. CMS proposes at 
§ 514.310(b) that any allocation and 
calculations be done in a manner 
consistent with the generally acceptable 
accounting principles (GAAP), 
international financial reporting 
standards (IFRS), or other 
internationally recognized accounting 
approaches.
165
We solicit feedback on 
whether there are other accounting 
approaches that CMS should consider. 
CMS will provide further guidance on 
reasonable assumptions that 
manufacturers may make in the 
calculation of these data elements. 
Though both options require the same 
types of data, they differ in granularity 
of data submitted and CMS’ ability to 
verify the data reported. In the 
streamlined option, CMS would require 
reporting of gross sales amount, net 
sales amount, and volume for each net 
price level. In the limited option, CMS 
would require reporting of less granular 
data with gross sales amount, net sales 
amount and volume reported across all 
net price levels. CMS developed the 
limited option to allow manufacturers to 
report detailed manufacturer net pricing 
data but without having to disaggregate 
at the net price level.

4. Verification of the Submission 
CMS proposes to assess each 
submission for validity as part of the 
verification process. For both options, 
CMS will use existing available 
information, including, for example U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) filings, existing international drug 
pricing data from vendors, as described 
in section IV.E. of this proposed rule, 
reference countries central bank data, 
health ministry or other national 
registries and formularies, and other 
publicly available information to 
determine whether the values reported 
for the data elements fall within 
plausible and reasonable ranges. Some 
examples of publicly available data that 
could serve for the verification process 
are the Schedule of Pharmaceutical 
Benefits of the Australian Government’s 
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
166
and 
the United Kingdom’s National Health 
Service Medicines A to Z
167
and 
Electronic Drug Tariff data.
168
 
As part of the verification process, 
CMS proposes § 514.310(b) to conduct 
some or all of the following checks: 
cross reference check against existing 
international data for the set of 
international analogs; check for internal 
consistency; conduct cross-validation 
using external and public data; conduct 
technical data quality checks; and carry 
out any other appropriate checks for 
verification. CMS proposes to follow a 
resolution process if errors are 
identified, which is described later in 
this Section of this proposed rule. 
To cross reference against existing 
international data for the set of 
international analogs for which data are 
submitted, CMS may compare the 
reported country-level average net 
prices and across-country average net 
price to existing data sources that 
contain gross prices. This will allow 
CMS to assess whether the reported data 
are consistent with existing data. For 
example, if a net price reported by a 
manufacturer is greater than the 
publicly available gross prices reported 
in existing international data sources, 
CMS may request further information. 
CMS believes that if this happens, it 
may be caused by data entry or unit 
error; misclassification of the price that 
is reported (for example, the net price 
estimate may actually reflect an 
intermediate price and not a net price); 
timing mismatch (for example, the net 
price estimate may reflect a different 
timeframe than the GUARD Model 
performance year for which it is 
submitted); inclusion or omission of an 
international product in the set of 
international analogs that is not aligned 
with the GUARD Model drug (for 
example, including international 
products with a dosage form of single- 
use when the GUARD Model drug is a 
multi-dose vial or including 
international products with an oral 
dosage form—for instance a tablet—and 
a strength of 5 mg when the GUARD 
Model drug has an inhaled dosage form 
and a strength of 5 mg); other errors; or 
legitimate reasons that require further 
context. In addition, because some of 
the reference countries use international 
reference pricing, we may also compare 
the reported data against the existing list 
prices or gross prices in other countries 
that use international reference prices. 
This would allow CMS to assess 
whether the data values submitted are 
within a reasonable range. If there are 
questions, CMS may reach out to the 
manufacturer for an explanation and 
make a determination based on the 
explanation. 
In addition, CMS may, as part of the 
verification process and as proposed in 
§ 514.310(b), check for internal 
consistency, which means that CMS 
would examine the full set of data 
submitted along with the explanation of 
how the data was collected or 
calculated, compare with publicly 
available existing data, and make a 
determination about whether the values 
are logically consistent. For example, as 
part of this approach, CMS would 
conduct net-to-gross ratio checks and 
use existing data and research to 
determine whether the values reported 
are within reasonable ranges. Under this

Notes: Ref. Cty. stands for reference country; Int. Prod. stands for international product; Vol. stands for volume; Amt. stands for amount; 
Ave. stands for average; Adj. stands for adjusted; LC stands for local currency; Exch. Rate stands for Exchange Rate for Currency Conversion; NCPDP stands for National Council for Prescription Drug Program; GDP (PPP) stands for gross domestic product based on purchasing power parity. *The volumes in this example are in NCPDP units that correspond to GUARD Model drug 
l's NCPDP unit. In this illustrative example, for GUARD Model I the set of international analogs is composed of two 
international products sold in Country A, four sold in B, and three sold in C. Gross and net sales and volume amounts for the streamlined option are reported at the net price level which means, with respect to sales of international products, sales at the same price and price concession. This means that the gross and net sales and volume are aggregated together as long as they 
correspond to a sale with the same price and price concession regardless of purchaser identity. For the limited option the net price levels are shown but reporting is at a country level hence there is only one gross and net sales and volume amount for each country. The country-level average net price is a weighted average where the weights are the corresponding volume to each price contributing to the average. The across-country average net price is a weighted average where the weights are the corresponding volume to each price contributing to the average and where each price has been multiplied by the appropriate country's GDP (PPP) adjuster. 60377 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules 169
United Kingdom Department of Health and 
Social Care, & Ahmed, Z. (2025). Innovative 
medicines supported as rebate rate falls by a third. 
GOV.UK. https://www.gov.uk/government/news/innovative-medicines-supported-as-rebate-rate- 
falls-by-a-third (Accessed: 10 December 2025). approach, CMS may compare net-to- 
gross ratios of a given GUARD Model 
drug with information from the 
reference countries about the net price 
of the drug. For instance, in the United 
Kingdom, the voluntary scheme for 
branded medicines pricing, access, and 
growth (VPAG) requires pharmaceutical 
companies to pay the National Health 
Services of the United Kingdom, a 
percentage of the sales of branded 
medicines. The percentage for 2025 was 
22.9 percent and for 2026 it will be 
decreased to 14.5 percent.
169
So, for the 
United Kingdom, CMS would not 
expect country-level average net-to- 
gross discounts and rebates to be less 
than 0.15. CMS seeks comment as to 
whether a net-to-gross ratio tolerance 
should be considered or if a specific 
tolerance level should be defined. 
In addition, CMS may consider 
temporal logic in assessing the validity 
of the data reported. For example, any 
changes in net price should track market 
events. CMS may examine historical 
publicly available data to determine 
whether the data submitted is 
reasonable. CMS encourages 
manufacturers to submit historical net 
price data, but CMS decided against 
making this a requirement due to the 
burden it might impose on 
manufacturers. CMS seeks feedback on 
whether this should be a required data 
element. 
CMS may also conduct technical data 
quality checks. This includes but is not 
limited to verification that the data 
reported are in consistent units; the time 
period aligns with the GUARD Model 
performance year for which it is 
submitted; any sales-weighting is done 
appropriately; the data is submitted in 
the correct currency; and that any 
rounding and scaling is applied 
consistently and according to guidance. 
CMS may also conduct cross- 
validation using external and public 
data. This means that CMS may check 
the data submitted against market data 
or any other relevant public data, 
including but not limited to financial 
filings in the United States as well as in 
reference countries. CMS may also 
review how the manufacturer has 
described the aggregation and weighting 
process for the set of international 
analogs that correspond to a GUARD 
Model drug for which the data was 
submitted. If there are concerns with the 
logic of how the data was aggregated, 
how the sales were allocated, or any 
other methodological concern, CMS 
may reach out to the manufacturer with 
questions. If the manufacturer is able to 
provide an explanation that is 
reasonable as assessed by CMS, CMS 
may consider the submission an 
applicable submission. 
To facilitate the validation process, 
CMS recommends that manufacturers 
provide details for how they calculated 
the data elements for their selected 
option and any reasonable assumptions 
they made in the calculations. As part 
of the validity assessment, CMS may 
reach out to manufacturers with 
questions or request more information. 
CMS proposes at § 514.310(b) that 
manufacturers must respond to any 
questions related to the verification 
review in 15 calendar days. If a 
manufacturer does not respond, CMS 
will consider the submission to be 
unacceptable. 
5. Alternatives Considered for the 
Submission Options 
CMS considered offering a more 
comprehensive option for 
manufacturers to submit the 
international net pricing data. Under 
this option, in addition to the data 
elements noted in the previous options, 
manufacturers would have been 
required to submit more granular 
information. Specifically, in addition to 
submitting net sales amount at the net 
price level, manufacturers would be 
required to submit the corresponding 
price concessions at the net price level. 
However, we decided not to offer this 
option due to concerns around burden 
and challenges that manufacturers may 
experience in submitting data elements 
that are more detailed than the proposed 
options. 
CMS also considered offering an 
option that allows manufacturers to 
submit, for the entire set of international 
analogs that correspond to a GUARD 
Model drug, only total gross revenue, 
total net revenue, and total volume 
across all reference countries. However, 
we decided against including this 
option in the proposal because CMS’ 
ability to perform any verification 
would be limited. 
We also considered whether, instead 
of manufacturers, CMS should calculate 
the country-level average net price and 
across-country average net price. We 
decided against this policy because we 
believe that the burden related to doing 
the calculations is minimal. In addition, 
we considered whether to require the 
manufacturer to also identify the lowest 
net price (and the reference country 
with this price) among the set of 
reference countries for the set of 
international analogs that correspond to 
a GUARD Model drug. However, as this 
information is already part of the 
submission, we did not believe it was 
necessary. We seek feedback on these 
policies. 
In offering the two options noted 
previously, CMS balanced multiple 
policy priorities, including 
administrative burden for manufacturers 
and CMS; the need for complete and 
valid data submissions; and potential 
concerns that may arise from disclosing 
detailed international drug pricing 
information. CMS recognizes that 
manufacturers may encounter 
challenges in submission of the 
voluntary net pricing data for a number 
of reasons, including, for example, due 
to the way contracts are structured (for 
example, timing or the bundle of drugs 
included in sales contracts); the 
relationships that manufacturers may 
have with subsidiaries that sell drugs in 
the reference countries; and for other 
reasons. CMS seeks feedback on the 
types of relationships and arrangements 
manufacturers within U.S. have with 
the distributors, purchasers or other 
entities involved in the supply chain of 
the international analogs that 
correspond to a GUARD Model drug in 
the set of reference countries that may 
pose a challenge for manufacturers to 
compile and collect these data elements. 
We also seek feedback on other 
challenges that manufacturers may face 
in compiling and calculating these data 
elements and suggestions to address 
these challenges. CMS also seeks 
comments on whether there are specific 
data reporting issues CMS should 
consider, including existing 
mechanisms that could reduce data 
reporting and collection burden. We 
also seek comments on the voluntary 
framework and the proposed options, 
including the alternative options 
considered, to report net pricing 
information for international analogs 
that correspond to the GUARD Model 
drugs. 
6. Attestation and Submission 
CMS proposes that submitted data 
must comply with data requirements as 
proposed at § 514.310(b). Each 
submission must include an attestation 
by an authorized representative where 
they certify the completeness and 
validity of the data submission on 
behalf of the manufacturer and any 
third-party entities relied upon for 
gathering, analyzing, or submitting the 
manufacturer net pricing data, as 
proposed at § 514.310(g)(2). At 
§ 514.300, CMS proposes to define 
‘‘authorized representative’’ as an 
individual, designated by a 
manufacturer, as responsible for

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360378 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules submitting international drug net 
pricing data, and who is also 
responsible for managing all 
communications related to the 
submission on behalf of the 
manufacturer. Authorized 
representatives must provide their 
contact information and attest that the 
submission is accurate and complete to 
the best of the manufacturer’s 
knowledge, the submission is prepared 
in full compliance with all the 
requirements of § 514.310(b), and 
submitted with proper authority on 
behalf of the manufacturer. If a 
submission does not include the 
attestation as described, it would not be 
considered complete. 
At § 514.310(h), CMS proposes to 
maintain confidentiality of information 
submitted under this section to the 
extent permitted by law and in 
accordance with applicable privacy and 
security requirements. CMS proposes 
that the data submission and attestation 
process would occur through the CMS 
Health Plan and Management System 
(HPMS), which is currently used for the 
Manufacturer Discount Program and the 
Drug Price Negotiation Program 
reporting, or another existing CMS data 
system that would be adapted for this 
purpose at § 514.310(i). We would adapt 
the existing functionality that has been 
used for the Part D Inflation Rebate 
Program, the Medicare Drug Price 
Negotiation Program, or other existing 
CMS program to the extent feasible. 
Leveraging existing technology and 
systems will facilitate executing the data 
agreements and attestations, creating 
data layouts for the various data 
submission pathways, and ensure 
stakeholder confidence that the data 
will be safely transmitted and securely 
stored. Further, using existing 
infrastructure also provides established 
safeguards comparable to other 
government price reporting 
mechanisms. 
CMS recognizes the market-sensitive 
nature of international pricing data and 
proposes to maintain confidentiality to 
the extent allowable under law. CMS 
seeks comments on additional privacy 
safeguards CMS should consider for 
international pricing data submissions. 
7. Timing, Corrections, and 
Resubmissions 
As discussed previously, CMS 
proposes at § 514.310(b) that if the 
manufacturer is electing to submit 
international drug net pricing 
information, the data submission must 
occur within 180 calendar days after the 
end of a performance year and the data 
that is contained within the submission 
must correspond to the performance 
year for which the data may be used to 
determine the GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark. Recognizing 
potential challenges in international 
pricing data compilation, CMS is 
proposing to allow corrections and 
restatements of applicable submissions 
within 15 calendar days of the 
submission deadline. Following the 
previous example of the first 
performance year ending on December 
31, 2027, where the manufacturers have 
to submit by June 29, 2028, at the latest, 
revisions are due July 14, 2028, at the 
latest. CMS may also request corrections 
or amendments, requiring eligible entity 
response within 15 calendar days of the 
request. CMS seeks comments on the 
sufficiency and appropriateness of 
proposed timelines. 
In developing this policy, CMS also 
considered alternatives such as a longer 
timeline for submission of international 
drug net pricing information as 
manufacturers may need additional time 
for reconciliation of pricing data after 
the end of the calendar year. CMS 
understands that this process may vary 
widely by manufacturer and by 
reference country. As such, CMS seeks 
comments on whether the proposed 
timeline could create challenges for 
manufacturers submitting pricing data 
and how such challenges could be 
mitigated. 
G. Determination of the GUARD Model 
Applicable International Benchmark 
In this Section of this proposed rule, 
CMS describes the proposed approach 
to determine the GUARD Model 
applicable international benchmark that 
would be used to generate the GUARD 
Model rebate payment and test the 
alternative rebate calculation approach, 
as described in Section IV.H. of this 
proposed rule. In § 514.5, CMS proposes 
that the ‘‘GUARD Model applicable 
international benchmark’’ means, for 
each GUARD Model drug, the greater of 
the GUARD Model default international 
benchmark and, if available, the GUARD 
Model updated international 
benchmark; and for which an applicable 
adjustment factor has been applied. 
We propose at § 514.5 that for each 
GUARD Model drug, the ‘‘GUARD 
Model default international benchmark’’ 
(also known as Method I) means for 
each GUARD Model drug, the lowest 
price in a set of country-level average 
prices calculated, using the steps 
proposed at § 514.410(c), for each 
reference country identified at 
§ 514.220(d), where international drug 
pricing data is available from selected 
data sources per § 514.210 for at least 
one reference country and at least one 
reference country-level average price 
can be calculated. If the country-level 
average price is a weighted-average, the 
weights are the corresponding volume 
for a price expressed in the terms of the 
NCPDP unit corresponding to the 
GUARD Model drug. In other words, the 
GUARD Model default international 
benchmark would be the lowest among 
a set of country-level average prices 
which are either volume-weighted or 
not, depending on data availability, and 
are adjusted by the reference country’s 
specific GDP (PPP) adjuster, per the 
steps proposed at § 514.410(c). 
As mentioned previously, the other 
possible benchmark is the ‘‘GUARD 
Model updated international 
benchmark’’ (also referred to as Method 
II) which is defined at § 514.5 to mean, 
for each GUARD Model drug, the across- 
country average net price, which is a 
volume-weighted average across all 
reference countries, identified at 
§ 514.220(d), where an international 
product that is part of the set of 
international analogs is sold, and 
includes GDP (PPP) adjustments; the 
across-country average net price is part 
of an applicable submission of 
international drug net pricing data by 
manufacturers according to § 514.310. 
Thus, it is an average net price across all 
international products that are part of 
the set of international analogs for a 
GUARD Model drug and all reference 
countries where these international 
products are sold for which data is 
available, weighted by volume in 
NCPDP units, expressed as the price for 
one, and adjusted by the reference 
country’s specific GDP (PPP) adjuster. 
1. Calculation of the GUARD Model 
Default International Benchmark 
CMS proposes to calculate for every 
GUARD Model drug, a GUARD Model 
default international benchmark, in 
advance of determining the GUARD 
Model rebate amount for the first 
performance year. If after the first 
performance year, CMS identifies a new 
GUARD Model drug for any of the 4 
subsequent performance years, then 
CMS would calculate a GUARD Model 
default international benchmark for the 
new GUARD Model drug, as described 
in this Section of this proposed rule, 
prior to the GUARD Model rebate 
payment calculation, as described in 
section IV.H. of this proposed rule, but 
not for any of the GUARD Model drugs 
which already have a GUARD Model 
default international benchmark for the 
previous performance year. 
By proposing at § 514.410(c) that once 
a GUARD Model default international 
benchmark is established, it is not 
changed, the possibility of having no 
international drug pricing data for one

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360379 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules or a number of GUARD Model drugs 
during a subsequent performance year, 
while others continue to have data, 
would be minimized. While CMS 
recognizes that there can be varying 
reasons for data discontinuity, if the 
GUARD Model drug continues to be 
sold during the GUARD Model 
performance period, CMS seeks to 
mitigate the possibility that lack of data 
for subsequent performance years is due 
to manufacturers’ limiting availability of 
international drug pricing data. 
In addition, by not changing the 
GUARD Model default international 
benchmark, any changes to gross prices 
in reference countries that do not 
necessarily represent increases in net 
prices—for example, due to 
accompanying increases to price 
concessions—would not impact the 
GUARD Model test, mitigating the 
possibility of price manipulation in 
reference countries. 
For the same reasons, CMS believes 
that GUARD Model drugs that first 
qualify as such after the first 
performance year should be subject to 
the same process; thus, determination of 
their GUARD Model default 
international benchmark would take 
place prior to GUARD Model rebate 
payment determination for the earliest 
subsequent performance year when they 
qualify as GUARD Model drugs and 
then not change for the remainder of the 
GUARD Model performance period. 
a. Identifying the Set of International 
Analogs 
For calculation of the GUARD Model 
default international benchmark, CMS 
proposes in § 514.410(c) to use the 
selected data source of international 
drug pricing data to identify data for the 
set of international analogs that align 
with each GUARD Model drug. This 
involves identifying international 
products whose identifying 
characteristics align, as determined by 
CMS, with those of the GUARD Model 
drug. The identifying characteristics are 
active ingredient(s), route of 
administration, dosage form, and 
strength. The alignment of the 
characteristics would be achieved using 
the standardized method for 
differentiating products across these 
dimensions intrinsic to the data source 
(or sources) selected for use according to 
§ 514.210(b). 
To facilitate this identification, CMS 
would make adjustments as necessary, 
for example, by measurement unit 
conversion factors, so that the 
international products for a given 
GUARD Model drug are consistent with 
one another and with the GUARD 
Model drug’s NCPDP unit. These 
adjustments would not affect CMS’ 
determination that the set of 
international analogs—composed of the 
international products with adjustments 
if needed—are aligned with the GUARD 
Model drug. CMS will use all available 
information to ensure that adjustments 
are appropriate. Examples of 
information sources are FDA sources, 
such as approved product labels, the 
Drugs@FDA regulatory approval database, the Purple Book and Orange 
Book, and the NDC Directory, the 
National Library of Medicine’s RxNorm 
database, and the selected data source(s) 
documentation. 
A more detailed description of the 
identification process follows here. To 
begin, CMS would identify from the 
selected data source(s), all of the 
international products whose 
identifying characteristics (active 
ingredient(s), route of administration, 
dosage form, and strength) are aligned 
with the GUARD Model drug, without 
any adjustments. 
Next, for international products where 
their identifying characteristics do not 
exactly align with the GUARD Model 
drug’s characteristics, standard 
adjustments that do not materially 
change the drug’s characteristics would 
be applied. These include, for example, 
applying measurement unit conversion 
factors, removing prefixed or suffixes 
from active ingredient names, matching 
scientific names to active ingredient(s), 
and checking for idiosyncratic 
differences in spelling or formatting. For 
example, as an illustrative case, this 
means that if a data source has the 
chemical name (2S)-2-amino-3-(3,4- 
dihydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, this 
would be equivalent and aligned to the 
active ingredient, levodopa. Any 
potential international products that, 
after these standard adjustments, are 
aligned across all their identifying 
characteristics to the GUARD Model 
drug, would be considered satisfactorily 
aligned. 
For any international products that, 
after the standard adjustments, are still 
not aligned across all identifying 
characteristics of a GUARD Model drug, 
CMS would conduct further review. 
Specifically, CMS would determine 
whether any differences in identifying 
characteristics can be considered 
insignificant because, for example, they 
are attributable to the selected data 
source(s) internal record keeping or 
reference country specific 
considerations. 
An example of a difference between 
product characteristics that CMS would 
consider equivalent related to a data 
source’s internal record keeping is 
where a drug has the dosage form 
characteristic described as a disposable 
vial in some countries but in others, the 
dosage form is a single-dose vial. 
Disposable vials are single-dose vials 
(which are not multi-dose vials). In this 
case, CMS would determine that the 
potential international analogs with 
both dosage forms, disposable vial and 
single-dose vial, are aligned with the 
GUARD Model drug described at the 
NDC–9 level as having a single-dose vial 
dosage form. As another example, CMS 
could determine that, for a GUARD 
Model drug with an extended release 
oral solid formulation, all international 
products sharing the same active general 
form (extended release oral solids) with 
dosage strengths measured on the same 
basis (for example, active ingredient 
mass per unit) as the GUARD Model 
drug could qualify as international 
analogs, even if the data source used by 
CMS further differentiates between 
different subcategories of extended 
release oral solids (such as tablets and 
capsules). 
An example of country-specific 
considerations that CMS would take 
into account relates to the names of 
active ingredients. Although not a 
GUARD Model drug, in the U.S. and 
Japan, acetaminophen is an active 
ingredient, while in most other 
countries, instead of being called 
acetaminophen, it is referred to as 
paracetamol. In this case, CMS would 
consider acetaminophen and 
paracetamol aligned for the active 
ingredient characteristic. 
Next, for any GUARD Model drug that 
is still not aligned with international 
products across all identifying 
characteristics (after the standard 
adjustments and review for non- 
significant differences), CMS would 
conduct further review. CMS proposes 
to further examine international 
products where the remaining 
misalignment is only in strength (this 
means the GUARD Model drug and the 
international products align in terms of 
active ingredient, route of 
administration, and dosage form) for 
cases when there is no other 
international product already aligned 
for a GUARD Model drug in a reference 
country. In other words, for reference 
countries where the GUARD Model 
drug’s set of international analogs has at 
least one fully aligned international 
product, strength-misaligned 
international products would not be 
considered. However, for reference 
countries where the GUARD Model 
drug’s set of international analogs has 
no fully aligned international products, 
strength-misaligned international 
products will be further considered 
depending on the number of strength- 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  19:09 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\23DEP3.SGM 23DEP3
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360380 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules misaligned international products 
available. 
If there is only one strength- 
misaligned international product within 
a reference country, then it would be 
included in the set of international 
analogs for the GUARD Model drug and 
be used in determining the GUARD 
Model default international benchmark. 
If there is more than one strength 
misaligned-international analog product 
for a given reference country, CMS 
would find the relative difference in 
terms of strength between the two 
closest (in absolute terms) international 
analog product strengths to the GUARD 
Model drug’s strength and compare it to 
the relative difference in prices for those 
same two strength-misaligned 
international products, unless the 
higher strength international product 
has a lower or equal price to that of the 
lower strength international product, in 
which case both international products 
are included in the set of international 
analogs. For example, if the GUARD 
Model drug’s strength is 12 mg, and 
there are two strength-misaligned 
international analog products with 
strengths of 10 mg and 20 mg, their 
relative strength difference would be (20 
mg-10 mg)/10 mg or 100 percent. If the 
prices for those same two strength- 
misaligned international products were 
$2.00 per NCPDP unit for the 20 mg 
strength and $1.25 per NCPDP unit for 
the 10 mg strength, their relative price 
difference would be ($2.00–$1.25)/$1.25 
or 60 percent. If instead the prices of 
those same two strength-misaligned 
international products were reversed, 
meaning the price of the 20 mg strength 
was $1.25 and the price of the 10 mg 
strength was $2.00, then the price of the 
larger strength international product is 
lower than that of the lower strength 
international product and therefore both 
the 10 and 20 mg strength international 
products would be included in the set 
of international analogs and the 
comparison between relative differences 
of strengths and prices would not be 
considered. 
In cases where the comparison of the 
relative difference in strengths to the 
relative difference in prices is 
considered, there are two potential 
options: 
€If the relative price difference is equal to or greater than half of the 
relative strength difference within a 
reference country, then CMS would 
include in the set of international 
analogs, the international product 
whose strength is closest in magnitude 
to the strength of the GUARD Model 
drug (in that reference country, and in 
absolute terms, with ties defaulting to 
the lower-strength international 
product). For the above 10 mg and 20 
mg example for an arbitrary reference 
country and a GUARD Model drug with 
a strength of 12 mg, this means that the 
10 mg international product would be 
included in the set of international 
analogs for the GUARD Model drug 
(because 10 mg is closer to 12 mg in 
absolute terms than 20 mg). 
€If the relative price difference is less than half of the relative strength 
difference, then both of the strength- 
misaligned international products with 
the closest strengths in absolute terms to 
the GUARD Model drug would be 
included in the set of international 
analogs for the GUARD Model drug. In 
the example noted previously, if the 
strength-misaligned international 
product with a strength of 20 mg has a 
starting price of $1.50 instead of $2.00, 
then the relative price difference is 20 
percent, which is less than 50 percent. 
In this case, both the 10 mg and 20 mg 
international products would be 
included in the set of international 
analogs with their prices as observed in 
the data source and be part of the 
calculation of the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark. 
Last, CMS may determine that 
potential international products are 
aligned with a GUARD Model drug and 
therefore would be included in the set 
of international analogs based on other 
factors, as long as they do not materially 
differ from the GUARD Model drug and 
if necessary, CMS would make 
methodologically appropriate 
adjustments for such inclusions. For 
example, for a strength-misaligned 
GUARD Model drug with more than one 
active ingredient, if there are 
combination products with the same set 
of active ingredients but different 
configurations of dosage strength in 
other countries, CMS could determine 
that the international products are 
sufficiently aligned with the GUARD 
Model drug. 
Any potential international products 
that are still not aligned with a GUARD 
Model drug with respect to its 
identifying characteristics after the 
process described previously, would not 
be included in the set of international 
analogs used for calculation of the 
GUARD Model default international 
benchmark. CMS believes that, using 
the identification process described 
previously, we will be able to identify 
sets of international analogs for each 
GUARD Model drug to the extent to 
which the existing data sources of 
international drug pricing data, selected 
according to § 514.210(c), include such 
international analogs for the reference 
countries, identified in § 514.220(d). 
Under the proposed approach, CMS 
would identify international analogs 
that are aligned with each GUARD 
Model drug, accounting for country- 
specific or data source idiosyncratic 
differences. CMS seeks comment on the 
alignment process, the strength- 
misalignment strategy for cases with no 
other international products in the set of 
international analogs, and on other 
adjustments that could be considered. 
b. Exclusion of International Products 
From the Set of International Analogs 
For each GUARD Model drug, once 
we have identified a set of international 
analogs that are aligned to the GUARD 
Model drug, CMS proposes at 
§ 514.410(c)(3)(i) to exclude any 
international products identified in the 
selected data source as being an 
international generic or international 
biosimilar biological product according 
to the reference country’s regulatory 
framework. This means that if the 
international product has sales in 
multiple reference countries, the data 
for the reference countries where it is 
classified in the data source as an 
international generic or an international 
biosimilar biological product based on 
the own-country’s regulatory system 
would be excluded. The data for the 
reference countries where they are not 
classified as such would be retained. 
By excluding international generics 
and international biosimilar biological 
products among international products, 
CMS aims to keep the differences 
between the GUARD Model drugs— 
which do not include any generics or 
biosimilar biological products—and 
their set of international analogs as 
limited as possible to just the country of 
sale and price. CMS believes that this is 
reasonable because it means there are no 
generics or biosimilar biological 
products among either the GUARD 
Model drugs or the corresponding set of 
international analogs. 
We considered the option of 
including international products in the 
set of international analogs even if they 
are categorized as international generics 
and international biosimilar biological 
products, according to a reference 
country’s regulatory framework. 
However, CMS believes that given the 
exclusion of sole-source generics and all 
biosimilar biological products from the 
GUARD Model, doing the same among 
international products results in 
appropriately matching GUARD Model 
drugs to their corresponding 
international products. We seek 
feedback on this approach. 
CMS proposes at § 514.410(c)(3)(i) to 
exclude an international product from 
being part of the set of international 
analogs for a GUARD Model drug if in 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  19:09 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\23DEP3.SGM 23DEP3
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360381 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules the selected data source, its pricing 
information (price, sales, or volume) 
aggregated for the entire period 
observed has a value of zero or less than 
zero. Exclusion of these international 
products is necessary because they 
would not contribute to the calculation 
of the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark. We expect 
that this exclusion would affect very 
few international products given the 
data selection requirements from section 
IV.E. of this proposed rule. 
CMS considered excluding an 
international analog in a reference 
country where the amount of sales 
dollars or the number of units sold for 
the entire 12-month period for that 
reference country was under a specific 
threshold. CMS believes that it is not 
necessary to apply exclusions based on 
total annual sales or units sold amounts 
in a reference country because small 
magnitudes of sales or units sold are 
valid data points; in the interest of 
improving precision of the GUARD 
Model default international benchmark, 
CMS believes this data should be 
utilized. 
c. Other Considerations for the Sets of 
International Analogs 
Data for the set of international 
analogs for all reference countries where 
it is sold for each GUARD Model drug, 
to the extent that the data is available in 
the selected data source(s), must be 
expressed in the GUARD Model drug’s 
unit—the minimum possible dosing 
unit in a NCPDP standard. To achieve 
this, CMS would convert the 
international analog volume data from 
the selected data source’s dosing unit to 
the corresponding NCPDP standard 
dosing unit. For example, assume that 
for the selected period in reference 
country Y, 100 units of an international 
analog A were sold. In the selected data 
source, the unit for international analog 
A is described as milliliter; the dosage 
form describes a syringe; and the pack 
size describes a two-ml syringe. As for 
the GUARD Model drug’s unit, it is an 
each, which corresponds to 2-ml 
syringes. Thus, a conversion is needed. 
In this case, 50 units of international 
analog A were sold in reference country 
Y, in terms of NCPDP units. 
Additionally, sales and prices would 
be expressed in U.S. dollars. Since data 
for the set of international analogs for 
each GUARD Model drug is across one 
or more reference countries, it is 
possible that the selected data source 
expresses prices and sales amounts in 
U.S. dollars, local currency, or some 
other standard currency. Using the 
selected data source’s exchange rates for 
currency conversion, all prices and sales 
amounts would be converted to U.S. 
dollars. 
d. Process To Calculate GUARD Model 
Default International Benchmark 
For each GUARD Model drug, CMS 
proposes at § 514.410(c)(iii) the steps to 
calculate a country-level average price 
for each reference country where 
international products part of the set of 
international analogs for a GUARD 
Model drug are sold, and among this set 
of country-level average prices, the 
lowest would be the GUARD Model 
default international benchmark. The 
calculation of the country-level average 
prices would use data for a GUARD 
Model drug’s set of international 
analogs which includes international 
products for each reference country for 
the selected 12-month period per 
§ 514.210; these data would be 
identified as outlined in 
§ 514.410(c)(3)(i), converted (if 
necessary) to be in the appropriate 
GUARD Model drug’s NCPDP unit, and 
converted (if necessary) into U.S. 
dollars. 
The set of country-level average prices 
is composed either of average prices or 
volume-weighted average prices and 
each price of the set is a unitary price. 
If volume data is available, weights 
would be used to obtain the volume- 
weighted average, where the weights are 
in terms of volume as measured in 
NCPDP units; if volume data is not 
available then simply average prices 
would be calculated. 
If volume data is available, the steps 
CMS proposes for calculating the 
country-level average price for a 
reference country, per 
§ 514.410(c)(3)(iii), are as follows: 
€First, each price (in U.S. dollars) for an international analog in a reference 
country will be multiplied by its 
corresponding volume (in NCPCP units 
corresponding with the GUARD Model 
drug unit) to obtain a weighted-price. If 
instead of a price, the selected data 
source provides sales amounts, then 
each sales amount (in U.S. dollars and 
for NCPDP units) is the weighted-price. 
The weighted-price is multiplied by the 
GDP (PPP) adjuster as defined at § 514.5. 
€Second, CMS will calculate the reference country total weighted-price 
by adding up the weighted-prices from 
the first step, and the reference country 
total volume by adding up the volumes 
in NCPDP units. 
€Third, CMS will divide total weighted-price and total volume from 
step two, obtaining the reference 
country’s volume-weighted average 
price for one NCPDP unit of the 
international analog. 
This process is repeated for each 
reference country, resulting in a set of 
country-level average prices from which 
the lowest in absolute terms is selected 
as the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark for the GUARD 
Model drug. 
If volume data is not available—that 
is, the selected data source only has 
price data—then, CMS proposes to 
calculate the average price for a 
reference country at § 514.410(c)(3)(iii) 
by first ensuring all prices for a 
reference country are converted, if 
necessary, into the GUARD Model drug 
NCPDP unit, then expressed in terms of 
a unitary price (the price for one NCPDP 
unit), and multiplied by the GDP (PPP) 
adjuster as defined at § 514.5. Next, all 
these prices are added together and 
divided by the number of prices 
available resulting in a reference 
country’s average price for one NCPDP 
unit. This process is repeated for each 
reference country, resulting in a set of 
country-level average prices from which 
the lowest in absolute terms is selected 
as the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark for the GUARD 
Model drug. 
CMS considered excluding from the 
set of country-level average prices, those 
prices that are less than 5 or 10 percent 
of the GUARD Model drug’s 
‘‘performance year Medicare net price’’ 
which, as described in section IV.H.2. of 
this proposed rule and defined at 
§ 514.5, is a per unit net price for the 
GUARD Model drug during the 
performance year, expressed in terms of 
NCPDP units calculated according to 
§ 514.510(b) using the WAC, 
manufacturer direct and indirect 
remuneration (DIR), discounts from the 
Manufacturer Discount Program, and 
quantity dispensed across all PDE 
records associated with the GUARD 
Model drug during a performance year. 
As an example, if a GUARD Model 
drug’s performance year Medicare net 
price is $120 and the set of country- 
level average prices that resulted from 
the international products included in 
the set of international analogs is $20, 
$10, and $5. The exclusion of country- 
level average prices that are less than 5 
percent of the performance year 
Medicare net price would mean that 
prices less than $6 would be excluded, 
therefore only the $20 and $10 prices 
would remain in the set to be used in 
calculating the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark. The exclusion 
of volume-weighted average prices that 
are less than 10 percent of the 
performance year Medicare net price 
would mean that prices less than $12 
would be excluded, therefore only the 
$20 price would remain in the set to be

Model default international benchmark. 
However, CMS believes that including 
all available data increases accuracy and 
precision so we have not proposed this 
approach. 
CMS also considered using an across 
country average instead of the lowest 
country average and using averages 
without volume-weighting for 
calculating the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark. However, an 
across country average does not 
represent an actual price paid for a 
GUARD Model drug in the reference 
countries, and using averages without 
volume-weighting, when volume is 
available, does not best reflect the 
typical price in a country because the 
amount a price should influence a 
country’s average should correspond to 
how much of that country’s sales 
volume is sold at that price. 
In summary, the GUARD Model 
default international benchmark is the 
lowest (reference) country-level average 
price in U.S. dollars across international 
products included in a GUARD Model 
drug’s set of international analogs sold 
in that reference country. It is calculated 
using international drug pricing data 
from selected data sources, excluding 
any international generics or 
international biosimilar biological 
products given the reference country’s 
regulatory framework. 
The GUARD Model default 
international benchmark is calculated 
for all GUARD Model drugs after the 
first performance year when they are 
included—and prior to that performance 
year’s GUARD Model rebate payment 
determination. Once a GUARD Model 
default international benchmark has 
been calculated, it will serve as the 
GUARD Model default international 
benchmark for the remainder of the 
GUARD Model performance period. We 
welcome comment on this proposal and 
the alternatives presented. 
2. Identification of the GUARD Model 
Updated International Benchmark 
CMS proposes to determine, for every 
GUARD Model drug with an applicable 
submission of international drug net 
pricing data, a GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark (also referred 
to as Method II) in advance of the 
GUARD Model rebate payment 
determination, for every performance 
year for which an applicable submission 
is received, as described in section IV.F. 
of this proposed rule. 
In the case where a GUARD Model 
drug has a GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark for a 
performance year, but for the next 
performance year, CMS does not receive 
an applicable submission—for the next 
performance year and any subsequent 
performance years where there is no 
applicable submission, CMS proposes to 
utilize the default international 
benchmark. This is because for there to 
be a GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark for a 
performance year, there must be a 
corresponding applicable submission 
covering the dates for that performance 
year. Thus, for any subsequent 
performance year without an applicable 
submission, regardless of whether at any 
point previously in the GUARD Model 
performance period there was an 
applicable submission, CMS proposes 
that there would be no GUARD Model 
updated international benchmark. 
By proposing that the GUARD Model 
updated international benchmark be 
limited to the performance year for 
which the applicable submission is 
received, CMS believes the most recent 
net price data should be used and that 
there would be no concerns regarding 
availability of net pricing data should a 
manufacturer choose to submit it. 
Manufacturer submitted data would 
therefore be for the same period as the 
one CMS would use to obtain the 
performance year Medicare net price, as 
discussed in section IV.H.2.a. of this 
proposed rule, which would be used to 
calculate the GUARD Model rebate 
amount for that performance year. CMS 
considered but decided against, using a 
GUARD Model updated international 
benchmark from a previous performance 
year—meaning it would have been 
determined from manufacturer 
submitted data for a previous 
performance year—because, given the 
voluntary nature of the data submission, 
the main focus is on ensuring the data 
is the most reflective of the specific 
performance year to which it 
corresponds. CMS seeks feedback on 
this approach. 
Additionally, CMS believes that since 
the GUARD Model test would only 
determine a GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark if there is an 
applicable submission and otherwise 
would use the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark, it would 
encourage manufacturers to voluntarily 
submit data, which increases 
transparency. 
CMS proposes in § 514.410(d) that the 
GUARD Model updated international 
benchmark would be the across-country 
average net price data element part of 
the applicable submission. This average 
is across the reference countries where 
international products that are part of 
the set of international analogs are sold 
in each of the reference countries; it is 
volume-weighted using the volume— 
units in NCPDP equivalent; and GDP 
(PPP)-adjusted to account for country- 
level differences. CMS would obtain 
this average from the manufacturer’s 
submission, if it is deemed applicable. 
The use of an across-country average net 
price for the GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark instead of the 
lowest country average as in the GUARD 
Model default international benchmark 
is due to the differing nature of the 
prices. For the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark, the set of 
prices are derived from the selected data 
source are likely to be ex-manufacturer 
prices—prices paid to the manufacturer 
by wholesalers and other distributers— 
but this is not guaranteed; they could 
potentially represent prices based on a 
distribution channel, or another 
variation, as described in section IV.E. 
of this proposed rule. Given the 
increased likelihood that prices are 
consistent within country but not 
necessarily across countries (due to 
using the best available data, which 
could still potentially be derived from 
different sources) and the nature of the 
prices (for example, depending on the 
time period and reference country), 
CMS believes it is preferable to select a 
country price and not average across 
countries when using the existing 
international data source. For the 
GUARD Model updated international 
benchmark, the net pricing data is 
reported by the manufacturer who is 
able to observe actual net prices, so we 
believe it is acceptable to use an 
average. We seek feedback on this 
approach. 
3. Adjustment of the Applicable 
International Benchmark 
In § 514.410(b), CMS proposes to 
determine the ‘‘GUARD Model 
applicable international benchmark’’ for 
each GUARD Model drug by identifying 
the greater of between the default 
international benchmark and the 
updated international benchmark and 
then applying an applicable adjustment 
factor. We propose at § 514.410(e), that 
when the GUARD Model applicable 
international benchmark is based on the 
GUARD Model default international 
benchmark, the applicable adjustment 
factor is 102 percent; if it is based on the 
GUARD Model updated international 
benchmark, the applicable adjustment 
factor is 105 percent. CMS also proposes 
the GUARD Model default international 
benchmark and the corresponding 
applicable adjustment factor would be 
used when there is no GUARD Model 
updated international benchmark for a 
performance year. Table B7 provides an 
illustrative example of how CMS would 
determine the GUARD Model applicable

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360383 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules international benchmark for a fictious 
GUARD Model drug during the 
performance period. 
CMS believes that a 2 percent 
adjustment for the GUARD Model 
default international benchmark 
accounts for potential differences 
between the U.S. market and markets in 
the set of reference countries for which 
international drug pricing information is 
available. Although the proposed 
calculation for the GUARD Model 
default international benchmark price 
includes adjustments for economic and 
purchasing power differences, further 
adjustment for some potential remaining 
differences by applying a minimal 
adjustment could be warranted. 
Therefore, we propose a 2 percent 
increase in the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark amount to 
account for potential differences 
between the U.S. market and markets in 
the reference countries that would not 
be addressed otherwise, meaning that 
the GUARD Model default international 
benchmark would represent 102 percent 
of the original value after adjustment. 
We believe a 2 percent adjustment is 
appropriate because the GUARD Model 
default international benchmark is 
already based on the lowest country- 
level average price among the set of 
reference countries. 
CMS also believes a 5 percent 
adjustment for the GUARD Model 
updated international benchmark 
accounts for potential differences 
between the U.S. market and markets in 
the set of reference countries for which 
international drug pricing information is 
available. Although the proposed 
calculation for the GUARD Model 
updated international benchmark price 
includes adjustments for economic and 
purchasing power differences, further 
adjustment for some potential remaining 
differences by applying a minimal 
adjustment could be warranted. In 
addition, such an adjustment, if it is 
greater than the adjustment for the 
GUARD Model default international 
benchmark could incentivize 
manufacturer submission of 
international net pricing data. 
Therefore, we propose a 5 percent 
increase in the GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark amount to 
account for potential differences 
between the U.S. market and markets in 
the reference countries that would not 
be addressed otherwise; this means that 
the GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark would 
represent 105 percent of the original 
value after adjustment. This would also 
maintain an incentive for manufacturers 
to submit the voluntary international 
net pricing data. 
We considered different adjustment 
factors however, we believe an 
adjustment factor of 2 percent for the 
GUARD Model default international 
benchmark and an adjustment factor of 
5 percent for the GUARD Model 
updated international benchmark is 
appropriate given the other types of 
adjustments across the reference 
countries (for example, GDP (PPP) 
adjustments). We welcome comments 
on our proposal for the applicable 
adjustment factor that may help advance 
the aims of the model test.

4. Alternatives Considered 
CMS considered an alternate process 
for identifying the set of international 
analogs from the selected data source of 
international drug pricing data. The 
process proposed in § 514.410(c)(3)(i) is 
to identify international products whose 
identifying characteristics align each 
GUARD Model drug both without any 
adjustments and with standard 
adjustments that do not change the 
drug’s characteristics and that have non- 
significant differences. For any GUARD 
Model drugs for which there is no 
international product aligned but there 
is at least one strength-misaligned 
international product, CMS proposes in 
§ 514.410(c)(3)(i), a process to consider 
drug pricing information for the 
strength-misaligned product(s) for the 
GUARD Model drug. An alternate 
process that CMS considered is to apply 
the process to consider drug pricing 
information for the strength-misaligned 
product(s) to all GUARD Model drugs, 
and not only to those that have no 
aligned international products. This 
would result in an increased number of 
international products contributing to 
the drug pricing information used to 
calculate the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark. 
CMS also considered changes to the 
identification process in relation to 
which strength-misaligned product(s) 
would be retained. One alternative 
possibility that CMS considered was for 
cases when there is more than one 
strength-misaligned international 
product for a reference country; for such 
a case, records for the two strength- 
misaligned international products 
closest in strength (in absolute terms) to 
the GUARD Model drug’s strength 
would be retained without any further 
considerations. This is different from 
the proposed process of comparing the 
relative strength difference and relative 
price difference to determine if one or 
two of the strength-misaligned 
international products closest in 
strength to the GUARD Model drug’s 
strength would be retained. 
Another possibility that CMS 
considered was for cases when there is 
more than one strength-misaligned 
product for a reference country and the 
relative difference is equal to or greater 
than half of the relative strength 
difference. In these cases, CMS has 
proposed to retain records for the 
strength-misaligned international 
product whose strength is closest in 
absolute terms to the GUARD Model 
drug’s strength. The alternative CMS 
considered was to retain the same 
strength-misaligned international 
product whose strength is closest in 
absolute terms to the GUARD Model 
drug’s strength but to modify its price 
by multiplying it by the ratio of 
strengths between the two strength- 
misaligned international products 
closest to the GUARD Model. CMS seeks 
comment on these alternative 
identification processes. 
CMS considered a range of 
alternatives for identifying the GUARD 
Model default and updated 
international benchmarks. Specifically, 
CMS considered using the lowest 
country level price for the GUARD 
Model updated international 
benchmark, however, we decided 
against this due to concerns about the 
sensitivity around net price data. We 
seek comments on the proposed 
approach, and in particular, whether we 
should consider using the lowest 
country-level average net price for the 
GUARD Model updated international 
benchmark. For the GUARD Model 
default international benchmark, CMS 
considered the possibility of adjusting 
annually for inflation. However, it is not 
clear how best to do that given the 
differences in reference countries that 
exist and because each drug may have 
a different reference country that is used 
to identify the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark; it is also not 
clear if inflation adjustment should be 
only relative to a U.S. price or if it 
should consider inflation in reference 
countries. Therefore, we are soliciting 
comments on this potential policy to 
inflation adjust the GUARD Model 
default international benchmark and the 
best ways to implement this. 
CMS also considered, for the 
calculation of the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark, not adjusting 
country-level average prices to account 
for economic differences among 
countries, such as GDP per capita, prior 
to the comparison of the available set of 
country-level average prices to identify 
the lowest country-level average price 
for a GUARD Model drug. We 
considered that perhaps there was not a 
need to GDP (PPP) adjust a single 
country-level average price for several 
reasons. First, the default GUARD 
Model default international benchmark 
represents an average within a country 
that would be expressed in U.S. dollars 
using the appropriate exchange rate for 
currency conversion. Second, while 
adjusting for GDP (using PPP) is 
valuable for selecting economically 
comparable countries, at the more 
granular level, it is limited in its ability 
to account for local differences in costs, 
taxes, tariffs, and competition.
170
Third, 
CMS considered that allowing the 
GUARD Model default international 
benchmark to remain unadjusted would 
create a benefit for manufacturers 
should they choose to submit net 
pricing information as discussed in 
Section IV.F. of this proposed rule. 
However, we decided against this 
because we believe that GDP (PPP) 
adjustment is the best practice when 
examining prices across countries. CMS 
welcomes comments on this alternative 
considered and other alternatives 
presented here, as well as our policy 
proposals. 
Another alternative for calculation of 
the GUARD Model default international 
benchmark considered was updating 
said benchmark each performance year 
if a subsequent performance year’s 
calculation resulted in a lower 
benchmark or if it changed at all. 
However, we decided against this to 
ensure that data availability did not 
result in some GUARD Model drug’s 
being updated and others not. 
We also considered a different 
approach to calculating the adjustment 
factor for the GUARD Model default and 
updated international benchmarks. In 
developing our proposal for the 
adjustment factor, we considered two 
options for structuring the adjustment: 
(1) applying a fixed adjustment (such as 
a percentage amount) for all GUARD 
Model drugs regardless of the 
benchmark method; or (2) applying a 
variable adjustment that reflects one or 
more characteristics of the GUARD 
Model drug, the alternative rebate 
calculations, or reference countries. 
Another alternative CMS considered 
was to delay enactment of the 
adjustment factor. This would mean that 
instead of applying the adjustment 
factor in performance year one, it would 
be applied during a subsequent 
performance year. We seek comment on 
whether the enactment of the 
adjustment factor should be 
implemented as proposed or delayed to 
a subsequent performance year. We also 
considered that no adjustment would be 
necessary. However, we opted to 
prioritize a straightforward approach 
that is intuitive and easy to implement. 
We seek feedback on whether an 
adjustment factor should be applied to 
the GUARD Model default and updated 
international benchmarks and the value 
of the adjustment factor, including any 
rationale for why it should be increased

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360386 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules 171
There are differences in timing between the 
GUARD Model’s performance year and the Part D 
Drug Inflation Rebate Program’s applicable period. 
Specifically, while the GUARD Model’s 
performance year would be implemented on a 
calendar year schedule, the Part D Drug Inflation 
Rebate Program’s applicable period is based on a 
fiscal year schedule. As a result, there would be 
Part D inflation rebate amounts from 2 fiscal years 
of the Part D Inflation Rebate Program that 
contribute to the GUARD Model’s single 
performance year report for a GUARD Model drug. 
To compare the per unit Part D inflation rebate 
amount to the per unit GUARD Model rebate, the 
Part D inflation rebate amount would be weighted 
to produce a per unit performance year Part D 
inflation rebate amount as described in this section 
of this proposed rule.

way. 
CMS welcomes feedback on all of the 
policies presented in this section of this 
proposed rule and the alternatives 
considered. 
H. Determination of the GUARD Model 
Rebate Payment Amount 
The GUARD Model would test an 
alternative calculation of the rebate 
amount described in subsection (b) of 
section 1860D–14B of the Act for the 
purpose of testing whether this reduces 
Medicare expenditures while preserving 
or enhancing quality of care; this 
alternative calculation would yield the 
‘‘GUARD Rebate Payment Amount.’’ 
Under the GUARD Model, we would 
waive the calculation described in 
subsection (b) of section 1860D–14B of 
the Act—replacing it with the GUARD 
Rebate Payment Amount—in 
circumstances where the per unit 
GUARD Model rebate, as described later 
in this Section of this proposed rule, 
exceeds the per unit Part D inflation 
rebate amount for a GUARD Model drug 
in a given GUARD Model performance 
year. 
In this Section of this proposed rule, 
we describe our proposal for the 
alternative calculation of the rebate 
amount described in section 1860D– 
14B(b) of the Act to yield the GUARD 
Rebate Payment amount, including the 
steps to calculate the performance year 
Medicare net price and the per unit 
GUARD Model rebate, as well as 
determining whether the per unit 
GUARD Model rebate exceeds the per 
unit Part D inflation rebate amount. To 
clearly identify the alternative rebate 
under the GUARD Model test, CMS 
would calculate the total GUARD Model 
rebate payment amount for which 
manufacturers would be accountable. 
To avoid potential duplication across 
activities under the Medicare Part D 
Drug Inflation Rebate Program, an 
incremental per unit GUARD Model 
rebate amount (calculated by comparing 
the per unit Part D inflation rebate 
amount to the per unit GUARD Model 
rebate) would be multiplied by the total 
GUARD billing units to calculate the 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount (as described later in this 
section of this proposed rule). This 
amount would be used to reconcile the 
amounts invoiced through the Medicare 
Part D Inflation Rebate Program against 
the total GUARD Model rebate payment 
amount.
171
This amount would be 
reflected in the follow-on steps for 
GUARD Model reporting, invoicing, and 
rebate payment as discussed in section 
IV.I. of this proposed rule. The Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount would be adjusted prior to these 
follow-on steps, when applicable, for 
GUARD Model drugs in shortage or 
when there is a severe supply chain 
disruption or likely shortage, as 
discussed in this Section of this 
proposed rule. We also include 
proposals for how we aim to account for 
the Manufacturer Discount Program. 
The alternative calculation tested 
under the GUARD Model that would be 
used to yield the GUARD Model Rebate 
Amount compares a Medicare net price 
(that excludes manufacturer direct and 
indirect remuneration (DIR) and 
discounts paid under the Manufacturer 
Discount Program) for each GUARD 
Model drug against the GUARD Model 
applicable international benchmark. 
Comparison against a Medicare net 
price that is exclusive of the 
manufacturer DIR and Manufacturer 
Discount Program discount amounts 
ensures that the GUARD Model 
applicable international benchmark is 
compared against a price that takes into 
account rebates and discounts provided 
by manufacturers. CMS proposes this 
approach so that manufacturers receive 
‘‘credit’’ for the rebates and discounts 
that they have provided to Part D plans 
or their PBMs and these amounts are 
subtracted in the calculation of the 
GUARD Model Rebate amount. 
1. Calculation of the Total GUARD 
Model Rebate Drug Amount 
At proposed § 514.510, CMS describes 
the calculation of the total GUARD 
Model rebate amount for a GUARD 
Model drug for a performance year. 
Specifically, CMS is proposing that the 
total GUARD Model rebate amount 
would be equal to the product of (1) the 
per unit GUARD Model Rebate amount 
for such GUARD Model drug for the 
performance year, and (2) the total 
number of units of the GUARD Model 
drug dispensed under Part D and 
covered by Part D plan sponsors for 
beneficiaries residing in the GUARD 
Model geographic areas during the 
performance year. 
2. Calculation of the per Unit GUARD 
Model Drug Rebate Amount 
To calculate the per unit GUARD 
Model rebate amount, CMS is proposing 
at § 514.510(b) that CMS would 
determine the amount by which the 
performance year Medicare net price for 
a GUARD Model drug exceeds the 
GUARD Model applicable international 
benchmark, illustrated in Figure B1. 
CMS proposes calculations for the 
performance year Medicare net price 
and comparison of these amounts to 
produce the per unit GUARD Model 
rebate amount.

CMS is proposing that the 
performance year Medicare net price for 
a GUARD Model drug would be a per 
unit net price for the GUARD Model 
Part D rebatable drug during the 
performance year, expressed in terms of 
NCPDP units. To generate the 
performance year Medicare net price, 
CMS proposes to first calculate a 
performance year aggregate gross price 
using WAC, then subtract manufacturer 
rebates derived from detailed DIR

Continued 
reported by Part D plan sponsors and 
discount amounts provided by 
manufacturers via the Manufacturer 
Discount Program to produce a 
performance year aggregate net price. 
Finally, CMS proposes to divide the 
performance year aggregate net price by 
the sum of the total quantity dispensed 
across all PDE records associated with 
the GUARD Model drug during the 
performance year to yield the 
performance year Medicare net price. 
These steps are illustrated in Figure B2 
and described in further detail. 
Figure B2: Calculation of Performance 
Year Medicare Net Price for a GUARD 
Model Drug 
CMS proposes at § 514.510(b) to use 
WAC as the starting point to calculate 
the performance year Medicare net price 
for the purpose of calculating the 
GUARD Model rebate amount. Section 
1847A(c)(6)(B) of the Act defines WAC 
as the manufacturer’s list price for the 
drug to wholesalers or direct purchasers 
in the United States as reported in 
wholesale price guides or other 
publications of drug pricing data. We 
believe that using WAC is appropriate 
for these reasons: (1) WAC is the 
manufacturer determined list price for 
the drug and the starting point for 
negotiations within the pharmaceutical 
drug supply chain market; (2) WAC 
does not include any discounts, rebates, 
or any other price concessions, which 
means it is an appropriate price from 
which to subtract manufacturer rebates, 
as identified in DIR, as well as discount 
amounts from the Manufacturer 
Discount Program, to calculate the 
performance year Medicare net price; 
and (3) WAC is publicly posted, which 
promotes transparency. 
We considered using the gross 
covered prescription drug costs 
(GCPDC) reported to Medicare in PDE in 
lieu of WAC; however, GCPDC is based 
on the plan and Part D enrollee 
payments and does not represent the 
manufacturer price for a given drug. 
GCPDC is a beneficiary—and claim- 
level—spending measure and not a 
manufacturer pricing measure. It 
captures the sum of payments by plans, 
beneficiaries, and Medicare at the 
negotiated point-of-sale price, and it has 
no relationship with the manufacturer’s 
list or invoice price. Manufacturer 
rebates are paid retrospectively, and 
they are not matched to individual 
GCPDC claims. Therefore, we do not 
believe it is an appropriate cost measure 
to use for this calculation. 
CMS also considered using the AMP 
as the starting point to calculate the 
Medicare net price. AMP is the average 
unit price paid to the manufacturer by 
wholesalers for drugs distributed to 
retail pharmacies, and it is used as the 
basis for the Part D inflation rebate 
calculation. AMP is calculated using 
sales transaction data and reflects cash 
discounts, volume discounts, and other 
reductions in the actual price paid, as 
specified in 42 CFR 447.504(b). CMS 
proposes not to use AMP as the starting point to calculate the Medicare net price 
for the purpose of the GUARD Model 
Rebate calculation for two main reasons. 
First, there may be some differences in 
the way that AMP is calculated across 
manufacturers. CMS allows 
manufacturers to make reasonable 
assumptions that are consistent with 
statutory requirements in calculating 
AMP. A survey by the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
Office of the Inspector General (OIG) 
found that manufacturers reported the 
need for more guidance related to 
accounting for bona fide service fees 
and rebates to PBMs in the calculation 
of AMP, and noted that there may be 
differences in how manufacturers are 
incorporating these components into 
their AMP calculations.
173
Second, 
there are differences in how AMP is 
calculated for inhalation, infusion, 
instilled, implanted, or injectable (5i) 
drugs, which have a high share of units 
reimbursed through non-retail 
pharmacies. These differences would 
complicate the calculation of the 
Medicare net price (and the GUARD 
Rebate amount) by creating 
discrepancies between 5i drugs and 
non-5i drugs. Specifically, 
manufacturers with 5i drugs are 
required to follow an alternative 
methodology for AMP calculation. If 70 
percent or more of the sales in units are 
to entities other than retail community 
pharmacies or wholesalers for drugs 
distributed to retail community 
pharmacies, then a manufacturer must 
use the 5i methodology for the monthly 
AMP calculation.
174
There is also the 
possibility, depending on sales, that the 
drug may be subject to the 5i AMP 
methodology in 1 calendar quarter, but 
not subject to that methodology in the 
next calendar quarter. One study 
examined differences in AMP, Medicaid 
rebates, and net Medicaid costs under 
the standard and 5i AMP methodologies 
and found that AMP was 42 percent 
lower on average because of the 
differences between the 5i methodology 
compared to the standard 
methodology.

policy-and-technical-changes-to-the-medicare- 
advantage-program (Accessed: 10 December 2025). For these reasons, although we 
believe that AMP is appropriate for the 
Part D inflation rebate calculation when 
examining year-over-year differences in 
manufacturer prices within the U.S., we 
do not believe AMP is appropriate for 
calculating the Medicare net price for 
purposes of the GUARD Model. 
Whereas the GUARD Model makes a 
point-in-time comparison of the 
Medicare net price to the GUARD Model 
applicable international benchmark, 
which is a single benchmark based on 
reference countries, the Part D inflation 
rebate calculation compares the same 
price measure over time within the U.S. 
CMS also considered using National 
Average Drug Acquisition Cost 
(NADAC), which represents the prices 
paid by pharmacies for prescription 
drugs. However, because this represents 
a pharmacy retail price, we do not 
believe it is appropriate to subtract the 
manufacturer DIR and Manufacturer 
Discount Program discount amounts 
from this price measure. CMS seeks 
feedback on our approach to calculate 
the Medicare net price for the purpose 
of calculating the GUARD Model Rebate 
amount, including any feedback on the 
proposed use of WAC in lieu of AMP, 
GCPDC, and NADAC to calculate the 
Medicare net price. 
(1) Performance Year Aggregate Gross 
Price 
As proposed at § 514.510(b)(1)(i), 
CMS is proposing to use WAC to 
calculate the performance year aggregate 
gross price. CMS is proposing to first 
identify all PDE records for all NDC–11s 
associated with the NDC–9 of the 
GUARD Model drug, and with dates of 
service during the performance year. 
Second, for each of the PDE records, 
CMS would identify a WAC based on 
the NDC–11 and multiply the quantity 
dispensed reported on the PDE record 
by the identified WAC value. Third, 
CMS would sum all the results of the 
second step across all PDE records to 
produce the performance year aggregate 
gross price. 
It is necessary to assign a WAC to all 
PDE records associated with the GUARD 
Model drug during the performance year 
because manufacturer rebates and 
Manufacturer Discount Program 
discount amounts will reflect all such 
PDE records. The identification of the 
WAC for each PDE record would 
involve two elements. For the first 
element, CMS would use third party 
sources to identify the WAC based on 
the NDC–11 for each PDE record with 
dates of service during the performance 
year. If the WAC is not available for that 
NDC–11, then CMS would use a WAC 
that is available for another NDC–11 
with the same associated NDC–9, having 
confirmed that the WAC is expressed in 
a per unit amount. 
The second element for the 
identification of the WAC for each PDE 
record, would involve CMS identifying 
the WAC in effect
176
on the date of 
service reported on the PDE record. If 
there was not an effective WAC as of the 
date of service for any PDE records 
during the performance year, CMS 
proposes to use the most recently 
effective WAC available. If the GUARD 
Model drug has some PDE records 
during the performance year for which 
there was an effective WAC as of the 
date of service, but other PDE records 
during the performance year for which 
there was not an effective WAC as of the 
date of service, CMS proposes to impute 
a WAC for the latter category of PDE 
records based on the available WAC that 
was in effect most recently before the 
date of service on the PDE record. If 
there was no WAC in effect before the 
date of service on the PDE record, but 
there was a WAC in effect after the date 
of service, CMS proposes that the WAC 
that was in effect after the date of 
service would be applied to that PDE 
record. 
If after considering both elements of 
the identification previously described 
there is no WAC available for any NDC– 
11 associated with the NDC–9 of the 
GUARD Model drug, CMS will not 
calculate a performance year aggregate 
gross price or issue a GUARD Model 
Rebate Report for that performance year. 
CMS considered whether we should 
use a different measure other than WAC 
if there is no WAC available, such as the 
AMP, NADAC, average wholesale price 
(AWP), GCPDC, or other appropriate 
measure. However, we believe that 
WAC is available for most drugs and 
therefore, another pricing measure is not 
necessary. We seek feedback on this 
approach and whether alternative 
measures such as AMP, NADAC, AWP, 
or GCPDC should be considered. 
(2) Performance Year Aggregate Net 
Price 
As proposed at § 514.510(b)(1)(ii), 
CMS would next calculate the 
performance year aggregate net price by 
subtracting manufacturer rebates 
derived from DIR reported by Part D 
sponsors and Manufacturer Discount 
Program discount amounts from the 
performance year aggregate gross price. 
First, for each Part D plan and each 
NDC–9 of a GUARD Model drug, CMS 
would sum the total manufacturer 
rebate amounts obtained from the 
detailed DIR report across all plans and 
associated NDC–11s for the GUARD 
Model drug for the performance year. 
CMS would then subtract this sum from 
the performance year aggregate gross 
price. CMS would not subtract other 
price concessions reflected in the DIR 
reports because manufacturers do not 
incur those amounts. 
Next, CMS would calculate the total 
Manufacturer Discount Program 
discount amounts that would also be 
subtracted out of the performance year 
aggregate gross price. As described in 
the Revised Medicare Part D 
Manufacturer Discount Program Final 
Guidance (Manufacturer Discount 
Program Final Guidance), the 
Manufacturer Discount Program was 
enacted into law in section 11201 of the 
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Public 
Law 117–169 (IRA) and codified in 
sections 1860D–14C and 1860D–43 of 
the Act.
177
Under the Manufacturer 
Discount Program, participating 
manufacturers are required to provide 
discounts on their applicable drugs 
(defined in section 1860D–14C(g)(2) of 
the Act and in section 130 of the 
Manufacturer Discount Program Final 
Guidance as proposed in the Medicare 
Program; Contract Year 2027 Policy and 
Technical Changes to the Medicare 
Advantage Program proposed rule (90 
FR 95148; November 28, 2025)

) 
when dispensed to Part D enrollees in 
the initial and catastrophic phases of the 
Part D benefit. As described in section 
50 of the Manufacturer Discount 
Program Final Guidance, discounts are 
equal to 10 percent of the negotiated 
price of the applicable drug when 
dispensed to an applicable beneficiary 
in the initial coverage phase of the Part 
D benefit, and 20 percent of the 
negotiated price of the applicable drug 
when dispensed to an applicable

the Part D benefit. As discussed in 
section 50.1 of the Manufacturer 
Discount Program Final Guidance, the 
IRA establishes lower percentages for 
discounts during a multi-year phase-in 
period for certain applicable drugs of 
specified manufacturers dispensed to 
applicable beneficiaries who are eligible 
for a low-income subsidy (LIS) under 
section 1860D–14(a) of the Act and for 
certain applicable drugs of specified 
small manufacturers when dispensed to 
any applicable beneficiary. CMS 
proposes to sum the Manufacturer 
Discount Program discount amounts 
paid by a manufacturer for a GUARD 
Model drug during the performance 
year, as well as the discounts that would 
have been paid by a manufacturer for a 
GUARD Model drug if not for the 
specified manufacturer and specified 
small manufacturer phase-ins, and 
subtract these amounts from the 
performance year aggregate gross price. 
The resulting amount (that is, the 
performance year aggregate gross price, 
net of manufacturer rebates and 
Manufacturer Discount Program 
discount amounts) would equal the 
performance year aggregate net price. 
The reason that CMS proposes to 
include the discount amounts that 
would have been paid by a 
manufacturer for a GUARD Model drug 
if not for the specified manufacturer and 
specified small manufacturer phase-ins 
in the total amount subtracted is to 
allow manufacturers to continue to 
experience the benefit of the phase-ins, 
as applicable, rather than transferring 
liability for the full discount amounts to 
the GUARD Model. 
(a) Calculating Manufacturer Discount 
Program Discount Amounts for Non- 
Phase-In Eligible Drugs 
CMS is proposing to derive 
Manufacturer Discount Program 
discount amounts from accepted final 
action, non-delete PDE records for the 
relevant performance year. For 
applicable drugs that do not have a 
specified manufacturer or specified 
small manufacturer phase-in applied, 
CMS would aggregate the Manufacturer 
Discount Program discount amounts for 
the performance year by NDC–9 by 
summing the amounts in the Reported 
Manufacturer Discount field on the PDE 
Inbound file layout.
179
The Reported 
Manufacturer Discount amount is 
reported by the Part D sponsor to 
convey the Manufacturer Discount 
Program discount amounts to CMS on 
the PDE. Therefore, summing amounts 
in this field on accepted final action, 
non-delete PDE records for each NDC– 
9 not subject to phase-in would provide 
reliable Manufacturer Discount Program 
discount amounts for these 
manufacturers. 
(b) Calculating Manufacturer Discount 
Program Discount Amounts for Phase-In 
Eligible Drugs 
For PDE records of applicable drugs 
that do have a phase-in applied, CMS is 
proposing at § 514.510(b)(ii) to calculate 
the discount as if the phase-in had not 
been applicable and then aggregate the 
Manufacturer Discount Program 
discount amounts for the performance 
year by NDC–9 as described previously 
for non-phase-in eligible drugs. 
CMS’ proposed three-phase 
methodology would preserve the 
statutory intent to delay imposition of 
full Manufacturer Discount Program 
discount amounts for specified 
manufacturers or specified small 
manufacturers. This three-phase 
methodology includes: (1) identifying 
the phase-in eligible PDEs records;(2) 
determining which of the associated 
PDE records were adjudicated during 
the Initial Coverage Phase or 
Catastrophic Phase; and (3) calculating 
the 10 percent or 20 percent discount 
based on the benefit phase identified to 
derive the Manufacturer Discount 
Program discount amount for each 
NDC–9. 
Specifically, CMS would identify 
accepted final action, non-delete PDE 
records where a phase-in discount was 
applied through use of two fields on the 
PDE Outbound File Layout: Applicable 
Discount Percentage for Specified Small 
Manufacturer Drugs and Applicable 
Discount Percentage for Specified 
Manufacturer Drugs Dispensed to LIS 
Beneficiaries.
180
 
For the identified PDE records, CMS 
would calculate the Manufacturer 
Discount Program amount that would be 
subtracted from the Performance Year 
Aggregate Net Price. First, CMS would 
determine the drug costs that fall into 
the Initial Coverage and Catastrophic 
Phases of the Part D benefit. If the True 
Out-of-Pocket (TrOOP) Accumulator 
field included on the PDE is less than 
the defined standard (DS) deductible, 
CMS would subtract the difference 
between the DS deductible and the 
TrOOP Accumulator from the Gross 
Drug Cost Below the Out-of-Pocket 
Threshold (GDCB) amount to find the 
drug cost that falls in the Initial 
Coverage Phase. If the TrOOP 
Accumulator is higher than or equal to 
the DS deductible, then the full GDCB 
amount represents the drug cost that 
falls in the Initial Coverage Phase. The 
Gross Drug Cost Above the Out-of- 
Pocket Amount (GDCA) represents the 
drug cost that falls in the Catastrophic 
Phase. Second, CMS would calculate a 
discount of 10 percent for drug costs 
that fall in the Initial Coverage Phase 
and a discount of 20 percent for drug 
costs that fall in the Catastrophic Phase. 
The sum of the calculated discounts for 
each NDC–9 for both phases would be 
subtracted from the Performance Year 
Aggregate Net Price. 
If a GUARD Model drug is not an 
applicable drug under the Manufacturer 
Discount Program, the methodology 
described previously to subtract 
Manufacturer Discount Program 
discount amounts from the Performance 
Year Aggregate Net Price would apply 
no differently. In other words, the 
Manufacturer Discount Program amount 
subtracted from the Performance Year 
Aggregate Net Price would equal zero. 
As discussed previously in section 
IV.B.2. of this proposed rule and 
proposed § 514.120(c)(1), CMS is 
proposing that generic drugs and 
biosimilar biological products would be 
excluded from the definition of GUARD 
Model drugs. If the proposal to exclude 
generic drugs and biosimilar biological 
products from the definition of a 
GUARD Model drug is finalized in a 
final rule establishing the GUARD 
Model, CMS believes that all remaining 
GUARD Model drugs would be 
applicable drugs. 
(c) Converting the Performance Year 
Aggregate Net Price to a Per Unit Price 
To generate the performance year 
Medicare net price, CMS is proposing at 
§ 514.510(b)(1)(iii) to convert the 
performance year aggregate net price for 
a GUARD Model drug into a per unit 
price by dividing the performance year 
aggregate net price by the total quantity 
dispensed of the GUARD Model drug 
during the performance year. First, CMS 
would sum the amounts reported in the 
quantity dispensed field across all PDE 
records identified at proposed 
§ 514.510(b)(1)(i) and described 
previously. CMS would then divide the 
performance year aggregate net price by

b. Comparing the Performance Year 
Medicare Net Price to the Applicable 
International Benchmark To Identify the 
Per Unit GUARD Model Rebate Amount 
To calculate the per unit GUARD 
Model rebate amount, CMS would 
compare the performance year Medicare 
net price to the applicable international 
benchmark. Specifically, CMS is 
proposing at § 514.510(b) that the per 
unit GUARD Model rebate amount 
would equal the difference between the 
performance year Medicare net price 
and the applicable international 
benchmark. As proposed at 
§ 514.510(b)(2), in cases where CMS 
determines that the applicable 
international benchmark price is not 
available for the GUARD Model drug, a 
per unit GUARD Model rebate amount 
for the performance year will not be 
assessed, and the total GUARD Model 
rebate amount would be invoiced as 
zero dollars in the GUARD Model 
Rebate Report. 
3. Determination of the Per Unit and 
Total Incremental GUARD Model Rebate 
Amounts 
As described in section IV.H.1. of this 
proposed rule, CMS is proposing that 
the total GUARD Model rebate amount 
would be equal to the product of: (1) the 
per unit GUARD Model rebate amount 
for such GUARD Model drug for the 
performance year; and (2) the total 
number of units of the GUARD Model 
drug dispensed under Part D and 
covered by Part D plan sponsors for 
GUARD Model beneficiaries in the 
GUARD Model geographic areas during 
the performance year. 
Under the circumstance in which 
CMS would waive the rebate amount 
described in section 1860D–14B(b) of 
the Act (that is, when the per unit 
GUARD Model rebate exceeds the 
performance year per unit Part D 
inflation rebate amount, as described in 
more detail later in this Section of this 
proposed rule) and instead apply the 
GUARD Model rebate amount, the 
GUARD Model rebate amount would be 
invoiced to the manufacturer in two 
stages. First, CMS would invoice the 
Part D inflation rebate amounts 
described in section 1860D–14B(b) of 
the Act through the Medicare Part D 
Inflation Rebate Program. Second, CMS 
would reconcile the amounts invoiced 
through the Medicare Part D Inflation 
Rebate Program against the GUARD 
Model rebate amount via an additional 
invoice that is specific to the GUARD 
Model. This invoicing process would 
occur three times, as described in 
greater detail later in this Section of this 
proposed rule: the GUARD Model 
Rebate Report, the GUARD Model First 
Reconciliation Rebate Report, and the 
GUARD Model Second Reconciliation 
Rebate Report. 
The amount that would be reflected in 
the GUARD Model-specific invoice, 
used to reconcile the amounts invoiced 
through the Medicare Part D Inflation 
Rebate Program against the GUARD 
Model rebate amount, would be the 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount. The Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount would be equal to 
the product of the incremental per unit 
GUARD rebate amount as described 
later in this Section of this proposed 
rule and proposed at § 514.510(c)(1) and 
the total units dispensed during the 
performance year for the GUARD Model 
drug to GUARD Model beneficiaries, as 
described later in this Section of this 
proposed rule and determined under 
proposed § 514.510(d). 
a. Calculation of the Incremental Per 
Unit GUARD Model Rebate Amount 
As proposed at § 514.510(c)(1) and 
illustrated in Figure B3, CMS would 
compare the per unit GUARD Model 
rebate amount determined at proposed 
§ 514.510(b) to the per unit Part D 
inflation rebate amount as defined at 42 
CFR 428.202(a). For line extensions as 
defined at proposed § 514.500, CMS 
would compare the per unit GUARD 
Model rebate amount to the greater of 
the per unit Part D rebate inflation 
amount determined under § 428.202(a) 
for such line extension drug or the 
alternative line extension per unit Part 
D inflation rebate amount, equal to the 
product of the amounts determined 
under § 428.204(c)(1) and (2). The 
GUARD Model would waive the rebate 
amount described in subsection (b) of 
section 1860D–14B of the Act when the 
per unit GUARD Model rebate exceeds 
the per unit Part D rebate inflation 
amount. 
Figure B3: Calculation of Incremental 
Guard Model Rebate Amount 
To make this comparison, CMS is 
proposing a few adjustments to the per 
unit Part D inflation rebate amount to 
account for differences in the GUARD 
Model and Part D inflation rebate 
reporting cycles and in the unit type 
used by each. While the per unit 
GUARD Model rebate amount is 
calculated on a calendar year basis, the 
per unit Part D inflation rebate amount 
is calculated on a fiscal year basis. As 
such, CMS is proposing at § 514.500 to 
calculate the performance year per unit 
Part D inflation rebate amount by 
computing the weighted sum of the per 
unit Part D inflation rebate amount for 
the first applicable period that overlaps 
with the first three quarters of the 
performance year and the per unit Part 
D inflation rebate amount for the second 
applicable period that overlaps with the 
last quarter of same performance year. 
CMS would weigh each per unit Part D 
inflation rebate amount according to the 
number of months of overlap between 
the respective applicable period and the 
performance year. If a GUARD Model 
drug is a Part D rebatable drug only 
during the months in which one of the 
applicable periods overlaps with the 
performance year, but not the months in 
which the other applicable period 
overlaps with the performance year, the 
performance year per unit Part D 
inflation rebate amount would equal the 
per unit Part D inflation rebate amount 
for the applicable period in which the 
drug was a Part D rebatable drug during 
the months that overlap with the 
performance year. 
Units reported on PDE are industry 
standard NCPDP defined values of each, 
milliliter and grams. In contrast, 
manufacturers can report the AMP unit 
for their drugs in the Medicaid Drug 
Programs systems with 10 different unit 
types (that is, each, capsule, tablet, 
suppository, transdermal patch, 
injectable antihemophilic factor, 
millicurie, microcurie, gram, and 
milliliter). Therefore, the per unit Part D 
inflation rebate amount is expressed in 
per-AMP unit terms and the per unit

NCPDP unit terms. 
Once these adjustments have been 
made, CMS proposes to calculate the 
incremental per unit GUARD Model 
rebate amount. If the per unit GUARD 
Model rebate amount is greater than the 
performance year per unit Part D 
inflation rebate amount, the incremental 
per unit GUARD Model rebate amount 
is equal to the difference. If the per unit 
GUARD Model rebate amount is less 
than or equal to the performance year 
per unit Part D inflation rebate amount, 
the incremental per unit GUARD Model 
rebate amount is zero and so CMS 
would not waive the rebate amount 
described in section 1860D–14B(b) of 
the Act. In instances where the 
performance year per unit Part D 
inflation rebate amount is equal to zero, 
the incremental per unit GUARD Model 
rebate amount will equal the per unit 
GUARD Model rebate amount. 
b. Calculation of the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model Rebate Amount 
As described previously, CMS is 
proposing that the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount would 
represent the amount to be paid by a 
manufacturer for a GUARD Model drug 
via the GUARD Model invoicing process 
for the performance year. To reconcile 
the amount already invoiced under the 
Medicare Part D Inflation Rebate 
Program against the total GUARD Model 
rebate amount, CMS is proposing at 
§ 514.510(c)(2) that the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount would be equal to the 
incremental per unit GUARD Model 
rebate amount described previously and 
determined under proposed 
§ 514.510(c)(1), multiplied by the total 
units dispensed during the performance 
year for the GUARD Part D rebatable 
model drug for GUARD Model 
beneficiaries, as described later in this 
Section of this proposed rule and 
determined under proposed 
§ 514.510(d). CMS is further proposing 
at § 514.510(c)(2) that the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount would be subject to adjustment 
based on any reductions in accordance 
with § 514.520 or any reconciliations in 
accordance with subpart G. 
4. Determination of the Total Units 
Dispensed 
CMS would determine the total units 
dispensed during the performance year 
for the GUARD Model drug, less any 
applicable exclusions. First, as proposed 
at § 514.510(d)(1), CMS would calculate 
the total number of units dispensed 
consistent with the methodology used 
in the Part D Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program and set forth at § 428.203. The 
total number of units would reflect units 
associated with the months of the 
performance year in which the GUARD 
Model drug meets the definition of a 
Part D rebatable drug (as defined at 
§ 428.20) as set forth at § 428.203(b)(1). 
CMS proposes to exclude units of each 
dosage form and strength of a GUARD 
Model drug for which the manufacturer 
provides a discount under the program 
under section 340B of the PHS Act, as 
described in section 1860D–14B(b)(1)(B) 
of the Act and set forth at 
§ 428.203(b)(2). CMS also proposes to 
exclude units associated with 
compounded drugs as set forth at 
§ 428.101(b)(1). To test an alternative 
calculation for the Part D inflation 
rebate calculation in the GUARD Model 
beneficiary population, CMS is also 
proposing at § 514.510(d)(2) to remove 
units for PDE records that are not 
associated with a GUARD Model 
beneficiary, as that term is defined at 
proposed § 514.5 and identified at 
proposed § 514.130(a). 
5. Reducing the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model Rebate Amount for 
Drugs in Shortage and/or When There is 
a Severe Supply Chain Disruption or 
Likely Shortage 
Under section 1860D–14B(b)(1)(C)(i) 
of the Act as codified in § 428.301, CMS 
will reduce the total Part D inflation 
rebate amount determined under 
§ 428.201(a), if any is owed, for a Part 
D rebatable drug that is currently in 
‘‘shortage’’, as set forth in § 428.300, at 
any point during the applicable period. 
CMS proposes at § 514.520(a) to reduce 
the Total Incremental GUARD Model 
rebate amount using a modification of 
the formula specified in § 428.301(b)(1). 
Specifically, to closely align with the 
Part D Drug Inflation Rebate Program, 
for each applicable period that overlaps 
with the performance year, we propose 
to use the applicable percent reduction 
and percentage of time the drug was 
currently in shortage during the 
applicable period, weighted according 
to the number of quarters of overlap 
between the applicable period and 
performance year. In proposed 
§ 514.520(a)(2), we propose that the 
reduced Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount would equal: 
For GUARD Model drugs that were 
Part D rebatable drugs during both 
applicable periods that overlap with the 
performance year, the sum of: 
€The Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate amount multiplied by 0.75 
multiplied by (1 minus (the applicable percent reduction determined under 
§ 428.301(b)(2) for the applicable period 
that overlaps with the first three 
quarters of the performance year 
multiplied by the percentage of time the 
GUARD Model drug was currently in 
shortage during the first three quarters 
of the performance year determined by 
CMS pursuant to § 428.301(b)(3))); and 
€The Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate amount multiplied by 0.25 
multiplied by (1 minus (the applicable percent reduction determined under 
§ 428.301(b)(2) for the applicable period 
that overlaps with the last quarter of the 
performance year multiplied by the 
percentage of time GUARD Model drug 
was currently in shortage during the last 
quarter of the performance year 
determined by CMS pursuant to 
§ 428.301(b)(3))).

€S3
= the percentage of time the GUARD 
Model drug was currently in shortage 
during that applicable period determined 
by CMS under § 428.301(b)(3). 
As an alternative to our proposed 
approach, we considered whether, for 
purposes of the GUARD Model, the 
applicable percent reduction should be 
greater than or less than the applicable 
percentage reduction specified in 
§ 428.301(b)(2). To maintain consistency 
with the Part D Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program and avoid creating different 
manufacturer incentives for addressing 
shortages and supply chain disruptions, 
CMS is proposing to apply, for purposes 
of the GUARD Model, the same 
applicable percentage reduction as used 
under the Part D Drug Inflation Rebate 
Program. 
Pursuant to section 1860D– 
14B(b)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act as codified in 
§ 428.302, CMS will reduce the total 
Part D inflation rebate amount 
determined under § 428.201(a), if any is 
owed, for a generic Part D rebatable drug 
or biosimilar biological product when 
CMS determines there is a severe supply 
chain disruption during the applicable 
period such as that caused by a natural 
disaster or other unique or unexpected 
event. As discussed in Section IV.B.2. of 
this proposed rule and proposed 
§ 514.120(c)(1), CMS is proposing that 
generic drugs and biosimilar biological 
products would be excluded from the 
definition of GUARD Model drugs. In 
the event that the proposal to exclude 
generic drugs and biosimilar biological 
products from the definition of a 
GUARD Model drug is not finalized in 
a final rule establishing the GUARD 
Model, CMS is proposing that for any 
GUARD Model drug that is a generic or 
biosimilar biological products as 
described at § 428.300, CMS would 
reduce the Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount, if any, when there 
is a severe supply chain disruption 
during the performance year in the same 
manner as specified in § 428.302, 
including the limitation on rebate 
reductions in § 428.302(b)(4). 
Accordingly, because a manufacturer 
already submits to CMS a rebate 
reduction request for a Part D rebatable 
drug pursuant to § 428.302(c), a 
manufacturer would not be required to 
submit to CMS a separate rebate 
reduction request for purposes of 
reducing the Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount. Specifically, CMS 
is proposing to codify in § 514.520(b) 
that, if CMS reduces the total Part D 
inflation rebate amount determined 
under § 428.302(a), if any is owed, for a 
generic Part D rebatable drug or 
biosimilar biological product that is a 
GUARD Model drug for an applicable 
period that overlaps with the 
performance year, CMS would reduce 
the Total Incremental GUARD Model 
rebate amount determined pursuant to 
§ 514.510(c)(2), if any is owed, using a 
weighted average of the same percentage 
reduction that CMS applied under 
§ 428.302 for each applicable period that 
overlaps with the performance year, 
weighted by the number of quarters of 
overlap between each applicable period 
and the performance year, as described 
in the first equation in this section of 
this proposed rule. For a GUARD Model 
drug that was a Part D rebatable drug 
during only one of the applicable 
periods that overlaps with the 
performance year, CMS would not use 
a weighted average and would instead 
simply reduce the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount by the 
same percentage reduction that CMS 
applied under § 428.302 for the 
applicable period that overlaps with the 
performance year and during which the 
GUARD Model drug was a Part D 
rebatable drug, as described in the 
second equation in this Section of this 
proposed rule. 
Under section 1860D–14B(b)(1)(C)(iii) 
of the Act as codified in § 428.303, CMS 
will reduce the total Part D inflation 
rebate amount determined under 
§ 428.201, if any is owed, for a generic 
Part D rebatable drug when CMS 
determines that the generic Part D 
rebatable drug is likely to be in shortage, 
as set forth in § 428.300. As noted 
previously, CMS is proposing that 
generic drugs would be excluded from 
the definition of GUARD Model drugs. 
In the event that the proposal to exclude 
generic drugs from the definition of a 
GUARD Model drug is not finalized in 
a final rule establishing the GUARD 
Model, CMS is proposing that for any 
GUARD Model drug that is a generic 
drug as described at § 428.300, CMS 
would reduce the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount, if any, 
when CMS determines that the generic 
GUARD Model drug is likely be in 
shortage in the same manner as 
specified in § 428.303, including the 
limitation on rebate reductions in 
§ 428.303(b)(4). Accordingly, because a 
manufacturer already submits to CMS a 
rebate reduction request for a Part D 
rebatable drug pursuant to § 428.303(c), 
a manufacturer would not be required to 
submit to CMS a separate rebate 
reduction request for purposes of 
reducing the Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount. Specifically, CMS 
is proposing to codify in § 514.520(c) 
that, if CMS reduces the total Part D 
inflation rebate amount determined 
under § 428.201(a), if any is owed, for a 
generic Part D rebatable drug that is a 
GUARD Model drug for an applicable 
period that overlaps with the 
performance year, CMS would reduce 
the Total Incremental GUARD Model 
rebate amount determined pursuant to 
§ 514.510(c)(2), if any is owed, using a 
weighted average of the same percentage 
reduction that CMS applied under 
§ 428.303 for each applicable period that 
overlaps with the performance year, 
weighted by the number of quarters of 
overlap between each applicable period 
and the performance year, as described 
in the first equation in this Section of 
this proposed rule. For a GUARD Model 
drug that was a Part D rebatable drug 
during only one of the applicable 
periods that overlaps with the 
performance year, CMS would not use 
a weighted average and would instead 
simply reduce the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount by the 
same percentage reduction that CMS 
applied under § 428.303 for the 
applicable period that overlaps with the 
performance year and during which the 
GUARD Model drug was a Part D 
rebatable drug, as described in the 
second equation in this Section of this 
proposed rule. 
CMS seeks comment on the proposal 
for reduction of the GUARD Model 
rebate amount for GUARD Model drugs 
in shortage, when there is a severe 
supply chain disruption, or that are 
likely to be in shortage. 
6. Alternatives Considered 
As explained in section IV.H.2.b. of 
this proposed rule, CMS is proposing at 
§ 514.510(b)(1) to calculate the 
performance year Medicare net price for 
a GUARD Model drug by subtracting 
manufacturer rebates and Manufacturer 
Discount Program discount amounts 
from a performance year aggregate gross 
price and converting the result to a per 
unit price by dividing by the total 
quantity dispensed of the GUARD 
Model drug. CMS is proposing at 
§ 514.510(b)(1)(i) to use WAC to 
calculate the performance year aggregate 
gross price but considered alternative 
data sources. Specifically, CMS 
considered using GCPDC, AMP, or 
NADAC to calculate the performance 
year aggregate gross price. We refer 
readers to section IV.H.2.b. of this

rationale for not using these 
alternatives. 
I. Reports of Rebate Amounts, 
Reconciliation, Suggestion of Error, and 
Payments 
In alignment with the Part D Inflation 
Rebate Program Rebate Report process 
described in 42 CFR 428.400 through 
428.405, CMS proposes at § 514.610 to 
send a GUARD Model Rebate Report to 
each manufacturer of a GUARD Model 
drug with the following information for 
each performance year: (1) the total 
GUARD Model rebate amount; (2) the 
per unit GUARD Model rebate amount; 
(3) the performance year per unit Part D 
inflation rebate amount; (4) the 
incremental per unit GUARD Model 
rebate amount as calculated in 
§ 514.510(c)(1) for each GUARD Model 
drug; (5) the total units dispensed 
during the performance year for the 
GUARD Model drug; and (6) the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount for each GUARD Model drug as 
calculated in § 514.510(c)(2). Because a 
portion of the total GUARD Model 
Rebate amount will already have been 
invoiced via the Rebate Report through 
the Medicare Part D Inflation Rebate 
Program, the Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount will be the 
amount invoiced through the GUARD 
Model Rebate Report. The manufacturer 
of a GUARD Model drug must pay the 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount for each GUARD Model drug no 
later than 30 calendar days after the 
receipt of the GUARD Model Rebate 
Report. 
Specifically, CMS proposes to send a 
Preliminary GUARD Model Rebate 
Report followed by a GUARD Model 
Rebate Report, as described in proposed 
§ 514.610(b), to all manufacturers of a 
GUARD Model drug, even if the amount 
due is $0; all GUARD Model rebate 
amounts would be subject to 
reconciliation as proposed in 
§ 514.610(d). CMS does not intend to 
send notice to manufacturers for drugs 
that are not considered GUARD Model 
drugs pursuant to proposed § 514.120. 
To address the completeness and 
accuracy of the GUARD Model rebate 
amount, CMS proposes to conduct 
regular reconciliations at 2 points in 
time to determine whether the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount must be adjusted due to 
updated claims and other reported data 
used in the calculation of such Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount (specified in proposed 
§ 514.510(c)(2): (1) within 12 months 
after the issuance of the GUARD Model 
Rebate Report; and (2) within 36 months 
after the issuance of the GUARD Model 
Rebate Report. The reporting process for 
each reconciliation would be the same 
process described for the original 
GUARD Model Rebate Report, with 
payment due for any outstanding rebate 
amount 30 calendar days after receipt of 
a reconciled GUARD Model Rebate 
Report with a reconciled Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount, as proposed in § 514.640(a)(1). 
In addition to regular reconciliations, 
CMS proposes a process to conduct 
reconciliations of the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount as needed 
to correct agency error and when CMS 
determines that the information used by 
CMS to calculate a GUARD Model 
rebate amount was inaccurate due to 
manufacturer misreporting. 
1. Definitions 
In proposed § 514.600, CMS proposes 
to define the following term applicable 
to subpart G (§ 514.600 through 
514.650): ‘‘Date of receipt’’ is the 
calendar day following the day on 
which a report of a Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount (as set 
forth in § 514.510(c)(2)) is made 
available to the manufacturer of a 
GUARD Model drug by CMS. 
For example, if CMS issues a GUARD 
Model Rebate Report through the 
method and process described in 
proposed § 514.630 on July 1, 2029, then 
July 2, 2029, will be the date of receipt 
and day 1 of the 30-calendar day 
payment period. 
2. Reports of Rebate Amounts and 
Suggestion of Error 
Consistent with the process specified 
in 42 CFR 428.401, 428.403, and 
428.405 involving preliminary and final 
reports for the Medicare Part D Inflation 
Rebate Program, CMS proposes to codify 
a multistep process to provide a 
manufacturer as defined in proposed 
§§ 514.610 and 514.620 with the 
GUARD Model rebate information 
described at proposed § 514.610(b)(2). 
CMS believes adopting the process 
described for the Medicare Part D 
Inflation Rebate Program will provide 
manufacturers participating in the 
GUARD Model with a familiar and 
consistent process for paying a GUARD 
Model rebate amount due, thereby 
minimizing the potential burden on 
participating manufacturers. Further, 
adopting the process described at 42 
CFR 428.401, 428.403, and 428.405 
provides CMS with sufficient 
operational time to acquire the relevant 
information specified in the proposed 
part 514; sufficient operational time to 
calculate the GUARD Model rebate 
amount and the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount specified 
in subparts F and G of the proposed part 
514; and sufficient operational time to 
ensure the accuracy of the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount through reconciliation. 
As discussed further in this section of 
this proposed rule and at proposed 
§ 514.610, CMS proposes to use an 
initial Preliminary GUARD Model 
Rebate Report (see proposed 
§ 514.610(b)) and a subsequent GUARD 
Model Rebate Report (see proposed 
§ 514.610(c)), with an opportunity for 
manufacturers to identify certain 
mathematical errors (see proposed 
§ 514.620) and two regular 
reconciliations of the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount to 
account for updates to claims and other 
reported data within 12 months and 36 
months after the GUARD Model Rebate 
Report is issued (see proposed 
§ 514.610(d)). 
a. Identifying the Manufacturer 
Responsible for Paying the GUARD 
Model Rebate 
As proposed in § 514.5, CMS proposes 
that, for the purposes of the GUARD 
Model, ‘‘manufacturer’’ will have the 
same meaning as defined for purposes 
of the Medicare Part D Inflation Rebate 
Program in section 1927(k)(5) of the Act 
and 42 CFR 428.20 thereby identifying 
the manufacturer that is responsible for 
paying a rebate using the same approach 
used for reporting AMP data. The reason 
for identifying the responsible 
manufacturer that is responsible for 
paying a rebate using the same approach 
as the Medicare Part D Inflation Rebate 
Program is to ensure that the 
manufacturer responsible for Part D 
inflation rebate amounts for a given Part 
D rebatable drug in geographies not 
included under the GUARD Model will 
be the same manufacturer responsible 
for GUARD Model rebate amounts in the 
geographies included under the GUARD 
Model. This approach would also 
ensure that the manufacturer 
responsible for a GUARD Model rebate 
amount is invoiced for the entire 
amount, since a portion of the amount 
will be invoiced under the Medicare 
Part D Inflation Rebate Program. 
3. GUARD Model Rebate Reports 
CMS proposes in proposed § 514.610 
that the multi-step reporting process for 
providing GUARD Model rebate 
information to a manufacturer would 
include: (1) an initial report, which 
CMS proposes to entitle the Preliminary 
GUARD Model Rebate Report in 
proposed § 514.610(b); and (2) a second 
report, which CMS proposes to entitle

proposed § 514.610(c). The GUARD 
Model Rebate Report would serve as the 
invoice for the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount due, if 
any, for each product determined to be 
a GUARD Model drug for the 
performance year, as specified in 
proposed § 514.610(c)(2). Manufacturers 
of GUARD Model drugs would receive 
a GUARD Model Rebate Report for their 
GUARD Model drugs even if the amount 
due is $0. CMS proposes at § 514.610(d) 
two regular reconciliations of the rebate 
amount to occur within 12 months and 
36 months after issuance of the GUARD 
Model Rebate Report specified in 
proposed § 514.610(c), which would 
include any restatements that have 
occurred in the drug pricing data and 
claims billing data reported to CMS and 
used in the GUARD Model rebate 
calculation specified in subpart F of this 
part. 
As the first step in the reporting 
process, as proposed in § 514.610(b) and 
consistent with the Part D Inflation 
Rebate Program, CMS would provide 
each manufacturer of a GUARD Model 
drug with the preliminary Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount through a Preliminary GUARD 
Model Rebate Report at least 1 month 
prior to the issuance of the GUARD 
Model Rebate Report specified in 
proposed § 514.610(c) for a performance 
year. 
By structuring the GUARD Model 
Rebate Report process to include a 
Preliminary GUARD Model Rebate 
Report, CMS is able to provide 
manufacturers with an opportunity to 
review the Preliminary GUARD Model 
Rebate Report before the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount is invoiced via the GUARD 
Model Rebate Report. CMS believes the 
Preliminary GUARD Model Rebate 
Report will facilitate manufacturer 
understanding of the GUARD Model 
Rebate Report and believes it would be 
beneficial for manufacturers to review 
the report for mathematical errors that 
could be corrected before invoicing via 
the GUARD Model Rebate Report. 
Further, a Preliminary GUARD Model 
Rebate Report would provide additional 
notice to manufacturers regarding 
whether they may owe a Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount. 
As the second step in the reporting 
process, CMS proposes in § 514.610(c) 
to provide the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount to the 
manufacturer through the GUARD 
Model Rebate Report not later than 22 
months after the end of each 
performance year. As proposed in 
§ 514.610(c)(1), the GUARD Model 
Rebate Report would include the same 
data elements as the Preliminary 
GUARD Model Rebate Report (specified 
in proposed § 514.610(b)(2)(i) through 
(xii)) and include any recalculations 
based on CMS acceptance of a 
manufacturer’s Suggestion of Error from 
proposed § 514.620, or any CMS- 
determined recalculations from 
proposed § 514.610(d)(2), if applicable. 
CMS proposes that manufacturers must 
pay the Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount within 30 
calendar days from the date of receipt of 
the GUARD Model Rebate Report as 
proposed in § 514.640(a)(1). We 
considered whether ‘‘day 1’’ of the 30- 
calendar day payment deadline should 
begin on the date of receipt of the 
GUARD Model Rebate Report, as 
defined at proposed § 514.600, or the 
calendar day following the date of 
receipt. We believe defining the date of 
receipt as day 1 of the 30-calendar day 
payment deadline is acceptable. We 
seek feedback on our proposed policies. 
For example, if the GUARD Model 
Rebate Report is provided on August 1, 
2029, then August 2, 2029, would be the 
date of receipt and therefore day 1 of the 
30-calendar day payment period; 
payment would be due no later than 
11:59 p.m. PT on August 31, 2029. 
a. GUARD Model Rebate Report 
Information 
To facilitate manufacturer 
understanding of the Preliminary 
GUARD Model Rebate Report, CMS is 
proposing in § 514.610(b)(2)(i) through 
(xii) that the Preliminary GUARD Model 
Rebate Report would include the 
following information: information 
related to the Part D inflation rebate 
amount for quarters corresponding to 
the relevant performance year; the 
NDC(s) for the GUARD Model drug as 
defined under proposed § 514.120(a); 
the total number of units covered under 
Part D for the GUARD Model drug for 
the performance year as determined 
under proposed § 514.510(d) (which 
would remove units acquired through 
the 340B Program, units for PDE records 
associated with beneficiaries outside of 
the Model geographic areas, units 
associated with compounded drugs, and 
units dispensed when the drug does not 
meet the criteria for a GUARD Model 
drug as outlined in proposed § 514.120); 
the GUARD Model applicable 
international benchmark as described in 
proposed § 514.410(a); the performance 
year Medicare net price as identified in 
proposed § 514.510(b)(1); the total 
GUARD Model rebate amount as 
determined in proposed § 514.510(a); 
the per unit GUARD Model rebate 
amount for the GUARD Model drug for 
the performance year as determined in 
proposed § 514.510(b); the performance 
year per unit Part D inflation rebate 
amount in proposed § 514.500; the 
incremental per unit GUARD Model 
rebate amount as determined under 
proposed § 514.510(c)(1); any applied 
reductions as described in proposed 
§ 514.520; the total Part D inflation 
rebate amount as described in 
§ 428.201(a); and the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount due as 
specified in proposed § 514.510(c)(2). 
When determining what information 
should be included on GUARD Model 
Rebate Reports, CMS considered which 
data elements are necessary to review 
the Preliminary GUARD Model Rebate 
Report for error, as described in this 
Section of this proposed rule, and how 
to ensure proprietary information is 
protected. The elements listed 
previously provide sufficient 
information for a manufacturer to 
review the Preliminary GUARD Model 
Rebate Report for mathematical error, 
while protecting proprietary 
information, and these elements are 
operationally feasible for CMS to 
provide within the proposed reporting 
timelines described in Table B8. CMS 
considered whether the GUARD Model 
applicable international benchmark 
should not be included in the GUARD 
Model Rebate Reports due to the 
possibility that its data source of origin 
is proprietary and there may be other 
possible limitations. CMS welcomes 
comments on this inclusion, and that of 
the other elements. 
b. Suggestion of Error 
In proposed § 514.620, CMS proposes 
a process in which a manufacturer may 
suggest to CMS that the manufacturer 
believes the Preliminary GUARD Model 
Rebate Report includes a mathematical 
error within 10 calendar days after the 
date of receipt of the Preliminary 
GUARD Model Rebate Report. For 
example, if the Preliminary GUARD 
Model Rebate Report is provided on 
June 1, 2029, then June 2, 2029, would 
be the date of receipt and also day 1 of 
the 10 calendar day period to submit a 
Suggestion of Error; the Suggestion of 
Error would be due at 11:59 p.m. PT on 
June 11, 2029, in this example. This 
suggestion of error period is in 
alignment with the same process for 
reports issued under the Part D Inflation 
Rebate Program as described in 
§ 428.403. As with the Part D Inflation 
Rebate Program, CMS believes a 10- 
calendar day period is sufficient when 
considering the volume of the data to be 
provided to manufacturers, the narrow 
scope of items that may be identified as

operational time necessary for CMS to 
provide a GUARD Model Rebate Report. 
As such, CMS proposes a Suggestion of 
Error period of 10 calendar days in 
§ 514.620(c). 
The Suggestion of Error process 
would be limited to mathematical steps 
involved in determining the total 
GUARD Model rebate amount and Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount as specified in proposed 
§ 514.510(c)(2). Additionally, in 
accordance with the restriction on 
administrative and judicial review as 
described in section 1860D–14B(f) of the 
Act, CMS is not providing an 
administrative dispute resolution 
process. CMS intends to consider all in- 
scope submissions under the Suggestion 
of Error process (for example, 
suggestions regarding a mathematical 
error) as described in proposed 
§ 514.620(a). CMS does not intend to 
review suggestions of error that are out- 
of-scope or submissions for a GUARD 
Model drug with a Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount due of $0. 
Table B8 summarizes the proposed 
GUARD Model Rebate Report 
milestones and deadlines. 
BILLING CODE 4120–01–P 
BILLING CODE 4120–01–C 
c. Timing 
As discussed previously and in 
proposed § 514.1(c), the GUARD Model 
would begin January 1, 2027, with a 5- 
year performance period and 5 
performance years aligning with 
calendar years 2027 through 2031, and 
7 payment years. To calculate the 
GUARD Model rebate as described in 
proposed § 514.510(c)(2), CMS will 
require WAC data, quarterly 
Manufacturer Discount Program data, 
DIR data, and data from the Medicare 
Part D Inflation Rebate Program. Table 
B9 illustrates when data for 
performance year 1 (calendar year 2027) 
will be available for each of these inputs 
to calculate the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate for the 
Preliminary GUARD Model Rebate 
Report.

This means, for example, that if a 
Performance Year ends December 31, 2027, the Preliminary GUARD Model Rebate Report could be issued up until 
August 31, 2029. 60396 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules As a result of the data lag described 
previously, the Preliminary GUARD 
Model Rebate Report for performance 
year 1 would be sent to manufacturers 
no later than August 2029 and would 
follow the process and cadence 
described at proposed § 514.610 and 
this section of this proposed rule. As 
described in proposed § 514.610(c), the 
GUARD Model Rebate Report cycle 
would occur annually thereafter until a 
Preliminary GUARD Model Rebate 
Report, GUARD Model Rebate Report, 
and the associated reconciled GUARD 
Model Rebate Report has been issued for 
every performance year of the 
performance period. As such, claims 
processing, data collection, invoicing, 
payment of GUARD Model rebates, and 
reconciliation would continue into CY 
2036. Table B10 summarizes this 
proposed timeline. CMS understands 
the reconciliation activities for some 
performance years extend beyond the 
end of the GUARD Model payment 
period but we believe the reconciliation 
activities pose minimal burden to 
manufacturers. Examples of 
reconciliation activities that could take 
place after the end of the GUARD Model 
payment period are responses to 
reconciliation reports, suggestion of 
errors, and payment of any reconciled 
rebate amounts due or owed. 
d. Payment Submission 
At proposed § 514.630 CMS describes 
a proposed standard method and 
process to issue GUARD Model Rebate 
Reports and accept manufacturer 
GUARD Model rebate payments using 
the online portal used for the same 
purpose in the Medicare Part D Inflation 
Rebate Program. This portal is called the 
Manufacturer Payment Portal (MPP). 
CMS has already onboarded many 
manufacturers to the secure, online 
portal that is facilitated by a CMS- 
contracted Third-Party Administrator 
(TPA) where reports and suggestions of 
calculation error for the Inflation Rebate 
Program are posted. CMS believes it will 
be less burdensome for manufacturers to 
use the existing secure, online portal 
rather than accessing a new portal for 
the purposes of receiving GUARD 
Model Rebate Reports, submitting 
suggestions of error, and making 
payments. CMS may consider the option 
of using a different data system for 
payment submission, including 
adapting a system that currently exists. 
If this rule is finalized, CMS intends 
to provide future technical instructions 
to manufacturers of GUARD Model 
drugs regarding how to access GUARD 
Model Rebate Reports and how to 
receive notifications alerting the 
manufacturer when such information is 
available. CMS also intends to issue 
reminder notices to manufacturers 
regarding the due date of payments. Per 
the definition of manufacturer in 
proposed § 514.5, CMS notes that the 
manufacturer that may access GUARD 
Model Rebate Reports and make 
applicable payments is the 
manufacturer responsible for paying a 
GUARD Model rebate, and, as stated 
previously, CMS proposes to identify 
the manufacturer that is responsible for 
paying a GUARD Model rebate using the 
same approach used for reporting AMP 
data. 
J. Reconciliation of a Rebate Amount 
CMS considered the need to establish 
a standardized method and process to 
determine appropriate adjustments to 
the Total Incremental GUARD Model 
rebate amount for a GUARD Model drug 
for each performance year to account for 
revisions to Manufacturer Discount 
Program, DIR, WAC, and Medicare Part 
D Inflation Rebate Program data as well 
as options for recalculation based on 
CMS identifying an agency error or 
manufacturer misreporting. As such, 
CMS is proposing policies for 
reconciliation, including with respect to 
enforcement of payment of any 
reconciled GUARD Model rebate 
amount, consistent with the statutory 
framework for the Part D Inflation 
Rebate Program and the express 
authority in sections 1102 and 1871 of 
the Act to adopt regulations for the 
proper administration of the Medicare 
Program. 
As proposed at § 514.610(d), CMS 
believes that it is necessary and

GUARD Model rebate amount for each 
performance year at regular intervals to 
include updated information about key 
data elements included in the 
calculation of the GUARD Model rebate 
amount. These data elements as set forth 
in proposed § 514.610(d)(1)(i)(A) 
through (H) include: total units as 
specified at § 514.510(d); the total 
GUARD Model rebate amount specified 
at § 514.510(a); the per unit GUARD 
Model rebate amount specified at 
§ 514.510(b); the incremental per unit 
GUARD Model rebate amount as 
calculated at § 514.510(c)(1); and the 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount as calculated at § 514.510(c)(2). 
Updating these calculation inputs at 
regular reconciliation intervals will 
result in a GUARD Model rebate amount 
that more fully reflects the majority of 
shifts in the underlying data following 
additional time for claims run-out, 
which refers to the maturation of PDE 
records in CMS’ internal PDE database. 
Because the information extracted 
represents the PDE records’ status in 
CMS’ internal PDE database at that 
moment in time, additional run-out may 
yield different information, either 
because more PDE records with 
dispensing dates during the applicable 
period were finalized and added to the 
database or because the status of the 
existing PDE records changed. CMS 
refers to ‘‘X months of runout’’ as the 
period between the end of the 
applicable period and the date when 
CMS accesses information about the 
PDE records; for example, ‘‘3 months of 
runout’’ means that PDE records are 
accessed for PDE records with 
dispensing dates during a performance 
year 3 months after the end of such 
performance year. Conducting a 
reconciliation of the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount with 
additional claims runout will improve 
the accuracy of the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount. 
Additionally, reconciliation of payment 
amounts is consistent with the approach 
to the calculation of the payment 
amounts in other CMS programs (such 
as the Manufacturer Discount Program) 
that provide for a reconciliation period. 
CMS notes that the reconciliation of 
the Total Incremental GUARD Model 
rebate amount, whether during a 
reconciliation proposed at 
§ 514.610(d)(1) or a discretionary 
reconciliation proposed at 
§ 514.610(d)(2) discussed further later in 
this Section of this proposed rule, will 
not create a separately payable and 
distinct Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount. Rather, 
reconciliation updates the prior Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount owed to CMS, if any, by a 
manufacturer of a GUARD Model drug 
so that the Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount ultimately 
accounts for shifts in the underlying 
data following additional time for 
claims runout after the GUARD Model 
Rebate Report is issued as well as 
subsequently identified data integrity 
issues, if applicable, to reflect a more 
precise calculation of the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount. This reconciliation approach 
aligns with the reconciliation process 
described in 42 CFR 428.401(d). 
Moreover, because the reconciled Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount is an adjustment of the prior 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount, CMS proposes at 
§ 514.610(d)(1)(i)(G) for a report of a 
reconciled Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount to also identify the 
difference between the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount due as specified on the GUARD 
Model Rebate Report set forth in 
proposed § 514.610(b)(2)(xii) and the 
reconciled Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount. CMS would only 
collect the net Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount due, if 
any, upon reconciliation to prevent any 
duplicate payments. CMS also proposes 
to refund any overpayment made by a 
manufacturer, as determined during 
reconciliation, as discussed in proposed 
§ 514.640(b). 
As CMS noted in the CY 2025 
Physician Fee Schedule (89 FR 97710) 
for the Inflation Rebate Program, CMS 
evaluated several options to reconcile 
the inflation rebate amount for Part D 
rebatable drugs to account for revised 
information. This informed the current 
proposal to establish two regular 
reconciliations at regular intervals to 
reconcile the Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount to account for 
revised information. As in the Part D 
Inflation Rebate Program, CMS 
considerations for the GUARD Model 
included the length of time needed to 
capture relevant changes to data inputs 
for recalculation and manufacturer 
burden. Specifically, CMS considered 
the average time span needed to ensure 
submission of the majority of Part D 
plan unit revisions specified in section 
1860D–14B(b)(6) of the Act and 
proposed § 514.510(d), and the average 
time span needed for the submission of 
data from Manufacturer Discount 
Program, DIR, and the Medicare Part D 
Inflation Rebate Program. CMS believes 
a longer period of claims runout (at least 
12 and 36 months of runout time under 
the proposed approach) would ensure 
that CMS more fully accounts for 
capturing of revised units. Further, the 
first reconciliation would include at 
least 13 months of claims runout for the 
performance year and would be issued 
within 12 months after the GUARD 
Model Rebate Report for the same 
performance year. The second 
reconciliation would include at least 37 
months of claims runout for the 
performance year and would be issued 
36 months after the GUARD Model 
Rebate Report for the same performance 
year. 
The first reconciliation, issued 12 
months after the GUARD Model Rebate 
Report, would provide sufficient time to 
capture the majority of updates to the 
data specified in proposed 
§ 514.610(d)(1)(i)(A) through (H). The 
second reconciliation, to be issued 36 
months after the GUARD Model Rebate 
Report, is sufficient to capture the 
remainder of the updates to the data 
specified in proposed 
§ 514.610(d)(1)(i)(A) through (H) while 
also closing out the calculation of the 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount for a performance year within a 
reasonable time period after the GUARD 
Model Rebate Report is issued (except 
for the circumstances in proposed 
§ 514.610(d)(2) regarding CMS’ 
identification of mathematical errors or 
manufacturer misreporting). 
Further, in considering whether 
consistency across CMS programs is 
critical, CMS believes that consideration 
for the completeness of data, as 
discussed previously, should be 
prioritized over consistency across 
program timelines. That is, when 
examining timelines from other CMS 
programs that collect data contributing 
to calculation of the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount, CMS 
prioritized completeness and accuracy 
of the data elements contributing to the 
calculation of the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount rather 
than prioritizing consistency among the 
data collection and reconciliation 
timelines themselves. To ensure an 
accurate Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount, CMS proposes to 
update additional calculation inputs as 
described in proposed 
§ 514.610(d)(1)(i)(A) through (H). CMS 
believes that a restatement of each data 
element included in proposed 
§ 514.610(d)(1) to reconcile the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount provided in the GUARD Model 
Rebate Report in proposed 
§ 514.610(c)(1) is appropriate to capture 
an updated Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount and is in line with

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360398 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules other CMS programs that provide for a 
reconciliation period. While some data 
points may not change, CMS would 
review the data to determine if there are 
any updates and use the updated data 
in the reconciliation to provide a 
reconciled Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount to the 
manufacturer. CMS notes that the 
applicable international benchmark will 
not be updated during reconciliation. 
Based on these considerations, similar 
to the multistep process for the GUARD 
Model Rebate Report proposed in 
§ 514.610(b) and (c), CMS proposes a 
multistep process to provide each 
manufacturer of a GUARD Model drug 
with a reconciled Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount on a 
regular basis. At both the 12-month 
reconciliation point and the 36-month 
reconciliation point, CMS proposes a 
reconciliation process that would 
include: (1) a preliminary reconciliation 
of the total GUARD Model rebate 
amount and Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount, which CMS 
would provide to manufacturers of 
GUARD Model drugs as proposed in 
§ 514.610(d)(1)(i); and (2) a reconciled 
total GUARD Model rebate amount and 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount, which CMS would provide to 
manufacturers of a GUARD Model drug 
as proposed in § 514.610(d)(1)(ii). CMS 
also proposes to apply the Suggestion of 
Error process specified in proposed 
§ 514.620 to each preliminary 
reconciliation. 
1. Regular Reconciliation 
First, as specified in proposed 
§ 514.610(d)(1) and similar to the 
Preliminary GUARD Model Rebate 
Report process proposed in § 514.610(b) 
and (c), for each reconciliation CMS 
proposes to provide the manufacturer 
with information about the preliminary 
reconciliation of the total GUARD 
Model rebate amount and Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount within 60 calendar days prior to 
the issuance of the reconciled total 
GUARD Model rebate amount and Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount (see proposed § 514.610(d)(1)(i)) 
to each manufacturer of a GUARD 
Model drug for a performance year. 
CMS proposes in § 514.610(d)(1)(i)(A) 
through (H) that the preliminary 
reconciliation would include, at a 
minimum, the same information 
outlined for the GUARD Model Rebate 
Report and the following updated 
information, if applicable: updated total 
number of units, including updates 
submitted by a PDP or MA–PD plan 
sponsor and updates to 340B units and 
units excluded as specified in proposed 
§ 514.510(d); the total GUARD Model 
rebate amount if any inputs are restated 
within the reconciliation run-out period 
as specified in proposed § 514.510(a); 
the per unit GUARD Model rebate 
amount if any inputs are restated within 
the reconciliation run-out period as 
specified in proposed § 514.510(b); the 
incremental per unit GUARD Model 
Rebate Amount as specified in proposed 
§ 514.510(c)(1), using the most recent 
per unit Part D inflation rebate amount 
for the performance year (if any inputs 
are restated within the reconciliation 
runout period); WAC for the 
performance year; the reconciled Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount as set forth in proposed 
§ 514.610(c)(2); and the difference 
between the Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount due as specified 
on the GUARD Model Rebate Report 
and the reconciled Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount as set 
forth in proposed § 514.610(d)(1)(i)(G). 
Second, CMS proposes in 
§ 514.610(d)(1)(ii) to provide a 
reconciled Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount to the 
manufacturer within 12 months and 36 
months after the GUARD Model Rebate 
Report was issued for each performance 
year. As proposed in 
§ 514.610(d)(1)(i)(A) through (H), the 
information in the report for a 
reconciled total GUARD Model rebate 
amount would include the same data 
elements as provided to the 
manufacturer of a GUARD Model drug 
in the report detailing a preliminary 
reconciliation of a total GUARD Model 
rebate amount and would include any 
recalculations based on CMS acceptance 
of a manufacturer’s Suggestion of Error 
from proposed § 514.620. A 
reconciliation of the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount may 
result in an increase, decrease, or no 
change to the total GUARD Model rebate 
amount or Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount, compared to the 
GUARD Model Rebate Report for a 
performance year or a previous 
reconciliation in the case of 
reconciliation conducted 36 months 
after issuance of the GUARD Model 
Rebate Report (see proposed 
§ 514.610(d)(3)). 
2. Suggestion of Error 
Similar to the Suggestion of Error 
process described in section IV.I.3. of 
this proposed rule, CMS proposes in 
§ 514.620(c) a process by which the 
manufacturer of a GUARD Model 
rebatable drug may submit a Suggestion 
of Error within 10 calendar days after 
the date of receipt of the information 
about the preliminary reconciliation of 
the total GUARD Model rebate amount. 
CMS proposes that a manufacturer may 
suggest to CMS that the manufacturer 
believes the difference between the 
preliminary reconciliation of the total 
GUARD Model rebate amount and Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount contains a mathematical error. 
CMS believes a 10-calendar day period 
is sufficient due to the same 
considerations of data volume, the 
narrow set of in-scope items for review, 
and the operational time necessary for 
CMS to publish the reconciled total 
GUARD Model rebate amount and Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount. 
3. Reconciliation Due to Error or 
Misreporting 
CMS considered options for 
establishing circumstances where a 
recalculation of the total GUARD Model 
rebate amount or Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount may be 
appropriate for a performance year after 
issuing the GUARD Model Rebate 
Report and/or a reconciled total GUARD 
Model rebate amount or Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount based on CMS identifying an 
error or CMS determining that the 
information used by CMS to calculate a 
total GUARD Model rebate amount or 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount was inaccurate due to false 
reporting or similar fault by the 
manufacturer. CMS also considered 
potential time limits for revisions and 
whether certain circumstances, such as 
instances of false reporting, should be 
exempt from such time limits. 
Based on these considerations, CMS 
believes that, to capture an accurate 
total GUARD Model rebate amount and 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount, and consistent with 
reconciliations of data submitted to 
CMS that provide for revisions when 
necessary due to errors, including 
mathematical errors, and manufacturer 
misreporting, certain circumstances 
merit reconciliation of the total, GUARD 
Model rebate amount and/or Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount separate from the 12-month and 
36-month reconciliations proposed at 
§ 514.610(d)(1). Specifically, CMS 
proposes in § 514.610(d)(2) that CMS 
may reconcile a total GUARD Model 
rebate amount and/or a Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount of an issued GUARD Model 
Rebate Report when CMS identifies 
either: 1) an agency error such as a 
mathematical error or an error in the 
information specified in a GUARD 
Model Rebate Report as described in 
proposed § 514.610(c) or report of a

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360399 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules reconciled GUARD Model rebate 
amount as described in proposed 
§ 514.610(d)(1), including reporting 
system or coding errors; or 2) CMS 
determines that information used to 
calculate the total GUARD Model rebate 
amount or Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount was inaccurate 
due to manufacturer misreporting. 
Examples of agency errors could include 
CMS incorrectly calculating the billing 
units per GUARD Model drug or the 
GUARD Model Rebate Report 
incorrectly displaying the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount. Examples of manufacturer 
misreporting could include instances in 
which the manufacturer has made a 
correction to previously submitted data 
as well as instances in which the 
reporting individual or entity reporting 
data or information to CMS on behalf of 
the manufacturer knows or should know 
is inaccurate or misleading (for 
example, inaccurate manufacturer 
pricing or product data under section 
1927(b)(3) of the Act), including 
information submitted by the 
manufacturer related to the 
international benchmark. This does not 
include standard restatements to WAC 
or other data outside of the standard 
process of issuing a reconciled Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount. In addition to manufacturer- 
initiated corrections, CMS may become 
aware of manufacturer misreporting 
based on fact finding and conclusions of 
enforcement authorities, for example, 
the HHS OIG, the CMS Center for 
Program Integrity, or the Department of 
Justice. In a situation where an error or 
manufacturer misreporting is identified 
prior to the 12- or 36-month 
reconciliation of the total GUARD 
Model rebate amount and Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount proposed in § 514.510(c)(1), 
CMS may choose to include a correction 
based on the circumstances proposed in 
§ 514.610(d)(2) concurrently with the 
12- or 36-month reconciliation. When 
CMS reconciles data due to an instance 
of agency error or manufacturer 
misreporting, CMS proposes that the 
agency would limit the scope of the 
reconciliation to the specific 
information that is the basis for the 
reconciliation and not update or 
otherwise revise any other data 
elements in the GUARD Model Rebate 
Report (specified in proposed 
§ 514.610(b)(2)(i) though (xii)) or the 
reconciled GUARD Model Rebate Report 
(specified in proposed 
§ 514.610(d)(1)(i)(A) though (H)) unless 
the correction directly impacts 
additional data fields. For example, 
updates to WAC effective dates may not 
change the performance year Medicare 
net price if the new effective WAC for 
a date of service matches the WAC that 
CMS had imputed for that date of 
service. 
In addition, because reconciling a 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount imposes substantial 
administrative burden on CMS to 
reprocess the total GUARD Model rebate 
amount and Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount, retest the 
reporting system, and reissue a 
reconciled GUARD Model Rebate 
Report, CMS proposes in § 514.610(d)(2) 
that it may exercise discretion not to 
initiate recalculation of the total 
GUARD Model rebate amount or Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount in these situations which are 
outside of the regular reconciliation 
process proposed in § 514.610(d)(1). 
4. Timeframe for Reconciliation Due to 
Agency Error 
CMS proposes that for a recalculation 
due to an agency error, the error must 
be identified within 5 years of the date 
of receipt of the GUARD Model Rebate 
Report for the performance year (see 
proposed § 514.610(d)(2)(i))). 
Identification means that CMS has 
knowledge of the error; CMS does not 
need to have completed its revision of 
the impacted data or determined if the 
revision impacts the total GUARD 
Model rebate amount or Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount within the 5-year period. CMS 
would timely complete these steps and 
determine, when reconciliation does 
impact the total GUARD Model rebate 
amount and/or Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount, whether 
the reconciliation could be included in 
an upcoming reconciled Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount for the performance year or if 
the reconciliation must be conducted 
outside of the regular reconciliation 
process described at proposed 
§ 514.610(d). CMS proposes 5 years to 
account for the additional time of the 
second reconciliation that would be 
conducted at 36-months as proposed in 
§ 514.610(d)(1). CMS believes that a 5- 
year period dating from the issuance of 
the GUARD Model Rebate Report allows 
for sufficient time to include 
restatements of underlying data while 
also placing a reasonable time limit on 
potential discretionary reconciliations, 
after which a manufacturer of a GUARD 
Model drug would not receive 
additional GUARD Model Rebate 
Report. 
5. Timeframe for Manufacturer 
Misreporting 
CMS proposes in § 514.610(d)(2)(ii) 
that for a circumstance in which a 
manufacturer misreports data, CMS may 
recalculate a rebate at any time if the 
information used by CMS to calculate 
the rebate amount was inaccurate due to 
manufacturer misreporting. For 
example, if a determination is made that 
a manufacturer misreported WAC, 
which affected the calculation of the 
model year Medicare net price, then 
CMS may recalculate the total GUARD 
Model rebate amount and the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount owed for a GUARD Model drug. 
CMS requests comments on the 
proposals related to manufacturer 
misreporting. 
6. Payment Deadline and Report 
Issuance 
CMS proposes in § 514.640(a)(1) that 
upon receipt of a reconciled Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount, manufacturers must pay that 
reconciled Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount within 30 
calendar days from the date of receipt of 
the reconciled Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount. A 30- 
calendar day payment deadline aligns 
with the payment period for the initial 
GUARD Model Rebate Report and for 
similar reconciliations in the Inflation 
Rebate Program described at 42 CFR 
428.405. 
As specified in proposed 
§ 514.630(a)(1), CMS would use the 
same method and process for issuing 
GUARD Model Rebate Reports and 
submission of payments for reports with 
a reconciled Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount. CMS would 
provide notice to manufacturers for 
reports with a reconciled Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount. CMS proposes in § 514.640(b) 
that if a refund is owed to a 
manufacturer based on a reconciled 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount, CMS would initiate the process 
to issue such refund within 60 calendar 
days from the date of receipt of the 
reconciled Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount. CMS will issue 
additional information on this method 
and process through future program 
communications. 
K. Enforcement of Manufacturer 
Payment of Rebate (§ 514.650) 
Consistent with the Medicare Part D 
Drug Inflation Rebate Program and 
enabled by CMS’ waiver of subsection 
(b) of section 1860D–14B of the Act, and 
as described in this Section of this 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  19:09 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00063 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\23DEP3.SGM 23DEP3

There are differences in timing between the 
GUARD Model performance year and the Part D 
Inflation Rebate Program. Specifically, while the 
GUARD Model would be implemented on a 
calendar year schedule, the Part D Inflation Rebate 
Program is based on a fiscal year (FY) schedule. As 
a result, there would be inflation rebate amounts 
from 2 FYs of the Part D Inflation Rebate Program 
that contribute to the GUARD Model’s single 
performance year report for a GUARD Model drug. 
The inflation rebate amounts would be weighted as 
described in section IV.H. of this proposed rule. 
proposed rule, CMS proposes that 
manufacturers of a GUARD Model drug 
that have failed to timely pay the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount as described in proposed 
§ 514.510(c)(2) may be subject to a Civil 
Money Penalty (CMP). Given the 
importance of these rebates, CMS may 
impose available CMP authority under 
regulations at 42 CFR 428.500 of the 
Medicare Part D Inflation Rebate 
Program under section § 1860D–14B(e) 
of the Act to ensure timely compliance 
with payments. CMS proposes in 
§ 514.650 to impose a CMP equal to 125 
percent of the rebate amount described 
at § 514.510(c) for each GUARD Model 
drug for each performance year that a 
manufacturer fails to pay the rebate 
amount for each dosage form and 
strength for each GUARD Model drug. 
Consistent with the Medicare Part D 
Inflation Rebate Program at Section 
1860D–14B(e), and the implementing 
regulations at 42 CFR 428.500, the 
proposed § 514.650 would implement 
the already established procedures for 
imposing and collecting a CMP. The 
total GUARD rebate payment amount, 
which would replace the rebate amount 
described at section 1860D–14B(b) of 
the Act, would be invoiced in two 
separate parts: the rebate amount in the 
Medicare Part D Inflation Rebate 
Program’s Rebate Reports plus the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount in the GUARD Model Rebate 
Report for a GUARD Model drug.
181
 
Because CMS would have already 
imposed any potential CMP on the 
rebate amounts in the Medicare Part D 
Inflation Rebate Program’s Rebate 
Reports, the GUARD Model would 
calculate any additional CMP owed as 
an amount equal to 125 percent of the 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount due or a reconciled Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount due for the GUARD Model drug 
in the relevant performance year. 
Additionally, CMS proposes to rely 
on our general CMP authority in section 
1128A of the Act, also referenced in 
section 1860D–14B(e) of the Act, and 
the implementing regulations at 42 CFR 
428.500. Specifically, section 
1128A(a)(8) of the Act allows a CMP to 
be imposed against anyone who 
‘‘knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be 
made or used, a false record or 
statement material to a false or 
fraudulent claim for payment for items 
or services furnished under a Federal 
health care program.’’ CMS believes that 
any GUARD Model manufacturer that 
knowingly fails to comply with the 
GUARD Model requirements as set forth 
in this regulation, could be subject to a 
CMP under section 1128A of the Act. 
Any CMP imposed against a GUARD 
Model manufacturer would be an 
amount equal to 125 percent of the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount due for the drug and applicable 
calendar year in addition to the 
Medicare Part D Inflation rebate amount 
that is due. 
CMS is proposing it may impose a 
CMP when a manufacturer fails to pay 
the GUARD Model rebate amount in full 
for a GUARD Model drug by the 
payment deadlines in proposed 
§ 514.640(a)(1). This means a 
manufacturer may be subject to a CMP 
if the manufacturer fails to pay the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount as invoiced in the GUARD 
Model Rebate Report or any reconciled 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount that is greater than the amount 
invoiced in the GUARD Model Rebate 
Report. More specifically, a 
manufacturer could be subject to a CMP 
when a manufacturer fails to pay a Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount due by any payment deadline 
proposed in § 514.640(a)(1) for: (1) a 
GUARD Model Rebate Report specified 
in proposed § 514.610(c); or (2) a 
reconciled Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount greater than the 
amount reflected in the GUARD Model 
Rebate Report specified in proposed 
§ 514.610(d). As discussed earlier in 
section IV.J. of this proposed rule, CMS 
notes that the reconciled or corrected 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount is not a separately payable and 
distinct rebate amount. Rather, the 
reconciled Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount is an update to the 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount owed to CMS by a manufacturer 
of a GUARD Model drug. 
CMPs are due at the applicable 
GUARD Model Rebate payment 
deadline, which occurs 30 calendar 
days after the date of receipt of a 
GUARD Model Rebate Report or a report 
of a reconciled Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount. CMS 
proposes to establish the same 
methodology as in 42 CFR 428.500 for 
determining the amount of the CMP as 
equal to 125 percent of the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount for such drug for a performance 
year. This penalty would be due in 
addition to the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount due. That 
is, a manufacturer would be responsible 
for paying the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount due in 
addition to any CMP imposed because 
of late payment. CMS is proposing this 
approach to apply CMPs based on a 
violation of section 1860D–14B(a)(2) of 
the Act, and its regulatory enforcement 
mechanism at 42 CFR 428.500, which 
this model is adopting and cross- 
referencing, as described in § 514.650 
for each GUARD Model drug. CMS 
believes that the ability to impose a 
CMP is necessary to ensure compliance 
with the GUARD Model in all 
circumstances where a manufacturer 
fails to make a rebate payment that is 
due for a Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount to CMS. 
The CMP would be calculated based 
on the outstanding Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount due at the 
payment deadline, which is defined in 
proposed § 514.640(a)(1) as 30 calendar 
days after the date of receipt of a 
GUARD Model Rebate Report or a report 
of a reconciled Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount 
containing any Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount due. Once 
a GUARD Model CMP is imposed due 
to a late payment, the penalty would 
remain in effect through any appeal 
procedures even if the manufacturer 
pays the outstanding Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount after the 
penalty is imposed due to a missed 
payment deadline. Any CMP would be 
assessed before the next 12- or 36-month 
reconciliation. 
As described at § 428.500, CMPs for 
the Medicare Part D Drug Inflation 
Rebate Program may be calculated at 
several points in time associated with 
missing a payment deadline for the 
rebate amount owed by the 
manufacturer. Accordingly, CMS is 
proposing that a CMP may be imposed 
after missing a payment deadline 
associated with any Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount if the 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount is reconciled to be greater than 
the amount invoiced in the GUARD 
Model Rebate Report. As these separate 
events can result in distinct and 
separate impositions of CMPs, this 
means that CMS would not modify a 
CMP from a prior missed payment 
deadline based on changes to the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount due following reconciliation, 
including scenarios where the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount is reduced following 
reconciliation. However, in the event

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360401 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules that the Total Incremental GUARD 
Model rebate amount due on a GUARD 
Model Rebate Report was not paid and 
a CMP was issued for violation of the 
payment deadline, CMS would not issue 
a second CMP on a reconciled Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount if reconciliation decreased the 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount stated on the GUARD Model 
Rebate Report. CMS believes that 
enforcing this requirement after each 
payment deadline, regardless of what 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount a manufacturer may or may not 
owe at a future payment deadline, is 
necessary to maintain the integrity of 
the model and consistency of the 
implementation of the model. Further, 
CMS is proposing this approach to 
ensure an enforcement approach that is 
operationally feasible and applied 
consistently in all cases. 
Payment of any CMP by a GUARD 
Model manufacturer would be in 
addition to any GUARD Model rebate 
amount due for a GUARD Model drug. 
In addition, CMS is evaluating all 
available options to ensure 
manufacturers’ timely compliance with 
their Total Incremental GUARD Model 
rebate payment obligations, including, 
without limitation, potential recovery 
approaches and enforcement actions. 
For example, CMS may refer 
manufacturers to the Department of 
Justice, Department of the Treasury, 
and/or the HHS OIG for further review 
and investigation. 
As described at § 428.500(c), and also 
reflected in proposed § 514.650, if CMS 
makes a determination to impose a CMP 
on a manufacturer for violation of a 
payment deadline, CMS would send a 
written notice of the decision to impose 
a CMP that includes a description of the 
basis for the determination, the basis for 
the penalty, the amount of the penalty, 
the date the penalty is due, the 
manufacturer’s right to a hearing, and 
information about where to file the 
request for a hearing. To ensure a 
consistent approach to civil money 
penalties, CMS proposes using existing 
appeal procedures for CMPs in § 1128A 
as referenced in section 1860D–14B(e) 
of the Act, and in 42 CFR 423, subpart 
T for manufacturers appealing a CMP 
imposed under the GUARD Model, 
consistent with the approach taken for 
the Medicare Part D Drug Inflation 
Rebate Program. CMS has utilized this 
appeals process for many years for CMP 
determinations affecting MA 
organizations and Part D sponsors. CMS 
therefore proposes to use this well- 
established legal process for CMP 
appeals from manufacturers that do not 
make inflation rebate payments by the 
payment deadline. CMS also proposes 
that the scope of appeals is limited to: 
(1) CMS determinations relating to 
whether payment of the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount was made by the payment 
deadline; and (2) the calculation of the 
civil monetary penalty amount. 
Section 1860D–14B(e) of the Act 
states that the provisions of section 
1128A of the Act (except subsections (a) 
and (b)) apply to civil money penalties 
under this subpart to the same extent 
that they apply to a CMP or procedure 
section 1128A of the Act. In alignment 
with the procedures outlined in section 
1128A of the Act, CMS proposes that 
collection of the CMP would follow 
expiration of the timeframe for 
requesting an appeal, which is 60 
calendar days from the civil money 
penalty determination in cases where 
the manufacturer did not request an 
appeal. In cases where a manufacturer 
requests a hearing and the decision to 
impose the CMP is upheld, CMS would 
initiate collection of the CMP once the 
administrative decision is final, 
recognizing that the manufacturer still 
has appeal rights. 
CMS proposes in that in the event that 
a manufacturer declares bankruptcy, as 
described in Title 11 of the United 
States Code, and as a result of the 
bankruptcy, fails to pay either the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount owed or the total sum of CMP 
imposed, the government reserves the 
right to file a proof of claim with the 
bankruptcy court to recover the unpaid 
Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount and/or civil monetary penalties 
owed by the manufacturer. 
L. Quality and Monitoring Strategy 
In this section of the proposed rule, 
we describe the quality and monitoring 
strategy for the GUARD Model. The 
CMS Innovation Center is testing the 
GUARD Model to monitor and evaluate 
whether the alternative payment 
methodology proposed under the 
GUARD Model reduces Medicare 
spending while preserving or improving 
quality of care. The proposed quality 
measurement strategy is consistent with 
section 1115A(b)(4) of the Act, 
including the measurement of patient- 
level outcomes and patient-centeredness 
criteria. CMS proposes to implement 
robust monitoring and evaluation 
activities to identify any changes in 
quality. 
1. General 
The GUARD Model tests an 
alternative to the inflation rebate 
payment calculation to understand 
whether this leads to greater savings 
while preserving or enhancing quality of 
care. The GUARD Model does not 
introduce any new financial incentives 
tied to quality performance for 
manufacturers, plans, or any 
stakeholder in the prescription drug 
supply chain. However, the GUARD 
Model does introduce additional 
liabilities for manufacturers in the form 
of rebate payments if the Medicare net 
price is greater than the GUARD Model 
applicable international benchmark, as 
described in section IV.H. of this 
proposed rule. We do not expect these 
additional liabilities to reduce quality of 
care. It is possible that manufacturers 
respond to the GUARD Model by 
reducing their Medicare net price in an 
effort to reduce the GUARD Model 
rebate payments, or reduce their launch 
prices over time for new drugs likely to 
be included in the GUARD Model 
during the performance period. If 
manufacturers respond in these ways, it 
is possible there would be a series of 
changes throughout the pharmaceutical 
supply chain. For example, if 
manufacturers reduce the net price of a 
GUARD Model drug, that may result in 
reductions in coinsurance rates for 
GUARD Model drugs, which would 
improve affordability for Part D 
enrollees who take these medications. 
However, given that this is a test, we 
cannot say precisely how manufacturers 
will respond; therefore, it is necessary to 
monitor quality and evaluate certain 
quality measures to fully understand the 
impact of the Model. 
Consistent with the evaluation 
provisions of section 1115A(b)(4) of the 
Act, CMS proposes utilizing quality 
measures to monitor and evaluate 
whether quality of care improves or is 
maintained. This includes monitoring, 
and if appropriate, evaluating changes 
in patient level outcomes that may 
occur as a result of the proposed 
alternative inflation rebate payment 
approach that is being tested under the 
GUARD Model drugs. To determine 
whether quality is preserved or 
enhanced in the GUARD Model, at 
§ 514.720(a), CMS proposes to examine 
multiple domains of quality, including 
but not limited to utilization of care, 
out-of-pocket costs, access to GUARD 
Model drugs, changes in Part D plan 
premiums, and patient experience, as 
described later in this Section of this 
proposed rule. Monitoring activities 
would take place at least annually and 
as appropriate based on availability of 
the data discussed in this section. CMS 
is interested in public feedback on how 
to structure and monitor quality of care 
in the GUARD Model. 
To detect possible changes in quality 
of care that may be associated with the

(Accessed: 10 December 2025). 
GUARD Model, CMS proposes in 
§ 514.720(b), to examine a range of 
outcomes using existing data. For 
example, administrative claims data 
such as PDE data may be used to 
conduct historic comparisons of trends 
in GUARD Model drug utilization and 
program spending (for example, 
Medicare Part D total gross drug 
spending and total out-of-pocket 
spending for the GUARD Model drugs). 
The Part D Formulary File
182
could be 
used to examine prescribing patterns 
(including observing for any shift to 
compounded or other categories of 
drugs that are not included in the 
GUARD Model). We would also use 
existing claims-based or administrative 
data to examine changes in MA–PD plan 
and PDP monthly premiums, MA–PD 
plan and PDP enrollment, and other 
indicators of quality of care. We 
anticipate that monitoring activities may 
also include patient and/or provider 
survey data analytics and tracking 
patient complaints and appeals. 
Examining these and other measures 
will help CMS assess quality of care, 
which must be evaluated under section 
1115A(b)(4) of the Act. 
The proposed GUARD Model does not 
test the efficacy of pharmacy dispensed 
prescription drugs, but rather, it tests 
the impact of an alternative Part D 
inflation rebate calculation. Thus, CMS 
does not propose new monitoring of 
changes to drug-related adverse events. 
If, during the GUARD Model, the patient 
experience of care, quality measures, 
and claims-based monitoring strategies 
are found to be insufficient to 
adequately monitor and measure the 
quality of care that GUARD beneficiaries 
are receiving, CMS may specify 
additional measures to monitor quality. 
2. Quality Measures 
CMS proposes at § 514.720 to use a 
variety of data sources to monitor and 
evaluate the quality of care, including 
patient-level factors. For example, CMS 
may monitor or evaluate outcomes 
related to any of the following: 
€Changes in Part D prescribing patterns (for example drug substitution 
effects, use of certain drug formulations 
or therapeutic alternatives over others, 
high-risk medication prescribing). 
€Changes in enrollment of standalone PDPs or MA–PD plans that 
are beyond expected variation. 
€Changes in drug formularies and tiering of Part D drugs in regions. 
€Patient experience measures for prescription drugs (for example 
medication access, refills, 
communication with prescribers). 
€Medication adherence (for example proportion of days covered). 
€Changes in costs to Medicare beneficiaries (for example, monthly Part 
D premiums, coinsurance, copayments). 
€Changes in generic drug substitution rates. 
As proposed at § 514.720(b), CMS 
may also find it necessary to 
supplement these measures by 
surveying beneficiaries who receive Part 
D medications dispensed at a pharmacy 
to better understand their individual 
experiences. In such a scenario, CMS 
plans to utilize existing surveys such as 
the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare 
Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey 
or the MCBS, whenever possible. Any 
new surveys would limit stakeholder 
burden to a minimum and utilize 
validated survey items. 
CMS believes that examining these 
and other quality measures will allow 
us to promptly identify any unintended 
consequences and assess whether 
quality of care improves or is 
maintained under the GUARD Model. 
CMS seeks feedback on our approach to 
monitoring quality of care and what 
other data sources or measures we 
should consider. 
M. Beneficiary Protections and 
Compliance Related Activities 
CMS recognizes that stakeholders may 
have concerns about the potential 
changes that may occur as the GUARD 
Model is implemented. For example, 
stakeholders may have concerns over 
potential disruptions to Medicare Part D 
enrollees’ access to drugs covered under 
Medicare Part D, including those that 
are GUARD Model drugs, as a result of 
changing financial incentives under the 
GUARD Model. To alleviate these 
concerns, CMS has considered ways to 
protect beneficiary access to Medicare 
Part D drugs during the model 
performance period, which we describe 
later in this Section of this proposed 
rule, along with our approach for 
compliance, audits and record retention, 
and enforcement authority and remedial 
action. 
1. Beneficiary Protections 
CMS proposes to use the Complaints 
Tracking Module,
183
as described in 
§ 423.129(a), an existing reporting 
system maintained by CMS, to record 
and track complaints submitted to CMS 
from beneficiaries, and others. CMS 
would periodically, but no more than 
monthly, examine whether complaints 
submitted are related to the GUARD 
Model drugs. Analyses conducted of 
complaints submitted could notify CMS 
that a particular drug has become harder 
to source or obtain after the 
implementation of the GUARD Model. 
A reporting system such as this would 
allow CMS to gather information to 
inform potential follow-up 
investigations to determine if any drug 
access issues are occurring. Therefore, 
CMS proposes at § 514.710(b) to use the 
existing Complaints Tracking Module as 
described in § 423.129(a) to monitor for 
complaints related to the GUARD 
Model. 
Additionally, as proposed at 
§ 514.710(b)(2) and as stated, for all 
CMS Innovation Center models at 
§ 512.150(b), CMS proposes to address 
as appropriate, any information related 
to the GUARD Model drugs that is 
reported through the existing Medicare 
hotline phone number (1–800– 
MEDICARE), including but not limited 
to requesting additional information 
from the submitter and conducting 
additional analyses to determine 
whether the report requires further 
action from CMS or other governmental 
entities. In addition, the Medicare 
hotline phone number will also be 
posted on the GUARD Model website 
along with an email address that 
beneficiaries or other stakeholders can 
use to share concerns with CMS about 
the GUARD Model. 
To ensure full and continued 
compliance with existing beneficiary 
protections, CMS expects Part D plans 
to continue to fulfill all of the existing 
Part D requirements under 42 CFR part 
423, including: 
€Compliance with all enrollment and anti-discrimination requirements stated 
in subpart B of part 423, and in 
particular the following: 
++ Allowing enrollment of all eligible 
beneficiaries who choose to enroll 
regardless of their anticipated drug 
utilization or costs. 
++ Not restricting enrollees’ 
pharmacy choices or taking any actions 
that would discourage enrollment or 
discriminate against beneficiaries based 
on their health status, prescription drug 
needs, or other factors indicating higher 
expected costs. 
€Compliance with all benefits and beneficiary protections including access

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360403 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules to covered Part D drugs stated in 
Subpart C of Part 423 and in particular 
the following: 
++ Preserving enrollees’ fundamental 
access rights to Part D covered drugs, 
which would include GUARD Model 
drugs, from any pharmacy. 
++ Disclosure and transparency 
requirements, specifically, providing 
clear, accurate, and timely information 
about changes in enrollees’ drug 
coverage, cost sharing, or access to 
medications as well as changes to 
formularies or utilization management 
requirements. 
€Compliance with beneficiary coverage determinations and appeals 
processes stated in Subpart M of Part 
423, and, in particular, the right to 
request formulary exceptions, tiering 
exceptions, and prior authorization 
exceptions under existing Part D 
requirements and adhering to existing 
timeframes, processes, and standards for 
coverage determinations, 
redeterminations, reconsiderations, or 
Administrative Law Judge hearings. 
2. Monitoring and Compliance 
Activities 
The CMS Innovation Center has 
designed and tested numerous 
alternative payment models that each 
include specific payment, quality, and 
other policies. However, there are some 
general provisions that are very similar 
across models. The general provisions 
address various topics, including but 
not limited to monitoring and 
compliance, described at 42 CFR 
512.150, and the requirement of model 
participants to cooperate in model 
evaluation and monitoring described at 
42 CFR 512.130. We propose at 
§ 514.730 to apply these general 
provisions on monitoring and 
compliance, based on the similar 
requirements that have been previously 
finalized in existing model tests. 
In addition, as described in section 
IV.L. of this proposed rule and as 
allowed under proposed § 514.720(a), 
CMS intends to monitor for specific 
potential issues that could arise under 
the GUARD Model. Specifically, CMS 
intends to monitor for major changes in 
Part D enrollees’ access to GUARD 
Model drugs, cost sharing for Part D 
enrollees who are taking GUARD Model 
drugs, and other measures, as described 
in section IV.L. of this proposed rule, at 
least annually and as appropriate based 
on data availability. CMS would also 
monitor changing list prices in the 
United States and the Medicare net 
price as part of understanding how 
manufacturers respond to the GUARD 
Model. CMS may also consider 
examining any changes in drug 
innovation, research and development; 
changes in launch prices of drugs; and 
timing of drugs coming to market in the 
United States. CMS also proposes to 
collaborate with the FDA to review 
shortage lists and determine whether 
the number of drugs or length of time 
on the shortage list changes over time. 
Consistent with other CMS Innovation 
Center models, and as stated at 
§ 512.150(b) and (c), CMS, as described 
previously, would conduct monitoring, 
and compliance activities for the 
GUARD Model to ensure the integrity of 
the GUARD Model and that the model 
is implemented safely and 
appropriately. As part of the CMS 
Innovation Center’s assessment of the 
impact of new models such as the 
GUARD Model, we have a special 
interest in ensuring that model tests do 
not interfere with the integrity and 
sustainability of the Medicare program 
from a financial, policy, and 
beneficiary-rights perspective. 
For these reasons, as part of the 
models currently being tested by the 
CMS Innovation Center, CMS or its 
designee(s) monitors model participants 
to assess compliance with model terms 
and with other applicable program laws 
and policies as well as to ensure that 
model participants are not falsifying 
data, increasing program costs, or taking 
other actions that compromise the 
integrity of the model or are not in the 
best interests of the model, the Medicare 
program, or Medicare beneficiaries. As 
stated at § 512.150(b) for all CMS 
Innovation Center models, GUARD 
Model participants would also be 
monitored to determine the effects of 
the GUARD Model on GUARD 
beneficiaries, pharmacies and other 
dispensing entities, and on the Medicare 
program and to facilitate real time 
identification and response to any 
potential issues. 
Further, as proposed specifically for 
the GUARD Model at § 514.750(a) and 
as stated generally for all CMS 
Innovation Center models at § 512.160, 
a GUARD Model participant could be 
subject to the remedial actions as stated 
at § 512.160(b) if CMS determines that 
one of the violations stated at 
§ 512.160(a) exists. 
CMS also proposes at § 514.750(b), 
that a manufacturer of a GUARD Model 
drug is required to notify CMS within 
15 calendar days after becoming aware 
that the manufacturer of the GUARD 
Model drug is under investigation or has 
been sanctioned by the federal, state, or 
local government, or any licensing 
authority (including, without limitation, 
the imposition of program exclusion, 
debarment, civil monetary penalties, 
corrective action plans, and revocation 
of Medicare billing rights). 
3. Audits and Record Retention 
We propose to adopt the audit, access, 
and record retention requirements set 
forth in § 512.135(a) and (b) for the 
GUARD Model. As stated in proposed 
§ 514.740, which applies specifically to 
the GUARD Model, and as detailed in 
§ 512.135(a), which applies to all CMS 
Innovation Center models, the Federal 
Government, including CMS, HHS, the 
Comptroller General, and their 
designees, has the right to inspect, 
investigate, and evaluate any documents 
and other evidence regarding 
implementation of an Innovation Center 
model. As stated in § 512.135(b), 
manufacturers of GUARD Model drugs 
are required to maintain and provide to 
the Federal government access to any 
documents and other evidence 
regarding all items set forth in 
§ 512.135(b). 
4. Enforcement Authority and Remedial 
Action 
It is necessary for CMS to have the 
ability to impose remedial actions to 
address non-compliance with the 
requirements of the GUARD Model and 
to ensure that the GUARD Model does 
not interfere with the program integrity 
interests of the Medicare Program. As 
stated explicitly for all CMS Innovation 
Center models at § 512.150(e), nothing 
contained in subpart A of part 500 
including the newly proposed part 514, 
limits or restricts the authority of the 
HHS OIG or any other Federal 
Government authority to audit, evaluate, 
investigate, or inspect the manufacturer 
of a GUARD Model drug. 
Therefore, as proposed specifically for 
the GUARD Model at § 514.750(a), and 
as stated for all CMS Innovation Center 
Models at § 512.160, CMS may take the 
remedial actions stated at § 512.160(b) if 
CMS determines that one or more 
grounds for remedial action enumerated 
at § 512.160(a) exists. To assist CMS in 
its responsibility of oversight, at 
§ 514.750(b), we propose that CMS 
requires the GUARD participant to 
notify CMS within 15 calendar days 
after becoming aware that the GUARD 
participant is subject to investigation or 
sanction by the federal, state, or local 
government, or any licensing authority. 
N. Interaction and Coordination With 
Other Models and Programs 
CMS is committed to ensuring people 
with Medicare continue to have access 
to robust and affordable prescription 
drug benefits. Upon reviewing potential 
interactions with other models and 
programs, we have found some

and the existing programs and policies; 
however, we do not believe these 
interactions pose significant challenges, 
largely due to the intentional design of 
the GUARD Model. Namely, the GUARD 
Model has been designed to work with 
and in addition to all Part D benefit 
modifications pursuant to the IRA. Most 
of the IRA-related Part D provisions will 
have been implemented before the 
GUARD Model is implemented. Where 
there may be opportunities for 
interactions, CMS has designed the 
GUARD Model to avoid any serious 
complications for the GUARD Model 
test due to overlap or interactions with 
other models, or for the existing 
program or policies. 
1. Approach for Overlap With CMS 
Innovation Center Models 
Upon reviewing existing and ongoing 
CMS Innovation Center models, we 
have not identified any models that 
would have significant overlap or 
interaction with the GUARD Model at 
this time. We seek comments on any 
significant impacts on other models that 
the GUARD Model might have, as well 
as impacts on the GUARD Model by any 
other models. We anticipate model 
overlap may occur between the 
proposed GUARD Model and future 
CMS Innovation Center models or 
programs not yet implemented. If the 
proposed GUARD Model is finalized, 
CMS would take the GUARD Model into 
consideration in the development of 
future model designs to address 
potential impacts of overlap with the 
GUARD Model. 
In summary, we are not proposing to 
modify or adjust any CMS Innovation 
Center model or CMS program or 
initiative with respect to model overlap 
with the proposed GUARD Model as we 
have presently not identified any 
significant overlap. If, in the future, 
CMS determines a modification or 
adjustment to the GUARD Model or 
other CMS Innovation Center model or 
CMS program or initiative is necessary 
for purposes of testing the GUARD 
Model, CMS would pursue such 
modification or adjustment at such time 
through the appropriate mechanisms. 
For example, modifications or 
adjustments to the GUARD Model 
would be pursued through notice and 
comment rulemaking whereas it might 
be appropriate for modifications or 
adjustments to other CMS Innovation 
Center models or CMS programs and 
initiatives to be pursued through 
updates to model policies and 
participation agreements, or program 
participation criteria or requirements. 
2. Medicare Drug Price Negotiation 
Program 
The Medicare Drug Price Negotiation 
Program, codified in sections 1191 to 
1198 of the Act, gives the Secretary 
authority to negotiate a MFP for a 
specified number of certain high 
expenditure, single source drugs 
without generic or biosimilar 
competition with participating drug 
manufacturers.
184
In August 2023, CMS 
published the list of 10 drugs covered 
under Medicare Part D selected for the 
initial price applicability year and for 
which MFPs will go into effect on 
January 1, 2026. The second set of 15 
drugs was announced in January 2025 
and the MFP for these drugs is expected 
to go into effect in 2027.
185
The GUARD 
Model avoids significant interaction 
with the Medicare Drug Price 
Negotiation Program by excluding any 
Part D drug from being a GUARD Model 
drug when an MFP for that drug is in 
effect. 
3. Part D Premium Stabilization and Part 
D Premium Stabilization Demonstration 
As established by the IRA, codified at 
section 1860D–13(a)(8) of the Act, the 
premium stabilization provision caps 
the annual increase in the base 
beneficiary premium at 6 percent for 
each year from 2024 through 2029.
186
 
Further, the Part D Premium 
Stabilization Demonstration went into 
effect in 2025 to test an approach to 
stabilize the year-over-year changes in 
premiums for PDPs during the 
implementation of IRA’s Part D 
redesign.
187
 
We acknowledge that the GUARD 
Model may affect the Part D plan 
sponsor market. Therefore, we seek 
comments on any potential impacts on, 
or interactions with, the Part D plan 
market, particularly for standalone 
PDPs. CMS acknowledges that the 
recent IRA related changes to the Part D 
program, as discussed in section II. of 
this proposed rule, have placed pressure 
on the Part D plan market, which can be 
observed from the increase in Part D 
plan bids and premiums that would 
have occurred if the base beneficiary 
premium stabilization had not gone into 
effect. We seek comments on whether 
and to what extent there may be 
additional pressures placed on the Part 
D plan market due to the GUARD Model 
and potential solutions to avoid or 
mitigate such impacts. We also seek 
comments on any potential interactions 
with the market for MA–PD plans. 
4. 340B Drug Discount Program 
The Health Resources and Services 
Administration (HRSA) administers the 
340B Drug Pricing Program that allows 
certain hospitals and other health care 
providers (covered entities) to obtain 
discounted prices on covered outpatient 
drugs (as defined at section 1927(k)(2) of 
the Act) from drug manufacturers. 
HRSA calculates a 340B ceiling price for 
each covered outpatient drug, which 
represents the maximum price a 
manufacturer can charge a covered 
entity for the drug that is provided to an 
eligible patient. Several types of 
hospitals as well as clinics that receive 
certain federal grants from the HHS may 
enroll in the 340B program as covered 
entities.
188
To coordinate with the 340B 
program, GUARD Model drug units 
associated with claims for GUARD 
Model drugs under the 340B program 
would be removed as discussed in 
section IV.H. of this proposed rule. 
5. Part D Direct Subsidy and 
Reinsurance 
Under section 1860D–15 of the Act, 
Medicare provides direct subsidy 
payments to Part D plan sponsors to 
help cover the cost of providing 
prescription drug benefits. The direct 
subsidy calculation is based on the 
Medicare Part D National Average 
Monthly Bid Amount (NAMBA).
189
 
Additionally, Medicare’s reinsurance

program provides additional financial 
protection to Part D plan sponsors by 
covering a portion of drug costs for 
brand-name drugs and biological 
products for enrollees who reach the 
catastrophic coverage phase. CMS 
acknowledges the need for increased 
stability of the Part D benefit, which has 
recently been transformed pursuant to 
the IRA.
190
The GUARD rebate 
calculation methodology does not 
directly impact the Part D program 
direct subsidy nor how reinsurance 
payments are reconciled post-coverage 
year. CMS solicits feedback on any 
relevant considerations related to the 
Part D program direct subsidy and 
reinsurance. 
6. Part D Low-Income Subsidies (LIS) 
Under section 1860D–14 of the Act, 
the LIS provides premium and cost 
sharing subsidies for eligible Part D 
enrollees with income and resources 
below statutory thresholds. The subsidy 
structure reduces beneficiary liability 
for premiums, deductibles, and other 
cost sharing consistent with the 
requirements of the statute and 
regulations.
191
 
The GUARD Model is designed to 
coordinate with the LIS by maintaining 
all existing LIS eligibility criteria and 
benefit structures, which would allow 
beneficiaries to continue receiving 
appropriate cost sharing protections. 
Therefore, the GUARD Model rebate 
payments are structured to work 
alongside, not modify, existing LIS 
provisions. 
7. Request for Comments 
We seek comment on our proposed 
approach to address overlap between 
the proposed GUARD Model and other 
ongoing or future Innovation Center 
models and CMS programs, as described 
in this Section of this proposed rule. We 
also seek comment on the potential 
need for any specific modifications or 
adjustments to the proposed GUARD 
Model that would be necessary to 
support a robust model test of the model 
or other CMS Innovation Center models. 
We also seek feedback on potential 
impacts on the Part D market with 
respect to unintended changes to market 
competition, Part D plan benefit and 
network offerings, and Part D plan bids 
and premiums. We welcome suggestions 
for potential policy options that may 
help to address any potential 
challenges. We welcome comments on 
the potential ways the proposed GUARD 
Model may impact CMS programs and 
initiatives and the potential need for 
modifications or adjustments to the 
proposed GUARD Model that may be 
necessary to minimize model overlap 
impacts. 
O. Evaluation 
P. Limitations on Review 
CMS would conduct an evaluation of 
the proposed GUARD Model, as 
required under section 1115A(b)(4) of 
the Act and as proposed at § 514.720(a). 
The evaluation would analyze changes 
in Medicare spending and quality of 
care attributable to the GUARD Model. 
The evaluation would require, as 
needed, the collection of representative 
information from manufacturers of 
GUARD Model drugs, Part D plans 
(standalone PDPs and MA–PD plans), 
drug purchasers, providers, and 
beneficiaries. The collection and 
analysis of this data would inform how 
such a model might function were it to 
be integrated within the Medicare 
program. 
All CMS Innovation Center models, 
which would include the GUARD 
Model, are rigorously evaluated on their 
ability either to improve quality without 
increasing spending or reduce spending 
without reducing quality. In addition, 
we routinely evaluate data from CMS 
Innovation Center models for potential 
unintended consequences of the model 
that run counter to the stated objective 
of lowering costs without adversely 
affecting quality of care. The design and 
evaluation methods, the data collection 
methods, key evaluation research 
questions, the evaluation period and 
anticipated reports for the GUARD 
Model are outlined as follows. 
1. Evaluation Methods 
The evaluation methodology would 
deploy multiple, mixed-method 
strategies to identify the effect of the 
GUARD Model’s impact on the net cost 
to Medicare and the quality of care for 
beneficiaries. The evaluation’s primary 
outcome is net Medicare Part D drug 
and total spending, which would be 
estimated by assessing the change in net 
spending for beneficiaries residing in 
geographic areas subject to the model 
intervention compared to areas not 
subject to the model intervention. 
We would also conduct additional 
analyses that help isolate the effect of 
the GUARD Model on additional 
outcomes of interest through, for 
example, an interrupted time-series 
which would exploit the introduction of 
the GUARD Model to assess how trends 
in ‘‘pre’’ period were disrupted to 
identify the model’s effects; a threshold 
analysis that exploits the drug spending 
threshold to assess the model’s effect on 
key outcomes associated with those 
drugs that were just above the threshold 
for inclusion in the model compared to 
those just below the threshold for 
exclusion from the model; and the use 
of alternative comparison groups that 
are not part of the model, such as 
beneficiaries who are in EGWPs or 
therapeutic classes of drugs excluded 
from the GUARD Model. 
We are considering several 
populations of interest for the GUARD 
Model evaluation, such as Medicare 
beneficiaries who are likely to receive 
one of the GUARD Model drugs based 
on recent diagnoses and/or prior 
treatment or other patient populations. 
Population subgroup analyses would 
capture the model’s specific impact on 
beneficiaries affected by the changes 
due to the model. 
Medicare spending would be 
examined in terms of net Part D drug 
spending for GUARD Model drugs, net 
Part D drug spending for any Part D 
drugs, total Parts A and B spending, and 
potentially other spending measures for 
specific types of health care services (for 
example, inpatient hospital spending). 
Total Medicare spending to the extent 
available would be net of DIR. 
CMS believes the proposed model 
may have some downstream impacts 
and the evaluation would examine 
quality to ensure it is maintained or 
enhanced. The evaluation of any impact 
of the model on quality of care would 
examine patient experience, drug 
access, and health care utilization. 
Patient experience would be measured 
through patient experience surveys and 
measures of patient costs, inclusive of 
premiums and out-of-pocket costs. Drug 
access would be measured by 
prescribing patterns and claims-based 
drug utilization (for example, rates of 
any use and duration of use) of both Part 
D (both GUARD Model drugs and non- 
GUARD drugs) and Part B drugs 
(particularly, for Part B drugs that can 
substitute for GUARD rebatable drugs). 
We would also examine non-drug health 
care utilization that may change because 
of the GUARD Model to estimate any 
downstream impacts on access to care. 
Examples of health care utilization 
include hospitalizations, emergency 
department visits, and condition 
specific utilization related to a given 
subgroup of beneficiaries. The impact

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360406 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules estimates would reflect the collective 
effect of the GUARD Model’s changes to 
Medicare rebates for GUARD rebatable 
drugs. 
CMS also proposes assessing the 
model’s market impact by examining its 
effect on the broader Part D drug market 
and on Part D plans, including through 
assessing various stakeholders’ 
responses. We also recognize that it is 
important to evaluate if the model 
resulted in any unintended 
consequences. 
2. Data Collection Methods 
We are considering multiple sources 
of data to evaluate the effects of 
GUARD. We expect to base much of our 
analysis on secondary data sources such 
as Medicare enrollment and claims data. 
Beneficiary level claims data would be 
analyzed to estimate the GUARD 
Model’s impacts on Medicare 
expenditures (total and by type of drug 
and service). We would examine other 
sources of data that may include rebate 
or provider discount information and 
international pricing data. 
For Part D drugs, we would analyze 
data on drug utilization patterns, 
pricing, and expenditures. We would 
also consider CMS evaluation contractor 
administered site visits, interviews or 
surveys with appropriate samples of 
providers, plans, manufacturers, 
wholesale drug purchasers, and 
beneficiaries. These qualitative methods 
would provide information that would 
help us understand better the dynamics 
and interactions occurring among the 
stakeholders in the GUARD Model that 
cannot be estimated using the proposed 
secondary data sources. 
3. Key Evaluation Research Questions 
Our evaluation would assess the 
impact of the GUARD Model on 
reducing Medicare net drug spending 
and preserving or enhancing quality of 
care. This would include assessments of 
drug pricing dynamics, Medicare 
expenditures, and beneficiary access to 
medications. For example, we would 
explore how net savings, if any, were 
related to specific aspects of the 
payment test, such as how the 
alternative benchmarks were identified, 
as discussed in section IV.G. of this 
proposed rule, and other secondary 
analyses. Our key evaluation questions 
would include, but are not limited to, 
the following: 
€Medicare Payments. Did the model result in net savings to Medicare, and if 
so, how? 
€Market Impact. How did manufacturer behavior change in 
response to the model? Is there evidence 
of broader changes to the 
pharmaceutical market, such as changes 
in the supply of drugs? How did Part D 
plans (standalone PDPs or MA–PD 
plans) respond, including making 
changes to formulary placement or 
premiums? How did other stakeholders 
such as PBMs respond to the model? 
€Quality. What was the impact of the model on the patient’s quality of care, 
including patient experience? Did 
beneficiaries’ costs, including premiums 
and cost sharing or access to drugs 
change under the model, and if so, how? 
Were there changes in drug or other 
health service utilization patterns that 
can be attributed to the model? 
€Unintended Consequences. Did the GUARD Model result in unintended 
consequences? 
The GUARD Model evaluation will 
gather evidence to inform certification 
through a rigorous, evidence-based 
process to determine how this model 
would perform if expanded nationally 
across the Medicare program. The 
evaluation would provide evidence to 
demonstrate if the model achieved its 
goals during the test period. It would 
also assess if the results were 
generalizable at a national scale and 
financially and operationally 
sustainable. 
4. Evaluation Period and Anticipated 
Reports 
As proposed, the GUARD Model 
would have a 5-year model performance 
period beginning in January 2027. The 
evaluation period would encompass this 
entire model performance period, the 
payment test period, and a baseline 
period. The evaluation would continue 
until all reconciliation has been 
completed. Continued evaluation after 
the end of the performance period and 
the payment period is necessary to fully 
assess the impact of the GUARD Model 
on reducing Medicare expenditures and 
preserving or enhancing quality. We 
would evaluate the GUARD Model on a 
continuous basis and release public 
evaluation reports annually. 
We recognize that interim results are 
subject to changing policies and issues 
such as sample size and market 
fluctuations. Hence, while CMS intends 
to release periodic summaries to offer 
useful insight during the model test, a 
final analysis after the end of the model 
would be important for synthesizing 
and validating results. 
Section 1115A(d)(2) of the Act 
precludes administrative and judicial 
review of certain specified model 
decisions. These preclusions are 
applicable for the GUARD Model, and 
there is no administrative or judicial 
review under section 1869 or 1878 of 
the Act, or otherwise, of the specified 
model decisions. We are also proposing 
to adopt section 1860D–14B(f) of the Act 
which would preclude administrative 
and judicial review of specific data 
inputs or calculations related to the 
underlying GUARD Model Rebate 
Report and reconciliation; therefore, 
such data and calculations are not 
appealable through this process. 
Q. Program Waivers 
We believe it may be necessary and 
appropriate to waive only to the extent 
necessary, certain requirements of title 
XVIII of the Act for the testing of the 
GUARD Model. We propose to issue 
these waivers using our waiver 
authority under section 1115A(d)(1) of 
the Act. The purpose of these waivers 
would be to allow Medicare to test the 
GUARD Model described in this Section 
of this proposed rule, with the goal of 
reducing Medicare expenditures while 
improving or maintaining the quality of 
beneficiaries’ care. Section 1115A(d)(1) 
of the Act provides authority for the 
Secretary to waive such requirements of 
title XVIII of the Act as may be 
necessary solely for the purposes of 
carrying out section 1115A of the Act 
with respect to testing models described 
in section 1115A(b) of the Act. This 
provision affords broad authority for the 
Secretary to waive statutory Medicare 
program requirements as necessary to 
carry out the provisions of section 
1115A of the Act. 
We welcome comments on other 
possible waivers under section 1115A of 
the Act of certain Medicare program 
rules beyond those specifically 
discussed in this proposed rule that 
might be necessary to test this model. 
We will consider the comments that are 
received during the public comment 
period and may make future proposals 
regarding program rule waivers during 
the course of the model test. 
1. Waiver of the Calculation of the 
Rebate Amount 
At § 514.800, we propose to waive 
program requirements that are necessary 
solely for the purposes of testing the 
GUARD Model. Specifically, we 
propose to waive the provisions in 
section 1860D–14B(b)(1) of the Act, 
which are the Medicare Part D inflation 
rebate calculation provisions, to 
implement the proposed alternative 
calculation for the rebate amount. 
We believe that section 1115A of the 
Act is broad and grants us significant 
flexibility in the design and 
implementation of new models. Further, 
in section 1115A(b)(2)(A) the Act 
provides the Secretary with broad 
authority to test innovative payment 
and service delivery models. We believe

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360407 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules this supports our proposed 
implementation of the GUARD Model 
test that incorporates drug pricing 
information from economically 
comparable countries to reduce 
Medicare Part D expenditures while 
preserving or enhancing quality of care. 
Further, the Secretary has the authority 
under section 1115A(d)(1) of the Act to 
waive certain Medicare and Medicaid 
statutory requirements ‘‘as may be 
necessary solely for purposes of carrying 
out this Section of this proposed rule 
with respect to testing models.’’ 
We believe this proposed waiver of 
the Part D inflation rebate calculation 
provisions in section 1860D–14B(b)(1) 
of the Act, is necessary to implement 
the proposed alternative calculation for 
the rebate amount as described in 
section IV.H. of this proposed rule. The 
GUARD Model would test an alternative 
calculation of the rebate amount 
described in section 1860D–14B(b) of 
the Act; this alternative calculation 
would yield the GUARD Rebate 
Payment Amount. The GUARD Model 
would waive the calculation described 
in section 1860D–14B(b)(1) of the Act— 
replacing it with the GUARD Rebate 
Payment Amount—in circumstances 
where the per unit GUARD Model 
rebate (described later in this section) 
exceeds the per unit Part D inflation 
rebate amount for a GUARD Model drug 
in a given GUARD Model performance 
year. As such, we believe the proposed 
waiver of the Medicare Part D inflation 
rebate calculation in section 1860D– 
14B(b)(1) of the Act as part of the 
GUARD Model test is necessary to 
implement the proposed alternative 
calculation for the rebate amount. 
We seek comment on our proposed 
waiver of section 1860D–14B(b)(1) of 
the Act. 
2. Waiver of Timing Requirements 
In proposed § 514.800, we propose to 
waive program requirements as 
necessary solely for the purposes of 
testing the GUARD Model. Specifically, 
we propose to waive section 1860D– 
14B(a)(1) of the Act and instead we 
propose the following deadlines, 
effective dates, and time period 
requirements for the GUARD Model. 
Section 1860D–14B(a)(1) of the Act 
describes the timing requirements for 
manufacturer rebate reports issued by 
CMS—this section specifies that CMS 
will issue these rebate reports within 
nine months of the applicable period; 
we are proposing to waive these timing 
requirements and establish new 
deadlines for the rebate reports in the 
GUARD Model. 
First, as described in section IV.I. of 
this proposed rule, we propose in 
§ 514.610(b)(1) that no later than 20 
months after the end of the first 
performance year, CMS would, for each 
GUARD Model Drug, issue the 
Preliminary GUARD Model Rebate 
Report to the GUARD manufacturers; 
the Preliminary GUARD Model Rebate 
Report would include the following for 
such performance year: per unit GUARD 
Model rebate amount, applicable 
GUARD Model billing units, and total 
GUARD Model Rebate Amount. We 
propose at § 514.610(c) that CMS would, 
for each GUARD Model Drug, issue the 
GUARD Model Rebate Report to the 
GUARD manufacturers no later than 22 
months after the end of each 
performance year. The GUARD Model 
Rebate Report, as is the case for all the 
other rebate reports, would include the 
following for such performance year: 
per unit GUARD Model rebate amount, 
applicable GUARD Model billing units, 
and total GUARD Model Rebate 
Amount. 
We also propose in § 514.610(d)(1) 
that no later than 12 months after the 
receipt of the GUARD Model Rebate 
Report, CMS would, for each GUARD 
Model Drug, issue the First 
Reconciliation of the Preliminary 
GUARD Model Rebate Report to the 
GUARD manufacturers. No later than 12 
months after the receipt of the GUARD 
Model Rebate Report, CMS would, for 
each GUARD Model Drug, issue the 
First Reconciliation of the GUARD 
Model Rebate Report to the GUARD 
manufacturers; the First Reconciliation 
of the GUARD Model Rebate Report 
would include the following for such 
performance year: per unit GUARD 
Model rebate amount, updated 
applicable GUARD Model billing units, 
and total GUARD Model Rebate 
Amount. Within 30 calendar days of 
receipt of the First Reconciliation of the 
GUARD Model Rebate Report, the 
Manufacturer Reconciled Rebate 
Amount would be due. 
We also propose in § 514.610(d)(1)(ii) 
that no later than 36 months after the 
receipt of the GUARD Model Rebate 
Report, CMS would, for each GUARD 
Model Drug, issue the Second 
Reconciliation of the Preliminary 
GUARD Model Rebate Report to the 
GUARD manufacturers. No later than 36 
months after the receipt of the GUARD 
Model Rebate Report, CMS would, for 
each GUARD Model Drug, issue the 
Second Reconciliation of the GUARD 
Model Rebate Report to the GUARD 
manufacturers. Within 30 calendar days 
of receipt of the Second Reconciliation 
of the GUARD Model Rebate Report, the 
Manufacturer Reconciled Rebate 
Amount would be due. 
As described in this section of this 
proposed rule, we believe these waivers 
are necessary to implement the GUARD 
Model on the timeline proposed herein 
given various operational considerations 
necessary to calculate GUARD Model 
Rebate Amounts. We believe that by 
issuing these rebate reports on the 
schedule outlined previously instead of 
the schedule specified in section 
1860D–14B(a)(1) of the Act, CMS would 
be able to both calculate the necessary 
information for comprehensive rebate 
reports as well as align with the need to 
provide timely information about 
Medicare Part D inflation rebates and 
GUARD Model Rebate Amounts to 
GUARD Manufacturers. As such, we 
propose waiving section 1860D– 
14B(a)(1) of the Act to the extent 
necessary to allow CMS to issue GUARD 
rebate reports on the schedule outlined 
previously. 
We seek comments on our proposed 
waiver of section 1860D–14B(a)(1) of the 
Act. 
R. Severability 
We propose at § 514.900 that should 
any provision of the proposed part 514 
be held invalid or unenforceable by its 
terms, or as applied to any person or 
circumstance, such provisions would be 
severable from the remainder of part 514 
and the invalidity or unenforceability 
would not affect the remainder of the 
provisions of part 514. For example, 
should the proposed alternate rebate 
calculation payment methodology in 
this proposed rule be deemed invalid or 
unenforceable, the underlying 
obligation under current statute will 
continue. 
We seek comment on our proposed 
severability policies. 
S. Model Terminations 
We propose at § 514.910(a) that the 
standard provisions for Innovation 
Center models relating to termination of 
an Innovation Center model by CMS as 
set forth at § 512.165 would apply to the 
GUARD Model. Consistent with these 
provisions, if we terminate the GUARD 
Model, we would provide, as required at 
§ 512.165(b), written notice to 
manufacturers of GUARD Model drugs 
specifying the grounds for termination 
and the effective date of such 
termination or ending. We propose to 
state at § 514.910(b), that consistent 
with section 1115A(d)(2) of the Act, 
termination of the GUARD Model is not 
subject to administrative or judicial 
review. 
We seek comments on our proposed 
model termination policies.

Requirements 
As stated in section 1115A(d)(3) of the 
Act, Chapter 35 of title 44, United States 
Code, shall not apply to the testing and 
evaluation of Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services (CMS) Innovation 
Center Models. As a result, the 
information collection requirements 
contained in this proposed rule need 
not be reviewed by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB). 
However, costs incurred through 
information collections are discussed in 
section IV. of this proposed rule. 
V. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
A. Statement of Need 
As explained in section II of this 
proposed rule, existing research finds 
that the prices of drugs sold in the 
United States are much higher than the 
prices of the same drugs sold in other 
countries. For brand-name originator 
drugs,
192
U.S. prices are approximately 
422 percent of prices in economically 
comparable countries. The disparity 
between U.S. drug prices and prices in 
other economically comparable 
countries may have several drivers, but 
a key component is the substantial 
difference in the way prescription drug 
prices are determined in the United 
States and other economically 
comparable countries. Although there is 
wide variation in the way drug prices 
are determined in economically 
comparable countries, in general, many 
countries take a more centralized 
approach to drug pricing and/or have 
greater involvement in determining 
prices for drugs than the United 
States.
193
 
High prescription drug prices in the 
United States influence Part D spending, 
which have also increased over time. As 
discussed in Section II of this proposed 
rule, total Part D gross drug spending 
increased from $121 billion in 2014 to 
$276 billion in 2023, an increase of over 
100 percent, as reported by the 
Medicare Payment Advisory 
Commission (MedPAC).
194
High drug 
costs limit access to care and treatment, 
which in turn, can have cascading 
consequences that lead to poor health 
for patients, increased medical 
spending, and potentially avoidable 
expenditures for Medicare 
beneficiaries.
195
 
Within the United States, the prices of 
certain types of drugs have been 
increasing over time, as discussed in 
section II of this proposed rule, which 
impacts spending in Part D and 
affordability of Part D coverage for 
Medicare beneficiaries. Brand-name 
drugs and biologics, in particular, 
represent a large portion of Part D 
spending in spite of the fact that generic 
drugs have a higher volume of use.
196 197
 
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 
(IRA), Public Law 117–169, addresses 
certain high drug costs under Part D, 
however, the IRA provisions— 
specifically the Drug Price Negotiation 
Program—focuses on a small set of 
drugs and only after they are available 
in the market for a period of time. The 
current Part D Inflation Rebate Program 
requires manufacturers to pay a rebate 
for certain drugs that exceed the rate of 
inflation based on price changes over 
time within the United States. While 
this approach is useful for curbing post- 
launch increases in drug prices, the Part 
D Inflation Rebate Program does not 
address the high launch prices of drugs, 
which continue to increase over time 
and contribute to high Medicare drug 
spending. 
Under the CMS Innovation Center’s 
statutory authority under section 1115A 
of the Act, CMS proposes to address this 
key issue of persistent high domestic 
Medicare drug spending for certain 
drugs and biologics through the GUARD 
Model, which tests changes to the Part 
D inflation rebate provision by 
implementing an innovative alternative 
payment method for the purpose of 
reducing Medicare drug spending and 
preserving or improving quality of care 
for Part D enrollees. 
This proposed rule is necessary to test 
and implement the alternative payment 
model that modifies the Part D inflation 
rebate calculation for GUARD Model 
drugs using international drug pricing 
information for the purpose of 
understanding whether this change 
results in reduced spending for 
Medicare and maintains or improves 
quality of care for Medicare Part D 
enrollees. Specifically, as described in 
section IV.F. of this proposed rule, the 
model would include testing more than 
one method for identifying a benchmark 
amount for the modified rebate 
calculation—namely, the default 
international benchmark (also referred 
to as Method I) and the updated 
international benchmark (also referred 
to as Method II). The evaluation would 
examine the impact of changing the Part 
D inflation rebate calculation for 
GUARD Model drugs. CMS expects that 
the innovative alternative rebate 
calculation would reduce Medicare Part 
D expenditures while preserving or 
enhancing beneficiaries’ quality of care. 
As detailed in section IV.A. of this 
proposed rule, the proposed GUARD 
Model would establish a 5-year 
performance period and a 7-year 
GUARD Model alternative payment test 
for a subset of Part D rebatable drugs 
that are dispensed to Medicare 
beneficiaries who are in the cohort and 
that are paid under the GUARD Model. 
As described in section IV.C. of this 
proposed rule, and subject to certain 
exclusions, participants would include 
manufacturers of proposed GUARD 
Model drugs. GUARD Model 
participants would be subject to the 
requirements during the GUARD Model 
test period, as described in section 
IV.C.2. of this proposed rule. 
B. Overall Impact 
We have examined the impacts of this 
proposed rule as required by Executive 
Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning 
and Review (September 30, 1993); 
Executive Order 13132 ‘‘Federalism’’; 
Executive Order 14192, ‘‘Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation’’; the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (Pub. 
L. 96–354); section 1102(b) of the Act 
(impact on small rural hospitals); 
section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (Pub. L. 
104–4). 
Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 
direct agencies to assess all costs and 
benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, 
environmental, public health and safety 
effects, distributive impacts, and 
equity). Section 3(f) of Executive Order 
12866 defines a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ as an any regulatory action that 
is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) 
have an annual effect on the economy 
of $100 million or more, or adversely

A regulatory impact analysis (RIA) 
must be prepared for a regulatory action 
that is significant under section 3(f)(1) 
of E.O. 12866. Based on our estimates, 
OMB’s Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has 
determined this rulemaking is 
significant per section 3(f)(1) of E.O. 
12866. Accordingly, we have prepared a 
regulatory impact analysis that presents, 
to the best of our ability, the estimated 
costs and benefits associated with this 
rulemaking. 
C. Accounting Statements and Tables 
As required by OMB Circular A–4,
198
 
in Table C1, we have prepared an 
accounting statement showing the 
transfers associated with the provisions 
of this proposed rule over a 6-year 
period spanning fiscal years 2028 
through 2033. This demonstrates that 
the first effects of the proposed GUARD 
Model that begins in January 2027 
would be observed in calendar year 
2028. We cannot accurately predict 
what will happen during the 
reconciliation years so only 6 years are 
presented. Table C1 is based on the 
analysis discussed in the ‘‘Estimated 
Impacts of the Proposal’’ Section in this 
RIA in this proposed rule. 
As stated later in this section, we 
estimate that the GUARD Model would 
result in an overall aggregate saving of 
$14.1 billion in Medicare Part D net 
spending during the model period. In 
this estimate, we assume manufacturer 
behavior changes. When annualized 
over a 6-year period, we estimate that 
the GUARD Model would result in an 
overall cost savings in Medicare Part D 
net spending of approximately $2.2 to 
2.3 billion when the effects of discount 
of 3 or 7 percent are taken into 
consideration. 
D. Estimated Impacts of the Proposal 
In this section of this proposed rule, 
we discuss the estimated overall impact 
of the proposed GUARD Model on 
Medicare spending (and specifically, the 
Medicare Prescription Drug Account in 
the Federal Supplementary Medical 
Insurance Trust Fund) and the impact 
on Part D enrollees; we also show that 
the information burden associated with 
these activities is negligible in 
comparison. 
1. Estimated Impacts to Medicare 
The proposed GUARD Model 
modifies the existing Part D inflation 
rebate calculation for certain Part D 
rebatable drugs administered to 
beneficiaries under Medicare Part D. For 
beneficiaries in model geographic areas, 
a performance year Medicare net price 
for model drugs will be compared to an 
international benchmark and the 
inflation-adjusted payment amount, 
with the manufacturer rebating any 
excess to CMS (referred to as the ‘‘Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount’’ as set forth at § 514.510(c)). 
The performance year Medicare Part D 
net price for GUARD is defined as the 
wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) minus 
the per unit manufacturer rebate (from 
direct and indirect remuneration (DIR)) 
and per unit manufacturer discount 
program payment amount. The rebates 
would exclude units that are currently 
exempt from the existing inflation 
rebate calculation, including units 
acquired through the 340B program. The 
proposed model would also exclude 
units dispensed to enrollees in 
employer group waiver plans (EGWPs) 
as beneficiaries enrolled in EGWPs are 
proposed to be excluded from the 
GUARD Model. Additionally, certain 
drugs may be excluded from the model 
based on therapeutic categories, 
spending thresholds, ineligibility for the 
inflation rebate program, or competitive 
status within the market. 
The estimates presented in this 
section of this proposed rule assume 
that all manufacturers are included in 
this mandatory model. If certain 
manufacturers were excluded due to 
interactions with other CMS Innovation 
Center models or for any other reason, 
the impacts from this proposed 
demonstration could be significantly 
less than described in this analysis. 
In developing our estimate of the 
potential GUARD Model spending 
impacts, we started with 2024 Part D 
claims data for GUARD Model drugs. 
The CMS Office of the Actuary (OACT) 
relied on the CMS Innovation Center for 
a list of drugs that would have been 
included in the model in 2024, and we 
estimate that GUARD Model drugs 
would have comprised approximately 
35 percent of non-EGWP Part D gross 
drug spending for 2024. The model 
excludes drugs that are paid based on a 
maximum fair price (MFP) that has been 
negotiated through the Medicare Drug 
Price Negotiation Program; as new drugs 
are selected for the negotiation program 
and have a payment limit that is based 
on the MFP, we expect the proportion 
of drugs targeted by the GUARD Model 
will decrease over time. 
We estimated which drugs would 
have an effective MFP during the model 
performance period and reduced the 
model rebate to account for the 
exclusion of these drugs from the 
model. OACT estimates of which drugs 
would be negotiated were developed 
independently, without input from the

Medicare Drug Rebate and Negotiation 
Group within CMS. 
By the end of the model, we estimate 
that GUARD Model drugs comprise 
approximately 16 percent of non-EGWP 
Part D drug spending for 2024, which 
reflects the increased amount of 
spending expected to be subject to the 
Medicare Drug Price Negotiation 
Program over time. 
The model geographic areas will be 
selected to comprise 25 percent of Part 
D beneficiaries, further reducing the 
drug spending targeted by the GUARD 
Model. The model also excludes 340B 
units. The Medicare Part D prescription 
drug event (PDE) data does not currently 
track whether a Part D claim is 340B; 
therefore, we assumed that 10 percent of 
Part D units were 340B based on 
estimates in available literature.

To reflect the international 
benchmarks that would be used in the 
model, we relied on international data 
furnished by the CMS Innovation 
Center, after adjustments for gross 
domestic product (GDP) and purchasing 
power parity (PPP). On average these 
international benchmarks were 
approximately 49 percent below the 
estimated Medicare Part D net price if 
GUARD was in effect in 2024, adjusted 
to reflect a 2027 benefit structure. This 
would reflect the upper limit of 
potential savings as we expect that 
manufacturers and other stakeholders 
may engage in a variety of responses 
that may reduce the potential Federal 
savings of the model. 
Our first anticipated manufacturer 
reaction is to report their international 
net pricing data to CMS in cases where 
that data shows higher prices than the 
GUARD Model default international 
benchmark (Method I). Under the 
GUARD Model, manufacturers would be 
eligible to voluntarily report 
international drug net pricing data, and 
if those prices are higher than the 
GUARD Model default international 
benchmarks, the GUARD Model 
updated international benchmarks 
(Method II) would become the GUARD 
Model applicable international 
benchmark for the GUARD Model rebate 
calculation for those GUARD Model 
drugs for which the international net 
pricing data is submitted. This effect 
would have an upward pressure on the 
GUARD Model applicable international 
benchmarks over time and would 
reduce the GUARD Model rebates paid 
by manufacturers. Manufacturers will 
need to overcome the difference 
between the prices used under the 
GUARD Model default international 
benchmarks (Method I) and the net 
prices submitted under the GUARD 
Model updated international 
benchmarks (Method II) to move the 
benchmarks higher. 
Our estimate assumes that the 
previous manufacturer reporting would 
reduce the level of total GUARD Model 
rebates by 30 percent by the end of the 
model test period. This assumption is 
informed by the average difference 
between lowest reference country price 
and prices averaged over all reference 
countries (after GDP (PPP) adjustments) 
for GUARD Model drugs. Table C2 
shows an example of how this response 
was measured for the pricing of a 
hypothetical drug. 
Manufacturers that increase 
international prices in response to the 
model will likely need time to 
implement changes to the international 
prices. Accordingly, we phased this 
adjustment into our analysis, beginning 
with a 10 percent change to 2026 
international price data and reaching 30 
percent in the 2029 international price 
data. These factors are applied at an 
aggregate level to the rebates calculated 
under the GUARD Model default 
international benchmarks. For example, 
the total GUARD rebate paid based on 
2027 utilization using the default 
international benchmark is reduced by 
10 percent in our impacts to reflect this 
manufacturer response. Table C3 shows 
the percentage adjustment by 
performance year: 
We anticipate that there will be some 
collaboration between manufacturers 
and providers to incentivize the 
increased use of brown-bagging, where 
drug utilization would be shifted to the 
office or facility setting and would be 
reimbursed under the Part B benefit, 
allowing the manufacturer to avoid 
owing a GUARD Model rebate amount

total Part D drug spending for GUARD 
Model drugs to comparable Healthcare 
Common Procedure Coding System 
(HCPCS) codes in the Part B program to 
identify drugs that have a high potential 
to be moved to the Part D benefit. 
Combined with assumptions about how 
much utilization would move, we 
estimate that this effect would further 
reduce the total GUARD Model rebate 
amounts by an additional 5 to 8 percent 
(dependent on year). 
The GUARD Model does not make 
any adjustments to the Part D benefit 
design and GUARD rebates would not 
be reflected at the point of sale; so, we 
do not expect any induced utilization 
effect for GUARD Model drugs. 
In addition to the manufacturer 
responses described previously, we 
considered other manufacturer 
reactions. Manufacturers could opt to 
change list prices in response to the 
model, but this will impact their pricing 
across the entire domestic market and 
would have unfavorable implications 
for inflation rebates outside of the 
model. Alternatively, manufacturers 
could increase rebates for Part D plan 
sponsors. This would reduce their 
liability for GUARD Model rebates, and 
perhaps enhance formulary positions for 
more utilization. However, these rebates 
would be expected both inside and 
outside of the model in negotiations 
with large plan sponsors and would be 
difficult to remove once the model is 
over. Lastly, we considered whether 
manufacturers could negotiate more 
aggressively for drugs selected for 
negotiation under the IRA. Because this 
response could be more proportional to 
the model, would be more flexible in 
response to actual GUARD impacts, and 
would be less obvious to stakeholders, 
we considered it the most likely option. 
We worked under the assumption that 
the manufacturers will negotiate more 
aggressively for upcoming selected 
drugs in the IRA’s Medicare Drug Price 
Negotiation Program, so that the 
maximum fair prices would be closer to 
the ceiling prices specified under the 
IRA than assumed absent the model. We 
determined how this will impact the 
Part D benefit. Because not all 
manufacturers will be able to respond 
for a particular years’ selected drugs, 
and because responses may vary, we 
assumed that 60 percent of the 
incremental GUARD rebate would be 
offset by the change in the OACT 
projection of negotiated prices. This 60 
percent assumption is based off similar 
situations OACT has encountered albeit 
in different rules and different contexts. 
Lowering this assumption to 50 percent 
would result in approximately 8 percent 
more federal savings. We invite 
stakeholder response on the most 
appropriate percentage for this. 
Once the total GUARD Model rebate 
is estimated as a percentage of gross 
drug costs, we apply those percentages 
to the estimated gross drug costs for 
each relevant year to obtain the 
aggregate GUARD Model rebate under 
the baseline gross drug costs. This 
amount is then reduced by the projected 
Part D inflation rebate amount 
attributable to the GUARD Model 
geography. The result is the estimated 
incremental GUARD rebate by year. 
We expect manufacturers to respond 
to the anticipated GUARD rebates 
beginning in the initial price 
applicability year 2028 negotiation 
cycle, moving the MFP closer to the 
ceiling prices defined in the IRA. 
Because of the timing requirements for 
the GUARD rebate, this means that the 
manufacturer response will take effect 
before the first expected GUARD rebate 
payment, which is expected to be paid 
in fiscal year 2029. 
This change in negotiated prices flows 
through the Part D benefit with impacts 
to Part D federal cost and beneficiary 
cost. The results are shown in Table C4 
on a fiscal year cash basis in billions. 
2. Estimated Impacts to Medicare Part D 
Enrollees 
As mentioned previously, we do not 
expect the GUARD rebates to be visible 
to beneficiaries at the point of sale. 
However, the assumed change in 
manufacturer negotiations for the IRA’s 
Medicare Drug Price Negotiation 
Program will impact beneficiaries’ cost 
sharing due to higher point of sale 
prices for initial price applicability year 
2028 and subsequent years. The change 
in manufacturer negotiations will also 
impact beneficiary premiums after the 
end of the IRA premium stabilization 
provisions. These impacts are shown in 
Table C5, on a calendar year basis in 
billions. 
3. Other Potential Responses 
We also considered the following 
responses but either determined their 
impact would be small or that we lacked 
sufficient data to properly quantify the 
level of impact they would have on 
GUARD Model rebates: 
€As a change in list prices for model drugs will shift the balance between the 
GUARD Model rebate amount and the 
inflation rebate amount, there are 
incentives for manufacturers to raise list 
prices across all payers to counteract the 
lost revenue from the model. This 
reaction could create additional effects

spending. The likelihood of this 
response increases when the spending 
for a given drug outside of Medicare is 
higher. We welcome comments on the 
probability and magnitude of this 
response to inform future analysis. 
€There also exists the possibility for manufacturers to increase DIR payments 
to plans in exchange for more favorable 
formulary placement and potential 
increased volume. This response would 
reduce GUARD unit rebates, but would 
be difficult to align with the GUARD 
Model structure. We would welcome 
comments on the probability and 
magnitude of this response to inform 
future analysis. 
€Since drugs selected for negotiation would be excluded from the model, we 
might expect manufacturers would try 
to change their pricing to become 
eligible for the Medicare Drug Price 
Negotiation Program if they see it being 
more favorable for their reimbursement. 
Given the criteria for drug selection 
under the Medicare Drug Price 
Negotiation Program, we believe it 
would be difficult for manufacturers to 
achieve this. Additionally, the model 
does not impact reimbursement for all 
Part D beneficiaries as negotiations 
would, so this response would require 
dramatic pricing differences to be 
favorable to manufacturers. 
We seek feedback on the assumptions 
used for this analysis, including 
anticipated stakeholder reactions, to 
inform future analysis. 
d. Collection of Information and 
Paperwork Cost 
As discussed in section V.A. of this 
proposed rule, as specified at section 
1115A(d)(3) of the Act, models are 
exempt from the requirements of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3501 through 3521). 
Nevertheless, and for discussional 
purposes only, we briefly review the 
main paperwork burden of this 
proposed rule and show it is negligible. 
The main information burden arises 
from voluntary manufacturer-reported 
submission of international net pricing 
information. The analysis of cost is 
summarized in Tables C6 and C7 with 
line items explained afterwards. Table 
C7 presents an analysis of items for 
which we have an experience basis for 
quantification. Table C8 discusses other 
items affecting the cost of submission 
requirements for which CMS has no 
prior experience on which to base 
quantification. To meaningfully deal 
with this lack of prior experience, we 
assume each item will increase the total 
quantifiable burden by some factor; a 
range of factors is presented to account 
for our lack of precise quantification. 
We next explain the various line 
items in sequential order. 
(1): We performed analysis on 
manufacturers of rebatable GUARD 
drugs based on two sources of 
manufacturers, FDA data sources 
(National Drug Code (NDC) Directory, 
Orange Book, and Purple Book) and 
Medi-Span.
200
There were 91 unique 
manufacturers. Although some of these 
manufacturers are owned by the same 
parent company, we used the higher 91 
figure because our goals are to show the 
negligibility of burden. 
(2), (3), and (4): The hours required 
for submission are split between 
preparation, including reading rules, 
gathering data, and so forth, and actual 
submission. We used similar estimates 
of submission to CMS from a 
Supporting Statement of the 
Manufacturer Submission of Average 
Sales Price (ASP) for Medicare Part B 
Drugs and Biologicals and Supporting 
Regulations in 42 CFR 414.800 through 
806 (CMS–10110, OMB 0938–0921) 
from 2023. The supporting document 
listed 10 hours for preparation and three 
hours for submission per submission. In 
contrast to OMB 0938–0921 which 
required four submissions per year, for 
GUARD there is only one submission 
per year. However, we believe that extra 
hours would be required for the first 
year, and in the absence of more reliable 
data we simply doubled the 10 and 
three. 
(7): The GUARD Model performance 
period, for which manufacturers could 
choose to report international drug net 
pricing data, is proposed to last from 
January 2027 through December 2031. 
(9a–9f): The $21.90 is the mean wage 
obtained from the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics website for Secretaries and 
Administrative Assistants, Occupational 
Code 43–6014, for the latest year 
available at this time, 2024. Note that 
CMS still uses mean wages even though 
many agencies use median wages. 
However, replacing the mean by the 
median would not change the 
conclusion of negligibility. 43–6014, is 
the same occupational title used for 
estimates in OMB 0938–0921. However,

we believe that this approach (using 
only administrative assistants) was 
overly simplified. While administrative 
assistants are appropriate staff for the 3 
hours submission, we believe the 
preparation would involve a team of 
administrative assistants, health care 
managers, software engineers, lawyers, 
and pharmacists. The mean hourly 
wages of these staff for 2024 are 
displayed along with their occupational 
titles and code. The wages of these five 
staff are combined to produce a single 
mean hourly wage for the team. In the 
absence of further data, the weights 
assume that all five staff work equally 
in the 10 hours of preparation resulting 
in 2 hours per staff. The administrative 
staff exclusively work during the three 
hours of submission. Thus, the weights 
are five-thirteenths for administrative 
staff and two-thirteenths for each of the 
other staff. 
(10): Per HHS guidance,
201
CMS uses 
a factor of two to account for overtime 
and fringe benefits. 
We next turn to items for which we 
have no basis on which to quantify. The 
total analysis is presented in Table C7. 
As noted in the table there are two non- 
quantifiable issues that have to be 
addressed. 
New and Departing participants: Each 
year, the group of GUARD Model 
participants may change based on 
whether their drug meets the criteria for 
inclusion in GUARD. We have no way 
of estimating with accuracy whether a 
given manufacturer would be included 
or excluded in GUARD. If we assume 
nine new manufacturers, then bottom 
line estimates from Table C7 would 
increase 10 percent (9/91). This is a low 
estimate. In a worst-case scenario, the 
number of participants might increase 
as much as 50 percent corresponding to 
a factor of 1.5; though this is unlikely, 
it helps define a range of possible costs. 
19 Countries: If a manufacturer were 
to opt to report manufacturer-submitted 
data, they would do so for up to 19 
countries. The 10 hours preparation 
assumed in Table C6 provides time for 
each GUARD participant to address 
marketing, pricing, and licensing 
requirements. But likely, this is different 
for different countries. We do not have 
enough information to quantify this. We 
approach the extra time as a factor by 
which we increase cost. For example, 
assuming that half the countries require 
the same preparation time, we would 
multiply the bottom line cost burden by 
a factor of 9.5 (19/2). On the other hand, 
if charts are readily available of 
licensing, marketing, and pricing for 
each individual country, it might only 
require an extra 2 hours of work 
resulting in an increase of 1.15 (2/13). 
We take these as the low and high 
estimates and insert an intermediate 
estimate. 
To obtain a range of adjusted bottom 
line estimates we multiply the factors 
together. For example, as just discussed 
previously, if half the countries require 
the same amount of work (resulting in 
a factor of 9.5) and if the number of 
participants increases 50 percent 
(resulting in a factor of 1.5) then we 
multiply the bottom line number from 
Table C6, $748,326, by 14.25 (1.5 *9.5) 
and obtain a high cost burden of $10.7 
million, as shown in Table C7. As 
shown on the bottom line of Table C7, 
the resulting range of estimates of cost 
burden is between roughly $1 million 
and $10.5 million. 
E. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act 
Analysis 
The RFA requires agencies to analyze 
options for regulatory relief for small 
entities. For purposes of the RFA, small 
entities include small businesses, 
nonprofit organizations, and small 
governmental jurisdictions. Individuals 
and states are not included in the 
definition of a small entity. The RFA 
requires that CMS analyze regulatory 
options for small businesses and other 
entities unless CMS certifies that a rule 
will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. The analysis must include a 
justification concerning the reason 
action is being taken, the kinds and 
number of small entities the proposed 
rule affects, and an explanation of any 
meaningful options that achieve the 
objectives with less significant adverse 
economic impact on the small entities. 
HHS considers a significant impact on 
a substantial number of small entities to 
be one with a three percent revenue 
effect on 5 percent of small entities.
202
 
As discussed in the preamble of this 
proposed rule, manufacturers that are 
GUARD Model participants would pay 
GUARD Model rebates to the Medicare 
Part D account in the Medicare 
Prescription Drug Account in the 
Federal Supplementary Medical

percent of the small entities’ annual 
revenue in the United States. Given the 
uncertainty, CMS concludes that this 
proposed rule, if finalized as proposed, 
will have significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small 
entities. This analysis, as well as other 
sections in this proposed rule, serves as 
the Initial Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis, as required by the RFA. 
F. Description and Number of Affected 
Small Entities 
We use the North American Industry 
Classification System (NAICS) to 
identify the industry potentially affected 
by the proposed rule. We also use the 
Small Business Administration (SBA) 
size standards to identify small 
entities,
203
as codified at 13 CFR 
121.201 and explained at Title 13 part 
121. The SBA considers any 
‘‘Pharmaceutical Preparation 
Manufacturing’’ firm (NAICS code 
325412) with fewer than 1,300 
employees as a small business. 
We use financial and employment 
information publicly available on 
annual reports published on companies’ 
websites or submitted to the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) for 
2024. Most companies self-identified as 
‘‘global’’ and provided information 
separately for their global consolidated 
business and for the United States. We 
used the Internal Revenue Service’s 
yearly average currency exchange rates 
for 2024 to convert revenue information 
into U.S. dollars when this information 
was provided in a foreign currency.
204
 
We identified 91 unique 
manufacturers belonging to 69 unique 
parent companies that would be 
associated with 542 unique NDC–9 
codes for GUARD Model drugs.
205
For 
purposes of this analysis, we consider 
the impact on the 69 unique parent 
companies. Table C8 shows that 26 
percent of the affected manufacturers 
would be considered small based on the 
SBA definition. In 2024, the total 
company revenue in the United States 
for these small companies exceeded $6 
billion. These companies accounted for 
about 0.6 percent (6,261/1,065,917) of 
the total U.S. revenue among all the 69 
affected entities. 
1. Description of the Potential Impacts 
on Small Entities 
We anticipate that payments to CMS 
in the form of rebate amounts would 
represent the largest impact to small 
entities. Table C9 presents the 
estimated, annual aggregate projected 
GUARD rebate amounts for small 
companies using the 2024 experience, 
adjusted for projected changes to 
GUARD eligibility and benchmarks by 
drug and by year. We categorized NDCs 
by the size of the parent manufacturer 
and summed the rebates for NDCs 
associated with manufacturers with 
1300 or fewer employees. Our analysis 
estimates that for small companies, the 
total GUARD rebates will comprise 
approximately 3.6 to 5 percent of total 
revenue, which, by HHS standards is 
considered significant. We note that 
these estimates are based on available 
data which could change in the future 
and as such, the estimated impacts 
could vary. Specifically, the estimates 
are based on the current status of 
rebatable drugs and employment and 
revenue information using 2024 (or 
other available data) as of the 
publication of this proposed rule. Given 
this uncertainty, we conclude that the 
proposed rule, if finalized as proposed, 
will have a significant impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. We 
welcome comments on our conclusion, 
approach, assumptions, and data used 
to estimate these impacts.

uncertainty around the assumptions for 
these estimates. We welcome comments 
on our estimate of significantly affected 
small manufacturers and the magnitude 
of estimated effects. We also welcome 
comments on adjustments to the 
GUARD Model that could be considered 
while preserving the innovative 
alternative payment approach tested 
under the GUARD Model. 
2. Alternatives To Minimize the Impact 
on Small Entities 
We considered the following 
alternatives to minimize the impact on 
small entities: (1) establishing a 
different spending threshold; (2) 
establishing an exemption process; and 
(3) establishing different compliance 
dates. 
€Spending threshold: CMS is excluding from the GUARD Model, 
GUARD Model drugs when their 
associated application-level total gross 
covered prescription drug costs are 
below the ‘‘GUARD Model minimum 
spend threshold’’ which for 
performance year one is proposed to be 
$69 million. This GUARD Model 
minimum spend threshold applies to all 
manufacturers irrespective of size. 
While lowering the GUARD Model 
minimum spend threshold increases the 
number of drugs that could be included 
in GUARD, it also increases the number 
of small manufacturers that could 
potentially be impacted. For this reason 
and others as discussed in section 
IV.B.2. of this proposed rule, CMS 
proposes not to select a higher 
threshold. Further, increasing the 
threshold reduces both the number of 
small and large manufacturers and the 
number of drugs in GUARD. 
€Exempting small entities: As discussed in section IV.B.2. of this 
proposed rule, to avoid interactions 
with other initiatives and programs that 
focus on manufacturers of Medicare Part 
D drugs, CMS would exclude drugs 
when there is an active price 
applicability period and the price of the 
drug is based on a negotiated MFP. 
Because small and large manufacturers 
could potentially be eligible for this 
proposed exclusion, we do not believe 
that additional processes for exemptions 
are needed. CMS seeks comments on 
other factors or considerations regarding 
exemptions for small entities. 
€Compliance dates: CMS also considered the flexibility of providing 
different compliance dates to small 
manufacturers. While creating 
significantly different compliance dates 
could provide more time for small 
manufacturers to comply, it could 
interfere with the statutory requirement 
of evaluating the model annually to 
determine whether the GUARD Model is 
reducing Medicare spending while 
preserving or increasing quality of care 
for Medicare Part D enrollees. 
In summary, the purpose of the 
GUARD Model is to test an innovative 
payment model that modifies the 
inflation rebate calculations for GUARD 
Model drugs using international drug 
pricing information. CMS expects 
would reduce program expenditures for 
Medicare Part D while preserving or 
enhancing beneficiaries’ quality of care. 
For this reason, CMS declined to 
propose the alternatives considered. We 
welcome comments on the alternatives 
considered as well as other factors that 
could be considered to mitigate the 
impact on small manufacturers. 
G. Effects on Small Rural Hospitals 
Section 1102(b) of the Act requires 
CMS to prepare an RIA if a rule may 
have a significant impact on the 
operations of a substantial number of 
small rural hospitals. This analysis must 
conform to the provisions of section 603 
of the RFA. For purposes of section 
1102(b) of the Act, we define a small 
rural hospital as a hospital that is 
located outside a Metropolitan 
Statistical Area and has fewer than 100 
beds. We are not preparing an analysis 
for section 1102(b) of the Act because 
we have determined, and the Secretary 
certifies, that this final rule would not 
have a significant impact on the 
operations of a substantial number of 
small rural hospitals. 
H. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
Section 202 of the UMRA also 
requires that agencies assess anticipated 
costs and benefits before issuing any 
rule whose mandates require spending 
in any one year of $100 million in 1995 
dollars, updated annually for inflation. 
In 2025, that threshold is approximately 
$187 million. The analysis of impacts 
on the GUARD Model does not report an 
estimate of any unfunded effect on 
State, local, or Tribal governments, in 
the aggregate, or on the private sector 
that exceeds the $187 million threshold. 
However, this proposed rule, if finalized 
as proposed, would result in additional 
impacts associated with changes in 
behavior; these are not quantified. 
Therefore, the Secretary has concluded 
that the requirements of section 202 of 
the UMRA have been met for the 
GUARD Model. We request comments, 
including on the potential magnitude of 
this impact 
I. Federalism 
Executive Order 13132 establishes 
certain requirements that an agency 
must meet when it promulgates a 
proposed rule that imposes substantial 
direct requirement costs on State and 
local governments, preempts State law, 
or otherwise has federalism 
implications. Since this proposed rule 
does not impose any substantial costs 
on State or local governments, preempt 
State law or have federalism 
implications, the requirements of 
Executive Order 13132 are not 
applicable. 
J. Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation 
E.O. 14192, titled ‘‘Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation,’’ was 
issued on January 31, 2025, and requires 
that ‘‘any new incremental costs 
associated with new regulations shall, to 
the extent permitted by law, be offset by 
the elimination of existing costs 
associated with at least 10 prior 
regulations.’’ 
VI. Response to Comments 
Because of the large number of public 
comments we normally receive on 
documents, we are not able to 
acknowledge or respond to them 
individually. We will consider all 
comments we receive by the date and 
time specified in the 
DATESsection of 
this preamble, and, when we proceed 
with a subsequent document, we will 
respond to the comments in the 
preamble to that document.

NCPDP units. 
Applicable submission means a 
voluntary manufacturer submission that 
CMS determines fulfils the data 
requirements, which include 
verification of the submission for 
completeness and validity, and 
therefore is suitable for determination of 
the GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark per 
§ 514.310(b). 
AMP stands for average manufacturer price.

reference country that are part of a 
GUARD Model drug’s set of 
international analogs, where, if 
available, the weights are the 
corresponding volumes of international 
product sold expressed in NCPDP units, 
and expressed as a per unit price, where 
the units are the GUARD Model drug’s 
NCPDP units.

corresponding performance year. 
(2) The reference country’s GDP (PPP) 
per capita and U.S. GDP (PPP) per 
capita must be for the same calendar 
year. The GDP (PPP) adjuster has a 
lower bound of 1.000, thus if the 
resulting GDP (PPP) adjuster is lower 
than 1.000, it is set to 1.000.

reference country identified at 
§ 514.220(d), where international drug 
pricing data is available from selected 
data sources per § 514.210 for at least 
one reference country and at least one 
reference country-level price can be 
calculated. 
GUARD Model drug means, subject to 
the exclusions set forth in § 514.120(c) 
a Part D rebatable drug, as defined in 42 
CFR 428.20 and determined in 42 CFR 
428.101, that is a sole-source drug or 
sole-source biological product as 
defined in § 514.100, has a United States 
Pharmacopeia (USP) category 
classification that includes at least one 
of the USP selected categories, as 
defined in § 514.120(e), and is 
identifiable by a unique National Drug 
Code (NDC) 9 code for which a payment 
was made under Medicare Part D.

GUARD Model performance period 
means the 5-year period beginning on 
January 1, 2027, through December 31, 
2031, as specified in § 514.1(c). 
GUARD Model updated international 
benchmark, which is also referred to as the Method II benchmark, means for 
each GUARD Model drug, the across- 
country average net price, which is a 
volume-weighted average across all 
reference countries, identified at 
§ 514.220(d), where an international 
product that is part of the set of 
international analogs is sold, and

country’s regulatory framework under a 
pathway similar to section 351(k) of the 
PHS Act in the United States. 
International generic means for a 
reference country identified in 
§ 514.220(d), a drug approved and 
marketed in a reference country under 
that reference country’s regulatory 
framework under a pathway similar to 
section 505(j) of the FD&C Act in the 
United States. 
International product means a drug or 
biological product sold in a reference 
country as identified in § 514.220(d) 
that is aligned across its identifying 
characteristics with a GUARD Model 
drug. The identifying characteristics are 
specific to each GUARD Model drug 
(which in accordance with § 514.120(a), 
is identified at the NDC–9 level) and 
include active ingredient(s), route of 
administration, dosage form, and 
strength. Alignment across identifying 
characteristics, as according to 
§ 514.410, allows for adjustments that 
do not materially modify the nature of 
the drug but account for country- 
specific differences such as differences 
due to language, units of measurement, 
labeling standards, or differences in 
dosage form or strength. 
Manufacturer has the meaning set forth in section 1927(k)(5) of the Act 
and § 428.20 of this chapter.

source of international drug pricing data 
for each GUARD Model drug’s set of 
international analogs that are sold in the 
reference countries determined in 
§ 514.220(d), CMS does the following 
prior to the GUARD Model rebate 
payment calculation: 
(1) For the first performance year, 
identifies available data sources of 
international drug pricing data. 
(2) For each subsequent performance 
year, identifies available data sources of 
international drug pricing data for any 
GUARD Model drug that was not a 
GUARD Model drug in a previous 
performance year or did not have a 
GUARD Model default international 
benchmark in a previous performance 
year. 
(b) Requirements for data sources of international drug pricing data. Data 
sources, as determined by CMS, must do 
all the following: 
(1) Utilize a standardized method for 
identifying drugs across countries 
within that data source, such as using 
internationally recognized scientific and 
nonproprietary product names. 
(2) Utilize a standard method for 
identifying a drug’s route of 
administration and dosage form across 
countries within that data source, such 
as using an internationally recognized 
nomenclature for pharmaceutical forms 
like the New Form Code classification. 
(3) Utilize a standard method for 
identifying a drug’s strengths across 
countries within that data source, and 
they are expressed in internationally 
recognized measures such as milligrams 
or milliliters. 
(4) Utilize a standard method to 
identify a drug’s regulatory approval 
pathway across countries within that 
data source, that at a minimum 
distinguishes international generics and 
international biosimilar biological 
products, as defined at § 514.5. 
(5) Contain at a minimum one of the 
following forms of drug pricing data and 
utilizes a standard method across 
countries within that data source to 
record the pricing data: 
(i) Coordinated sales and volume data, 
meaning a sales amount corresponding 
to a volume recorded in a standardized 
currency across countries within that 
data source, and which corresponds to 
actual or calculated transaction amount 
between a seller and a purchaser of a 
drug or biological product, and its 
corresponding volume, meaning the 
quantity of units—recorded in a 
standardized unit measure across 
countries within that data source— 
where the lowest dispensable amount is 
or can be converted into NCPDP units 
that correspond to the GUARD Model 
drug. 
(ii) Coordinated price and volume 
data, meaning a price recorded in a 
standardized currency across countries 
within that data source, and which 
corresponds to the price for an actual or 
calculated transaction between a seller 
and a purchaser of a drug or biological 
product, and its corresponding volume, 
meaning the quantity of units—recorded 
in a standardized unit measure across 
countries within that data source— 
where the lowest dispensable amount is 
or can be converted into NCPDP units 
that correspond to the GUARD Model 
drug. 
(iii) Price data, meaning a price 
recorded in a standardized currency 
across countries within that data source, 
and which corresponds to the price for 
an actual or calculated transaction 
between a seller and a purchaser of a 
drug or biological product.

maintain, update, validate, and correct, 
if necessary, the information on 
international drug pricing in the data 
source on at least a quarterly basis. 
(7) Be maintained by an organization 
that seeks to limit the lag inherent in 
data to no more than 90 calendar days 
from the end of the calendar quarter for 
which drug pricing information is 
compiled to the time that the 
organization makes the updates 
available to users of the data source. 
(c) Selection of data source. Subject to paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, 
for each GUARD Model drug, CMS 
selects a data source that CMS has 
access to that fulfills the requirements 
from paragraph (b) of this section, and, 
if available, obtains the data, to then 
calculate the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark for each 
GUARD Model drug as described in 
§ 514.410(c). 
(1) If there is more than one data 
source for a GUARD Model drug, CMS 
selects the data source at the highest 
level of the hierarchy described in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section and if 
there is still more than one data source 
for a GUARD Model drug at the same 
level, CMS selects a single data source 
based on an assessment of the relative 
reliability and generalizability of the 
data from each available data source. 
(2) Data selection hierarchy. (i) For each GUARD Model drug 
included in the first performance year, 
the following hierarchy is used to select 
the data source of international drug 
pricing information:

beginning on or after January 1, 2024, is 
used. 
(B) The data source contains 
coordinated prices and volume data the 
set of international analogs in the 
highest number of reference countries, 
identified in § 514.220(d), for— 
(1) Any duration of the 12-month 
period corresponding to the 12-month 
calendar year prior to the start of the 
first performance year; or 
(2) If data for the 12-month period 
corresponding to the 12-month calendar 
year prior to the start of the first 
performance year is not available, data 
for any duration of the most recent 
available prior 12-month period 
beginning on or after January 1, 2024, is 
used. 
(C) The data source contains price 
data for the set of international analogs 
in the highest number of reference 
countries, identified in § 514.220, for— 
(1) Any duration of the 12-month 
period corresponding to the 12-month 
calendar year prior to the start of the

Subpart E—Determination of the 
GUARD Model Applicable International 
Benchmark 
§ 514.410 Determination of the GUARD 
Model Applicable International Benchmark 
(a) General. For each GUARD Model drug, according to paragraph (b) of this 
section, CMS will designate a GUARD 
Model applicable international 
benchmark. 
(b) Determination of the GUARD Model applicable international 
benchmark— 
(1) CMS will identify the greater of 
the following for a GUARD Model drug 
for a performance year— 
(i) The GUARD Model default 
international benchmark (as determined 
in § 514.410(c)), as available; or 
(ii) The GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark (as determined 
in § 514.410(d)), as available. 
(2) CMS will multiply the identified 
benchmark from paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section by the applicable adjustment 
factor (as determined in paragraph (e) of 
this section) and designate the result as 
the GUARD Model applicable 
international benchmark. 
(c) Determination of the GUARD default international benchmark. (1) 
The GUARD Model default international 
benchmark is calculated for every 
GUARD Model drug using the selected 
data source according to § 514.210 prior 
to the GUARD Model rebate payment 
amount determination for the first 
performance year, according to the 
calculation steps in paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section, and this will be the default 
international benchmark for the 
performance period. 
(2) For any GUARD Model drug 
included in a subsequent performance 
year that was not part of the first 
performance year, or that did not have 
a GUARD Model default international 
benchmark in a previous performance 
year, the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark is calculated 
prior to the GUARD Model rebate 
payment amount determination for the 
corresponding subsequent performance 
year, and in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section, and this is the 
default international benchmark for the 
remainder of the performance period. 
(3) Steps in determining the GUARD Model default international benchmark. 
CMS will calculate the GUARD Model 
default international benchmark for 
each GUARD Model drug when there is 
available international drug pricing data 
from the selected data sources described 
in § 514.210 for at least one reference 
country among those identified in 
§ 514.220(d). 
(i) Identification of records from international drug pricing data. CMS 
will identify records for every 
international product that is part of a 
GUARD Model drug’s set of 
international analogs in the available 
12-months of international drug pricing 
data. 
(A) CMS will find records for 
international products that align with 
the GUARD Model drug’s active 
ingredient, route of administration, 
dosage form, and strength using the data 
sources’ standardized method for 
identifying scientific names or 
nonproprietary names, route of 
administration, dosage forms, and 
strengths, and CMS will make any 
necessary adjustments to the records to 
ensure alignment. 
(B) If CMS does not identify any 
records in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this 
section for a reference country, CMS 
will find records for said reference 
country for any international products 
that align with the GUARD Model 
drug’s active ingredient, route of 
administration, and dosage form using 
the data sources’ standardized method 
for identifying scientific names or 
nonproprietary names, route of 
administration, and dosage forms, and 
CMS will make any necessary 
adjustments to the records to ensure 
alignment. If CMS identifies— 
(1) Only one international product, 
then its records are retained. 
(2) More than one international 
product, and the relative difference in 
terms of strength between the two 
closest (in absolute terms) international 
product’s strengths and the GUARD 
Model drug’s strength compared to the 
relative difference in prices for those 
same two strength-misaligned 
international products is— 
(i) Equal to or greater than half of the 
relative strength difference, then CMS 
will retain the records for the 
international product whose strength is 
closest in magnitude to the strength of 
the GUARD Model drug. 
(ii) If the relative price difference is 
less than half of the relative strength 
difference, then CMS will retain records 
for both international products with the 
closest strengths in absolute terms to the 
GUARD Model drug. 
(iii) In the case of ties, CMS will 
default to retaining records for the 
lower-strength international product. 
(C) CMS will identify among the 
records retained from paragraph 
(c)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, 
records for international products that 
the data source reports as an 
international generic or an international 
biosimilar biological product according 
to the reference country’s regulatory 
framework. CMS will exclude these 
records from the calculation of the 
GUARD Model default international 
benchmark. 
(D) CMS will identify among the 
records retained from paragraph 
(c)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, 
records for international products where 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  19:09 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00087 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\23DEP3.SGM 23DEP3
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS360424 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules the data source reports pricing 
information with a value of zero or less 
than zero. 
(ii) Data sufficiency for GUARD Model default international benchmark 
calculation. If the data resulting from paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section— 
(A) Has records for at least one 
international product in any reference 
country, CMS will proceed to the 
calculation in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of 
this section. 
(B) Has no records for any 
international product in any reference 
country, the GUARD Model drug does 
not have a GUARD Model default 
international benchmark and therefore 
no GUARD Model rebate payment is 
calculated for that performance year. 
(iii) Steps for calculation of the GUARD Model default international 
benchmark—(A) Calculation of the country-level average price. For each 
reference country with records 
identified per paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this 
section, CMS will calculate an average 
price per NCPDP unit of the GUARD 
Model drug using all records for that 
reference country. 
(1) If the data source contains 
coordinated sales and volume or 
coordinated prices and volume, for each 
record of selected data for a reference 
country, CMS will— 
(i) If contained in the data source and 
appropriate, CMS will convert sales 
amounts so that the sales amount is 
expressed in terms of the GUARD Model 
drug’s NCPDP unit; 
(ii) If contained in the data source and 
appropriate, CMS will multiply prices 
by the corresponding volume, where the 
volume is expressed in terms of the 
GUARD Model drug’s NCPDP unit; 
(iii) If the resulting amounts from 
paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A)(1)(i) or (ii) are 
not in U.S. dollars, CMS will convert 
the local currency to U.S. dollars using 
the exchange rate for currency 
conversion from the selected data 
source. 
(iv) CMS will multiply the results 
from paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A)(1)(iii) by 
the GDP (PPP) adjuster as defined at 
§ 514.5. 
(v) CMS will calculate the total 
volume as a sum of all the volumes for 
each record of selected data for a 
reference country, converted if needed 
to be expressed in terms of the GUARD 
Model drug’s NCPDP unit. 
(vi) CMS will calculate the total 
volume-weighted price as a sum of all 
the volume-weighted prices from 
paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A)(1)(iv) of this 
section. 
(vii) CMS will divide the total 
volume-weighted prices from paragraph 
(c)(3)(iii)(A)(1)(vi) of this section by the 
total volume described in paragraph 
(c)(3)(iii)(A)(1)(v) of this section to 
obtain a country-level average price. 
(2) If the data source contains only 
prices, for each record of selected data 
for a reference country, CMS will do all 
of the following: 
(i) Sum of all the prices for each 
record of selected data for a reference 
country, converted if needed to be 
expressed in terms of the GUARD Model 
drug’s NCPDP unit, converting if needed 
from a local currency to U.S. dollars 
using the exchange rate for currency 
conversion from the selected data 
source. 
(ii) Multiply the results from 
paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A)(2)(i) of this 
section by the GDP (PPP) adjuster as 
defined at § 514.5. 
(iii) Divide the result from paragraph 
(c)(3)(iii)(A)(2)(ii) of this section by the 
number of records used in from 
paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A)(2)(i) to obtain the 
country-level average price. 
(B) Selection of the GUARD Model default international benchmark. 
Among all the country-level average 
prices obtained from paragraph 
(c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the lowest 
amount, in absolute terms, is designated 
as the GUARD Model default 
international benchmark. 
(d) Determination of the GUARD Model updated international 
benchmark. 
(1) CMS determines the GUARD 
Model updated international benchmark 
for each GUARD Model drug, when 
there is an applicable submission per 
§514.310, prior to the GUARD Model 
rebate payment amount determination 
for a performance year. 
(2) The across-country average net 
price data element from the net pricing 
data elements of an applicable 
submission as described in §

514.310, is 
the GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark. 
(e) Applicable adjustment factor. When the GUARD Model applicable 
international benchmark is based on 
the— 
(1) GUARD Model default 
international benchmark, the applicable 
adjustment factor is 102 percent. 
(2) GUARD Model updated 
international benchmark, the applicable 
adjustment factor is 105 percent.

drug, as determined under paragraph (b) 
of this section, and the total units of the 
GUARD Model drug dispensed under 
Part D for GUARD Model beneficiaries, 
as determined under paragraph (d) of 
this section. 
(b) Formula for calculating the per unit GUARD Model rebate amount. 
Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, CMS will calculate the per unit 
GUARD Model rebate payment amount 
for a GUARD Model drug by 
determining the amount by which the 
performance year Medicare net price for 
the drug, as calculated in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
exceeds the applicable international 
benchmark. 
(1) Calculation of the performance year Medicare net price. CMS will 
calculate the performance year Medicare 
net price by using WAC to calculate the 
performance year aggregate gross price, 
subtracting certain manufacturer rebates 
(from DIR) and discounts (from the 
Manufacturer Discount Program) from 
that aggregate price to produce the 
performance year aggregate net price, 
and dividing that net price by the 
quantity dispensed to produce a per 
unit price. 
(i) Performance year aggregate gross price. For each GUARD Model drug, CMS will identify all PDE records for all 
NDC–11s associated with the NDC–9 of 
the GUARD Model drug with dates of 
service during the performance year. 
The performance year aggregate gross 
price is equal to the WAC for the 
GUARD Model drug, multiplied by the 
quantity dispensed reported on the PDE 
record, summed across all PDE records 
identified. 
(A) For each PDE record, CMS will 
use third party sources to identify the 
WAC using the NDC–11. If there was no 
WAC available for an NDC–11, but there 
is an available WAC for another NDC– 
11 associated with the NDC–9 of the 
GUARD Model drug, CMS will use this 
available WAC. 
(B) For each PDE record, CMS will 
identify the WAC in effect on the date 
of service reported on the PDE record. 
(1) If there is not an effective WAC as 
of the date of service for any PDE 
records during the performance year, 
CMS will use the most recently effective 
WAC available. 
(2) If the GUARD Model drug has 
some PDE records during the 
performance year for which there is an 
effective WAC as of the date of service, 
but other PDE records during the 
performance year for which there is not 
an effective WAC as of the date of 
service, CMS will impute a WAC for the 
latter category of PDE records based on 
the available WAC that was in effect 
most recently before the date of service 
on the PDE record. 
(3) If there was no WAC in effect 
before the date of service on the PDE 
record, but there was a WAC in effect 
after the date of service, CMS will use 
the WAC that was in effect after the date 
of service and this would be applied to 
that PDE record. 
(C) If there is no WAC available for 
any NDC–11 associated with the NDC– 
9 of the GUARD Model drug, CMS will 
not calculate a performance year 
aggregate gross price or issue a GUARD 
Model Rebate Report for that 
performance year. 
(ii) Performance year aggregate net price. The performance year aggregate net price is equal to the performance 
year aggregate gross price determined 
under paragraph (i) of this section, 
minus the following amounts: 
(A) The sum of manufacturer rebates 
found in the Detailed DIR Report for the 
performance year across all plans for all 
NDC–11s associated with the NDC–9 of 
a GUARD Model Part D rebatable drug. 
(B) Manufacturer discounts provided 
under the Medicare Part D Manufacturer 
Discount Program and obtained from the 
amounts reported on PDE records for 
the GUARD Model drug for the 
performance year. For a GUARD Model 
drug eligible for the phase-in under 
section 1860D–14C(g)(4)(B) or 1860D– 
14C(g)(4)(C) of the Act, the amount 
determined under this paragraph is 
equal to the amount the manufacturer 
would have paid in discounts under the 
Medicare Part D Manufacturer Discount 
Program during the performance year if 
the GUARD Model Part D rebatable drug 
had not been eligible for the phase-in. 
(iii) Convert to a per unit price. The performance year Medicare net price is 
equal to the amount determined under 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, 
divided by the sum of the amounts 
reported in the quantity dispensed field 
across all PDE records identified in 
paragraph (d) of this section. 
(2) Exception. In instances when the applicable international benchmark set 
forth at § 514.410 is equal to zero, the 
per unit GUARD Model rebate payment 
amount is equal to zero. 
(c) Calculation of the incremental per unit GUARD Model rebate amount and 
the Total Incremental GUARD Model 
rebate amount—(1) Incremental per unit GUARD Model rebate amount. (i) 
Subject to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this 
section, the incremental per unit 
GUARD Model rebate amount is equal 
to the per unit GUARD Model rebate 
payment amount, as set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section, minus the 
performance year per unit Part D 
inflation rebate amount, as set forth at 
§ 514.500 for the GUARD Model drug. 
(ii) To the extent the amount 
determined under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of 
this section is less than or equal to zero, 
the incremental per unit GUARD Model 
rebate amount is equal to zero. 
(2) Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate amount. (i) The Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount is equal to the product of the 
incremental per unit GUARD Model 
rebate amount determined under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the 
total units of the GUARD Model drug

following adjustments: 
(i) The methodology applies as if 
references to ‘‘applicable period’’ are 
references to ‘‘performance year.’’ 
(ii) The methodology does not apply 
as set forth at 42 CFR 428.203(a)(2) to 
crosswalk to AMP units. 
(2) From the total units identified in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, CMS 
will remove units for PDE records that 
are not associated with a GUARD Model 
beneficiary. 
§ 514.520 Reducing the Total Incremental 
GUARD Model rebate amount for GUARD 
Model drugs in shortage or when there is 
a severe supply chain disruption or likely

Model rebate amount; 
(B) One minus the product of— 
(1) The applicable percent reduction 
determined under 42 CFR 428.301(b)(2) 
for the applicable period that overlaps 
with the performance year and during 
which the GUARD Model drug was a 
Part D rebatable drug; and 
(2) The percentage of time the GUARD 
Model drug was currently in shortage 
during that applicable period 
determined by CMS under 42 CFR 
428.301(b)(3). 
(3) Application of reduction. CMS will apply a reduction of the Total 
Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount as determined under paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section to the GUARD 
Model drug at the NDC–9 level. 
(b) Reducing the Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate amount for 
certain GUARD Model drugs when there 
is a severe supply chain disruption—(1) 
General. CMS will reduce the Total Incremental GUARD Model rebate 
amount determined under 
§ 514.510(c)(2) for a generic GUARD 
Model drug or biosimilar biological 
product if CMS determines that a severe 
supply chain disruption occurred 
during an applicable period that 
overlaps with the performance year. A 
severe supply chain disruption includes 
disruptions caused by a natural disaster 
or other unique or unexpected event as 
set forth in § 428.300.

Department of Labor; Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services, 
Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: These proposed rules set forth proposed requirements that would 
amend the regulations under the Public 
Health Service Act, the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 
and the Internal Revenue Code 
regarding price transparency reporting 
requirements for non-grandfathered 
group health plans and health insurance 
issuers offering non-grandfathered 
group and individual health insurance 
coverage. Specifically, these proposed 
rules would improve the 
standardization, accuracy, and 
accessibility of public pricing 
disclosures in line with the goals of the 
Executive Order 14221. With respect to 
the in-network rate and out-of-network 
allowed amount machine-readable files, 
these proposed rules would achieve 
these goals by adding new contextual 
files and additional data elements like 
product type, network name, and 
enrollment counts; changing the 
reporting level for aggregation of data; 
removing in-network rates for unlikely 
provider-to-service mappings; 
increasing the reporting period and 
lowering the claims threshold for out-of- 
network historical data; and reducing 
the reporting cadence. These proposed 
rules would also improve the findability 
of all of the publicly disclosed machine- 
readable files required under the 
Transparency in Coverage rules, 
including the prescription drug file, by 
requiring a text file and footer with 
website URLs and contact information 
for the files. These proposed rules 
would also require pricing information 
that is made available through an online 
consumer tool and paper (upon request), 
to also be made available by phone, and 
establish that the satisfaction of such 
requirement also satisfies the 
requirements of section 114 of the No 
Surprises Act (including for 
grandfathered group health plans and 
health insurance issuers offering 
grandfathered group and individual 
health insurance coverage that are not 
otherwise subject to these proposed 
rules).

Plain Language Summary: In 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(4), a

may be found at https://
www.regulations.gov/. 
I. Executive Summary 
A. Purpose 
The Departments of Labor, Health and 
Human Services (HHS), and the 
Treasury (collectively, the Departments) 
issued proposed requirements in the 
2019 Transparency in Coverage 
proposed rules (2019 proposed rules)
1
 
and finalized the rules in 2020 (the 2020 
final rules).
2
The rules aimed to provide 
consumers with price and benefit 
information that would enable them to 
better evaluate health care options and 
make cost-conscious decisions; reduce 
surprises in consumers’ out-of-pocket 
costs for health care services; create a 
competitive dynamic that would begin 
to narrow price differences for the same 
services in the same health care 
markets; foster innovation by providing 
industry the information necessary to 
support informed, price-conscious 
consumers in the health care market; 
and, over time, potentially lower overall 
health care costs.
3
 
The public disclosures made pursuant 
to the 2020 final rules led to the release 
of an enormous amount of previously 
hidden pricing data. However, post- 
implementation, the Departments 
continue to receive feedback from users 
of the machine-readable files 
emphasizing the need to address certain 
gaps in reporting and shrink file size by 
reducing duplication and removing 
unnecessary data. Since the finalization 
of the 2020 final rules, the Departments 
have also received feedback from many 
interested parties about the myriad ways 
in which plans and issuers contract 
with providers for items and services 
that impact the usability of the data 
disclosed under the rules. 
On February 25, 2025, President 
Trump issued Executive Order 14221, 
‘‘Making America Healthy Again by 
Empowering Patients With Clear, 
Accurate, and Actionable Healthcare 
Pricing Information’’ (Executive Order 
14221).
4
Among other things, Executive 
Order 14221 directs the Departments to 
take all necessary and appropriate 
action, including issuing proposed 
regulatory action to promote more 
transparency in health care pricing 
information. In line with the goals of 
Executive Order 14221, the Departments 
propose several amendments to the 
2020 final rules to improve the 
standardization, accuracy, and 
accessibility of pricing information. 
Based on internal assessment and 
external feedback from interested 
parties, the Departments have identified 
three main barriers to fully achieving 
the goals of the 2020 final rules: 
inaccessibility due to the size of the 
machine-readable files, ambiguity 
regarding some of the data disclosures 
due to a lack of contextual information 
alongside the raw data, and 
misalignment with the ‘‘2019 Medicare 
and Medicaid Programs: CY 2020 
Hospital Outpatient PPS Policy Changes 
and Payment Rates and Ambulatory 
Surgical Center Payment System Policy 
Changes and Payment Rates. Price 
Transparency Requirements for 
Hospitals To Make Standard Charges 
Public’’ rule
5
(2019 Hospital Price 
Transparency rule) that makes 
comparing data across disclosures 
challenging. 
The Departments understand that the 
large size of many of the required 
machine-readable files, particularly the 
in-network rate machine-readable file 
(In-network Rate File), is the most 
prominent challenge with working with 
the machine-readable files. Academics 
and researchers,
6
data engineers,
7
health 
plans and health insurance issuers,
8
and 
members of Congress
9
have stated that 
these large file sizes create several 
problems for file users seeking to open 
and analyze the files, as well as for 
health plans and health insurance 
issuers reporting that amount of data. 
For file users, the amount of data to sift 
through monthly requires significant 
resources and time. Smaller datasets are 
easier to analyze and cheaper to 
maintain. For plans and issuers, large 
files have large data storage, 
maintenance, and bandwidth costs. The 
amount of data being generated monthly 
can also lead to increased errors in the 
files, making it difficult for plans and 
issuers to ensure they are compliant 
with the disclosure requirements and 
for file users to be confident in the 
integrity of the data being reported. 
Reducing the collective burden from 
large file sizes and making it easier for 
all users to work with the data in the 
machine-readable files are among the 
driving goals of these proposed rules. 
With the 2020 final rules, the 
Departments expected the public 
disclosure of pricing information related 
to health care items and services to help 
both uninsured and insured individuals 
in their health care and health coverage 
purchasing decisions. As stated in the 
preamble to the 2020 final rules, 
research indicates that having access to 
pricing information can increase 
consumers’ overall satisfaction and 
provide opportunities for education and 
engagement on health care pricing.
10
 
Price transparency enables consumers 
to evaluate health care options and 
make cost-conscious decisions, allowing 
for the possibility of a competitive 
dynamic that may narrow price 
dispersion for the same items and 
services in the same health care markets 
and put downward pressure on prices 
and potentially lower overall health care 
costs.
11
Since the publication of the 
2020 final rules, researchers have 
continued to analyze price transparency 
in health care with the benefit of access 
to the data provided largely by the 
machine-readable files.

Some researchers have identified 
significant potential cost-savings across 
the health insurance landscape through 
greater use of the machine-readable file 
data.
12
Recent discussions extol the 
potential benefits of price transparency, 
echoing the reasons the Departments 
emphasized in the 2020 final rules. 
These include effects on the demand for 
health care by ‘‘guiding patients to 
lower-priced providers’’ and to the 
supply side by ‘‘promot[ing] price 
competition among providers,’’
13
as 
well as benefits to employers to 
‘‘redesign health benefits and inform 
purchasing decisions.’’
14
One analysis 
emphasized a range of benefits, from 
‘‘optimizing current contracts’’ to 
‘‘increasing the accuracy of performance 
assumptions, market analysis, and 
strategic value.’’
15
Early analyses of the 
potential financial and economic 
impacts of the 2020 final rules show 
promise for fulfilling the goals the 
Departments articulated in the 2020 
final rules of ‘‘facilitating a market- 
driven heath care system by giving 
consumers of health care services data 
that will enable consumers to make 
fully informed, cost-conscious decisions 
when choosing health care.’’
16
 
While the machine-readable file 
requirements of the 2020 final rules and 
the 2019 Hospital Price Transparency 
rule do not require the exact same 
disclosures, they have similar goals and 
some overlapping data. Therefore, it can 
be useful to review studies of hospital 
machine-readable files for lessons 
learned and outcomes that may translate 
to the plan and issuer machine-readable 
file disclosures. One study using 
hospital data found that ‘‘choosing 
plans from the largest insurer in the 
local market is more likely to result in 
lower negotiated rates than from other 
plans,’’ which can lead to reduced costs 
for the ‘‘growing number of self-insured 
employers engaged in direct contracts 
with hospitals.’’
17
One county 
government used hospital data in this 
manner to reduce its health costs by 
over 40 percent.
18
Tools allowing 
comparison of the hospital data recently 
began populating the internet. The 
Departments are also aware of app 
developers conducting similar analyses 
of the data from plan and issuer 
disclosures and offering them to 
consumers (both individuals and 
employers). The Departments expect 
that continued analyses and 
development of consumer-facing tools 
and services will result in similar 
savings opportunities achieved from 
studying the hospital machine-readable 
files. 
However, the success of these 
analyses and the effectiveness of 
consumer-facing tools depend on the 
usability of the machine-readable files. 
Large file sizes, lack of clarity, and data 
of limited use hamper efforts to build 
tools that can be brought to market. 
These proposed changes, if finalized, 
would contribute to making the files 
easier to digest and analyze, reduce 
challenges for existing tool developers, 
and open the market to additional tool 
and app developers. 
The Departments seek to address the 
limitations of the machine-readable files 
through these proposed rules as well as 
through updates to the machine- 
readable file form and manner 
requirements as detailed in technical 
implementation guidance. As a first step 
towards addressing these limitations, on 
May 22, 2025, the Departments 
announced in FAQs Part 70 the 
intention to release schema version 2.0 
(Schema 2.0), which will implement 
revised technical requirements for the 
In-network Rate File and out-of-network 
allowed amounts and billed charges 
machine-readable file (Allowed Amount 
File).
19
However, the Departments also 
recognize that more substantive 
requirements are needed to clarify the 
data being published and to give users 
more confidence in the data. Feedback 
from interested parties demonstrates 
that, while the raw data from the 
machine-readable files presents valuable 
information and opportunities for 
analysis, additional contextual 
information is needed to supplement 
the in-network rates and out-of-network 
allowed amounts and billed charges 
disclosed in the machine-readable files. 
Additional contextual information 
would allow users to understand 
changes in pricing over time, promote 
more accurate reporting, and make 
pricing information more meaningful 
and accessible overall. Therefore, the 
Departments are issuing these proposed 
rules as a next step to addressing these 
concerns. 
The disclosure requirements under 
the Transparency in Coverage rules 
represent just one prong in a 
multipronged approach to promote 
greater transparency and understanding 
of costs and pricing in the health care 
and the health insurance market. The 
2020 final rules must be viewed within 
the context of other regulatory and 
statutory changes, such as the Hospital 
Price Transparency initiative, as well as 
Title I of Division BB of the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 
(CAA), also known as the No Surprises 
Act, and its consumer protections 
against surprise billing, its requirements 
for a good faith estimate, advanced 
explanation of benefits, and more 
accurate provider directories. With 
respect to the Hospital Price 
Transparency and the Transparency in 
Coverage initiatives in particular, 
section 3(b) of Executive Order 14221 
instructed the Departments to ‘‘issue 
updated guidance or proposed 
regulatory action ensuring pricing 
information is standardized and easily 
comparable across hospitals and health 
plans.’’
20
The Departments received 
encouraging feedback that ‘‘commercial 
prices disclosed in the TiC 
[Transparency in Coverage] data are 
mostly comparable to those disclosed by 
hospitals in compliance with the 
hospital price transparency rule and to 
Marketscan [sic] claims data.’’

While PHS Act section 2715A does not apply

Code, section 719 of ERISA, and section 2799A–4 
Continued 
However, other interested parties have 
noted that, despite the consistency of 
the raw data across hospital and plan 
and issuer machine-readable files, there 
are other challenges in comparing the 
information between the two sets of 
machine-readable files.
22
Therefore, the 
Departments intend in these proposed 
rules, along with Schema 2.0, to help 
align the Hospital Price Transparency 
reporting requirements and the 2020 
final rules, as well as to fulfill the 
directive under Executive Order 14221. 
Additionally, to better inform a 
response to Executive Order 14221, on 
June 2, 2025, the Departments published 
a Request for Information (RFI) seeking 
the public’s input on ways to effectively 
implement or amend the prescription 
drug machine-readable file requirement 
in the 2020 final rules.
23
 
Building off of the 2020 final rules, 
the Departments propose these rules 
pursuant to the authority under Section 
2715A of the Public Health Service 
(PHS) Act, incorporated into section 715 
of the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act (ERISA) and section 9815 
of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), 
which provide that non-grandfathered 
group health plans and health insurance 
issuers offering non-grandfathered 
group or individual health insurance 
coverage must comply with section 
1311(e)(3) of the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care 
Act). This section of the Affordable Care 
Act addresses transparency in health 
coverage and imposes certain reporting 
and disclosure requirements on health 
plans that are seeking certification as 
qualified health plans (QHPs) that may 
be offered on an Exchange (as defined 
by section 1311(b)(1) of the Affordable 
Care Act). 
The Departments also propose these 
rules pursuant to the authority under 
the No Surprises Act, which amended 
chapter 100 of the Code, Part 7 of 
ERISA, and title XXVII of the PHS Act. 
Among other protections, the No 
Surprises Act provides Federal 
protections against surprise billing by 
limiting out-of-network cost sharing and 
prohibiting balance billing in many of 
the circumstances in which surprise 
bills most frequently arise. Section 114 
of the No Surprises Act added Code 
section 9819, ERISA section 719, and 
PHS Act section 2799A–4, which 
require plans and issuers to offer price 
comparison guidance by telephone and 
make a ‘‘price comparison tool’’ 
available on the plan’s or issuer’s 
website. 
B. Summary of the Major Provisions 
1. Transparency in Coverage— 
Definitions 
The 2020 final rules include 
definitions at 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A1(a)(2); 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A1(a)(2); and 45 CFR 147.210(a)(2). 
These proposed rules, if finalized, 
would add a definition of the term 
health insurance market for purposes of 
amendments to 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(1)(ii), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(1)(ii), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(1)(ii) that would require 
group health plans and health insurance 
issuers offering group or individual 
health insurance coverage to make an 
out-of-network allowed amount 
machine-readable file available for each 
health insurance market in which the 
plan or issuer offers a plan or coverage. 
Under 26 CFR 54.9815–2715A1 and 45 
CFR 147.210, the Departments propose 
to redesignate paragraphs (a)(2)(xi) 
through (xxii) as paragraphs (a)(2)(xii) 
through (xxiii), respectively, and add a 
new paragraph (a)(2)(xi) with the new 
definition. Under 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A1, the Departments propose to 
redesignate paragraphs (a)(2)(x) through 
(xxi) as paragraphs (a)(2)(xi) through 
(xxii) and add a new paragraph (a)(2)(x) 
with the new definition. 
2. Transparency in Coverage—Required 
Disclosures to Participants, 
Beneficiaries, or Enrollees 
The 2020 final rules at 26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A2; 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A2; and 45 CFR 147.211 require 
non-grandfathered group health plans 
and health insurance issuers offering 
non-grandfathered coverage in the group 
and individual markets to make cost- 
sharing information available to 
participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees 
through an internet-based self-service 
tool (self-service tool), and in paper 
form, upon request. 
The Departments propose to amend 
paragraph (b)(1)(vii)(A) of this section to 
require the disclaimer, described in that 
paragraph, to state that the cost-sharing 
information does not account for 
potential additional amounts in 
situations where applicable State and 
Federal law allow out-of-network 
providers to balance bill participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees. This 
proposed amendment reflects the 
existence of the Federal balance billing 
protections set forth in the No Surprises 
Act, which was not in effect when 
(b)(1)(vii)(A) was finalized in the 2020 
final rules. The Departments also 
propose to clarify that the disclaimer is 
not required if the State in which the 
item or service was furnished prohibits 
all out-of-network providers from 
balance billing for all items and services 
payable by the plan or issuer. 
In addition, the Departments propose 
to add a new paragraph at (b)(2)(iii) 
under this section to require plans and 
issuers to make available to participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees the cost- 
sharing estimates and other disclosures 
required under paragraph (b)(1) via a 
telephone number to implement 
requirements under section 9819 of the 
Code, section 719 of ERISA, and PHS 
Act Section 2799A–4, as added by 
section 114 of the No Surprises Act.
24
 
The Departments propose to require a 
telephone number through which a 
consumer may seek customer assistance 
which would be required to be the same 
number that Code section 9816(e), 
ERISA section 716(e), and PHS Act 
section 2799A–1(e), as added by section 
107 of the No Surprises Act requires be 
indicated on any physical or electronic 
plan or insurance identification card 
issued to a participant, beneficiary, or 
enrollee. The Departments also propose 
to redesignate paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) as 
new paragraph (b)(2)(iv) and amend 
redesignated paragraph (b)(2)(iv) to 
remove phone as an alternative means 
by which a participant, beneficiary, or 
enrollee can request the disclosures 
required under paragraph (b)(1). 
The Departments also propose to add 
a new paragraph (c)(7) stating that plans 
and issuers satisfy the requirements set 
forth in Code section 9819, ERISA 
section 719, and PHS Act section 
2799A–4 regarding the price 
comparison tool by providing the 
information to participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees set forth in 
paragraph (b)(1) as amended in 
accordance with the method and format 
requirements set forth in paragraph 
(b)(2), as amended.

plans and issuers offering grandfathered health 
insurance coverage. 
3. Transparency in Coverage— 
Requirements for Public Disclosure 
The Transparency in Coverage final 
rules at 26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3; 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3; and 45 CFR 
147.212 require non-grandfathered 
group health plans and health insurance 
issuers offering non-grandfathered 
group and individual health insurance 
coverage to disclose on a public website, 
in the format of machine-readable files, 
information regarding in-network 
provider rates for covered items and 
services, out-of-network allowed 
amounts and billed charges for covered 
items and services, and negotiated rates 
and historical net prices for covered 
prescription drugs. 
The Departments propose a number of 
amendments that would apply to the 
disclosure of information required 
under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2). First, 
the Departments propose to amend the 
introductory paragraph of (b) to 
reference new requirements for the 
public disclosure of contextual 
information and to redesignate 
paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(3) as 
paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(4), 
respectively, and add a new paragraph 
(b)(2) describing the proposed 
contextual information disclosure 
requirements for the In-network Rate 
File. The Departments also propose to 
add two new paragraphs, (b)(2)(iv) and 
(b)(3)(iii), to help users more easily 
locate the public disclosures made 
pursuant to these proposed rules by 
requiring plans and issuers to post a 
plain text file in a .txt format (Text File) 
in the root folder of the plan or issuer’s 
website and a specific internet domain 
as a link in the footer on the home page 
of the plan’s or issuer’s website. The 
Departments are also considering a 
standardized file format for all machine- 
readable files. The Departments also 
propose to amend the required 
information at redesignated paragraph 
(b)(1)(i)(B) and paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) to 
remove the requirement to report a 
specific number of digits of the Health 
Insurance Oversight System (HIOS) 
identifier (ID) that are required for each 
coverage option and to add a 
requirement to disclose the product type 
associated with the plan or policy in the 
In-network Rate Files and the Allowed 
Amount Files. The Departments also 
propose to amend the special rules to 
prevent unnecessary duplication in 
current paragraph (b)(4) by 
redesignating paragraph (b)(4)(i) as 
paragraph (b)(5)(i), redesignating 
paragraph (b)(4)(ii) as paragraph 
(b)(5)(ii), redesignating paragraph 
(b)(4)(iii) as paragraph (b)(5)(iv), and 
adding paragraph (b)(5)(iii). In new 
paragraph (b)(5)(iii), the Departments 
propose to permit self-insured group 
health plans under certain 
circumstances to allow another party, 
such as a service provider, with which 
they have an agreement as described in 
paragraph (b)(5)(ii), to make available in 
a single In-network Rate File as required 
under paragraph (b)(1)(i), the 
information required under paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) for more than one plan, 
insurance policy, or contract (including 
those offered by different plan sponsors 
with which the other party has an 
agreement) and across different health 
insurance markets. The Departments 
also propose to amend newly 
redesignated paragraph (b)(5)(iv) to 
permit self-insured group health plans 
under certain circumstances to allow 
another party with which they have an 
agreement to aggregate the Allowed 
Amount Files required under paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) for more than one self-insured 
group health plan, including those 
offered by different plan sponsors. 
Finally, the Departments propose to 
amend newly redesignated paragraph 
(b)(4) by adding new paragraphs to 
specify the timing requirements for each 
machine-readable file required as 
proposed under these rules. As related 
to the public disclosures generally, 
proposed paragraph (b)(4)(i) would 
amend the required reporting frequency 
for the In-network Rate and Allowed 
Amount Files under paragraphs (b)(1)(i) 
and (b)(1)(ii) from monthly to quarterly 
but would not propose any changes to 
the monthly reporting frequency for the 
prescription drug file required under 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii). Newly redesignated 
paragraph (b)(4)(vi) proposes to require 
the Text File proposed under new 
paragraph (b)(2)(iv) to be posted 
beginning on the first day of the 
calendar-year quarter following the 
applicability date under paragraph (c)(1) 
and updated and posted as soon as 
practicable but no later than 7 calendar 
days following a change in any of the 
information required under 
redesignated paragraph b)(2)(iv). 
The amendments contained in these 
proposed rules generally modify 
requirements related to the In-network 
Rate Files and the Allowed Amount 
Files. However, several proposed 
amendments would amend 
requirements related to the prescription 
drug machine-readable files, 
specifically: the requirement that plans 
and issuers must include a Text File in 
the root folder of a plan’s or issuer’s 
website as described in proposed 
paragraphs (b)(2)(iv) (section III.C.7.d. of 
this preamble) and the requirements 
related to the method and format for 
disclosing information to the public as 
described in proposed redesignated 
paragraph (b)(3) (section III.C.9. of this 
preamble). The Departments note in 
each applicable section when a proposal 
would modify requirements related to 
the prescription drug machine-readable 
files. 
4. Public Disclosure of In-Network Rates 
With respect to the disclosure of in- 
network rates specifically, to reduce 
duplicate in-network rate data, the 
Departments propose to amend 26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A3(b)(1)(i), 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A3(b)(1)(i), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(1)(i) to require plans and 
issuers to make an In-network Rate File 
available for each provider network 
maintained or contracted by the plan or 
issuer. As part of this proposal, the 
Departments propose to redesignate 
paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through (C) as 
paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(B) through (D), 
respectively, and add a new paragraph 
(b)(1)(i)(A) requiring each In-network 
Rate File to include the common 
provider network name for which 
negotiated rate information is included 
in that file. 
The Departments also propose to 
amend redesignated paragraph 
(b)(1)(i)(D)(1) to require in-network rates 
to be reflected as a dollar amount except 
for contractual arrangements under 
which plans and issuers agree to pay an 
in-network provider a percentage of 
billed charges and are not able to assign 
a dollar amount to an item or service 
prior to a bill being generated. The 
Departments also propose to add new 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E), requiring each In- 
network Rate File to include current 
enrollment totals, as of the date the file 
is posted, for each plan or coverage 
option offered by a plan or issuer that 
uses that file’s provider network. 
The Departments also propose in new 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(F) to require plans 
and issuers to exclude any provider and 
their negotiated rate (provider-rate 
combination) for an item or service, if 
the provider is unlikely to be 
reimbursed for the item or service given 
that provider’s area of specialty, 
according to the plan’s or issuer’s 
internal provider taxonomy used during 
the claims adjudication process. The 
Departments also propose to amend 
newly redesignated paragraph 
(b)(1)(i)(D)(2) to account for this 
proposed required exclusion. 
The Departments also propose to 
require plans and issuers to post several 
contextual machine-readable files under 
new paragraph (b)(2) that would help 
file users better understand the public

National Uniform Claim Committee, Health 
Care Provider Taxonomy, https://www.nucc.org/ 
index.php/code-sets-mainmenu-41/provider- 
taxonomy-mainmenu-40 (last visited Dec. 8, 2025). disclosures required in the In-network 
Rate Files under paragraph (b)(1)(i). 
This proposal would mean plans and 
issuers would be required to prepare 
new contextual files for each In-network 
Rate File prepared pursuant to these 
proposed rules. In particular, the 
Departments propose to require a 
change-log file (‘‘Change-log File’’) at 
new paragraph (b)(2)(i), which would 
identify any changes made to the 
required information described in 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) in the In-network 
Rate File since the last posted In- 
network Rate File. 
The Departments also propose to 
require a utilization file (‘‘Utilization 
File’’) at new paragraph (b)(2)(ii), which 
would document, for the 12-month 
period that ends 6 months prior to the 
publication date of each Utilization File, 
all items and services covered under the 
plans or policies represented in the In- 
network Rate File prepared pursuant to 
proposed amended paragraph (b)(1)(i) 
for which a claim has been submitted 
and reimbursed. The Utilization File 
would also include each in-network 
provider identified by the National 
Provider Identifier (NPI), Tax 
Identification Number (TIN), and Place 
of Service Code who was reimbursed, in 
whole or in part, for a claim for each 
covered item or service included in 
such file. 
The Departments also propose to 
require plans and issuers to publish a 
taxonomy file (‘‘Taxonomy File’’) at new 
paragraph (b)(2)(iii) which would 
include their internal provider 
taxonomy that matches items and 
services (represented by a billing code) 
with provider specialties (represented 
by specialty codes that are derived from 
the Health Care Provider Taxonomy
26
 
code set established by the National 
Uniform Claim Committee (NUCC)) to 
determine if the plan or issuer should 
deny reimbursement for an item or 
service because it was not furnished by 
a provider in an appropriate specialty. 
Finally, the Departments propose to 
add timing requirements for the 
proposed new contextual files under 
redesignated paragraph (b)(4). With 
respect to the contextual files that 
related to the In-network Rate Files 
under paragraph (b)(1)(i), under 
proposed paragraph (b)(4)(iii), the 
Change-log File proposed at paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) would be required to be posted 
beginning on the first day of the 
calendar-year quarter following the date 
on which the first In-network Rate File 
is required to be posted under paragraph 
(b)(4)(i), and updated and posted 
quarterly whether or not there are 
changes to that file since it was last 
posted. Under proposed paragraph 
(b)(4)(iv), the Utilization File proposed 
at paragraph (b)(2)(ii) would be required 
to be posted beginning on the first day 
of the calendar-year quarter following 
the applicability date under paragraph 
(c)(1) and updated annually after the 
initial posting. Lastly, under proposed 
paragraph (b)(4)(v), the Taxonomy File 
proposed at paragraph (b)(2)(iii) would 
be required to be posted beginning on 
the first day of the calendar-year quarter 
following the applicability date under 
paragraph (c)(1) and updated and posted 
quarterly if changes to the internal 
provider taxonomy impact the 
information required in the machine- 
readable file required under paragraph 
(b)(1)(i). 
5. Public Disclosure of Out-of-Network 
Allowed Amounts 
The Departments propose to make 
several amendments to 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(1)(ii), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(1)(ii), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(1)(ii) to increase the amount 
of historical claims data available in the 
Allowed Amount Files. These 
amendments would require plans and 
issuers to report out-of-network allowed 
amounts and billed charges at the health 
insurance market level, rather than the 
plan or policy level, lower the threshold 
for including claims in the Allowed 
Amount File from 20 to 11 different 
claims per item or service, and increase 
the reporting period from 90 days to 6 
months and the lookback period from 
180 days to 9 months. 
6. Severability 
The 2020 final rules included 
severability clauses to emphasize the 
Departments’ intent that, to the extent a 
reviewing court holds that any 
provision of the final rules is unlawful, 
the remaining rules should take effect 
and be given the maximum effect 
permitted by law. The 2020 final rules 
provide that any provision held to be 
invalid or unenforceable by its terms, or 
as applied to any person or 
circumstance, or stayed pending further 
agency action, shall be severable from 
the relevant section and shall not affect 
the remainder thereof or the application 
of the provision to persons not similarly 
situated or to dissimilar circumstances. 
The Departments are not modifying this 
language in the 2020 final rules and 
clarify that these clauses continue to 
apply and would extend to the 
amendments proposed in these rules, if 
finalized. 
7. Technical Amendments 
The Departments propose a series of 
technical amendments to the way group 
health plans and health insurance 
issuers offering group or individual 
health insurance coverage are 
referenced in 26 CFR 54.9815–2715A2 
and 54.9815–2715A3, 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A2 and 2590.715–2715A3, and 45 
CFR 147.211 and 147.212. In the 2020 
final rules, the Departments generally 
adopted the convention of referring to 
those entities using the terms ‘‘group 
health plan’’ and ‘‘health insurance 
issuer’’ throughout the regulations, 
except that where the Departments refer 
to those entities more than once in the 
same paragraph, the terms ‘‘plan’’ and 
‘‘issuer’’ are used after the initial 
instance. However, that convention was 
not applied evenly.

26 CFR 54.9815–2715A2, 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A2, and 45 CFR 147.211, 
the Departments propose technical 
amendments to paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A), 
(b)(1)(i)(B), (b)(2)(ii), (b)(3)(i), and 
(b)(3)(ii) that would bring the terms 
used to describe those entities in line 
with that convention. In the machine-

26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3, 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A3, and 45 CFR 147.212, 
the Departments propose amendments 
to redesignated paragraph (b)(1)(i)(D), 
(b)(5)(i), and (b)(5)(ii) that would bring 
the terms used to describe those entities 
in line with that convention. These 
paragraphs are otherwise unchanged. 
These proposed changes are technical in 
nature and would not affect the rights or 
obligations of any plan, issuer, or other 
entity.

II. Background 
A. Executive Orders 
On June 24, 2019, President Trump 
issued Executive Order 13877, 
‘‘Improving Price and Quality 
Transparency in American Healthcare to 
Put Patients First.’’
27
Executive Order 
13877 sought to improve transparency 
in health care and empower patients to 
make fully informed decisions about 
their health care. As Executive Order 
13877 noted, ‘‘patients often lack both 
access to useful price and quality 
information and the incentives to find 
low-cost, high-quality care.’’ The lack of 
this information is widely understood to 
be one of the root problems causing 
dysfunction within America’s health 
care system, ‘‘generally leav[ing] 
patients and taxpayers worse off than 
would a more transparent system.’’ 
Executive Order 13877 directed the 
Departments to take action that would 
combat this issue by making meaningful 
price and quality information more 
broadly available to more Americans, 
thereby increasing competition, 
innovation, and value in the health care 
system. Specifically, section 3(b) of 
Executive Order 13877 directed the 
Secretaries of the Departments to issue 
an advance notice of proposed 
rulemaking, consistent with applicable 
law, soliciting comment on a proposal 
to require health care providers, health 
insurance issuers, and self-insured 
group health plans to provide or 
facilitate access to information about 
expected out-of-pocket costs for items or 
services to patients before they receive 
care. 
To fulfill their responsibility under 
Executive Order 13877, the Departments 
proposed
28
and subsequently finalized 
the Transparency in Coverage rules in 
the 2020 final rules.
29
The 2020 final 
rules published by the Departments on 
November 12, 2020, implemented 
section 2715A of the PHS Act, which 
requires group health plans and health 
insurance issuers offering group or 
individual health insurance coverage to 
comply with section 1311(e)(3) of the 
Affordable Care Act. As described more 
fully elsewhere in this preamble, these 
provisions address transparency in 
health coverage and require plans and 
issuers to make certain information 
available to the public. 
On February 25, 2025, President 
Trump issued Executive Order 14221,
30
 
‘‘Making America Healthy Again by 
Empowering Patients With Clear, 
Accurate, and Actionable Healthcare 
Pricing Information.’’ Executive Order 
14221 stated that ‘‘[m]aking America 
healthy again will require empowering 
individuals with the best information 
possible to inform their life and 
healthcare choices’’ with the goal to 
‘‘make more meaningful price 
information available to patients to 
support a more competitive, innovative, 
affordable, and higher quality healthcare 
system.’’ To that end, the Executive 
Order directs the Departments to 
‘‘promote universal access to clear and 
accurate healthcare prices[;] . . . to 
improve existing price transparency 
requirements; increase enforcement of 
price transparency requirements; and 
identify opportunities to further 
empower patients with meaningful 
price information, potentially including 
through the expansion of existing price 
transparency requirements.’’
31
 
Section 3 of Executive Order 14221 
directs the Secretaries of the 
Departments to rapidly implement and 
enforce the health care price 
transparency regulations issued 
pursuant to Executive Order 13877,

B. Statutory Background and Enactment 
of the Affordable Care Act and the No 
Surprises Act 
The Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act (Pub. L. 111–148) was enacted 
on March 23, 2010, and the Health Care 
and Education Reconciliation Act of 
2010 (Pub. L. 111–152) was enacted on 
March 30, 2010 (collectively the 
Affordable Care Act). As relevant here, 
the Affordable Care Act reorganized, 
amended, and added to the provisions 
of part A of title XXVII of the PHS Act 
relating to health coverage requirements 
for group health plans and health 
insurance issuers. The term group 
health plan includes both insured and 
self-insured group health plans. 
The Affordable Care Act also added 
section 715 to ERISA and section 9815 
to the Code to incorporate the 
provisions of part A of title XXVII of the 
PHS Act, PHS Act sections 2701 
through 2728, into ERISA and the Code, 
making them applicable to group health 
plans and health insurance issuers 
providing coverage in connection with 
group health plans. 
Section 2715A of the PHS Act, 
incorporated into section 715 of ERISA 
and section 9815 of the Code, provides 
that plans and issuers must comply with 
section 1311(e)(3) of the Affordable Care 
Act, which addresses transparency in 
health coverage and imposes certain 
reporting and disclosure requirements 
for health plans that are seeking 
certification as QHPs that may be 
offered on an Exchange. A plan or 
coverage that is not offered through an 
Exchange (as defined by section 
1311(b)(1) of the Affordable Care Act) is 
required to submit the information 
required to the relevant Secretary and 
the relevant State’s insurance 
commissioner, and to make that 
information available to the public. 
The 2020 final rules require non- 
grandfathered health plans and health 
insurance issuers offering non- 
grandfathered group or individual 
health insurance coverage to disclose 
cost-sharing information for all covered 
items and services to participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees through an 
internet-based self-service tool or, if 
requested by the individual, on paper. 
These provisions of the 2020 final rules 
implement paragraph (C) of section 
1311(e)(3) of the Affordable Care Act. 
The 2020 final rules also require non- 
grandfathered plans and health 
insurance issuers offering non- 
grandfathered group or individual 
health insurance coverage to disclose on 
a public website three separate 
machine-readable files containing 
certain information regarding health 
care pricing under the plan or coverage. 
The machine-readable file disclosure 
requirements are intended to make 
health care pricing information 
accessible and useful to consumers and 
other interested parties (including 
employers, and other purchasers of 
health care),
35
support efforts to lower 
health care costs by driving 
competition,
36
and to supplement State 
transparency efforts.
37
These provisions 
of the 2020 final rules requiring plans 
and issuers to disclose in-network 
negotiated rates, out-of-network allowed 
amounts and the associated billed 
charges, and negotiated rates and 
historical net prices for prescription 
drugs implement paragraph (A) of 
section 1311(e)(3) of the Affordable Care 
Act. In particular, the provisions 
requiring the disclosure of out-of- 
network allowed amounts specifically 
implement the requirement in section 
1311(e)(3)(A)(vii) of the Affordable Care 
Act to provide information on 
‘‘payments with respect to any out-of- 
network coverage.’’ In addition, the 
Secretary of HHS determined that 
requiring disclosure of payment 
information on in-network rates and 
prescription drugs is appropriate under 
section 1311(e)(3)(A)(ix) of the 
Affordable Care Act. 
The No Surprises Act added new 
provisions applicable to plans and 
issuers in Subchapter B of chapter 100 
of the Code, Part 7 of ERISA, and Parts 
D and E of title XXVII of the PHS Act. 
As relevant here, the No Surprises Act 
added new sections 9816(a)–(b) and 
9817(a) of the Code, sections 716(a)–(b) 
and 717(a) of ERISA, and sections 
2799A–1, 2799A–2, 2799B–1, 2799B–2, 
2799B–3, and 2799B–5 of the PHS Act, 
which protect participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees in group 
health plans and group and individual 
health insurance coverage from balance 
bills by prohibiting nonparticipating 
providers, facilities, and providers of air 
ambulance services from billing or 
holding liable individuals for an amount 
that exceeds in-network cost sharing 
determined in accordance with the No 
Surprises Act’s cost-sharing limitations 
in circumstances where the cost-sharing 
limitations apply. The No Surprises Act 
also added new section 9816(e) of the 
Code, section 716(e) of ERISA, and 
sections 2799A–1(e) of the PHS Act, 
which contain requirements for 
applicable group health plans or issuers 
to include certain information, in clear 
writing, on any physical or electronic 
plan or insurance identification card 
issued to the participants or 
beneficiaries in the plan or coverage. 
This information includes any 
deductible applicable to such plan or 
coverage, any out-of-pocket maximum 
limitation applicable to such plan or 
coverage, and a telephone number and 
internet website address through which 
such individual may seek consumer 
assistance information. 
Further, section 114 of the No 
Surprises Act added section 2799A–4 of 
the PHS Act, section 9819 of the Code, 
and section 719 of ERISA, which require 
plans and issuers to: offer price 
comparison guidance by telephone and 
make available on the internet website 
of the plan or issuer a price comparison 
tool that (to the extent practicable) 
allows an individual enrolled under 
such plan or coverage, with respect to 
such plan year, such geographic region, 
and participating providers with respect 
to such plan or coverage, to compare the 
amount of cost sharing that the 
individual would be responsible for 
paying under such plan or coverage 
with respect to the furnishing of a 
specific item or service by any such 
provider. 
C. Statutory Background for 
Enforcement With Regards to the 
Affordable Care Act and the CAA of 
2021 
The enforcement responsibilities of 
HHS and the States with respect to 
oversight of health insurance issuer 
compliance with the Federal insurance 
market reforms are set forth in the PHS 
Act. Pursuant to section 2723(a)(1) of 
the PHS Act, as amended by the No 
Surprises Act, states have primary 
enforcement authority over health 
insurance issuers regarding the 
provisions of Parts A and D of title 
XXVII of the PHS Act. Under this 
framework, HHS has enforcement

authority over issuers in a State if the 
Secretary of HHS makes a determination 
that the State is failing to substantially 
enforce a provision (or provisions) of 
Part A or D of title XXVII of the PHS 
Act.
38
 
The Departments of Labor and the 
Treasury generally have primary 
enforcement authority over private 
sector employment-based group health 
plans. The Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) has jurisdiction over certain 
church plans. HHS also has primary 
enforcement authority over non-Federal 
governmental plans, such as those 
sponsored by state and local 
government employers.
39
 
The Departments will generally use 
existing processes to ensure compliance 
with the Code, ERISA, and PHS Act 
requirements that apply to group health 
plans and health insurance issuers. 
HHS’s enforcement procedures related 
to the PHS Act Federal insurance 
market reforms are set forth in section 
2723 of the PHS Act and 45 CFR 
150.101 et seq., including bases for initiating investigations, performing 
market conduct examinations, and 
imposing civil money penalties. Section 
504 of ERISA provides DOL with 
investigatory authority to determine 
whether any person has violated or is 
about to violate any provision of ERISA 
or any regulation or order thereunder. 
D. Consultation With and Input From 
Interested Parties 
The Departments have been in regular 
consultation with interested parties 
since publishing the 2019 proposed 
rules. In addition to the thousands of 
comments received on the 2019 
proposed rules, following the 
publication of the 2020 final rules, the 
Departments continued to engage in 
consultation with interested parties and 
collaboration about implementation of 
the 2020 final rules through technical 
implementation discussions on GitHub 
(an online hosting platform for 
development and source code 
management that permits version 
control), webinars, emails, and an 
inquiry management system, as well as 
other informal compliance assistance 
efforts and meetings with interested 
parties. This period of collaboration 
with interested parties led to the 
finalization of an initial technical format 
for disclosures (Schema 1.0) that was 
finalized on March 1, 2022, and became 
applicable on July 1, 2022. The 
Departments also regularly review news 
articles and research publications 
discussing the 2020 final rules and have 
received written and verbal 
recommendations from plans and 
issuers, data engineers, and researchers 
and academics.
40
 
On May 22, 2025, the Departments 
released FAQs Part 70 on Schema 2.0, 
which states the Departments’ intention

FAQs Part 70 
requested interested parties to provide 
feedback through GitHub on how best to 
address the revised technical reporting 
requirements. These improvements 
respond to feedback from interested 
parties and are designed to reduce 
unnecessary or duplicative data fields 
and make cost information easier for 
consumers to understand and use. 
Additionally, on June 2, 2025, the 
Departments issued an RFI
42
regarding 
the prescription drug machine-readable 
file requirement seeking comment and 
recommendations on the prescription 
drug price disclosure requirements. 
More specifically, the RFI requested 
comments and recommendations to 
help inform implementation of the 
prescription drug file disclosure 
requirements, including information on 
existing prescription drug file data 
elements, the ability of health plans to 
access necessary data for reporting, as 
well as state approaches and 
innovation.
43
 
The Departments considered all 
public input received as they developed 
the policies in these proposed rules, 
with the exception of prescription drug 
RFI comments. However, the 
Departments received these prescription 
drug RFI comments and are separately 
taking them into consideration to 
evaluate how to implement the 
Transparency in Coverage prescription 
drug disclosure requirements in 
technical implementation guidance or 
future rulemaking. 
III. Provisions of the Proposed 
Regulations 
A. Definitions 
The Departments propose to define 
the term health insurance market for 
purposes of proposed amendments to 
the Allowed Amount File provision at 
26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(1)(ii), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(1)(ii), and 45 
CFR 147.212(b)(1)(ii) (discussed in more 
detail in section III.C.6. of this 
preamble), which would require group 
health plans and health insurance 
issuers offering group or individual 
health insurance coverage to make an 
out-of-network allowed amount 
machine-readable file available for each 
health insurance market in which plans 
and issuers offer a plan or coverage. 
Establishing a standardized definition of 
the term health insurance market for 
this purpose would promote consistent 
data organization across plans and 
issuers in these market-level Allowed 
Amount Files. 
The Departments propose to 
redesignate paragraphs (a)(2)(xi) through 
(xxii) as paragraphs (a)(2)(xii) through 
(xxiii) under 26 CFR 54.9815–2715A1 
and 45 CFR 147.210, respectively, and 
add a new paragraph (a)(2)(xi) with the 
new definition. The Departments also 
propose to redesignate paragraphs 
(a)(2)(x) through (xxi) as paragraphs 
(a)(2)(xi) through (xxii) under 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A1, and to add a 
new paragraph (a)(2)(x) with the new 
definition. Under this proposal, health 
insurance market would mean, 
irrespective of the State, one of the 
following: 
€The individual market, as defined in 45 CFR 144.103 (other than short- 
term, limited-duration insurance or 
individual health insurance coverage 
that consists solely of excepted 
benefits). 
€The large group market, as defined in 45 CFR 144.103 (other than coverage 
that consists solely of excepted 
benefits). 
€The small group market, as defined in 45 CFR 144.103 (other than coverage 
that consists solely of excepted 
benefits). 
€For purposes of self-insured group health plans (other than account-based 
plans, as defined in 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2711(d)(6)(i), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2711(d)(6)(i), and 45 CFR 
147.126(d)(6)(i), and plans that consist 
solely of excepted benefits), all self- 
insured group health plans maintained 
by the plan sponsor. 
For consistency, this definition would 
largely align with the definition of the 
term ‘‘insurance market’’ for the 
purposes of the methodology for 
calculating the qualifying payment 
amount (QPA) at 26 CFR 54.9816– 
6(a)(8), 29 CFR 2590.716–6(a)(8), and 45 
CFR 149.140(a)(8). As background, Code 
section 9816(a)(3)(E), ERISA section 
716(a)(3)(E), and PHS Act 2799A– 
1(a)(3)(E), as added by section 103 of the

6T(a)(8)(iv), 29 CFR 2590.716–6(a)(8)(iv), and 45 
CFR 149.140(a)(8)(iv). The Department of Justice 
did not appeal the vacatur of this specific provision 
and it remains in place. See also FAQs About 
Affordable Care Act and Consolidated Act, 2021

85 FR 72158, 72201 (November 12, 2020). 
No Surprises Act, generally defines the 
QPA as ‘‘the median of the contracted 
rates recognized by the plan or issuer, 
respectively (determined with respect to 
all such plans of such sponsor or all 
such coverage offered by such issuer 
that are offered within the same 
insurance market (specified in 
subclause (I), (II), (III), or (IV) of clause 
(iv)) as the plan or coverage) . . . under 
such plans or coverage, respectively, on 
January 31, 2019,’’ subject to other 
criteria and increased for inflation. 
Paragraph (a)(3)(E)(iv)(III) of the Code 
and ERISA and paragraph 
(a)(3)(E)(iv)(IV) of the PHS Act, provide 
that in the case of a self-insured group 
health plan, a health insurance market 
is ‘‘other self-insured group health 
plans.’’ 
When interpreting the definition of 
QPA for purposes of establishing a 
methodology for calculating the QPA, 
the Departments defined ‘‘insurance 
market’’ with respect to self-insured 
group health plans to include, ‘‘at the 
option of the plan sponsor, all self- 
insured group health plans 
administered by the same entity 
(including a third party administrator 
(TPA) contracted by the plan), to the 
extent otherwise permitted by law, that 
is responsible for calculating the 
qualifying payment amount on behalf of 
the plan.’’
44
In other words, the interim 
final rules permitted plan sponsors to 
use either rates from only their own 
plans or rates from all plans 
administered by their TPA to calculate 
QPAs. However, this language has been 
vacated by the United States District 
Court for the Eastern District of Texas 
on the basis that the No Surprises Act 
specifies that QPAs must be calculated 
using the rates of ‘‘all such plans of such 
sponsor.’’
45
Therefore, the United States 
District Court for the Eastern District of 
Texas interpreted the No Surprises Act 
to restrict aggregation in that manner for 
the purpose of calculating the QPA. 
In contrast, the language of PHS Act 
section 2715A neither requires nor 
prohibits disclosure of information 
described in the Affordable Care Act 
section 1311(e)(3) to be aggregated by 
any specific market. Therefore, in order 
to avoid confusion between the 
insurance market applicable to the 
Allowed Amount File and the insurance 
market applicable to the definition of 
QPA, which is subject to the holding of 
TMA III, the Departments propose to use 
the term ‘‘health insurance market,’’ 
rather than ‘‘insurance market,’’ for 
purposes of organizing the Allowed 
Amount File. The Departments note that 
to the extent self-insured group health 
plans use an entity to administer the 
plan, the aggregation rules described in 
proposed 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(5)(iv), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(5)(iv), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(5)(iv) would allow the entity 
to aggregate out-of-network allowed 
amounts for more than one plan offered 
by a self-insured group health plan 
sponsor the entity administers, 
including those offered by self-insured 
group health plan sponsors. For clarity, 
the Departments also propose to include 
cross-references to the market-wide 
definitions in 45 CFR 144.103 where 
applicable. 
The Departments understand that the 
term health insurance market is not 
generally used to refer to self-insured 
group health plans. However, for 
purposes of uniformity in the definition, 
to facilitate a more streamlined and 
uniformed disclosure of Allowed 
Amount File, and for ease of reference, 
the Departments propose that for 
purposes of self-insured group health 
plans (other than account-based plans, 
as defined in 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2711(d)(6)(i), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2711(d)(6)(i), and 45 CFR 
147.126(d)(6)(i) of this subchapter, and 
plans that consist solely of excepted 
benefits), health insurance market 
would mean all self-insured group 
health plans maintained by the plan 
sponsor. 
The Departments seek comment on 
this proposed definition. 
B. Requirements for Disclosing Cost- 
Sharing Information to Participants, 
Beneficiaries, and Enrollees 
1. Disclaimer on Balance Billing 
The Departments propose to amend 
the balance billing protection notice that 
plans and issuers are currently required 
to include along with the required cost- 
sharing information to participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees under 26 
CFR 54.9815–2715A2(b)(1)(vii)(A), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A2(b)(1)(vii)(A), and 
45 CFR 147.211(b)(1)(vii)(A). These 
proposed amendments would require a 
statement that the cost-sharing 
information in the self-service tool does 
not account for potential additional 
amounts in situations where applicable 
State and Federal law allow out-of- 
network providers to bill participants, 
beneficiaries, or enrollees for the 
difference between a provider’s billed 
charges and the sum of the amount 
collected from the plan or issuer and the 
amount collected from the participant, 
beneficiary, or enrollee in the form of a 
copayment, coinsurance, or deductible 
amount (the difference referred to as 
balance billing). These changes are 
being proposed to reflect the existence 
of the Federal balance billing 
protections set forth in the No Surprises 
Act, which were not yet enacted when 
the current disclaimer language was 
finalized in the 2020 final rules. This 
statement would not be required if the 
State in which the item or service was 
furnished prohibits all out-of-network 
providers from balance billing for all 
items and services payable by the group 
health plan or health insurance issuer. 
Currently, under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, plans and issuers must 
disclose certain cost-sharing 
information to participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees, including, 
under paragraph (b)(1)(i), an estimate of 
the participant’s, beneficiary’s, or 
enrollee’s cost-sharing liability for a 
requested covered item or service from 
a particular provider or providers. 
Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) requires, in part, 
that if the request is for cost-sharing 
information for an out-of-network 
provider, the plan or issuer must 
disclose an out-of-network allowed 
amount or any other rate that the group 
health plan or health insurance issuer 
will pay for the requested covered item 
or service. As discussed in the 2020 
final rules,
46
because cost estimates 
cannot account for potential balance 
billing by an out-of-network provider, 
current rules under paragraph (b)(1)(vii) 
require plans and issuers to include a 
notice with a number of statements, 
including, under paragraph 
(b)(1)(vii)(A), that out-of-network 
providers may bill participants, 
beneficiaries, or enrollees for the 
difference between a provider’s billed 
charges and the sum of the amount 
collected from the plan or issuer and the 
amount collected from the participant, 
beneficiary, or enrollee in the form of a

U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Department of 
Health & Human Services & U.S. Department of the 
Treasury, FAQs about Affordable Care Act and Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 
Implementation Part 49 (August 20, 2021), https:// 
www.cms.gov/cciio/resources/fact-sheets-and-faqs/ 
downloads/faqs-part-49.pdf and https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/EBSA/about-ebsa/

copayment or coinsurance amount (the 
difference often referred to as balance 
billing) and that these estimates do not 
account for those potential additional 
amounts. Because there were existing 
State laws prohibiting balance billing to 
some extent, as discussed in the 2020 
final rules,
47
the current rules only 
require this statement if balance billing 
is permitted under State law. 
Shortly after the 2020 final rules were 
published, the CAA, 2021, which 
included the No Surprises Act, was 
signed into law on December 27, 2020. 
The No Surprises Act added provisions 
that apply to group health plans and 
health insurance issuers offering group 
or individual health insurance coverage, 
including certain limitations on cost 
sharing for emergency services and for 
non-emergency services provided by 
nonparticipating providers with respect 
to visits to certain participating health 
care facilities.
48
The No Surprises Act 
also added certain limitations on cost 
sharing for air ambulance services 
provided by out-of-network air 
ambulance providers.
49
Additionally, 
the No Surprises Act added that cost- 
sharing payments for emergency 
services, non-emergency services 
furnished by a nonparticipating 
provider in a participating health care 
facility, and air ambulance services 
furnished by a nonparticipating 
provider must be counted toward any 
in-network deductible or out-of-pocket 
maximums applied under the plan or 
coverage (including the annual 
limitation on cost sharing under section 
2707(b) of the PHS Act) (as applicable), 
respectively (and these in-network 
deductibles and out-of-pocket 
maximums must be applied) in the same 
manner as if such cost-sharing payments 
were made with respect to services 
furnished by a participating provider or 
facility.
50
 
In addition to the new provisions 
applicable to plans and issuers, the No 
Surprises Act added a new Part E to title 
XXVII of the PHS Act establishing 
requirements applicable to health care 
providers, facilities, and providers of air 
ambulance services. Specifically, the No 
Surprises Act added new PHS Act 
sections 2799B–1, 2799B–2, 2799B–3, 
and 2799B–5, which protect 
participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees 
in group health plans and group and 
individual health insurance coverage 
offered by health insurance issuers from 
balance bills by generally prohibiting 
nonparticipating providers, facilities, 
and providers of air ambulance services 
from billing or holding liable 
individuals for an amount that exceeds 
in-network cost sharing determined in 
accordance with the No Surprises Act’s 
cost-sharing limitations in 
circumstances where the cost-sharing 
limitations apply. 
Given that after the passage of the No 
Surprises Act, all participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees of group 
health plans and group and individual 
health insurance coverage are now 
protected from certain balance billing 
under Federal law, the Departments 
propose to amend the balance billing 
protection notice provision under 
paragraph (b)(1)(vii)(A) to require a 
statement that the cost-sharing 
information provided pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) does not account for 
potential additional amounts in 
situations where applicable State and 
Federal law allow out-of-network 
providers to bill participants, 
beneficiaries, or enrollees, for the 
difference between a provider’s billed 
charges and the sum of the amount 
collected from the plan or issuer and 
from the participant, beneficiary, or 
enrollee in the form of a copayment, 
coinsurance, or deductible amount (the 
difference referred to as balance billing). 
Because there are circumstances under 
which participants, beneficiaries, and 
enrollees can be balance billed under 
current Federal law and State balance 
billing laws, the Departments propose to 
clarify that this disclaimer is not 
required only if the State in which the 
item or service is to be furnished 
prohibits all out-of-network providers 
from balance billing for all items and 
services payable by the group health 
plan or health insurance issuer. 
The Departments understand that no 
States currently categorically prohibit 
balance billing under all circumstances. 
Therefore, requiring plans and issuers in 
States without such categorical 
prohibitions to include this disclaimer 
would provide an additional layer of 
transparency for consumers. It would 
also maintain flexibility for plans and 
issuers to not include the notice if the 
State in which the plan or issuer is 
disclosing cost-sharing information to a 
participant, beneficiary, or enrollee 
does, subsequent to the finalization of 
these proposed rules, pass a law to 
which all providers are subject that 
prohibits balance billing for all items 
and services payable by the plan or 
issuer. 
The Departments seek comment on 
this proposal. 
2. New Required Method and Format for 
Disclosing Information to Participants, 
Beneficiaries, or Enrollees 
The Departments propose to add new 
26 CFR 54.9815–2715A2(b)(2)(iii), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A2(b)(2)(iii), and 45 
CFR 147.211(b)(2)(iii) to require plans 
and issuers to make available to 
participants, beneficiaries, and 
enrollees, at their request, the cost- 
sharing estimates and other disclosures 
required under 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A2(b)(1), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A2(b)(1), and 45 CFR 147.211(b)(1) 
via a phone number. Under this 
proposal, the information required via a 
phone number would be required to be 
accurate at the time of the request and 
provided at the time of the request. 
Plans and issuers would be required to 
use the same telephone number that 
Code section 9816(e), ERISA section 
716(e), and PHS Act section 2799A–1(e), 
as added by section 107 of the No 
Surprises Act,
51
require be indicated on 
any physical or electronic plan or 
insurance identification (ID) card issued 
to participants, beneficiaries, and 
enrollees for obtaining customer 
assistance. The Departments also 
propose to redesignate paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii)(D) as new paragraph (b)(2)(iv) 
and amend paragraph (b)(2)(iv) to 
remove phone as an example of an 
alternative means for providing the 
disclosures by which a participant, 
beneficiary, or enrollee may request the 
disclosures required described in 
paragraph (b)(1) because providing the 
disclosures by a phone number would 
be required, as specified previously. If 
this new requirement is finalized as 
proposed, plans and issuers would be 
required to make available cost-sharing 
estimates via the internet-based self- 
service tool, a phone number, and paper 
upon request. 
The 2020 final rules at paragraph 
(b)(2) allow plans and issuers to satisfy 
the disclosure requirements of 
paragraph (b)(1) through a self-service 
tool, via paper, or through an alternative 
means such as phone or email, provided 
the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee 
agrees that disclosure through such 
means is sufficient to satisfy the request 
and the request is fulfilled at least as 
rapidly as required for the paper 
method. However, disclosure by such 
alternative means is not required.

U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Department of 
Health & Human Services & U.S. Department of the 
Treasury, FAQs About Affordable Care Act and Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 
Implementation Part 49 (Aug. 20, 2021), https://
www.cms.gov/cciio/resources/fact-sheets-and-faqs/ 
downloads/faqs-part-49.pdf and https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/EBSA/about-ebsa/ 
our-activities/resource-center/faqs/aca-part-49.pdf. 
FAQ Part 49 provided that, pending any 
implementing rulemaking, the Departments would 
not deem a plan or issuer to be out of compliance 
with ID card requirements where a plan or issuer 
includes on any ID card, among other things, a 
telephone number and website address for 
individuals to seek consumer assistance and access 
additional applicable deductibles and maximum 
out-of-pocket limits. 
While the Departments have 
determined that the No Surprises Act’s 
price comparison tool (codified at Code 
section 9819, ERISA section 719, and 
the PHS Act section 2799A–4) and self- 
service tool required under the 2020 
final rules are largely duplicative, as 
discussed in more detail in section 
III.B.3. of this preamble, the 
requirements of Code section 9819, 
ERISA section 719, and the PHS Act 
section 2799A–4 expand the 
requirements for the disclosure of cost- 
sharing information in the 2020 final 
rules in one prominent way. 
Specifically, Code section 9819, ERISA 
section 719, and the PHS Act section 
2799A–4 require group health plans and 
health insurance issuers offering group 
or individual health insurance coverage 
to ‘‘offer price comparison guidance by 
telephone.’’ 
The Departments intend for these 
proposed rules to satisfy the 
requirements of the No Surprises Act to 
require price comparison guidance via a 
telephone number, as set forth in Code 
section 9819, ERISA section 719, and 
PHS Act section 2799A–4. Further, 
implementing this requirement would 
respond to feedback the Departments 
have received from participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees since the 
publication of the 2020 final rules, 
indicating a limited ability to receive 
cost-sharing information over the phone 
when requested from plans and issuers. 
Requiring plans and issuers to provide 
cost-sharing information in this way 
would further promote the price 
transparency goals of providing 
accurate, real-time pricing to 
consumers, and making that information 
accessible to more consumers. 
To achieve these goals, these 
proposed rules add paragraph (b)(2)(iii), 
proposing to require plans and issuers 
to make available to participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees the cost- 
sharing estimates and other disclosures 
required under paragraph (b)(1), via 
phone, at the time requested and 
accurate at the time of their request. 
In addition, at paragraph (b)(2)(iii), 
the Departments propose to allow plans 
and issuers to limit the number of 
providers with respect to which cost- 
sharing information for covered items 
and services is provided to no fewer 
than 20 providers per day and, to 
require plans and issuers to disclose the 
applicable provider-per-day limit to the 
participant, beneficiary, or enrollee 
when the request for information is 
made. A similar 20 provider limit 
currently applies with respect to paper 
requests at 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A2(b)(2)(ii), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A2(b)(2)(ii), and 45 CFR 
147.211(b)(2)(ii). In the 2020 final rules, 
the Departments determined based on 
comments that ‘‘limiting paper request 
to 20 providers per request is a 
reasonable approach to balancing the 
burdens on plans and issuers with the 
benefits of providing consumers with 
enough information to be able to 
compare cost and provider options.’’
52
 
The Departments have determined that 
the process by which plans and issuers 
would generate information responsive 
to requests for receiving cost-sharing 
information over the phone should be 
similar to the process for generating 
such information to deliver via paper, 
given the practicalities of generating a 
response on paper and over the phone. 
Therefore, the Departments propose to 
adopt the limitations for paper 
disclosure at 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A2(b)(2)(ii), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A2(b)(2)(ii), and 45 CFR 
147.211(b)(2)(ii) for phone disclosure 
such that plans and issuers may limit 
the number of providers with respect to 
which cost-sharing information for 
covered items and services is provided 
to no fewer than 20 providers per day 
and, plans and issuers would be 
required to disclose the applicable 
provider-per-day limit to the 
participant, beneficiary, or enrollee 
when the request for information is 
made. This proposal is intended to 
balance the added burden to plans and 
issuers of this additional method of 
delivery with ensuring that participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees that opt to 
receive cost-sharing information over 
the phone have access to the same 
information as those that request such 
information via the paper method. The 
Departments note that nothing in these 
proposed rules precludes a participant, 
beneficiary, or enrollee from obtaining 
cost-sharing information from more than 
one method, consistent with the 
requirements for each method. 
Similarly, for consistency with the 
requirements for the paper method of 
delivery under the 2020 final rules, the 
Departments also propose to require 
plans and issuers to satisfy requests for 
cost-sharing information over the phone 
at the time of the phone call in order to 
ensure that participants, beneficiaries, 
and enrollees receive information as 
quickly as possible. 
Accordingly, the Departments 
propose to require plans and issuers to 
make available to participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees the cost- 
sharing estimates and other disclosures 
described in paragraph (b)(1) via phone 
at the time of the request and accurate 
at the time of the request, and in 
accordance with the method and format 
requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) 
through (C). 
The Departments are also proposing 
to require health plans and health 
insurance issuers to make cost-sharing 
estimates and other disclosures 
available over the phone at a number 
designated on the ID card for 
individuals to seek assistance. Code 
section 9816(e), ERISA section 716(e), 
and PHS Act section 2799A–1(e) 
(insurance ID card requirements), as 
added by section 107 of the No 
Surprises Act, separately require plans 
and issuers to include in clear writing, 
on any physical or electronic plan or 
insurance identification card issued to 
participants, beneficiaries, or enrollees, 
certain information including a phone 
number and website address for 
individuals to seek consumer assistance. 
Therefore, plans and issuers are already 
required to have a phone number 
designated on any physical or electronic 
plan or insurance identification card 
and, under this proposal, plans and 
issuers should make available cost- 
sharing estimates and other disclosures 
at the request of the participant or 
beneficiary via such phone number, if 
finalized. These provisions apply with 
respect to plan years (in the individual 
market, policy years) beginning on or 
after January 1, 2022.
53
The 
Departments expect that requiring plans 
and issuers to use an existing phone 
number would allow them to leverage 
existing workflows and would make it 
easier for participants, beneficiaries, and 
enrollees to obtain the cost information 
they are seeking. 
The Departments request comment on 
whether this proposal should include 
phone service standards to ensure that 
consumers have access to timely and 
reliable information. In particular, the 
Departments request comment on what 
such standards should include and what 
parameters should be applied to each 
criterion. The Departments also request 
comment on whether there are other 
relevant Federal, State, or local

any industry practices that the 
Departments should consider. 
3. Compliance With PHS Act Section 
2799A–4, ERISA Section 719, and Code 
Section 9819 
The Departments propose to add new 
26 CFR 54.9815–2715A2(c)(7), 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A2(c)(7), and 45 CFR 
147.211(c)(7) stating that a plan or 
issuer satisfies the requirements of Code 
section 9819, ERISA section 719, and 
the PHS Act section 2799A–4, as added 
by section 114 of the No Surprises Act 
by providing the information required 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to 
participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees 
in accordance with the method and 
format requirements specified in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. 
The 2020 final rules added 26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A2(b)(1) and (b)(2), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A2(b)(1) and (b)(2), 
and 45 CFR 147.211(b)(1) and (b)(2), 
which created a comprehensive set of 
requirements for plan and issuer 
disclosure of cost-sharing information 
through an internet-based self-service 
tool, and in paper form, upon request.
54
 
Paragraph (b)(1) of the 2020 final rules 
requires the disclosure of cost-sharing 
information, which is accurate at the 
time the request is made, with respect 
to a participant’s, beneficiary’s, or 
enrollee’s cost-sharing liability for 
covered items and services, and which 
must reflect any cost-sharing reductions 
the enrollee would receive. 
Under paragraph (b)(2) of the 2020 
final rules, disclosures must be made 
available through a self-service tool on 
an internet website that provides real- 
time responses based on cost-sharing 
information that is accurate at the time 
of the request, in plain language, 
without a fee, or in paper form, at the 
user’s request. This paragraph requires 
certain functionality to make searching 
using the self-service tool easier, 
including searching by billing code or 
descriptive term, and refining and 
reordering search results based on 
geographic proximity of in-network 
providers, and the amount of the 
participant’s, beneficiary’s, or enrollee’s 
estimated cost-sharing liability for the 
covered item or service, to the extent the 
search for cost-sharing information for 
covered items or services returns 
multiple results.
55
 
Code section 9819, ERISA section 
719, and PHS Act section 2799A–4, as 
added by section 114 of the No 
Surprises Act, require plans and issuers 
to offer price comparison guidance by 
telephone and make available on the 
plan’s or issuer’s website a ‘‘price 
comparison tool’’ that allows 
individuals enrolled under such plan or 
coverage offered by the plan or issuer to 
compare the amount of cost sharing that 
the individual would be responsible for 
paying for an item or service furnished 
by an in-network provider (hereinafter 
‘‘No Surprises Act price comparison 
tool’’). This requirement was applicable 
with respect to plan years (and in the 
individual market, policy years) 
beginning on or after January 1, 2022. 
The Departments announced on 
August 20, 2021, in FAQs Part 49 that 
the price comparison methods required 
by the No Surprises Act price 
comparison tool are largely duplicative 
of the self-service tool component of the 
2020 final rules except that the 
information under the No Surprises Act 
price comparison tool must also be 
provided over the telephone upon 
request.
56
Therefore, the Departments 
indicated they intended to propose 
rulemaking requiring that the same 
pricing information that is available 
through the self-service tool or in paper 
form, as described in the 2020 final 
rules, must also be provided over the 
phone upon request. The Departments 
also announced that, as an exercise of 
enforcement discretion, they would 
defer enforcement of the requirement 
that plans and issuers make available a 
price comparison tool by internet 
website, in paper form, or telephone 
pursuant to the No Surprises Act until 
plan years (or in the individual market, 
policy years) beginning on or after 
January 1, 2023, to align the 
enforcement date of the No Surprises 
Act price comparison disclosure 
requirements with the enforcement date 
of the self-service tool described in the 
2020 final rules. 
Further, the Departments announced 
their intention to propose rulemaking 
and seek public comment regarding 
whether compliance with the self- 
service tool requirements of the 2020 
final rules should satisfy the analogous 
requirements set forth Code section 
9819, ERISA section 719, and PHS Act 
section 2799A–4. Plans and issuers have 
built and developed tools to comply 
with the requirements of the 2020 final 
rules and have anticipated, since the 
release of FAQs Part 49, that the 
Departments would propose in a future 
rulemaking that plans and issuers 
satisfy the No Surprises Act price 
comparison tool requirement by 
providing the required disclosures to 
participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees 
through the self-service tool as required 
in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of the 2020 
final rules. Given this, the Departments 
have determined that requiring plans 
and issuers to build a second self- 
service tool would impose significant 
unnecessary burden and cause 
considerable confusion for consumers 
on the purposes of the two tools. Thus, 
it is appropriate that compliance with 
the self-service tool described in the 
2020 final rules and as amended in 
these proposed rules should satisfy 
compliance with the No Surprises Act 
price comparison tool requirements. 
Therefore, as discussed in section 
II.B.2. of this preamble, to align with the 
No Surprises Act price comparison tool 
requirements the Departments propose 
to require in new paragraph (b)(2)(iii) 
that plans and issuers make available to 
participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees 
the cost-sharing information and other 
disclosures required under paragraph 
(b)(1) via the same telephone number 
that Code section 9816(e), ERISA 
section 716(e), and PHS Act section 
2799A–1(e), as added by section 107 of 
the No Surprises Act, requires be 
indicated on any physical or electronic 
plan or insurance identification card 
issued to a participant, beneficiary, or 
enrollee for obtaining customer 
assistance. The Departments also 
propose at new paragraph (c)(7) that a 
group plan or health insurance issuer 
satisfies the requirements of Code 
section 9819, ERISA section 719, and 
PHS Act section 2799A–4 by providing 
the information required in paragraph 
(b)(1) to participants, beneficiaries, and 
enrollees in accordance with the 
method and format requirements 
specified in paragraph (b)(2). 
The Departments acknowledge that, 
while PHS Act section 2715A does not 
apply to grandfathered health plans and 
health insurance issuers offering 
grandfathered individual and group 
health insurance coverage, Code section 
9819, ERISA section 719, and PHS Act 
section 2799A–4 do. The Departments 
have also stated that the requirements of 
PHS Act section 2715A are largely 
duplicative to those of Code section 
9819, ERISA section 719, and PHS Act 
section 2799A–4, except that the former 
does not require information to be 
disclosed by phone. Therefore, if this 
rule is finalized, grandfathered health 
plans and issuers offering grandfathered

Continued 
health insurance coverage may comply 
with the requirements of PHS Act 
2715A, as codified in 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A2, 29 CFR 2590.716–2715A2 and 
45 CFR 147.211, to satisfy the 
requirements of Code section 9819, 
ERISA section 719, and PHS Act section 
2799A–4. The Departments request 
comments on whether any additional 
provisions are necessary to assist 
grandfathered health plans and health 
insurance issuers in complying with the 
requirements of 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A2, 29 CFR 2590.716–2715A2 and 
45 CFR 147.211. The Departments seek 
comment on all aspects of this proposal. 
4. Applicability 
The Departments propose to revise 26 
CFR 54.9815–2715A2(c)(1), 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A2(c)(1), and 45 CFR 
147.211(c)(1) to state that the proposed 
amendments to (b)(1)(vii)(A), and new 
paragraphs (b)(2)(iii), (b)(2)(iv), and 
(c)(7) of this section would apply for 
plan years (in the individual market, 
policy years) beginning on or after 
January 1, 2027. Until such time, the 
current provisions of paragraph (b) of 
this section continue to apply. 
With respect to proposed provisions 
at new paragraph (b)(2)(iii), the 
Departments understand that most plans 
and issuers already have in place a 
consumer assistance telephone number 
for participants, beneficiaries, and 
enrollees to receive benefit information 
pursuant to Code section 9816(e), ERISA 
section 716(e), and PHS Act section 
2799A–1(e), as added by section 107 of 
the No Surprises Act, and as clarified in 
previously issued guidance.
57
Because 
plans and issuers can leverage the 
operations of an existing consumer 
assistance phone number, the 
Departments have determined that the 
proposed applicability date 
appropriately balances the need for 
improved access to cost-sharing 
estimates for consumers who wish to 
access this information over the phone 
with the time necessary for plans and 
issuers to make the administrative and 
operational changes to implement this 
proposal. Similarly, because most plans 
are already required to disclose the 
balance billing disclosures under the 
2020 final rules, the Departments have 
determined that the proposed 
applicability date for new paragraph 
(b)(1)(vii)(A) that would amend the 
balance billing disclosure is appropriate 
and reasonable. 
The Departments propose to make 
new paragraph (c)(7) applicable for plan 
years (in the individual market, policy 
years) beginning on or after January 1, 
2027. The Departments selected this 
date because once plans and issuers are 
required to provide cost-sharing 
information by phone on the same date 
pursuant to proposed new paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii), it would be reasonable for the 
Departments to consider a plan or 
issuer’s compliance with paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (2) to constitute compliance 
with the No Surprises Act price 
comparison tool as required by Code 
section 9819, ERISA section 719, and 
PHS Act section 2799A–4. 
The Departments seek comment on 
this proposed applicability date for 
these proposed provisions. 
C. Requirements for Public Disclosure of 
In-Network Rates and Historical 
Allowed Amount Data for Covered Items 
and Services From In- and Out-of- 
Network Providers 
1. Provider Network-Level Reporting for 
the In-Network Rate Files 
The current In-network Rate File 
provision at 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(1)(i), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(1)(i), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(1)(i) requires plans and 
issuers to make available on a public 
website a machine-readable file that 
discloses in-network provider rates for 
covered items and services, with the 
exception of prescription drugs that are 
subject to a fee-for-service 
reimbursement arrangement. The 
Departments propose to amend the 
introductory language of paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) to require plans and issuers to 
make available an In-network Rate File 
for each provider network maintained or 
contracted by the group health plan or 
health insurance issuer. This proposed 
change is intended to reduce the size 
and total number of In-network Rate 
Files, allow file users to more efficiently 
aggregate and analyze the data, and 
align reporting more closely to how data 
is typically reported by hospitals 
pursuant to the Hospital 2019 and 2023 
Price Transparency rules
58
under 45 
CFR part 180. 
a. Reducing File Size 
As discussed in section I.A. of this 
preamble, file size is the most common 
concern that the Departments have 
heard from interested parties regarding 
the current In-network Rate Files. These 
files are often very large, making them 
challenging for users to download, 
analyze, and store.
59
In-network Rate 
File sizes often represent many terabytes 
of data a month for a single issuer,
60
and 
many exceed most local storage and 
processing capabilities.
61
Additionally, 
each issuer may have hundreds of 
separate files for each plan or coverage 
it offers, making aggregation and 
analysis highly resource intensive.
62
 
The Departments have determined 
that the size of the In-network Rate File 
can be highly dependent on how it is 
organized. It is very common for 
multiple plans offered by the same 
issuer or administered by the same 
service provider to leverage the same 
provider networks with the same 
negotiated rates.
63
This means that 
when plans and issuers organize In- 
network Rate Files by plan ID, they 
often repeat the same negotiated rates 
across multiple plan files, which leads 
to significant duplicative data 
throughout the In-network Rate Files. 
The Departments have received 
consistent feedback about the challenges 
related to file size, and some of that 
feedback has suggested that the 
disclosure requirements be amended to 
organize In-network Rate Files by 
provider network, whereby each file 
would contain all rates negotiated by 
the reporting entity for that provider 
network, rather than having a file for 
each plan ID.

time-employers-bring-health-care-decisions-in- 
house. 
Currently, the technical 
implementation guidance for the In- 
network Rate File allows plans and 
issuers flexibility to leverage a Table of 
Contents File to combine common 
negotiated rates across multiple In- 
network Rate Files, rather than 
publishing negotiated rates individually 
for each plan ID. This allows issuers to 
avoid duplicating prices within and 
across plans by linking the files for each 
plan that uses a given provider network 
to an underlying file of in-network 
prices.
65
Interested parties report that 
this reduces the total amount of data 
that must be analyzed to estimate 
market-level prices.
66
Many plans and 
issuers currently leverage this 
optimization. The Departments 
conducted an internal analysis in 2024 
that sampled In-network Rate Files 
market wide and found that 83 percent 
of issuers sampled were leveraging a 
Table of Contents to organize their files. 
The Departments agree that where 
multiple plans share the same 
negotiated rates under an umbrella 
provider network, organizing the In- 
network Rate Files by provider network 
would decrease the size of the files, 
often significantly while still 
maintaining data integrity. Therefore, to 
standardize this method of organizing 
files across all plans and issuers, the 
Departments propose to amend the 
introductory language of paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) to require plans and issuers to 
make an In-network Rate File available 
for each provider network maintained or 
contracted by the plan or issuer. This 
approach would also reduce the total 
number of In-network Rate Files 
because there are far more plans and 
policies available than there are distinct, 
separately managed provider 
networks.
67
 
To make it easier for file users to 
determine in advance of downloading a 
provider network-level In-network Rate 
File whether it contains data of interest 
to them, the Departments propose to 
redesignate paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) 
through (C) as paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(B) 
through (D), respectively, and add a new 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) requiring each In- 
network Rate File to include the 
common provider network name for 
which negotiated rate information is 
included. The Departments seek 
comment on whether there is another 
term or code, in addition to or instead 
of the common provider network name, 
that would help producers or file users 
identify specific provider networks. The 
Departments expect plans and issuers to 
define what constitutes a separate 
provider network according to their 
current business practices. The 
Departments solicit comments on 
whether additional limitations on what 
constitutes a separate provider network 
should be required. 
In order to maintain the connection of 
rates to plans under this proposal, as 
further discussed in section III.C.2. of 
this preamble, the Departments also 
propose to amend redesignated 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) to require plans 
and issuers to identify, for each provider 
network for which the plan or issuer 
must publish an In-network Rate File, 
each of the plan’s or issuer’s coverage 
options that use that network. This 
would allow file users to cross reference 
the rates for a particular plan or policy 
of interest to its in-network rates. 
The Departments also propose 
conforming amendments to 
redesignated paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(C) and 
(D). Specifically, the Departments 
propose to amend redesignated 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) to specify that 
each In-network Rate File must include 
a billing code and a plain language 
description for each covered item or 
service included in the file, rather than 
under each coverage option offered by 
plans and issuers.
68
The Departments 
propose to amend redesignated 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(D) to specify that all 
applicable rates must be included for 
each covered item or service included in 
the file, rather than for all items or 
services the plan or issuer covers, since 
not all applicable rates for items or 
services the plan or issuer covers are 
negotiated under a given provider 
network. Since plans and issuers would 
be required to make an In-network Rate 
File available for each provider network 
they maintain or contract with, they 
would ultimately still be required to 
disclose all applicable rates for items or 
services they cover, but those rates may 
not all be reported in every In-network 
Rate File organized by provider 
network. 
The Departments are also proposing 
special aggregation rules for self-insured 
group health plans, which is described 
in more detail in section III.C.11. of this 
preamble. 
b. Other Improvements for File Users 
The Departments have determined 
that, overall, provider network-level 
files would simplify data aggregation 
and analysis for researchers and other 
groups interested in analyzing specific 
provider networks, which is important 
to facilitate consumer’s plan selection 
decisions. For example, the 
Departments understand that organizing 
In-network Rate Files by network would 
make it easier for employers and plan 
sponsors to analyze the negotiated rates 
of different networks to make informed 
decisions about which plans to offer 
their employees, potentially favoring 
networks with more competitive 
pricing, in addition to opening the door 
for employers to bring health care 
purchasing decisions in house through 
direct contracting with provider 
groups.
69
This proposal may be of 
particular benefit to smaller employers, 
who have historically had less leverage 
to negotiate directly with providers due 
to lower patient volume, by empowering 
them with access to network-level 
pricing data for negotiations. 
Similarly, organizing in-network rate 
information by provider network would 
help service providers advise clients on 
network selection and cost management 
strategies. Likewise, researchers, 
academics, and policymakers would be 
better positioned to analyze pricing 
variations across different providers, 
specialties, and geographic areas within 
the same provider network and between

The 14-digit HIOS ID is comprised of the 
following: (1) issuer’s ID number (first 5 digits, for 
example, 12345), (2) issuer’s State abbreviation 
(next 2 digits, for example, WA); (3) issuer’s three- 
digit Product ID (next 3 digits, for example, 001); 
and (4) a four-digit sequence number that is the 
‘‘Component ID’’ (last 4 digits, for example, 0001). 
Thus, HIOS ID at the 14-digit level would be

different networks that may inform 
policy interventions aimed at cost 
containment and market regulations. 
The Departments understand that 
State insurance regulators may also be 
able to use network-level data to inform 
and improve rate review processes, 
optimize public option plans, and 
potentially guide antitrust 
enforcement.
70
Currently, State 
regulators may review unit cost and 
utilization trends submitted by issuers 
as part of their rate review process. 
Access to more consumable provider 
rates by network and product type in 
the In-network Rate Files may make it 
easier for regulators to validate unit cost 
trends, and to use those trends to assess 
the reasonableness of premium 
increases. Also, the reduction of 
duplicative data in the In-network Rate 
Files may make it easier for States to 
monitor rates to identify collusive 
behaviors, as well as help establish 
benchmarks for negotiations with 
providers as part of State oversight 
activities related to coverage programs. 
c. Better Alignment With Hospital Price 
Transparency Reporting 
Organizing in-network rates by 
provider network would also promote 
standardization and streamlined 
comparison of pricing information 
across hospitals and health plans, 
consistent with Executive Order 
14221.
71
As discussed in section I.A. of 
this preamble, many interested parties 
have called for better alignment among 
Federal price transparency requirements 
to avoid consumer confusion and 
duplication of effort.
72
 
Currently, the Hospital Price 
Transparency machine-readable files 
required under 45 CFR part 180 
generally disclose rates at the provider 
network level.
73
By contrast, rates 
disclosed pursuant to the 2020 final 
rules are currently disclosed at the more 
granular plan or policy level, which 
presents complications for data 
matching. For example, a single set of 
Hospital Price Transparency rates 
negotiated between a plan and a 
hospital system could appear multiple 
times, under several different plan 
names, in an issuer’s current In-network 
Rate Files, without any reference to the 
provider network name in the Hospital 
Price Transparency file. Standardization 
of price disclosures for providers, plans, 
issuers, and procedures at the same 
level would allow for more accurate 
comparisons between the different types 
of transparency files. 
The Departments seek comment on all 
aspects of these proposals. 
2. HIOS Identifier and Product Type 
The Departments propose to amend 
the identifying coverage information 
that plans and issuers must disclose in 
the In-network Rate Files at 
redesignated 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(1)(i)(B), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(1)(i)(B), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(1)(i)(B), and in the Allowed 
Amount Files at 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(1)(ii)(A), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(1)(ii)(A), and 45 CFR 147.212 
(b)(1)(ii)(A). Specifically, the 
Departments propose to remove the 
requirement for plans and issuers to 
report the 14-digit Health Insurance 
Oversight System (HIOS) identifier (ID) 
or, if the 14-digit HIOS ID is not 
available, the 5-digit HIOS ID, and 
instead require them to report the HIOS 
identifier associated with each coverage 
option for which data is being reported 
in a form and manner as specified in 
guidance issued by the Departments. 
The Departments also propose to add a 
requirement for plans and issuers to 
report the product type (for example, 
Health Maintenance Organization 
(HMO) or Preferred Provider 
Organization (PPO)) associated with the 
coverage option for which data is being 
reported. 
The 2020 final rules require plans and 
issuers to include their 14-digit HIOS ID 
in the In-network Rate File and Allowed 
Amount File unless the plan or issuer 
does not have a 14-digit HIOS ID 
available, in which case the plan or 
issuer must include the HIOS ID at the 
5-digit issuer level.
74
If a plan or issuer 
does not have a HIOS ID, it must use its 
Employer Identification Number (EIN). 
The Departments received significant 
comments on GitHub about requiring 
the 14-digit HIOS ID,
75
stating that this 
requirement would result in an 
enormous amount of redundant data 
because provider rates are not 
established based on distinct plan 
designs, but rather they are applied 
across multiple plan offerings. The 
Departments have determined that the 
number of HIOS digits that plans and 
issuers must report is a technical 
implementation detail that should be 
removed from regulation and set forth in 
technical implementation guidance to 
better maintain the Departments’ 
flexibility to determine appropriate 
technical reporting requirements and to 
make refinements in response to 
changes in technology or health care 
industry business practice. This is in 
line with the Departments’ general 
approach as described in the preamble 
to the 2020 final rules, to provide 
specific technical direction in separate 
technical implementation guidance, 
rather than in rulemaking, in order to 
keep pace with and respond to 
technological developments.
76
The 
Departments propose to amend the 
reporting requirements to specify that 
for each applicable coverage option 
offered by a group health plan or health 
insurance issuer, the plan or issuer must 
report the name and the HIOS identifier, 
or, if no HIOS identifier is available, the 
EIN. 
In addition to the HIOS digit 
amendment, the Departments propose to 
amend redesignated paragraph 
(b)(1)(i)(B) and amend paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii)(A) to newly require plans and 
issuers to report the product type for 
each applicable coverage option offered 
by a plan or issuer in the In-network 
Rate File and Allowed Amount File, 
respectively. The Departments have 
received feedback that requiring plans 
and issuers to disclose health plan 
product types (for example, HMO, PPO) 
would promote more meaningful 
transparency around the health care 
pricing information disclosed in the In-

network Rate and Allowed Amount 
Files. The Departments agree with this 
feedback, as product types dictate the 
fundamental relationship between the 
payer and the provider regarding patient 
access and volume, which are key 
leverage points in contract negotiations 
over rates. For example, in instances 
where HMOs may have narrow 
networks, providers contracting with 
such HMOs are likely to see increased 
patient volume, which may encourage 
such providers to contract at a lower 
rate with the HMO than they might with 
a PPO that is less likely to result in 
higher patient volume. Product types 
also dictate the fundamental 
relationship between payer and patient, 
with differences, for example, related to 
patient choice, cost-sharing 
responsibilities, and accessibility. 
Additionally, the Departments have 
heard from interested parties that 
although negotiated rates under a 
provider network are typically 
consistent across plans and policies 
with respect to a specific item or service 
and a specific provider, these rates may 
differ based on product type. As such, 
interested parties have stated that 
requiring plans and issuers to include 
the product type for each applicable 
coverage option offered by the plan or 
issuer in the In-network Rate File would 
allow users to account for those 
differences. 
In addition to providing context on 
how prospective rates differ, the 
Departments have determined that 
adding a product type to the Allowed 
Amount Files would allow file users to 
compare how historical provider 
reimbursements differ based on product 
type. Disclosing product type data in the 
Allowed Amount Files would enable 
more accurate and actionable 
comparisons for employers, researchers, 
and regulators so they can understand 
true market pricing for specific product 
types. In addition, not only could users 
of these data make comparisons of 
allowed amounts across different 
product types for a specific service for 
a single payer, they could also make 
comparisons for the same service based 
on product type across different payers. 
For example, an employer or plan 
sponsor offering a PPO plan could 
benchmark their out-of-network costs 
specifically against other PPO plans in 
the market, rather than a generalized 
average that includes potentially lower- 
cost HMOs, and they could use this 
information to make future plan 
coverage determinations. Furthermore, 
with allowed amounts tied to product 
type, employers and plan sponsors 
would better understand the actual 
tradeoffs in plan design—that is, not just 
premiums and network access, but also 
how much the plan will pay when 
employees go out-of-network. One study 
on out-of-network behavioral health 
care in employer-sponsored coverage 
observed that balance billing was higher 
for HMO enrollees versus non-HMO 
enrollees.
77
With the inclusion of data 
on plan type, employers could use 
historical allowed amounts segmented 
by plan type to evaluate the level of 
financial protection offered for out-of- 
network services. 
The Departments acknowledge that 
product type is often used in the fully 
insured market, typically to comply 
with laws that apply to insured 
products. The Departments also 
acknowledge that the definitions of 
these product types may differ from 
State to State and seek comment on 
whether that would present difficulties 
for plans and issuers in determining 
which product type to indicate. The 
Departments also seek comment on 
whether possible inconsistency between 
State definitions of certain product 
types would cause confusion among file 
users. Under ERISA, self-insured plans 
are not currently required to be 
identified by product type and these 
traditional classifications may not 
necessarily apply or otherwise 
accurately describe a self-insured 
benefit arrangement. As such, the 
Departments seek comment on whether 
self-insured plans generally identify 
benefit package options by product type, 
whether there is any existing 
nomenclature that self-insured plans 
could use to accurately identify the type 
of benefit arrangement being offered, 
and whether it is practical to extend this 
requirement to self-insured plans. 
3. Percentage-of-Billed-Charges 
Arrangements 
The Departments propose to amend 
redesignated 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(1)(i)(D)(1), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(1)(i)(D)(1), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(1)(i)(D)(1) (redesignated from 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C)(1) as discussed in 
section III.C.1. of this preamble) of the 
In-network Rate Files provision to 
require that in-network rates must be 
reflected as a dollar amount except for 
contractual arrangements under which a 
plan or issuer agrees to pay an in- 
network provider a percentage of billed 
charges and is not able to assign a dollar 
amount to an item or service prior to a 
bill being generated. In such 
circumstances, plans and issuers must 
report a percentage number, in lieu of a 
dollar amount, in the form and manner 
as specified in guidance issued by the 
Departments. 
Paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) of the current 
In-network Rate File provision requires 
plans and issuers to publish all 
applicable rates, which may include one 
or more of the following: negotiated 
rates, underlying fee schedule rates, or 
derived amounts for all covered items 
and services in the In-network Rate File. 
The Departments specified in the 
preamble to the 2020 final rules that the 
In-network Rate File requirement 
applies to plans and issuers regardless 
of the type of payment model or models 
under which they provide 
reimbursement.
78
 
Under the 2020 final rules, paragraph 
(b)(1)(i)(C)(1) of the In-network Rate File 
provision requires that rates must be 
reflected in the In-network Rate File as 
dollar amounts and if the rate is subject 
to change based upon participant, 
beneficiary, or enrollee-specific 
characteristics, that these dollar 
amounts should be reflected as the base 
negotiated rate applicable to the item or 
service prior to adjustments for 
participant, beneficiary, or enrollee- 
specific characteristics. While there are 
alternative reimbursement arrangements 
that do not have a dollar amount 
associated with particular items and 
services before the item or service is 
furnished, a dollar amount can still be 
determined in some instances under 
these arrangements. Accordingly, in the 
preamble to the 2020 final rules, the 
Departments provided a list of 
alternative reimbursement arrangements 
and summarized general reporting 
expectations for these arrangements, 
while acknowledging that the list was 
not exhaustive, as there may be other 
alternative reimbursement or 
contracting arrangements in use.
79
 
Specifically, the Departments 
summarized the general reporting 
expectations, including for bundled 
payment arrangements and capitation 
arrangements (including sole capitation 
arrangements and partial capitation 
arrangements), reference-based pricing 
without a defined network, reference- 
based pricing with a defined network, 
and value-based purchasing. For 
example, the preamble to the 2020 final 
rules clarified that for payment 
arrangements under which adjustments 
are made after care is provided, the plan 
or issuer should disclose the base 
negotiated rate before adjustments are 
applied.

transparency-analyses/. 
After the 2020 final rules were issued, 
interested parties used GitHub
81
and 
other forums to raise to the 
Departments’ attention alternative 
payment arrangements under which 
reporting a current and accurate dollar 
amount for items and services in the In- 
network Rate File before the item or 
service is furnished may not be possible 
and requested guidance from the 
Departments on how to meet the 
disclosure requirements for such 
arrangements. Specifically, interested 
parties questioned the Departments on 
how to report dollar amounts for 
negotiated rates that result from certain 
‘‘percentage-of-billed-charges’’ contract 
arrangements, under which a dollar 
amount can be determined only 
retrospectively because the agreement 
between the plan or issuer and the in- 
network provider states that the plan or 
issuer will pay a fixed percentage of the 
billed charges. It is the Departments’ 
understanding that these types of 
arrangements are not uncommon for 
certain types of items or services (such 
as low-volume procedures or high-cost, 
outlier inpatient care). 
On April 19, 2022, the Departments 
issued FAQs Part 53
82
to provide an 
enforcement safe harbor for satisfying 
the reporting requirements for plans and 
issuers that use an alternative payment 
arrangement that does not permit them 
to derive with accuracy specific dollar 
amounts contracted for covered items 
and services in advance of the provision 
of that item or service, or that otherwise 
cannot disclose specific dollar amounts 
according to the file formatting 
requirements as provided in the 
Departments’ technical implementation 
guidance through GitHub. This 
guidance further advised that for 
contractual arrangements under which a 
plan or issuer agrees to pay an in- 
network provider a percentage of billed 
charges and is not able to assign a dollar 
amount to an item or service prior to a 
bill being generated, plans and issuers 
may report a percentage number, in lieu 
of a dollar amount. 
On September 27, 2023, the 
Departments clarified in FAQs Part 61
83
 
that whether a plan or issuer is able to 
comply with the requirement to disclose 
certain rates as dollar amounts is a fact- 
specific determination and that the 
Departments would exercise 
enforcement discretion with respect to 
this requirement on a case-by-case basis, 
without any categorical ‘‘safe harbor.’’ 
The Departments instructed plans and 
issuers that are unable to determine 
dollar amounts for the applicable rate 
element to continue to follow the 
existing technical implementation 
guidance on GitHub. 
Since issuing the guidance in 2023, 
the Departments have continued to 
receive feedback from interested parties 
that arrangements where a dollar 
amount is unable to be determined in 
advance are not uncommon and should 
be reflected in the data. Therefore, the 
Departments propose to amend 
redesignated 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(1)(i)(D)(1), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(1)(i)(D)(1), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(1)(i)(D)(1) to state that 
applicable rates must be reflected as 
dollar amounts, with respect to each 
covered item or service that is furnished 
by an in-network provider, except for 
contractual arrangements under which a 
group health plan or health insurance 
issuer agrees to pay an in-network 
provider a percentage of billed charges 
and is not able to assign a dollar amount 
to an item or service prior to a bill being 
generated. In these instances, plans and 
issuers must report a percentage 
number, in lieu of a dollar amount, in 
a form and manner as specified in 
guidance issued by the Departments. 
While the Departments recognize the 
importance of allowing plans and 
issuers to disclose non-dollar amount 
rates when a dollar amount is unknown 
in advance, the Departments reiterate 
that plans and issuers must disclose 
rates as a dollar amount whenever a 
dollar amount can be calculated in 
advance, including when a negotiated 
base rate can be calculated prior to 
adjustments. Further, the Departments 
emphasize that this proposed change, if 
finalized, would permit plans and 
issuers to disclose an applicable rate in 
a non-dollar amount only in instances 
where the applicable rate is a percentage 
of billed charges and expect that plans 
and issuers report all other applicable 
rates as dollar amounts consistent with 
the form and manner specified in 
guidance issued by the Departments. 
The Departments seek comment on 
this proposal. 
4. Enrollment Totals 
The Departments propose to add new 
26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(1)(i)(E), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(1)(i)(E), and 
45 CFR 147.212(b)(1)(i)(E) requiring 
plans and issuers to include in each In- 
network Rate File, current numerical 
enrollment totals, as of the date the file 
is posted, for each coverage option 
offered by a plan or issuer represented 
in the In-network Rate File. Such 
numerical enrollment totals must 
include the number of participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees (including 
all dependents) in the coverage option 
offered by a plan or issuer. 
Affordable Care Act sections 
1311(e)(3)(A)(iii) and (iv) require health 
plans seeking certification as a qualified 
health plan to submit to the Exchange, 
the Secretary, the State insurance 
commissioner, and make available to 
the public, accurate and timely 
disclosure of data on enrollment and 
disenrollment. PHS Act section 2715A, 
incorporated into ERISA section 715 
and Code section 9815, gives the 
Departments the statutory authority to 
require a plan or coverage that is not 
offered through an Exchange to submit 
the information required under 
Affordable Care Act section 1311(e)(3) 
to the Secretary and the relevant State’s 
insurance commissioner, and to make 
that information available to the public. 
However, the 2020 final rules do not 
require the disclosure of enrollment 
data. 
Since the publication of the 2020 final 
rules, the Departments have received 
feedback from interested parties on the 
importance of additional data elements 
that would allow users to weigh 
different plans and coverage options to 
understand their relative influence on 
the overall landscape of pricing in 
health insurance, such as plan 
enrollment numbers, in line with the 
goals stated in the 2020 final rules.

The Departments understand that 
requiring the reporting of plan 
enrollment counts would enable file 
users to develop analytical models that 
prioritize negotiated rates for health care

items and services based on the number 
of individuals covered by the 
corresponding plan or coverage, thereby 
focusing analysis on prices with the 
broadest impact on the insured 
population. Plans with higher 
enrollments may have a larger impact 
on negotiated rates, due to relative 
market power, approximate size of the 
overall market, and other factors. 
Additionally, this contextual 
information would expand 
opportunities to conduct analysis and 
compare rates across ‘‘like’’ plans. The 
Departments understand, based on 
feedback from interested parties, that 
enrollment data would be particularly 
useful in analyzing the small group and 
individual markets, where small 
differences may have pronounced 
impacts on trends and patterns. The 
Departments are specifying that the 
numerical enrollment totals must 
include the number of participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees (including 
all dependents) to distinguish from 
other reporting requirements plans and 
issuers are required to comply with. 
Therefore, the Departments have 
determined that requiring disclosure of 
this additional data in the In-network 
Rate File would provide important 
context to the health care pricing 
information and propose to require in 
new paragraph (b)(1)(i)(E) that plans and 
issuers are required to disclose 
enrollment totals for each coverage 
option they offer represented in the In- 
network Rate File. These proposed rules 
would require that plans and issuers 
include enrollment totals as of the date 
the In-network Rate File is posted. The 
Departments seek comment on the 
feasibility of including the enrollment 
total as of the date the file is posted and 
whether an enrollment total on a 
different specified date would be more 
feasible for file producers and more 
useful to the data users. The 
Departments also solicit comment on 
this proposal in general. 
5. Excluded Provider Information 
The Departments propose to add new 
26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(1)(i)(F), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(1)(i)(F), and 
45 CFR 147.212(b)(1)(i)(F) to the In- 
network Rate Files provision that would 
require plans and issuers to exclude 
from each In-network Rate File a 
provider and their negotiated rate 
(provider-rate combination) for an item 
or service, if the plan or issuer 
determines it is unlikely that such 
provider would be reimbursed for the 
item or service based on the scope of the 
provider’s license or area of specialty. 
The Departments further propose that 
plans and issuers must make such a 
determination using their internal 
provider taxonomy that is typically used 
during the claims adjudication process. 
The Departments have determined that 
excluding provider-rate combinations 
that are not likely to result in a 
reimbursement is necessary to limit 
unnecessary information that inflates 
file size and limits the accessibility of 
the data in the In-network Rate File. 
These proposed rules at paragraph 
(b)(1)(i)(F) would require plans and 
issuers to use their internal provider 
taxonomy that is typically used during 
the claims adjudication process to 
determine which provider-rate 
combinations to exclude from the In- 
network Rate File. The internal provider 
taxonomy is part of the claims 
adjudication workflow, in which the 
plan or issuer assesses whether the 
billed item or service (represented by a 
billing code) aligns with the specialty of 
the rendering provider (represented by a 
provider taxonomy code). If the 
specialty does not meet the plan or 
issuer’s requirements for that item or 
service, the claim may be denied. For 
example, the Departments expect that a 
plan or issuer’s internal provider 
taxonomy would be unlikely to 
reimburse a claim submitted for a heart 
surgery submitted from a podiatrist 
because the billing code associated with 
a heart surgery would not match with a 
taxonomy code for a podiatrist. 
The Departments understand that it is 
standard business practice for the 
internal provider taxonomy maintained 
by a plan or issuer to identify provider 
specialties using a standardized code set 
established by the National Uniform 
Claim Committee (NUCC).
85
The NUCC 
maintains standard provider taxonomy 
codes, which are used to define a 
provider’s area of specialty.
86
Provider 
taxonomy codes are ten characters in 
length structured into three distinct 
‘‘levels’’ including provider grouping, 
classification, and area of 
specialization.
87
The Departments 
understand that when a provider 
submits a claim for reimbursement to a 
plan or issuer, the provider must 
include their NUCC code and the billing 
code for the item or service along with 
certain other information. The 
Departments understand that plans and 
issuers then compare the NUCC 
provider taxonomy code and billing 
code included from the claim against 
their internal provider taxonomy 
mappings to determine if the claim can 
proceed through the next step of the 
payment adjudication process. 
The Departments have observed that 
several third-party data aggregation 
vendors successfully demonstrated 
various methods to efficiently filter 
existing machine-readable file content 
by utilizing NUCC provider taxonomy 
codes, demonstrating these codes can 
help determine whether a provider is 
likely going to be eligible for 
reimbursement for a specific service or 
procedure.
88
Therefore, the Departments 
have determined this may be a viable 
approach to excluding certain provider- 
rate combinations. 
The 2020 final rules at 26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A3(b)(1)(i)(C)(1), 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A3(b)(1)(i)(C)(1), and 45 
CFR 147.212(b)(1)(i)(C)(1) require plans 
and issuers to disclose all applicable 
rates for in-network providers, 
including negotiated rates, underlying 
fee schedule rates, or derived amounts, 
to the extent they may be used for 
purposes of determining provider 
reimbursement or cost-sharing for in- 
network providers. The 2020 final rules 
do not specify any exclusions to this 
requirement. As a result, the 
Departments have observed and have 
received feedback that In-network Rate 
Files often include negotiated rates for 
providers for items and services that 
those providers would not likely be 
reimbursed for because the items and 
services are outside their specialty (for 
example, a mental health provider 
billing for knee replacement).
89
The 
Departments understand that plans and 
issuers frequently negotiate applicable 
rates at the provider organization level 
(such as large multi-specialty physician 
groups or integrated health systems) for 
every provider who is a member of that 
organization, regardless of whether that

provider would be likely to be 
reimbursed for that item or service. 
Under the 2020 final rules, these rates 
are required to be disclosed. As a result, 
the Departments and interested parties 
have observed that there are many 
provider-rate combinations that are not 
meaningful for transparency purposes 
and impose unnecessary burden on both 
producers and users of the In-network 
Rate File. This overinclusion leads to 
significant file sizes, where In-network 
Rate Files are consistently enlarged by 
the inclusion of these unlikely provider- 
rate combinations. One early 
examination found that plans and 
issuers were posting approximately a 
petabyte (PB)
90
of information each 
month, in part due to the inclusion of 
what it refers to as ‘‘clinically 
implausible rates.’’
91
In September 
2024, the Departments analyzed a subset 
of In-network Rate Files and discovered 
that 73 percent of hematologists’ 
negotiated rates were for 500 billing 
codes for services for which they would 
be unlikely to be reimbursed for. 
Another researcher reported that 96.5 
percent of rates reported in the In- 
network Rate Files were for services 
with respect to providers who would be 
unlikely to be reimbursed for those 
services based on their specialty.
92
The 
Departments understand from feedback 
from interested parties that excessive 
file size creates network bandwidth and 
data storage problems for file producers 
and users alike, including significant 
costs associated with hosting, 
downloading, or analyzing significant 
amounts of data. 
In addition, the Departments 
understand that excess data of limited 
use poses an unnecessary barrier to 
analyzing these files for users seeking to 
understand health care price variation, 
and to carrying out research on pricing 
data.
93
For example, one researcher 
identified a negotiated rate for a 
Caesarean section (C-section) for a 
neurological institute that was almost 
ten times the median rate for a C-section 
in that geographic region.
94
The 
researcher identified that the 
neurological institute must share the 
same rate for a C-section with all the 
providers in their parent organization 
per their contract even though 
neurologists would be unlikely to be 
reimbursed for a C-section.
95
These rates 
may distort patterns, averages, and 
medians when conducting market-wide 
analyses, leading to an inaccurate 
understanding of health care prices.
96
 
The Departments recognize that the 
2020 final rules specifying that plans 
and issuers disclose all negotiated rates 
for all covered items and services for all 
in-network providers have led to the 
disclosure of rates beyond what was 
intended by the Departments. The 
Departments have determined that 
excluding provider-rate combinations 
for services that providers are unlikely 
to perform or be reimbursed for— 
because they fall outside their 
specialty—would significantly reduce 
the size of the In-network Rate Files. 
This significant decrease in file size 
would also reduce the storage space and 
computer processing resources needed 
to generate, store, and analyze In- 
network Rate Files, reducing burden for 
file producers and users alike. 
Therefore, the Departments propose to 
revise the content requirements for the 
In-network Rate File to require plans 
and issuers to exclude provider-rate 
combinations for an item or service if 
the provider would be unlikely to be 
reimbursed for the item or service given 
the provider’s area of specialty, 
according to the plan’s or issuer’s 
internal provider taxonomy that is 
typically used during the claims 
adjudication process. 
In order for users of the In-network 
Rate Files to understand how plans and 
issuers constructed the files according 
to this new proposed requirement, the 
Departments also propose to add new 26 
CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(2)(iii), 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A3(b)(2)(iii), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(2)(iii), to require plans and 
issuers to publish a taxonomy machine- 
readable file. As discussed in more 
detail in section III.C.7. of this 
preamble, this new machine-readable 
file would disclose the mapping of 
billing codes to internal provider 
taxonomy codes, providing 
transparency into how plans and issuers 
determined which provider-rate 
combinations for covered items and 
services have been excluded from the 
In-network Rate Files based on the 
plan’s or issuer’s taxonomy rules. 
The Departments seek comment on all 
aspects of this proposal. The 
Departments are particularly interested 
in feedback from interested parties on 
whether there are plans or issuers that 
do not map provider specialties to 
billing codes within their claims 
adjudication process or use different 
code sets, and whether there could be a 
way to standardize the provider 
specialty mapping to billing code 
process. The Departments are also 
interested in whether there are 
alternative approaches to excluding any 
provider that has a rate for an item or 
service that interested parties consider 
to not be a meaningful rate. While the 
Departments have included a discussion 
of some potential alternatives in section 
VI.D.2. of this preamble, the 
Departments are interested in feedback 
from interested parties on the relative 
burdens and benefits of alternative 
approaches to both producers and file 
users. The Departments are also 
interested in any concerns that parties 
may have with a proposal to require 
plans and issuers to make such 
exclusions at all. For instance, do file 
users have concerns about plans and 
issuers intentionally or inadvertently 
over-excluding provider-rate 
combinations from the In-network Rate 
File? Additionally, do file users 
recommend alternative approaches to 
best achieve the goals of transparency as 
set out in the 2020 final rules? For 
example, are there alternative 
approaches that will help meet the 
Departments’ goals of limiting 
unnecessary information that inflates 
file size, without limiting the 
accessibility of the data, and promoting 
meaningful transparency of in-network 
rate pricing information? 
6. Out-of-Network Allowed Amount

The Departments propose to make 
several amendments to the Allowed 
Amount File provision at 26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A3(b)(1)(ii), 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A3(b)(1)(ii), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(1)(ii) to increase the amount 
of historical out-of-network claims data 
disclosed in the files, including a

including claims from 20 to 11 different

claims per item or service, a proposal to 
increase the reporting period from 90 
days to 6 months, a proposal to increase 
the lookback period from 180 days to 9 
months, and a proposal to require 
reporting at the health insurance market 
level, rather than the plan or policy 
level. Lastly, the Departments propose 
to remove the phrase ‘‘and provider’’ 
from paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) to clarify 
that the claims threshold pertains to the 
number of claims for an item or service 
overall for the file, not the number of 
claims for an item or service from a 
particular provider. 
The 2020 final rules at paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii)(C) require plans and issuers to 
disclose on a public website a machine- 
readable file that includes, among other 
things, each unique out-of-network 
allowed amount with respect to covered 
items or services furnished by a 
particular out-of-network provider 
during the 90-day time period that 
begins 180 days prior to the publication 
date of the Allowed Amount File. In 
addition, plans and issuers must omit 
such data in relation to a particular item 
or service and provider when including 
it would require the plan or issuer to 
report payment of out-of-network 
allowed amounts in connection with 
fewer than 20 different claims for 
payments for an item or service under 
a single plan or coverage.
97
Current 
rules at paragraph (b)(4)(iii) also permit, 
but do not require, plans and issuers to 
satisfy the public disclosure 
requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) by 
making available out-of-network 
allowed amount data that has been 
aggregated to include information from 
more than one plan or policy, under 
certain circumstances. 
a. Reducing the Claims Threshold 
Initially, the Departments established 
the 20-claims threshold to limit the 
possibility that individual participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees may be 
identified through the public disclosure 
of historical allowed amount data. In the 
2019 proposed rules, the Departments 
proposed to require plans and issuers to 
omit out-of-network allowed amounts 
from the Allowed Amount File in 
relation to a particular item or service 
and provider when including this data 
would require the plan or issuer to 
report payment of out-of-network 
allowed amounts in connection with 
fewer than 10 different claims for 
payments.
98
The Departments requested 
comment on whether a higher minimum 
claims threshold, such as a threshold of 
20 claims, would better mitigate privacy 
concerns and minimize complexity in 
complying with Federal or State privacy 
laws without compromising the 
integrity of the compiled information.
99
 
As discussed in the 2020 final rules, 
some commenters expressed concerns 
about maintaining Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) protections on the Allowed 
Amount File due to the small number of 
claims associated with specific items 
and services for out-of-network 
providers.
100
Several commenters stated 
that the threshold of 10 different claims 
to require public disclosure of unique 
historical allowed amounts would be 
too low to protect consumers’ protected 
health information. Based on 
commenters’ concerns, the Departments 
determined that increasing the claims 
threshold from 10 to 20 claims in the 
2020 final rules would better balance 
the policy goal of transparency with the 
need to protect participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees from the 
possibility of being re-identified through 
the data included in the Allowed 
Amount File.
101
 
The Departments clarified in 
technical implementation guidance that 
while a plan or issuer with fewer than 
20 claims for a particular item or service 
must omit information on payment of 
out-of-network allowed amounts for that 
item or service, the Allowed Amount 
File must still be produced pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C); however, 
information in the file would be 
minimal due to the lack of information 
to report.
102
The Departments reasoned 
that the file must be created so that file 
users know that the plan or issuer does 
not have any claims that meet the 20- 
claims threshold, and that maintenance 
of such files would be minimal.
103
 
Since the publication of the 2020 final 
rules, however, the Departments have 
received feedback and observed that 
many plans and issuers produce 
Allowed Amount Files with limited to 
no out-of-network claims data, which 
the Departments have determined is due 
in part to the 20-claims threshold. Given 
the limited data available, file users are 
unable to perform meaningful analyses 
using out-of-network data.
104
This is 
because there are too many ‘‘gaps’’ in 
out-of-network data in the file, which 
occur whenever there are fewer than 20 
claims for a specific out-of-network item 
or service for a given plan. 
Out-of-network price transparency 
data is vital for employers, researchers, 
and regulators to analyze health care 
spending, benchmark costs, and inform 
future policy decisions. This data offers 
new insight into actual health care 
expenditures, including a window into 
the price of an item or service in the 
context of an arms-length transaction 
between a provider and a plan or issuer 
who have not negotiated the rate, and 
where there is therefore no discount 
associated with the advantage to a 
provider of being ‘‘in network.’’
105
 
Employers and plan sponsors can use 
this data to benchmark costs, refine 
benefit designs, and negotiate more 
effectively with administrators. Health 
care providers and service providers can 
use it to estimate what they might be 
reimbursed and what their patients or 
their participants, beneficiaries, or 
enrollees, respectively, might be 
charged for out-of-network care.
106
 
Therefore, to increase the volume of 
allowed amount data available, the 
Departments propose to amend 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) to lower the 
minimum claims threshold for a 
particular item or service under a single 
plan or coverage to 11 different claims 
for a particular item or service in a 
single health insurance market. The 
proposed 11-claims threshold would 
align with the CMS cell suppression 
policy, which sets minimum thresholds 
for the display of CMS data by 
researchers or other custodians of CMS 
data sets, such as Limited Data Set 
(LDS) files.
107

Technical Clarifications Question 23: After we 
compile all our allowed amounts and billed charges 
for the Allowed Amount file, how do we adjust the 
file to make sure we have taken into account the 
20-claim threshold?, https://www.cms.gov/

no cell (such as admittances, discharges, 
patients, services, etc.) containing a 
value of 1 to 10 can be reported 
directly.
108
This policy is a safeguard 
designed to prevent the identification of 
individual Medicare or Medicaid 
beneficiaries when CMS data is shared 
publicly
109
and helps ensure 
compliance with Federal privacy laws, 
such as HIPAA, by reducing the risk of 
re-identification of individuals from 
aggregated data. 
The Departments have determined 
that the proposed 11-claims threshold, 
combined with the proposal to require 
reporting by health insurance market 
type discussed later in this section of 
the preamble, would provide sufficient 
protection against the disclosure of 
sensitive patient information. Under the 
proposal to require reporting by health 
insurance market type, data disclosed in 
the Allowed Amount Files would not be 
directly associated with a single plan or 
policy when two or more plans or 
policies are aggregated into one file (as 
discussed in more detail later in this 
section of the preamble). Instead, the 
data would be aggregated to a broader 
health insurance market type (such as 
‘‘individual market’’ or ‘‘large group 
market’’). For example, a unique 
allowed amount and billed charge for a 
given item or service furnished by a 
given provider might be associated with 
‘‘Large Group Market offered by Insurer 
A,’’ rather than ‘‘Insurer A’s Employer X 
Gold PPO Plan.’’ This high-level 
aggregation would provide a strong 
shield for patient privacy. 
Additionally, the Departments also 
note that, as specified in current 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C), disclosure of 
such information would not be required 
if doing so would violate applicable 
health information privacy laws. This is 
consistent with paragraph (c)(3), which 
specifies that, among other things, 
nothing in 26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3, 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3, or 45 CFR 
147.212 alters or otherwise affects a 
plan’s or issuer’s duty to comply with 
requirements under other applicable 
State or Federal laws, including those 
governing the privacy or security of 
information required to be disclosed 
under this section. 
As such, the Departments have 
determined that lowering the claims 
threshold in this way would strike a 
better balance between protecting 
sensitive health information and 
allowing for a more comprehensive and 
useful dataset to support the end goals 
of price transparency. 
Lastly, the Departments propose to 
delete ‘‘and provider’’ from the 
parenthetical language in (b)(1)(ii)(C) to 
more clearly specify that the claims 
threshold pertains to the number of 
claims for an item or service overall for 
the file, not the number of claims for an 
item or service from a particular 
provider. This change would reflect the 
Departments’ current policy (other than 
the proposed changes to this paragraph 
discussed elsewhere in this section of 
the preamble), and is proposed as a 
technical clarification.
110
The 
parenthetical in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) 
would be revised to specify that a plan 
or issuer must omit out-of-network 
allowed amount and billed charge data 
in relation to a particular item or service 
if including it would require the plan or 
issuer to report payment of out-of- 
network allowed amounts in connection 
with fewer than 11 different claims for 
payment of that item or service in a 
single health insurance market. The 
Departments seek comment on this 
proposal. 
b. Increasing the Reporting Period 
The Departments also propose to 
amend paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) to specify 
that plans and issuers would be 
required to include in the Allowed 
Amount File allowed amounts and 
billed charges with respect to covered 
items or services furnished by out-of- 
network providers during the 6-month 
time period that begins 9 months prior 
to the publication date of the file. This 
amendment would increase the 
reporting period from 90 days to 6 
months and increase the lookback 
period from 180 days to 9 months. In 
the preamble to the 2020 final rules, the 
Departments noted that they would 
monitor the implementation of the 
lookback period for the Allowed 
Amount Files and may revisit it if the 
90-day reporting period and 180-day 
lookback period failed to yield sufficient 
out-of-network data on allowed 
amounts.
111
By approximately doubling 
the reporting period from 90 days to 6 
months and shifting the lookback period 
from 180 days to 9 months, the 
Departments expect that more out-of- 
network claims for items and services 
would meet the required threshold for 
reporting requirements, meaning there 
would be more data to populate the 
Allowed Amount Files. 
The Departments welcome comment 
on all aspects of this proposal. The 
Departments are also particularly 
interested in feedback on the impact of 
the proposed amendment to the 
required reporting cadence (proposed to 
be quarterly as discussed in section 
III.C.10. of this preamble) on the 
proposed changes to the lookback 
period. For example, since the proposed 
quarterly reporting period would 
require reporting 6 months’ worth of 
data every 3 months, the Departments 
seek comment on whether a potential 
duplication of out-of-network allowed 
amounts across multiple files would 
present any difficulties for the analysis 
of the data, such as calculating averages 
or annual amounts. 
c. Aggregating Data by Requiring 
Reporting by Market Type 
Lastly, the Departments propose to 
amend the introductory language in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) to require plans and 
issuers to aggregate their allowed 
amount reporting at the health 
insurance market level (as defined in 
proposed new 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A1(a)(2)(xi), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A1(a)(2)(x), and 45 CFR 
147.210(a)(2)(xi) and discussed in 
section III.A. of this preamble). 
Specifically, under paragraph (b)(1)(ii), 
plans and issuers would be required to 
make available an Allowed Amount File 
for each health insurance market in 
which a plan or coverage is offered. The 
Departments also propose to make 
conforming amendments in paragraphs 
(b)(1)(ii)(A) through (C) to indicate that 
each Allowed Amount File for a given 
health insurance market must include 
information aggregated across the 
coverage options offered by the plan or 
issuer in that market, rather than all 
coverage options offered by the plan or 
issuer. 
The Departments have received 
feedback from interested parties 
indicating that aggregating health 
insurance out-of-network claims by 
health insurance market type— 
specifically (1) individual market, (2) 
large group market, (3) small group 
market, and (4) self-insured group 
health plans maintained by the same 
plan sponsor—provides a structured 
approach to organizing and analyzing 
claims data. Interested parties suggested 
that this categorization would be useful 
because pricing dynamics and 
reimbursement rates tend to vary by

There is evidence of consistent alignment 
within market types and significant divergence between market types when comparing allowed amounts relative to a common benchmark 
(Medicare). This pattern holds even for in-network 
prices. Out-of-network allowed amounts often 
derive from similar underlying cost structures.

www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/ 
hlthaff.2024.00913. 
113
As previously mentioned, several proposed 
amendments would amend requirements related to 
the prescription drug machine-readable files, 
specifically: the requirement that plans and issuers 
must include a plain text file in a .txt format in the 
root folder of a plan’s or issuer’s website as describe 
in proposed paragraphs (b)(2)(iv) of 26 CFR 
54.9815-2715A3, 29 CFR 2590.715-2715A3, and 45 
CFR 147.212 (section III.C.7.d of this preamble) and 
the requirements related to the method and format 
for disclosing information to the public as described 
in proposed paragraph (b)(3) of 26 CFR 54.9815- 
2715A3, 29 CFR 2590.715-2715A3, and 45 CFR 
147.212 (section III.C.9 of this preamble). 
114
The 2020 final rules stated that ‘‘many 
consumers do not fully comprehend the basics of 
health coverage, much less the more complex facets 
of the health care system that can affect an 
individual’s out-of-pocket cost for items and 
services, including: Its specialized billing codes and 
payment processes; the various specialized terms 
used in plan and coverage contracts and related 
documents (such as copayment and coinsurance); 
and the various billing and payment structures 
plans and issuers use to compensate providers and 
assign cost-sharing liability to individuals (for 
example, bundled payment arrangements).’’ 85 FR 
72158, 72210 (November 12, 2020). 
market segments.
112
Therefore, the 
Departments expect that organizing out- 
of-network allowed amounts in this way 
would facilitate a more comprehensive 
assessment of the volume and 
characteristics of out-of-network claims 
and enhance the data’s utility for users 
by aligning it with the distinct pricing 
structures and regulatory environments 
of each market type. It would also make 
comparing allowed amounts for plans 
and policies within the same market 
easier for file users. 
If this proposed amendment is 
finalized, the Departments also 
anticipate a significant reduction in the 
overall number of Allowed Amount 
Files (since these would be reported at 
the market level, rather than at the plan 
level), even as those data files become 
more populated. Additionally, this 
approach would further protect patient 
privacy, as discussed earlier in this 
section of the preamble, because data 
aggregated across two or more plans or 
policies would not be directly 
associated with a single plan or policy. 
On the other hand, the Departments 
acknowledge that requiring market-level 
aggregation may limit or eliminate the 
ability of file users to map specific 
allowed amounts and billed charges to 
an individual plan or policy. However, 
plans and issuers would still be 
required under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) to 
disclose information about the plans or 
policies whose allowed amounts are 
included in each file. Therefore, file 
users would be able to determine which 
plans or policies have allowed amounts 
included in the Allowed Amount File, 
even if they would be unable to match 
a specific out-of-network allowed 
amount to a particular plan or policy. 
The Departments have determined that 
the advantages of having more 
populated Allowed Amount Files at the 
market level would outweigh the 
drawbacks of missing plan-level data. 
The Departments seek comment on 
what additional information might be 
limited or lost by aggregating allowed 
amount and billed charges data by 
health insurance market type, and the 
potential importance of that information 
to price transparency. The Departments 
also invite comments more broadly on 
the proposal to require reporting of out- 
of-network allowed amount data by 
health insurance market type. 
Lastly, the Departments are also 
proposing special aggregation rules for 
self-insured group health plans, which 
are described in more detail in section 
III.C.11. of this preamble. The 
Departments request comment on all 
aspects of these proposals. For a 
discussion of the Departments’ proposal 
to amend paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) related 
to disclosing HIOS IDs and product 
types in Allowed Amount Files, see 
section III.C.2. of this preamble. 
7. Contextual Files: Change-log, 
Utilization, Taxonomy, and Text 
The Departments propose to require 
plans and issuers to publicly disclose, 
through machine-readable files, 
additional contextual information that 
would help file users better understand 
the public disclosures required under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i). These files, which 
include a Change-log File, Utilization 
File, and Taxonomy File would contain 
information about the data within the 
In-network Rate and Allowed Amount 
Files. The Departments also propose to 
require a contextual machine-readable 
file to help users find the In-Network 
Rate, Allowed Amount, and 
prescription drug machine-readable files 
required under paragraph (b)(1) and 
new paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
which the Departments are proposing to 
identify as a Text File.
113
In particular, 
the Departments propose to amend 26 
CFR 54.9815–2715A3, 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A3, and 45 CFR 147.212 
to redesignate paragraphs (b)(2) through 
(4) as paragraphs (b)(3) through (5), 
respectively, and to add new paragraph 
(b)(2) to require contextual files. 
Specifically, the Departments propose to 
add new paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through 
(iv) requiring: a Change-log File at 
paragraph (b)(2)(i), a Utilization File at 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii), a Taxonomy File at 
paragraph (b)(2)(iii), and a Text File at 
paragraph (b)(2)(iv). 
The 2020 final rules at 26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A3(b), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b), and 45 CFR 147.212(b) 
require plans and issuers to make 
available on a public internet website 
the disclosure of health care pricing 
information in machine-readable files, 
in accordance with specific manner and 
format requirements. In particular, the 
Departments require plans and issuers 
to disclose in-network provider rates, 
out-of-network allowed amounts and 
the associated billed charges and 
negotiated rates and historic net prices 
for prescription drugs. In the 2020 final 
rules, the Departments recognized the 
necessity of public disclosure of health 
care pricing information due to the 
variation in health care prices across the 
health care industry and the complexity 
of health insurance and health plan 
coverage.
114
 
While price disclosures required in 
the 2020 final rules contributed to a 
broader understanding of the data that 
drives plan and issuer payments for 
health care items and services, the 
intervening years demonstrated that 
additional context is necessary to 
promote a fuller understanding of health 
care industry pricing dynamics. These 
proposed additional files would help 
make the data disclosures of the 
machine-readable files required under 
paragraph (b)(1) more meaningful and 
accessible, which would promote 
greater transparency in health care 
pricing information. Under this 
proposal, plans and issuers would be 
required to prepare a Change-log File, a 
Utilization File, and a Taxonomy File 
for each In-network Rate File prepared 
pursuant to these proposed rules, and a 
single Text File to facilitate locating the 
other machine-readable files required 
under these proposed rules. Each 
Change-log File would reflect changes 
in data from one In-network Rate File 
(under these proposed rules, prepared 
for a specific provider network) to the 
publishing of the next In-network Rate 
File; each Utilization File would reflect 
utilized covered items and services 
under the plans and policies 
represented in one In-network Rate File; 
and each Taxonomy File would 
represent the mapping of billing codes 
to internal provider taxonomy codes 
used as part of the claims adjudication

process for the plans and policies 
represented in the In-network Rate File. 
Each Text File would direct users to the 
location of the machine-readable files 
required under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) 
and provide contact information for an 
individual who can address inquiries 
and issues related to the required 
machine-readable files. To ensure this 
data can be imported and read by a 
computer system directly, without 
reliance on proprietary software, and to 
promote standardization, these 
contextual files would also need to be 
machine-readable, in the form and 
manner as specified in guidance 
pursuant to proposed re-designated 
paragraph (b)(3)(i). 
a. Change-log File 
The Departments propose to require, 
in new 26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(2)(i), 
29 CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(2)(i), and 
45 CFR 147.212(b)(2)(i), that plans and 
issuers must make available, in a 
machine-readable format, a Change-log 
File for each In-network Rate File, that 
identifies any changes made to the 
required information in the In-network 
Rate File since the immediately 
preceding published In-network Rate 
File. The proposed Change-log File 
would be required to be publicly posted 
in the form as specified in guidance 
issued by the Departments, consistent 
with redesignated and amended 
paragraph (b)(3) and discussed in 
section III.C.9. of this preamble. It 
would be required to be posted in 
accordance with the timing 
requirements proposed at redesignated 
paragraph (b)(4)(iii) and discussed in 
section III.C.10. of this preamble. 
Specifically, it would be required to be 
posted on the first day of the calendar- 
year quarter following the date on 
which the first In-network Rate File 
would be required to be posted under 
proposed paragraph (b)(4)(i).
115
The 
purpose of the proposed Change-log File 
would be to assist all file users in 
identifying changes to the required 
information in the In-network Rate File 
from one reporting period to the next. 
Pursuant to the proposed requirement to 
publish the In-network Rate File 
described at (b)(1)(i) quarterly, the 
updated Change-log File would also be 
required to be published quarterly, 
indicating whether or not there were 
changes. 
The total amount of information 
contained in every plan’s and issuer’s 
set of machine-readable files is 
extremely large,
116
creating challenges 
for file users of all backgrounds in 
ingesting and analyzing the information. 
Therefore, rather than downloading and 
analyzing each set of newly posted files 
to determine if there have been any 
changes to the required information in 
a plan’s or issuer’s In-network Rate File, 
file users would only need to look at the 
Change-log File to determine which new 
files they need to examine. These 
proposed rules would create efficiencies 
for file users by reducing the amount of 
required data storage for file users and 
save time by eliminating the need to 
review data that has not changed. This 
would also allow researchers and other 
interested parties to more easily track 
changes over time. 
The Departments seek comment on 
how the Change-log File can be most 
effective, including what machine- 
readable file format it should be 
required to be published. The 
Departments also seek comment on if 
any specific information should be 
required to be included, and if so, what 
information should be required to be 
included in the Change-log File. For 
example, the Departments are interested 
in feedback from interested parties on 
whether the Change-log File should 
only identify the information in the file 
that has changed between one reporting 
to the next or if it should also identify 
how the specific information has 
changed since the last reporting. The 
Departments also seek comment on 
whether there are particular data 
elements that, when changed, should 
not be captured in the Change-log File 
so as to maximize the usefulness of the 
reporting. The Departments expect that 
plans and issuers would likely incur a 
burden from having to create this new 
file and develop a system for identifying 
changes, therefore the Departments are 
interested in the minimal level of 
change information necessary to create 
the desired efficiencies. For instance, 
the Departments assume that identifying 
changes to rate information from one In- 
network Rate File to the next is critical 
to the usefulness of the Change-log File 
but are less certain of the relative 
benefits and drawbacks of requiring 
plans and issuers to identify less 
material changes, such as minor changes 
to the plain language description for 
each billing code. The Departments also 
seek comment on the specific burdens 
to plans and issuers for the different 
possibilities for a Change-log File. 
b. Utilization File 
The Departments propose to require at 
new paragraphs 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(2)(ii), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(2)(ii), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(2)(ii), that plans and issuers 
must make available in a machine- 
readable format an annual Utilization 
File for each In-network Rate File 
specified under paragraph (b)(1)(i), that 
includes, for the 12-month period that 
ends 6 months prior to the publication 
of each Utilization File: items and 
services covered under the plans or 
policies included in the files prepared 
as specified in proposed amended 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) for which a claim has 
been submitted and reimbursed, in 
whole or in part, and each in-network 
provider identified by the National 
Provider Identifier (NPI), Tax 
Identification Number (TIN), and Place 
of Service Code who was reimbursed, in 
whole or in part, for a claim for each 
covered item or service included as 
specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of 
this section. The Utilization File would 
be required to be published in the form 
and manner specified in proposed 
redesignated paragraph (b)(3) and 
discussed in section III.C.9. of this 
preamble and in accordance with the 
timing requirements proposed at 
redesignated paragraph (b)(4)(iv) and 
discussed in section III.C.10. of this 
preamble. Specifically, it would be 
required to be updated and posted 
annually beginning on the first day of 
the calendar-year quarter following the 
applicability date under paragraph 
(c)(1). Plans and issuers would be 
required to update and post the 
Utilization File in accordance with the 
timing requirements proposed at 
redesignated paragraph (b)(4)(iv) and 
discussed in section III.C.10. of this 
preamble. 
The Departments have determined 
that the Utilization File would provide 
important insights, both as a stand-alone 
dataset, as well as in combination with 
the In-network Rate File. On its own, 
the Utilization File would reveal which 
providers are actively serving enrollees 
and delivering covered items and 
services within a plan’s or issuer’s 
network. If a provider appears in a 
plan’s or issuer’s In-network Rate File 
but does not appear in the plan’s or 
issuer’s Utilization File, then users may 
reasonably conclude that that provider, 
despite having a negotiated rate, has had 
no recent interactions with that plan’s 
or issuer’s participants, beneficiaries, or 
enrollees. This type of analytical 
approach to the Utilization File would 
provide empirical evidence regarding 
which providers are actively providing

covered items and services to 
participants, beneficiaries, or enrollees 
and billing for items or services within 
a plan’s network, as opposed to relying 
on static provider directories, which can 
be over-inclusive when describing 
providers’ availability. In turn, the 
Utilization File could aid consumers in 
understanding whether certain 
providers are actually available 
(whether they are actively seeking new 
patients or have the capacity to accept 
new patients) to provide covered items 
and services to participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees under 
certain plans. 
Extending this type of analysis to all 
providers for a plan or issuer’s network 
could provide important insights into 
network adequacy. For example, a 
plan’s In-network Rate File might 
include many providers who, in theory, 
deliver a wide range of services in a 
particular geographic area. However, if 
the Utilization File reveals that those 
providers are not actually delivering 
those services, then this could indicate 
whether health plans are offering a 
sufficient and accessible network of 
providers for the services their members 
use. 
The Utilization File could also 
provide insights into the types of 
services performed by specific 
providers, by indicating whether those 
providers perform more routine 
procedures within their field of 
expertise or instead concentrate on rarer 
or more complex procedures. This type 
of analysis performed with the 
Utilization File could reveal whether 
networks in specific geographic areas 
have larger pools of providers 
performing certain procedures, thereby 
offering valuable insights into regional 
provider availability and specialization. 
Such insights into provider 
specialization would not be evident 
from the In-network Rate File alone, 
since that file lists negotiated rates for 
all services, regardless of whether a 
specific provider actually performs 
them. 
The Departments have determined 
that taken together, these examples of 
analyses that could be performed with 
the Utilization File suggest that this file 
would become a valuable transparency 
resource for researchers, regulators, 
consumer-facing decision-tool makers, 
and other interested parties, who could 
help consumers benefit from a more 
accurate picture of provider service 
patterns, along with the information 
published in the In-network Rate Files. 
Some organizations that currently use 
the In-network Rate Files already 
combine the data in those files with 
utilization data from other sources to 
conduct these types of analyses.
117
But 
by requiring plans and issuers to 
generate and publish Utilization Files, 
this pairing of in-network rates to actual 
utilization would become more widely 
and consistently available to users of the 
Transparency in Coverage pricing data. 
Finally, the Utilization Files would act 
as an important qualifier to the data 
disclosed in the In-network Rate Files, 
by providing a strong indication of the 
degree to which negotiated rates are 
used by providers to deliver actual 
services to health plan enrollees. 
Under this proposed requirement, 
plans and issuers would not be required 
to disclose the number of times that any 
given provider submitted a claim for 
any particular item or service, but rather 
only that a given provider submitted 
and was reimbursed, partially or in 
whole, for at least one claim for a 
covered item or service during the 
reporting period. The Departments have 
determined this appropriately balances 
the need for additional transparency 
around which in-network providers are 
actively providing a covered item or 
service with the burden on plans and 
issuers associated with extracting data 
from a claims data repository. The 
Departments recognize that because 
plans and issuers would not be required 
to disclose the number of items and 
services performed by specific 
providers, the Utilization File would be 
limited in its ability to address some 
research questions that might be of 
interest to some interested parties. As 
such, the Departments request comment 
on whether the inclusion of the volume 
of items and services performed by an 
in-network provider would be a 
valuable addition to the Utilization File. 
The Departments also request comment 
on whether additional data elements, 
such as metrics analyzing a plan or 
overall percentage of providers with 
zero utilization for the lookback period 
should be included in order to make it 
easier for file users to examine provider 
network adequacy. The Departments 
also request comment on the burden to 
plans and issuers to produce a 
Utilization File with claims volume and 
any additional metrics included in the 
files, as well as comments on how to 
mitigate these concerns. 
The Departments are also proposing at 
26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(2)(ii), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(2)(ii), and 45 
CFR 147.212(b)(2)(ii), to require the 
Utilization File to include data for the 
12-month period that ends 6 months 
prior to the publication date of each 
Utilization File, to allow for enough 
time for plans and issuers to complete 
the claims processing lifecycle 
including pre-claim submission, pre- 
claim payment, and payment 
determination and collection.
118
This 
figure is obtained from research 
suggesting that claims that take the 
longest to resolve can take up to 75 days 
to reach payment determination.
119
 
While 75 days is considerably shorter 
than 6 months, due to the lack of 
available metrics on the time it takes 
payers to complete payment to 
providers, the Departments propose a 
longer lookback period to ensure the 
Utilization File captures all applicable 
payments. 
The Departments request comment on 
this lookback period. 
c. Taxonomy File 
The Departments propose at new 26 
CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(2)(iii), 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A3(b)(2)(iii), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(2)(iii), to require plans and 
issuers to make available, in a machine- 
readable format, a Taxonomy File that 
includes the plan or issuer’s internal 
provider taxonomy, which maps items 
and services (represented by a billing 
code) to provider specialties 
(represented by specialty code as 
established by the NUCC) to determine 
if the plan or issuer should deny 
reimbursement for an item or service 
because it was not furnished by a 
provider in an appropriate specialty. 
Under these proposed rules and as 
discussed in section III.C.5. of this 
preamble, plans and issuers would be 
required to use their internal provider 
taxonomy to determine whether to 
exclude certain provider-rate 
combinations from the In-Network Rate 
file because they are unlikely to result 
in reimbursement, and therefore do not 
provide useful information to users of 
the In-network Rate File. The Taxonomy 
File would be required to include the 
plan or issuer’s internal provider 
taxonomy mappings and would be 
required to be published in the form and 
manner specified in proposed 
redesignated paragraph (b)(3) and 
discussed in section III.C.9. of this 
preamble. Additionally, and as 
discussed in section III.C.10. of this 
preamble, the Departments propose to

As previously mentioned, proposed paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv) (relating to the proposed requirement to 
include a plain text file in a .txt format in the root 
folder of a plan’s or issuer’s website) and (b)(3) 
(relating to the method and format for disclosing 
information to the public) of 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3, 29 CFR 2590.715–2715A3, and 45 CFR 
147.212 applies to the prescription drug machine-

Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Use 
of Pricing Information Published Under the 
Transparency in Coverage Final Rule, https://
www.cms.gov/priorities/healthplan-price- 
transparency/overview/use-pricing-information- 
published-under-transparency-coverage-final-rule 
(last modified Aug. 14, 2025). 
add paragraph (b)(4)(v) to require plans 
and issuers to post an updated 
Taxonomy File quarterly beginning on 
the first day of the calendar-year quarter 
following the applicability date under 
paragraph (c)(1). If there are no changes 
to the taxonomy that affect the 
information required in the machine- 
readable file required under (b)(1)(i) in 
a subsequent quarter, the posted 
Taxonomy File would not be required to 
be updated for that quarter. 
The Taxonomy File would provide 
transparency into how plans and issuers 
determine whether to exclude certain 
provider-rate combinations from an In- 
network Rate File. As explained in 
section III.C.5. of this preamble, the 
Departments are proposing to require 
plans and issuers to exclude from each 
In-network Rate File a provider-rate 
combination for an item or service, if 
the provider would be unlikely to be 
reimbursed for the item or service given 
that provider’s area of specialty, 
according to the plan’s or issuer’s 
internal provider taxonomy. This is 
because rates for such items and 
services generally do not provide useful 
information to users of the In-network 
Rate File, and excluding them would 
improve the reliability of the data 
reported and significantly reduce the 
file size. 
The Departments have determined 
that it is necessary to give plans and 
issuers specific guidance for how to 
exclude provider-rate combinations for 
items and services for which the 
provider would not likely be reimbursed 
given their practice area of specialty, 
rather than leaving it to each plan and 
issuer to determine how to exclude such 
information. Accordingly, the 
Departments have determined that plans 
and issuers should be required to post 
their internal provider taxonomy 
mappings in the Taxonomy File. 
Requiring plans and issuers to create 
a separate provider Taxonomy File that 
discloses their internal provider 
taxonomy would provide valuable data 
for file users about the data included in 
the In-network Rate File. The Taxonomy 
File would disclose the mapping rules 
already used by plans and issuers for 
their claims adjudication process, 
ensuring that the mapping rules could 
be available to file users to understand 
how plans and issuers determined 
which provider-rate combinations to 
include in the In-network Rate Files and 
which to exclude. 
In addition to providing critical 
contextual information to understand 
the data in the In-network Rate File, the 
proposed requirement for plans and 
issuers to provide a Taxonomy File 
would also offer researchers and other 
file users potentially valuable insights 
into the degree of standardization in 
mapping used by plans and issuers, and 
how this varies across different market 
types. Furthermore, the Taxonomy File 
would offer new information to 
potentially guide future rate 
negotiations between plans and issuers 
and providers, particularly concerning 
the scope of reimbursable services by 
provider type to include in contract 
discussions. 
The Departments solicit comment on 
the Taxonomy File proposal, including 
whether there are other provider 
taxonomy code sets commonly used by 
plans and issuers other than the ones 
established by the NUCC or if there are 
other commonly used processes for 
plans and issuers to determine which 
providers should be reimbursed for 
which types of items and services, based 
on specialty, and which providers 
should not. The Departments also seek 
comment on how frequently plans and 
issuers update their internal taxonomy 
used during the claims adjudication 
process. 
d. Text File 
The Departments also propose to add 
paragraphs 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(2)(iv), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(2)(iv), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(2)(iv), requiring plans and 
issuers to post a plain text file in .txt 
format (Text File) in the root folder (the 
top-level directory on an electronic file 
system) of a plan’s or issuer’s website 
that includes: (1) the source page URL 
for the internet website that hosts 
machine-readable files required under 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2); (2) a direct 
link to the URL for the machine- 
readable files required under paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (2); and (3) point-of-contact 
information including an up-to-date 
name, title, and email address for an 
individual who can address inquiries 
and issues related to the machine- 
readable files required under paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (2).
120
This contact 
information must be prominently 
displayed on the same website where 
the machine-readable files are made 
available and be kept updated per the 
requirements in paragraph (b)(4)(vi) of 
this section. This information would 
allow users to more easily locate the 
plan’s or issuer’s machine-readable files, 
increasing both automated and non- 
automated access to the machine- 
readable files. Additionally, and as 
discussed in section III.C.10. of this 
preamble, the Departments propose to 
add paragraph (b)(4)(vi) to require plans 
and issuers to post a Text File beginning 
on the first day of the calendar-year 
quarter following the applicability date 
under paragraph (c)(1) and subsequently 
update the Text File as soon as 
practicable but not later than 7 calendar 
days following a change in any of the 
information required under paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv) of this section. 
The Departments have observed and 
received feedback from interested 
parties that locating the files on a plan’s 
or issuer’s website can be difficult. To 
assist the public, CMS provided 
guidance on how to locate machine- 
readable files on the Transparency in 
Coverage website.
121
However, in 
considering how to improve both 
automated and non-automated access to 
the machine-readable files, the 
Departments have determined it is 
appropriate to require a standardized 
Text File at a consistent location 
(specifically, the root folder of the plan’s 
or issuer’s website), which would 
provide a direct link to the machine- 
readable files as opposed to the current 
approach of having to locate the correct 
web page within the website. If a plan 
or issuer does not have a website, they 
can satisfy this requirement by entering 
into a written agreement under which 
another party (such as a TPA) posts the 
Text File in the root folder on its public 
website on behalf of the plan or issuer 
pursuant to proposed paragraph 
(b)(3)(iv). 
Further, the Departments also 
received feedback regarding the 
difficulty of contacting plans and 
issuers to alert them to problems with 
their machine-readable files or to ask for 
additional information or clarifying 
context. Contact information for 
someone at the plan or issuer who is 
familiar with the details of the machine- 
readable files would allow the public to 
reach out for assistance with accessing 
or utilizing the machine-readable files. 
Therefore, the Departments propose to 
require the Text File to include plan or 
issuer point-of-contact information, who 
could help in verifying the contents of 
the machine-readable files and respond 
to requests for assistance related to 
accessing and utilizing the machine-

ViewICR?ref_nbr=202410-0938-006. readable files. The Departments also 
propose to require that the point-of- 
contact information be posted 
prominently on the same web page 
where the machine-readable files are 
located to further reduce the difficulty 
file users have faced in reaching out to 
plans and issuers for assistance. Under 
this proposal, and consistent with the 
flexibility described in redesignated 26 
CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(3)(iv), 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A3(b)(3)(iv), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(3)(iv), nothing would 
prevent a group health plan or health 
insurance issuer who contracts with a 
service provider to provide the 
machine-readable files on their behalf 
from listing the service provider as a 
point-of-contact. 
The Departments considered whether 
frequent changes to the host website 
could negate the benefit to automated 
access as well as impose burden in 
creating and maintaining this Text File. 
The Departments have determined that 
the benefits outweigh the drawbacks for 
having a plan or issuer ensure that the 
public website on which it chooses to 
host the machine-readable file includes 
a Text File in the root folder that 
includes a direct link to the machine- 
readable files to establish and maintain 
automated access. 
The Departments also propose these 
new requirements in accordance with 
Executive Order 14221 Section 3(b), 
which directs the Departments to ‘‘issue 
updated guidance or proposed 
regulatory action ensuring pricing 
information is standardized and easily 
comparable across hospitals and health 
plans.’’
122
CMS added new 
requirements to the 2019 Hospital Price 
Transparency rule
123
in the 2023 
Hospital Price Transparency rule.
124
 
The 2023 Hospital Price Transparency 
rule,
125
which went into effect on 
January 1, 2024, requires certain 
hospitals to include a Text File in the 
root folder of the hospital’s public 
website that includes a direct link to the 
hospital’s machine-readable file 
containing standard charge information 
and a link in the footer on its website 
that links directly to the publicly 
available web page that hosts the link to 
the machine-readable file. In proposing 
to adopt a similar requirement, the 
Departments would align this 
requirement with the 2023 Hospital 
Price Transparency rule
126
requirement 
to improve machine-readable file 
accessibility for the public. Based on 
feedback on this similar provision for 
the 2023 Hospital Price Transparency 
rule,
127
the Departments have 
determined this would be a relatively 
simple, low burden change, and that the 
increased benefits to the public 
outweigh the costs. 
The Departments request comment on 
all aspects of this proposal, and in 
particular on whether the Departments 
should issue guidance regarding 
whether any standards are required to 
ensure that the identified point-of- 
contact for plans and issuers is 
responsive to inquiries submitted by file 
users (such as a timeline to respond to 
inquiries or designated hours of 
availability for phone contact, and, if so, 
the recommended timeline and 
designated hours) or whether additional 
forms of contact (such as a physical 
address) are necessary. 
8. File Format 
The 2020 final rules at 26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A3(b)(2), 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A3(b)(2), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(2) (which the Departments 
are proposing to redesignate as 
paragraph (b)(3) per section III.C.9. of 
this preamble) state that the machine- 
readable files described in paragraph (b) 
must be available in the form and 
manner as specified in guidance issued 
by the Departments and must be 
publicly available and accessible free of 
charge and without conditions. 
In the 2020 final rules, the 
Departments clarified that this meant all 
machine-readable files must conform to 
a non-proprietary, open-standards 
format that is platform-independent and 
made available to the public without 
restrictions that would impede the re- 
use of the information.
128
 
The Departments are not including in 
these proposed rules any changes to the 
required format for disclosing 
information under paragraph (b). The 
Departments are, however, considering 
whether to indicate in either rulemaking 
or technical implementation guidance 
that the machine-readable files required 
under paragraph (b) must be published 
in a single, non-proprietary, open- 
standards format, and, if so, naming 
either JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) 
or Comma Separate Value(s) (CSV) as 
that single format in technical 
implementation guidance. As such, the 
Departments seek input from interested 
parties on such potential future 
rulemaking or technical implementation 
guidance. 
In the 2019 proposed rules, the 
Departments requested comment on 
whether the final rules should require a 
single, specific non-proprietary format 
for the machine-readable files, 
specifically JSON files.
129
The 
Departments noted that this format 
generally is easily downloadable, and it 
could simplify the ability of file users to 
access the data. The Departments 
received a comment in support of 
requiring JSON as the standardized file 
format for the required machine- 
readable files. However, in the 2020 
final rules, the Departments 
acknowledged that their internal 
technical experts agreed that the speed 
of technology developments weighs 
heavily in favor of maintaining 
flexibility to adopt a suitable file format 
as a non-substantive, operational 
requirement that will be identified in 
the relevant implementation guidance 
for the required machine-readable 
files.
130
In addition to maintaining the 
Departments’ flexibility, the 
Departments indicated in the 2020 final 
rules that being overly prescriptive 
regarding the file type would impose an 
unnecessary cost on issuers and service 
providers despite the advantages of 
JSON.
131
Therefore, the Departments 
did not require in the 2020 final rules 
one, specific non-proprietary open 
format. The Departments did, however, 
indicate that they would provide 
additional guidance regarding the file 
format in future technical 
implementation guidance.
132
 
When first developing machine- 
readable file guidance, the Departments 
considered various file formats that 
could satisfy the goals of the final rules, 
including hierarchical, tabular, and 
columnar formats. The technical 
implementation guidance hosted on 
GitHub includes a repository set of 
schemas describing the data formats 
(encoded as JSON, Extensible Markup 
Language (XML), and CSV). The 
technical implementation guidance was 
also published as part of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act (PRA) package developed 
for the Information Collection Requests 
(ICRs) included in the 2020 final 
rules.
133
To help plans and issuers 
understand the machine-readable file 
requirements, the Departments built a

JSON schema on the Transparency in 
Coverage GitHub site and provided 
samples in JSON and XML formats. 
After more than 3 years since the 
publication of the 2020 final rules’ 
machine-readable file requirements, the 
Departments have had time to analyze 
the landscape of plan and issuer file 
format use in published machine- 
readable files and have considered 
feedback from interested parties on the 
viability, benefits, and drawbacks of 
various file formats. Given that, based 
on internal analysis, over 90 percent of 
plans and issuers have chosen one 
format (that is, JSON), that initial 
flexibility regarding file type may no 
longer be needed, and to advance the 
goals in section 3(b) of Executive Order 
13877
134
to ensure pricing information 
is standardized and easily comparable 
across health plans, the Departments are 
now considering indicating in either 
rulemaking or technical implementation 
guidance that the machine-readable files 
required under paragraph (b)(1) must be 
published in a standard non-proprietary 
open format, as well as specifying the 
particular file format through technical 
implementation guidance. 
The Departments have received 
feedback in support of specifying either 
JSON or CSV formats. Both JSON and 
CSV formats have benefits and 
drawbacks, and each serves different 
audiences. JSON is a widely adopted 
industry standard that allows the 
machine-readable file data to be 
accessible to various users and 
adaptable to various use-cases. In the 
2020 final rules, the Departments noted 
that the machine-readable files’ primary 
benefit to health care consumers will be 
the availability of web-based tools and 
mobile applications developed for 
consumer use by third-party developers, 
aggregation, and analysis conducted by 
researchers, and oversight efforts by 
regulators. The required machine- 
readable files will be optimal for 
ingestion, data aggregation, and data 
analysis, all of which are functions 
performed by third-party internet-based 
developers, researchers, and regulators 
who use large data sets in a manner that 
will lead to benefits for consumers.’’
135
 
In the 3 years since the publication of 
the machine-readable file requirements, 
the Departments have observed the 
creation of a number of web-based tools 
developed for consumer use by third- 
party developers. These developers 
provided feedback on the benefits and 
drawbacks of various file formats but 
largely indicated a preference for using 
JSON due to its flexibility and 
adaptability. 
It is the Departments’ understanding 
that JSON’s suitability for the broad, 
high-volume disclosures required 
pursuant to the Transparency in 
Coverage rules stems in part from its 
ability to effectively handle different 
stages of the process by which raw data 
is transformed into more user-friendly 
outputs. This data process, known as 
Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL), 
begins with raw data gathered 
(‘‘extracted’’) from a range of sources; 
then cleaned and standardized 
(‘‘transformed’’) into a selected format; 
and then loaded into a repository or 
database for subsequent uses (and 
ultimately, for downstream analysis). 
Different file formats are best suited for 
different stages of the ETL process. An 
optimal file format for the machine- 
readable files would accurately 
represent the data’s underlying 
relationships through the file format’s 
organizational structure, ensure efficient 
storage and processing of the data, and 
make the data accessible to a variety of 
users with diverse use cases. As applied 
to the machine-readable files, JSON’s 
strength is its capacity to handle all 
stages of the ETL process. It is also 
lightweight and effective for the 
extraction step from raw data, and it is 
highly flexible for both the initial 
transformation step and subsequent 
transformation of machine-readable file 
data by downstream users. The 
widespread use of JSON for the 
machine-readable files is expected given 
the advantages of JSON in the data 
extraction stage, and in efficiently 
representing the underlying complex 
relationships in machine-readable file 
data. Additionally, JSON is widely 
adopted by industry and government as 
a common means of data exchanges, and 
enjoys native support for most 
programming languages, meaning that 
these languages and tools already 
‘‘speak’’ JSON, limiting the time and 
effort required to work with JSON- 
formatted files. 
The Departments have also received 
feedback that many file users, especially 
researchers, prefer to work with the 
machine-readable file data in CSV 
format due to its relative simplicity and 
accessibility, and that they migrate the 
data from JSON to CSV in order to 
conduct analyses. For example, CSV 
files can include a header row 
specifying the titles of each subsequent 
column in the file for visual simplicity. 
CSV files are highly portable and can be 
loaded into commonly used tools that 
do not require engineering capability 
such as Microsoft Excel and may be a 
more familiar format to a wider 
audience than JSON. 
The Departments recognize that both 
of these file formats have limitations. A 
JSON format requires users to have 
some data engineering sophistication to 
interact with the machine-readable files 
directly—capabilities and resources that 
many individuals and organizations 
may not have. Additionally, working 
with JSON may require more computing 
resources than some other formats to 
process. Other file formats may have 
attributes that suit the needs of certain 
users of the machine-readable files 
better than JSON does. However, the 
drawback with using CSV or any row- 
based tabular flat file structure for 
machine-readable file publishing and 
consumption of the amount of data that 
is being generated pursuant to the 
Transparency in Coverage requirements 
is that it makes it challenging for a file 
user with a standard personal computer 
to load and work with it effectively. For 
example, those opening large CSV 
machine-readable files in Microsoft 
Excel will encounter the software’s 
limitations in how many rows of data 
can be opened and will often crash the 
program.
136
Most significantly, the flat 
structure of CSV files would force 
publishers to create numerous columns 
where the same data values would be 
repeated up to millions of times per file, 
which is both inefficient and 
impractical given current file size 
concerns by interested parties. 
As explained, the Departments are 
now strongly considering specifying a 
single, non-proprietary open format in 
technical implementation guidance. 
Specifying the file format in technical 
implementation guidance would reduce 
flexibility for plans and issuers in 
selecting alternate file formats but 
would further standardize reporting of 
critical health care pricing information. 
The Departments are of the view that 
specifying a single format presents an 
important part of fully realizing the 
goals of price transparency and 
Executive Orders 13877 and 14221.
137
 
The Departments seek comment on 
specifying a single, non-proprietary 
open-source format for the machine- 
readable files and on the relevant 
benefits and burdens associated with 
the CSV and JSON formats. The 
Departments also seek comment on the

indicates that the server understood the request but 
refused to process it.’’) 
Departments’ position that specifying a 
single format in technical 
implementation guidance, as opposed to 
regulation, is advisable to maintain 
maximum flexibility to change formats 
more quickly to keep pace with 
technological changes. 
Additionally, in recognition of the 
developments of electronic data transfer 
systems since the publication of the 
2020 final rules and in anticipation of 
future developments of new 
technologies, the Departments are 
revisiting the request for comment made 
in the 2019 proposed rules regarding a 
requirement that plans and issuers 
provide rate information through a 
publicly accessible API that would 
comply with standards defined by the 
Departments.
138
In light of the 
publication of the CMS Interoperability 
and Prior Authorization Final Rule,
139
 
the Departments seek comment on 
whether the required information in 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) should be 
required to be disclosed through an 
electronic data transfer technology, such 
as a publicly accessible API, as well as 
what standards should apply. The 
Departments also seek comment on 
whether the use of a standards-based 
API would benefit consumers, 
developers of consumer-facing 
applications, and other entities seeking 
to access this data. 
9. Required Method and Format for 
Disclosing Information to the Public 
As discussed in section III.C.7. of this 
preamble, the Departments propose to 
redesignate paragraphs (b)(2) through (3) 
of 26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3, 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A3, and 45 CFR 147.212 
as paragraphs (b)(3) and (4), 
respectively. The Departments propose 
to add paragraph (iii) to redesignated 
paragraph (b)(3) to require that the 
source page URL for the internet website 
that hosts the machine-readable files 
required by paragraph (b)(1) and new 
paragraph (b)(2) must be included as a 
link in the footer on the home page of 
the group health plan’s or health 
insurance issuer’s website, as well as 
any page of the website that features a 
footer, that is labeled ‘‘Price 
Transparency’’ or ‘‘Transparency in 
Coverage’’ and links directly to the 
publicly available web page that hosts 
the link to the machine-readable files.
140
 
Additionally, in redesignating 
paragraph (b)(2) as paragraph (b)(3), the 
Departments propose to make three 
changes: first, the Departments propose 
to divide the existing language in 
paragraph (b)(2) into two paragraphs at 
redesignated paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and 
(ii); second, the Departments propose to 
indicate that the machine-readable files 
in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) (instead of 
paragraph (b) generally as currently 
written) must be available in a form and 
manner as specified in guidance issued 
by the Departments; and third, the 
Departments propose to amend 
redesignated paragraph (b)(3)(ii) to 
ensure that the machine-readable files 
remain publicly accessible to automated 
scripts and web crawlers as well as 
human users and that blocking server 
configurations or firewalls cannot be 
used to impede access. The Departments 
also propose to add paragraph (iv) at 
redesignated 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(3), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(3), and 45 CFR 147.212(b)(3), 
allowing a group health plan or health 
insurance issuer to satisfy the disclosure 
requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) by 
entering into a written agreement under 
which another party posts the machine- 
readable files on its public website on 
behalf of the plan or issuer. However, if 
the files are posted on a service 
provider’s website and the plan or 
issuer maintains a public website but 
chooses not to host the files separately 
on its own public website, it must 
provide a link on its own public website 
to the location where the files are made 
publicly available. This requirement 
applies to a public website maintained 
by the plan or issuer and does not apply 
to a public website maintained by an 
employer or plan sponsor. 
The 2020 final rules at 26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A3(b)(2), 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A3(b)(2), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(2) require plans and issuers 
to make the machine-readable files 
described in paragraph (b) of that 
section available and accessible to any 
person on a public website in a form 
and manner as specified in guidance 
issued by the Departments. In the 2020 
final rules, the Departments finalized 
the proposal to allow plans and issuers 
flexibility to publish the files in the 
locations of their choosing based upon 
their knowledge of their website traffic 
and the places on their website where 
the machine-readable files would be 
readily accessible by the intended 
users.
141
As discussed in section III.C.7. 
of this preamble, the Departments have 
observed and received feedback from 
interested parties that locating the files 
on a plan’s or issuer’s website can be 
difficult and that there are occasional 
obstacles to automated and human 
access. 
Therefore, the Departments have 
determined that they should require the 
addition of standardized hyperlinks in 
the footer of a plan’s or issuer’s website 
home page, as well as any other page on 
their website that features a footer, in 
order to aid file users in the automated 
and non-automated retrieval of 
machine-readable files by creating a 
predictable navigation path to internal 
web pages that host the machine- 
readable files posted pursuant to the 
Transparency in Coverage requirements. 
Additionally, the Departments propose 
to amend the existing requirement that 
the machine-readable files described in 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) must be 
publicly available and accessible to any 
person free of charge and without 
conditions, to specify that they must be 
publicly available and accessible to any 
person, automated scripts, or web 
crawlers free of charge and without 
conditions such as establishment of a 
user account, password, submission of 
personally identifiable information or 
other credentials, or blocking server 
configurations or firewalls to access the 
file. Requiring the machine-readable 
files to be available to both human and 
automated users more directly aligns 
with the purpose of the files being 
machine-readable. Examples of 
conditions include a ‘‘captcha,’’
142
a 
403 error,
143
or limits on the number of 
downloads allowed by a user or at a 
time. 
Once a human user or automated web 
crawler arrives at the website of the plan 
or issuer, they would be able to identify 
the specific location of the files. The 
Departments have determined that 
making this information more easily 
accessible to automated searches and 
data aggregation would help third 
parties to develop tools that further 
assist the public in understanding this 
information and capturing it in a 
meaningful way for making informed 
health care decisions. Moreover, the 
Departments have determined that this 
requirement would be simple for plans 
and issuers to implement, because plans

and issuers commonly link to other 
information in their website footer. In 
addition, using a standardized label for 
the link in the footer would make the 
location of the machine-readable files 
easier to identify by individual 
consumers manually searching for such 
files. 
Both this proposed requirement and 
the proposed contextual machine- 
readable Text File as discussed in 
section III.C.7.d. of this preamble, are 
intended to improve both automated 
and manual location of the machine- 
readable files on a plan’s or issuer’s 
website. While the Text File will 
enhance automated searching more so 
than manual searching, the footer links 
would assist manual searching more so 
than automated searching as individuals 
are likely to first examine a footer for 
web page navigation. Thus, these 
proposed requirements would 
complement each other and improve 
overall accessibility. 
Additionally, for a plan or issuer that 
does not have a public website, the 
Departments have determined that it 
would be overly burdensome to require 
such plan or issuer to create and 
maintain a website to satisfy this 
requirement. Therefore, the 
Departments also propose to add 
paragraph (iv) at redesignated 26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A3(b)(3), 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A3(b)(3), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(3), in line with guidance 
issued on April 19, 2022 in FAQs Part 
55,
144
but extended to apply to issuers, 
such that any plan or issuer may satisfy 
the disclosure requirements of 
paragraph (b)(3)(iii) by entering into a 
written agreement under which another 
party posts the machine-readable files 
on its public website on behalf of the 
plan or issuer. Additionally, if the files 
are hosted on a service provider’s 
website, and the plan or issuer does 
maintain a public website and chooses 
not to also post the files separately on 
its own public website, it must provide 
a link on its own public website to the 
location where the files are made 
publicly available. This requirement 
applies to a public website maintained 
by the plan or issuer and does not apply 
to a public website maintained by an 
employer or plan sponsor. This 
proposed new paragraph also moves 
part of current 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(4)(iii), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(4)(iii), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(4)(iii) addressing plans or 
issuers who do not have a website to 
new paragraph (b)(3)(iv) for clarity and 
alignment with other proposed changes. 
The Departments recognize that many 
employer-sponsored ERISA plans do not 
currently maintain a separate dedicated 
internet page for their group health 
plans or have an internet website at all. 
This proposed new paragraph would 
codify FAQs Part 55
145
and extend it to 
apply to issuers, and recognize the 
hardship for impacted group health 
plans, especially for smaller employers. 
The Departments are proposing this 
extension to issuers because they were 
not covered under the guidance in FAQs 
Part 55 and this would make the 
requirements consistent across all 
entities subject to the requirements of 
paragraph (b)(3)(iii). 
The Departments also propose to 
amend paragraph (b)(3)(i) at 
redesignated 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(3), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(3), and 45 CFR 147.212(b)(3) 
to require that the proposed method and 
format requirements for disclosing 
information to the public would apply 
to both the machine-readable files under 
paragraph (b)(1) and the contextual 
machine-readable files under new 
paragraph (b)(2). 
Finally, as with the public disclosure 
requirements in the 2020 final rules, the 
Departments intend to continue to issue 
form and manner requirements for the 
machine-readable files specified in 
technical guidance in the form of 
sample file schemas and data attributes 
on GitHub.
146
The technical guidance 
for the machine-readable files, in the 
form of schemas,
147
will be updated 
when appropriate as the Departments 
receive feedback from the community 
and interested parties. Additionally, 
guidance on applicability timelines for 
new schema requirements and 
implementation of policy requirements 
will continue to be posted in the form 
of Frequently Asked Questions.
148
Table 
2 summarizes the technical guidance 
documents that the Departments expect 
to publish pursuant to the finalization of 
these proposed rules. The Departments 
encourage interested parties to submit 
all questions and issues on GitHub, as 
it enables a centralized response and 
helps to efficiently identify and address 
common concerns across interested 
parties.

The Departments seek comment on 
these proposals. 
10. Timing 
Under 26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(4), 
29 CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(4), and 45 
CFR 147.212(b)(4) (proposed to be 
redesignated from paragraph (b)(3), as 
discussed in section III.C.7. of this 
preamble), the Departments propose to 
add new paragraphs to specify timing 
requirements for each machine-readable 
file that would be required under these 
proposed rules. With respect to the In- 
network Rate Files and Allowed 
Amount Files under paragraph (b)(1)(i) 
and (ii), the Departments propose to 
amend the publication frequency under 
new paragraph (b)(4)(i), from a 
requirement to post monthly to 
quarterly. 
The Departments also propose to add 
disclosure timing requirements for the 
new contextual machine-readable files 
that would be required under proposed 
new paragraph (b)(2) at new paragraphs 
(b)(4)(iii) through (vi) under 
redesignated paragraph (b)(4). The 
Departments note that the first machine- 
readable files prepared based upon 
these proposed rules would be required 
to be disclosed according to the 
applicability date as proposed at 
paragraph (c)(1) and discussed in 
section III.C.12. of this preamble, which 
is 12 months after the publication of the 
final rules. These proposed rules also 
specify the timing for each machine- 
readable file to be updated thereafter 
and example dates are shown in Table 
3. 
In particular, the Departments 
propose to amend redesignated 
paragraph (b)(4)(i) to require plans and 
issuers to update and post the In- 
network Rate and Allowed Amount 
Files required under paragraphs (b)(1)(i) 
and (ii), respectively, quarterly rather 
than monthly and beginning on the first 
day of the calendar-year quarter 
following the applicability date under 
paragraph (c)(1). The Departments have 
received feedback from both producers 
and users of the machine-readable files 
recommending reducing the reporting 
frequency to quarterly, to help lower 
data storage and hosting costs, decrease 
bandwidth needs, and reduce ongoing 
maintenance expenses. The 
Departments have received feedback 
that a reduced reporting cadence may 
also provide more time to analyze the 
data,
149
as some file users have 
informed the Departments that they 
have difficulty keeping up with the pace 
of downloading and ingesting the file 
data monthly. 
With respect to In-network Rate File 
data, interested parties have indicated 
that negotiated rates between issuers 
and health care organizations (for 
example, hospital systems)—in contrast 
to individual providers—tend to change 
slowly over time because contracts 
generally last a year or more, with some 
multi-year contracts lasting 2 to 5 years. 
As such, the Departments have 
determined negotiated rates between 
health care organizations and issuers 
should not significantly change from 
month to month, so the proposed 
quarterly reporting cadence would not 
meaningfully affect the accuracy of 
reported rates in the In-network Rate 
File for these entities. 
The Departments acknowledge that 
the accuracy of rates at the individual 
provider level are more likely to be 
affected by the proposed quarterly 
reporting cadence, though not 
significantly. The Departments 
understand that individual providers 
can regularly move in and out of 
relationships with the institutions that 
employ them (for example, hospital 
systems, group medical practices);
150
 
thus, reported rates at the individual 
provider level may be less accurate with 
a change from monthly to quarterly 
reporting. More specifically, the 
turnover of individual providers within 
the roster of a large provider 
organization (like specialist physicians 
associated with a hospital system) 
means that the reporting of negotiated 
rates that ‘‘flow down’’ to the individual 
providers might become increasingly 
out of date, given a longer cadence for 
the reporting requirement. One recent 
study that quantified physician turnover 
rates due to retirements and shifts in 
practice affiliations suggested an annual 
turnover rate of 7.6 percent in 2018.
151
 
Given that this relatively low annual 
percentage would translate to an even 
smaller quarterly turnover rate, the 
Departments have determined that 
under the proposed change in reporting 
cadence, negotiated rates for individual 
providers would likely become only 
somewhat less accurate because there 
would be more providers who terminate 
employment with their parent 
organizations during the extended 
reporting interval. 
Notwithstanding the potential for 
some of the data in the files to be less 
accurate, particularly with respect to 
individual providers, the Departments 
expect the benefits of quarterly 
reporting to outweigh these potential 
limitations, given that for the majority of 
use cases for the In-network Rate Files, 
the proposed change in reporting 
cadence would have only minimal 
impact on the ability to use the data for 
reasonable analytic purposes and would 
significantly reduce burdens both on 
producers and file users. For example, 
for a file user that analyzes aggregated 
rates between plans or issuers and 
health care organizations and compares 
reimbursement for orthopedic services 
in the same geographic market between 
two issuers, the impact of individual 
providers (who all share the same rates) 
moving in and out of health care 
systems would be immaterial. 
The Departments request comment on 
the benefits, drawbacks, and potential 
impact of the proposed change in 
reporting cadence for the In-network 
Rate Files. 
The Departments have also 
determined there would be no loss in 
data value by changing the reporting 
cadence from monthly to quarterly for 
the Allowed Amount File under 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) since the data 
represents a historical snapshot that 
would continue to be captured in its 
entirety. The Departments seek 
comment on the potential impact of the 
proposed change in reporting cadence 
for the Allowed Amount File. 
The Departments are not proposing to 
change the monthly reporting cadence 
for the prescription drug machine- 
readable file under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) 
in proposed paragraph (b)(4)(ii). 
With respect to the proposals to 
require new contextual files under new 
paragraph (b)(2), the Departments 
intend for them to be updated at a 
frequency at which they will be 
maximally useful and provide the most 
context to the In-network Rate File and 
Allowed Amount File. The Departments 
have determined that since the Change- 
log File serves as a reference to an In- 
network Rate File, it should be posted 
at the same time as the In-network Rate 
File to show what has changed from an 
In-network Rate File since it was last 
updated. Therefore, the Departments 
propose to require at proposed 
paragraph (b)(4)(iii) that plans and 
issuers update the Change-log File 
under proposed paragraph (b)(2)(i) on

the same day as each In-network Rate 
File described in (b)(1)(i) is required to 
be updated, except for the first In- 
network Rate File for which there would 
be no changes to report. This would 
mean the plan or issuer would be 
required to post their first Change-log 
File beginning on the first day of the 
calendar-year quarter following the date 
on which the first In-network Rate File 
would be required to be posted under 
paragraph (b)(4)(i).
152
The Departments 
propose to require that if there are no 
changes to an In-network Rate File since 
it was updated last, a Change-log File 
would still be required to be posted at 
that time indicating there are no 
changes for that quarter. 
The Departments also propose to 
require at proposed paragraph (b)(4)(iv) 
that the Utilization File described in 
proposed new paragraph (b)(2)(ii) be 
updated and posted every 12 months 
after the initial posting. The Utilization 
File would be required to be initially 
posted on the first day of the calendar- 
year quarter following the applicability 
date under paragraph (c)(1) and 
annually on the same date thereafter. 
The Departments have determined that 
an annual cadence for this file is 
sufficient to illustrate provider 
reimbursement for corresponding items 
and services and appropriately balances 
the benefit of having recent historical 
data with the burden on plans and 
issuers to extract data from their claims 
systems annually. 
The Departments also propose to 
require at proposed paragraph (b)(4)(v) 
that plans and issuers update the 
Taxonomy File prepared pursuant to 
proposed paragraph (b)(2)(iii) and post 
such file beginning on the first day of 
the calendar-year quarter following the 
applicability date under paragraph 
(c)(1). This would help to ensure file 
users have all necessary information to 
assess the data disclosed through the In- 
network Rate Files as described under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) and to provide clarity 
around what data was excluded from 
the In-network Rate Files pursuant to 
the new proposed requirement to 
exclude certain information under new 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(F). If there are no 
changes to the taxonomy that impact the 
information required to be included in 
the In-network Rate File from one 
quarter to the next, the posted 
Taxonomy File would not be required to 
be updated. 
The Departments also propose in new 
paragraph (b)(4)(vi) to require that the 
Text File required under proposed 
paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section be 
initially posted on the first day of the 
calendar-year quarter following the 
applicability date under paragraph (c)(1) 
and updated and posted as soon as 
practicable but no later than 7 calendar 
days following a change in any of the 
information required under paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv). The Departments request 
comment on all aspects of these 
proposed timing requirements. In 
particular, the Departments request 
comment on whether the proposed 
requirement that plans and issuers 
update the Text File as soon as 
practicable but not later than 7 calendar 
days following a change in any of the 
information required under paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv) of this section provides 
sufficient time for plans and issuers to 
make the required update. 
The Departments seek comment on 
these proposed timing requirements. 
11. Special Rules To Prevent 
Unnecessary Duplication 
The Departments propose in 26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A3, 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3, and 45 CFR 147.212 to 
redesignate paragraph (b)(4)(i) as 
paragraph (b)(5)(i) and redesignate 
paragraph (b)(4)(ii) as paragraph

For the purposes of this section III.C.11, the 
term ‘‘health insurance market’’ refers to the 
definition in proposed 25 CFR 54.9815–2715A1, 29 
CFR 2590.715.2715A1, and 45 CFR 147.210 as 
described in section III.A of these proposed rules. 
(b)(5)(ii)—each without any substantive 
changes to the existing policy in the 
2020 final rules. The Departments also 
propose to redesignate and amend 
paragraph (b)(4)(iii), which permits 
aggregation of out-of-network allowed 
amounts in certain circumstances, as 
paragraph (b)(5)(iv) and to add new 
paragraph (b)(5)(iii) to include similar 
permissions with respect to in-network 
rates. 
In new paragraph (b)(5)(iii), the 
Departments propose, under certain 
conditions, to allow self-insured group 
health plans to permit another party 
(pursuant to a contract) to make 
available in a single In-network Rate 
File, the information required under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) for multiple plans, 
insurance policies, and contracts, 
including those offered by different plan 
sponsors with which the other party 
contracts and across markets that share 
the same provider network.
153
 
Similarly, in redesignated paragraph 
(b)(5)(iv), the Departments propose 
amendments that would allow, under 
certain conditions, self-insured group 
health plans to permit another party 
(pursuant to a contract) to make 
available in a single Allowed Amount 
File the information required under 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) for more than one 
self-insured group health plan, 
including those offered by different plan 
sponsors with which the other party 
contracts. The Departments also propose 
two amendments to redesignated 
paragraph (b)(5)(iv) to account for 
proposed amendments to the Allowed 
Amount File requirements in paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii): (1) to require that the 
minimum claims threshold apply across 
multiple self-insured group health plans 
whose information is included in a 
single Allowed Amount File, as 
described in proposed paragraph 
(b)(5)(iv), rather than for each such 
individual self-insured group health 
plan, and (2) to revise the minimum 
claims threshold to 11-claims in 
accordance with proposed paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii)(C). Lastly, the Departments 
propose amendments to better organize 
and streamline requirements in 
redesignated paragraph (b)(5)(iv) which 
do not affect any substantive rights or 
obligations. 
a. Special Rule for Self-Insured Group 
Health Plans With Respect to the 
Disclosure of In-Network Rate Files 
In new paragraph (b)(5)(iii), the 
Departments propose to permit In- 
network Rate Files, which for self- 
insured group health plans under the 
proposed amendments to paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) would have been required to be 
made available at the plan sponsor 
level, to instead be made available at the 
service provider level for each provider 
network used by the self-insured group 
health plan. This In-network Rate File 
could include such information for 
more than one self-insured group health 
plan with which the other party has an 
agreement, as well as other policies and 
contracts offered by the other party 
acting as a health insurance issuer, that 
uses the same provider network. This 
In-network Rate File may also include 
the relevant information from plans or 
coverage in different health insurance 
markets, as described below. 
As discussed in section III.C.1 of this 
preamble, the Departments propose to 
amend paragraph (b)(1)(i) to require 
plans and issuers to make an In-network 
Rate File available for each provider 
network maintained or contracted by 
the plan or issuer. This organization by 
provider network would reduce file size 
and the overall number of files and 
make more meaningful information 
available to file users. Under this 
proposal, each self-insured group health 
plan would be required to make 
available an In-network Rate File for 
each provider network it maintains. For 
self-insured group health plans that are 
administered by the same service 
provider and use the same provider 
network, this approach would require 
duplicate In-network Rate Files that 
include the same negotiated rates under 
the same provider network for each self- 
insured group health plan using that 
network. Therefore, to further the goals 
of reducing duplicative rates and 
simplifying analysis for file users, the 
Departments propose in paragraph 
(b)(5)(iii) to permit and encourage self- 
insured group health plans to allow 
another party with which they contract, 
such as a service provider, to make 
available an In-network Rate File for 
each provider network used by more 
than one self-insured plan. 
Further, the Departments propose that 
these In-network Rate Files may include 
information about plans, insurance 
policies, and contracts across health 
insurance markets, since a service 
provider may use the same provider 
network for multiple self-insured group 
health plans it administers and also for 
multiple fully-insured group health 
plans or individual health insurance 
coverage it offers as a health insurance 
issuer. Such a service provider, when 
acting as a health insurance issuer, 
would already be required under the 
Departments’ proposed amendments to 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) to disclose an In- 
network Rate File for that provider 
network that includes negotiated rate 
information for the fully-insured group 
health plans it offers across the small 
group and large group markets, as well 
as any individual policies it offers in the 
individual market, to the extent those 
plans or policies use that same provider 
network. Under new paragraph 
(b)(5)(iii), a self-insured group health 
plan could permit its service provider to 
include plans and coverage offered in 
different health insurance markets in 
the same In-network Rate File, to the 
extent they use the same provider 
network. If this In-network Rate File 
includes the required rates for 
individual and group health insurance 
coverage offered by the issuer, the issuer 
would also be considered to comply 
with the Departments’ proposed 
amendments to paragraph (b)(1)(i). 
The Departments also propose to add 
new paragraphs (b)(5)(iii)(A) and (B) to 
include two conditions on the 
applicability of the special rule for self- 
insured group health plans with respect 
to the disclosure of the In-network Rate 
File. In new paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A), the 
Departments propose that a self-insured 
group health plan may only avail itself 
of the special rule described in (b)(5)(iii) 
if each In-network Rate File made 
available for a provider network 
includes information for all covered 
items and services under each plan, 
insurance policy, or contract that uses 
the same provider network for which 
the In-network Rate File is made 
available, consistent with the 
requirements for disclosing rate 
information under proposed (b)(1)(i). 
In new paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(B), the 
Departments propose that a self-insured 
group health plan may only use the 
special rule described in (b)(5)(iii) if 
each proposed Change-log, Utilization, 
and Taxonomy File (all of which must 
be made available for each In-network 
Rate File, as discussed in section III.C.7. 
of this preamble, under proposed new 
paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii) and (iii), 
respectively), include data from the 
same plans, insurance policies, or 
contracts (including those offered by 
different plan sponsors and across 
different health insurance markets, if 
applicable) that are represented in the 
corresponding In-network Rate File. 
This is because, as discussed in section 
III.C.7. of this preamble, for the Change- 
log, Utilization, and Taxonomy Files to 
be meaningful, they must directly 
correspond to the disclosures in the In- 
network Rate Files for which they are 
made available. Under this proposal, a 
self-insured group health plan that 
contracts with another party that takes

advantage of the special rule would not 
be permitted to publish (either itself or 
by contracting with another party) the 
corresponding Change-log, Utilization, 
and Taxonomy Files only with respect 
to its own plans. 
b. Special Rule for Self-Insured Group 
Health Plans With Respect to the 
Disclosure of Out-of-Network Allowed 
Amount Files 
As described above, the Departments 
propose in 26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3, 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3, and 45 CFR 
147.212 to redesignate paragraph 
(b)(4)(iii) as paragraph (b)(5)(iv), and to 
amend redesignated paragraph (b)(5)(iv) 
to state that a self-insured group health 
plan may permit another party with 
which it contracts, such as a service 
provider, to include the required 
allowed amount and billed charge 
information in a single Allowed 
Amount File for more than one self- 
insured group health plan, including 
those offered by different plan sponsors 
with which the other party contracts, 
provided certain conditions are met. 
For improved readability, the 
Departments propose to move the 
condition currently described in 
paragraph (b)(4)(iii) (related to 
application of the claims threshold to 
the Allowed Amount File) into new 
paragraph (b)(5)(iv) and to amend it to 
align with the Departments’ proposed 
revisions to the claims threshold in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii). 
Under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of the 2020 
final rules, group health plans and 
health insurance issuers are currently 
permitted to satisfy the Allowed 
Amount File disclosure requirements in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) by contracting with 
an issuer, service provider, or other 
party to make available out-of-network 
allowed amount data that has been 
aggregated to include information from 
more than one plan, policy, or contract 
(provided that the claims threshold 
described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) is 
met independently for each item or 
service and for each plan or coverage 
included in an aggregated Allowed 
Amount File). These plans, policies, or 
contracts may be across multiple health 
insurance markets. 
As discussed in section III.C.6 of this 
preamble, the Departments now propose 
to amend paragraph (b)(1)(ii) to require 
all plans and issuers to aggregate out-of- 
network allowed amount data across the 
plans or coverage they offer in each 
health insurance market. For example, 
an issuer offering six plans in the small 
group market and four in the individual 
market would be required to make 
available two Allowed Amount Files: 
one that aggregates allowed amounts 
across the issuer’s six small group 
market plans and another that 
aggregates allowed amounts across its 
four individual market plans. 
Therefore, if proposed (b)(1)(ii) were 
finalized and current paragraph 
(b)(4)(iii) were retained, plans and 
issuers would be required to aggregate 
out-of-network allowed amount data 
across the plans or coverage they offer 
in each health insurance market, and, if 
a plan or issuer contracts with an issuer, 
service provider or other party to satisfy 
the disclosure requirement of (b)(1)(ii), 
such party would additionally be 
permitted to aggregate allowed amount 
data across the plans or coverage in 
different health insurance markets. 
Permitting plans and issuers to 
aggregate data within a health insurance 
market and then again across multiple 
different health insurance markets 
would undermine the Departments’ goal 
of improving data useability of the 
Allowed Amount Files as discussed in 
section III.C.6 of this preamble. 
As discussed in section III.A. of this 
preamble, the Departments propose to 
add new paragraphs 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A1(a)(2)(xi), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A1(a)(2)(x), and 45 CFR 
147.210(a)(2)(xi) to define health 
insurance markets for purposes of the 
proposed amendments to the Allowed 
Amount File at proposed paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii). If finalized as proposed, for 
purposes of self-insured group health 
plans (other than account-based plans, 
as defined in 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2711(d)(6)(i), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2711(d)(6)(i), and 45 CFR 
147.126(d)(6)(i) of this subchapter, and 
plans that consist solely of excepted 
benefits), health insurance market 
would be defined as all self-insured 
group health plans maintained by the 
plan sponsor. Therefore, proposed 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) would require self- 
insured group health plans to aggregate 
out-of-network allowed amount data 
across the plans offered by the same 
plan sponsor (that is, in the same health 
insurance market), but would not permit 
aggregation across more than one plan 
sponsor. The Departments have 
determined that allowing aggregation of 
allowed amount data only across self- 
insured group health plans offered by 
different plan sponsors maintains the 
market division grouping necessary to 
make the data more actionable for 
research and analysis as discussed in 
section III.C.6 of this preamble. As such, 
proposed paragraph (b)(5)(iv) states that 
a self-insured group health plan that 
enters into an agreement with another 
party described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) 
may permit such other party to make 
available the information required 
under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) in a single 
out-of-network allowed amount file for 
more than one self-insured group health 
plan, including those offered by 
different plan sponsors with which the 
other party contracts. This would mean 
that a self-insured group health plan 
may permit their service provider or 
other party with which they contract to 
include their required allowed amount 
and billed charges information in a 
single Allowed Amount File along with 
allowed amount and billed charges 
information from more than one self- 
insured group health plan, including 
those offered by different plan sponsors 
(that is, in different health insurance 
markets). Therefore, the Departments 
propose to limit the application of 
redesignated paragraph (b)(5)(iv) to self- 
insured group health plans; allowed 
amounts and billed charges from fully- 
insured group health plans or 
individual market coverage must not be 
included. 
In addition, in new paragraph 
(b)(5)(iv), the Departments propose that 
a self-insured group health plan may not 
take advantage of the special rule under 
paragraph (b)(5)(iv) unless the proposed 
11-claim threshold applies across all 
plans included in the Allowed Amount 
File. Under current paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii)(C), plans and issuers must 
apply the minimum claims threshold by 
evaluating the number of different 
claims for payments under a single plan 
or coverage. Under current paragraph 
(b)(4)(iii), when allowed amount data is 
aggregated at the service provider level, 
rather than reported by plan, policy, or 
contract, the minimum claims threshold 
is applied the same way: it must be met 
independently for each item or service 
and for each plan, insurance policy, or 
coverage included in an aggregated 
Allowed Amount File.
154
 
The Departments finalized this 
requirement in the 2020 final rules 
because if the threshold were applied to 
the aggregated claims data at the service 
provider level, rather than for each plan 
or coverage as is required under current 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C), the Departments 
determined that the goal of the 
minimum claims threshold could be 
undermined.
155
The Departments gave 
the following example in the 2020 rules: 
‘‘Plan A has 20 claims for Service X, 
while Plan B only has six claims for 
Service X. In aggregate, the plans meet 
the 20-claim threshold with 26 total 
claims for Service X. However, 
individually, only Plan A has met the

Id. 
minimum claim threshold.’’
156
If the 
claims threshold were applied to the 
aggregated data set, data for Service X 
would be required to be included from 
both Plan A and Plan B. The 
Departments determined that ‘‘allowing 
Plan B data to be included in the file for 
Service X would undermine the 
minimum claim threshold, increasing 
risk that individual patients’ claims 
histories could be identified.’’
157
 
As discussed in section III.C.6. of this 
preamble, the Departments now propose 
in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) to lower the 
claims threshold from 20 to 11 and 
apply it at the health insurance market 
level, rather than the individual plan or 
policy level. That is, plans and issuers 
would be required to exclude claims 
data for an item or service if there are 
fewer than 11 claims for that item or 
service in an Allowed Amount File, 
regardless of how many plans, 
insurance policies, or contracts are 
represented in the file. 
For consistency in the application of 
the claims threshold, the Departments 
propose in new paragraph (b)(5)(iv) that 
in order for a self-insured group health 
plan to take advantage of the special 
rule under paragraph (b)(5)(iv), the 
proposed 11-claim threshold must be 
applied to the aggregated data set. 
Applying the threshold to aggregated 
data, especially when aggregated across 
multiple self-insured group health plans 
offered by different plan sponsors, 
would likely increase the amount of 
allowed amount data available because 
more services would likely exceed the 
11-claim threshold. Notwithstanding, 
and as discussed in more detail in 
section III.C.6. of this preamble, the 
Departments expect this approach 
would result in maintaining appropriate 
patient privacy protections. 
Finally, the Departments propose to 
revise the paragraph heading for 
redesignated paragraph (b)(5)(iv) to 
better describe the proposed 
requirements in this paragraph. 
c. Better Organizing Existing 
Requirements 
Current paragraph (b)(4)(iii), 
redesignated as paragraph (b)(5)(iv), also 
provides that nothing in 26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A3, 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3, and 45 CFR 147.212 prevents 
the Allowed Amount File from being 
hosted on a third-party website or 
prevents a plan administrator or issuer 
from contracting with a service provider 
to post the file, but that if a plan or 
issuer chooses not to also host the file 
separately on its own website, it must 
provide a link on its own public website 
to the location where the file is made 
publicly available. The Departments 
have determined that this provision 
more logically belongs in redesignated 
paragraph (b)(3) concerning the method 
and format for disclosing information to 
the public. As such, the Departments 
propose to move it to new paragraph 
(b)(3)(iv) with proposed amendments 
that are discussed in section III.C.9. of 
this preamble. 
The Departments seek comment on 
these proposals. 
12. Applicability 
The Departments propose to require 
under paragraph (c)(1)that the proposed 
amendments to the provisions of 
paragraph (b) of 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3, 29 CFR 2590.715–2715A3, and 
45 CFR 147.212 apply 12 months 
following the date of publication of the 
final regulations in the Federal Register. 
The Departments are proposing this 
applicability date to ensure that all 
plans and issuers begin following the 
updated set of technical requirements at 
the same time. Until such time, the 
current provisions of paragraph (b) 
continue to apply. 
Based on initial implementation 
experience, the Departments have 
determined that the proposed 
applicability date appropriately 
balances the need for achieving 
increased usability of the machine- 
readable file data in a timely manner 
with the time necessary for both file 
developers and other users to 
collaborate with the Departments on 
GitHub and for plans and issuers to 
make the operational and systems 
changes to implement these proposals. 
The Departments seek comment on 
this proposed applicability date, 
including whether 12 months following 
publication of final regulations provides 
enough time for plans and issuers to 
comply with the amended provisions of 
paragraph (b) and whether there are 
particular challenges in complying with 
such applicability date compared to an 
applicability date based on plan or 
policy year. 
IV. Collection of Information 
Requirements 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (PRA), the Departments are 
required to provide notice in the 
Federal Register and solicit comment 
before a collection of information 
request (ICR) is submitted to OMB for 
review and approval. These proposed 
rules contain ICRs that are subject to 
review by OMB. A description of these 
provisions is given in sections IV.C. and 
D. of this preamble with an estimate of 
the annual burden, summarized in 
Tables 35 and 36. 
To evaluate whether an information 
collection should be approved by OMB, 
section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA 
requires that the Departments solicit 
comment on the following issues: 
€The need for the information collection and its usefulness in carrying 
out the proper functions of an agency, 
including whether the information shall 
have practical utility. 
€The accuracy of the Departments’ estimate of the information collection 
burden, including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used. 
€The quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected. 
€Recommendations to minimize the information collection burden on the 
affected public, including automated 
collection techniques. 
A. Allocation of Total Burden Hours to 
the Departments of Health and Human 
Services, Labor, and the Treasury 
Based on their respective jurisdiction 
over issuers and third-party 
administrators (TPAs), HHS is estimated 
to account for 50 percent of the total 
burden, while the Departments of Labor 
and the Treasury would each account 
for 25 percent. Tables 4 and 5 present 
each Department’s share of the total on- 
going and one-time estimated burden 
hours needed to implement the 
proposed requirements.

equivalent costs of the information 
collection requirements (ICRs). The 
CALC tool was developed to assist 
acquisition professionals with market 
research and price analysis of labor 
categories under multiple U.S. General 
Services Administration (GSA) and 
Veterans Administration (VA) contracts. 
While the Departments recognize that 
various methods exist for estimating 
fringe benefits and overhead costs, the 
CALC database was selected because, 
unlike Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 
data, which is valuable for identifying 
broad labor market trends, the CALC 
tool is specifically designed to support 
market research for government 
procurement. It provides cost estimates 
for specific labor categories based on 
actual contract rates. More importantly, 
CALC data reflects fully burdened 
hourly rates, including both base pay 
and benefits, whereas BLS data reflects 
only base wages. The Departments 
determined that CALC’s occupation- 
specific data better aligns with the skill 
sets and job functions necessary for 
implementing the requirements in these 
proposed rules and therefore provides a 
more suitable basis for estimating labor 
costs. Table 6 presents the fully 
burdened mean hourly wage and 
occupations used in the Departments’ 
estimates.

C. ICRs Regarding Requirements for 
Disclosures to Participants, 
Beneficiaries, or Enrollees Under 26 
CFR 54.9815–2715A2, 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A2, and 45 CFR 147.211 
As discussed previously in this 
preamble, the Departments propose 
several amendments to the 2020 final 
rules to improve price transparency and 
strengthen consumer protections for 
participants, beneficiaries, and 
enrollees. First, the Departments 
propose revising the disclaimer required 
under paragraph (b)(1)(vii)(A) to clarify 
that the cost-sharing information does 
not account for potential additional 
amounts in situations where applicable 
State and Federal law allow out-of- 
network providers to balance bill 
participants, beneficiaries, and 
enrollees. These revisions reflect the 
Federal balance billing protections 
introduced by the No Surprises Act, 
which were not in effect when the 
original provision was finalized. These 
proposed revisions aim to ensure that 
participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees 
understand that cost-sharing estimates 
disclosed through their plan’s or issuer’s 
self-service tool may not account for 
additional amounts owed to out-of- 
network providers. 
In addition, the Departments propose 
adding a new paragraph (b)(2)(iii) 
requiring plans and issuers to make 
cost-sharing information available by 
telephone, consistent with requirements 
under the No Surprises Act. The 
Departments propose to require a 
telephone number for consumer 
assistance that Code section 9816(e), 
ERISA section 716(e), and PHS Act 
section 2799A–1(e), as added by section 
107 of the No Surprises Act, requires be 
indicated on any physical or electronic 
plan or insurance identification card 
issued to a participant, beneficiary, or 
enrollee. The proposal further states 
that, to reduce unnecessary 
administrative burden and prevent 
consumer confusion, providing the 
information as specified in paragraph 
(b)(1) and in the method and format as 
specified in paragraph (b)(2), as 
amended by these proposed rules, 
would satisfy the price comparison tool 
requirements under section 114 of the 
No Surprises Act. The requirements in 
these proposed rules apply to non- 
grandfathered group health plans and 
health insurance issuers offering non- 
grandfathered coverage in the group and 
individual markets. 
As discussed in section VI.C.3. of this 
preamble, the Departments assume that 
self-insured group health plans would 
depend on TPAs, including issuers 
providing administrative services only 
and non-issuer TPAs, to implement 
these proposed updates, including the 
new phone disclosure requirement. This 
assumption is based on the 
Departments’ understanding that most 
self-insured group health plans already 
rely on TPAs to perform core 
administrative functions, such as 
enrollment and claims processing.
159
 
For those self-insured plans that choose 
to develop their own internet-based self- 
service tools (and which are included in 
the total count of issuers and TPAs used 
to estimate burden), the Departments 
assume that they would incur costs and 
burdens similar to those estimated for 
issuers and TPAs. Accordingly, the 
Departments use issuers and TPAs as 
the unit of analysis for estimating the 
cost of proposed changes. The 
Departments also assume that issuers 
and TPAs have already developed 
internet-based self-service tools, 
originally required for plan or policy 
years beginning on or after January 1, 
2023, and would only need to modify 
these existing systems to comply with 
the proposed provisions. The 
Departments acknowledge that some 
interactive voice response (IVR) 
programming work may be necessary, 
but the Departments expect the 
associated cost would be minimal. The 
Departments welcome comment on 
these assumptions. 
As also noted in section VI.C.3. of this 
preamble, the Departments estimate that 
approximately 1,375 issuers
160
and 205 
TPAs
161
(a total of 1,580 entities) would 
implement the proposed requirements. 
The Departments acknowledge that 
actual costs may vary depending on 
factors such as the volume of providers 
and items or services for which cost- 
sharing information must be disclosed, 
and whether plans (or TPAs on behalf 
of plans) and issuers already have tools 
that fully or partially meet the proposed 
requirements or can be readily adapted. 
The Departments welcome comment on 
the assumptions and inputs used to 
develop these burden and cost 
estimates. 
The Departments also assume that 
plans (or TPAs on behalf of plans) have

According to a 2012 report by the Healthcare 
Financial Management Association, the average 
handle time for call centers generally ranges from 
7 to 8 minutes. For purposes of this analysis, the 
Departments assume an additional 2 minutes would 
be needed for call documentation, resulting in an 
average handle time of 9 to 10 minutes. 
Accordingly, the Departments use 9 minutes as the 
lower bound and 10 minutes as the upper bound 
to estimate the potential impact of increased call 
times under the proposed disclosure requirements.

According to data from the Congressional 
Research Service, the total insured population in 
private/commercial insurance, including employer- 
sponsored and individual market coverage, is 
projected to be approximately 156 million in 2023 
(of the estimated 304 million insured individuals in 
2023, approximately 148 million are covered by 
public programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, VA 
Care, and TRICARE. The remaining 156 million are 
covered under private/commercial insurance, 
including both employer-sponsored and individual 
market plans). The Departments estimate 5 percent 
of total calls would be shopping-related calls per 
year under the high-call time scenario. This 
estimate is informed by a KFF study (https://
www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/kff-survey-of- 
consumer-experiences-with-health-insurance/) in 
which 57 percent of adults contacted their 
insurance in 2023, with under 31percent asking 
about out-of-pocket expenses—a subset of which 
could reasonably be considered shopping related 
calls. Considering that consumers contact plans via 
phone, online, in-person, or in writing, it was 
estimated that 25 percent of these contacts were by 
phone. Of these phone contacts, 10–20 percent of 
the 31 percent asking about out-of-pocket expenses 
were assumed to be shopping calls, resulting in an 
estimated range of 2.5 percent to 5 percent of total 
calls being shopping-related. Using the upper 
bound of 5 percent for the high-call time scenario, 
this results in approximately 7.8 million shopping- 
related calls per year. Congressional Research 
Service, U.S. Health Care Coverage and Spending 
(Feb. 19, 2025), https://www.congress.gov/crs- 
product/IF10830. 
164
This calculation distributes the total workload 
across all 1,580 issuers and TPAs. At the industry 
level, there are 7,800,000 high-call time calls per 
year, with an average handle time of 10 minutes per 
call, resulting in 78,000,000 total minutes 
(1,300,000 hours). To compute the per-entity 
workload, the total calls are divided by the number 
of issuers and TPAs: 7,800,000/1,580  4,937 calls per entity per year. Multiplying the per-entity calls 
by the 10-minute average handle time gives 49,370 
minutes annually per entity, which converts to 
approximately 823 hours (49,370/60). 
already built self-service tools and 
would only be required to revise the 
disclaimer stating that out-of-network 
providers may engage in balance billing, 
subject to applicable State and Federal 
laws. Although these updates build on 
existing infrastructure, they would 
require a one-time cost for minor 
technical modifications including 
editing disclosure text, testing for 
quality assurance, and implementing 
the update. The Departments estimate 
that, on average, each issuer or TPA 
would require 10 minutes 
(approximately 0.17 hours) of a Senior 
Application Developer’s time (at $143 
per hour) to update the disclosure. As 
shown in Table 7, across all 1,580 
issuers and TPAs, the total one-time 
burden is estimated at 263 hours, with 
an associated cost of approximately 
$37,657. 
a. High Impact for Providing Cost- 
Sharing Information Via Phone 
Under a scenario with increased call 
volume and duration (that is, high 
impact), the Departments anticipate that 
requiring cost-sharing information to 
also be accessible by phone, could 
increase call volume and call duration 
to the plan’s or issuer’s customer 
support line. This anticipated increase 
is driven by participants, beneficiaries, 
and enrollees who may prefer verbal 
assistance, have limited digital access or 
literacy, or need help interpreting 
complex pricing information. 
Accordingly, the Departments 
estimate that for each issuer or TPA, it 
would require 10 minutes
162
for a 
customer service representative (at $40 
per hour) to speak with each consumer 
and provide the requested information 
and complete post-call documentation. 
Assuming, as a high impact scenario 
estimate, there would be 7.8 million 
calls annually,
163
each issuer or TPA 
would receive approximately 4,937 calls 
per year, resulting in an estimated 
annual burden of 823 hours,
164
with an 
estimated associated cost of $32,911. As 
shown in Table 8, the Departments 
estimate that for all 1,580 issuers and 
TPAs, the estimated total ongoing 
annual burden would be approximately 
1,300,000 hours, with an estimated 
associated cost of $52 million annually.

According to data from the Congressional 
Research Service, the total insured population in 
private/commercial insurance, including employer- 
sponsored and individual market coverage, is 
projected to be approximately 156 million in 2023 
(of the estimated 304 million insured individuals in 
2023, approximately 148 million are covered by 
public programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, VA 
Care, and TRICARE. The remaining 156 million are 
covered under private/commercial insurance, 
including both employer-sponsored and individual 
market plans). The Departments estimate that 2.5 
percent of total calls would be shopping-related 
calls per year under the low-call time scenario. This 
estimate is informed by a KFF study (https://
www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/kff-survey-of- 
consumer-experiences-with-health-insurance/) in 
which 57 percent of adults contacted their 
insurance in 2023, with under 31 percent asking 
about out-of-pocket expenses—a subset of which 
could reasonably be considered shopping related 
calls. Considering that consumers contact plans via 
phone, online, in-person, or in writing, it was 
estimated that 25 percent of these contacts were by 
phone. Of these phone contacts, 10–20 percent of 
the 31percent asking about out-of-pocket expenses 
were assumed to be shopping calls, resulting in an 
estimated range of 2.5 percent to 5 percent of total 
calls being shopping-related. Using the lower bound 
of 2.5 percent for the low-call time scenario, this 
results in approximately 3.9 million shopping- 
related calls per year. Congressional Research 
Service, U.S. Health Care Coverage and Spending 
(Feb. 19, 2025), https://www.congress.gov/crs- 
product/IF10830. 
166
This calculation distributes the total workload 
across all 1,580 issuers and TPAs. At the industry 
level, there are 3,900,000 high-volume calls per 
year, with an average handle time of 9 minutes per 
call, resulting in 35,100,000 total minutes (585,000 
hours). To compute the per-entity workload, the 
total calls are divided by the number of issuers and 
TPAs: 3,900,000/1,580  2,468 calls per entity per year. Multiplying the per-entity calls by the 9 
minute average handle time gives 22,212 minutes 
annually per entity, which converts to 
approximately 370 hours (22,212/60). 
Under a scenario with less call 
volume and duration (that is, lower- 
impact scenario), the Departments 
assume that a smaller subset of 
participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees 
would opt to request pricing 
information by phone. In this scenario, 
the Departments estimate that for each 
issuer or TPA it would take 9 minutes 
for a customer service representative (at 
$40 per hour) to speak with consumers 
and provide the requested information 
and complete post-call documentation. 
Assuming 3.9 million calls annually,
165
 
each issuer or TPA would receive 
approximately 2,468 calls per year, 
resulting in an estimated annual burden 
of 370 hours
166
with an estimated 
associated cost of $14,810 per issuer or 
TPA. As shown in Table 9, across all 
1,580 issuers and TPAs, the estimated 
total ongoing burden would be 
approximately 585,000 hours, with a 
total annual cost of approximately $23.4 
million. 
Plans (or TPAs on behalf of plans) and 
issuers would also incur a one-time 
burden and cost to train customer 
service representatives and their 
supervisors on the proposed phone 
requirement. The Departments assume 
this requirement would not necessitate 
hiring additional full-time staff. Instead, 
the Departments expect issuers and 
TPAs to rely on existing customer 
service representatives and supervisors 
for this task. For each issuer or TPA, the 
Departments estimate that one training 
specialist would spend 8 hours (at $104 
per hour) to train 20 customer service 
representatives (totaling 160 hours at 
$40 per hour) and two supervisors 
(totaling 16 hours at $91 per hour) on 
how to respond to participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees seeking 
pricing information by phone. This 
results in a one-time burden of 184 
hours per issuer or TPA, with an 
estimated associated cost of $8,688. As 
shown in Table 10, for all 1,580 issuers 
and TPAs, the total estimated one-time 
training hour burden would be 290,720 
hours, with a corresponding cost of 
approximately $13,727,040. 
The Departments anticipate that, in 
the future, ongoing training costs 
associated with the proposed phone 
requirements would be incorporated 
into existing onboarding programs for 
new employees and included in the 
regular annual training provided to 
current staff. 
The Departments request comment on 
the estimated cost and burden hours 
presented in this analysis, including any 
additional costs or challenges that 
commenters may identify.

separate file for each provider network, 
allow rates to be expressed as a 
percentage of billed charges when 
appropriate, associate enrollment totals 
for each plan or coverage option, 
disclose provider network product 
types, and exclude providers unlikely to 
be reimbursed based on their scope of 
practice. For Allowed Amount Files, the 
proposals include requiring data 
reporting at the market level instead of 
the individual plan level, lowering the 
claims threshold from 20 to 11, 
extending the reporting period from 90 
days to 6 months, and increasing the 
lookback period from 180 days to 9 
months to enhance the robustness of 
historical data. In addition, these 
proposed rules would require plans and 
issuers to post several contextual 
machine-readable files: a Change-log 
File, a Utilization File, a Taxonomy File, 
and a Text File, each with specific 
update and posting requirements. These 
changes are intended to strengthen 
transparency and improve the 
usefulness of publicly available pricing 
information. 
As discussed in section VI.C.3. of this 
preamble, the Departments assume that 
self-insured group health plans would 
depend on TPAs, including issuers 
providing administrative services only 
and non-issuer TPAs, to implement 
these proposed updates, noting that 
some self-insured plans may choose to 
comply individually, likely incurring a 
similar hour burden. 
The Departments recognize that some 
proposed requirements may be 
integrated into existing operational 
processes, potentially reducing 
implementation burdens, though the 
Departments acknowledge that the 
extent of integration varies significantly 
across different requirements. Marginal 
modifications may include adjusting 
reporting thresholds from 20 to 11 
claims, extending lookback and 
reporting periods, and adding website 
footer links, while higher-burden 
implementations likely include 
network-level file reorganization, new 
file creation such as Taxonomy, Change- 
log, and Utilization Files, and provider- 
rate combination exclusion logic. 
Although some activities may align with 
routine system updates and 
maintenance cycles, the Departments 
provide detailed burden estimates for 
requirements involving substantial 
system modifications or new 
operational processes. The Departments 
seek public comment on additional 
costs or implementation challenges that 
may not be fully captured in this 
assessment. 
1. ICRs Regarding Requirements To 
Organize Files by Provider Network, 
Allow Service Providers or Other Parties 
To Organize by Provider Network 
Across Multiple Self-Insured Group 
Health Plans (26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(1)(i) and (b)(5)(iii), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(1)(i) and 
(b)(5)(iii), and 45 CFR 147.212(b)(1)(i) 
and (b)(5)(iii)) 
The Departments propose to amend 
26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(1)(i), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(1)(i), and 45 
CFR 147.212(b)(1)(i) to require plans 
and issuers to make an In-network Rate 
File available for each provider network 
they maintain or contract with 
associated with the plan or policy being 
reported. The Departments also propose 
to add new 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(5)(iii), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(5)(iii), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(5)(iii) to permit In-network 
Rate Files to be made available by 
provider network for multiple plans 
administered by service providers or 
other parties, including those offered by 
different plan sponsors and including 
across different health insurance 
markets. 
Under the current technical reporting 
requirements, plans and issuers publish 
an In-network Rate File for each plan or 
coverage they offer. As a result, the 
scope of the existing disclosure is at the 
individual plan or policy level, rather 
than at the broader provider network 
level. Current technical implementation 
guidance gives plans and issuers 
flexibility in how they structure their In- 
network Rate File to associate providers 
with negotiated rates. As a result, some 
plans or issuers may already be using 
network-based aggregation to both 
optimize the size of their output files as 
well as allow for greater file reuse across 
multiple plans. As discussed in section 
III.C.1. of this preamble, the 
Departments understand that many 
plans and issuers already leverage a 
Table of Contents to organize their files, 
an approach that would allow them to 
combine common negotiated rates 
across multiple In-network Rate Files, 
rather than publishing negotiated rates 
individually for each plan ID. However, 
the Departments assume that few have 
fully implemented that second step to 
organize files by provider networks with 
common negotiated rates across 
multiple In-network Rate Files, and 
many have not adopted it at all. 
For burden estimation, the 
Departments make the assumption that 
no plans or issuers have adapted their 
In-network Rate File processes to align 
with this proposed provision. While this 
may overstate the implementation 
burden for some, it provides a 
reasonable upper bound, ensuring the 
estimates cover the substantial and 
complex changes that most plans or 
issuers may need to make to comply 
with this proposal. 
To implement this proposed 
provision, plans (or TPAs on behalf of 
plans) and issuers would need to 
modify their In-network Rate File 
processes to produce files aggregated at 
the provider network level rather than 
the plan level, and to generate a 
crosswalk table that associates each 
coverage option to the corresponding 
provider network the plan or issuer 
maintains or contracts with. The 
implementation will involve a 
meaningful, one-time recoding effort to 
revise existing In-network Rate File 
processes. However, because the 
underlying data used to build the In- 
network Rate Files will not change, 
these revisions will be incremental and 
build on the current process. 
The proposed provision would also 
require, under newly proposed 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A), that each In- 
network Rate File be associated with its 
common provider network name. In 
practice, this means plans (or TPAs on 
behalf of plans) and issuers would need 
to add a new data element and identify 
the source of the common provider 
network names within their systems of 
record so these can be incorporated into 
the automated process for generating the 
required information for the In-network 
Rate Files. However, the Departments 
assume that plans (or TPAs on behalf of 
plans) and issuers would already have 
identified and captured these common 
provider network names as part of the 
related proposal to organize the In- 
network Rate Files by provider network. 
As a result, the Departments expect that 
any burden associated with disclosing 
this new data element is accounted for 
in the burden estimate for organizing 
these files by provider network, with no 
additional burden anticipated. The 
Departments seek comment on this 
assumption. 
The Departments estimate that issuers 
and TPAs would incur a one-time cost 
and burden to modify a plan’s or 
issuer’s current process for generating 
In-network Rate Files to disclose 
discrete provider networks and 
crosswalk those networks to relevant 
plans or policies. As shown in Table 11, 
the Departments estimate that, on 
average, each issuer or TPA would 
require 16 hours from a Project Manager 
or Team Lead (at $153 per hour), 80 
hours from a Technical Architect/Sr. 
Developer (at $149 per hour), 80 hours 
from a Senior Application Developer (at 
$143 per hour), and 16 hours from a

modify the plan’s or issuer’s current 
process, resulting in a one-time burden 
for each issuer or TPA of 192 hours with 
an estimated associated cost of $27,728. 
For all 1,580 issuers and TPAs, as 
shown in Table 12, the Departments 
estimate a total one-time burden of 
303,360 hours with an estimated 
associated cost of $43,810,240. 
The Departments request comment on 
the estimated cost and burden hours 
presented in this analysis, including any 
additional costs or challenges that 
commenters may identify. 
2. ICRs Regarding Requirements To 
Include Product Type in Both In- 
Network Rate and Allowed Amount 
Files (26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(1)(i)(B) and (b)(1)(ii)(A), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(1)(i)(B), and 
(b)(1)(ii)(A), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(1)(i)(B) and (b)(1)(ii)(A)) 
The Departments propose to amend 
redesignated paragraphs 26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A3(b)(1)(i)(B) and 
(b)(1)(ii)(A), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(1)(i)(B), and (b)(1)(ii)(A), and 
45 CFR 147.212(b)(1)(i)(B) and 
(b)(1)(ii)(A) to require plans and issuers 
to report the product type (for example, 
HMO or PPO) associated with each 
coverage option in both the In-network 
Rate File and the Allowed Amount File. 
Currently, there is no requirement for 
plans and issuers to include a product 
type in their machine-readable files. The 
only identifier currently required is the 
HIOS ID or the EIN when a HIOS ID is 
not available. 
The Departments have determined 
that product type data is readily 
available to most plans and issuers and 
that this proposed requirement would 
only involve a one-time system update 
to include the product type variable in 
the machine-readable files. The 
assumptions account for time and effort 
to access the data sources from which to 
populate the product type variable 
within the machine-readable files. 
The Departments estimate a one-time 
cost and burden for plans (or TPAs on 
behalf of plans) and issuers to 
implement the required system 
automation updates. Each issuer or TPA 
would, on average, require 8 hours from 
a Project Manager or Team Lead (at $153 
per hour), 8 hours from a Senior 
Application Developer (at $143 per 
hour), 8 hours from a Technical 
Architect/Sr. Developer (at $149 per 
hour), and 8 hours from a Business 
Analyst (at $120 per hour) to make the 
system updates and implement the 
requirements proposed in these rules. 
As shown in Table 13, this results in a 
total estimated burden of 32 hours, with 
an associated estimated cost of $4,520 
per issuer or TPA. As shown in Table 
14, for all 1,580 issuers TPAs, the 
Departments estimate a total one-time 
burden of 50,560 hours with an 
associated total cost of approximately 
$7,141,600.

3. ICRs Regarding Requirements To 
Report Dollar Amounts Except for Only 
‘‘Percentage-of-Billed-Charges’’ 
Payments (26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(1)(i)(D)(1), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(1)(i)(D)(1), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(1)(i)(D)(1)) 
The Departments propose to amend 
26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(1)(i)(D)(1), 
29 CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(1)(i)(D)(1), 
and 45 CFR 147.212(b)(1)(i)(D)(1) to 
clarify that plans and issuers are 
required to report in-network rates as a 
dollar amount, except when the 
contractual arrangement specifies 
payment as a percentage of billed 
charges and it is not possible to 
determine a dollar amount before the 
bill is generated. In those cases, the plan 
or issuer would instead be required to 
report the applicable percentage. This 
requirement is intended to improve data 
quality by ensuring plans and issuers 
consistently use a percentage when the 
contract bases payment on a percentage 
of billed charges and plans and issuers 
cannot calculate a dollar amount in 
advance. 
Since this proposal codifies an 
exception for situations in which the 
Departments have indicated they are 
unlikely to pursue enforcement action, 
the Departments have determined that 
many systems would already be 
compliant, as plans and issuers should 
already be reporting dollar amounts for 
rates except in certain ‘‘percentage-of- 
billed charges’’ arrangements. The 
Departments are also of the view that 
most plans and issuers have already 
incurred a one-time cost to make this 
adjustment and would incur no 
additional implementation costs or 
burden to update the In-network Rate 
Files. However, for those plans and 
issuers that may not have made this 
alteration to their In-network Rate Files, 
the Departments estimate a one-time 
burden and cost to meet the 
requirements of this proposed 
provision. For a low-end estimate, the 
Departments assume that 20 percent of 
plans (or TPAs on behalf of the plan) 
and issuers would need to make this 
one-time modification to their In- 
network Rate Files, while for a high-end 
estimate, it’s assumed that all plans (or 
TPAs on behalf of the plan) and issuers 
would need to make this adjustment to 
their In-network Rate Files. 
The Departments estimate, on 
average, each affected issuer or TPA 
would require 8 hours from a Project 
Manager or Team Lead (at $153 per 
hour), 8 hours from a Technical 
Architect/Sr. Developer (at $149 per 
hour), 8 hours of work from a Senior 
Application Developer (at $143 per 
hour), and 8 hours from a Business 
Analyst (at $120 per hour) to review 
their In-network Rate File generation 
code to determine if there are any 
instances where a non-dollar amount 
would appear in the file and then make 
the necessary coding adjustments and 
validate the changes, resulting in an 
estimated burden of 32 hours, with an 
estimated associated cost of $4,520 per 
issuer or TPA, as shown in Table 15. 
The Departments estimate that, under 
the low-end scenario, affected issuers 
and TPAs would incur a total one-time 
burden of 10,112 hours with an 
associated total cost of approximately 
$1,428,320. Under the high-end 
scenario, for all issuers and TPAs, the 
total one-time burden would be 50,560 
hours with an associated total cost of 
approximately $7,141,600, as shown in 
Table 16.

4. ICRs Regarding Requirements To 
Report Required Enrollment Data (26 
CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(1)(i)(E), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(1)(i)(E), and 
45 CFR 147.212(b)(1)(i)(E)) 
The Departments propose adding a 
new provision at 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(1)(i)(E), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(1)(i)(E), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(1)(i)(E) requiring plans and 
issuers to include the current 
enrollment totals (number of 
individuals) for each coverage option 
associated with the applicable In- 
network Rate File, as of the date the file 
is posted. 
The Departments recognize that each 
plan or issuer would report a different 
number of coverage options, so the 
estimates reflect a presumed average. 
These estimates include the preparatory 
work needed for plans (or TPAs on 
behalf of plans) and issuers to 
understand the requirement, identify 
data sources (enrollment data may be 
stored across multiple systems), assess 
current systems, and agree on necessary 
system changes. 
To implement this provision, plans 
(or TPAs on behalf of plans) and issuers 
would incur a one-time cost to update 
their systems to automate the retrieval 
and reporting of the required enrollment 
data. Furthermore, the Departments 
expect this work to be coordinated with 
efforts to comply with the proposed 
amendments under section IV.D.1. of 
this preamble, which requires listing 
each plan associated with a network. 
Accordingly, the Departments 
estimate a one-time burden and cost for 
issuers and TPAs to update their 
systems to include a field for current 
enrollment totals and to automate 
ongoing data extraction. On average, 
each issuer or TPA would require 8 
hours from a Project Manager or Team 
Lead (at $153 per hour), 8 hours from 
a Technical Architect/Sr. Developer (at 
$149 per hour), 8 hours from a Senior 
Application Developer (at $143 per 
hour), and 8 hours from a Business 
Analyst (at $120 per hour) to complete 
this work. As shown in Table 17, this 
results in a total estimated burden of 32 
hours per issuer or TPA, with an 
associated cost of approximately $4,520. 
For all 1,580 issuers and TPAs, as 
shown in Table 18, the Departments 
estimate a total one-time burden of 
50,560 hours and a total cost of 
approximately $7,141,600.

5. ICRs Regarding Requirements To 
Exclude Certain Providers From In- 
Network Rate Files (26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(1)(i)(F), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(1)(i)(F) and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(1)(i)(F)) 
The Departments propose to amend 
the paragraph on required information 
under 26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(1)(i), 
29 CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(1)(i), and 
45 CFR 147.212(b)(1)(i) to increase 
access to and improve the usability of 
the data reported in the In-network Rate 
File, by adding new paragraph 
(b)(1)(i)(F). This new paragraph would 
require plans and issuers to exclude 
from their In-network Rate Files a 
provider’s negotiated rate (provider-rate 
combination) for an item or service if 
the plan or issuer determines it is 
unlikely that such provider would be 
reimbursed for such item or service 
given that provider’s area of specialty 
according to the plan’s or issuer’s 
internal provider taxonomy used during 
the claims adjudication process. 
In addition, the Departments propose 
at 26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(2)(iii), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(2)(iii), and 45 
CFR 147.212(b)(2)(iii) to require plans 
and issuers to publish an additional 
machine-readable file, called a 
Taxonomy File, that includes the plan 
or issuer’s internal provider taxonomy, 
which maps items and services 
(represented by a billing code) to 
provider specialties (represented by 
specialty code) to determine if the plan 
or issuer should deny reimbursement 
for an item or service because it was not 
furnished by a provider in an 
appropriate specialty. This new file 
would increase transparency by 
showing how decisions to exclude 
certain provider-rate combinations from 
the In-network Rate File were 
determined. 
This proposed provision would 
require plans and issuers to perform two 
specific updates: (1) update their 
current programmatic code to exclude 
certain provider-rate combinations from 
the existing In-network Rate Files, and 
(2) create and publish a new Taxonomy 
File. 
The Departments have determined 
that (1) plans (or TPAs on behalf of 
plans) and issuers already maintain a 
complete listing of their in-network 
providers along with the specialties of 
those providers; (2) plans and issuers 
possess the taxonomy needed to map 
provider specialties to the appropriate 
billing codes; and (3) plans and issuers 
have implemented similar logic within 
their claims adjudication systems to 
pend or deny claims that fall outside a 
provider’s scope of practice, for 
example, if a claim for brain surgery is 
submitted by a provider whose specialty 
does not align with that procedure. 
Given this, the additional burden and 
cost required to automate the exclusion 
of certain provider-rate combinations 
would include (1) extracting and 
adapting the claims adjudication logic 
built off the internal provider taxonomy 
that determines whether a provider is 
authorized to bill for a particular service 
for use in generating the In-network 
Rate File; (2) implementing an 
automated process to extract the in- 
network provider list along with their 
specialties from the plan’s or issuer’s 
system of record; and (3) modifying the 
programmatic logic of the In-network 
Rate File generation software to exclude 
the provider-rate combinations for those 
that are not eligible to submit claims for 
specific services. 
Additionally, posting a Taxonomy 
File would require plans (or TPAs on 
behalf of plans) and issuers to list each 
taxonomy code they use and specify the 
associated service codes (for example, 
CPT codes). These mappings are 
typically stored in a reference table used 
by issuer claims adjudication systems. 
The Taxonomy File must be produced 
separately, in addition to each In- 
network Rate File. 
To update the programmatic code to 
exclude certain provider-rate 
combinations from the existing In- 
network Rate File and to create and 
publish a new Taxonomy File, the 
Departments estimate a one-time cost 
and burden for plans (or TPAs on behalf 
of plans) and issuers. On average, each 
issuer or TPA would require 48 hours 
from a Project Manager or Team Lead (at 
$153 per hour), 48 hours from a 
Technical Architect/Sr. Developer (at 
$149 per hour), 48 hours from a Senior 
Application Developer (at $143 per 
hour), and 48 hours from a Business 
Analyst (at $120 per hour). As shown in

the Departments estimate a total one-

6. ICRs Regarding Requirements To 
Lower Claims Reporting Threshold in 
the Allowed Amount File From 20 to 11 
Claims (26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(1)(ii)(C), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(1)(ii)(C), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(1)(ii)(C)) 
The Departments propose to amend 
26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(1)(ii)(C), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(1)(ii)(C), and 
45 CFR 147.212(b)(1)(ii)(C) to require 
plans and issuers to include data in the 
Allowed Amount File for items and 
services provided under a single plan or 
coverage when there are 11 or more 
unique claims for that item or service, 
lowering the current threshold from 20 
to 11 to expand the data available. 
The Departments assume this 
requirement would not create additional 
burden for plans and issuers. Existing 
systems are currently designed to report 
out-of-network allowed amounts when 
there are more than 20 claims for a 
covered item or service within a 
relevant 90-day period. Lowering the 
threshold to 11 claims is expected to 
require only marginal system variable 
adjustments, with any associated costs 
absorbed into the routine system 
maintenance activities that plans (or 
TPAs on behalf of plans) and issuers 
already perform in the normal course of 
business. The change constitutes a 
standard simple administrative update, 
rather than a system redesign, and 
therefore does not necessitate additional 
infrastructure, a dedicated project 
budget, or significant developer time. 
The adjustment can be implemented by 
existing IT personnel as part of their 
routine operational duties, with no 
disruption and minimal costs. 
The Departments request comment on 
the estimated cost and burden hours 
presented in this analysis, including any 
additional costs or challenges that 
commenters may identify. 
7. ICRs Regarding Expansion of 
Reporting and Lookback Periods for 
Allowed Amount Files From 90 Days to 
6 Months and 180 Days to 9 Months (26 
CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(1)(ii)(C), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(1)(ii)(C), and 
45 CFR 147.212(b)(1)(ii)(C)) 
The Departments propose to amend 
26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(1)(ii)(C), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(1)(ii)(C), and 
45 CFR 147.212(b)(1)(ii)(C) to expand 
the data included in the Allowed 
Amount Files by requiring plans and 
issuers to report on items and services 
furnished by out-of-network providers 
over a 6-month reporting period starting 
9 months before the file’s publication 
date, replacing the current 90-day 
reporting period that begins 180 days 
prior to the file’s publication date. 
The Departments assume extending 
the reporting period from 90 days to 6 
months would not create additional 
burden for plans and issuers, who the 
Departments assume currently have 
automated systems in production to 
report out-of-network allowed amounts. 
This change is expected to require only 
marginal system variable adjustments, 
with any associated costs absorbed into 
the routine system maintenance 
activities that plans (or TPAs on behalf 
of plans) and issuers already perform in 
the normal course of business. The 
change constitutes a standard simple 
administrative update, rather than a 
system redesign, and therefore does not 
necessitate additional infrastructure, a 
dedicated project budget, or significant 
developer time. 
The Departments request comment on 
the estimated cost and burden hours 
presented in this analysis, including any 
additional costs or challenges that 
commenters may identify.

Aggregate Allowed Amount Files by 
Market Type and Allow Service

by Market Type Across Multiple Self- 
Insured Group Health Plans (26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A3(b)(1)(ii), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(1)(ii), and 45

CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(5)(iv), and 45 
CFR 147.212(b)(5)(iv)) 
The Departments propose to amend 
26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(1)(ii), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(1)(ii), and 45 
CFR 147.212(b)(1)(ii) to require plans 
and issuers to aggregate out-of-network 
data reporting by health insurance 
market, specifically by grouping plan- 
level data into one of four categories: (1) 
small group market, (2) individual 
market, (3) large group market, and (4) 
plans in self-insured group markets. 
Under current technical reporting 
requirements, plans and issuers may, 
but are not required to, aggregate data 
across multiple plans or policies to meet 
public disclosure requirements for the 
Allowed Amount Files. The 
Departments also propose to amend 
redesignated 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(5)(iv), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(5)(iv), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(5)(iv) to permit Allowed 
Amount Files to be aggregated by 
market type at the service provider 
level, rather than the plan level, for 
more than one self-insured group health 
plan, including those offered by 
different plan sponsors. 
The Departments are of the view that 
this proposal would not require plans 
(or TPAs on behalf of plans) and issuers 
to make substantial changes to how they 
currently generate Allowed Amount 
Files. Instead, it would require 
modifying the output so that, rather 
than producing a separate Allowed 
Amount File for each plan or policy, 
plans and issuers would aggregate data 
into a single file for each applicable 
market category. The four market 
categories, small group, large group, 
individual, and plans in self-insured 
group markets, are already well 
established under existing market-wide 
regulations, and plans and issuers can 
use existing data elements in their 
systems to classify each plan 
appropriately.
167
 
The Departments estimate that plans 
(or TPAs on behalf of plans) and issuers 
would incur a one-time cost and burden 
to modify and update their existing 
Allowed Amount File processes to 
produce output files aggregated by 
market segment. On average, each issuer 
or TPA would require 16 hours from a 
Project Manager or Team Lead (at $153 
per hour), 16 hours from a Technical 
Architect/Sr. Developer (at $149 per 
hour), 16 hours of work from a Senior 
Application Developer (at $143 per 
hour), and 16 hours from a Business 
Analyst (at $120 per hour) to complete 
this work. As shown in Table 21, this 
results in a total estimated burden of 64 
hours per issuer or TPA, with an 
associated cost of approximately $9,040. 
For all 1,580 issuers and TPAs, as 
shown in Table 22, the Departments 
estimate a total one-time burden of 
101,120 hours and a total cost of 
approximately $14,283,200. 
The Departments request comment on 
the estimated cost and burden hours 
presented in this analysis, including any  additional costs or challenges that 
commenters may identify.

a Change-Log File Related to the In- 
Network Rate File Disclosures (26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A3(b)(2)(i), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(2)(i), and 45 
CFR 147.212(b)(2)(i)) 
The Departments propose adding a 
new provision under 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(2)(i), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(2)(i), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(2)(i) that would require plans 
and issuers to publish a Change-log File 
on a quarterly basis, on the same day the 
In-network Rate File is published, 
identifying all changes made since the 
previous version. 
Under this proposal, each plan or 
issuer would be required to publish a 
Change-log File each quarter, 
identifying any changes made to the In- 
network Rate File for each provider 
network maintained or contracted by 
that plan or issuer compared to the file 
in the preceding quarter. If there are no 
changes made to the machine-readable 
file since that previous file’s posting, a 
Change-log File must still be posted 
indicating there are no changes. 
This proposed requirement does not 
currently specify the required level of 
detail for the Change-log File, such as 
whether it should include high-level 
summaries or detailed information 
about changes to specific data points. As 
noted in section III.C.7.a. of this 
preamble, the Departments are seeking 
comment on which data elements 
should be included and on the overall 
design of the Change-log File. Due to the 
nature of the proposed provision, the 
Departments have made certain 
assumptions based on current 
information available to estimate the 
burden hours and cost of this proposed 
provision. 
The Departments assume that plans 
and issuers would develop an 
automated system to track changes in 
the required data fields and report 
specific detailed information, such as 
the exact dollar amount of an applicable 
rate change. The Departments estimate 
that each issuer and TPA would incur 
a one-time burden and cost to develop 
and implement the to the proposed 
provision including to identify data 
sources for each field, write code to 
detect changes from the previous file, 
generate the Change-log File, and 
conduct testing and quality control 
before establishing a process to make 
the file available to the public. Once 
these systems are in place, creating the 
Change-log File is expected to be 
automated. 
On average, each plan (or a TPA on 
behalf of the plan) or issuer would 
require 50 hours from a Project Manager 
or Team Lead (at $153 per hour), 220 
hours from a Technical Architect/Sr. 
Developer (at $149 per hour), 220 hours 
from a Senior Application Developer (at 
$143 per hour), 50 hours from a 
Business Analyst (at $120 per hour), and 
36 hours from a DevOps Engineer (at 
$181 per hour) to complete this work. 
As shown in Table 23, this results in a 
total estimated burden of 576 hours per 
issuer or TPA, with an associated cost 
of approximately $84,406. For all 1,580 
issuers and TPAs, as shown in Table 24, 
the Departments estimate a total one- 
time burden of 910,080 hours and a total 
cost of approximately $133,361,480. 
The Departments request comment on 
the estimated cost and burden hours 
presented in this analysis, including any 
additional costs or challenges that 
commenters may identify. 
10. ICRs Regarding Requirements To 
Implement the Disclosures Required for 
the Utilization File (26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(2)(ii), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(2)(ii), and 45 CFR

At 26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(2)(ii), 
29 CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(2)(ii), and 
45 CFR 147.212(b)(2)(ii), the 
Departments propose requiring a 
Utilization File, which would require 
plans and issuers to list all items and 
services for which a claim has been 
submitted and reimbursed, in whole or 
in part from in-network providers and 
identify each provider who submitted 
claims for each item or service. The

Utilization File include information 
from the 12-month period that ends 6 
months prior to the publication of the 
Utilization File and be updated every 12 
months. 
The Departments assume that data for 
the new Utilization File is readily 
accessible to all plans and issuers 
through their existing claims databases. 
Posting a Utilization File would require 
issuers to programmatically generate a 
list of each unique combination of 
provider NPI, TIN, and place of service 
from their claims database for in- 
network providers reimbursed for any 
covered item or service during a 
specified period. In addition to the one- 
time burden and cost associated with 
the initial coding effort to create the 
Utilization File, plans and issuers 
would incur annual ongoing operational 
burden and cost to produce the annual 
Utilization File, validate the data, store 
the Utilization File, and post it to the 
designated public access location. 
Because the process for generating the 
Utilization File is similar to the logic 
used for creating the Allowed Amount 
File, and existing programmatic logic 
could serve as a starting point for the 
creation of the Utilization File, the 
Departments assume the burden and 
cost would be lower than those 
originally estimated in the 2020 final 
rules for the development and 
implementation of the Allowed Amount 
File. 
Given the differences in the two files 
and past experience with the Allowed 
Amount File, the Departments estimate 
a one-time cost and burden for plans (or 
TPAs on behalf of plans) and issuers to 
develop, implement, and operate the 
Utilization File to meet the 
requirements of these proposed rules. 
On average, each issuer or TPA would 
require 364 hours from a Scrum Master 
(at $105 per hour), 546 hours from a 
Technical Architect/Sr. Developer (at 
$149 per hour), 1,456 hours of work 
from a Senior Application Developer (at 
$143 per hour), 364 hours from a 
Business Analyst (at $120 per hour), and 
182 hours from a DevOps Engineer (at 
$181per hour). As shown in Table 25, 
this results in a total estimated burden 
of 2,912 hours per issuer or TPA, with 
an associated cost of approximately 
$404,404. For all 1,580 issuers and 
TPAs, as shown in Table 26, the 
Departments estimate a total one-time 
burden of 4,600,960 hours and a total 
cost of approximately $638,958,320. 
In addition to the one-time burden 
and cost estimated in Tables 25 and 26, 
plans (or TPAs on behalf of plans) and 
issuers would incur ongoing annual 
burden and cost to update the 
Utilization File. The Departments 
estimate that, on average, each issuer or 
TPA would annually require 6 hours 
from a Scrum Master (at $105 per hour), 
16 hours of work from a Senior 
Application Developer (at $143 per 
hour), and 16 hours from DevOps 
Engineer (at $181 per hour) to make the 
required updates. As shown in Table 27, 
this results in a total estimated annual 
burden of 38 hours per issuer or TPA, 
with an associated cost of 
approximately $5,814. For all 1,580 
issuers and TPAs, as shown in Table 28, 
the Departments estimate a total 
ongoing annual burden of 60,040 hours 
and a total cost of approximately 
$9,186,120. The 3-year average costs 
and burden for this proposal are 
presented in Table 29.

11. ICRs Regarding Requirements To 
Add a Text File, Identify Point-of- 
Contact for Inquiries To Improve 
Discoverability and Accessibility of 
Machine-Readable Files, and Respond 
to Machine-Readable File Inquiries (26 
CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(2)(iv), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(2)(iv), and 45 
CFR 147.212(b)(2)(iv)) 
The Departments propose to add new 
26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(2)(iv), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(2)(iv), and 45 
CFR 147.212(b)(2)(iv), which would 
establish a new requirement for plans 
and issuers to improve the accessibility 
of their machine-readable files. Under 
this proposal, plans (or TPAs on behalf 
of plans) and issuers would be required 
to generate a Text File that includes the 
URL of the page hosting the machine- 
readable files, a direct link to the 
machine-readable files themselves, and 
contact information for the individual at 
the plan, issuer, or TPA that is 
responsible for the machine-readable 
files. This Text File would be required 
to be placed in the root folder of the 
public website domain selected to host 
the machine-readable files, without 
regard to the website’s page structure. 
This proposed new requirement would 
align with similar provisions under the 
2023 Hospital Price Transparency 
rule
168
at 45 CFR 180.50(d)(6) and is 
intended to enhance the discoverability, 
usability, and consistency of pricing 
information for participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees, third-party 
developers, researchers, and regulators. 
The Departments anticipate plans (or 
a TPA on behalf of plans) and issuers 
would incur a one-time development 
burden to update their systems to 
support the automated generation and 
publication of the required Text File. In 
addition to setting up the ability to 
produce the Text File, plans (or TPAs 
on behalf of plans) and issuers would 
identify a point-of-contact for the file 
that would be available to address 
inquiries and issues related to the 
required machine-readable files and 
include this point-of-contact in the Text 
Files. The point-of-contact identified 
would need to set up a mechanism to 
receive and respond to inquiries and 
issues, such an email box or online 
feedback form. 
The Departments estimate a one-time 
burden and cost for plans (or TPAs on

test, and implement the automation 
necessary to generate and post the 
required Text File in the root folder of 
their public website as well as set up a 
mechanism to receive and respond to 
inquiries and issues. On average, each 
issuer or TPA would require 8 hours of 
work from a Senior Application 
Developer (at $143 per hour), 8 hours 
from a Project Manager or Team Lead (at 
$153 per hour), and 8 hours from a 
Business Analyst (at $120 per hour). As 
shown in Table 30, this results in a total 
estimated burden of 24 hours per entity, 
with an associated cost of 
approximately $3,328. Across all 1,580 
issuers and TPAs, the Departments 
estimate a total one-time burden of 
37,920 hours and a combined cost of 
approximately $5,258,240, as presented 
in Table 31. 
In addition to the one-time costs 
estimated in Tables 30 and 31, plans (or 
TPAs on behalf of plans) and issuers 
would incur ongoing annual burden and 
cost to respond to inquiries and issues 
on the machine-readable files. The 
Departments assume that each issuer 
and TPA would establish a team to 
triage, review, and respond to the 
inquiries. The Departments estimate 
that, on average each year, each issuer 
or TPA would receive approximately 30 
inquiries. Addressing each inquiry is 
estimated to require 10 minutes of work 
per inquiry from an Attorney III 
(totaling 300 minutes for 30 inquiries at 
$143 per hour), 20 minutes per inquiry 
from a Senior Application Developer 
(totaling 600 minutes for 30 inquiries at 
$143 per hour), and 30 minutes per 
inquiry from a Project Manager/Team 
Lead (totaling 900 minutes for 30 
inquiries at $153 per hour). As shown 
in Table 32, this results in a total 
estimated annual burden of 30 hours per 
issuer or TPA, with an associated cost 
of approximately $4,440 for each issuer 
or TPA. As shown in Table 33, the 
Departments estimate a total ongoing 
annual burden of 47,400 hours and a 
total cost of approximately $7,015,200 
for all 1,580 issuers and TPAs. The 3- 
year average burden hours and costs for 
this proposal are presented in Table 34.

PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202410-0938-006. The Departments request comment on 
the estimated cost and burden hours 
presented in this analysis, including any 
additional costs or challenges that 
commenters may identify. 
12. ICRs Regarding Requirements To 
Add a Price Transparency Footer Link 
on Website Directing Users to the 
Location of the Machine-Readable Files 
(26 CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(3)(iii), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(3)(iii), and 45 
CFR 147.212(b)(3)(iii)) 
The Departments propose to add a 
new requirement at 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(3)(iii), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(3)(iii), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(3)(iii) to improve user access 
to machine-readable files published 
under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2). 
Specifically, plans and issuers would be 
required to include a link to the internet 
domain where the machine-readable 
files are hosted on the footer of their 
website. This link must appear on the 
home page and on any other page that 
includes a footer and must be labeled as 
‘‘Price Transparency’’ or ‘‘Transparency 
in Coverage.’’ 
The Departments anticipate that the 
burden associated with this proposed 
requirement would be minimal, as it 
would involve only basic website 
modifications. 
The Departments request comment on 
the estimated cost and burden hours 
presented in this analysis, including any 
additional costs or challenges that 
commenters may identify. 
E. Submission of PRA Related 
Comments 
The burden associated with the 
Transparency in Coverage disclosure 
requirements for HHS is currently 
approved under OMB control number 
0938–1429 (CMS–10715, Transparency 
in Coverage).
169
HHS plans to revise this 
information collection request to 
include the additional burden resulting 
from the proposed requirements. For the 
Departments of Labor and the Treasury, 
the related burden was submitted to 
OMB as Request for Common Form 
(RCF) submissions. Once OMB approves 
the RCF submissions, both DOL and 
Treasury will update and submit their 
respective information collection 
requests to reflect the proposed changes. 
The Departments have submitted a copy 
of these proposed rules to OMB for its 
review of the rule’s information 
collection and recordkeeping 
requirements. These requirements are 
not effective until they have been 
approved by the OMB. 
To obtain copies of the supporting 
statement and any related forms for the 
proposed collections for control number 
0938–1429, please visit CMS’s website 
at https://www.cms.gov/Regulations- and-Guidance/Legislation/Paperwork
ReductionActof1995/PRA-Listing. To obtain copies of the supporting 
statement for control number 0938– 
1429, please go to https://
www.RegInfo.gov or email the request to ebsa.opr@dol.gov and reference control number 0938–1429. 
The Departments invite public 
comment on these potential information 
collection requirements. Commenters 
may send their views on the 
Department’s PRA analysis in the same 
way they send comments in response to 
these proposed rules (for example, 
through the www.regulations.gov 
website), including as part of a comment 
responding to the broader proposed 
rules. 
F. Summary of Ongoing and One-Time 
Burden Estimates for the Proposed 
Requirements 
As shown in Tables 35 and 36, the 
Departments estimate that these 
proposed requirements would result in 
an ongoing burden of approximately 1.4 
million hours annually, at a cost of 
$68.2 million per year for all plans (or 
TPAs on behalf of plans) and issuers. In 
addition, these proposed requirements 
are expected to impose one-time 
implementation costs, totaling 
approximately 6.7 million hours and 
$913.7 million across all plans (TPAs on 
behalf of plans) and issuers. Together, 
this represents a first-year burden of 
roughly 7.8 million hours and $982 
million in associated costs. In 
subsequent years, the burden is 
estimated at about 1.4 million hours and 
$68.2 million per year.

V. Response to Comments 
Because of the large number of public 
comments the Departments normally 
receive on Federal Register documents, 
we are not able to acknowledge or 
respond to them individually. The 
Departments will consider all comments 
we receive by the date and time 
specified in the 
DATESsection of this 
preamble, and, when the Departments 
proceed with a subsequent document, 
the Departments will respond to the 
comments in the preamble to that 
document. 
VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
A. Statement of Need 
These proposed rules would amend 
and strengthen the existing regulations 
under sections 1311(e)(3) and 2715A of 
the PHS Act and be incorporated into 
section 715 of ERISA and section 9815 
to the Code to enhance price 
transparency reporting requirements for 
non-grandfathered group health plans 
and health insurance issuers offering 
non-grandfathered group and individual 
health insurance coverage. Consistent 
with the goals of Executive Order 14221, 
these proposed rules aim to provide 
patients with clear, accurate, and 
actionable pricing information.
170
 
More broadly, these proposed rules 
seek to improve the quality, accuracy, 
and usability of publicly available 
pricing disclosures and cost-sharing 
information for participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees. They also 
address new Federal protections under 
the No Surprises Act and reduce 
duplicative reporting requirements. 
By making pricing data more 
meaningful and accessible, these 
changes are intended to help 
participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees 
better understand their potential costs, 
support more informed decision- 
making, and promote greater 
competition among health care 
providers and insurers.

There are 2,627,159 ERISA-covered group 
health plans, of which 119,485 are self-insured and 
1,476,575 are fully funded. (Based on the 2023

whitehouse.gov/files/omb/circulars/A4/a-4.pdf. 
Act of 1995 (March 22, 1995, Pub. L. 
104–4). 
Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 
direct agencies to assess all costs and 
benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select those regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, 
environmental, public health and safety, 
and other advantages; and distributive 
impacts). 
Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 
defines a ‘‘significant regulatory action’’ 
as any regulatory action that is likely to 
result in a rule that may: (1) have an 
annual effect on the economy of $100 
million or more or adversely affect in a 
material way the economy, a sector of 
the economy, productivity, competition, 
jobs, the environment, public health or 
safety, or State, local, or Tribal 
governments or communities; (2) create 
a serious inconsistency or otherwise 
interfere with an action taken or 
planned by another agency; (3) 
materially alter the budgetary impact of 
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan 
programs or the rights and obligations of 
recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel 
legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, or the President’s priorities, 
or the principles set forth in this 
Executive order. 
A regulatory impact analysis (RIA) 
must be prepared for a regulatory action 
that is significant under Executive Order 
12866. A ‘‘significant regulatory action’’ 
is also subject to review by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB). The 
Departments have concluded that this 
rule is likely to have economic impacts 
of $100 million or more in at least 1 
year. The Departments have provided an 
assessment of the potential costs, 
benefits, and transfers associated with 
this rule. In accordance with the 
provisions of Executive Order 12866, 
this regulation was reviewed by OMB. 
Additionally, tax regulatory actions 
issued by the U.S. Department of the 
Treasury are subject to the requirements 
of section 6 of Executive Order 12866 
pursuant to the Memorandum of 
Agreement (MOA) (July 4, 2025) 
between the Treasury Department and 
OMB regarding review of tax 
regulations. As such, the Treasury 
portions of this rule were also reviewed 
by OMB and are also incorporated into 
this RIA. 
C. Affected Entities 
This section of the preamble 
summarizes the number of plans, 
issuers, and participant, beneficiaries 
and enrollees that would be affected by 
these proposed rules. 
1. Group Health Plans 
These proposed rules would affect 
ERISA-covered group health plans and 
non-Federal governmental group health 
plans. The Departments estimate there 
are approximately 2,600,000 ERISA- 
covered group health plans, of which 
approximately 119,000 are self-insured 
and 1,500,000 are fully funded.
176
The 
Departments also estimate that these 
proposed rules would affect 90,900 non- 
Federal governmental group health 
plans.
177
Of these plans, approximately 
35.7 percent
178
(or 32,400) are self- 
insured,
179
and 64.3 percent (or 58,400) 
are fully funded.
180
 
2. Participants, Beneficiaries, and 
Enrollees 
The Departments estimate that there 
are 135.5 million participants in ERISA- 
covered group health plans, of which 
78.9 million are in self-insured plans 
and 56.6 million are in fully funded 
plans.
181
There are also approximately 
44.5 million participants in non-Federal 
governmental group health plans, of 
which 22.8 million are in self-insured 
plans and 21.5 million are in fully 
funded plans.
182
In addition, roughly 46 
million individuals are covered by 
private direct-purchase health 
insurance.
183
 
3. Issuers and TPAs 
Finally, the Departments estimate that 
these proposed rules would affect 205 
TPAs
184
and 1,375 issuers.
185
The 
Departments assume that fully-insured 
group health plans would rely on health 
insurance issuers. In contrast, self- 
insured group health plans would 
depend on TPAs, including issuers 
providing administrative services only 
and non-issuer TPAs, to implement the 
proposed updates to cost-sharing 
disclosures to participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees, as well as 
to implement the amended public 
disclosure requirements. This 
assumption is based on the 
Departments’ understanding that most 
self-insured group health plans already 
rely on TPAs to perform core 
administrative functions, such as 
enrollment and claims processing.
186
 
The Departments use the term TPA in 
this section of the preamble to refer to 
any other party with which a self- 
insured group health plan has an 
agreement to provide services to meet 
the proposed requirements in these 
proposed rules.

Angela Zhang, Khic-Houy Prang, Nancy 
Devlin, Anthony Scott, et al., The impact of price 
Continued 
storing, and updating very large and 
complex machine-readable files. The 
Departments acknowledge these 
burdens, as well as the underestimation 
of such burdens in the 2020 final rules 
and seek to address them in these 
proposed rules by requiring more 
efficient disclosure formats, clarifying 
data reporting structures and reducing 
duplicative data. While the Departments 
are unable to quantify the extent of the 
underestimation in the 2020 final rules, 
they seek comment on which particular 
burden estimates were underestimated 
and what data sources can be relied 
upon to demonstrate the impact. 
The following sections outline a more 
detailed accounting of the quantified 
and non-quantified benefits and costs 
associated with these proposed rules. 
2. Proposed Requirements for 
Disclosures to Participants, 
Beneficiaries, or Enrollees Under 45 
CFR 147.211 
a. Benefits 
The following paragraphs describe the 
benefits of the proposed revisions to the 
requirement that plans and issuers 
disclose certain cost-sharing 
information to participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees through an 
internet-based self-service tool, 
including making pricing information 
available by phone, and amending the 
disclaimer related to balance-billing 
consistent with balance billing 
protections under the No Surprises Act. 
(1) Informed Consumer 
These proposed amendments would 
enhance consumer access to critical 
cost-sharing information by expanding 
the available delivery methods and 
clarifying their scope. Requiring group 
health plans and issuers to provide cost- 
sharing estimates by phone using a 
phone number found on any physical or 
electronic plan or insurance 
identification (ID) card issued to 
participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees 
for which a consumer may seek 
customer assistance would ensure 
broader accessibility for all participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees, including 
those who prefer or rely on verbal 
communication due to visual 
impairments, limited literacy, or other 
challenges. By expanding access to this 
information, more participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees would be 
empowered to make cost-conscious 
decisions about their health care. In 
addition, the proposed amendments to 
the currently required notice on balance 
billing would provide individuals with 
clearer information about the potential 
for out-of-network providers to charge 
additional amounts not reflected in the 
cost-sharing information provided to the 
individual, including the fact that there 
are protections against balance bills 
under Federal law, as well as to ensure 
that plans and issuers are including this 
notice unless the plans or policies are 
offered in States that categorically 
prohibit balance billing. 
(2) Timely Payment of Medical Bills 
The proposed amended requirements 
are designed to make the cost-sharing 
information disclosed pursuant to these 
proposed rules more accessible to more 
participants, beneficiaries, and 
enrollees, and easier for participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees to 
understand and anticipate their health 
care costs. More transparency around 
potential health care costs by providing 
a new method for delivery of the 
information via the phone and clearer 
information about potential balance 
billing and out-of-pocket costs is 
expected to increase participants’, 
beneficiaries’, and enrollees’ overall 
awareness of their potential health care 
costs. The Departments have 
determined that this increased 
transparency and awareness would help 
participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees 
better anticipate expenses and lead to 
more consistent and timely payment of 
medical bills. A TransUnion survey 
reported that 79 percent of individuals 
would be more likely to pay their 
medical bills promptly if they had out- 
of-pocket costs estimates before 
obtaining care.
188
Additionally, recent 
reports from hospital systems show that 
when patients receive clear, upfront cost 
estimates, they are more likely to make 
payments at the time of service. For 
example, the Surgery Center of 
Oklahoma achieved a 22-fold increase 
in point-of-service collections, from 
about $900,000 in 2007 to $20.5million 
in 2017, after implementing an 
automated cost-estimation tool that 
provided transparent pricing before 
care.
189
Similarly, a Florida-based 
hospital system that adopted real-time 
price estimates experienced a nearly 30 
percent increase in point-of-service 
collections over 2 years.
190
This 
suggests that making cost-sharing 
information disclosures more accessible 
and understandable can support 
patients’ financial planning, promote 
more timely payment of medical bills, 
and provide financial benefits for 
hospitals and other health care 
providers. 
(3) Increased Competition Among 
Providers 
The proposed amendments in these 
proposed rules aim to empower 
consumers to make cost-conscious 
choices among health care providers by 
improving the accessibility and clarity 
of cost-sharing information for 
participants, beneficiaries, and 
enrollees. By requiring plans and issuers 
to provide cost-sharing estimates over 
the phone, in addition to online and in 
paper form, these proposed rules would 
ensure broader access to pricing 
information. In addition, a clearer notice 
about potential balance billing by out- 
of-network providers would further 
enhance transparency and give 
individuals a more complete picture of 
the potential financial obligations 
associated with different providers. 
Evidence suggests that price 
transparency can lead to reduced health 
care costs and increased market 
pressure on higher-cost providers. 
Studies have shown that when 
consumers receive pricing information, 
particularly in combination with 
incentives such as lower cost-sharing, 
cash rewards, or premium reductions, 
they are more likely to choose lower- 
cost options. For example, a price 
transparency initiative that allowed 
consumers to compare MRI prices 
across facilities resulted in nearly a 19 
percent average cost reduction per scan 
(approximately $220 in savings per 
scan) and decreased use of higher-cost 
hospital settings.
191
The study also 
found that price variations between 
hospital and non-hospital facilities for 
MRI scans decreased by 30percent. This 
reduction was mainly driven by 
consumers switching to lower-cost 
options and competitive price 
adjustments by higher-cost facilities. 
Another study found that disclosure of 
negotiated prices stimulated provider 
competition and led to lower prices for 
shoppable services.
192

Deadweight loss refers to the economic 
inefficiency that arises when the consumption of a 
service deviates from the socially optimal level due 
to inaccurate pricing or insufficient information. In 
healthcare, lack of price transparency can lead 
patients to make suboptimal choices, either 
overpaying or postponing care, thereby decreasing 
overall economic welfare for both consumers and 
providers.

support the Departments’ view that 
greater transparency can drive 
competition, encourage cost-conscious 
decision-making, reduce price 
disparities across the health care 
system, and potentially contribute to 
lowering overall health care costs. 
The Departments acknowledge that, 
while price transparency may promote 
competition and reduce costs, some 
studies indicate it may lead to price 
convergence, where lower-cost 
providers raise prices toward the market 
average.
193
This can occur when 
providers observe that competitors 
charge substantially more for the same 
service and adjust their own prices 
upward to capture additional revenue, 
potentially reducing consumer savings. 
(4) Reduced Deadweight Loss
194
 
Through Improved Access to Cost- 
Sharing Information by Phone 
The Departments anticipate that 
requiring plans and issuers to provide 
cost-sharing information by phone 
would help reduce information 
asymmetry in health care markets, 
particularly for individuals who are less 
likely to use online tools, have limited 
internet access or feel less comfortable 
accessing or interpreting information 
over the internet. For example, 
according to the Pew Research Center, 
while 75 percent of those 65 and older 
use the internet generally, less than 61 
percent own a smartphone,
195
and 22 
percent of these adults report never 
going online at all.
196
By improving 
access to real-time, personalized cost- 
sharing data for these populations, this 
proposed requirement could enable 
more consumers to compare prices and 
select lower-cost providers. This shift in 
behavior could reduce overpayment for 
services and better align spending with 
consumers’ willingness to pay, thereby 
decreasing the deadweight loss that 
results from information asymmetry. 
Although quantifying these efficiency 
gains presents methodological 
challenges, economic literature supports 
the notion that improved price 
transparency can lead to behavioral 
changes and welfare improvements.
197
 
The Departments recognize the potential 
for meaningful economic benefits and 
welcome comment and data that could 
inform a more robust estimate of the 
reduction in deadweight loss associated 
with these proposed provisions. 
b. Costs 
Section IV.C. of this preamble 
outlines the quantified costs associated 
with updating cost-sharing disclosures 
to reflect Federal balance billing 
protections, as described in 26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A2(b)(1)(vii)(A), 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A2(b)(1)(vii)(A), and 45 
CFR 147.211(b)(1)(vii)(A). The 
Departments assume that plans and 
issuers have already developed self- 
service tools and would only need to 
revise the disclaimer to state that out-of- 
network providers may engage in 
balance billing, subject to applicable 
State and Federal laws. Although these 
updates build on existing infrastructure, 
the Departments estimate that all plans 
(or TPAs on behalf of plans) and issuers 
would incur a one-time cost for minor 
technical modifications, with a total 
burden of 263 hours and an associated 
cost of approximately $37,657. 
Section IV. of this preamble also 
outlines the quantified costs associated 
with providing the cost-sharing 
information, as described in 26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A2(b)(1), 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A2(b)(1), and 45 CFR 
147.211(b)(1), over the phone, as 
proposed in new paragraph 26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A2(b)(2)(iii), 29 CFR 
2590.715–2715A2(b)(2)(iii), and 45 CFR 
147.211(b)(2)(iii). As discussed in more 
detail in section IV.C. of this preamble, 
the Departments have provided both 
lower impact and higher impact cost 
estimates to account for varying call 
times. The Departments estimate that all 
plans (or TPAs on behalf plans) and 
issuers would incur a total, low-range, 
annual ongoing time burden of 585,000 
hours with an associated estimated cost 
of $23,400,000, and a total, high-range, 
burden of 1,300,000 hours with and 
associated estimated cost of 
$52,000,000, to provide pricing 
information by phone. 
The Departments have determined 
that plans and issuers would leverage 
their existing customer service call 
center infrastructure to provide cost- 
sharing information over the phone in 
order to reduce or eliminate any one- 
time burden and cost. While the 
Departments have determined many 
plans (or TPAs on behalf of plans) and 
issuers already provide some level of 
real-time phone-based cost-sharing 
information, they recognize that some 
plans and issuers may be required to 
alter existing or develop new 
infrastructure and could incur one-time 
burden and cost in order to meet the 
proposed requirements. 
The Departments also anticipate that 
providing phone-based access would 
increase call duration and require plans 
(or TPAs on behalf of plans) and issuers 
to train customer service representatives 
and supervisors, resulting in a one-time 
burden of 290,720 hours and an 
estimated total cost of approximately 
$13,727,040. 
The Departments assume that most 
self-insured group health plans would 
rely on TPAs to fulfill these newly 
proposed requirements and that TPAs 
typically serve multiple clients, 
allowing for economies of scale, which 
could result in a lower burden and cost. 
Additionally, the Departments 
acknowledge that plans and issuers 
might choose to upgrade their 
communication systems voluntarily, 
such as adding mobile call features or 
real-time texting, which could result in 
additional burden or cost reductions. 
The Departments recognize that 
expanding access to personalized 
pricing data, particularly via phone, 
may increase the risk of potential 
exposure of personal health information 
(PHI) and personally identifiable 
information (PII). As with internet-based 
disclosures, additional investments in 
security infrastructure, staff training on 
data protection, and consumer privacy 
tools may be necessary to mitigate the 
risk of unauthorized access or breaches. 
Between 2009 and 2024, there were 
6,759 health care data breaches 
involving 500 or more records reported 
to the Department of Health and Human 
Services Office for Civil Rights, 
compromising the data of over 846 
million individuals (an average of more 
than 2.6 per member of the U.S 
population). Notably, in 2024 alone, 
nearly 277 million individuals were 
affected, with an average of over

As a 
result, complying with these provisions 
may necessitate additional safeguards to 
protect PHI and PII during phone-based 
interactions. 
The Departments seek comment on 
these burden and cost estimates, 
including assumptions on disclosures to 
reflect Federal balance billing 
protections, call duration, customer 
service staffing, and the extent to which 
plans (or TPAs on behalf of plans) and 
issuers are already equipped to provide 
real-time cost-sharing information by 
phone. 
While not quantified in this analysis, 
the Departments acknowledge that State 
regulators may incur administrative 
costs to review, monitor, or enforce 
compliance with these additional 
requirements. The Departments seek 
comment on any potential State-level 
impacts and any other burdens and 
costs that could be incurred by entities 
that would be affected by the provision 
of these proposals. 
3. Proposed Requirements for Public 
Disclosure Under 26 54.9815–2715A3, 
29 CFR 2590.715–2715A3, and 45 CFR 
147.212 
The following paragraphs describe the 
quantified and non-quantified benefits 
of the proposed requirements to disclose 
information related to in-network rates 
and historical out-of-network allowed 
amounts through machine-readable 
files. 
a. Quantified Benefits 
(1) Reduced Data Cleaning and 
Integration Costs for Third-Party 
Developers and Other File Users 
The Departments have determined 
that by reducing the complexity and 
inconsistency of data that currently 
require extensive data processing and 
reconciliation, these proposed rules 
would make machine-readable data both 
easier to locate and easier to process for 
third-party developers and other file 
users, such as academics, researchers, 
data engineers, and plans and issuers. 
These proposed rules would do this by 
requiring plans and issuers to publish 
contextual files including a Change-log 
File, Taxonomy File, and a Utilization 
File; report at the network rather than 
the plan or policy level; exclude 
providers that have in-network rates for 
items or services for which they are 
unlikely to be reimbursed; add 
enrollment numbers, common network 
names, and product types; and 
standardize file locations with a Text 
File and footer links. The Departments 
anticipate that much of the burden 
currently involved in cleaning and 
processing the machine-readable files 
would be eliminated, since the files 
would contain more accurate data in 
smaller sizes. This would reduce the 
time and resources third-party 
developers and other file users spend 
removing duplicative and irrelevant 
data, which in turn would decrease the 
computational resources required for 
data cleaning and integration, further 
reducing overall costs. 
In particular, the Departments 
estimate that the proposed provisions to 
require network-level reporting, add 
enrollment numbers, and specify 
product types would meaningfully 
reduce data cleaning and integration 
costs for approximately 300 third-party 
developers and other file users,
199
 
including research shops and 
consultancies. Specifically, network- 
level reporting is expected to save about 
40 hours per quarterly reporting cycle, 
or 160 hours annually. Providing 
enrollment data directly in the files 
would remove the need for third-party 
sourcing and integration, saving another 
40 hours each year, while the inclusion 
of product types would save an 
estimated 20 hours per quarterly cycle, 
or 80 hours annually. Together, these 
provisions would reduce about 280 
hours of analyst time per year for each 
third-party developer or other file user. 
Using an average hourly wage of $120 
for a Business Analyst,
200
the total 
estimated annual labor savings across 
all 300 third-party developers and other 
file users would be approximately $10.1 
million.
201
 
In addition, by requiring plans and 
issuers to exclude provider-rate 
combinations for items and services for 
which a provider would be unlikely to 
be reimbursed, the Departments 
estimate a substantial reduction in the 
data volume that would be disclosed, 
compared to current volumes, leading to 
lower computational costs when 
processing the files. Assuming industry- 
wide disclosures currently total roughly 
1,000,000 gigabytes (GB), equivalent to 
1 PB 
202
in size per month, the proposed 
exclusion of these provider-rate 
combinations would reduce file sizes by 
about 70 percent
203
to a new estimated 
size of 300,000 GBs. While most actual 
savings would be associated with 
algorithms that are processing the data, 
which would reflect much higher actual 
computation savings, an absolute 
baseline can still be established. 
Assuming an average compute cost of 
$0.015 per GB RAM-hour for general 
purpose usage,
204
the baseline monthly 
compute cost for 1 PB is estimated at 
roughly $334
205
with an annual cost of 
$4,008. With a 70 percent reduction in 
file size, monthly compute costs would 
decrease to approximately $100, 
yielding a monthly savings of $234, 
which corresponds to an estimated 
annual savings of approximately $2,808 
per third-party developer or other file 
user. Across 300 third-party developers 
and other file users, this equates to total 
annual savings of approximately 
$842,400. 
These proposed rules would also shift 
the reporting frequency from monthly to 
quarterly for In-network Rate and 
Allowed Amount Files, reducing the 
total computational needs accordingly. 
This change reduces total annual 
downloads from 3,600 (300 third-party 
developers and users × 12 months) to 1,200 (300 third-party developers and 
users × 4 months), or an average of 100 downloads per month to be processed. 
Under quarterly reporting, the estimated 
annual industry-wide computational 
costs for the optimized files would be 
$120,000.
206
Relative to the monthly 
baseline, this cadence change combined 
with the file-size reduction yield 
$1,082,400 in total annual compute 
savings. Of this amount, approximately

208
This is calculated by multiplying the current 
yearly cost to download multiplied by the number 
of third-party developers and other file users: 
$270,996 × 300 = $81,298,800. 209
This figure is calculated by multiplying the 
annual cost per user after the file-size reduction 
($79,812) by the number of third-party developers 
and other file users (300): $79,812 × 300 = $23,943,600. 
210
Annual storage savings of $57,355,200 is 
calculated by subtracting the total annual cost after 
file-size reduction ($23,943,600) from the total 
annual cost under current file-size assumptions 
($81,298,800): $81,298,800¥$23,943,600 = 
$57,355,200. 
211
This is calculated by multiplying the reduced 
monthly storage cost ($6,651) by 4 quarterly reports 
and 300 third-party developers and other files: 
$6,651 × 4 × 300 = $7,981,200. 212
This is calculated by subtracting the total 
storage costs for the new, quarterly file downloads 
($7,981,200) from the total storage costs for the 
current monthly downloads ($81,298,800): 
$81,298,800¥$7,981,200 = $73,317,600.

pricing/on-demand/ (last accessed Oct. 1, 2025). 214
At current file sizes, data transfer cost 
estimates are approximately $53,800 per month for 
1 PB data. The Departments assume that 300 third- 
party developers and other file users each 
download one file per month (12 annually), 
resulting in 3,600 total downloads per year. Based 
on a cost of $53,800 per download, the estimated 
annual cost is approximately $193,680,000 ($53,800 
× 3,600). $842,400 of compute savings is 
attributable to file-size optimization, 
while an additional $240,000 results 
from the reduction in reporting 
frequency. 
The Departments have determined 
that together these proposed provisions 
would result in total annual savings of 
roughly $11.2 million ($10.1 million in 
labor savings plus $1.1 million in 
industry-wide storage cost savings from 
the shift to quarterly reporting) for third- 
party developers and other users of 
price transparency data, while 
supporting the intended goal of making 
price data more usable and actionable. 
The Departments seek comment on 
the estimated potential cost and time 
savings from streamlining and 
standardizing the machine-readable 
files, and on whether these proposed 
provisions would effectively result in 
reduced data processing burdens and 
costs for users. 
(2) Reduced Storage Costs for Plans, 
Issuers, Third-Party Developers, and 
Other Files Users 
The proposed provisions would lead 
to reduced storage costs for plans, 
issuers, third-party developers, and 
other users by significantly decreasing 
the total volume of data needed to 
generate, store, and make available for 
download. These proposals would 
minimize data duplication and reduce 
both the number and size of the 
machine-readable files by changing the 
reporting cadence for both the In- 
network Rate File and the Allowed 
Amount File from monthly to quarterly, 
requiring reporting of negotiated rates at 
the network level rather than the plan 
or policy level, and excluding provider- 
rate combinations in the In-network 
Rate File for certain items and services. 
The Departments have determined 
that these changes could lower ongoing 
storage, backup, and processing costs for 
the In-network Rate File, making it 
easier and more cost-effective for third- 
party users to download and build and 
manage consumer-facing price 
comparison tools based on the machine- 
readable data. Further, the Departments 
anticipate some users would opt not to 
download and store all of the new In- 
network Rate Files, given the Change- 
log File would identify changes in data 
from one In-network Rate File to the 
next, further decreasing data storage and 
processing costs. 
Researchers have estimated that the 
combined monthly file sizes across 
industry for the In-network Rate Files 
are over 1 PB. The Departments estimate 
that the proposed changes would reduce 
file sizes by approximately 70 percent, 
lowering the monthly data volume from 
about 1,000,000 GB to approximately 
300,000 GB. 
Using Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
S3 pricing as a benchmark, $0.023 per 
GB for the first 50 TB, $0.022 per GB for 
the next 450 TB, and $0.021 per GB 
beyond that,
207
storing 1 PB worth of 
data would result in an estimated 
baseline monthly storage cost of roughly 
$22,583 with an annual cost of 
approximately $270,996. With a 70 
percent reduction in file size, monthly 
storage costs would decrease to 
approximately $6,651 ($79,812 
annually), yielding a monthly savings of 
$15,932 and an estimated annual 
savings of approximately $191,184. 
These cost savings would apply for all 
plans and issuers. 
Assuming 300 third-party developers 
and other file users download the files 
each month, total annual storage costs 
under current file size assumptions 
would be approximately $81,298,800.
208
 
With the 70 percent file-size reduction, 
the annual cost for all 300 third-party 
developers and other file users would 
drop to $23,943,600.
209
This results in 
an annual storage savings of roughly 
$57,355,200
210
for the 300 third-party 
developers and other files users based 
on file-size optimizations. 
However, because these proposed 
rules also shift the reporting frequency 
from monthly to quarterly, total storage 
needs and corresponding savings would 
be reduced accordingly. Under quarterly 
reporting, annual industry-wide storage 
cost for the reduced file size for the In- 
network Rate Files savings is estimated 
at $7,981,200.
211
Relative to the 
monthly baseline, this cadence change 
combined with the file-size reduction 
yield about $73,317,600 in total annual 
savings.
212
Of this amount, 
approximately $57,355,200 in storage 
savings can be attributed to file-size 
optimization, while an additional 
$15,962,400 can be attributed to the 
reduction in reporting frequency. 
The Departments seek comment on 
the assumptions made and the 
estimated storage cost savings for plans 
and issuers, third-party developers, and 
other users from reducing data volume. 
(3) Reduced Network Egress Costs for 
Plans and Issuers 
In addition to the estimated savings 
from reduced storage requirements, the 
Departments anticipate that the 
proposed provisions would also lead to 
a reduction of bandwidth network costs 
for plans and issuers needed with 
making their machine-readable files 
available for download. 
Using the estimates developed and 
discussed in the preceding section for 
the In-network Rate File, and applying 
AWS egress costs, which are fees for 
data transferred from AWS to the public 
internet, as a benchmark—the first 100 
GB are free, followed by $0.09 per GB 
for the first 50 TB, $0.085 per GB for the 
next 40 TB, $0.07 per GB for the next 
100 TB, and $0.05 per GB for any 
amount exceeding 150 TB.
213
The 
Departments estimate a monthly tiered 
egress cost of transferring 1 PB data 
would be approximately $53,800 with 
an estimated annual cost of roughly 
$645,600. With a 70 percent reduction 
in file size to 300,000 GB, monthly data 
transfer egress costs would decrease to 
about $18,795, with estimated annual 
costs of approximately $225,600. This 
would yield a monthly savings of 
$35,005 and annual cost savings of 
approximately $420,060 for all plans 
and issuers. These cost estimates 
assume a single data transfer, or 
download, each month. 
Because files would not be 
downloaded just once, the Departments 
would also estimate the number of users 
that would download the entire data set 
each month. Assuming 300 third-party 
developers and other file users 
download the files each month, total 
annual egress costs under current file 
size assumption would be nearly $194 
million.
214
With the optimized file size 
estimates, the costs would be reduced 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  19:30 Dec 22, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\23DEP4.SGM 23DEP4
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS460497 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules 215
This is calculated as follows: Estimated size 
data transfer cost estimates for optimized files are 
$18,795 per month for transferring 300,000 GB. The 
Departments assume that 300 third-party 
developers and other file users each download one 
file per month (3,600 downloads each year). At this 
rate, the total annual cost is estimated at 
$67,662,000 ($18,795 × 3,600). 216
Estimated annual size data transfer cost 
savings are calculated by subtracting the total 
annual cost for the optimized 300TB files 
($67,662,000) from the total annual cost for the 
original 1PB files ($193,680,000): 
$193,680,000¥$67,662,000 = $126,018,000. 
217
Total network costs for transferring new files 
(300,000 GB) on a quarterly basis are calculated by 
multiplying the monthly cost per file transfer 
($18,795) by the total annual downloads (1,200): 
$18,795 × 1,200 downloads per year = $22,554,000. 218
Total network cost savings are calculated by 
subtracting the total annual network costs for the 
new files downloaded quarterly ($22,554,000) from 
the total annual costs for the current monthly 
downloads ($193,680,000): 
$193,680,000¥$22,554,000 = $171,126,000. 
219
The estimated 10 hours saved annually per 
organization is based on the assumption that, for 
each update, organizations review the prior month’s 
links to locate files, and only a subset of those files 
requires additional effort to determine their posting 
location.

Intelligence Suite, CALC information and wage 
rates, https://buy.gsa.gov/pricing/ (last visited Dec. 8, 2025). 
221
The total annual labor savings estimate is 
derived as follows: each of the approximately 300 
third-party developers and other file users is 
estimated to save 10 hours of labor per quarterly 
reporting cycle as a result of the proposed 
standardized Text file and footer link, which 
facilitate easier file location. With four reporting 
cycles per year, this equates to 40 hours saved 
annually per third-party developer or other file 
user. Applying an average hourly wage for a 
Business Analyst of $120 results in an estimated 
annual savings of approximately $4,800 per third- 
party developer or other file user (40 hours × $120). When aggregated across the estimated 300 third- 
party developers and other file users, the total 
annual labor savings amount to approximately 
$1,440,000. 
by about $68 million annually,
215
 
yielding total industry-wide savings of 
$126 million annually.
216
 
Similar to reduced storage costs for 
plans and issuers discussed in section 
VI.D.3.a.(2). of this preamble, these 
proposed rules would also shift the 
reporting frequency from monthly to 
quarterly, which reduces total egress 
needs and corresponding savings. This 
change reduces total annual downloads 
from 3,600 (300 third-party developers 
and other file users × 12 months) to 1,200 (300 third-party developers and 
other file users × 4 months), or an average of 100 downloads per month. 
Under quarterly reporting, annual 
industry-wide egress costs for the 
optimized files would be about $22.6 
million.
217
Relative to the monthly 
baseline, this cadence change combined 
with the file-size reduction would yield 
about $171 million in total annual 
savings.
218
Of this amount, 
approximately $126 million egress 
savings would be attributable to file-size 
optimization, while an additional $45 
million would result from the reduction 
in reporting frequency. 
The Departments seek comment on 
the assumptions made and anticipated 
egress cost savings for plans and issuers 
from reducing data volume and 
reporting cadence. 
(4) Reduced Time Locating the Files 
for Third-party Developers and Other 
File Users 
The Departments’ proposal to require 
plans and issuers to include a 
standardized Text File and place a 
direct link to the files in the website 
footer would make it easier for third- 
party developers and other file users, 
who currently face challenges 
navigating plan or issuer websites to 
find their machine-readable files, to 
more efficiently locate and access the 
data needed for their applications and 
analyses. 
The time savings from locating files 
primarily stem from the proposed 
requirement that plans and issuers 
include a standardized Text File that 
includes, among other things, the source 
page URL for the internet website that 
hosts the machine-readable files, and a 
footer link in certain prominent 
locations that links directly to the web 
page that hosts the link to the machine- 
readable files. Additionally, the 
proposed change from monthly to 
quarterly reporting would reduce the 
number of times a file user would need 
to locate the In-network Rate and 
Allowed Amount Files to find updated 
information. Together, the Departments 
estimate that these changes would save 
about 10 hours
219
of labor quarterly (or 
40 hours annually) for each third-party 
developer or file user, reflecting the 
reduced need to manually track down 
and verify file locations. Using an 
average hourly wage of $120 for a 
Business Analyst,
220
the Departments 
estimate that total annual labor savings 
for all third-party developers and other 
file users would amount to 
approximately $1.4 million.
221
The 
Departments seek comment on the 
assumptions and estimated burden and 
cost savings from making the machine- 
readable files easier to locate through 
standardized links. 
The Departments have determined 
that the provisions of these proposed 
rules would help reduce administrative 
complexity and advance the objective of 
making price transparency data more 
accessible, efficient, and actionable for 
participants, beneficiaries, and 
enrollees. 
As shown in Table 38, the proposed 
provisions are estimated to generate 
total annual benefits of approximately 
$257 million for plans, issuers, third- 
party developers, and other users.

b. Non-Quantified Benefits 
(1) Stronger Market Leverage for Plans 
and Issuers 
By requiring more streamlined, 
meaningful, and clear disclosure of in- 
network rates and detailed out-of- 
network data, the provisions in these 
proposed rules would better enable 
plans and issuers to compare their in- 
network rates and out-of-network 
coverage with those of competitors. The 
addition of contextual files, including 
the Taxonomy File, Utilization File, and 
Change-log File, would enhance the 
practical value of this data, helping 
plans and issuers see not just raw prices 
but also provider specialties, actual in- 
network utilization, and historical 
changes in rate information. This would 
support plans and issuers in identifying 
gaps, trends, and outliers within their 
own networks and relative to the 
market. This enhanced transparency 
might strengthen their ability to 
negotiate lower reimbursement rates 
with providers based on knowing what 
those providers have negotiated with 
other payers that are similarly situated 
within the market for the same items or 
services with other plans and issuers 
that are similarly situated within the 
market. However, as noted in section 
VI.D.2.a.(3). of this preamble, the 
Departments also recognize the 
potential for this information to drive 
rates up if providers learn they are being 
paid less than other providers and use 
that information to seek higher 
negotiated rates. 
By enhancing the transparency of out- 
of-network allowed amounts and 
historic billed charges, these provisions 
might facilitate broader adoption of 
private health insurance market 
reference-based pricing strategies. 
Specifically, the proposed requirements 
related to the Allowed Amount File 
would provide the public with clearer 
information on what out-of-network 
providers charge. This additional 
transparency could help plans and 
issuers, and other consumers, better 
identify lower-cost providers and 
benchmark reasonable prices, ultimately 
supporting strategies where 
participants, beneficiaries, or enrollees 
pay the difference when selecting 
higher-cost providers in circumstances 
where they have a meaningful choice 
among providers. Plans and issuers may 
use such reference-based pricing 
structures to guide participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees toward 
lower-cost providers. While the 
Departments recognize that reference- 
based pricing may not apply uniformly 
(for example, some plans offer 
exemptions based on clinical need or 
geographic limitations), it has generally 
led to cost reductions. For instance, 
combining price transparency with 
reference pricing has led to significant 
shifts in consumer choice of facility, 
resulting in a 27 percent reduction in 
the average price paid per laboratory 
test and a 13 percent reduction in the 
average price paid per imaging test.
222
 
(2) Enhanced Regulatory Oversight and 
Inform Policymaking 
The Departments expect that State 
and Federal regulators could gain 
efficiencies and increased insights from 
the data reporting pursuant to the 
amended disclosure requirements in 
these proposed rules. The proposals 
would give regulators access to more 
streamlined, usable, and actionable in- 
network rate and out-of-network data, 
which may support more informed 
oversight of premium rate filings by 
enabling more effective monitoring of 
market trends and price variations. The 
proposals may also help States monitor 
rates to identify collusive behaviors, as 
well as help establish benchmarks for 
negotiations with providers as part of 
State oversight activities related to 
coverage programs, ultimately 
strengthening regulatory oversight and 
promoting more competitive markets. 
(3) Increased Understanding and 
Empowered Consumers 
These proposals aim to empower 
participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees 
by increasing transparency around what 
plans and issuers reimburse providers 
for covered items and services. By 
providing access to clearer, more 
streamlined, and more specific in- 
network rates, historical out-of-network 
allowed amounts, and billed charges, 
file users and ultimately health care 
consumers might be better equipped to 
understand how their choices of 
coverage and providers affect their 
costs. This transparency may support 
more informed consumer decision- 
making when comparing plans or 
selecting providers. Adding supporting 
contextual information to accompany 
the data is expected to enhance overall 
usability for third-party developers and 
other file users. As stated in the 
preamble to the 2020 final rules, the 
Departments expected third-party 
developers and other innovators to use 
the machine-readable file data to create 
‘‘easy-to-use internet-based tools and 
mobile applications that will present 
information to laypersons in easy-to- 
understand, plain language that is 
sufficiently concise and well- 
organized,’’
223
which would allow 
‘‘consumers to consider price as a factor 
when making meaningful comparisons 
between different coverage options and 
providers.’’
224
The Departments are 
encouraged by the consumer-facing 
tools that have been built since 
implementation of the 2020 final rules 
and look forward to additional growth 
in this space following implementation 
of the enhancements in these proposed 
rules. 
c. Costs 
This section of the preamble provides 
both quantitative and qualitative 
discussion of the costs associated with 
the Departments’ proposed revisions to 
the requirements that plans and issuers 
make information regarding in-network 
negotiated rates and out-of-network 
allowed amounts available through 
machine-readable files on a public 
website. The Department request 
comment and data on how to better 
quantify these costs. 
Section IV.D. of this preamble 
outlines the quantified costs associated 
with requirements for public disclosure 
of in-network rates and allowed amount 
data for covered items and services from 
in- and out-of-network providers, as 
described under 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3, 29 CFR 2590.715–2715A3, and 
45 CFR 147.212. 
For In-network Rate Files, this 
proposal would require plans and 
issuers to create a separate file for each 
provider network, allow rates to be 
expressed as a percentage of billed 
charges when appropriate, include 
enrollment totals for each plan or 
coverage option, disclose provider 
network product types, and exclude 
providers unlikely to be reimbursed 
based on their scope of practice. The 
Departments estimate that all plans (or 
TPAs on behalf of plans) and issuers 
would incur a one-time burden of 
717,952 hours on the low end and 
758,400 hours on the high end, with 
associated costs of approximately 
$102,371,360 and $108,084,640, 
respectively. While these proposals 
would involve a one-time cost to modify 
existing processes, the Departments 
expect that, once these updates are 
implemented, the ongoing burden 
related to including product type, 
excluding certain providers, reporting 
dollar amounts (except for ‘‘percentage- 
of-billed-charges’’ payments), including 
enrollment data, organizing files by 
provider network, and allowing service

providers to organize files across 
multiple self-insured plans would be 
minimal, beyond current costs for 
monitoring and maintaining these 
processes. 
For Allowed Amount Files, the 
proposal includes requiring data 
reporting at the market level instead of 
the individual plan level, lowering the 
claims threshold from 20 to 11, 
extending the reporting period from 90 
days to 6 months, and increasing the 
lookback period from 180 days to 9 
months to enhance the robustness of 
historical data. The Departments 
estimate that all plans (or TPAs on 
behalf of plans) and issuers would incur 
a one-time burden of 101,120 hours, 
with associated costs of approximately 
$14,283,200. While lowering the claims 
threshold to 11 is expected to require 
only minor system adjustments, the 
Departments anticipate minimal 
ongoing costs for maintaining and 
monitoring compliance. Similarly, 
extending the lookback period is not 
expected to impose a significant 
additional burden, as automated 
systems are already in place to report 
out-of-network allowed amounts for the 
90-day reporting period beginning 180 
days before publication. Ongoing costs 
for aggregating out-of-network Allowed 
Amount Files by market type are also 
expected to be minimal. 
In addition, these proposed rules 
would require plans and issuers to post 
several contextual machine-readable 
files: a Change-log File, a Utilization 
File, a Taxonomy File, and a Text File, 
each with specific update and posting 
requirements. The Departments estimate 
a one-time burden of 5,548,960 hours 
for plans (or TPAs on behalf of plans) 
and issuers, with associated costs of 
approximately $777,578,040 to add and 
implement these files, with an ongoing 
annual burden of 60,040 hours (costing 
approximately $9,186,120) to update the 
Utilization File and 47,400 hours 
(costing approximately $7,015,200) to 
address point-of-contact inquiries to 
improve discoverability and 
accessibility of the machine-readable 
files. The Change-log File is expected to 
be fully automated, and the 
Departments anticipate only minimal 
system maintenance beyond the initial 
generation and posting of the file. 
Similarly, once the initial setup for 
adding a Text File is complete, ongoing 
updates are expected to require minimal 
effort. The Departments also assume 
that including a link to the internet 
domain hosting the machine-readable 
files on the website footer would result 
in minimal additional burden. 
(1) Non-Quantified Costs for Public 
Disclosure of In-Network Provider Rates 
The proposed provisions are expected 
to introduce meaningful improvements 
to the quality, clarity, and usability of 
In-network Rate Files, such as requiring 
files to be organized by provider 
network rather than by plan or policy, 
allowing for percentage-of-billed 
charges reporting when the dollar 
amount is not known in advance, 
adding contextual files like Taxonomy, 
Utilization, and Change-log files, and 
excluding certain provider-rate 
combinations if it is unlikely that a 
provider would be reimbursed for an 
item or service given that provider’s 
area of specialty. While these 
improvements aim to help file users, 
tool developers, and regulators better 
navigate and interpret rate data, they 
may also create non-quantified 
operational and market-level costs for 
plans and issuers. 
Specifically, plans and issuers could 
face additional administrative and 
compliance costs from producing and 
maintaining stricter standardized 
machine-readable files. This may 
involve internal quality reviews, greater 
coordination across business units, as 
well as potential redesign of existing 
automated processes to create network- 
specific files and incorporate new 
required data fields. 
There is also a risk that improving the 
transparency of negotiated rates may 
cause some providers to raise their 
prices if they discover they are paid less 
than their peers. This response could 
contribute to price convergence rather 
than sustained downward pressure on 
costs, an effect observed in some 
transparency studies, where high prices 
fall slightly but lower prices rise, 
ultimately reducing overall savings. For 
instance, one study found that although 
price transparency has helped narrow 
price variation in health care, it has not 
consistently lowered overall prices. 
According to the study, the highest 
prices fell by 6.3 percent, while the 
lowest prices rose by 3.4 percent, and 
mid-range prices decreased only slightly 
by 1.1 percent.
225
While the study does 
not address the effect on average prices, 
these findings suggest that transparency 
can pressure high-cost providers to 
reduce prices but may also lead lower- 
cost providers to increase prices. A 2020 
study also suggests that price 
transparency could facilitate tactical 
collusion, resulting in higher prices in 
markets that are not perfectly 
competitive, such as health care. In 
these markets, there are fewer sellers 
and higher barriers to entry for new 
competitors.
226
 
Another potential cost stemming from 
increased transparency due to 
improvements in In-network Rate Files 
is the impact on a plan’s or issuer’s 
ability or incentive to develop and 
maintain a robust provider network. A 
provider network consists of health care 
providers that have entered into 
agreements with plans or issuers to 
deliver care at a negotiated rate, which 
the provider accepts as full payment. 
Plans and issuers often prefer their 
participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees 
to use in-network providers, as these 
providers meet the health plan’s quality 
standards and agree to lower rates in 
exchange for the patient volume they 
will receive by being part of the 
network.
227
Some plans and issuers use 
narrow networks, which include a more 
limited group of providers. While these 
networks offer fewer in-network options 
to participants, beneficiaries and 
enrollees, they often result in lower 
monthly premiums and reduced out-of- 
pocket costs.
228
The Departments 
recognize that publicly disclosing 
negotiated rates may reduce the 
incentive for providers to enter into 
such contractual agreements, 
particularly in narrow networks, if they 
know those rates will be made public or 
they are being offered lower than market 
rates. This could, in turn, limit network 
options available to plans and issuers. 
Smaller issuers may be 
disproportionately affected by the 
improved transparency of negotiated 
rates, as they may be unable to match 
the higher rates that larger issuers can 
offer. In turn, smaller issuers may be 
forced to contract only with lower-cost 
providers, potentially leading to 
narrower networks and affecting 
participant, beneficiary, and enrollee 
access to care. Such network constraints 
may also make it more difficult for these 
issuers to fully comply with network 
adequacy standards described at 45 CFR 
156.230 or applicable State standards. 
Ultimately, while the purpose of

improving price transparency is to 
empower participants, beneficiaries, 
and enrollees and enhance market 
efficiency, the Departments 
acknowledge that these proposed 
provisions could, in some cases, reduce 
the ability or incentive of plans and 
issuers, especially smaller ones, to build 
and maintain robust networks that 
satisfy quality and access requirements. 
(2) Non-Quantified Costs for Public 
Disclosure of Out-of-Network Allowed 
Amounts 
The Departments recognize the 
potential costs arising from the 
proposed expansion of data in the 
Allowed Amount Files. These may 
include the increased complexity and 
administrative burden of managing and 
reporting a larger volume of data over 
extended reporting and lookback 
periods, as well as at the broader health 
insurance market level rather than at the 
plan or policy level. Additionally, to 
account for the expanded handling of 
detailed claims data, plans and issuers 
might face additional expenses for 
enhanced cybersecurity measures and 
compliance with data privacy 
regulations. These potential costs are 
difficult to quantify given current data 
limitations, but the Departments 
acknowledge that they represent 
important considerations associated 
with implementing these proposed 
provisions. 
The Departments seek comment and 
data on the potential magnitude of these 
non-quantified costs, including legal, 
operational, and network impacts, and 
how they may affect plan and issuer 
implementation and that may assist the 
Departments’ estimate on any related 
additional burden and cost. 
4. Summary of Transfers 
The requirements of these proposed 
rules, as discussed in section III. of this 
preamble, require plans and issuers to 
enhance the accuracy and usability of 
pricing information through improved 
machine-readable files, expand cost- 
sharing disclosure methods (including 
phone access), and streamline reporting 
requirements. As a result of the 
proposed requirements, the 
Departments expect various transfers, 
discussed in this section of the 
preamble, to occur between plans and 
issuers; providers; participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees; and the 
Federal government. While the precise 
magnitude of these transfers is difficult 
to quantify due to varying market 
conditions and consumer behaviors, the 
directional effects and distributional 
impacts can be analyzed conceptually. 
a. Transfer From Higher-Cost to Lower- 
Cost Providers 
If participants, beneficiaries, and 
enrollees gain easier access to pricing 
information through enhanced machine- 
readable files and phone-based cost- 
sharing estimates, some consumers 
might switch from higher-cost to lower- 
cost providers for comparable services. 
This transfer occurs as consumer cost 
preferences result in shifts from 
providers who charge what consumers 
feel are above-market rates, to those 
offering what the consumer feels to be 
more competitive pricing. The 
magnitude of this transfer would 
depend on several factors: the degree of 
price variation between providers, 
consumer price sensitivity, and the 
consumer’s relationships between those 
providers. 
Some evidence shows that in 
competitive markets, price ranges may 
narrow as lower-cost providers raise 
their prices to align with higher-cost 
competitors, potentially increasing 
costs.
229
Disclosing negotiated rates can 
enable providers to match each other’s 
prices, which may further limit cost 
reductions or even lead to higher overall 
prices despite the increased 
transparency.
230
However, in some 
instances, increased transparency could 
lead higher-cost providers to face new 
pressure to lower costs, potentially 
decreasing costs.
231
The Departments 
acknowledge that this transfer may be 
partially offset by potential price 
convergence effects, where lower-cost 
providers may increase their prices 
toward market averages once pricing 
becomes more transparent. However, 
the net effect is expected to favor more 
efficient providers and create 
competitive pressure for cost reduction 
across the market. 
b. Transfer From Providers to 
Consumers Through Reduced Out-of- 
Pocket Spending 
If consumers use enhanced pricing 
information to select lower-cost 
providers, their out-of-pocket expenses 
for health care services are expected to 
decrease, representing a transfer from 
the provider to the consumer. This 
transfer is facilitated by the proposed 
requirement to make cost-sharing 
information available by phone, which 
might particularly benefit populations 
who face barriers to using online tools, 
including older adults, individuals with 
disabilities, and those with limited 
internet access. By expanding access to 
personalized pricing information, these 
consumers might make more cost- 
conscious health care decisions, 
resulting in lower deductibles, 
copayments, and coinsurance amounts. 
The magnitude of this transfer could 
vary significantly based on individual 
utilization patterns, plan design, and the 
availability of lower-cost alternatives 
within their provider networks. This 
shift is consistent with empirical 
findings that greater price transparency 
can help consumers make more cost- 
effective choices and encourage market 
competition.
232
 
c. Transfer From Plans and Issuers to 
Participants, Beneficiaries, and 
Enrollees Through Potential Premium 
Reductions 
If enhanced price transparency leads 
to systematic shifts toward lower-cost 
providers and overall reductions in 
health care spending, plans and issuers 
may experience lower claims costs, 
which could eventually translate to 
reduced premiums for participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees. That is, as 
plans and issuers experience lower 
medical costs due to participant, 
beneficiary, and enrollee price 
shopping, competitive pressure may 
lead to premium reductions to attract 
and retain enrollees. However, the 
magnitude of this transfer would 
depend on several factors, including the 
degree of competition across different 
market segments and geographic areas 
(for example, urban vs. rural markets) 
and the rate in which consumer 
utilization patterns change. 
d. Transfer From Premium Tax Credit 
(PTC) Eligible Consumers to Federal 
Government Through Reduced PTC 
If enhanced price transparency leads 
to lower premiums in the individual 
insurance market, consumers eligible for 
PTCs would receive smaller subsidy 
amounts, resulting in a transfer from 
consumers to the Federal government. 
This transfer would occur if, through 
the use of transparency tools, premiums 
in the individual market declined

(including the second lowest-cost silver 
benchmark plan) and thus resulted in a 
reduction in Federal spending through 
reduced PTC amounts. The magnitude 
of this transfer would depend on the 
extent to which price transparency leads 
to substantial competitive pressure, 
overall premium reductions, and the 
number of PTC-eligible consumers 
affected. For subsidized consumers, the 
net effect may be largely neutral, since 
their required premium contributions 
are based on income rather than plan 
cost; however, if they choose a lower- 
cost plan as premiums decrease, they 
could experience a net benefit. On the 
other hand, unsubsidized consumers 
would generally see a positive impact 
from any premium reductions. 
e. Transfer From Federal Government to 
Consumers Through Increased PTCs 
If the costs associated with enhanced 
transparency requirements contribute to 
premium increases, for example, 
through price convergence, this could 
result in higher PTC payments to 
eligible consumers, representing a 
transfer from the Federal government to 
consumers. This transfer could also 
occur if the costs of implementing 
enhanced machine-readable file 
requirements, phone-based cost-sharing 
tools, and other transparency measures 
result in increased premiums. The 
magnitude and direction of this transfer 
is uncertain due to the variation in 
market responses; however, these 
proposed rules are designed to reduce 
administrative burden and streamline 
reporting requirements and thus reduce 
premiums and overall costs. 
The Departments acknowledge 
uncertainty in both the magnitude and 
timing of these potential transfers. 
Market responses to price transparency 
efforts might vary widely based on local 
competitive conditions, consumer 
behavior patterns, provider networks, 
and the specific design of transparency 
tools. This analysis focuses on 
directional effects and distributional 
considerations rather than precise 
quantification, given the limited 
empirical evidence on the specific 
transparency enhancements proposed in 
this rule, and evidence indicates that, 
while transparency may create 
competitive pressure and encourage cost 
reductions, the net effects on prices and 
transfers remain uncertain.
233
Price 
transparency can influence consumer 
decision-making, potentially 
encouraging shifts toward lower-cost 
providers;
234
however, in markets that 
are not perfectly competitive, it can 
sometimes lead to price alignment or 
collusion, which may increase prices 
rather than lower them.
235
 
The Departments seek comment on 
the potential transfers described 
previously, including any potential 
transfers from higher-cost providers to 
participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees 
and issuers resulting from improved 
price transparency, as well as any 
possible impacts resulting from the 
potential for provider collusions and 
price convergence. 
5. Uncertainty Analysis 
The Departments recognize that the 
assumptions underlying the estimated 
costs and benefits described in sections 
VI.D.2.b. and VI.D.3.a. of this preamble 
involve a degree of uncertainty. 
Differences in plan and issuer size, 
internal systems, and workflows may 
affect the resources required to 
implement the proposed requirements. 
The quality, structure, and reporting 
practices of existing files could also 
shape the extent of savings realized by 
third-party developers and other users. 
In addition, labor costs, technical 
implementation needs, and the pace of 
adopting new practices are likely to vary 
across the industry. External factors, 
such as market behavior, regulatory 
changes, or shifts in the number of file 
users, may further influence the overall 
impacts. The Departments seek 
comment on these assumptions and 
uncertainties, and welcome data or 
information that could improve the 
accuracy of the estimates or help 
identify ways to address potential 
variability. 
6. Regulatory Review Cost Estimation 
To comply with these proposed rules, 
affected entities must first review and 
understand the regulatory requirements. 
While plans and issuers are ultimately 
responsible for meeting these proposed 
requirements, the Departments expect, 
as assumed elsewhere, that the burden 
of compliance would fall primarily on 
issuers and TPAs, with only the largest 
self-insured plans likely to assume this 
responsibility directly. While the 
Departments do not have specific data 
on how many large self-insured plans 
will opt to comply independently, such 
plans would likely incur similar costs 
and burdens as issuers and TPAs in 
developing compliant tools and 
reviewing these proposed rules. 
Therefore, for purposes of estimating 
regulatory review costs, the 
Departments assume that a total of 1,580 
issuers and TPAs would take on these 
responsibilities. 
Additionally, the Departments expect 
States to review these proposed rules to 
prepare for oversight and enforcement 
duties. If these proposed rules impose 
administrative costs on private entities, 
such as the time required to review and 
interpret these proposed rules, the 
Departments should estimate the costs 
associated with regulatory review. 
Given the difficulty in precisely 
determining how many entities will 
undertake such a review, the 
Departments assume that all plans (or 
TPAs on behalf of plans) and issuers, 
and States would need to review these 
proposed rules in order to comply. 
The Departments acknowledge that 
this assumption may overstate or 
understate actual costs, as not all 
entities may conduct an in-depth 
review, and some may rely on external 
counsel or consultants. Nonetheless, the 
Departments have determined that using 
the total number of plans, issuers, and 
States provides a reasonable basis for 
estimating the regulatory review burden. 
Using data from the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics’ Occupational Employment 
and Wage Statistics,
236
the Departments 
assume that issuers and TPAs would 
rely on a Computer and Information 
Systems Manager (Code 11–3021) and a 
Lawyer (Code 23–1011) to review and 
interpret these proposed rules. For 
States, a Compliance Officer (Code 13– 
1041) is assumed to perform this task. 
Assuming an average reading speed of 
200 words per minute and using BLS 
median wage data (including a 100 
percent increase to account for the cost 
of fringe benefits and other indirect 
costs), the Departments estimate that 
each issuer or TPA would require 
approximately 2.9 hours of review by a 
Computer and Information Systems 
Manager (at $164.62/hour) and 5.8 
hours by a Lawyer (at $145.34/hour). 
Based on these assumptions, the 
combined labor cost for all 1,580 issuers 
and TPAs is approximately $2,068,200.

approximately 4.6 hours (at $75.40/ 
hour) to review these proposed rules, 
resulting in a total cost of $22,111 across 
all 50 States and the District of 
Columbia. Accordingly, the total 
combined estimated cost of regulatory 
review for all plans and issuers, and 
State DOIs is approximately $2,090,311. 
E. Alternatives Considered 
1. Disclosure of Claims Volume 
The Departments considered adding a 
new content element under the In- 
network Rate File requirements at 26 
CFR 54.9815–2715A3(b)(1), 29 
CFR 2590.715–2715A3(b)(1), and 45 
CFR 147.212(b)(1) requiring disclosure 
of claims volume for each negotiated 
rate for each provider for each item and 
service as an additional or alternative 
method of providing contextual plan 
and coverage usage information. The 
Departments also considered requiring 
the Utilization File at 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(2)(ii), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(2)(ii), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(2)(ii) to disclose the number 
of times that any given provider 
submitted a claim for any particular 
item or service. Claims volume could 
inform which providers are associated 
with high-volume services and the 
respective negotiated rates as well as 
help indicate the degree to which 
negotiated rates are used by providers to 
deliver actual services to health plan 
enrollees. However, the Departments are 
concerned that this additional 
information may impose a significant 
burden for plans and issuers, who 
would need to pull claims data for each 
item and service for each provider that 
has a negotiated rate for such item and 
service and update the claims count. 
Claims data most likely resides in 
different systems from contract data and 
would need to be imported and kept up 
to date in the In-network Rate File 
according to the cadence in which the 
In-network Rate File must be updated, 
potentially making the production of In- 
network Rate Files, as well as the 
annual Utilization File, much more 
burdensome. Further, this level of 
querying is complex and potentially 
always changing based on the frequency 
of provider groups changing (which 
providers are included in the TIN/NPI 
combination) and claims activity 
associated with such providers for such 
items and services, making the burden 
not only significant but ongoing. Lastly, 
current In-network Rate Files contain 
contract data which is prospective in 
nature and claims data is retrospective. 
The mixing of types of data within a file 
may introduce potential data confusion. 
Therefore, the Departments are not 
proposing to require disclosure of 
claims-related information in the In- 
network Rate File or the Utilization File. 
The Departments seek comment on the 
relative benefits and burdens interested 
parties might anticipate with requiring 
claims-related information. 
2. Excluded Information 
As an alternative to the proposal to 
require plans and issuers to exclude 
from each In-network Rate File a 
provider and their negotiated rate 
(provider-rate combination) for an item 
or service, if it is unlikely that such 
provider would be reimbursed for the 
item or service given that provider’s 
area of specialty according to the plan’s 
or issuer’s internal provider taxonomy 
used during the claims adjudication 
process, the Departments considered 
two alternative approaches. The first 
approach involved running each 
combination of provider and service as 
a mock claim and only including in the 
In-network Rate File those claims that 
passed validation edits for 
appropriateness of that provider to 
perform the service. This is different 
from the proposed process described in 
section III.C.5. of this preamble because 
it would require plans and issuers to 
process each potential provider-rate 
combination through its claims 
adjudication, rather than relying on its 
internal mapping of billing codes to 
exclude providers. This method 
establishes a clear standard and 
provides meaningful information, 
resulting in smaller In-network Rate 
Files that are far more accessible and 
manageable. However, there are 
significant drawbacks to this approach. 
Plans and issuers would face a high 
initial and ongoing administrative and 
financial burden, as they would need to 
run every provider through the claims 
adjudication system for every item or 
service with a negotiated rate, repeating 
this process quarterly. This method 
imposes the greatest engineering burden 
among the options considered, as it may 
require setting up and maintaining 
parallel adjudication systems 
specifically for this task, separate from 
production adjudication systems. The 
Departments considered the 
administrative burden associated with 
this approach to be a significant 
deterrent to proposing this approach as 
a viable option. 
Second, the Departments explored the 
idea of requiring plans and issuers to 
create In-network Rate Files with 
negotiated rates based solely on historic 
claims data, identifying providers who 
have submitted claims for specific items 
or services. This approach has several 
advantages. It would establish a clear 
standard, provide meaningful 
information, and ensure that negotiated 
rates are disclosed only for providers 
who have actually submitted claims for 
those items and services over the course 
of a particular period of time. However, 
the proposal also presented significant 
drawbacks. First, this approach would 
lack a mechanism to monitor over- 
filtering by plans and issuers, 
potentially excluding relevant 
providers. Also, mixing prospective and 
retrospective data within the In-network 
Rate File could confuse users about 
which services are available under 
current contracts versus historical 
activity. Finally, the approach might 
require exceptions for new providers 
who have not yet submitted claims, 
making it difficult for users to 
distinguish between active providers 
and those who are unlikely to offer 
specific services. As a result, the 
Departments determined this approach 
was overly complex as compared with 
the proposed approach of utilizing the 
taxonomy data discussed. 
3. Data Retention 
The Departments received feedback 
from interested parties recommending 
that plans and issuers be required to 
retain the Transparency in Coverage 
data required pursuant to 26 CFR 
54.9815–2715A3(b), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b), 45 CFR 147.212(b) on a 
public website for 7 years. They argue 
their recommendation on the fact that, 
because plans and issuers are currently 
only required to post their machine- 
readable files monthly, most plans and 
issuers replace the files on their website 
each month, making the prior month’s 
files unavailable, and consequently 
making it difficult for file consumers 
like researchers and academics to 
analyze pricing trends over time, verify 
historical rates, or assess the evolution 
of provider-plan relationships. 
The Departments considered data 
retention standards of 7 years, as well as 
shorter durations, but are not proposing 
any data retention requirements at this 
time due to the significant cost and 
burden the Departments have 
determined it would incur on plans and 
issuers. Specifically, storing, 
maintaining, and making 7 years of 
machine-readable files publicly 
available would be costly, and the 
benefits, such as enabling longitudinal 
analysis of contractual data and 
historical price benchmarking, are 
relatively marginal especially if other 
proposals in these proposed rules are 
finalized. In particular, the 
recommendation would necessitate

capacity—moving beyond transient 
monthly files to a vast archive capable 
of accommodating potential petabytes of 
historical records. Concurrently, 
significant network bandwidth 
allocations would be required to handle 
the consistent monthly influx of new 
data, as well as the eventual high- 
volume demands of researchers or other 
entities accessing and downloading 
years’ worth of historical files. 
Furthermore, the ongoing maintenance 
and organization of the datasets would 
require ensuring data integrity over 
time, implementing efficient indexing 
and cataloging of systems for easy 
discoverability. Without careful 
engineering planning and dedicated 
resources, the archived files risk 
becoming digital landfills, undermining 
the transparency they are intended to 
provide. 
The Departments’ proposed change 
from a requirement to post updated In- 
network Rate and Allowed Amount 
Files every month to quarterly in 
redesignated 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(4)(i), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(4)(i), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(4)(i) and described in section 
III.C.10. of this preamble would reduce 
the number of files required to be 
retained by users for future reference 
and thus the associated costs of doing 
so. Similarly, a quarterly cadence 
should ease the difficulty some users 
have when downloading and collecting 
the file data monthly, thus expanding 
access to more users without losing any 
data. The Departments also expect that 
the proposed requirement for plans and 
issuers to produce a quarterly Change- 
log File in new 26 CFR 54.9815– 
2715A3(b)(2)(i), 29 CFR 2590.715– 
2715A3(b)(2)(i), and 45 CFR 
147.212(b)(2)(i) and described in section 
III.C.7.a. of this preamble may help 
users more easily catalog and assess 
data changes over time, limiting the 
need to access all the data in prior files. 
The Departments, however, seek 
comment on the relative burdens and 
benefits of requiring files to be publicly 
posted for a specific period of time. The 
Departments are particularly interested 
in whether interested parties believe 
that public retention of prior files would 
continue to be valuable if combined 
with the other changes in these 
proposed rules. The Departments are 
also interested in views from interested 
parties on what would be a sufficient 
amount of retention time that would 
still provide value for file users without 
imposing an undue burden on plans and 
issuers. 
4. Deemed Compliance With PHS Act 
Section 2799A–4, ERISA Section 719, 
and Code Section 9819 
The Departments indicated in FAQs 
Part 49 on August 20, 2021
237
that, 
because the price comparison methods 
required by the No Surprises Act 
(codified in Code section 9819, ERISA 
section 719, and PHS Act section 
2799A–4) are largely duplicative of the 
self-service tool described in the 2020 
final rules, the Departments intended to 
propose rulemaking and seek public 
comment regarding whether compliance 
with the self-service tool requirements 
of the 2020 final rules satisfies the 
analogous requirements set forth in 
Code section 9819, ERISA section 719, 
and PHS Act section 2799A–4. The 
Departments recognized that plans and 
issuers had already been working to 
implement the self-service tool 
requirement of the 2020 final rules. 
The Departments considered 
requiring plans to develop a separate 
cost comparison tool to fulfill the 
requirements of the No Surprises Act, 
however, such a proposal would likely 
impose significant costs on plans and 
issuers for having to build an entirely 
new technical infrastructure, with little 
additional benefits for participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees, given that 
the provisions of the No Surprises Act 
largely duplicate the requirements of the 
Transparency in Coverage rules. 
Additionally, there would be great 
potential for public confusion, as 
participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees 
would be unsure of which tool use, 
whether they had different purposes, 
and the potential for search results to be 
different. The Departments have 
received feedback from plans and 
issuers that their participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees expressed 
similar concerns of confusion as the 
plan and issuer transitioned from a 
legacy self-service tool to a tool that 
satisfied the requirements of the 2020 
final rules. For these reasons, the 
Departments are not proposing to 
require an additional self-service tool. 
F. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(RFA)
238
requires agencies to prepare an 
initial regulatory flexibility analysis to 
describe the impact of a proposed rule 
on small entities, unless the head of the 
agency can certify that the rule will not 
have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities. 
The Departments have determined that 
the costs calculated in these proposed 
rules do not rise to the level of 
significance under the RFA. The 
Departments have prepared the 
following justification for this 
determination. 
1. Proposed Rules 
These proposed amendments aim to 
improve the accessibility, 
standardization, and utility of pricing 
data disclosures by refining certain 
requirements and aligning regulatory 
text with the No Surprises Act and 
Executive Order 14221. Key changes 
include clarifying the balance billing 
disclaimer to reflect Federal protections, 
requiring that cost-sharing information 
to also be made available by phone, and 
enhancing the format and usability of 
machine-readable files by reducing 
duplication and file size. 
2. Affected Entities 
The RFA generally defines a ‘‘small 
entity’’ as (1) a proprietary firm meeting 
the size standards of the Small Business 
Administration (SBA), (2) a not-for- 
profit organization that is not dominant 
in its field, or (3) a small government 
jurisdiction with a population of less 
than 50,000. States and individuals are 
not included in the definition of ‘‘small 
entity.’’ The Departments use a change 
in revenues of more than 3 to 5 percent 
as its measure of significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. For purposes of the RFA, small 
entities include small businesses, 
nonprofit organizations, and small 
governmental jurisdiction. 
a. Group Health Plans 
As discussed in section VI.C.1. of this 
preamble, these proposed rules would 
affect ERISA-covered group health plans 
and non-Federal governmental group 
health plans. The Department estimates 
that there are approximately 2,500,000 
ERISA-covered group health plans with 
less than 100 employees, of which 
1,400,000 are fully funded.
239
For 
purposes of the RFA, the Department of 
Labor continues to consider a small 
entity to be an employee benefit plan

Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy 
in making this determination, as required by 5 
U.S.C. 603(c) and 13 CFR 121.903(c) in a memo 
dated June 4, 2020. 
241
Based on data from the 2022 Census of 
Governments, there are 90,887 State and local 
entities. The Departments assume there is one plan 
per entity on average. Therefore, the Departments 
estimate that there are 90,887 non-Federal 
governmental plans. U.S. Census Bureau, 2022

The Departments have determined that most 
TPAs are or are affiliated with issuers. 
254
The per-entity costs are estimated at $578,298 
for the first year and $43,165 on an ongoing annual 
basis. These figures are derived by dividing the total 
estimated first-year cost of $913,710,577 and the 
total estimated ongoing annual cost of $68,201,320 
by the total number of affected entities (1,375 
issuers + 205 TPAs = 1,580). 
with fewer than 100 participants.
240
 
Further, while some large employers 
may have small plans, in general, most 
small plans are maintained by small 
employers. Thus, the Departments have 
determined that assessing the impact of 
these proposed rules on small plans is 
an appropriate substitute for evaluating 
the effect on small entities. The 
definition of small entity considered 
appropriate for this purpose differs, 
however, from a definition of small 
business that is based on size standards 
issued by the SBA (13 CFR 121.201) 
pursuant to the Small Business Act (15 
U.S.C. 631, et seq.). Therefore, the 
Departments invite comments on the 
appropriateness of the size standard 
used in evaluating the impact of these 
proposed rules on small entities. 
The Department also estimates there 
are approximately 90,900 non-Federal 
governmental group health plans.
241
Of 
these plans, approximately 35.7 
percent
242
(or 32,400) are self- 
insured,
243
and 64.3 percent (or 58,400) 
are fully insured.
244
Furthermore, 
approximately 93.4 percent of group 
health plans have less than 100 
employees.
245
Therefore, the 
Department estimates there are 
approximately 84,900 non-Federal 
governmental health plans with less 
than 100 employees, of which 30,300 
are self-insured
246
and 54,600 are fully 
funded.
247
 
b. Participants and Enrollees 
The Departments estimate that there 
are 35.6 million participants in ERISA- 
covered group health plans with also 
100 employees, of which 5.6 million are 
in self-insured plans and 30.1 million 
are in fully funded plans.
248
There are 
also approximately 2.2 million 
participants in non-Federal 
governmental group health plans with 
less than 100 employees, of which one 
million are in self-insured plans and 1.2 
million are in fully insured plans.
249
 
c. Issuers and TPAs 
For purposes of the RFA, the 
Departments have determined that 
health insurance companies are 
generally classified under the North 
American Industry Classification 
System (NAICS) code 524114 (Direct 
Health and Medical Insurance Carriers). 
According to SBA size standards,
250
 
entities with average annual receipts of 
$47 million or less are considered small 
entities within this classification. 
Alternatively, some may fall under 
NAICS code 621491 (HMO Medical 
Centers), which has a size standard of 
$44.5 million or less.
251
 
Based on data from Medical Loss 
Ratio (MLR) annual report submissions 
for the 2023 reporting year, 
approximately 84 out of 479 (18 
percent) issuers of health insurance 
coverage nationwide had total premium 
revenues of $47 million or less.
252
The 
Departments also estimate, based on 
MLR data, that over 80 percent of these 
small companies belong to larger 
holding groups, and many, if not all, of 
these small companies, are likely to 
have non-health lines of business that 
would result in their revenues 
exceeding $47 million. The Departments 
have determined that the same 
assumptions also apply to TPAs that 
would be affected by these proposed 
rules.
253
However, it should be noted 
that at least 76 percent of these small 
companies belong to larger holding 
groups that may not be small, and many, 
if not all, of these companies are likely 
to have non-health lines of business that 
would result in their revenues 
exceeding $47 million. 
3. Cost of These Proposed Rules 
Using a threshold approach, if the 
total costs of these proposed rules were 
spread evenly across all 1,375 issuers 
and 205 TPAs, the high-end per-entity 
costs would be approximately $578,298 
in one-time first-year costs and $43,165 
in ongoing annual costs, which would 
also be incurred in the first year.
254
 
Although the Departments are not able 
to apply the 3 to 5 percent change in 
revenues standard as a measure of 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities due 
to limited data, as discussed in section 
VI.F.3. of this preamble, it is notable 
that over 80 percent of issuers and at 
least 76 percent of TPAs classified as 
small businesses are affiliated with 
larger holding groups that may not 
themselves qualify as small. Based on 
this information, the Departments 
anticipate that the costs associated with 
these proposed rules do not rise to the 
level of significance under the RFA. 
Therefore, the Departments conclude 
that an initial regulatory flexibility 
analysis is not required for such firms. 
The Departments seek comment on the 
assumptions and methodology 
underlying this analysis, including 
whether alternative data or approaches 
could better assess the impact on small 
plans and issuers, and on potential ways 
to reduce burden while meeting the 
objectives of these proposed rules. 
Although ERISA-covered plans are 
often small entities, the Departments 
have determined that these plans would 
rely on the larger health insurance 
issuers and TPAs to comply with these 
proposed rules. Nevertheless, these 
plans may still experience increased

costs due to the requirements, as the 
costs associated with implementation 
are likely to be passed on to them. 
However, the Departments are not of the 
view that the additional costs rise to the 
level of a significant economic impact. 
In addition, although the requirements 
of this proposal do not directly apply to 
providers, providers may experience a 
loss in revenue as a result of the 
demands of price-sensitive consumers 
and plans, as well as a potential 
unwillingness among smaller issuers to 
continue paying higher rates than those 
of larger issuers for the same items and 
services. 
The Departments acknowledge that it 
may be likely that a number of small 
entities might enter into contracts with 
other entities in order to meet the 
requirements in these proposed rules, 
perhaps allowing for the development of 
economies of scale. However, due to 
limited information about how small 
entities may choose to meet these 
requirements and the potential costs 
associated with such contractual 
arrangements, the Departments seek 
comment on ways that these proposed 
rules could impose additional costs and 
burdens on small entities and how 
many such entities would likely enter 
into contracts to meet these proposed 
requirements. 
Finally, section 1102(b) of the Social 
Security Act (SSA) (42 U.S.C. 1302) 
requires agencies to prepare a regulatory 
impact analysis if a rule is expected to 
have a significant impact on the 
operations of a substantial number of 
small rural hospitals. This analysis must 
align with the provisions of section 603 
of the RFA. For purposes of section 
1102(b) of the SSA, the Departments 
define a small rural hospital as a 
hospital that is located outside of a 
metropolitan statistical area with fewer 
than 100 beds. While these proposed 
rules are not anticipated to directly 
regulate small rural hospitals, the 
Departments acknowledge that the 
transparency requirement may have 
indirect effects on these facilities 
through potential changes in negotiated 
rates and patient cost-sharing, behaviors 
that could impact hospital revenues, 
particularly given that rural providers 
typically operate with thinner profit 
margins than their urban counterparts. 
However, the Departments recognize 
that rural hospitals may also face lower 
levels of competition and any indirect 
effects that result from these proposed 
rules may have a lower impact, in some 
areas. Therefore, the Departments have 
determined that while there may be 
indirect effects, these do not rise to the 
level of a significant impact on the 
operations of a substantial number of 
small rural hospitals. 
4. Duplicate, Overlapping, or Relevant 
Federal Rules 
There are no duplicate, overlapping, 
or relevant Federal rules. 
G. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
(UMRA) 
Section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) 
requires agencies to assess anticipated 
costs and benefits before issuing any 
rule that may result in expenditures of 
$100 million or more in any one year (in 
1995 dollars), adjusted annually for 
inflation. For 2025, this threshold is 
approximately $187 million. These 
proposed rules include disclosure 
requirements that may impact private 
sector entities, such as health insurance 
issuers offering coverage in the 
individual and group health insurance 
markets and TPAs administering group 
health plans. In addition, States, local, 
or Tribal governments may incur costs 
related to enforcement of certain 
provisions. The Departments expect the 
total burden on States, local, or Tribal 
governments and the private sector to 
exceed the UMRA threshold. The 
regulatory impact analysis proceeding 
this section of the preamble constitutes 
the assessment of anticipated costs and 
benefits required by UMRA. 
H. Federalism 
Executive Order 13132 establishes 
certain requirements that an agency 
must meet when it issues a proposed 
rule that imposes substantial direct 
costs on State and local governments, 
preempts State law, or otherwise has 
federalism implications. Federal 
agencies issuing regulations that have 
federalism implications must consult 
with States and local officials and 
describe the extent of their consultation 
and the nature of the concerns of States 
and local officials in the preamble to the 
regulation. 
In the Departments’ view, these 
proposed rules may have federalism 
implications, because it would have 
direct effects on the States, the 
relationship between the Federal 
Government and States, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among various levels of 
government relating to the disclosure of 
health insurance coverage information 
to consumers. 
Under these proposed rules, all group 
health plans and health insurance 
issuers, including self-insured, non- 
Federal governmental group health 
plans as defined in section 2791 of the 
PHS Act, would be required to enhance 
the accessibility and transparency of 
cost-sharing and pricing information for 
a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or 
an authorized representative on behalf 
of such individual). Specifically, plans 
and issuers would need to update 
disclaimers to reflect Federal balance 
billing protections, make cost-sharing 
estimates available by phone, and 
clarify how to meet the requirements for 
price comparison tools. These proposed 
rules would also require improvements 
to the format and accessibility of 
machine-readable files, expansion of 
required data elements, and adjustments 
to posting frequency and structure to 
ensure pricing data is more usable and 
understandable for consumers. Federal 
standards developed under section 
2715A of the PHS Act preempt any 
related States’ standards that require 
pricing information to be disclosed to 
the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee, 
or otherwise publicly disclosed, to the 
extent the State disclosure requirements 
would provide less information to the 
consumer or the public than what is 
required under these proposed rules. 
The Departments have determined 
that these proposed rules may have 
federalism implications based on the 
required disclosure of pricing 
information, as they are aware of at least 
25 States that have passed some form of 
price transparency legislation, such as 
all-payer claims databases, consumer- 
facing price comparison tools, and the 
right to shop programs, with varying 
requirements regarding the scope and 
level of disclosure.
255
While some States 
provide prices for individual services, 
others report aggregated costs across 
providers or over time to reflect the cost 
of an episode of care. The methods of 
sharing this information also vary. For 
instance, California requires uninsured 
patients to receive price estimates upon 
request, whereas other States use 
websites or software applications to 
enable consumers to compare prices 
across providers. Only seven States have 
published pricing information of issuers 
on consumer-facing public websites.
256
 
Therefore, these proposed rules may 
require plans and issuers to disclose 
more detailed pricing information than 
some State laws currently mandate. 
In general, through section 514, 
ERISA supersedes State laws to the

U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Department of 
Health & Human Services & U.S. Department of the 
Treasury, FAQs about Affordable Care Act Implementation Part 54 (July 28, 2022), https://

and https://www.cms.gov/files/document/faqs-part- 54.pdf. 
extent that they relate to any covered 
employee benefit plan but preserves 
State laws that regulate insurance, 
banking, or securities. Furthermore, the 
preemption provisions of section 731 of 
ERISA and section 2724 of the PHS Act 
(implemented in 29 CFR 2590.731(a) 
and 45 CFR 146.143(a)) apply so that the 
provisions of Part 7 of ERISA and 
chapter XXVII of the PHS Act (including 
the amendments made by the Affordable 
Care Act) are not to be ‘‘construed to 
supersede any provision of State law 
which establishes, implements, or 
continues in effect any standard or 
requirement solely relating to issuers in 
connection with group health insurance 
coverage except to the extent that such 
standard or requirement prevents the 
application of a ‘requirement’ of a 
Federal standard.’’ The conference 
report accompanying HIPAA indicates 
that this preemption is intended to be 
the ‘‘narrowest’’ preemption of State 
laws.
257
States may therefore continue 
to apply State law requirements to 
issuers so long as such requirements do 
not prevent the application of the 
Affordable Care Act requirements that 
are the subject of this rulemaking. 
Accordingly, States have significant 
latitude to impose requirements on 
issuers that are more restrictive than the 
Federal law. 
In compliance with the requirement 
of Executive Order 13132, which 
requires agencies to examine closely any 
policies that may have federalism 
implications or limit the policy making 
discretion of the States, the Departments 
have engaged in efforts to consult with 
and work cooperatively with affected 
States. These efforts have included 
participation in conference calls and 
events hosted by the NAIC, as well as 
direct engagement with State insurance 
officials. The Departments intend to act 
in a similar fashion in enforcing the 
Affordable Care Act, including the 
provisions of section 2715A of the PHS 
Act. While drafting these proposed 
rules, the Departments attempted to 
balance the States’ interests in 
regulating issuers with the goal of 
enhancing price transparency 
nationwide. By doing so, the 
Departments have determined that they 
have complied with the requirements of 
Executive Order 13132. 
The Departments request comment on 
any potential effects these proposed 
rules may have on States. The 
Departments also request comment 
regarding any duplicative burdens that 
may exist between State and Federal 
requirements and ways such duplicative 
burdens can be addressed, if applicable. 
In accordance with the requirements 
set forth in section 8(a) of Executive 
Order 13132, and by the signatures 
affixed to these proposed rules, the 
Departments certify that the Department 
of the Treasury, Employee Benefits 
Security Administration, and the CMS 
have complied with the requirements of 
Executive Order 13132 for the attached 
proposed rules in a meaningful and 
timely manner. 
I. Executive Order 14192, ‘‘Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation’’ 
Executive Order 14192, titled 
‘‘Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation,’’ was issued on January 
31, 2025. Section 3(a) of Executive 
Order 14192 requires an agency, unless 
prohibited by law, to identify at least 
ten existing regulations to be repealed 
when the agency issues a new 
regulation. In furtherance of this 
requirement, section 3(c) of Executive 
Order 14192 requires that the new 
incremental costs associated with new 
regulations shall, to the extent permitted 
by law, be offset by the elimination of 
existing costs associated with prior 
regulations. A significant regulatory 
action (as defined in section 3(f) of 
Executive Order 12866) that would 
impose total costs greater than zero is 
considered an Executive Order 14192 
regulatory action. This proposed rule, if 
finalized as proposed, is, therefore, 
expected to be an Executive Order 
14192 regulatory action. Details on the 
estimated costs appear in the preceding 
analysis.

coverage—required disclosures to 
participants and beneficiaries. 
* * * * * 
(b) * * * 
(1) * * * 
(i) * * * 
(A) If the request for cost-sharing 
information relates to items and services 
that are provided within a bundled 
payment arrangement, and the bundled 
payment arrangement includes items or 
services that have a separate cost- 
sharing liability, the group health plan 
or health insurance issuer must provide 
estimates of the cost-sharing liability for 
the requested covered item or service, as 
well as an estimate of the cost-sharing 
liability for each of the items and 
services in the bundled payment 
arrangement that have separate cost- 
sharing liabilities. While plans and 
issuers are not required to provide 
estimates of cost-sharing liability for a 
bundled payment arrangement where 
the cost-sharing is imposed separately 
for each item and service included in 
the bundled payment arrangement, 
nothing prohibits plans or issuers from 
providing estimates for multiple items 
and services in situations where such 
estimates could be relevant to 
participants or beneficiaries, as long as 
the plan or issuer also discloses 
information about the relevant items or 
services individually, as required in 
paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section. 
(B) For requested items and services 
that are recommended preventive 
services under section 2713 of the 
Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), if 
the group health plan or health 
insurance issuer cannot determine 
whether the request is for preventive or 
non-preventive purposes, the plan or 
issuer must display the cost-sharing 
liability that applies for non-preventive 
purposes. As an alternative, a plan or 
issuer may allow a participant or 
beneficiary to request cost-sharing 
information for the specific preventive 
or non-preventive item or service by 
including terms such as ‘‘preventive,’’ 
‘‘non-preventive,’’ or ‘‘diagnostic’’ as a 
means to request the most accurate cost- 
sharing information. 
* * * * * 
(vii) * * * 
(A) A statement that the cost-sharing 
information provided pursuant to this 
paragraph (b)(1) does not account for 
potential additional amounts in 
situations where applicable State or 
Federal law allow out-of-network 
providers to bill participants or 
beneficiaries for the difference between 
a provider’s billed charges and the sum 
of the amount collected from the group 
health plan or health insurance issuer 
and from the participants or 
beneficiaries in the form of a 
copayment, coinsurance, or deductible 
amount (the difference referred to as 
balance billing). This statement is not 
required if the State in which the item 
or service was furnished prohibits all 
out-of-network providers from balance 
billing for all items and services payable 
by the plan or issuer. 
* * * * * 
(2) * * * 
(ii) Paper method. Information provided under this paragraph (b) must 
be made available in plain language, 
without a fee, in paper form at the 
request of the participant or beneficiary. 
In responding to such a request, the 
group health plan or health insurance 
issuer may limit the number of 
providers with respect to which cost- 
sharing information for covered items 
and services is provided to no fewer 
than 20 providers per request. The plan 
or issuer is required to: 
* * * * * 
(iii) Phone method. Information provided under this paragraph (b) must 
be made available at the request of the 
participant or beneficiary via a 
telephone number through which a 
consumer may seek customer assistance 
that Code section 9816(e) requires be 
indicated on any physical or electronic 
plan or insurance identification card 
issued to a participant, beneficiary, or 
enrollee. Such information must be 
accurate at the time of the request and 
must be provided at the time of the 
request. In responding to such a request, 
the group health plan or health 
insurance issuer may limit the number 
of providers with respect to which cost- 
sharing information for covered items 
and services is provided to no fewer 
than 20 providers per day. The plan or 
issuer is required to: 
(A) Disclose the applicable provider- 
per-day limit; and 
(B) Provide the cost-sharing 
information, in accordance with the 
requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) 
through (C) of this section. 
(iv) Alternative method. In circumstances where participants and 
beneficiaries request disclosure other 
than by the internet-based self-service 
tool, paper, or phone (for example, by 
email) group health plans and health 
insurance issuers may provide the 
disclosure through alternative means 
and satisfy the requirements of this 
section, provided the participant or 
beneficiary agrees that such disclosure 
through such means is sufficient to 
satisfy the request and the plan or issuer 
meets the timing requirements 
established under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) 
of this section for paper method 
disclosure. 
(3) * * * 
(i) Special rule for insured group health plans. To the extent coverage 
under a group health plan consists of 
group health insurance coverage, the 
plan satisfies the requirements of this 
paragraph (b) if the plan requires the 
health insurance issuer offering the 
coverage to provide the information 
required by this paragraph (b) in 
compliance with this section pursuant 
to a written agreement. Accordingly, if 
an issuer and a plan sponsor enter into 
a written agreement under which the 
issuer agrees to provide the information 
required under this paragraph (b) in 
compliance with this section, and the 
issuer fails to do so, then the issuer, but 
not the plan, violates the transparency 
disclosure requirements of this 
paragraph (b). 
(ii) Other contractual arrangements. A group health plan or health insurance 
issuer may satisfy the requirements 
under this paragraph (b) by entering into 
a written agreement under which 
another party (such as a pharmacy 
benefit manager or other third-party) 
provides the information required by 
this paragraph (b) in compliance with 
this section. Notwithstanding the 
preceding sentence, if a plan or issuer 
chooses to enter into such an agreement 
and the party with which it contracts 
fails to provide the information in 
compliance with this paragraph (b), the 
plan or issuer violates the transparency 
disclosure requirements of this 
paragraph (b).

§ 54.9815–2715A3 Transparency in 
coverage—requirements for public 
disclosure. 
* * * * * 
(b) Requirements for public disclosure of in-network provider rates for covered 
items and services, out-of-network 
allowed amounts and billed charges for 
covered items and services, negotiated 
rates and historical net prices for 
covered prescription drugs, and 
contextual information. A group health 
plan or health insurance issuer must 
make available on an internet website 
the information required under 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section 
in machine-readable files, in accordance 
with the method and format 
requirements described in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, and that are 
updated as required under paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section. 
(1) * * * 
(i) An in-network rate machine- 
readable file for each provider network 
maintained or contracted by a group 
health plan or health insurance issuer 
that includes the required information 
under this paragraph (b)(1)(i) for all 
covered items and services under each 
coverage option offered by the plan or 
issuer that uses such provider network, 
except for prescription drugs that are 
subject to a fee-for-service 
reimbursement arrangement, which 
must be reported in the prescription 
drug machine-readable file pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. Each 
in-network rate machine-readable file 
must include: 
(A) The common provider network 
name; 
(B) For each coverage option offered 
by a group health plan or health 
insurance issuer that uses such provider 
network, the name; the Health Insurance 
Oversight System (HIOS) identifier, or, 
if no HIOS identifier is available, the 
Employer Identification Number (EIN); 
and the product type (for example, 
Health Maintenance Organization, 
Preferred Provider Organization); 
(C) A billing code, which in the case 
of prescription drugs must be an NDC, 
and a plain language description for 
each billing code for each covered item 
or service included in the machine- 
readable file; 
(D) For each covered item or service 
included in the machine-readable file, 
all applicable rates, which may include 
one or more of the following: Negotiated 
rates, underlying fee schedule rates, or 
derived amounts. If a group health plan 
or health insurance issuer does not use 
negotiated rates for provider 
reimbursement, then the plan or issuer 
should disclose derived amounts to the 
extent these amounts are already 
calculated in the normal course of 
business. If the plan or issuer uses 
underlying fee schedule rates for 
calculating cost sharing, then the plan 
or issuer should include the underlying 
fee schedule rates in addition to the 
negotiated rate or derived amount. 
Applicable rates, including for both 
individual items and services and items 
and services in a bundled payment 
arrangement, must be: 
(1) Reflected as dollar amounts, with 
respect to each covered item or service 
that is furnished by an in-network 
provider. If the negotiated rate is subject 
to change based upon participant or 
beneficiary-specific characteristics, 
these dollar amounts should be reflected 
as the base negotiated rate applicable to 
the item or service prior to adjustments 
for participant or beneficiary-specific 
characteristics. For contractual 
arrangements under which a group 
health plan or health insurance issuer 
agrees to pay an in-network provider a 
percentage of billed charges and is not 
able to assign a dollar amount to an item 
or service prior to a bill being generated, 
plans and issuers must report a 
percentage number, in lieu of a dollar 
amount, in a form and manner as 
specified in guidance issued by the 
Department of the Treasury, the 
Department of Labor, and the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
(2) Associated with the National 
Provider Identifier (NPI), Tax 
Identification Number (TIN), and Place 
of Service Code for each in-network 
provider, except those specified in 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(F) of this section; 
(3) Associated with the last date of the 
contract term or expiration date for each 
provider-specific applicable rate that 
applies to each covered item or service; 
and 
(4) Indicated with a notation where a 
reimbursement arrangement other than 
a standard fee-for-service model (such 
as capitation or a bundled payment 
arrangement) applies. 
(E) Current numerical enrollment 
totals, as of the date the file is posted, 
for each coverage option offered by a 
group health plan or health insurance 
issuer that uses such provider network. 
Such numerical enrollment totals must 
include the number of participants and 
beneficiaries (including all dependents) 
in the coverage option offered by a plan 
or issuer. 
(F) A group health plan or health 
insurance issuer must exclude from 
each file under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section a provider and their negotiated 
rate (provider-rate combination) for an 
item or service if the plan or issuer 
determines it is unlikely that the 
provider would be reimbursed for the 
item or service given that provider’s 
area of specialty according to the plan’s 
or issuer’s internal provider taxonomy

with respect to each covered item or 
service under any coverage option 
offered by a group health plan or health

particular item or service when 
compliance with this paragraph

issuer to report payment of out-of- 
network allowed amounts in connection 
with fewer than 11 different claims for 
payment of that item or service in a 
single health insurance market). 
Consistent with paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, nothing in this paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii)(C) requires the disclosure of 
information that would violate any 
applicable health information privacy 
law. Each unique out-of-network 
allowed amount must be:

respect to each covered item or service 
that is furnished by an out-of-network 
provider; and 
(2) Associated with the NPI, TIN, and 
Place of Service Code for each out-of- 
network provider. 
* * * * * 
(2) Required contextual files. A group health plan or health insurance issuer 
must make available in a machine- 
readable format: 
(i) A change-log file, for each in- 
network rate machine-readable file 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section, that identifies any changes 
made to the required information 
described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section since the immediately preceding 
published in-network rate machine- 
readable file. 
(ii) A utilization file, for each in- 
network rate machine-readable file 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section, that includes, for the 12-month 
period that ends 6 months prior to the 
publication date of each utilization file: 
(A) Items and services covered under 
the plans or policies included in the 
files prepared as specified in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section for which a claim 
has been submitted and reimbursed, in 
whole or in part; and 
(B) Each in-network provider 
identified by the NPI, TIN, and Place of 
Service Code who was reimbursed, in 
whole or in part, for a claim for each 
covered item or service included as 
specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of 
this section. 
(iii) A taxonomy file, for each in- 
network rate machine-readable file 
prepared as specified in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section, which includes 
the group health plan’s or health 
insurance issuer’s internal provider 
taxonomy that matches items and 
services (represented by a billing code) 
with provider specialties (represented 
by specialty codes which are derived 
from the Health Care Provider 
Taxonomy code set established by the 
National Uniform Claim Committee 
(NUCC)) to determine if the plan or 
issuer should deny reimbursement for 
an item or service because it was not 
furnished by a provider in an 
appropriate specialty.. Plans and issuers 
must use their internal provider 
taxonomy to determine whether to 
exclude certain provider-rate 
combinations from the in-network rate 
machine-readable file as specified in 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(F) of this section. 
(iv) A plain text file in a .txt format 
in the root folder (that is, the top-level 
directory on an electronic file system) of 
a group health plan’s or health 
insurance issuer’s website that includes: 
(A) The source page URL for the 
internet website that hosts the machine- 
readable files required under paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (2) of this section; 
(B) A direct link to the URL for the 
machine-readable files required under 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section; 
and 
(C) Point-of-contact information, 
including an up-to-date name, title, and 
email address for an individual who can 
address inquiries and issues related to 
the machine-readable files required 
under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this 
section. This contact information must 
be prominently displayed on the same 
website where the machine-readable 
files are made available and be kept 
updated per the requirements in 
paragraph (b)(4)(vi) of this section. 
(3) Required method and format for disclosing information to the public. (i) 
The machine-readable files described in 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section 
must be available in a form and manner 
as specified in guidance issued by the 
Department of the Treasury, the 
Department of Labor, and the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
(ii) The machine-readable files must 
be publicly available and accessible to 
any person, automated scripts, or web 
crawlers free of charge and without 
conditions, such as establishment of a 
user account, password, submission of 
personally identifiable information or 
other credentials, or blocking server 
configurations or firewalls to access the 
file. 
(iii) The source page URL for the 
internet website that hosts the machine- 
readable files required under paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (2) of this section must be 
included as a link in the footer on the 
home page of the group health plan’s or 
health insurance issuer’s website, as 
well as any page of the website that 
features a footer, that is labeled ‘‘Price 
Transparency’’ or ‘‘Transparency in 
Coverage’’ and links directly to the 
publicly available web page that hosts 
the link to the machine-readable files. 
(iv) The group health plan or health 
insurance issuer may satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of 
this section by entering into a written 
agreement under which another party 
(such as a third-party administrator) 
posts the machine-readable files on its 
public website on behalf of the plan or 
issuer, including if the plan or issuer 
does not have a website. However, if the 
files are posted on a service provider’s 
website, and the plan or issuer 
maintains a public website but chooses 
not to host the files separately on its 
own public website, it must provide a 
link on its own public website to the 
location where the files are made 
publicly available. 
(4) Timing. A group health plan or health insurance issuer must update the 
machine-readable files in accordance 
with the following timeframes and 
clearly indicate the date that the files 
were most recently updated: 
(i) The in-network rate and out-of- 
network allowed amount machine- 
readable files required by paragraphs 
(b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section must be 
updated and posted quarterly beginning 
on the first day of the calendar-year 
quarter following the applicability date 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section; 
(ii) The prescription drug machine- 
readable file required by paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section must be 
updated monthly; 
(iii) The change-log machine-readable 
file required by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
this section must be updated and posted 
quarterly beginning on the first day of 
the calendar-year quarter following the 
date on which the first in-network rate 
machine-readable file is required to be 
posted under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this 
section in accordance with the 
applicability date of the amendments to 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section as 
specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section. If there are no changes to the in- 
network rate machine-readable file 
described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section since the last such file was

file must still be updated and posted 
quarterly indicating there are no 
changes; 
(iv) The utilization machine-readable 
file required under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) 
of this section must be updated and 
posted annually beginning on the first 
day of the calendar-year quarter 
following the applicability date under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section; 
(v) The taxonomy machine-readable 
file required under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) 
of this section must be updated and 
posted quarterly beginning on the first 
day of the calendar-year quarter 
following the applicability date under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If there 
are no changes to the taxonomy that 
affect the information required in the 
machine-readable file required under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section in a 
subsequent quarter, the posted 
taxonomy file is not required to updated 
that quarter; and 
(vi) The text file required by 
paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section must 
be posted beginning on the first day of 
the calendar-year quarter following the 
applicability date under paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section and subsequently 
updated and posted as soon as 
practicable but no later than 7 calendar 
days following a change in any of the 
information required under paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv) of this section. 
(5) Special rules to prevent unnecessary duplication—(i) Special rule for insured group health plans. To 
the extent coverage under a group 
health plan consists of group health 
insurance coverage, the plan satisfies 
the requirements of this paragraph (b) if 
the plan requires the health insurance 
issuer offering the coverage to provide 
the information pursuant to a written 
agreement. Accordingly, if an issuer and 
a plan sponsor enter into a written 
agreement under which the issuer 
agrees to provide the information 
required under this paragraph (b) in 
compliance with this section, and the 
issuer fails to do so, then the issuer, but 
not the plan, violates the transparency 
disclosure requirements of this 
paragraph (b). 
(ii) Other contractual arrangements. A group health plan or health insurance 
issuer may satisfy the requirements 
under this paragraph (b) by entering into 
a written agreement under which 
another party (such as a third-party 
administrator or health care claims 
clearinghouse) will provide the 
information required by this paragraph 
(b) in compliance with this section. 
Notwithstanding the preceding 
sentence, if a plan or issuer chooses to 
enter into such an agreement and the 
party with which it contracts fails to 
provide the information in compliance 
with this paragraph (b), the plan or 
issuer violates the transparency 
disclosure requirements of this 
paragraph (b). 
(iii) Special rule for self-insured group health plans with respect to the 
disclosure of in-network rate machine- 
readable files. A self-insured group 
health plan that enters into an 
agreement with another party described 
in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section 
may permit such other party to make 
available in a single in-network rate 
machine readable file as required under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section the 
information required under paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) for each provider network used 
by more than one plan, insurance 
policy, or contract (including those 
offered by different plan sponsors with 
which the other party has an 
agreement)and across different health 
insurance markets, provided that— 
(A) Each in-network rate machine- 
readable file made available for a 
provider network includes the required 
information under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section for all covered items and 
services under each plan, insurance 
policy, or contract that uses the same 
provider network for which the in- 
network rate machine-readable file is 
made available; and 
(B) Each of the self-insured group 
health plan’s change-log, utilization, 
and taxonomy machine-readable files 
include the information required under 
paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this 
section, respectively, for the same plans, 
insurance policies, or contracts 
(including those offered by different 
plan sponsors and across different 
health insurance markets, if applicable) 
represented in the corresponding in- 
network rate machine-readable files 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section. 
(iv) Special rule for self-insured group health plans with respect to the 
disclosure of out-of-network allowed 
amount machine-readable files. A self- 
insured group health plan that enters 
into an agreement with another party 
described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this 
section may permit such other party to 
make available the information required 
under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section 
in a single out-of-network allowed 
amount file for more than one self- 
insured group health plan (including 
those offered by different plan sponsors 
with which the other party has an 
agreement), provided that the out-of- 
network allowed amount and billed 
charge data described in paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii)(C) of this section in relation to 
a particular item or service is omitted if 
it would require disclosure of out-of- 
network allowed amounts in connection 
with fewer than 11 different claims for 
payment of such item or service across 
all of the plans (including those offered 
by different plan sponsors) included in 
the out-of-network machine-readable 
file. 
(c) * * * 
(1)(i) Beginning on or after January 2, 
2022, the requirements of this section 
apply for plan years (in the individual 
market, for policy years). 
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section, paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section applies on [DATE 12 
MONTHS AFTER PUBLICATION OF 
FINAL REGULATIONS IN THE 
FEDERAL REGISTER]. Until such time, 
the current provisions of paragraph (b) 
of this section continue to apply.

§ 2590.715–2715A2 Transparency in 
coverage—required disclosures to 
participants and beneficiaries. 
* * * * * 
(b) * * * 
(1) * * * 
(i) * * * 
(A) If the request for cost-sharing 
information relates to items and services 
that are provided within a bundled 
payment arrangement, and the bundled 
payment arrangement includes items or 
services that have a separate cost- 
sharing liability, the group health plan 
or health insurance issuer must provide 
estimates of the cost-sharing liability for 
the requested covered item or service, as 
well as an estimate of the cost-sharing 
liability for each of the items and 
services in the bundled payment 
arrangement that have separate cost- 
sharing liabilities. While plans and 
issuers are not required to provide 
estimates of cost-sharing liability for a 
bundled payment arrangement where 
the cost-sharing is imposed separately 
for each item and service included in 
the bundled payment arrangement, 
nothing prohibits plans or issuers from 
providing estimates for multiple items 
and services in situations where such 
estimates could be relevant to 
participants or beneficiaries, as long as 
the plan or issuer also discloses 
information about the relevant items or 
services individually, as required in 
paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section. 
(B) For requested items and services 
that are recommended preventive 
services under section 2713 of the 
Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), if 
the group health plan or health 
insurance issuer cannot determine 
whether the request is for preventive or 
non-preventive purposes, the plan or 
issuer must display the cost-sharing 
liability that applies for non-preventive 
purposes. As an alternative, a plan or 
issuer may allow a participant or 
beneficiary to request cost-sharing 
information for the specific preventive 
or non-preventive item or service by 
including terms such as ‘‘preventive,’’ 
‘‘non-preventive,’’ or ‘‘diagnostic’’ as a 
means to request the most accurate cost- 
sharing information. 
* * * * * 
(vii) * * * 
(A) A statement that the cost-sharing 
information provided pursuant to this 
paragraph (b)(1) does not account for 
potential additional amounts in 
situations where applicable State or 
Federal law allow out-of-network 
providers to bill participants or 
beneficiaries for the difference between 
a provider’s billed charges and the sum 
of the amount collected from the group 
health plan or health insurance issuer 
and from the participants or 
beneficiaries in the form of a 
copayment, coinsurance, or deductible 
amount (the difference referred to as 
balance billing). This statement is not 
required if the State in which the item 
or service was furnished prohibits all 
out-of-network providers from balance 
billing for all items and services payable 
by the plan or issuer; 
* * * * * 
(2) * * * 
(ii) Paper method. Information provided under this paragraph (b) must 
be made available in plain language, 
without a fee, in paper form at the 
request of the participant or beneficiary. 
In responding to such a request, the 
group health plan or health insurance 
issuer may limit the number of 
providers with respect to which cost- 
sharing information for covered items 
and services is provided to no fewer 
than 20 providers per request. The plan 
or issuer is required to: 
* * * * * 
(iii) Phone method. Information provided under this paragraph (b) must 
be made available at the request of the 
participant or beneficiary via a 
telephone number through which a 
consumer may seek customer assistance 
that ERISA section 716(e) requires be 
indicated on any physical or electronic 
plan or insurance identification card 
issued to a participant, beneficiary, or 
enrollee. Such information must be 
accurate at the time of the request and 
must be provided at the time of the 
request. In responding to such a request, 
the group health plan or health 
insurance issuer may limit the number 
of providers with respect to which cost- 
sharing information for covered items 
and services is provided to no fewer 
than 20 providers per day. The plan or 
issuer is required to: 
(A) Disclose the applicable provider- 
per-day limit; and 
(B) Provide the cost-sharing 
information, in accordance with the 
requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) 
through (C) of this section. 
(iv) Alternative method. In circumstances where participants and 
beneficiaries request disclosure other 
than by the internet-based self-service 
tool, paper, or phone (for example, by 
email) group health plans and health 
insurance issuers may provide the 
disclosure through alternative means 
and satisfy the requirements of this 
section, provided the participant or 
beneficiary agrees that such disclosure 
through such means is sufficient to 
satisfy the request and the plan or issuer 
meets the timing requirements 
established under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) 
of this section for paper method 
disclosure. 
(3) * * * 
(i) Special rule for insured group health plans. To the extent coverage 
under a group health plan consists of 
group health insurance coverage, the 
plan satisfies the requirements of this 
paragraph (b) if the plan requires the 
health insurance issuer offering the 
coverage to provide the information 
required by this paragraph (b) in 
compliance with this section pursuant 
to a written agreement. Accordingly, if 
an issuer and a plan sponsor enter into 
a written agreement under which the 
issuer agrees to provide the information 
required under this paragraph (b) in 
compliance with this section, and the 
issuer fails to do so, then the issuer, but 
not the plan, violates the transparency 
disclosure requirements of this 
paragraph (b). 
(ii) Other contractual arrangements. A group health plan or health insurance 
issuer may satisfy the requirements 
under this paragraph (b) by entering into 
a written agreement under which 
another party (such as a pharmacy 
benefit manager or other third-party) 
provides the information required by 
this paragraph (b) in compliance with 
this section. Notwithstanding the 
preceding sentence, if a plan or issuer 
chooses to enter into such an agreement

k. Revising paragraph (c)(1). 
The revisions and additions read as 
follows: 
§ 2590.715–2715A3 Transparency in 
coverage—requirements for public 
disclosure. 
* * * * * 
(b) Requirements for public disclosure of in-network provider rates for covered 
items and services, out-of-network 
allowed amounts and billed charges for 
covered items and services, negotiated 
rates and historical net prices for 
covered prescription drugs, and 
contextual information. A group health 
plan or health insurance issuer must 
make available on an internet website 
the information required under 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section 
in machine-readable files, in accordance 
with the method and format 
requirements described in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, and that are 
updated as required under paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section. 
(1) * * * 
(i) An in-network rate machine- 
readable file for each provider network 
maintained or contracted by a group 
health plan or health insurance issuer 
that includes the required information 
under this paragraph (b)(1)(i) for all 
covered items and services under each 
coverage option offered by the plan or 
issuer that uses such provider network, 
except for prescription drugs that are 
subject to a fee-for-service 
reimbursement arrangement, which 
must be reported in the prescription 
drug machine-readable file pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. Each 
in-network rate machine-readable file 
must include: 
(A) The common provider network 
name; 
(B) For each coverage option offered 
by a group health plan or health 
insurance issuer that uses such provider 
network, the name; the Health Insurance 
Oversight System (HIOS) identifier, or, 
if no HIOS identifier is available, the 
Employer Identification Number (EIN); 
and the product type (for example, 
Health Maintenance Organization, 
Preferred Provider Organization); 
(C) A billing code, which in the case 
of prescription drugs must be an NDC, 
and a plain language description for 
each billing code for each covered item 
or service included in the machine- 
readable file; 
(D) For each covered item or service 
included in the machine-readable file, 
all applicable rates, which may include 
one or more of the following: Negotiated 
rates, underlying fee schedule rates, or 
derived amounts. If a group health plan 
or health insurance issuer does not use 
negotiated rates for provider 
reimbursement, then the plan or issuer 
should disclose derived amounts to the 
extent these amounts are already 
calculated in the normal course of 
business. If the plan or issuer uses 
underlying fee schedule rates for 
calculating cost sharing, then the plan 
or issuer should include the underlying 
fee schedule rates in addition to the 
negotiated rate or derived amount. 
Applicable rates, including for both 
individual items and services and items 
and services in a bundled payment 
arrangement, must be: 
(1) Reflected as dollar amounts, with 
respect to each covered item or service 
that is furnished by an in-network 
provider. If the negotiated rate is subject 
to change based upon participant or 
beneficiary-specific characteristics, 
these dollar amounts should be reflected 
as the base negotiated rate applicable to 
the item or service prior to adjustments 
for participant or beneficiary-specific 
characteristics. For contractual 
arrangements under which a group 
health plan or health insurance issuer 
agrees to pay an in-network provider a 
percentage of billed charges and is not 
able to assign a dollar amount to an item 
or service prior to a bill being generated, 
plans and issuers must report a 
percentage number, in lieu of a dollar 
amount, in a form and manner as 
specified in guidance issued by the 
Department of the Treasury, the 
Department of Labor, and the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
(2) Associated with the National 
Provider Identifier (NPI), Tax 
Identification Number (TIN), and Place 
of Service Code for each in-network 
provider, except those specified in 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(F) of this section; 
(3) Associated with the last date of the 
contract term or expiration date for each 
provider-specific applicable rate that 
applies to each covered item or service; 
and 
(4) Indicated with a notation where a 
reimbursement arrangement other than 
a standard fee-for-service model (such 
as capitation or a bundled payment 
arrangement) applies. 
(E) Current numerical enrollment 
totals, as of the date the file is posted, 
for each coverage option offered by a 
group health plan or health insurance 
issuer that uses such provider network. 
Such numerical enrollment totals must 
include the number of participants and 
beneficiaries (including all dependents) 
in the coverage option offered by a plan 
or issuer. 
(F) A group health plan or health 
insurance issuer must exclude from 
each file under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section a provider and their negotiated 
rate (provider-rate combination) for an 
item or service if the plan or issuer 
determines it is unlikely that the 
provider would be reimbursed for the 
item or service given that provider’s 
area of specialty according to the plan’s 
or issuer’s internal provider taxonomy 
used during the claims adjudication 
process.

as defined in § 2590.715– 
2715A1(a)(2)(x), in which a group 
health plan or health insurance issuer 
offers a plan or coverage, an out-of- 
network allowed amount machine- 
readable file, including: 
(A) For each coverage option offered 
by a group health plan or health 
insurance issuer in such health 
insurance market, the name and the 
HIOS identifier, or, if no HIOS identifier 
is available, the EIN; and the product 
type (for example, Health Maintenance 
Organization, Preferred Provider 
Organization); 
(B) A billing code, which in the case 
of prescription drugs must be an NDC, 
and a plain language description for 
each billing code for each covered item 
or service under any coverage option 
offered by a group health plan or health 
insurance issuer in such health 
insurance market; and 
(C) Aggregated unique out-of-network 
allowed amounts and billed charges 
with respect to each covered item or 
service under any coverage option 
offered by a group health plan or health 
insurance issuer in such health 
insurance market furnished by out-of- 
network providers during the 6-month 
time period that begins 9 months prior 
to the publication date of the machine- 
readable file (except that a plan or issuer 
must omit such data in relation to a 
particular item or service when 
compliance with this paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii)(C) would require the plan or 
issuer to report payment of out-of- 
network allowed amounts in connection 
with fewer than 11 different claims for 
payment of that item or service in a 
single health insurance market). 
Consistent with paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, nothing in this paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii)(C) requires the disclosure of 
information that would violate any 
applicable health information privacy 
law. Each unique out-of-network 
allowed amount must be: 
(1) Reflected as a dollar amount, with 
respect to each covered item or service 
that is furnished by an out-of-network 
provider; and 
(2) Associated with the NPI, TIN, and 
Place of Service Code for each out-of- 
network provider. 
* * * * * 
(2) Required contextual files. A group health plan or health insurance issuer 
must make available in a machine- 
readable format: 
(i) A change-log file, for each in- 
network rate machine-readable file 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section, that identifies any changes 
made to the required information 
described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section since the immediately preceding 
published in-network rate machine- 
readable file. 
(ii) A utilization file, for each in- 
network rate machine-readable file 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section, that includes, for the 12-month 
period that ends 6 months prior to the 
publication date of each utilization file: 
(A) Items and services covered under 
the plans or policies included in the 
files prepared as specified in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section for which a claim 
has been submitted and reimbursed, in 
whole or in part; and 
(B) Each in-network provider 
identified by the NPI, TIN, and Place of 
Service Code who was reimbursed, in 
whole or in part, for a claim for each 
covered item or service included as 
specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of 
this section. 
(iii) A taxonomy file, for each in- 
network rate machine-readable file 
prepared as specified in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section, which includes 
the group health plan’s or health 
insurance issuer’s internal provider 
taxonomy that matches items and 
services (represented by a billing code) 
with provider specialties (represented 
by specialty codes which are derived 
from the Health Care Provider 
Taxonomy code set established by the 
National Uniform Claim Committee 
(NUCC)) to determine if the plan or 
issuer should deny reimbursement for 
an item or service because it was not 
furnished by a provider in an 
appropriate specialty.. Plans and issuers 
must use their internal provider 
taxonomy to determine whether to 
exclude certain provider-rate 
combinations from the in-network rate 
machine-readable file as specified in 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(F) of this section. 
(iv) A plain text file in a .txt format 
in the root folder (that is, the top-level 
directory on an electronic file system) of 
a group health plan’s or health 
insurance issuer’s website that includes: 
(A) The source page URL for the 
internet website that hosts the machine- 
readable files required under paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (2) of this section; 
(B) A direct link to the URL for the 
machine-readable files required under 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section; 
and 
(C) Point-of-contact information, 
including an up-to-date name, title, and 
email address for an individual who can 
address inquiries and issues related to 
the machine-readable files required 
under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this 
section. This contact information must 
be prominently displayed on the same 
website where the machine-readable 
files are made available and be kept 
updated per the requirements in 
paragraph (b)(4)(vi) of this section. 
(3) Required method and format for disclosing information to the public. (i) 
The machine-readable files described in 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section 
must be available in a form and manner 
as specified in guidance issued by the 
Department of the Treasury, the 
Department of Labor, and the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
(ii) The machine-readable files must 
be publicly available and accessible to 
any person, automated scripts, or web 
crawlers free of charge and without 
conditions, such as establishment of a 
user account, password, submission of 
personally identifiable information or 
other credentials, or blocking server 
configurations or firewalls to access the 
file. 
(iii) The source page URL for the 
internet website that hosts the machine- 
readable files required under paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (2) of this section must be 
included as a link in the footer on the 
home page of the group health plan’s or 
health insurance issuer’s website, as 
well as any page of the website that 
features a footer, that is labeled ‘‘Price 
Transparency’’ or ‘‘Transparency in 
Coverage’’ and links directly to the 
publicly available web page that hosts 
the link to the machine-readable files. 
(iv) The group health plan or health 
insurance issuer may satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of 
this section by entering into a written 
agreement under which another party 
(such as a third-party administrator) 
posts the machine-readable files on its 
public website on behalf of the plan or 
issuer, including if the plan or issuer 
does not have a website. However, if the 
files are posted on a service provider’s 
website, and the plan or issuer 
maintains a public website but chooses 
not to host the files separately on its 
own public website, it must provide a 
link on its own public website to the 
location where the files are made 
publicly available. 
(4) Timing. A group health plan or health insurance issuer must update the 
machine-readable files in accordance 
with the following timeframes and 
clearly indicate the date that the files 
were most recently updated: 
(i) The in-network rate and out-of- 
network allowed amount machine- 
readable files required by paragraphs 
(b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section must be 
updated and posted quarterly beginning 
on the first day of the calendar-year 
quarter following the applicability date 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section;

readable file required by paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section must be 
updated monthly; 
(iii) The change-log machine-readable 
file required by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
this section must be updated and posted 
quarterly beginning on the first day of 
the calendar-year quarter following the 
date on which the first in-network rate 
machine-readable file is required to be 
posted under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this 
section in accordance with the 
applicability date of the amendments to 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section as 
specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section. If there are no changes to the in- 
network rate machine-readable file 
described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section since the last such file was 
updated, a change-log machine-readable 
file must still be updated and posted 
quarterly indicating there are no 
changes; 
(iv) The utilization machine-readable 
file required under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) 
of this section must be updated and 
posted annually beginning on the first 
day of the calendar-year quarter 
following the applicability date under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section; 
(v) The taxonomy machine-readable 
file required under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) 
of this section must be updated and 
posted quarterly beginning on the first 
day of the calendar-year quarter 
following the applicability date under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If there 
are no changes to the taxonomy that 
affect the information required in the 
machine-readable file required under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section in a 
subsequent quarter, the posted 
taxonomy file is not required to updated 
that quarter; and 
(vi) The text file required by 
paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section must 
be posted beginning on the first day of 
the calendar-year quarter following the 
applicability date under paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section and subsequently 
updated and posted as soon as 
practicable but no later than 7 calendar 
days following a change in any of the 
information required under paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv) of this section. 
(5) Special rules to prevent unnecessary duplication—(i) Special rule for insured group health plans. To 
the extent coverage under a group 
health plan consists of group health 
insurance coverage, the plan satisfies 
the requirements of this paragraph (b) if 
the plan requires the health insurance 
issuer offering the coverage to provide 
the information pursuant to a written 
agreement. Accordingly, if an issuer and 
a plan sponsor enter into a written 
agreement under which the issuer 
agrees to provide the information 
required under this paragraph (b) in 
compliance with this section, and the 
issuer fails to do so, then the issuer, but 
not the plan, violates the transparency 
disclosure requirements of this 
paragraph (b). 
(ii) Other contractual arrangements. A group health plan or health insurance 
issuer may satisfy the requirements 
under this paragraph (b) by entering into 
a written agreement under which 
another party (such as a third-party 
administrator or health care claims 
clearinghouse) will provide the 
information required by this paragraph 
(b) in compliance with this section. 
Notwithstanding the preceding 
sentence, if a plan or issuer chooses to 
enter into such an agreement and the 
party with which it contracts fails to 
provide the information in compliance 
with this paragraph (b), the plan or 
issuer violates the transparency 
disclosure requirements of this 
paragraph (b). 
(iii) Special rule for self-insured group health plans with respect to the 
disclosure of in-network rate machine- 
readable files. A self-insured group 
health plan that enters into an 
agreement with another party described 
in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section 
may permit such other party to make 
available in a single in-network rate 
machine-readable file as required under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section the 
information required under paragraph 
(b)(1)(i)for each provider network used 
by more than one plan, insurance 
policy, or contract (including those 
offered by different plan sponsors with 
which the other party has an agreement) 
and across different health insurance 
markets, provided that— 
(A) Each in-network rate machine- 
readable file made available for a 
provider network includes the required 
information under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section for all covered items and 
services under each plan, insurance 
policy, or contract that uses the same 
provider network for which the in- 
network rate machine-readable file is 
made available; and 
(B) Each of the self-insured group 
health plan’s change-log, utilization, 
and taxonomy machine-readable files 
include the information required under 
paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this 
section, respectively, for the same plans, 
insurance policies, or contracts 
(including those offered by different 
plan sponsors and across different 
health insurance markets, if applicable) 
represented in the corresponding in- 
network rate machine-readable files 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section. 
(iv) Special rule for self-insured group health plans with respect to the 
disclosure of out-of-network allowed 
amount machine-readable files. A self- 
insured group health plan that enters 
into an agreement with another party 
described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this 
section may permit such other party to 
make available the information required 
under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section 
in a single out-of-network allowed 
amount file for more than one self- 
insured group health plan (including 
those offered by different plan sponsors 
with which the other party has an 
agreement), provided that the out-of- 
network allowed amount and billed 
charge data described in paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii)(C) of this section in relation to 
a particular item or service is omitted if 
it would require disclosure of out-of- 
network allowed amounts in connection 
with fewer than 11 different claims for 
payment of such item or service across 
all of the plans (including those offered 
by different plan sponsors) included in 
the out-of-network machine-readable 
file. 
(c) * * * 
(1)(i) Beginning on or after January 2, 
2022, the requirements of this section 
apply for plan years (in the individual 
market, for policy years). 
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section, paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section applies on [DATE 12 
MONTHS AFTER PUBLICATION OF 
FINAL REGULATIONS IN THE 
FEDERAL REGISTER]. Until such time, 
the current provisions of paragraph (b) 
of this section continue to apply.

The revisions and additions read as 
follows: 
§ 147.211 Transparency in coverage— 
required disclosures to participants, 
beneficiaries, or enrollees. 
* * * * * 
(b) * * * 
(1) * * * 
(i) * * * 
(A) If the request for cost-sharing 
information relates to items and services 
that are provided within a bundled 
payment arrangement, and the bundled 
payment arrangement includes items or 
services that have a separate cost- 
sharing liability, the group health plan 
or health insurance issuer must provide 
estimates of the cost-sharing liability for 
the requested covered item or service, as 
well as an estimate of the cost-sharing 
liability for each of the items and 
services in the bundled payment 
arrangement that have separate cost- 
sharing liabilities. While plans and 
issuers are not required to provide 
estimates of cost-sharing liability for a 
bundled payment arrangement where 
the cost-sharing is imposed separately 
for each item and service included in 
the bundled payment arrangement, 
nothing prohibits plans or issuers from 
providing estimates for multiple items 
and services in situations where such 
estimates could be relevant to 
participants or beneficiaries, as long as 
the plan or issuer also discloses 
information about the relevant items or 
services individually, as required in 
paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section. 
(B) For requested items and services 
that are recommended preventive 
services under section 2713 of the 
Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), if 
the group health plan or health 
insurance issuer cannot determine 
whether the request is for preventive or 
non-preventive purposes, the plan or 
issuer must display the cost-sharing 
liability that applies for non-preventive 
purposes. As an alternative, a plan or 
issuer may allow a participant, 
beneficiary, or enrollee to request cost- 
sharing information for the specific 
preventive or non-preventive item or 
service by including terms such as 
‘‘preventive,’’ ‘‘non-preventive,’’ or 
‘‘diagnostic’’ as a means to request the 
most accurate cost-sharing information. 
* * * * * 
(vii) * * * 
(A) A statement that the cost-sharing 
information provided pursuant to this 
paragraph (b)(1) does not account for 
potential additional amounts in 
situations where applicable State or 
Federal law allow out-of-network 
providers to bill participants, 
beneficiaries, or enrollees for the 
difference between a provider’s billed 
charges and the sum of the amount 
collected from the group health plan or 
health insurance issuer and from the 
participants, beneficiaries, or enrollees 
in the form of a copayment, 
coinsurance, or deductible amount (the 
difference referred to as balance billing). 
This statement is not required if the 
State in which the item or service was 
furnished prohibits all out-of-network 
providers from balance billing for all 
items and services payable by the plan 
or issuer; 
* * * * * 
(2) * * * 
(ii) Paper method. Information provided under this paragraph (b) must 
be made available in plain language, 
without a fee, in paper form at the 
request of the participant, beneficiary, 
or enrollee. In responding to such a 
request, the group health plan or health 
insurance issuer may limit the number 
of providers with respect to which cost- 
sharing information for covered items 
and services is provided to no fewer 
than 20 providers per request. The plan 
or issuer is required to: 
* * * * * 
(iii) Phone method. Information provided under this paragraph (b) must 
be made available at the request of the 
participant, beneficiary, or enrollee via 
a telephone number through which a 
consumer may seek customer assistance 
that PHS Act section 2799A–1(e) 
required be indicated on any physical or 
electronic plan or insurance 
identification card issued to a 
participant, beneficiary, or enrollee. 
Such information must be accurate at 
the time of the request and must be 
provided at the time of the request. In 
responding to such a request, the group 
health plan or health insurance issuer 
may limit the number of providers with 
respect to which cost-sharing 
information for covered items and 
services is provided to no fewer than 20 
providers per day. The plan or issuer is 
required to: 
(A) Disclose the applicable provider- 
per-day limit; and 
(B) Provide the cost-sharing 
information, in accordance with the 
requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) 
through (C) of this section. 
(iv) Alternative method. In circumstances where participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees request 
disclosure other than by the internet- 
based self-service tool, paper, or phone 
(for example, by email) group health 
plans and health insurance issuers may 
provide the disclosure through 
alternative means and satisfy the 
requirements of this section, provided 
the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee 
agrees that such disclosure through such 
means is sufficient to satisfy the request 
and the plan or issuer meets the timing 
requirements established under 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section for 
paper method disclosure. 
(3) * * * 
(i) Special rule for insured group health plans. To the extent coverage 
under a group health plan consists of 
group health insurance coverage, the 
plan satisfies the requirements of this 
paragraph (b) if the plan requires the 
health insurance issuer offering the 
coverage to provide the information 
required by this paragraph (b) in 
compliance with this section pursuant 
to a written agreement. Accordingly, if 
an issuer and a plan sponsor enter into 
a written agreement under which the 
issuer agrees to provide the information 
required under this paragraph (b) in 
compliance with this section, and the 
issuer fails to do so, then the issuer, but 
not the plan, violates the transparency 
disclosure requirements of this 
paragraph (b).

147.212 Transparency in coverage— 
requirements for public disclosure. 
* * * * * 
(b) Requirements for public disclosure of in-network provider rates for covered 
items and services, out-of-network 
allowed amounts and billed charges for 
covered items and services, negotiated 
rates and historical net prices for 
covered prescription drugs, and 
contextual information. A group health 
plan or health insurance issuer must 
make available on an internet website 
the information required under 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section 
in machine-readable files, in accordance 
with the method and format 
requirements described in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, and that are 
updated as required under paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section. 
(1) * * * 
(i) An in-network rate machine- 
readable file for each provider network 
maintained or contracted by a group 
health plan or health insurance issuer 
that includes the required information 
under this paragraph (b)(1)(i) for all 
covered items and services under each 
coverage option offered by the plan or 
issuer that uses such provider network, 
except for prescription drugs that are 
subject to a fee-for-service 
reimbursement arrangement, which 
must be reported in the prescription 
drug machine-readable file pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. Each 
in-network rate machine-readable file 
must include: 
(A) The common provider network 
name; 
(B) For each coverage option offered 
by a group health plan or health 
insurance issuer that uses such provider 
network, the name; the Health Insurance 
Oversight System (HIOS) identifier, or, 
if no HIOS identifier is available, the 
Employer Identification Number (EIN); 
and the product type (for example, 
Health Maintenance Organization, 
Preferred Provider Organization); 
(C) A billing code, which in the case 
of prescription drugs must be an NDC, 
and a plain language description for 
each billing code for each covered item 
or service included in the machine- 
readable file; 
(D) For each covered item or service 
included in the machine-readable file, 
all applicable rates, which may include 
one or more of the following: Negotiated 
rates, underlying fee schedule rates, or 
derived amounts. If a group health plan 
or health insurance issuer does not use 
negotiated rates for provider 
reimbursement, then the plan or issuer 
should disclose derived amounts to the 
extent these amounts are already 
calculated in the normal course of 
business. If the plan or issuer uses 
underlying fee schedule rates for 
calculating cost sharing, then the plan 
or issuer should include the underlying 
fee schedule rates in addition to the 
negotiated rate or derived amount. 
Applicable rates, including for both 
individual items and services and items 
and services in a bundled payment 
arrangement, must be: 
(1) Reflected as dollar amounts, with 
respect to each covered item or service 
that is furnished by an in-network 
provider. If the negotiated rate is subject 
to change based upon participant, 
beneficiary, or enrollee-specific 
characteristics, these dollar amounts 
should be reflected as the base 
negotiated rate applicable to the item or 
service prior to adjustments for 
participant, beneficiary, or enrollee- 
specific characteristics. For contractual 
arrangements under which a group 
health plan or health insurance issuer 
agrees to pay an in-network provider a 
percentage of billed charges and is not 
able to assign a dollar amount to an item 
or service prior to a bill being generated, 
plans and issuers must report a 
percentage number, in lieu of a dollar 
amount, in a form and manner as 
specified in guidance issued by the 
Department of the Treasury, the 
Department of Labor, and the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
(2) Associated with the National 
Provider Identifier (NPI), Tax 
Identification Number (TIN), and Place 
of Service Code for each in-network 
provider, except those specified in 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(F) of this section; 
(3) Associated with the last date of the 
contract term or expiration date for each 
provider-specific applicable rate that 
applies to each covered item or service; 
and 
(4) Indicated with a notation where a 
reimbursement arrangement other than 
a standard fee-for-service model (such 
as capitation or a bundled payment 
arrangement) applies. 
(E) Current numerical enrollment 
totals, as of the date the file is posted, 
for each coverage option offered by a 
group health plan or health insurance 
issuer that uses such provider network. 
Such numerical enrollment totals must 
include the number of participants, 
beneficiaries, and enrollees (including 
all dependents) in the coverage option 
offered by a plan or issuer.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS460517 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules (F) A group health plan or health 
insurance issuer must exclude from 
each file under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section a provider and their negotiated 
rate (provider-rate combination) for an 
item or service if the plan or issuer 
determines it is unlikely that the 
provider would be reimbursed for the 
item or service given that provider’s 
area of specialty according to the plan’s 
or issuer’s internal provider taxonomy 
used during the claims adjudication 
process. 
(ii) For each health insurance market, 
as defined in § 147.210(a)(2)(xi), in 
which a group health plan or health 
insurance issuer offers a plan or 
coverage, an out-of-network allowed 
amount machine-readable file, 
including: 
(A) For each coverage option offered 
by a group health plan or health 
insurance issuer in such health 
insurance market, the name and the 
HIOS identifier, or, if no HIOS identifier 
is available, the EIN; and the product 
type (for example, Health Maintenance 
Organization, Preferred Provider 
Organization); 
(B) A billing code, which in the case 
of prescription drugs must be an NDC, 
and a plain language description for 
each billing code for each covered item 
or service under any coverage option 
offered by a group health plan or health 
insurance issuer in such health 
insurance market; and 
(C) Aggregated unique out-of-network 
allowed amounts and billed charges 
with respect to each covered item or 
service under any coverage option 
offered by a group health plan or health 
insurance issuer in such health 
insurance market furnished by out-of- 
network providers during the 6-month 
time period that begins 9 months prior 
to the publication date of the machine- 
readable file (except that a plan or issuer 
must omit such data in relation to a 
particular item or service when 
compliance with this paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii)(C) would require the plan or 
issuer to report payment of out-of- 
network allowed amounts in connection 
with fewer than 11 different claims for 
payment of that item or service in a 
single health insurance market). 
Consistent with paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, nothing in this paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii)(C) requires the disclosure of 
information that would violate any 
applicable health information privacy 
law. Each unique out-of-network 
allowed amount must be: 
(1) Reflected as a dollar amount, with 
respect to each covered item or service 
that is furnished by an out-of-network 
provider; and 
(2) Associated with the NPI, TIN, and 
Place of Service Code for each out-of- 
network provider. 
* * * * * 
(2) Required contextual files. A group health plan or health insurance issuer 
must make available in a machine- 
readable format: 
(i) A change-log file, for each in- 
network rate machine-readable file 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section, that identifies any changes 
made to the required information 
described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section since the immediately preceding 
published in-network rate machine- 
readable file. 
(ii) A utilization file, for each in- 
network rate machine-readable file 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section, that includes, for the 12-month 
period that ends 6 months prior to the 
publication date of each utilization file: 
(A) Items and services covered under 
the plans or policies included in the 
files prepared as specified in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section for which a claim 
has been submitted and reimbursed, in 
whole or in part; and 
(B) Each in-network provider 
identified by the NPI, TIN, and Place of 
Service Code who was reimbursed, in 
whole or in part, for a claim for each 
covered item or service included as 
specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of 
this section. 
(iii) A taxonomy file, for each in- 
network rate machine-readable file 
prepared as specified in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section, which includes 
the group health plan’s or health 
insurance issuer’s internal provider 
taxonomy that matches items and 
services (represented by a billing code) 
with provider specialties (represented 
by specialty codes which are derived 
from the Health Care Provider 
Taxonomy code set established by the 
National Uniform Claim Committee 
(NUCC)) to determine if the plan or 
issuer should deny reimbursement for 
an item or service because it was not 
furnished by a provider in an 
appropriate specialty. Plans and issuers 
must use their internal provider 
taxonomy to determine whether to 
exclude certain provider-rate 
combinations from the in-network rate 
machine-readable file as specified in 
paragraph (b)(1)(i)(F) of this section. (iv) 
A plain text file in a .txt format in the 
root folder (that is, the top-level 
directory on an electronic file system) of 
a group health plan’s or health 
insurance issuer’s website that includes: 
(A) The source page URL for the 
internet website that hosts the machine- 
readable files required under paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (2) of this section; 
(B) A direct link to the URL for the 
machine-readable files required under 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section; 
and 
(C) Point-of-contact information, 
including an up-to-date name, title, and 
email address for an individual who can 
address inquiries and issues related to 
the machine-readable files required 
under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this 
section. This contact information must 
be prominently displayed on the same 
website where the machine-readable 
files are made available and be kept 
updated per the requirements in 
paragraph (b)(4)(vi) of this section. 
(3) Required method and format for disclosing information to the public. (i) 
The machine-readable files described in 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section 
must be available in a form and manner 
as specified in guidance issued by the 
Department of the Treasury, the 
Department of Labor, and the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
(ii) The machine-readable files must 
be publicly available and accessible to 
any person, automated scripts, or web 
crawlers free of charge and without 
conditions, such as establishment of a 
user account, password, submission of 
personally identifiable information or 
other credentials, or blocking server 
configurations or firewalls to access the 
file. 
(iii) The source page URL for the 
internet website that hosts the machine- 
readable files required under paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (2) of this section must be 
included as a link in the footer on the 
home page of the group health plan’s or 
health insurance issuer’s website, as 
well as any page of the website that 
features a footer, that is labeled ‘‘Price 
Transparency’’ or ‘‘Transparency in 
Coverage’’ and links directly to the 
publicly available web page that hosts 
the link to the machine-readable files. 
(iv) The group health plan or health 
insurance issuer may satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of 
this section by entering into a written 
agreement under which another party 
(such as a third-party administrator) 
posts the machine-readable files on its 
public website on behalf of the plan or 
issuer, including if the plan or issuer 
does not have a website. However, if the 
files are posted on a service provider’s 
website, and the plan or issuer 
maintains a public website but chooses 
not to host the files separately on its 
own public website, it must provide a 
link on its own public website to the 
location where the files are made 
publicly available.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS460518 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 244 / Tuesday, December 23, 2025 / Proposed Rules machine-readable files in accordance 
with the following timeframes and 
clearly indicate the date that the files 
were most recently updated: 
(i) The in-network rate and out-of- 
network allowed amount machine- 
readable files required by paragraphs 
(b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section must be 
updated and posted quarterly beginning 
on the first day of the calendar-year 
quarter following the applicability date 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section; 
(ii) The prescription drug machine- 
readable file required by paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section must be 
updated monthly; 
(iii) The change-log machine-readable 
file required by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
this section must be updated and posted 
quarterly beginning on the first day of 
the calendar-year quarter following the 
date on which the first in-network rate 
machine-readable file is required to be 
posted under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this 
section in accordance with the 
applicability date of the amendments to 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section as 
specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section. If there are no changes to the in- 
network rate machine-readable file 
described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section since the last such file was 
updated, a change-log machine-readable 
file must still be updated and posted 
quarterly indicating there are no 
changes; 
(iv) The utilization machine-readable 
file required under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) 
of this section must be updated and 
posted annually beginning on the first 
day of the calendar-year quarter 
following the applicability date under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section; 
(v) The taxonomy machine-readable 
file required under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) 
of this section must be updated and 
posted quarterly beginning on the first 
day of the calendar-year quarter 
following the applicability date under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If there 
are no changes to the taxonomy that 
affect the information required in the 
machine-readable file required under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section in a 
subsequent quarter, the posted 
taxonomy file is not required to updated 
that quarter; and 
(vi) The text file required by 
paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section must 
be posted beginning on the first day of 
the calendar-year quarter following the 
applicability date under paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section and subsequently 
updated and posted as soon as 
practicable but no later than 7 calendar 
days following a change in any of the 
information required under paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv) of this section. 
(5) Special rules to prevent unnecessary duplication—(i) Special rule for insured group health plans. To 
the extent coverage under a group 
health plan consists of group health 
insurance coverage, the plan satisfies 
the requirements of this paragraph (b) if 
the plan requires the health insurance 
issuer offering the coverage to provide 
the information pursuant to a written 
agreement. Accordingly, if an issuer and 
a plan sponsor enter into a written 
agreement under which the issuer 
agrees to provide the information 
required under this paragraph (b) in 
compliance with this section, and the 
issuer fails to do so, then the issuer, but 
not the plan, violates the transparency 
disclosure requirements of this 
paragraph (b). 
(ii) Other contractual arrangements. A group health plan or health insurance 
issuer may satisfy the requirements 
under this paragraph (b) by entering into 
a written agreement under which 
another party (such as a third-party 
administrator or health care claims 
clearinghouse) will provide the 
information required by this paragraph 
(b) in compliance with this section. 
Notwithstanding the preceding 
sentence, if a plan or issuer chooses to 
enter into such an agreement and the 
party with which it contracts fails to 
provide the information in compliance 
with this paragraph (b), the plan or 
issuer violates the transparency 
disclosure requirements of this 
paragraph (b). 
(iii) Special rule for self-insured group health plans with respect to the 
disclosure of in-network rate machine- 
readable files. A self-insured group 
health plan that enters into an 
agreement with another party described 
in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section 
may permit such other party to make 
available in a single in-network rate 
machine-readable file as required under 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section the 
information required under paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) for each provider network used 
by more than one plan, insurance 
policy, or contract(including those 
offered by different plan sponsors with 
which the other party has an agreement) 
and across different health insurance 
markets, provided that— 
(A) Each in-network rate machine- 
readable file made available for a 
provider network includes the required 
information under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section for all covered items and 
services under each plan, insurance 
policy, or contract that uses the same 
provider network for which the in- 
network rate machine-readable file is 
made available; and 
(B) Each of the self-insured group 
health plan’s change-log, utilization, 
and taxonomy machine-readable files 
include the information required under 
paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this 
section, respectively, for the same plans, 
insurance policies, or contracts 
(including those offered by different 
plan sponsors and across different 
health insurance markets, if applicable) 
represented in the corresponding in- 
network rate machine-readable files 
specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section. 
(iv) Special rule for self-insured group health plans with respect to the 
disclosure of out-of-network allowed 
amount machine-readable files. A self- 
insured group health plan that enters 
into an agreement with another party 
described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this 
section may permit such other party to 
make available the information required 
under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section 
in a single out-of-network allowed 
amount file for more than one self- 
insured group health plan (including 
those offered by different plan sponsors 
with which the other party has an 
agreement), provided that the out-of- 
network allowed amount and billed 
charge data described in paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii)(C) of this section in relation to 
a particular item or service is omitted if 
it would require disclosure of out-of- 
network allowed amounts in connection 
with fewer than 11 different claims for 
payment of such item or service across 
all of the plans (including those offered 
by different plan sponsors) included in 
the out-of-network machine-readable 
file. 
(c) * * * 
(1)(i) Beginning on or after January 2, 
2022, the requirements of this section 
apply for plan years (in the individual 
market, for policy years). 
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section, paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section applies on [DATE 12 
MONTHS AFTER PUBLICATION OF 
FINAL REGULATIONS IN THE 
FEDERAL REGISTER]. Until such time, 
the current provisions of paragraph (b) 
of this section continue to apply.

Increasing Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered: 
Section 1. Purpose and Policy. Americans deserve access to the best medical treatments and research infrastructure in the world. In 2023, the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) completed a review of the landscape of medical 
use of marijuana and found scientific support for its use to treat anorexia 
related to a medical condition, nausea and vomiting, and pain. Chronic 
pain affects nearly 1 in 4 United States adults and more than 1 in 3 
United States seniors, and 6 in 10 people who use medical marijuana report 
doing so to manage pain. Forty States plus the District of Columbia have 
State- or locally-sanctioned, regulated medical marijuana programs. Yet dec-
ades of Federal drug control policy have neglected marijuana’s medical 
uses. That oversight has limited the ability of scientists and manufacturers 
to complete the necessary research on safety and efficacy to inform doctors 
and patients. 
Marijuana is currently controlled under Schedule I of the Controlled Sub-
stances Act (CSA). In 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS) recommended to the Drug Enforcement Agency that marijuana be 
controlled under Schedule III of the CSA. Schedule I drugs are defined 
as drugs with no currently accepted medical use, a high potential for abuse, 
and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. 
Schedule III drugs are classified as having a potential for abuse less than 
the drugs or other substances in Schedules I and II, a currently accepted 
medical use in treatment in the United States, and a potential for moderate 
or low physical dependence or high psychological dependence in the event 
of drug abuse. 
The recommendation from HHS included a determination that medical mari-
juana has a currently accepted medical use. That determination was based 
in part on a finding by the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health 
that more than 30,000 licensed healthcare practitioners across 43 United 
States jurisdictions are authorized to recommend the medical use of mari-
juana for more than 6 million registered patients to treat at least 15 medical 
conditions. It was also based on a finding by the FDA of credible scientific 
support to substantiate the use of marijuana in the treatment of pain, anorexia 
related to certain medical conditions, and nausea and vomiting induced 
by chemotherapy. The National Institute on Drug Abuse concurred with 
the FDA’s recommendation that marijuana be rescheduled from Schedule 
I to Schedule III of the CSA. In May 2024, the Department of Justice issued 
a proposed rule to reschedule marijuana to Schedule III. The proposed 
rule received nearly 43,000 public comments and is currently awaiting an 
administrative law hearing. 
The Federal Government’s long delay in recognizing the medical use of 
marijuana does not serve the Americans who report health benefits from 
the medical use of marijuana to ease chronic pain and other various medically 
recognized ailments. Americans who often seek alternative relief from chronic 
pain symptoms are particularly impacted. For example, in one research 
survey, 20 percent of participating United States veterans reported using 
fewer opioids as a result of their medical marijuana use. One in 10 seniors 
used marijuana in the last year and some evidence shows improvements

use. However, the current Schedule I position of marijuana has impeded 
research. The lack of appropriate research on medical marijuana and con-
sequent lack of FDA approval leaves American patients and doctors without 
adequate guidance on appropriate prescribing and utilization. One patient 
survey showed that just 56 percent of older Americans using marijuana 
have discussed the usage with their healthcare provider. This places patients, 
especially seniors who may be on multiple medications, at increased risk 
of drug interactions or other adverse events. The Federal Government must 
improve the research infrastructure for medical marijuana to better serve 
Americans. 
In addition to medical marijuana, which is primarily made up of two 
cannabinoids—cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydracannabinol (THC)—hemp- 
derived cannabinoid products, defined by section 297A of the Agricultural 
Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1639o), have shown potential to improve 
patient symptoms for common ailments and are frequently used by Ameri-
cans. One in 5 United States adults and nearly 15 percent of seniors reported 
using CBD in the past year, and chronic pain patients have reported improve-
ments with CBD use in clinical studies. Furthermore, evidence suggests 
that the amount of THC in hemp-derived cannabinoid products can affect 
both pain treatment efficacy and adverse events. Hemp-derived cannabinoids, 
as defined in 7 U.S.C. 1639o, are not controlled substances under the CSA 
but are subject to the same authorities and requirements as FDA-regulated 
products containing any other substance. Adding complexity is the fact 
that some full-spectrum CBD products will once again be controlled as 
marijuana under the CSA when section 781 of Public Law 119–37 goes 
into effect because they contain THC levels above the per-container threshold 
set by that law. Further, a recent study found that some commercially 
available CBD products evaluated were inaccurately labeled regarding CBD 
isolate, broad-spectrum, or full-spectrum composition, posing safety risks 
for consumers. In short, the current legal landscape leaves American patients 
and doctors without adequate guidance or product safeguards for CBD. 
It is the policy of my Administration to increase medical marijuana and 
CBD research to better inform patients and doctors. It is critical to close 
the gap between current medical marijuana and CBD use and medical knowl-
edge of risks and benefits, including for specific populations and conditions. 
Research methods and models should include real-world evidence and 
should facilitate affordable access in order to rapidly assess the health out-
comes of medical marijuana and legal CBD products while focusing on 
long-term health effects in vulnerable populations like adolescents and young 
adults. 
Sec. 2. Rescheduling Medical Marijuana and Improving Access to Cannabidiol Products. (a) The Attorney General shall take all necessary 
steps to complete the rulemaking process related to rescheduling marijuana 
to Schedule III of the CSA in the most expeditious manner in accordance 
with Federal law, including 21 U.S.C. 811. 
(b) The Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Legislative, 
Political, and Public Affairs shall work with the Congress to update the 
statutory definition of final hemp-derived cannabinoid products to allow 
Americans to benefit from access to appropriate full-spectrum CBD products 
while preserving the Congress’s intent to restrict the sale of products that 
pose serious health risks. This will include consultation with appropriate 
executive departments and agencies and authorities to develop a regulatory 
framework for hemp-derived cannabinoid products, including development 
of guidance on an upper limit on milligrams of THC per serving with 
considerations on per container limits and CBD to THC ratio requirements. 
The Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Commissioner of Food 
and Drugs, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health shall develop 
research methods and models utilizing real-world evidence to improve access
