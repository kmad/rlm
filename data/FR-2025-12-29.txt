SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Policy Objectives 
The objectives of the final rule are to 
improve the speed and certainty of, and 
reduce the regulatory burden associated 
with, the filing process for insured State 
nonmember banks seeking to establish a 
branch or relocate a main office or 
branch and for foreign banks seeking to 
relocate an insured branch (collectively, 
FDIC-supervised banks). The final rule 
also makes certain definitional 
clarifications to further improve 
regulatory efficiency and certainty. 
As discussed further in sections III.A 
and III.C of this 
SUPPLEMENTARY 
INFORMATION, the FDIC’s experience with 
branch filings has demonstrated that 
aspects of the filing process should be 
modified or eliminated. For example, 
through its supervisory programs, the 
FDIC has access to much of the 
information an applicant must provide 
under the existing regulation. In 
addition, branch filings are subject to a 
public comment process that is not 
mandated by statute, causes a 
meaningful delay in the amount of time 
to render a final decision, and typically 
does not yield information that 
materially aids the FDIC’s evaluation of 
the statutory factors pursuant to which 
these filings are considered. The FDIC 
also has found that branch filings 
generally present minimal supervisory 
concerns, particularly where a branch 
changes its physical address but 
remains in approximately the same 
location. 
Accordingly, the final rule accelerates 
expedited processing for institutions 
that satisfy certain criteria, removes 
select informational requirements, 
eliminates the public comment process, 
extends the expiration date for an 
approved filing, and excludes from the 
scope of filing requirements de minimis 
changes in address. The revisions in the 
final rule are expected to reduce the 
regulatory burden imposed on FDIC- 
supervised banks and the FDIC to 
complete the filing process. 
II. Background 
A. Statutory Requirements 
Section 18(d)(1) of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) requires 
the FDIC’s prior written consent for an 
insured State nonmember bank to 
establish and operate a new domestic 
branch or to move its main office or any 
domestic branch from one location to 
another.
1
This section also prohibits a 
foreign bank from moving an insured 
branch from one location to another 
without the FDIC’s prior written 
consent. 
When considering whether to grant or 
withhold such consent, the FDIC must 
consider the factors listed in section 6 
of the FDI Act (statutory factors). The 
statutory factors are as follows: (1) the 
financial history and condition of the 
depository institution; (2) the adequacy 
of the depository institution’s capital 
structure; (3) the future earnings 
prospects of the depository institution; 
(4) the general character and fitness of 
the management of the depository 
institution; (5) the risk presented by the 
depository institution to the Deposit 
Insurance Fund; (6) the convenience 
and needs of the community to be 
served by the depository institution; and 
(7) whether the depository institution’s 
corporate powers are consistent with the 
purposes of the FDI Act. In addition, 
when evaluating an application to 
establish a branch, relocate a branch, or 
relocate a main office, the Community 
Reinvestment Act (CRA) requires the 
FDIC to take into consideration the 
bank’s record of meeting the credit 
needs of its entire community, 
including low- and moderate-income 
neighborhoods, consistent with the safe 
and sound operation of the bank.
2
With 
respect to a bank establishing a de novo 
interstate branch that is not in the State 
nonmember bank’s home State and in 
which the bank does not already have 
a branch, the Riegle-Neal Interstate 
Banking and Branching Efficiency Act 
of 1994 (IBBEA),
3
as amended, imposes 
certain additional restrictions and 
requirements codified in sections 18(d) 
and 44 of the FDI Act. Section 38 of the 
FDI Act imposes additional 
requirements and restrictions on 
undercapitalized institutions seeking to 
establish a branch. 
B. FDIC Rules and Regulations 
Subpart C of 12 CFR part 303 of the 
FDIC Rules and Regulations (subpart C) 
implements section 18(d) of the FDI Act 
and sets forth the filing requirements 
and procedures for insured State 
nonmember banks to establish a branch,

relocate a branch or main office, and 
retain an existing branch after the 
interstate relocation of a main office. 
Subpart C requires all insured State 
nonmember banks to submit an 
application to the appropriate FDIC 
office prior to establishing a new 
branch, relocating a branch or a main 
office, or retaining a branch after the 
interstate relocation of a main office.
4
 
All applicants are required to submit the 
same information regardless of the type 
of proposed change and regardless of 
the bank’s supervisory history, except 
that, consistent with section 38 of the 
FDI Act, undercapitalized institutions 
must submit relatively more 
information. Further, the FDIC retains 
the right to request additional 
information to complete application 
processing.
5
 
The application processing timeline 
depends primarily upon whether the 
bank meets the definition of an ‘‘eligible 
depository institution.’’
6
An application 
submitted by an eligible depository 
institution is generally subject to 
expedited processing, and applications 
submitted by all other insured State 
nonmember banks are subject to 
standard processing.
7
The FDIC Rules 
and Regulations at 12 CFR part 303 (part 
303) define an ‘‘eligible depository 
institution’’ as a depository institution 
that meets the following criteria: (1) 
received an FDIC-assigned composite 
rating of 1 or 2 under the Uniform 
Financial Institutions Rating System 
(UFIRS) as a result of its most recent 
Federal or State examination; (2) 
received a satisfactory or better CRA 
rating from its primary Federal regulator 
at its most recent examination, if the 
depository institution is subject to 
examination under 12 CFR part 345; (3) 
received a compliance rating of 1 or 2 
from its primary Federal regulator at its 
most recent examination; (4) is well- 
capitalized, as defined in the 
appropriate capital regulation and 
guidance of the institution’s primary 
Federal regulator; and (5) is not subject 
to a cease and desist order, consent 
order, prompt corrective action 
directive, written agreement, 
memorandum of understanding, or 
other administrative agreement with its 
primary Federal regulator or chartering 
authority.
8
 
Under the current rule, the FDIC 
retains the right to move an application 
from expedited processing to standard 
processing when appropriate.
9
Absent 
such removal, an application processed 
under expedited processing is deemed 
approved the latest of (1) 21 days after 
the FDIC receives a substantially 
complete application, (2) 5 days after 
the public comment period expires, or 
(3) in the case of an interstate branch 
application that represents new entry 
into a State where the applicant does 
not maintain a branch, 5 days after the 
FDIC receives the requisite confirmation 
from the host State that its filing 
requirements have been satisfied. The 
FDIC must provide the applicant with 
written notification of the final action 
when the decision is rendered.
10
 
Subpart J of part 303 (subpart J) sets 
forth the procedures for an insured 
branch of a foreign bank seeking the 
FDIC’s consent to move from one 
location to another at 12 CFR 303.184. 
The requirements in subpart J largely 
mirror the requirements found in 
subpart C. 
C. Branch Application Statistics 
From 2015 to September 30, 2025, the 
FDIC received 7,043 branch 
applications: 5,366 applications to 
establish a branch, 489 to relocate a 
main office, 1,183 to relocate a branch, 
and 5 applications related to an insured 
branch of a foreign bank, for an average 
of 655 applications received per year. 
During this period, the FDIC approved 
an average of 624 branch applications 
annually (479 branch establishment 
applications, 102 branch relocation 
applications, and 43 main office 
relocation applications). On average, 
531 applications per year were 
approved under expedited processing 
(85 percent) and 92 were approved 
under standard processing (15 percent). 
From 2015 to September 30, 2025, the 
average time between the FDIC’s receipt 
of an application to establish a branch 
or relocate a branch or main office and 
the application being approved, denied, 
returned to the applicant, or withdrawn, 
was 25 days for applications subject to 
expedited processing and 70 days for 
applications subject to standard 
processing. 
D. Public Comments 
On July 18, 2025, the FDIC published 
in the Federal Register a notice of 
proposed rulemaking on the 
Establishment and Relocation of 
Branches and Offices (NPR).
11
The FDIC 
invited public comment on all aspects 
of the NPR. The comment period ended 
on September 16, 2025. The FDIC 
received 8 total comments from 7 
different individuals, financial 
institutions, industry groups, and 
consumer organizations. 
Several comments were supportive of 
the NPR. More specifically, several 
commenters supported the FDIC’s 
efforts to shorten filing processing 
timelines, simplify certain filing 
requirements, and eliminate 
unnecessary delays. Two of these 
commenters generally supported the 
elimination of public notice and 
comment requirements, and one of these 
commenters supported providing 
reasonable advance notice to customers 
for de minimis changes in address but requested clarification on what would 
constitute reasonable advance notice. 
Two commenters supported the 
proposed changes to expedited 
processing, with one of these 
commenters noting that the NPR would 
shorten expedited processing timelines 
and another of these commenters noting 
that the NPR would expand the number 
of eligible institutions. One commenter 
requested clarification on what would 
constitute a ‘‘substantially complete’’ 
filing and guidance on how the FDIC 
would determine an institution’s 
eligibility for expedited processing. 
One commenter expressed support for 
the proposed definitions. In particular, 
the commenter noted that clarification 
of terms, including ‘‘branch,’’ ‘‘remote 
service unit,’’ and ‘‘de minimis change 
in address,’’ will help to ensure 
consistent interpretation and 
application. One commenter requested 
clarification on several definitions, 
including examples of what features 
distinguish a remote service unit (RSU) 
from other service models and examples 
of what qualifies as an intrastate 
relocation. The commenter also 
requested that the FDIC clarify whether 
the same streamlined filing 
requirements apply to intrastate 
relocations of main offices. 
One commenter requested that the 
FDIC make an additional change to 12 
CFR 303.45(c) to extend the expiration 
date for an approved filing from 18 
months to 36 months. The commenter 
reasoned that preparations for a 
relocation generally take longer than the 
18 months provided by the current 
regulation, and a longer expiration 
period would enable institutions to seek 
regulatory approval earlier in the 
process. 
Several commenters opposed aspects 
of the NPR. Four commenters asserted 
that some of the proposed changes may 
be inconsistent with the CRA. 
Specifically, three of these commenters 
expressed concerns regarding the 
proposed elimination of the provisions

See 12 U.S.C. 1813(o). concerning public comments and public

opposed the elimination of public 
notice and filing requirements, and one 
of these commenters objected to the 
removal of local newspaper posting 
requirements. These commenters argued 
that, by eliminating public notice and 
comment processes, the FDIC would be 
unable to fulfill its obligations under the 
CRA with respect to branch filings. 
One commenter opposed the creation 
of a new definition for de minimis 
changes in address. The commenter 
asserted that the proposed exclusion of 
de minimis changes in address could 
have negative community impacts. 
Three commenters expressed 
concerns regarding the proposed 
changes to expedited processing. Two of 
these commenters expressed concerns 
regarding the proposed shortening of the 
filing approval period and the proposed 
elimination of the FDIC’s discretion to 
remove a filing from expedited 
processing. One of these commenters 
expressed concerns about making 
UFIRS 3-rated institutions eligible for 
expedited processing. The commenter 
reasoned that UFIRS 3-rated institutions 
are underperforming institutions and 
should not be permitted to receive ‘‘fast- 
tracked’’ approval under the proposed 
rule. Another of these commenters 
objected to the proposed eligibility of 
intrastate branch and main office 
relocation filings for expedited 
processing. 
III. Description of the Final Rule 
A. Rules of General Applicability 
1. Public Notice Requirements 
Public notice requirements under 
subpart A of 12 CFR part 303 of the 
FDIC Rules and Regulations (subpart A) 
generally apply to applications 
submitted under subpart C.
12
The NPR 
proposed to eliminate the public notice 
and related public comment period from 
subpart C and to make conforming 
changes to subpart A. Specifically, the 
FDIC proposed to strike the provisions 
in 12 CFR 303.7(a) and (c) that reference 
the establishment of a branch or a 
branch or main office relocation as 
being subject to the public notice 
requirements in subpart A. In addition, 
the FDIC proposed to make technical 
conforming changes to the CRA 
regulations in 12 CFR part 345, which 
cross reference the public notice 
provisions of subpart A. 
Three commenters generally 
supported the FDIC’s efforts to 
streamline subpart C filings, with two of 
these commenters specifically 
supporting the elimination of the public 
notice and comment period. Four 
commenters objected to the elimination 
of the public notice and related public 
comment period. 
Some commenters argued that the 
elimination would violate the CRA. As 
explained in the NPR, elimination of the 
public notice and related public 
comment period does not change the 
FDIC’s obligations under the CRA. The 
FDIC will continue to take into 
consideration a bank’s CRA rating.
13
An 
institution’s ability to qualify for 
expediting processing as an eligible 
depository institution depends on a 
satisfactory or better CRA rating. The 
FDIC does not propose to alter this 
element of the definition of eligible 
depository institution. Accordingly, 
eliminating the public notice and 
comment period does not impact the 
FDIC’s existing obligations under the 
CRA. 
Furthermore, as noted in the NPR, the 
FDIC expects that a bank will provide 
reasonable advance notice to customers 
affected by a branch or main office 
relocation. One commenter asked the 
FDIC to clarify the scope of this 
expectation and to provide additional 
details regarding compliance. As 
discussed in section III.E of this 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, the FDIC 
is adopting a regulatory customer 
notification obligation and includes 
additional details regarding compliance 
below. 
The FDIC is adopting the changes to 
12 CFR 303.7(a) and (c) as proposed. 
The FDIC will continue to comply with 
its obligations under the CRA, which 
does not require public notice or 
comment for branch establishments or 
branch and main office relocations. 
2. Hearings and Other Meetings 
Applications submitted under subpart 
C are generally subject to subpart A’s 
provisions concerning hearings and 
other meetings.
14
The NPR proposed to 
eliminate branch filings from the 
hearings and other meetings provisions 
in subpart A. Specifically, the FDIC 
proposed to strike the provisions in 12 
CFR 303.10(a) that reference the 
establishment of a branch or a branch or 
main office relocation because these 
public hearing provisions are not 
statutorily required. The NPR also 
explained that public hearings do not 
materially aid the FDIC’s consideration 
of the statutory factors when evaluating 
an application to establish a branch or 
to relocate a main office or branch. 
Three commenters objected to the 
elimination of branch filings from the 
hearings and other meetings provisions 
in subpart A. Two of these commenters 
urged that the small number of requests 
for hearings received and granted by the 
FDIC is not a justification for 
eliminating the right of the public to 
request hearings. One of these 
commenters claimed that the 
elimination of branch filings from the 
hearings and other meetings provisions 
in subpart A, coupled with the proposed 
reduction of filing processing timelines, 
would provide limited opportunity for 
community feedback. 
The FDIC is adopting the changes to 
12 CFR 303.10(a) as proposed. The FDI 
Act does not require the FDIC to hold 
public hearings for applications 
submitted under subpart C, and they 
have not materially aided the FDIC’s 
consideration of the statutory factors 
when evaluating an application to 
establish a branch or to relocate a main 
office or branch. 
B. Definitions 
1. Branch 
The FDIC is revising the definition of 
‘‘branch’’ at 12 CFR 303.41(a) to clarify 
that a branch does not include an RSU 
to reflect the FDI Act’s statutory 
exclusion of RSUs from the definition of 
‘‘domestic branch.’’
15
One commenter 
supported the proposed definition for 
the term ‘‘branch’’ with this 
clarification. No commenters opposed 
the proposed definition of ‘‘branch.’’ 
The FDIC is adopting the change as 
proposed. 
2. Branch Relocation 
The FDIC is establishing a rule of 
construction within the definition of 
‘‘branch relocation’’ at 12 CFR 303.41(b) 
in the final rule to provide that a branch 
relocation does not include a de 
minimis change in address. The rule of construction defines a ‘‘de minimis 
change in address’’ as occurring when a 
branch exchanges one physical facility 
for another within the same 
approximate location, such as where (1) 
a direct line of sight exists between the 
two facilities, (2) the facilities share the 
same parking area, or (3) the facilities 
are located on contiguous properties or 
on the same block. 
The FDIC has found that in some 
situations a change in facility may be in 
a bank’s best interest for a business, 
operational, or other reason outside the 
control of a bank, such as the same 
landlord expanding a shopping center 
and offering more advantageous lease

letters/2024/classification-interactive-teller- 
machines-domestic. 
terms for the exchange of one suite in 
the shopping center for another. Such 
changes are often time-sensitive due to 
external circumstances. In the FDIC’s 
experience, the exchange of one 
physical facility for another that results 
in such a de minimis change in address 
is not appropriately contemplated under 
the filing requirements of subpart C. The 
final rule recognizes the absence of a 
significant supervisory purpose to 
processing filings for such de minimis 
changes in address by removing the 
requirement to submit a filing for such 
changes. 
Although a de minimis change in 
address is not subject to the 
requirements in 12 CFR 303.42 through 
303.44, the final rule requires a bank 
undertaking a de minimis change in 
address to provide reasonable advance 
written notice to customers of the 
branch undergoing a de minimis change 
in address and the appropriate FDIC 
office. 
Several commenters supported the 
exclusion of de minimis changes in 
address from filing requirements. One 
commenter noted that the clarification 
of key terms like ‘‘de minimis change in 
address’’ will help ensure consistent 
interpretation and application of filing 
requirements. Another commenter 
opposed the proposal to exclude de 
minimis changes in address from filing requirements. The commenter reasoned 
that, by ‘‘fast-tracking’’ these filings, the 
FDIC would be unable to gather enough 
information to assess potential 
community impacts resulting from de 
minimis changes in address. For example, the commenter hypothesized 
that a de minimis change in address 
could result in the closing of a street 
level branch in favor of a new branch in 
a high rise building that is less 
accessible to customers. 
The FDIC is adopting 12 CFR 
303.41(b) as proposed. The FDIC has 
retained the definition of de minimis 
change in address and the 
corresponding exception from filing 
requirements because the expected 
reductions in regulatory burden and 
cost for both banks and the FDIC 
outweigh the potential risks. The 
purpose of the exception is to allow a 
bank to move to a nearby facility when 
it is in its best interest for a business, 
operational, or other reason outside the 
control of a bank, and therefore the 
FDIC does not expect that FDIC- 
supervised banks would utilize the de 
minimis change in address exception to move to a branch that would be more 
difficult for its customers to access. 
3. De Novo Interstate Branch 
The FDIC is replacing the term ‘‘de 
novo branch’’ with ‘‘de novo interstate 
branch’’ in subpart C. The term ‘‘de 
novo branch’’ is defined in section 
18(d)(4)(C) of the FDI Act within the 
more narrow context of interstate 
branching. However, the current 
definition of ‘‘de novo branch’’ in 
subpart C does not account for the 
interstate context of the statutory 
definition. The FDIC is revising 12 CFR 
303.41(c) to change the defined term to 
‘‘de novo interstate branch’’ and 
updating the definition to indicate that 
it is a branch of a bank that is 
established by the bank as a branch in 
a State other than the bank’s home State 
or one in which the bank does not 
maintain a branch, and does not become 
a branch of such bank as a result of (1) 
the acquisition by the bank of an 
insured depository institution or a 
branch of an insured depository 
institution, or (2) the conversion, 
merger, or consolidation of any such 
institution or branch. 
The final rule makes conforming 
changes to account for the new defined 
term by replacing ‘‘de novo branch’’ 
with ‘‘de novo interstate branch’’ where 
it is used in subpart C. Under the final 
rule, this defined term is only relevant 
to ensure that a filing for a de novo 
interstate branch will be deemed 
approved only after relevant host State 
filing requirements have been satisfied. 
The FDIC did not receive any comments 
regarding these conforming changes. 
4. Remote Service Unit 
The FDIC is defining the term ‘‘remote 
service unit’’ in subpart C at 12 CFR 
303.41(g). Section 3(o) of the FDI Act 
excludes automated teller machines 
(ATMs) and RSUs from the definition of 
‘‘domestic branch’’ but does not define 
either term.
16
The final rule adopts a 
definition of RSU that aligns the FDIC 
Rules and Regulations with the 
regulations of the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).
17
 
The final rule defines ‘‘remote service 
unit’’ as an automated or unstaffed 
facility, operated by a customer of a 
bank with at most delimited assistance 
from bank personnel, that conducts 
banking functions such as receiving 
deposits, paying withdrawals, or 
lending money. 
An RSU includes an ATM, automated 
loan machine, automated device for 
receiving deposits, personal computer, 
telephone, other similar electronic 
devices, and drop boxes. An RSU may 
be equipped with a telephone or tele- 
video device that allows contact with 
bank personnel. The final rule excludes 
a drop box from the definition of 
‘‘branch’’ by including a drop box in the 
definition of ‘‘remote service unit’’ to 
avoid the incongruous result where the 
definition of ‘‘branch’’ encompasses a 
drop box but not an ATM.
18
 
The FDIC’s definition of an RSU is 
intended to accommodate most facilities 
commonly referred to as ‘‘interactive 
teller machines’’ (ITMs). In 2024, the 
FDIC issued a Financial Institution 
Letter stating that an ITM would qualify 
for the RSU exclusion, and thus would 
not be a branch, under the following 
circumstances: (1) the ITM is an 
automated, unstaffed banking facility 
owned or operated by, or operated 
exclusively for, the bank, which is 
equipped to enable existing customers 
to initiate an interactive session with 
remotely located bank personnel; and, 
(2) to the extent that bank personnel 
have the ability to remotely assist the 
customer with the operation of the ITM 
to perform core banking functions, 
customers must also be able to perform 
such transactions without the 
involvement of bank personnel and 
must have the sole discretion to initiate 
and terminate interactive sessions with 
bank personnel.
19
As part of the 
proposal, the FDIC sought comment on 
whether those criteria should be 
retained or modified. 
One commenter supported the 
exclusion of RSUs from the definition of 
‘‘branch,’’ but suggested that the FDIC 
provide examples or frequently asked 
questions (FAQs) to help banks 
distinguish RSUs from other types of 
staffed service channels. The 
commenter noted that, as technology 
evolves, the line between RSUs and 
other staffed service channels may 
become less clear. The FDIC recognizes 
that technological advancements can 
make it difficult to assess what may 
distinguish an RSU from other staffed 
service channels. The FDIC intends to 
provide the industry with flexibility as 
innovations drive new methods of 
serving customers in a rapidly evolving 
technology landscape, and the agency 
may issue additional guidance based on 
future technological advancements at a

12 U.S.C. 1828(d)(1) includes a cross-reference 
to 12 U.S.C. 1816, which outlines the relevant 
statutory factors that the FDIC must consider in 
connection with a branch application. 
21
12 CFR 303.43(a). 
22
Filings involving a de novo interstate branch 
typically involve a lengthier approval timeline 
because they are subject to additional statutory 
requirements. See 12 U.S.C. 1828(d)(4)(B). Specifically, the bank must comply with State filing 
requirements, satisfy concentration limits, be 
adequately capitalized, and be well capitalized and 
well managed upon establishment of the branch. 
See 12 U.S.C. 1831u(b)(1), (3), and (4). 23
12 CFR 303.2(r). 
24
12 CFR 369.5 implements 12 U.S.C. 1835a, 
which provides that an out-of-State bank may not 
open a new interstate branch in the host State 
unless the bank provides reasonable assurances to 
the satisfaction of the FDIC that the bank will 
reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the 
community that the new branch will serve. 
Accordingly, expedited processing would be 
inappropriate for filers subject to sanctions under 
12 CFR 369.5. 
25
12 CFR 303.43(a) (providing the criteria that an 
institution must satisfy to qualify as an ‘‘eligible 
depository institution’’). 
C. Filing Procedures 
1. General 
The NPR proposed eliminating the 
timing requirement for the submission 
of a subpart C filing. Regulations at 12 
CFR 303.42(a) currently require 
applicants to submit an application to 
the appropriate FDIC office on the date 
the bank’s required newspaper notice is 
published or within 5 days after the date 
of the last required newspaper 
publication. The FDIC proposed 
eliminating the timing requirement 
because it is tied to the newspaper 
publication requirement, which the NPR 
also eliminated. The FDIC did not 
receive comments regarding this 
proposed change. The FDIC is adopting 
the revisions to 12 CFR 303.42(a) as 
proposed. 
2. Content of Filing 
The NPR proposed to streamline the 
information required to be included 
with a branch filing under 12 CFR 
303.42(b). The FDIC explained that 
through its routine examination and 
supervisory processes, it maintains 
sufficient information to consider the 
statutory factors without requiring a 
bank to compile and submit all the 
information currently required by 
subpart C. 
The FDIC asked commenters for 
feedback on whether the proposed filing 
content requirements are appropriate to 
garner sufficient information for the 
FDIC to evaluate the statutory factors in 
the context of a branch establishment or 
a branch or main office relocation. Two 
commenters supported the proposed 
streamlining of filing content, noting 
that the result would reduce cost and 
regulatory burden for applicants. One 
commenter, however, noted that the 
sixth statutory factor under section 
18(d)(1) of the FDI Act requires the FDIC 
to consider ‘‘the convenience and needs 
of the community to be served,’’
20
and 
argued that the elimination of public 
notice, comment, and hearing 
procedures would prevent the FDIC 
from appropriately considering that 
factor. One commenter requested 
clarification regarding whether the 
proposed streamlined filing content 
requirements apply to intrastate main 
office relocations. 
The FDIC is adopting the revisions to 
12 CFR 303.42(b) as proposed. The FDIC 
reiterates that it maintains sufficient 
information to consider the statutory 
factors without requiring a bank to 
compile and submit all of the 
information currently required by 12 
CFR 303.42(b). Moreover, the FDIC is 
satisfied that it can obtain additional 
information necessary to analyze a 
branch establishment or a branch or 
main office relocation in accordance 
with the statutory factors, 
notwithstanding the streamlined 
content filing requirements in the final 
rule. In addition, the FDIC notes that the 
filing content requirements under 12 
CFR 303.42 apply to all subpart C 
filings, which include intrastate main 
office relocations. 
D. Processing 
1. Expedited Processing for Eligible 
Depository Institutions 
The NPR proposed to shorten the 
approval period for expedited 
processing for eligible depository 
institutions and eliminate the FDIC’s 
discretion to remove a filing from 
expedited processing in 12 CFR 
303.43(a). An application processed 
under expedited processing is currently 
deemed approved on the latest of the 
following: (1) 21 days after receipt by 
the FDIC of a substantially complete 
application; (2) 5 days after expiration 
of the comment period described in 12 
CFR 303.44; or (3) in the case of an 
application to establish a de novo 
branch in a State that is not the 
applicant’s home State and in which the 
applicant does not maintain a branch, 5 
days after the FDIC receives 
confirmation from the host State that the 
applicant has both complied with the 
filing requirements of the host State and 
submitted a copy of the application with 
the FDIC to the host State bank 
supervisor.
21
 
The NPR proposed that a filing 
submitted by an eligible depository 
institution that is processed under 
expedited processing would be deemed 
approved on the later of the following: 
(1) the third business day after receipt 
by the FDIC of a substantially complete 
filing; or (2) in the case of a filing to 
establish and operate a de novo 
interstate branch in a State that is not 
the applicant’s home State and in which 
the applicant does not maintain a 
branch, the fifth day after the FDIC 
receives confirmation from the host 
State that the applicant has both 
complied with the filing requirements of 
the host State and submitted a copy of 
the filing with the FDIC to the host State 
bank supervisor.
22
The FDIC proposed 
to retain the definition of ‘‘eligible 
depository institution.’’
23
The final rule 
reflects the statutory prohibition against 
interstate deposit production offices by 
clarifying that a filing will not receive 
expedited processing if the filer is 
subject to sanctions under 12 CFR 
369.5.
24
 
Some commenters expressed concern 
that the abbreviated approval period 
would not provide the FDIC with 
sufficient time to conduct a meaningful 
review of a subpart C filing. As 
explained in the NPR, the FDIC 
determined that qualification as an 
eligible depository institution,
25
in 
tandem with the relative immateriality 
of a branch establishment or relocation, 
enables the FDIC to conclude that a 
proposed branch establishment or 
relocation satisfies the statutory factors. 
The FDIC continues to believe the 
proposed approval timelines are 
appropriate to enhance the speed and 
certainty of filings and is therefore 
adopting those timelines as proposed. 
One commenter encouraged the FDIC 
to explain how eligibility for expedited 
processing would be determined in 
practice. The FDIC notes that this would 
entail confirming that the institution 
meets the definition of ‘‘eligible 
depository institution’’ based on 
existing supervisory information. 
The FDIC currently retains discretion 
to remove a filing from expedited 
processing for any reason described in 
12 CFR 303.11(c)(2). Under the NPR, a 
subpart C filing from an eligible 
depository institution that satisfies the 
criteria for expedited processing would 
be deemed approved in accordance with 
the statutory factors, and the FDIC 
would not have discretion to remove the 
filing from expedited processing. The 
FDIC rarely exercised discretion to 
remove a subpart C filing from 
expedited processing and the proposed 
change would provide more certainty to 
filers who satisfy the expedited 
processing criteria. 
One commenter supported the 
proposal to eliminate the FDIC’s 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:12 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\29DER1.SGM 29DER1

29, 1999). 
discretion to remove a filing from 
expedited review, noting that the 
change would provide greater certainty 
to filers and reduce delays. However, 
this commenter requested clarification 
on what constitutes a ‘‘substantially 
complete’’ filing, such that the 
expedited timeline would begin. Given 
that branch filings will not be 
information-intensive or require 
iterative information requests, rather 
than define ‘‘substantially complete’’ for 
the purposes of branch filings, the final 
rule deems a filing eligible for expedited 
processing (other than a de novo 
interstate branch) to be approved on the 
third business day after the FDIC 
receives a letter filing that includes the 
information set forth in 12 CFR 303.42. 
Two commenters expressed concern 
that the FDIC would be unable to 
appropriately exercise its supervisory 
authority if its discretion to remove a 
filing from expedited processing was 
eliminated. The FDIC believes that the 
goal of providing more certainty to filers 
who satisfy the criteria for expedited 
processing supports elimination of its 
rarely exercised discretion to remove a 
filing from expedited processing. 
Accordingly, the final rule is adopted as 
proposed, with modifications. These 
modifications include eliminating the 
reference to a ‘‘substantially complete’’ 
application and clarifying that a filing 
will be processed under expedited 
processing if the informational 
requirements of 12 CFR 303.42 are 
satisfied. Furthermore, a modification to 
12 CFR 303.43 clarifies that filers 
subject to sanctions under 12 CFR 369.5 
are ineligible for expedited processing. 
2. Expedited Processing for Branch 
Relocations and Main Office Relocations 
The NPR proposed to revise 12 CFR 
303.43(b) to establish a new category of 
expedited processing for intrastate 
branch and main office relocation filings 
submitted by a bank that received an 
FDIC-assigned composite UFIRS rating 
of 3 or better as a result of its most 
recent Federal or State examination. 
Expedited processing would apply to 
intrastate branch and main office 
relocation filings by institutions rated 3 
or better under 12 CFR 303.43(b) 
regardless of whether the institution 
satisfied the other criteria in 12 CFR 
303.2(r) for an eligible depository 
institution. 
Section 303.41(b) defines a ‘‘branch 
relocation’’ narrowly as a move within 
the same immediate neighborhood of 
the existing branch that does not 
substantially affect the nature of the 
business of the branch or the customers 
of the branch.
26
This definition also 
specifies that moving a branch to a 
location outside its immediate 
neighborhood is considered the closing 
of an existing branch and the 
establishment of a new branch. A main 
office relocation, while not defined, 
would not be expansionary in nature 
regardless of the distance involved, 
because the bank may only have a single 
main office. For these reasons, a branch 
or main office relocation typically 
presents a limited set of facts and 
circumstances for review and 
consideration of the statutory factors. 
One commenter recommended the 
FDIC provide examples of what 
qualifies as an intrastate main office 
relocation. To promote clarity, the final 
rule adopts a definition of an ‘‘intrastate 
main office relocation’’ to be the 
relocation of a main office of a bank 
within the same State such that there is 
no change in the bank’s home State. 
One commenter objected to 
expanding expedited processing for 
intrastate branch and main office 
relocations so as to include banks that 
received an FDIC-assigned composite 
rating of 3 or better under the UFIRS. 
The commenter characterized these 
banks as ‘‘underperforming’’ and argued 
that offering expedited processing to 
these banks would disincentivize them 
from correcting deficiencies. The final 
rule retains expedited processing for 
intrastate branch and main office 
relocations because, as discussed above, 
these relocations are non-expansionary 
in nature. The FDIC notes that, under 
the final rule, expedited processing for 
branch establishments, as opposed to 
relocations, remains limited to eligible 
depository institutions. 
Other commenters expressed concern 
that the FDIC would not have discretion 
to remove an intrastate branch or main 
office relocation filing submitted by a 
bank with a composite rating of 3 or 
better from expedited processing. As 
discussed above, expedited processing 
for these non-expansionary filings by 
banks with a composite rating of 3 or 
better would promote the FDIC’s goal of 
providing more certainty and clarity 
regarding processing. The final rule 
adopts the provisions of 12 CFR 
303.43(b) as proposed. 
3. FDIC Internal Processes 
The NPR noted the FDIC was 
evaluating and updating its internal 
processes to further streamline and 
expedite the review and consideration 
of filings submitted under subpart C. 
One commenter recommended that the 
FDIC confirm that acknowledgement 
letters will clearly state when the 
expedited timeline begins and asked the 
FDIC to clarify how eligibility for 
expedited processing will be 
determined in practice. The FDIC 
intends to take these recommendations 
into account as it continues to update its 
internal processes and related publicly 
available materials to reflect the 
provisions of the final rule and 
comments received on the NPR. 
E. Public Notice Requirements 
The NPR proposed to eliminate the 
newspaper publication requirement in 
12 CFR 303.44(a) and related provisions. 
One commenter urged the FDIC to 
maintain the newspaper publication 
requirement. The commenter reasoned 
that newspaper media outlets continue 
to play a role in educating the public. 
However, the NPR also noted the FDIC’s 
expectation that banks seeking to 
relocate a branch or main office provide 
reasonable advance notice to customers 
and the appropriate FDIC office. The 
FDIC believes that this will accomplish 
the underlying goal of ensuring that 
customers are aware of proposed branch 
and main office relocations and able to 
conveniently access banking services. 
One commenter requested that the 
FDIC provide clear guidance on what 
constitutes reasonable advanced notice 
to customers. The FDIC intends to 
provide the industry with flexibility in 
determining how to best provide 
reasonable advance notice to customers. 
An applicant can choose the best 
method or methods of communicating a 
proposed branch or main office 
relocation with its affected customer 
base. Although the requirements of 
section 42 of the FDI Act do not apply 
to relocations, the type of notice 
provided in such contexts, such as a 
notice in a regular account statement, 
would necessarily be considered 
reasonable advance notice.
27
The final 
rule eliminates this provision of 12 CFR 
303.44(a) as proposed, and, like the 
NPR, would continue to require 
confirmation of advance customer 
notice as part of a branch or main office 
relocation, and would require such 
notice in connection with a de minimis 
change in address. Specifically, the final 
rule adopts the provision proposed in 
the NPR that would make confirmation 
of advance written notice to customers 
part of the information requirements for 
a branch or main office relocation filing. 
With respect to a de minimis changes in 
address, the final rule adopts the 
provision proposed in the NPR that

30
Although the final rule will result in a decrease 
in the burden for a branch application, the FDIC 
does not believe the final rule will likely result in 
a material increase in the number of branch 
applications. To the extent that the final rule results 
in a greater number of branch applications, the 
historical average of 655 branch applications per 
year may be an undercount of the number of 
applications affected by the final rule. The FDIC 
believes that using 700 as the number of branch 
applications per year is a conservative estimate for 
purposes of estimating the effects of the final rule.

Final 12 CFR 303.41(b).

Based on Paperwork Reduction Act hourly 
burden estimates for branch applications by State 
nonmember banks under Information Collection 
Request OMB No. 3064–0070 (See https://
www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAICList?ref_
nbr=202301-3064-006). Hourly burden estimates for 
branch applications by foreign banks under 
Information Collection Request OMB No. 3064– 
0114 are not used for this analysis because only 5 
out of 7,043 historical branch applications were 
submitted by a foreign bank. 
33
In recent information collection requests, the 
FDIC estimated that the fully loaded costs of 
preparing and submitting branch applications are 
approximately $147 per hour for State nonmember 
banks and $135 per hour for foreign banks. See 
https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/ 
PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202312-3064-001, respectively.

De minimis changes in address will only 
involve relocations ‘‘within the same approximate

35
$30,000 savings annually = $1,000 per 
relocation application × 30 applications per year; and 30 branch applications per year = 325 
applications/10.75 years (rounded to the nearest 
integer). 
36
See section VI.A of this SUPPLEMENTARY 
INFORMATION. 
37
In recent information collection requests, the 
FDIC estimated that the fully loaded costs of 
preparing and submitting branch applications are 
approximately $147 per hour for State nonmember 
banks and $135 per hour for foreign banks. See https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/ 
PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202312-3064-001, respectively. 
38
$268,000 cost savings per year = 670 branch 
applications per year * 2 hours saved per 
application * $200 per hour saved. 
39
As noted above, intrastate branch filings are 
deemed approved under expedited processing on 
the latest of: the 21st day after receipt by the FDIC 
of a substantially complete filing, or the fifth day 
after expiration of the comment period described in 
Continued 
requires reasonable advance written 
notice to customers of a branch 
undergoing a de minimis change in 
address. 
F. Expiration of Approval 
One commenter requested that the 
FDIC extend the expiration date for an 
approved filing under 12 CFR 303.45(c) 
from 18 months to 36 months. The 
commenter reasoned that preparations 
for a relocation generally take longer 
than the 18 months provided by the 
current regulation, and a longer 
expiration period would enable banks to 
seek regulatory approval earlier in the 
process. In the final rule, the FDIC 
modifies 12 CFR 303.45(c) to extend the 
expiration date for an approved filing to 
24 months. The final rule adopts this 
24-month expiration period, as it is the 
FDIC’s expectation that 24 months 
would provide a reasonable timeframe 
for banks to consummate a branch 
establishment or relocation. 
G. Moving an Insured Branch of a 
Foreign Bank 
The NPR proposed making changes to 
subpart J to correspond to those 
proposed for subpart C. The FDIC did 
not receive comments on its proposed 
revisions to subpart J. The final rule 
adopts the previously proposed changes 
to subpart J to correspond with the 
changes to subpart C discussed in this 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. 
IV. Expected Effects 
As previously discussed, the objective 
of the final rule is to improve the speed 
and certainty of, and reduce the 
regulatory burden associated with, the 
filing process for insured State 
nonmember banks seeking to establish a 
branch or relocate a main office or 
branch and for foreign banks seeking to 
relocate an insured branch (collectively, 
FDIC-supervised banks). 
This analysis utilizes all regulations 
and guidance applicable to FDIC- 
supervised banks, as well as information 
on their financial condition as of the 
quarter ending June 30, 2025, as the 
baseline to which the effects of the final 
rule are estimated. 
The final rule applies to FDIC- 
supervised banks seeking to establish a 
branch, relocate a main office or branch, 
or relocate an insured branch of a 
foreign bank. As of the quarter ending 
June 30, 2025, the FDIC supervises 
2,776 State nonmember banks or 
insured branches of foreign banks which 
collectively operate 25,250 branches 
and main offices.
28
In the period from 
January 1, 2015 to September 30, 2025, 
the FDIC received 7,043 branch 
applications: 5,366 applications to 
establish a branch, 489 to relocate a 
main office, 1,183 to relocate a branch, 
and 5 applications relating to an insured 
branch of a foreign bank, for an average 
of 655 applications received per year.
29
 
Based on this historical average, the 
FDIC estimates that the final rule will 
affect approximately 700 branch filings 
per year on average.
30
 
The final rule reduces the regulatory 
requirements for branch filings. 
Specifically, it only requires FDIC- 
supervised banks that seek to make a de 
minimis change in the address of a branch to notify the FDIC and customers 
of the branch undergoing such a 
change,
31
rather than submit a filing. 
For all other branch filings, the final 
rule reduces filing content requirements 
from six to four items. The final rule 
also greatly reduces public notice 
requirements for filings and extends the 
expiration date for an approved filing 
from 18 months to 24 months. 
For FDIC-supervised banks that seek a 
de minimis change in address, the FDIC 
estimates that the final rule will 
eliminate the entire estimated five-hour 
burden of preparing and submitting a 
branch filing.
32
At a conservative 
estimate of $200 per hour per 
application,
33
the resulting savings will 
be $1,000 per de minimis change in 
address. For the purpose of estimating 
the number of de minimis changes in 
address per year, the FDIC assumes that 
the distances of such relocations will be 
less than 0.1 miles.
34
Of the 7,043 
branch applications used in this 
analysis, 325 involved a relocation 
distance of less than 0.1 miles. As such, 
the FDIC estimates that approximately 
30 branch applications per year will 
involve a de minimis change in address, 
resulting in an estimated aggregate 
benefit of $30,000 annually.
35
 
For the remaining 670 branch 
applications that do not involve de 
minimis changes in address, the final rule will reduce the regulatory 
requirements for preparing and 
submitting branch filings. Specifically, 
it reduces filing content requirements 
from six to four items. The final rule 
also eliminates public notice 
requirements for these filings. The FDIC 
estimates these changes will benefit 
filers by reducing the time spent 
preparing and submitting branch filings 
by approximately two hours, on 
average.
36
At a conservative hourly 
burden estimate of $200 per hour,
37
the 
final rule will result in aggregate cost 
savings of approximately $268,000 per 
year.
38
 
Summing up the quantified effects for 
the approximately 700 affected branch 
applications, the FDIC estimates that the 
final rule will result in approximately 
$298,000 in savings per year from the 
reduction of labor costs associated with 
preparing and submitting branch filings. 
As previously discussed, the final rule 
will generally reduce the time it takes 
for the FDIC to process a filing. In 
particular, the final rule will establish a 
deadline of three days for approval after 
receipt of a letter filing that includes the 
information set forth in 12 CFR 303.42; 
a reduction of between 18 days and 28 
days, respectively.
39

(consisting of 8 days to meet the newspaper 
publication requirement plus a 15-day comment 
period), and 5 + 23 = 28. The final rule’s deadline 
of three days (down from 21) for intrastate branch 
filings represents a decrease of 18 days from 
baseline, and the elimination of the public notice 
requirements and associated five-day processing 
period represents a decrease of 28 days from 
baseline.

rule will expand expedited processing 
for intrastate branch filings and main 
office relocations to a bank that received 
an FDIC-assigned composite rating of 3 
or better under the UFIRS as a result of 
its most recent Federal or State 
examination. The final rule also extends 
the expiration date of an approved filing 
from 18 months to 24 months. Finally, 
the final rule will eliminate the FDIC’s 
discretion to remove a filing from 
expedited processing. As noted above, a 
filing to establish a branch, or to 
relocate a branch or main office, subject 
to expedited processing takes an average 
of 25 days to process.
40
 
The final rule’s reduction in 
processing times for certain branch 
filings will have benefits for eligible 
depository institutions. Faster 
processing times will reduce 
uncertainty and costs associated with 
downtime while waiting for a decision 
from the FDIC. FDIC-supervised banks 
will be able to more swiftly respond to 
changes in local conditions that affect 
their branch network, such as a change 
in landlord for a bank’s current location 
or a time-sensitive opportunity to 
relocate to a more desirable location. 
The FDIC does not have the information 
necessary to further quantify the 
benefits associated with the reduction in 
the time it takes for the FDIC to process 
filings, but believes that processing time 
reductions will improve productivity 
and competitiveness for applicants. 
As previously discussed, the final rule 
clarifies certain definitions. Specifically, 
the final rule clarifies that the term 
‘‘branch’’ does not include RSUs or drop 
boxes. In practice, the FDIC has not 
considered such locations branches. 
Finally, the final rule clarifies the 
definition of ‘‘de novo interstate 
branch.’’ The FDIC does not have the 
information necessary to quantify the 
benefits to prospective filers associated 
with these aspects of the final rule. 
However, the FDIC believes that these 
clarifications will benefit filers and the 
industry by reducing uncertainty. 
As previously discussed, the FDIC 
does not believe that the final rule will 
pose any material direct costs to filers. 
The FDIC acknowledges that there may 
be ancillary costs to the public. For 
example, the elimination of the public 
notice and comment requirements for 
branch establishments and branch and 
main office relocations may have 
impacts that are difficult to quantify.
41
 
The final rule eliminates any potential 
customer confusion by requiring 
confirmation of advance written notice 
to customers of a relocating branch or 
office as part of the filing information 
requirements. The FDIC does not have 
the data necessary to quantify the effect 
of the elimination of the public notice 
and comment requirements. However, 
given the limited historical number of 
public comments received in response 
to subpart C applications, and the 
advance notice provision, the FDIC does 
not believe this effect to be material. 
Moreover, the final rule does not affect 
the responsibility of FDIC-supervised 
banks to help meet the credit needs of 
the communities in which they are 
headquartered or operate branches. 
Therefore, the FDIC believes that the 
final rule will pose no substantiative 
indirect costs to customers. 
Finally, the FDIC believes that the 
final rule can provide indirect benefits 
to customers. To the extent that the 
shorter processing periods, reduced 
filing content requirements, and 
clarifications within the final rule 
reduce the time it takes banks to 
establish new branches and begin 
providing banking products and 
services at applicable locations, 
customers may benefit. The FDIC does 
not have the necessary information to 
quantify such benefits. 
V. Other Alternatives Considered 
The FDIC considered implementing 
internal process changes related to the 
review of subpart C filings that would 
result in abbreviated review periods 
without implementing a regulatory 
change. However, the FDIC determined 
that improving the speed, certainty, and 
regulatory burden associated with the 
processes for subpart C filings would be 
better achieved through a formal notice 
and comment rulemaking that 
considered feedback from all 
stakeholders.
42
As discussed above, the 
FDIC also expects to implement changes 
to its internal processes and related 
publicly available materials addressing 
subpart C filings consistent with the 
amendments set forth in this final rule 
to further support these objectives. 
VI. Regulatory Analysis 
A. Administrative Procedure Act 
The Administrative Procedure Act 
requires an agency to publish a 
substantive rule not less than 30 days 
before its effective date, except when an 
agency otherwise publishes in the final 
rule good cause for providing for an 
earlier effective date.
43
Accordingly, the 
final rule is effective as of the date set 
forth above in this document under the 
DATESheading. 
B. The Paperwork Reduction Act 
Certain provisions of the final rule 
contain ‘‘collections of information’’ 
within the meaning of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995.
44
In 
accordance with the requirements of the 
PRA, the FDIC may not conduct or 
sponsor, and the respondent is not 
required to respond to, an information 
collection unless it displays a currently 
valid Office of Budget and Management 
(OMB) control number. The information 
collections contained in the final rule 
have been submitted to OMB for review 
and approval by the FDIC under section 
3507(d) of the PRA
45
and 5 CFR 1320.11 
of OMB’s implementing regulations.
46
 
The FDIC proposes to extend for three 
years, with revision, the following 
information collections: 
Title of Information Collection: 
Application for a Bank to Establish a 
Branch or Move its Main Office or 
Branch. 
OMB Control Number: 3064–0070. 
Respondents: Insured State nonmember banks. 
Current Actions: The final rule revises 
the currently-approved information 
collection as follows: 
Section 303.42, Application for a 
bank to establish a branch or move its 
main office or Branch. Pursuant to 
sections 13(f), 13(k), 18(d) and 44 of the 
FDI Act, insured State nonmember 
banks must obtain FDIC approval before 
establishing a branch, relocating a 
branch or main office, or retaining 
existing branches after the interstate 
relocation of the main office. This 
information collection represents the 
occasional reporting requirement 
associated with those banks’ 
applications for FDIC approval. The 
final rule will reduce reporting burden 
by eliminating the requirement that the 
applicant provide information regarding 
insider involvement in the proposed 
branch office, comments on changes in 
services offered or the effect the 
proposal may have on the applicant’s 
compliance with the CRA, and a copy 
of and information related to the 
required newspaper publication. As 
such, the FDIC estimates average time

The SBA defines a small banking organization 
as having $850 million or less in assets, where an 
organization’s ‘‘assets are determined by averaging 
the assets reported on its four quarterly financial 
statements for the preceding year.’’ See 13 CFR 121.201 (as amended by 87 FR 69118, effective Dec. 
19, 2022). In its determination, the ‘‘SBA counts the 
receipts, employees, or other measure of size of the 
concern whose size is at issue and all of its 
domestic and foreign affiliates.’’ See 13 CFR 121.103. Following these regulations, the FDIC uses 
an insured depository institution’s affiliated and 
acquired assets, averaged over the preceding four 
quarters, to determine whether the insured 
depository institution is ‘‘small’’ for the purposes of 
RFA. 
50
FDIC Call Report data, June 30, 2025. 
51
FDIC Call Report and Structure Data, June 30, 
2025. 
52
To estimate whether a bank was ‘‘small’’ for 
purposes of the RFA during the quarter ending 
September 30, 2025, the FDIC relied on banks’ 
status as of June 30, 2025, because bank holding 
company regulatory reports for the quarter ending 
September 30, 2025, were not available at the time 
this analysis was conducted. 
53
FDIC supervisory and Call Report data. For the 
purpose of these application counts, an FDIC- 
supervised bank is considered ‘‘small’’ for purposes 
of the RFA if it is identified in the FDIC’s data as 
‘‘small’’ as of the quarter-end in which it sent a 
relevant application to the FDIC, with the exception 
for the quarter ending September 30, 2025, 
described in the previous footnote. Note that no 
insured branches of foreign banks are considered 
‘‘small’’ for purposes of the RFA. 2,821 
applications/10.75 years = 262 applications per year 
(when rounded to the nearest integer). 
54
Although the final rule will result in a decrease 
in the burden imposed by a branch application, the 
FDIC does not believe the final rule will likely 
result in a material increase in the number of 
branch filings. To the extent that the final rule 
results in a greater number of branch filings from 
small banks, the historical average of 262 branch 
applications per year may be an undercount of the 
number of applications affected by the final rule. 
The FDIC believes that using 300 as the number of 
branch applications from small banks per year is a 
conservative estimate for purposes of the RFA. 
per response will be reduced from 5 
hours to 3 hours. However, to account 
for additional applications that may 
result from changes in the final rule as 
well as historical data since the most 
recent PRA renewal, the FDIC also 
estimates an increase in respondents 
from 436 to 700. Thus, the total 
estimated annual burden for OMB No. 
3064–0070 is 2,100 hours, a decrease of 
80 hours from the most recent PRA 
renewal.
47
 
Title of Information Collection: 
Foreign Banks. 
OMB Control Number: 3064–0114. 
Respondents: Insured branches of foreign banks. 
Current Actions: The final rule revises 
the currently-approved information 
collection as follows: 
The FDIC is removing the information 
collection ‘‘Section 303.184, Moving a 
Branch’’ from the ICR under the OMB 
Control No. 3064–0114 and including it 
in the ICR under OMB Control No. 
3064–0070. Under 12 CFR 303.183, 
insured branches of foreign banks 
seeking approval from the FDIC to move 
locations complete a substantially 
similar application as domestic banks 
seeking FDIC approval to move 
locations. To ensure consistent burden 
estimates between similar respondents 
completing similar applications, the 
FDIC will include burden estimates 
from the information collection 
‘‘Section 303.184, Moving a Branch’’ in 
the information collection ‘‘Application 
for a bank to establish a branch or move 
its main office or Branch.’’ Combining 
these two information collections does 
not affect the FDIC estimates of 
respondents for the information 
collection under OMB Control No. 
3064–0070 because historically the 
FDIC rarely receives applications to 
move insured branches from foreign 
banks. In the most recent PRA renewal 
for OMB Control No. 3064–0114, the 
FDIC used a placeholder of a single 
respondent to maintain the information 
collection. 
C. Congressional Review Act 
Pursuant to the Congressional Review 
Act, the OMB makes a determination 
regarding whether a final rule 
constitutes a ‘‘major rule,’’ defined in 
the Congressional Review Act as any 
rule that the Administrator of the Office 
of Information and Regulatory Affairs of 
the OMB finds has resulted in or is 
likely to result in (A) an annual effect 
on the economy of $100,000,000 or 
more; (B) a major increase in costs or 
prices for consumers, individual 
industries, Federal, State, or local 
government agencies or geographic 
regions; or (C) significant adverse effects 
on competition, employment, 
investment, productivity, innovation, or 
on the ability of United States-based 
enterprises to compete with foreign- 
based enterprises in domestic and 
export markets. If OMB determines a 
rule is ‘‘major,’’ the Congressional 
Review Act generally provides that the 
rule may not take effect until at least 60 
days following its publication. If a rule 
is not a ‘‘major rule,’’ it may take effect 
after the Federal agency submits to 
Congress a report required under the 
Congressional Review Act. 
OMB has determined the final rule is 
not a major rule under the 
Congressional Review Act. Accordingly, 
the FDIC will submit the report to 
Congress required by the Congressional 
Review Act and the final rule will 
become effective as set forth under the 
DATESheading of this document. 
D. The Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
generally requires an agency, in 
connection with a final rule, to prepare 
and make available for public comment 
a final regulatory flexibility analysis that 
describes the impact of the final rule on 
small entities.
48
However, a final 
regulatory flexibility analysis is not 
required if the agency certifies that the 
final rule will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. The Small 
Business Administration (SBA) has 
defined ‘‘small entities’’ to include 
banking organizations with total assets 
of less than or equal to $850 million.
49
 
Generally, the FDIC considers a 
significant economic impact to be a 
quantified effect in excess of 5 percent 
of total annual salaries and benefits or 
2.5 percent of total noninterest 
expenses. The FDIC believes that effects 
in excess of one or more of these 
thresholds typically represent 
significant economic impacts for FDIC- 
supervised banks. 
The final rule applies to certain FDIC- 
supervised banks seeking to establish a 
branch, relocate a main office or branch, 
or relocate an insured branch of a 
foreign bank. As of the quarter ending 
June 30, 2025, the FDIC supervised 
2,776 banks, of which 2,055 were 
considered ‘‘small’’ for the purposes of 
RFA.
50
These 2,055 small banks 
collectively operated 8,204 branches 
and main offices.
51
In the period from 
January 1, 2015 to September 30, 
2025,
52
small banks submitted 2,145 
applications to establish a branch, 368 
applications to relocate a branch, and 
308 applications to relocate a main 
office, for a total of 2,821 applications 
and an average of 262 applications per 
year.
53
Based on this historical average, 
the FDIC estimates the final rule will 
affect approximately 300 branch 
applications from small banks per year 
on average.
54
 
In general, the final rule will reduce 
the regulatory requirements for 
establishing or relocating a branch. 
Specifically, it will eliminate filing 
requirements for de minimis changes in 
address and reduce filing content 
requirements from six to four items for 
all other filings. The final rule will also 
eliminate or greatly reduce public notice 
requirements for all branch 
establishments and relocations, and 
extend the expiration date of an 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:12 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\29DER1.SGM 29DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60556 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations 55
A bank completing a de minimis change in 
address will still be required to provide reasonable 
advance notice to customers of the branch per final 
12 CFR 303.41(b). 
56
Based on a conservative hourly burden 
estimate of $200 per hour. In recent information 
collection requests, the FDIC estimated that the 
fully loaded costs of preparing and submitting 
branch applications are approximately $147 per 
hour for State nonmember banks and $135 per hour 
for foreign banks. See https://www.reginfo.gov/ 
public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202301-3064-006 and https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/ PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202312/-3064-/001, respectively. 
57
Details of the time to prepare and submit 
branch applications are provided in section VI.A., 
Paperwork Reduction Act, of this 
SUPPLEMENTARY 
INFORMATION. 
58
As noted above, intrastate branch filings are 
deemed approved under expedited processing on 
the latest of: the 21st day after receipt by the FDIC 
of a substantially complete filing, or the fifth day 
after expiration of the comment period described in 
12 CFR 303.44, which at most could be 23 days 
(consisting of 8 days to meet the newspaper 
publication requirement plus a 15-day comment 
period), and 5 + 23 = 28. The final rule’s deadline 
of three days (down from 21) for intrastate branch 
filings represents a decrease of 18 days from 
baseline, and the elimination of the public notice 
requirements and associated five-day processing 
period represents a decrease of 28 days from 
baseline. 
59
Based on applications received from January 1, 
2015, to September 30, 2025. 
approved filing from 18 months to 24 
months.
55
 
As discussed in the Expected Effects 
section of this 
SUPPLEMENTARY 
INFORMATION, the FDIC estimates that 
there will be upwards of 30 de minimis 
changes in address per year. Based on 
supervisory and Call Report data, the 
FDIC estimates that upwards of 10 de 
minimis changes in address will involve small banks. The final rule will reduce 
the burden for these de minimis changes 
in address by five hours, or $1,000, per 
relocation.
56
Based on Call Report data 
for the quarter ending June 30, 2025, a 
cost savings of $1,000 is in excess of 5 
percent of total annual salaries and 
benefits or 2.5 percent of total 
noninterest expenses for one small 
bank. 
For the remaining 290 branch 
applications from small banks that do 
not involve de minimis changes in 
address, the FDIC estimates the final 
rule will benefit small filers by reducing 
the time spent preparing and submitting 
branch filings by approximately two 
hours, on average, or $400 per 
application.
57
Based on Call Report data 
for the quarter ending June 30, 2025, a 
cost savings of $400 is in excess of 5 
percent of total annual salaries and 
benefits or 2.5 percent of total 
noninterest expenses for one small bank 
(the same small bank previously 
identified). 
Based on the quantified effects of the 
final rule described above, the FDIC 
estimates that the rule will not 
significantly affect more than one small 
bank. 
As discussed in the Expected Effects 
section of this Supplementary 
Information, the final rule will also 
reduce the time it takes for the FDIC to 
process a filing. In particular, the final 
rule will establish a deadline of three 
days for approval after receipt of a letter 
filing that includes the information set 
forth in 12 CFR 303.42; a reduction of 
between 18 days and 28 days, 
respectively.
58
Further, the final rule 
will expand expedited processing for 
intrastate branch filings and main office 
relocations to a bank that received an 
FDIC-assigned composite rating of 3 or 
better under the UFIRS as a result of its 
most recent Federal or State 
examination. Finally, the final rule will 
eliminate the FDIC’s discretion to 
remove a filing from expedited 
processing. As mentioned above, a filing 
to establish a branch, or to relocate a 
branch or main office, subject to 
expedited processing takes an average of 
25 days to process.
59
 
The final rule’s reduction in 
processing times for certain branch 
filings will have benefits for eligible 
small depository institutions. Faster 
processing times will reduce the period 
of uncertainty for filers and reduce costs 
associated with downtime while waiting 
for a decision from the FDIC. Banks will 
be able to more swiftly respond to 
changes in local conditions, such as a 
change in landlord for a bank’s current 
location or a time-sensitive opportunity 
to relocate to a more desirable location. 
The FDIC does not have the information 
necessary to further quantify the benefit 
associated with the reduction in the 
time it takes for the FDIC to process 
filings, but believes that processing time 
reductions will improve productivity 
and competitiveness for filers. 
As mentioned above, the final rule 
extends the expiration date of an 
approved filing from 18 months to 24 
months, lengthening the period of time 
an affected bank has to complete a 
branch relocation or establish a branch. 
This aspect of the final rule will benefit 
small applicants by providing greater 
flexibility for the planning and 
execution of the establishment or 
relocation of a branch or office. The 
FDIC does not have the information 
necessary to identify which small, FDIC- 
supervised institutions will utilize the 
additional time in future periods. 
As previously discussed, the final rule 
clarifies certain definitions. Specifically, 
the final rule clarifies that ‘‘branch’’ 
does not include RSUs, drop boxes, or 
financial education programs that 
include the provision of bank products 
and services. In practice the FDIC has 
not considered such locations branches. 
Finally, the final rule clarifies the 
definition of ‘‘de novo interstate 
branch’’ for the purposes of the filings 
requirements for establishing a branch, 
relocating a main office or branch, or 
relocating an insured branch of a foreign 
bank. The FDIC does not have the 
information necessary to quantify the 
benefits to prospective filers associated 
with these aspects of the final rule. 
However, the FDIC believes that these 
clarifications will benefit filers and the 
industry by reducing uncertainty. 
The unquantified benefits discussed 
above are in addition to the quantified 
benefits. Conservatively, if each branch 
filing affected by the final rule were 
submitted by a distinct small bank, then 
the final rule would affect 300 small 
banks. The FDIC does not believe that 
the unquantified benefits would likely 
result in a significant effect for the vast 
majority of the 300 affected banks. 
Finally, the FDIC concludes that the 
final rule does not pose any material 
direct costs to filers. 
In light of the foregoing, the FDIC 
certifies that the final rule does not have 
a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
Accordingly, a final regulatory 
flexibility analysis is not required. 
E. Plain Language 
Section 722 of the Gramm-Leach- 
Bliley Act requires Federal banking 
agencies to use plain language in all 
proposed and final rules published after 
January 1, 2000. The FDIC invited 
comments regarding the use of plain 
language but did not receive any 
relevant comments. The FDIC sought to 
clearly state the provisions of the rule in 
a simple and straightforward manner. 
F. Riegle Community Development and 
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 
Section 302 of the Riegle Community 
Development and Regulatory 
Improvement Act of 1994 (RCDRIA) 
requires that the Federal banking 
agencies, including the FDIC, in 
determining the effective date and 
administrative compliance requirements 
of new regulations that impose 
additional reporting, disclosure, or other 
requirements on insured depository 
institutions (IDIs), consider, consistent 
with principles of safety and soundness 
and the public interest, any 
administrative burdens that such 
regulations would place on depository 
institutions, including small depository 
institutions, and customers of 
depository institutions, as well as the

regulations and amendments to 
regulations prescribed by a Federal 
banking agency that impose additional 
reporting, disclosure, or other new 
requirements on IDI shall take effect on 
the first day of a calendar quarter that 
begins on or after the date on which the 
regulations are published in final form, 
with certain exceptions, including for 
good cause. 
The final rule does not impose 
additional reporting, disclosure, or other 
new requirements on IDIs. As such, the 
provisions of RCDRIA do not apply to 
the FDIC’s determination of the final 
rule’s effective date. 
G. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 
Under Executive Order 12866, as 
affirmed and supplemented by 
Executive Order 13563, ‘‘significant 
regulatory actions’’ are subject to review 
by OMB. The FDIC has submitted this 
regulatory action to OMB for review. 
OMB has determined the rule is not a 
significant regulatory action as defined 
by section 3(f) of Executive Order 
12866. For more information on the 
analysis conducted in connection with 
Executive Order 12866, refer to other 
sections of this 
SUPPLEMENTARY 
INFORMATION. 
H. Executive Order 14192 
Executive Order 14192 directs 
agencies, unless prohibited by law, to 
identify at least 10 existing regulations 
to be repealed when the agency publicly 
proposes for notice and comment or 
otherwise promulgates a new regulation 
with total costs greater than zero. 
Executive Order 14192 further requires 
that new incremental costs associated 
with new regulations shall, to the extent 
permitted by law, be offset by the 
elimination of existing costs associated 
with at least 10 prior regulations. An 
Executive Order 14192 deregulatory 
action is an action that has been 
finalized and has total costs less than 
zero. This final rule is considered an 
Executive Order 14192 deregulatory 
action.

§ 303.41 Definitions. 
* * * * * 
(a) Branch, except as provided in this paragraph (a), includes any branch 
bank, branch office, additional office, or 
any branch place of business located in 
any State of the United States or in any 
territory of the United States, Puerto 
Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Trust 
Territory of the Pacific Islands, the 
Virgin Islands, and the Northern 
Mariana Islands at which deposits are 
received or checks paid or money lent. 
A branch does not include a remote 
service unit or a facility described in 
§ 303.45. The term branch also includes 
the following: 
* * * * * 
(b) Branch relocation means a move within the same immediate 
neighborhood of the existing branch that 
does not substantially affect the nature 
of the business of the branch or the 
customers of the branch. Moving a 
branch to a location outside its 
immediate neighborhood is considered 
the closing of an existing branch and the 
establishment of a new branch. Closing 
of a branch is covered in the FDIC 
Statement of Policy Concerning Branch 
Closing Notices and Policies. 1 FDIC 
Law, Regulations, Related Acts 5391; 
see § 309.4(a) and (b) of this chapter for 
availability. 
(1) Rule of construction. For the purposes of this subpart, a de minimis 
change in address is neither a branch 
establishment nor a branch relocation. 
(i) A de minimis change in address 
occurs when a branch exchanges one 
physical facility for another within the 
same approximate location, such as 
where: 
(A) A direct line of sight exists 
between the two facilities; 
(B) The facilities share the same 
parking area; or 
(C) The facilities are located on 
contiguous properties or on the same 
block. 
(ii) Notice required. Notwithstanding the inapplicability of §§ 303.42 through 
303.44, an insured State nonmember 
bank is required to provide reasonable 
advance written notice to customers of 
the branch undergoing a de minimis 
address change and advance notice to 
the appropriate FDIC office.

Airworthiness Directives; Leonardo 
S.p.A. Helicopters 
AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. 
ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. 
SUMMARY: The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all 
Leonardo S.p.A. Model A119 and 
AW119 MKII helicopters. This AD was 
prompted by reports of trapped residue 
in the rear pneumatic line due to a non- 
optimal cleaning procedure. This AD 
requires accomplishing repetitive 
engine acceleration checks and, 
depending on the results, replacing the 
rear pneumatic line and inspecting the 
fuel control unit (FCU), and 
accomplishing any necessary corrective 
actions. This AD also requires replacing 
certain parts if the engine acceleration 
check exceeds the maximum limit, 
which terminates the repetitive 
acceleration checks. If the limits do not 
exceed the maximum limit, this AD 
would allow this replacement as an 
optional terminating action. 
Additionally, this AD prohibits 
installing an affected engine or FCU on 
a helicopter unless certain requirements 
are met. The FAA is issuing this AD to 
address the unsafe condition on these 
products. 
DATES: This AD is effective January 13, 2026. 
The Director of the Federal Register 
approved the incorporation by reference 
of a certain publication listed in this AD 
as of January 13, 2026. 
The FAA must receive comments on 
this AD by February 12, 2026.

Background 
EASA, which is the Technical Agent 
for the Member States of the European 
Union, has issued EASA AD 2025–0199, 
dated September 16, 2025 (EASA AD 
2025–0199) (also referred to as the 
MCAI), to correct an unsafe condition 
on Leonardo S.p.A. Model A119 and 
AW119MKII helicopters. The MCAI 
states that there have been reports of 
trapped residue in the rear pneumatic 
line caused by a non-optimal cleaning 
procedure during an engine shop visit. 
This condition, if not corrected, could 
result in uncommanded fuel flow 
changes, which could lead to 
accelerations, power rollbacks, or 
instability, and consequent reduced 
control of the helicopter. 
You may examine the MCAI in the 
AD docket at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA–2025–5392. 
Material Incorporated by Reference 
Under 1 CFR Part 51 
The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2025– 
0199, which specifies procedures for 
repetitively conducting engine 
acceleration checks for certain 
helicopters and, depending on the 
results, replacing the rear pneumatic 
line and inspecting the FCU pneumatic 
line input fitting. If there is 
contamination in the FCU pneumatic 
line input fitting, EASA AD 2025–0199 
specifies procedures for replacing the 
FCU and cleaning the forward 
pneumatic line. If no contamination is 
found in the FCU pneumatic line input 
fitting, EASA AD 2025–0199 specifies 
procedures for adjusting the engine 
acceleration and accomplishing 
repetitive engine acceleration checks 
until the rear pneumatic line, engine, or 
FCU is replaced. 
Additionally, EASA AD 2025–0199 
specifies that for certain helicopters 
replacing the rear pneumatic line with 
a serviceable one is a requirement and 
terminates the repetitive acceleration 
checks. EASA AD 2025–0199 also 
specifies that several actions including 
replacing certain parts and 
accomplishing certain checks also 
terminate the repetitive acceleration 
checks. Finally, EASA AD 2025–0199 
prohibits installing an affected engine or 
FCU on a helicopter unless certain 
requirements are met. 
This material is reasonably available 
because the interested parties have 
access to it through their normal course 
of business or by the means identified 
in 
ADDRESSES. 
FAA’s Determination 
These products have been approved 
by the civil aviation authority (CAA) of 
another country and are approved for 
operation in the United States. Pursuant 
to the FAA’s bilateral agreement with 
this State of Design Authority, that 
authority has notified the FAA of the 
unsafe condition described in the MCAI 
referenced above. The FAA is issuing 
this AD after determining that the 
unsafe condition described previously is 
likely to exist or develop on other 
products of the same type design. 
AD Requirements 
This AD requires accomplishing the 
actions specified in EASA AD 2025– 
0199, described previously, as 
incorporated by reference, except for 
any differences identified as exceptions 
in the regulatory text of this AD. See 
‘‘Differences Between this AD and the 
MCAI’’ for a discussion of the general 
differences included in this AD. 
The owner/operator (pilot) holding at 
least a private pilot certificate may 
perform the initial acceleration checks 
and must enter compliance with the 
applicable paragraph(s) of the AD into 
the helicopter maintenance records in 
accordance with 14 CFR 43.9(a) and 
91.417(a)(2)(v). The pilot may perform 
these checks as they involve only a 
ground check and monitoring of the 
engine gauges. These actions could be 
performed equally well by a pilot or a 
mechanic. This is an exception to the 
FAA’s standard maintenance 
regulations. 
Differences Between This AD and the 
MCAI 
The MCAI specifies to replace the 
affected pneumatic line with a 
serviceable pneumatic line immediately 
if acceleration exceeds the maximum 
value during the engine acceleration 
check and within 300 FH [flight hours] 
or 24 months, whichever occurs first, for 
all other helicopters. The 300–FH or 24- 
month compliance time would allow 
enough time to provide notice and 
opportunity for prior public comment so 
this AD allows the replacement as an 
optional terminating action for the 
repetitive acceleration checks but does 
not require the replacement in regards 
to paragraph (5) of EASA AD 2025– 
0199. The FAA is considering further 
rulemaking for this replacement that 
would allow the public the opportunity 
for prior public comment. 
Explanation of Required Compliance 
Information 
In the FAA’s ongoing efforts to 
improve the efficiency of the AD 
process, the FAA developed a process to 
use some CAA ADs as the primary 
source of information for compliance 
with requirements for corresponding

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60561 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations FAA ADs. The FAA has been 
coordinating this process with 
manufacturers and CAAs. As a result, 
EASA AD 2025–0199 is incorporated by 
reference in this AD. This AD requires 
compliance with EASA AD 2025–0199 
in its entirety through that 
incorporation, except for any differences 
identified as exceptions in the 
regulatory text of this AD. Using 
common terms that are the same as the 
heading of a particular section in EASA 
AD 2025–0199 does not mean that 
operators need comply only with that 
section. For example, where the AD 
requirement refers to ‘‘all required 
actions and compliance times,’’ 
compliance with this AD requirement is 
not limited to the section titled 
‘‘Required Action(s) and Compliance 
Time(s)’’ in EASA AD 2025–0199. 
Material required by EASA AD 2025– 
0199 for compliance will be available at 
regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA– 2025–5392 after this AD is published. 
Justification for Immediate Adoption 
and Determination of the Effective Date 
Section 553(b) of the Administrative 
Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 551 et 
seq.) authorizes agencies to dispense 
with notice and comment procedures 
for rules when the agency, for ‘‘good 
cause,’’ finds that those procedures are 
‘‘impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary 
to the public interest.’’ Under this 
section, an agency, upon finding good 
cause, may issue a final rule without 
providing notice and seeking comment 
prior to issuance. Further, section 
553(d) of the APA authorizes agencies to 
make rules effective in less than thirty 
days, upon a finding of good cause. 
An unsafe condition exists that 
requires the immediate adoption of this 
AD without providing an opportunity 
for public comments prior to adoption. 
The FAA has found that the risk to the 
flying public justifies forgoing notice 
and comment prior to adoption of this 
rule because residue in the rear 
pneumatic line if not detected and 
addressed could result in 
uncommanded fuel flow changes 
resulting in accelerations, power 
rollbacks, or instability. Since this 
condition could already exist and result 
in reduced control of the helicopter at 
any time without warning the initial 
engine acceleration check must be 
accomplished within 10 hours time-in- 
service after the effective date of this 
AD. This compliance time is shorter 
than the time necessary for the public to 
comment and for publication of the final 
rule. Accordingly, notice and 
opportunity for prior public comment 
are impracticable and contrary to the 
public interest pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
553(b). 
In addition, the FAA finds that good 
cause exists pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d) 
for making this amendment effective in 
less than 30 days, for the same reasons 
the FAA found good cause to forgo 
notice and comment. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The requirements of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (RFA) do not apply when 
an agency finds good cause pursuant to 
5 U.S.C. 553 to adopt a rule without 
prior notice and comment. Because the 
FAA has determined that it has good 
cause to adopt this rule without prior 
notice and comment, RFA analysis is 
not required. 
Costs of Compliance 
The FAA estimates that this AD 
affects 12 helicopters of U.S. registry. 
The FAA estimates the following 
costs to comply with this AD: 
ESTIMATEDCOSTS 
Action Labor cost Parts cost Cost per 
product 
Cost on U.S. 
operators 
Engine acceleration check .................................... 2 work-hours × $85 per hour = $170 per check .. $0  $170  $2,040 ESTIMATEDCOSTS FOROPTIONALACTIONS

that would be required based on the 
results of the check. The agency has no 
way of determining the number of 
helicopters that might need these 
repairs or replacements:

Title 49 of the United States Code 
specifies the FAA’s authority to issue 
rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, 
section 106, describes the authority of 
the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: 
Aviation Programs describes in more 
detail the scope of the Agency’s 
authority. 
The FAA is issuing this rulemaking 
under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 
44701: General requirements. Under 
that section, Congress charges the FAA 
with promoting safe flight of civil 
aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
regulations for practices, methods, and 
procedures the Administrator finds 
necessary for safety in air commerce. 
This regulation is within the scope of 
that authority because it addresses an 
unsafe condition that is likely to exist or

Regulatory Findings 
This AD will not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a 
substantial direct effect on the States, on 
the relationship between the national 
government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
For the reasons discussed above, I 
certify that this AD: 
(1) Is not a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ under Executive Order 12866, 
and 
(2) Will not affect intrastate aviation 
in Alaska. 
List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39

DIRECTIVES 
1. The authority citation for part 39 
continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701. § 39.13 [Amended] 
2. The FAA amends § 39.13 by adding 
the following new airworthiness 
directive: 
2025–25–13 Leonardo S.p.A.: Amendment 
39–23221; Docket No. FAA–2025–5392; 
Project Identifier MCAI–2025–01494–R. 
(a) Effective Date 
This airworthiness directive (AD) is 
effective January 13, 2026. 
(b) Affected ADs 
None. 
(c) Applicability 
This AD applies to Leonardo S.p.A. Model 
A119 and AW119 MKII helicopters, 
certificated in any category. 
(d) Subject 
Joint Aircraft System Component (JASC) 
Code 7100, Powerplant System. 
(e) Unsafe Condition 
This AD was prompted by reports of 
trapped residue in the rear pneumatic line 
due to non-optimal cleaning procedures. The 
FAA is issuing this AD to detect and correct 
a contaminated rear pneumatic line. The 
unsafe condition, if not corrected, could 
result in uncommanded fuel flow changes, 
which could lead to accelerations, power 
rollbacks, or instability, and consequent 
reduced control of the helicopter. 
(f) Compliance 
Comply with this AD within the 
compliance times specified, unless already 
done. 
(g) Required Actions 
Except as specified in paragraphs (h) and 
(i) of this AD: Comply with all required 
actions and compliance times specified in, 
and in accordance with, European Union 
Aviation Safety Agency AD 2025–0199, dated 
September 16, 2025 (EASA AD 2025–0199). 
(h) Exceptions to EASA AD 2025–0199 
(1) Where EASA AD 2025–0199 refers to its 
effective date, this AD requires using the 
effective date of this AD. 
(2) Where EASA AD 2025–0199 requires 
compliance in terms of flight hours, this AD 
requires using hours time-in-service. 
(3) Where the definition of affected 
engines, affected FCU [fuel control unit], 
affected pneumatic line, and serviceable 
pneumatic line in EASA AD 2025–0199 all 
refer to ‘‘the P&WC SB No. A39125R1’’, for 
this AD replace that text with ‘‘the applicable 
original issue of the alert service bulletin 
listed in the Ref. Publications section 
(referencing P&WC SB No. A39125R1)’’. 
(4) Where paragraph (1) and paragraph 
(4.2) of EASA AD 2025–0199 specifies 
‘‘accomplish acceleration checks of the 
engine in accordance with the instructions of 
the Part 1 of the ASB (referencing Part A of 
the P&WC SB No. A39125R1)’’, for this AD 
replace that text with ‘‘accomplish 
acceleration checks of the engine’’. The 
owner/operator (pilot) holding at least a 
private pilot certificate may perform the 
checks required by paragraph (g) of this AD 
and must enter compliance with these 
paragraphs into the helicopter maintenance 
records in accordance with 14 CFR 43.9(a) 
and 91.417(a)(2)(v). The record must be 
maintained as required by 14 CFR 91.417, 
121.380, or 135.439. 
(5) Where paragraph (5) of EASA AD 2025– 
0199 specifies to replace the affected 
pneumatic line with a serviceable pneumatic 
line within 300 FH or 24 months, whichever 
occurs first, for this AD that replacement is 
only required before further flight per 
paragraph (2) of EASA AD 2025–0199. For 
this AD if not required by paragraph (2) of 
EASA AD 2025–0199 this replacement is an 
optional terminating action for the repetitive 
acceleration checks required by paragraph (1) 
of EASA AD 2025–0199. 
(6) This AD does not adopt the ‘‘Remarks’’ 
section of EASA AD 2025–0199. 
(i) No Reporting Requirement 
Although the material referenced in EASA 
AD 2025–0199 specifies to submit certain 
information to the manufacturer, this AD 
does not require that action. 
(j) Alternative Methods of Compliance 
(AMOCs) 
(1) The Manager, International Validation 
Branch, FAA, has the authority to approve 
AMOCs for this AD, if requested using the

Airworthiness Directives; Airbus SAS 
Airplanes 
AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. 
ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. 
SUMMARY: The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2025–13– 
12, which applied to all Airbus SAS 
Model A350–941 and –1041 airplanes. 
AD 2025–13–12 required replacement of 
any affected elevator flight control 
remote module (FCRM), prohibited the 
installation of aileron or spoiler FCRMs 
in place of elevator or rudder FCRMs, 
and limited the installation of FCRMs 
under certain conditions. Since the FAA 
issued AD 2025–13–12, the 
manufacturer developed a modification 
that eliminates the unsafe condition. 
This AD continues to require the actions 
of AD 2025–13–12. This AD also 
requires installation of the flight control 
and guidance system (FCGS) primary 
computer (PRIM) P14.1.3 and secondary 
computer (SEC) S14.1.2 software 
standards and prohibits installation of 
earlier software standards. The FAA is 
issuing this AD to address the unsafe 
condition on these products. 
DATES: This AD is effective January 13, 2026. 
The Director of the Federal Register 
approved the incorporation by reference 
of a certain publication listed in this AD 
as of January 13, 2026. 
The FAA must receive comments on 
this AD by February 12, 2026.

Background 
The FAA issued AD 2025–13–12, 
Amendment 39–23078 (90 FR 30577, 
July 10, 2025) (AD 2025–13–12), for all 
Model A350–941 and –1041 airplanes. 
AD 2025–13–12 was prompted by an 
MCAI originated by EASA, which is the 
Technical Agent for the Member States 
of the European Union. EASA issued 
AD 2025–0129, dated June 5, 2025 
(EASA AD 2025–0129), to correct an 
unsafe condition. EASA AD 2025–0129 
states that an occurrence of loss of 
control of an outboard aileron surface 
was reported. Subsequent investigations 
determined that the electronic card of 
the FCRM of that aileron had been 
contaminated by hydraulic fluid. In 
addition, EASA determined that certain 
servocontrols were exposed to hydraulic 
contamination before delivery of the 
airplane to its first operator. Due to the 
similarity of design, elevator and rudder 
FCRMs could be subject to the same 
failure mode. EASA AD 2025–0129 also 
stated the AD was considered an interim 
action and that further AD action might 
follow. 
AD 2025–13–12 required replacement 
of any affected elevator FCRM and 
prohibited the installation of aileron or 
spoiler FCRMs in place of elevator or 
rudder FCRMs. AD 2025–13–12 also 
limited the installation of aileron or 
spoiler FCRMs in place of elevator or 
rudder FCRMs. The FAA issued AD 
2025–13–12 to address the unsafe 
condition on all Model A350–941 and 
–1041 airplanes. 
Actions Since AD 2025–13–12 Was 
Issued 
Since the FAA issued AD 2025–13– 
12, EASA superseded EASA AD 2025– 
0129 with EASA AD 2025–0197R1,

2025–0197R1) (also referred to as the 
MCAI), to correct an unsafe condition 
for all Airbus SAS Model A350–941 and 
–1041 airplanes. After issuance of EASA 
AD 2025–0129, Airbus developed a 
modification, which includes installing 
FCGS PRIM P14.1.3 and SEC S14.1.2 
software standards, to eliminate the 
unsafe condition. 
The preamble to AD 2025–13–12 
explained that the FAA considered that 
AD an interim action. The FAA has 
determined that further rulemaking is 
indeed necessary to mandate the 
terminating action developed by the 
airplane manufacturer. 
The FAA is issuing this AD to address 
the unsafe condition on these products. 
You may examine the MCAI in the AD 
docket at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA–2025–5390. 
Explanation of Retained Requirements 
Although this AD does not explicitly 
restate the requirements of AD 2025– 
13–12, this AD retains all of the 
requirements of AD 2025–13–12. Those 
requirements are referenced in EASA 
AD 2025–0197R1, which, in turn, is 
referenced in paragraph (g) of this AD. 
Material Incorporated by Reference 
Under 1 CFR Part 51 
The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2025– 
0197R1. This material describes 
procedures for replacing affected 
FCRMs, which have been exposed to 
hydraulic fuel contamination, with 
serviceable FCRMs and repairing any 
related hydraulic leaks. EASA AD 2025– 
0197R1 prohibits ‘‘swapping’’ elevator 
or rudder FCRMs with spoiler or aileron 
FCRMs and installing an FCRM unless 
it is a serviceable FCRM. EASA AD 
2025–0197R1 also describes procedures 
for modifying the FCGS by installing 
PRIM P14.1.3 and SEC S14.1.2 software 
standards and prohibits installation of 
earlier FCGS software standards after 
modification. EASA AD 2025–0197R1 
specifies that the modification 
terminates the replacement of affected 
FCRMs, the prohibition for swapping 
elevator or rudder FCRMs with spoiler 
or aileron FCRMs, and the limitation for 
installing only a serviceable FCRM. 
This material is reasonably available 
because the interested parties have 
access to it through their normal course 
of business or by the means identified 
in the 
ADDRESSESsection. 
FAA’s Determination 
These products have been approved 
by the civil aviation authority of another 
country and are approved for operation 
in the United States. Pursuant to the 
FAA’s bilateral agreement with this 
State of Design Authority, that authority 
has notified the FAA of the unsafe 
condition described in the MCAI 
referenced above. The FAA is issuing 
this AD after determining that the 
unsafe condition described previously is 
likely to exist or develop on other 
products of the same type design. 
AD Requirements 
This AD retains all requirements of 
AD 2025–13–12. This AD requires 
accomplishing the actions specified in 
EASA AD 2025–0197R1 described 
previously, except for any differences 
identified as exceptions in the 
regulatory text of this AD. 
Explanation of Required Compliance 
Information 
In the FAA’s ongoing efforts to 
improve the efficiency of the AD 
process, the FAA developed a process to 
use some civil aviation authority (CAA) 
ADs as the primary source of 
information for compliance with 
requirements for corresponding FAA 
ADs. The FAA has been coordinating 
this process with manufacturers and 
CAAs. As a result, EASA AD 2025– 
0197R1 is incorporated by reference in 
this AD. This AD requires compliance 
with EASA AD 2025–0197R1 in its 
entirety through that incorporation, 
except for any differences identified as 
exceptions in the regulatory text of this 
AD. Using common terms that are the 
same as the heading of a particular 
section in EASA AD 2025–0197R1 does 
not mean that operators need comply 
only with that section. For example, 
where the AD requirement refers to ‘‘all 
required actions and compliance times,’’ 
compliance with this AD requirement is 
not limited to the section titled 
‘‘Required Action(s) and Compliance 
Time(s)’’ in EASA AD 2025–0197R1. 
Material required by EASA AD 2025– 
0197R1 for compliance will be available 
at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA–2025–5390 after this AD is 
published. 
Justification for Immediate Adoption 
and Determination of the Effective Date 
Section 553(b) of the Administrative 
Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 551 et 
seq.) authorizes agencies to dispense 
with notice and comment procedures 
for rules when the agency, for ‘‘good 
cause,’’ finds that those procedures are 
‘‘impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary 
to the public interest.’’ Under this 
section, an agency, upon finding good 
cause, may issue a final rule without 
providing notice and seeking comment 
prior to issuance. Further, section 
553(d) of the APA authorizes agencies to 
make rules effective in less than thirty 
days, upon a finding of good cause. 
An unsafe condition exists that 
requires the immediate adoption of this 
AD without providing an opportunity 
for public comments prior to adoption. 
The FAA has found that the risk to the 
flying public justifies forgoing notice 
and comment prior to adoption of this 
rule because an aileron FCRM electronic 
card exposed to hydraulic fluid has led 
to loss of control of an outboard aileron 
surface, and elevator and rudder FCRM 
electronic cards exposed to hydraulic 
fluid are also subject to failure due to 
their similarity of design. Control of the 
airplane is significantly degraded 
through the loss of control of an elevator 
or rudder surface, resulting in loss of 
control of the airplane. To mitigate this 
unsafe condition, the FAA issued 
interim AD 2025–13–12 to require 
replacement of affected FCRMs. 
However, those replacements are not 
repetitive, and the modification must be 
accomplished to eliminate the unsafe 
condition. Additionally, the compliance 
time in this AD is shorter than the time 
necessary for the public to comment and 
for publication of the final rule. 
Accordingly, notice and opportunity for 
prior public comment are impracticable 
and contrary to the public interest 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b). 
In addition, the FAA finds that good 
cause exists pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d) 
for making this amendment effective in 
less than 30 days, for the same reasons 
the FAA found good cause to forgo 
notice and comment. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The requirements of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (RFA) do not apply when 
an agency finds good cause pursuant to 
5 U.S.C. 553 to adopt a rule without 
prior notice and comment. Because the 
FAA has determined that it has good 
cause to adopt this rule without notice 
and comment, RFA analysis is not 
required. 
Costs of Compliance 
The FAA estimates that this AD 
affects 39 airplanes of U.S. registry. The 
FAA estimates the following costs to 
comply with this AD:

Title 49 of the United States Code 
specifies the FAA’s authority to issue 
rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, 
section 106, describes the authority of 
the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: 
Aviation Programs, describes in more 
detail the scope of the Agency’s 
authority. 
The FAA is issuing this rulemaking 
under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 
44701: General requirements. Under 
that section, Congress charges the FAA 
with promoting safe flight of civil 
aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
regulations for practices, methods, and 
procedures the Administrator finds 
necessary for safety in air commerce. 
This regulation is within the scope of 
that authority because it addresses an 
unsafe condition that is likely to exist or 
develop on products identified in this 
rulemaking action. 
Regulatory Findings 
This AD will not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a 
substantial direct effect on the States, on 
the relationship between the national 
government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
For the reasons discussed above, I 
certify that this AD: 
(1) Is not a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ under Executive Order 12866, 
and 
(2) Will not affect intrastate aviation 
in Alaska.

The Amendment 
Accordingly, under the authority 
delegated to me by the Administrator, 
the FAA amends 14 CFR part 39 as 
follows: 
PART 39—AIRWORTHINESS 
DIRECTIVES 
1. The authority citation for part 39 
continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701. § 39.13 [Amended] 
2. The FAA amends § 39.13 by: 
a. Removing Airworthiness Directive 
2025–13–12, Amendment 39–23078 (90 
FR 30577, July 10, 2025); and 
b. Adding the following new 
airworthiness directive: 
2025–25–12 Airbus SAS: Amendment 39– 
23220; Docket No. FAA–2025–5390; 
Project Identifier MCAI–2025–01470–T. 
(a) Effective Date 
This airworthiness directive (AD) is 
effective January 13, 2026. 
(b) Affected ADs 
This AD replaces AD 2025–13–12, 
Amendment 39–23078 (90 FR 30577, July 10, 
2025) (AD 2025–13–12). 
(c) Applicability 
This AD applies to all Airbus SAS Model 
A350–941 and –1041 airplanes, certificated 
in any category. 
(d) Subject 
Air Transport Association (ATA) of

(e) Reason 
This AD was prompted by a report of loss 
of control of an outboard aileron surface due 
to hydraulic fluid contaminating an 
electronic card of the flight control remote 
module (FCRM). The FAA is issuing this AD 
to address FCRM electronic cards exposed to 
hydraulic fluid contamination. This 
condition, if not detected and corrected, 
could lead to runaway of rudder or elevator 
surface, resulting in loss of control of the 
airplane. 
(f) Compliance 
Comply with this AD within the 
compliance times specified, unless already 
done. 
(g) Requirements 
Except as specified in paragraph (h) of this 
AD: Comply with all required actions and 
compliance times specified in, and in 
accordance with, European Union Aviation 
Safety Agency (EASA) AD 2025–0197R1, 
dated September 26, 2025 (EASA AD 2025–

Standard Instrument Approach 
Procedures, and Takeoff Minimums 
and Obstacle Departure Procedures; 
Miscellaneous Amendments 
AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. 
ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule amends, suspends, or removes Standard Instrument 
Approach Procedures (SIAPs) and 
associated Takeoff Minimums and 
Obstacle Departure Procedures for 
operations at certain airports. These 
regulatory actions are needed because of 
the adoption of new or revised criteria, 
or because of changes occurring in the 
National Airspace System, such as the 
commissioning of new navigational 
facilities, adding new obstacles, or 
changing air traffic requirements. These 
changes are designed to provide for the 
safe and efficient use of the navigable 
airspace and to promote safe flight 
operations under instrument flight rules 
at the affected airports. 
DATES: This rule is effective December 29, 2025. The compliance date for each 
SIAP, associated Takeoff Minimums, 
and ODP is specified in the amendatory 
provisions. 
The incorporation by reference of 
certain publications listed in the 
regulations is approved by the Director 
of the Federal Register as of December 
29, 2025.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60567 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations incorporated by reference under 5 
U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and 14 
CFR 97.20. The large number of SIAPs, 
their complex nature, and the need for 
a special format make their verbatim 
publication in the Federal Register 
expensive and impractical. Further, 
pilots do not use the regulatory text of 
the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic 
depiction on charts printed by 
publishers of aeronautical materials. 
Thus, the advantages of incorporation 
by reference are realized and 
publication of the complete description 
of each SIAP contained on FAA form 
documents is unnecessary. This 
amendment provides the affected CFR 
sections, and specifies the SIAPs and 
Takeoff Minimums and ODPs with their 
applicable effective dates. This 
amendment also identifies the airport 
and its location, the procedure and the 
amendment number. 
Availability and Summary of Material 
Incorporated by Reference 
The material incorporated by 
reference is publicly available as listed 
in the 
ADDRESSESsection. 
The material incorporated by 
reference describes SIAPs, Takeoff 
Minimums and ODPs as identified in 
the amendatory language for part 97 of 
this final rule. 
The Rule 
This amendment to 14 CFR part 97 is 
effective upon publication of each 
separate SIAP and Takeoff Minimums 
and ODP as amended in the transmittal. 
For safety and timeliness of change 
considerations, this amendment 
incorporates only specific changes 
contained for each SIAP and Takeoff 
Minimums and ODP as modified by 
FDC permanent NOTAMs. 
The SIAPs and Takeoff Minimums 
and ODPs, as modified by FDC 
permanent NOTAM, and contained in 
this amendment are based on criteria 
contained in the U.S. Standard for 
Terminal Instrument Procedures 
(TERPS). In developing these changes to 
SIAPs and Takeoff Minimums and 
ODPs, the TERPS criteria were applied 
only to specific conditions existing at 
the affected airports. All SIAP 
amendments in this rule have been 
previously issued by the FAA in a FDC 
NOTAM as an emergency action of 
immediate flight safety relating directly 
to published aeronautical charts. 
The circumstances that created the 
need for these SIAP and Takeoff 
Minimums and ODP amendments 
require making them effective in less 
than 30 days. 
Because of the close and immediate 
relationship between these SIAPs, 
Takeoff Minimums and ODPs, and 
safety in air commerce, I find that notice 
and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 
553(b) are impracticable and contrary to 
the public interest and, where 
applicable, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d), good 
cause exists for making these SIAPs 
effective in less than 30 days. 
The FAA has determined that this 
regulation only involves an established 
body of technical regulations for which 
frequent and routine amendments are 
necessary to keep them operationally 
current. It, therefore—(1) is not a 
‘‘significant regulatory action’’ under 
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
‘‘significant rule’’ under DOT regulatory 
Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; 
February 26, 1979); and (3) does not 
warrant preparation of a regulatory 
evaluation as the anticipated impact is 
so minimal. For the same reason, the 
FAA certifies that this amendment will 
not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule amends 14 CFR part 97 by establishing, 
amending, suspending, or removes 
SIAPS, Takeoff Minimums and/or 
ODPS. The complete regulatory 
description of each SIAP and its 
associated Takeoff Minimums or ODP 
for an identified airport is listed on FAA 
form documents which are incorporated 
by reference in this amendment under 5 
U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and 14 
CFR 97.20. The applicable FAA Forms 
are 8260–3, 8260–4, 8260–5, 8260–15A, 
8260–15B, when required by an entry 
on 8260–15A, and 8260–15C. 
The large number of SIAPs, Takeoff 
Minimums and ODPs, their complex 
nature, and the need for a special format 
make publication in the Federal 
Register expensive and impractical. Further, pilots do not use the regulatory 
text of the SIAPs, Takeoff Minimums or 
ODPs, but instead refer to their graphic 
depiction on charts printed by 
publishers of aeronautical materials. 
Thus, the advantages of incorporation 
by reference are realized and 
publication of the complete description 
of each SIAP, Takeoff Minimums and 
ODP listed on FAA form documents is 
unnecessary. This amendment provides 
the affected CFR sections and specifies 
the types of SIAPS, Takeoff Minimums 
and ODPs with their applicable effective 
dates. This amendment also identifies 
the airport and its location, the 
procedure, and the amendment number. 
Availability and Summary of Material 
Incorporated by Reference 
The material incorporated by 
reference is publicly available as listed 
in the 
ADDRESSESsection. 
The material incorporated by 
reference describes SIAPS, Takeoff 
Minimums and/or ODPs as identified in 
the amendatory language for part 97 of 
this final rule. 
The Rule 
This amendment to 14 CFR part 97 is 
effective upon publication of each 
separate SIAP, Takeoff Minimums and 
ODP as amended in the transmittal. 
Some SIAP and Takeoff Minimums and 
textual ODP amendments may have 
been issued previously by the FAA in a 
Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to 
Airmen (NOTAM) as an emergency 
action of immediate flights safety 
relating directly to published 
aeronautical charts. 
The circumstances that created the 
need for some SIAP and Takeoff 
Minimums and ODP amendments may 
require making them effective in less 
than 30 days. For the remaining SIAPs 
and Takeoff Minimums and ODPs, an 
effective date at least 30 days after 
publication is provided. 
Further, the SIAPs and Takeoff 
Minimums and ODPs contained in this 
amendment are based on the criteria 
contained in the U.S. Standard for 
Terminal Instrument Procedures 
(TERPS). In developing these SIAPs and 
Takeoff Minimums and ODPs, the 
TERPS criteria were applied to the 
conditions existing or anticipated at the 
affected airports. Because of the close 
and immediate relationship between 
these SIAPs, Takeoff Minimums and 
ODPs, and safety in air commerce, I find 
that notice and public procedure under 
5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and 
contrary to the public interest and, 
where applicable, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d), 
good cause exists for making some 
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days. 
The FAA has determined that this 
regulation only involves an established 
body of technical regulations for which 
frequent and routine amendments are 
necessary to keep them operationally

number of small entities under the 
criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
On March 20, 2024, HUD published 
the final rule (89 FR 20032), which 
amended the regulations to the Section 
184 Indian Housing Loan Guarantee 
Program (Section 184 Program). Since 
its inception, the Section 184 Program 
has experienced an increase in demand. 
As a result, the final rule updated 
program regulations to minimize 
potential risk and increase program 
participation by financial institutions, 
and added eligibility and participation 
requirements for Lender Applicants, 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:12 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\29DER1.SGM 29DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60570 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations Direct Guarantee Lenders, Non-Direct 
Guarantee Lenders, Holders and 
Servicers and other Section 184 Program 
participants. The final rule also clarified 
the rules governing Tribal participation 
in the program, established 
underwriting requirements, specifies 
rules on the closing and endorsement 
process, established stronger and clearer 
servicing requirements, established 
program rules governing claims 
submitted by servicers and paid by 
HUD, and added standards governing 
monitoring, reporting, sanctions, and 
appeals. Lastly, the final rule added new 
definitions and makes statutory 
conforming amendments, including the 
categorical exclusion of the Section 184 
Program in HUD’s environmental 
review regulations. 
On June 14, 2024, HUD published a 
document in the Federal Register (89 
FR 50523) announcing that the final 
rule’s effective date would be delayed 
from June 18, 2024, to December 31, 
2024, with a compliance date of March 
1, 2025. Subsequently, HUD published 
an additional document in Federal 
Register (90 FR 5604) extending the compliance date for the final rule from 
March 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025. 
II. Delay of Compliance Date 
HUD is currently drafting a handbook 
to implement the final rule. The 
handbook will provide comprehensive 
guidance and clarification for all 
stakeholders to fully understand and 
implement the final rule. Given the size 
of the handbook, its accompanying 
forms, level of additional consultation 
with stakeholders needed to complete 
the handbook, and intensive training on 
key components of the new handbook 
that must be given to stakeholders, HUD 
has determined that it needs additional 
time before enforcing the final rule. 
Further, HUD has heard from Tribes, 
lenders, servicers, and other 
participants that additional time is 
needed after the publication of the 
handbook for these stakeholders to 
conform their policies, procedures, and 
systems to comply with the handbook 
and the final rule. 
As a result of these factors, HUD is 
therefore indefinitely delaying the 
compliance date of the final rule. When 
HUD completes updates to the 
handbook, HUD will publish an 
additional Federal Register notice announcing a new compliance date for 
the final rule. This future notice will 
provide a reasonable time for 
implementation before requiring 
compliance, of at least 30 and up to 90 
days after the publication of the notice.

28 CFR Part 0 
[Docket No. JMD165; AG Order No. 6570– 
2025] 
Consolidation of the Office of the 
Executive Secretariat Into the Justice 
Management Division 
AGENCY: Department of Justice. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule amends the Department’s organizational regulations 
by eliminating the Office of the 
Executive Secretariat as a separate office 
and consolidating its functions within 
the Justice Management Division. 
DATES: Effective December 29, 2025. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John E. Thompson, Deputy General Counsel, 
Justice Management Division; email: 
John.E.Thompson@usdoj.gov. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Summary 
On January 17, 2025, the Department 
of Justice published a final rule 
amending its organizational regulations 
to establish the functions of the Office 
of the Executive Secretariat (‘‘OES’’) 
which had been created as a separate 
component of the Department on 
August 17, 2023. Office of the Executive 
Secretariat, 90 FR 5608 (Jan. 17, 2025). 
Upon further consideration of the best 
way to organize the Department and 
consistent with the Administration’s 
deregulatory and streamlining 
initiatives, this rule rescinds the prior 
establishment of OES as a separate 
component. This rule restores its 
functions to a staff within the Justice 
Management Division, which had 
formerly performed those functions 
prior to the August 17, 2023, 
establishment of OES. 
This rule also revises 28 CFR 0.1 to 
delete OES from the list of Department 
components. 
II. Administrative Procedure Act 
This rule is a rule of agency 
organization, procedure, and practice 
and is limited to matters of agency 
management and personnel. Therefore, 
it is not a substantive rule, and, as such, 
it is exempt from the requirements of 
prior notice and comment and a 30-day 
delay in the effective date. See 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2), (b)(A), (d). 
III. Regulatory Analyses 
In developing this final rule, the 
Department considered numerous 
statutes and executive orders applicable 
to the rulemaking process. The 
Department’s analysis of the 
applicability of those statutes and 
executive orders to this rule is 
summarized below. 
A. Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory 
Planning and Review), Executive Order 
13563 (Improving Regulation and 
Regulatory Review), and Executive 
Order 14192 (Unleashing Prosperity 
Through Deregulation) 
This final rule is not a significant 
regulatory action under section 3(f) of 
Executive Order 12866, and as 
supplemented by Executive Order 
13563. This rule is limited to agency 
organization, management, and 
personnel as described by Executive 
Order 12866, section 3(d)(3), and 
therefore is not a ‘‘regulation’’ or ‘‘rule’’ 
as defined by that Executive Order. 
Accordingly, this action has not been 
reviewed by the Office of Management 
and Budget. 
Further, as this rule relates to agency 
organization, management, or 
personnel, it is fully exempt from the 
numerical 10-for-1 and cost offset 
requirements of Executive Order 14192. 
B. Executive Order 14294 
(Overcriminalization of Federal 
Regulations) 
Executive Order 14294 requires 
agencies promulgating regulations with 
criminal regulatory offenses potentially 
subject to criminal enforcement to 
explicitly describe the conduct subject 
to criminal enforcement, the authorizing 
statutes, and the mens rea standard 
applicable to each element of those 
offenses. This final rule does not impose 
a criminal regulatory penalty and is thus 
exempt from E.O. 14924 requirements. 
C. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 
1980, 5 U.S.C. 601–612, as amended, 
requires Federal agencies to consider 
the potential impact of regulations on 
small entities during rulemaking. The 
term ‘‘small entities’’ comprises small 
businesses, not-for-profit organizations 
that are independently owned and 
operated and are not dominant in their 
fields, and governmental jurisdictions 
with populations of less than 50,000. 5 
U.S.C. 601.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60571 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations A Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is 
not required for this final rule because 
the Department is not required to 
publish a general notice of proposed 
rulemaking for this matter. 
D. Paperwork Reduction Act 
This final rule does not call for a new 
or revised collection of information 
under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501–3520. 
E. Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) 
A rule has federalism implications 
under Executive Order 13132 if it has a 
substantial direct effect on the States, on 
the relationship between the national 
government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. E.O. 13132, sec. 
1(a). The Department has analyzed this 
final rule under that Order and 
determined that this rule does not have 
federalism implications. 
F. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 
1995 
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1531–1538, requires 
Federal agencies to determine whether a 
rule, if promulgated, will result in the 
expenditure by State, local, or Tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector, of $100 million (adjusted 
annually for inflation) or more in any 
one year. 2 U.S.C. 1532(a). This final 
rule does not require or result in 
expenditures by any of the above-named 
entities. 
G. Executive Order 12988 (Civil Justice 
Reform), Plain Language 
This final rule meets applicable 
standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of 
Executive Order 12988. 
H. Executive Order 13175 (Consultation 
and Coordination With Indian Tribal 
Governments) 
This final rule does not have Tribal 
implications under Executive Order 
13175 because it would not have a 
substantial direct effect on one or more 
Indian tribes, on the relationship 
between the Federal Government and 
Indian tribes, or on the distribution of 
power and responsibilities between the 
Federal Government and Indian tribes. 
I. Congressional Review Act 
This rule relates to agency 
management, personnel, and 
organization, and does not substantially 
affect the rights or obligations of non- 
agency parties. 5 U.S.C. 804(3)(B), (C). 
This action is accordingly not a ‘‘rule’’ 
as that term is used in the Congressional 
Review Act, see 5 U.S.C. 804(3), and the reporting requirement of 5 U.S.C. 801 
does not apply.

SUMMARY: On January 2, 2025, DHS adjusted for inflation its civil monetary 
penalties for 2025, in accordance with 
the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation 
Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 
2015 and Executive Office of the 
President (EOP) Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) guidance. The new 
penalty amounts were effective for 
penalties assessed after January 2, 2025, 
whose associated violations occurred 
after November 2, 2015. DHS is making 
a technical amendment to the Code of 
Federal Regulations to make several 
clerical revisions to the codified 2025 
penalty amounts. 
DATES: This technical amendment is effective on December 29, 2025.

I. Statutory and Regulatory Background 
On November 2, 2015, the President 
signed into law the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act 
Improvements Act of 2015 (Pub. L. 114– 
74 section 701 (Nov. 2, 2015)) (2015 
Act). The 2015 Act amended the Federal 
Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act 
of 1990 (28 U.S.C. 2461 note) to further 
improve the effectiveness of civil 
monetary penalties and to maintain 
their deterrent effect. The 2015 Act 
required agencies to make annual 
adjustments for inflation. On January 2, 
2025, DHS published a final rule 
making the 2025 annual inflation 
adjustments to its civil monetary 
penalties pursuant to the 2015 Act and 
pursuant to guidance OMB issued to 
agencies on December 17, 2024 (January 
2025 rule). See 90 FR 1 (Jan. 2, 2025). 
The penalty amounts were effective for 
penalties assessed after January 2, 2025,

II. Technical Revisions 
DHS is making a technical 
amendment to the Code of Federal 
Regulations. This technical amendment 
will make several clerical revisions to 
the codified 2025 penalty amounts. 
Specifically, DHS is making clerical 
revisions in the Coast Guard’s and the 
Transportation Security 
Administration’s codified 2025 penalty 
amounts. 
The preamble of the January 2025 rule 
described inflation adjustments to all 
152 Coast Guard penalties. However, for 
five of the 152 penalties, the Coast 
Guard inadvertently failed to make 
corresponding adjustments to the 
codified penalty table in 33 CFR 27.3. 
This rule revises Table 1 in 33 CFR 27.3 
to include the correct 2025 inflation- 
adjusted penalty amounts for the 
affected penalties, consistent with the 
amounts set out in the preamble of the 
January 2025 rule. The Coast Guard is 
revising only the five penalties in the 
table below. All other penalty amounts 
in the table remain unchanged.

In addition, TSA determined that a 
statutory revision enacted in May 2024 
required an update to the January 2025 
rule. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 
2024 (Pub. L. 118–63, 138 Stat. 1025, 
1102 (May 16, 2024)) amended 49 
U.S.C. 46301 to raise the statutory 
maximum civil monetary penalty 
amounts that TSA may assess for 
security violations. This rule revises the 
relevant penalty provisions to 
incorporate the 2024 statutory 
amendment to 49 U.S.C. 46301 and the 
2025 adjustment for inflation. This rule 
ensures that the regulatory text 
accurately reflects TSA’s current 
statutory penalty authority and 
accordingly the civil monetary penalty 
amounts as adjusted for inflation.

III. Administrative Procedure Act 
(APA) 
DHS is issuing this rule without prior 
notice and comment because the 
Department has determined that good 
cause exists under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). 
The APA permits an agency to dispense 
with notice and comment when doing 
so would be ‘‘impracticable, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public 
interest.’’ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). This 
amendment falls within the unnecessary 
prong because, for both the Coast Guard 
and TSA revisions, it makes only non- 
substantive, corrective revisions to the 
civil monetary penalty adjustments 
published in the January 2025 rule. See 
North Carolina Growers’ Ass’n, Inc. v. 
United Farm Workers, 702 F.3d 755, 
766–67 (4th Cir. 2012) (describing the 
unnecessary prong as ‘‘when 
amendments are minor or merely 
technical and of little public interest’’ 
(citation omitted)). 
As discussed above, the Coast Guard 
inadvertently excluded several properly 
inflation-adjusted penalty amounts from 
the codified table in 33 CFR 27.3 in the 
2025 annual adjustment rule, even 
though the correct amounts appeared in 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:12 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\29DER1.SGM 29DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60573 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations the preamble. This technical 
amendment corrects that clerical 
oversight. The revision is non- 
substantive, as it merely brings the 
regulatory text into alignment with the 
penalty levels listed in the preamble, 
which the Coast Guard intended to be 
operative for 2025. 
Also as discussed above, TSA 
updated the January 2025 rule to 
account for a statutory amendment 
enacted in May 2024 that increased 
certain maximum penalty authorities 
under 49 U.S.C. 46301. Without this 
update, the CFR would continue to 
reflect the outdated maximum amounts 
rather than those currently authorized 
by Congress. Accordingly, this rule 
revises the regulatory text to reflect the 
updated statutory maximum amounts. 
This revision is also non-substantive 
and corrective, as it merely conforms 
the CFR to statutorily authorized 
penalty maximums already in effect that 
the Department lacks discretion to 
modify. 
DHS therefore finds notice and 
comment unnecessary under 5 U.S.C. 
553(b)(B). For the same reasons, DHS 
also finds good cause under 5 U.S.C. 
553(d)(3) to make this technical 
amendment effective upon publication.

AGENCY: Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security. 
ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for 
certain navigable waters of the Houston 
Ship Channel around the Beltway 8 
Bridge (Sam Houston Tollway Ship 
Channel Bridge), during bridge 
construction and demolition activities. 
The temporary safety zone is needed to 
protect personnel, vessels, and the 
marine environment from potential 
hazards created by constructing a new 
bridge. Entry of vessels or persons into 
this zone is prohibited unless 
specifically authorized by the Captain of 
the Port, Sector Houston-Galveston. 
DATES: This rule is effective without actual notice from December 29, 2025 
through March 1, 2030. For the 
purposes of enforcement, actual notice 
will be used from December 22, 2025, 
until December 29, 2025.

II. Background and Authority 
On July 24, 2025, construction of the 
new Beltway 8 Bridge (Sam Houston 
Tollway Ship Channel Bridge) started 
over the navigable waters of the 
Houston Ship Channel. The Coast Guard 
previously published a short-term 
temporary safety zone to cover the 
initial phase of this construction, which 
covers only a small area along the north 
and south shorelines around the bridge 
(90 FR 35437, July 28, 2025). The Coast 
Guard also published a notice of 
proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to 
establish a long-term temporary safety 
zone for this project (90 FR 43950, 
September 11, 2025). In that NPRM, we 
stated why we issued the NPRM and 
invited comments on our proposed 
regulatory action.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60577 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations Under the authority in 46 U.S.C. 
70034, the COTP has determined that 
this rule is necessary to protect 
personnel, vessels, and the marine 
environment from potential hazards 
associated with this bridge demolition 
and construction project. Hazards 
associated with this project include 
falling construction equipment, 
materials, or other debris. No vessel or 
person will be permitted to enter the 
safety zone without obtaining 
permission from the COTP or their 
designated representative during 
periods of enforcement. 
The Coast Guard finds that under 5 
U.S.C. 553(d)(3), good cause exists for 
making this rule effective less than 30 
days after publication in the Federal 
Register because it is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. 
Construction for this project has begun, 
impacts to the waterway are on-going, 
and the previously established short- 
term safety zone regulation has expired. 
Therefore, this zone must be established 
immediately to protect personnel, 
vessels, and the marine environment. 
III. Discussion of Comments and the 
Rule 
During the comment period that 
ended on October 14, 2025, we received 
one comment. The comment supported 
the safety zone and encouraged the 
Coast Guard to elaborate on timing for 
closure of the federal channel to 
improve coordination and to assist 
affected users with preparation for the 
closure. Due to the length of the project 
and complexity and uncertainty 
regarding the project schedule, the Coast 
Guard is unable to provide this detailed 
information at this time. However, the 
Coast Guard will work closely with the 
project managers to ensure the public 
and waterway users are notified well in 
advance of any closure that will prohibit 
vessel navigation on the waterway. The 
Coast Guard will provide advance 
notice to the public through Broadcast 
Notices to Mariners (BNMs), Local 
Notices to Mariners (LNMs), and the 
Vessel Traffic Service (VTS). 
The Coast Guard is also making two 
clarifying changes to the regulatory text. 
In paragraph (c)(1), the phrase ‘‘while 
overhead bridge construction or 
demolition activities are occurring’’ has 
been deleted. Also in paragraph (d), the 
sentence ‘‘[t]hat date should include 
some margin for error in case of 
delays[,]’’ was also deleted. Although 
not requested or commented upon, the 
Coast Guard believes these changes in 
the regulatory text will prevent potential 
confusion regarding times when the 
safety zone is activated. As written now, 
the regulatory text clearly states that 
Coast Guard will provide advance 
notice to the public of the specific 
enforcement times and areas within the 
zone, which will depend on 
construction or demolition activities. 
There are no other changes in the 
regulatory text of this rule from the 
proposed rule in the NPRM. 
This rule establishes a safety zone 
from December 22, 2025 through March 
1, 2030. That date should include some 
margin for error in case of delays. 
Specific enforcement times and areas 
within the zone will depend on 
construction or demolition activities. 
The safety zone covers all navigable 
waters within the area encompassed by 
a line connecting the following points 
on the north and south shore of the 
Houston Ship Channel around the 
Beltway 8 Bridge (Sam Houston Tollway 
Ship Channel Bridge): Point 1 is the 
southeast corner at 29°44.033 N 95°8.733 W; thence west to Point 2 at 29°44.100 N 95°8.833 W; thence north to Point 3 at 29°44.267 N 95°8.817 W; thence east to Point 4 at 29°44.267 N 95°8.717 W; thence south returning to Point 1. No vessel or person is permitted 
to enter the safety zone without 
obtaining permission from the COTP or 
their designated representative. 
IV. Regulatory Analyses 
We developed this rule after 
considering numerous statutes and 
Executive orders related to rulemaking. 
Below we summarize our analyses 
based on a number of these statutes and 
Executive orders. 
A. Impact on Small Entities 
The Coast Guard certifies that, 
although some small entities may intend 
to transit the safety zone above, this rule 
will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities, as mandated by the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601– 
612 for the following reasons. During 
the times of overhead construction 
outside of the federal channel, vessels 
will still be allowed to transit under the 
bridge only within the federal channel. 
The channel will be closed for a short 
period when the construction or 
demolition is actively occurring over the 
main federal channel, and these 
closures will be coordinated between 
stakeholders, the construction 
contractor and Sector Houston- 
Galveston. The Coast Guard will work 
closely with the project managers to 
ensure the public and waterway users 
are notified well in advance of any 
closure that will prohibit vessel 
navigation on the main federal channel. 
While this zone will be in effect for 
several years, the Coast Guard (CG) 
anticipates that the main federal 
channel will remain open for the 
majority of the effective period. 
Under section 213(a) of the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104–121), 
if this rule will affect your small 
business, organization, or governmental 
jurisdiction and you have questions, 
contact the person listed in the 
FOR 
FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACTsection. 
Small businesses may send comments 
to the Small Business and Agriculture 
Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman 
and the Regional Small Business 
Regulatory Fairness Boards by calling 1– 
888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734–3247). 
B. Collection of Information 
This rule will not call for a new 
collection of information under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3501–3520). 
C. Federalism and Indian Tribal 
Governments 
We have analyzed this rule under 
Executive Order 13132, Federalism, and 
have determined that it is consistent 
with the fundamental federalism 
principles and preemption requirements 
described in that Order. 
Also, this rule does not have tribal 
implications under Executive Order 
13175, Consultation and Coordination 
with Indian Tribal Governments, 
because it does not have a substantial 
direct effect on one or more Indian 
tribes, on the relationship between the 
Federal Government and Indian tribes, 
or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities between the Federal 
Government and Indian tribes. 
D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
As required by The Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 
1531–1538), the Coast Guard certifies 
that this rule will not result in an 
annual expenditure of $100,000,000 or 
more (adjusted for inflation) by a State, 
local, or tribal government, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector. 
E. Environment 
We have analyzed this rule under 
Department of Homeland Security 
Directive 023–01, Rev. 1, associated 
implementing instructions, and 
Environmental Planning COMDTINST 
5090.1 (series), which guide the Coast 
Guard in complying with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 
U.S.C. 4321–4370f), and have 
determined that this action is one of a 
category of actions that do not 
individually or cumulatively have a 
significant effect on the human 
environment.

AGENCY: Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security. 
ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for 
all navigable waters within a 500-foot 
radius of 38°1211.1 N, 92°3759.4 W, at Mile Marker 0.2 on the Lake of the 
Ozarks. The safety zone is needed to 
protect personnel, vessels, and the 
marine environment from potential 
hazards created by a fireworks display. 
Entry of vessels or persons into this 
zone is prohibited unless specifically 
authorized by the Captain of the Port, 
Sector Upper Mississippi River. 
DATES: This rule is effective from 8:30 p.m. through 10 p.m. on December 31, 
2025.

FR Federal Register 
NPRM Notice of proposed rulemaking 
§ Section 
U.S.C. United States Code 
II. Background and Authority 
The Coast Guard received notification 
that fireworks will be launched from a 
barge on the Lake of the Ozarks at mile 
marker 0.2. Hazards from fireworks 
displays include accidental discharge of 
fireworks, dangerous projectiles, and 
falling hot embers or other debris. The 
Captain of the Port (COTP) Sector Upper 
Mississippi River has determined that 
potential hazards associated with 
fireworks are a safety concern for 
anyone within 500 feet of the fireworks 
display. Therefore, the COTP is issuing 
this rule under the authority in 46 
U.S.C. 70034, which is needed to 
protect personnel, vessels, and the 
marine environment in the navigable 
waters within the safety zone. 
The Coast Guard is issuing this rule 
without prior notice and comment. As 
is authorized by 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the 
Coast Guard finds that good cause exists 
for not publishing a notice of proposed 
rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this 
rule because it is impracticable and 
contrary to the public interest. We must 
establish this safety zone by December 
31, 2025, to protect personnel, vessels, 
and the marine environment. Therefore, 
we do not have enough time to solicit 
and respond to comments. 
For the same reasons, the Coast Guard 
finds that under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), good 
cause exists for making this rule 
effective less than 30 days after 
publication in the Federal Register. 
III. Discussion of the Rule 
This rule establishes a safety zone that 
will be enforced from 8:30 p.m. until 10 
p.m. on December 31, 2025. The safety 
zone will cover all navigable water 
within a 500-foot radius of the fireworks 
barge on Lake of the Ozarks, at 
38°1211.08 N, 92°3759.35 W. No vessel or person will be permitted to 
enter the safety zone without obtaining 
permission from the COTP or their 
designated representative. 
IV. Regulatory Analyses 
We developed this rule after 
considering numerous statutes and 
Executive orders related to rulemaking. 
Below we summarize our analyses 
based on a number of these statutes and 
Executive orders. 
A. Impact on Small Entities 
The regulatory flexibility analysis 
provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601–612, do not 
apply to rules that are not subject to 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:12 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\29DER1.SGM 29DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60579 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations notice and comment. Because the Coast 
Guard has, for good cause, waived the 
notice and comment requirement that 
would otherwise apply to this 
rulemaking, the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act’s flexibility analysis provisions do 
not apply here. 
Under section 213(a) of the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104–121), 
if this rule will affect your small 
business, organization, or governmental 
jurisdiction and you have questions, 
contact the person listed in the 
FOR 
FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACTsection. 
Small businesses may send comments 
to the Small Business and Agriculture 
Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman 
and the Regional Small Business 
Regulatory Fairness Boards by calling 1– 
888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734–3247). The 
Coast Guard will not retaliate against 
small entities that question or complain 
about this rule or any policy or action 
of the Coast Guard. 
B. Collection of Information 
This rule will not call for a new 
collection of information under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3501–3520). 
C. Federalism and Indian Tribal 
Governments 
We have analyzed this rule under 
Executive Order 13132, Federalism, and 
have determined that it is consistent 
with the fundamental federalism 
principles and preemption requirements 
described in that Order. 
Also, this rule does not have tribal 
implications under Executive Order 
13175, Consultation and Coordination 
with Indian Tribal Governments, 
because it does not have a substantial 
direct effect on one or more Indian 
tribes, on the relationship between the 
Federal Government and Indian tribes, 
or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities between the Federal 
Government and Indian tribes. 
D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
As required by The Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 
1531–1538), the Coast Guard certifies 
that this rule will not result in an 
annual expenditure of $100,000,000 or 
more (adjusted for inflation) by a State, 
local, or tribal government, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector. 
E. Environment 
We have analyzed this rule under 
Department of Homeland Security 
Directive 023–01, Rev. 1, associated 
implementing instructions, and 
Environmental Planning COMDTINST 
5090.1 (series), which guide the Coast 
Guard in complying with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 
U.S.C. 4321–4370f), and have 
determined that this action is one of a 
category of actions that do not 
individually or cumulatively have a 
significant effect on the human 
environment. 
This rule is a safety zone. It is 
categorically excluded from further 
review under paragraph L60(a) of 
Appendix A, Table 1 of DHS Instruction 
Manual 023–01–001–01, Rev. 1. A 
Record of Environmental Consideration 
supporting this determination is 
available in the docket.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 26, 2024, the Federal Maritime 
Commission (Commission) published a 
final rule entitled ‘‘Demurrage and 
Detention Billing Requirements’’ under 
the authority of the Ocean Shipping 
Reform Act of 2022, Public Law 117–14 
(June 16, 2022), 89 FR 14330. This rule 
established requirements for common 
carriers and marine terminal operators 
to include specific minimum 
information on demurrage and 
detention invoices, outlined certain 
detention and demurrage billing 
practices, such as determination of 
which parties may appropriately be 
billed for demurrage or detention 
charges, and set timeframes for issuing 
invoices, disputing charges with the 
billing party, and resolving such 
disputes.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES60580 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations carriers globally, filed a petition for 
review in the United States Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit, challenging the rule as arbitrary 
and capricious under the 
Administrative Procedure Act. On 
September 23, 2025, the Court held that 
one section of the rule, 46 CFR 541.4, 
‘‘is arbitrary and capricious because the 
Commission failed to explain the 
seeming inconsistency between its 
contractual-privity-based rationale and 
its categorical bar against billing motor 
carriers even when in privity with the 
billing party.’’ World Shipping Council 
v. Federal Maritime Commission, 152 F.4th 215, 220 (D.C. Cir. 2025). 
Accordingly, the court severed and set 
aside 46 CFR 541.4. Consistent with that 
decision, this rule removes 46 CFR 
541.4 from the Code of Federal 
Regulations. The other provisions of the 
rule remain in effect. 
The Commission is not required to 
provide notice and comment or delay 
the effective date of this rule. This rule 
is not subject to the requirement to 
provide public comment because it falls 
under the good cause exception at 5 
U.S.C. 553(b)(B). The good cause 
exception is satisfied when notice and 
comment is ‘‘impracticable, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public 
interest.’’ Notice and comment for this 
action would be unnecessary and 
contrary to the public interest. This rule 
is a necessary administrative step 
following the court’s order setting aside 
46 CFR 541.4. Per the court’s decision, 
section 541.4 has no legal effect. Public 
comment would not have any impact on 
the action. For those same reasons, and 
because this rule implements a court 
order already in effect, the Commission 
has good cause to waive the 30-day 
effective date under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). 
Delaying the ministerial act of removing 
the regulatory text in the Federal 
Register is contrary to the public interest because it could lead to 
confusion, particularly among the 
regulated public.

Agricultural Foreign Investment 
Disclosure Act: Revisions to Reporting 
Requirements 
AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
ACTION: Advanced notice of proposed rulemaking. 
SUMMARY: The Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978 
(AFIDA) implementing regulations 
establish requirements under which 
foreign persons must report interests in 
U.S. agricultural lands to the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
AFIDA regulations describe the type of 
interest in agricultural land a foreign 
person must have to trigger the 
reporting requirement, specific 
information that must be included in 
the report, and the mechanics of filing 
the report with USDA. AFIDA also 
requires some information about foreign 
persons who hold an interest in the 
agricultural land even though they may 
not own it directly, provided those 
foreign persons have ‘‘significant 
interest or substantial control’’ in the 
direct interest holder. USDA uses 
information from the filings to produce 
periodic reports to Congress on the 
effect that foreign ownership of U.S. 
agricultural land has on family farms 
and rural communities, and for other 
purposes. AFIDA regulations were last 
updated in 2006. Since that time, 
national security attention to foreign 
ownership or substantial control of 
agricultural land has increased. 
Committee on Foreign Investment in the 
United States (CFIUS) agencies, 
including the U.S. Department of 
Defense, use USDA information from 
AFIDA filings to identify and review 
transactions that may pose national 
security risks, such as the location of 
agricultural land near sensitive military 
bases. Recent analyses, including a 
report by the Government 
Accountability Office (GAO), have 
identified flaws in USDA’s processes for 
collecting, tracking, and sharing AFIDA 
data. These deficiencies, combined with 
evolving national security concerns and 
a Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
2023 requirement for USDA to develop 
a streamlined process for electronic 
submission and retention of AFIDA 
disclosures, lead USDA to examine 
AFIDA regulations and invite public 
input on changes that would improve 
information collection activities in a 
manner responsive to national security 
and the use of agricultural land. 
DATES: Comments must be received by January 28, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: USDA invites public comments on this Advance Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) and 
encourages stakeholders, including 
farmers, industry representatives, CFIUS 
and national security agencies and 
experts, and state and local 
governments, to provide input. 
Comments will be considered in the 
development of any future regulatory 
changes to ensure the regulations 
effectively address national security 
interests and the effects of foreign- 
owned agricultural land on rural 
communities. 
You may submit comments, identified 
by Docket ID: FSA–2024–0005, in the 
Federal eRulemaking Portal: http://

All comments will be posted without 
change and will be publicly available on

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Need for This Notice 
AFIDA requires foreign persons who 
acquire, transfer, or hold interests in 
U.S. agricultural land to report such 
transactions to the Secretary of 
Agriculture. The statute was enacted by 
Congress in 1978 and directed USDA to 
analyze information contained in the 
reports and determine the effects of 
reported transactions and holdings, 
particularly on family farms and rural 
communities, and for other purposes. 
Foreign holdings of U.S. agricultural 
land increased by an average of 0.6 
million acres per year from 2013 to 2017 
and by an average of 2.6 million acres 
per year from 2017 to 2023.
1
In 2023, 
Congress passed a Consolidated 
Appropriations Act that included a 
requirement for USDA to streamline its 
process for electronic submission and 
retention of AFIDA disclosures. This 
requirement accelerated USDA’s 
transition from paper AFIDA filings to 
the development of an online filing 
portal with document retention 
capability. And in 2024, GAO 
completed a report to Congressional 
Requesters, ‘‘Foreign Investments in 
U.S. Agricultural Land: Enhancing 
Efforts to Collect, Track, and Share Key 
Information Could Better Identify 
National Security Risks.’’ GAO found 
that USDA did not timely share data 
collected under AFIDA, and that at least 
one CFIUS member agency required 
AFIDA information more current and 
specific than USDA’s annual report to 
Congress. GAO provided six 
recommendations, including that USDA 
improve its verification and monitoring 
of collected AFIDA data and that USDA 
ensure its AFIDA reporting is complete, 
such as by incorporating country 
information from additional foreign 
persons beyond the primary investor 
when available. The increased interest 
in national security combined with 
multiple identified opportunities for 
improvement in AFIDA processes have 
led to this notice. 
USDA seeks input on regulatory or 
other changes that may improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of its 
AFIDA reporting and filing 
requirements. USDA is interested in 
comments on topics including the 
interests in agricultural land covered 
under AFIDA, identification of required 
filers, and the information included on

Overview of Key AFIDA Requirements 
Three requirement categories define 
the content and scope of an AFIDA 
filing: (1) Identification of foreign 
persons required to file; (2) The totality 
of information the filer is required to 
provide about the agricultural land; and 
(3) Information the filer is required to 
provide about other foreign persons 
with indirect interest in the agricultural 
land. Current AFIDA requirements and 
limitations are summarized below. 
Identification of Foreign Persons 
Required To File 
According to AFIDA regulations in 7 
CFR 781.3(b), ‘‘Any foreign person who 
held, holds, acquires, or transfers any 
interest in United States agricultural 
land is subject to the requirement of 
filing a report on form FSA–153’’ within 
90 days of acquiring the interest or 
becoming a foreign person. Section 
781.2 defines key terms. 
Broadly, a foreign person is a foreign 
government, a person (usually a legal 
entity) created or organized under the 
laws of a foreign government or that has 
its principal place of business outside 
the United States, or an individual who 
is not a citizen or national of the United 
States or its territories. The term also 
includes a person (usually a legal entity) 
created or organized under the laws of 
any state in which one of the previously 
listed categories of ‘‘foreign person’’ 
holds a significant interest or substantial 
control. ‘‘Any interest’’ generally means 
all interests acquired, transferred, or 
held in agricultural lands by a foreign 
person. However, the definition of ‘‘any 
interest’’ specifically excludes security 
interests, leases of less than ten years, 
contingent future interests, 
noncontingent future interests that do 
not become possessory upon the 
termination of the present possessory 
estate, surface or subsurface easements 
and rights-of-way used for a purpose 
unrelated to agricultural production, 
and an interest solely in mineral rights. 
Agricultural land is defined in section 
781.2(b) as ‘‘land in the United States 
used for forestry production and land in 
the United States currently used for, or, 
if currently idle, land last used within 
the past five years, for farming, 
ranching, or timber production, except 
land not exceeding ten acres in the 
aggregate, if the annual gross receipts 
from the sale of the farm, ranch, or 
timber products produced thereon do 
not exceed $1,000. Farming, ranching, 
or timber production includes, but is 
not limited to, activities set forth in the 
Standard Industrial Classification 
Manual (1987), Division A, exclusive of 
industry numbers 0711–0783, 0851, and 
0912–0919 which cover animal 
trapping, game management, hunting 
carried on as a business enterprise, 
trapping carried on as a business 
enterprise, and wildlife management. 
Land used for forestry production 
means, land exceeding 10 acres in 
which 10 percent is stocked by trees of 
any size, including land that formerly 
had such tree cover and that will be 
naturally or artificially regenerated.’’ 
Information the Filer Is Required To 
Provide About the Agricultural Land 
Section 781.3 describes the required 
content of an AFIDA report using the 
form FSA–153. While the current 
regulations require filings in the FSA 
county office local to the agricultural 
land, USDA is in the process of 
implementing an electronic filing 
process (‘‘on-line filing portal’’) as 
required by the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act of 2023. A foreign 
person required to submit a report must 
file a FSA–153 form report containing a 
list of items in section 781.3(e), 
including but not limited to legal name 
and address; citizenship, if an 
individual; type of interest in the land; 
the nature of the interest, name of the 
interest holder, country of creation or 
organization, and principal place of 
business if the foreign person is not a 
government or individual; a legal 
description of the agricultural land; the 
intended agricultural purpose of the 
land; the name, address, and 
relationship of any representative 
completing the FSA–153 form for the 
filer; how the tract of land was acquired

foreign person to the previous owner; 
and the date the interest in the land was 
acquired or transferred. 
Information the Filer Is Required To 
Provide About Other Foreign Persons 
With Indirect Interest in the 
Agricultural Land 
Section 781.3(f)(1) requires reporting 
by the filer on foreign persons who have 
a ‘‘significant interest or substantial 
control’’ in the filer. Any required filer, 
other than an individual or government, 
must also submit a report containing the 
legal name and the address of each 
foreign individual or government 
holding significant interest or 
substantial control in the filer. If the 
person holding significant interest or 
substantial control is an individual, the 
filer must also provide that individual’s 
citizenship. And, if the person holding 
significant interest or substantial control 
is a foreign person who is not also an 
individual or government, the filer must 
provide that foreign person’s name and 
nature of the interest held, the country 
in which the holder is created or 
organized, and the holder’s principal 
place of business. 
‘‘Significant interest or substantial 
control’’ is defined in section 781.2(k) as 
(1) an interest of 10 percent or more 
held by foreign person, by a single 
foreign individual, by a single foreign 
business, or by a single foreign 
government; (2) an interest of 10 percent 
or more held by a domestic entity in 
which a foreign person holds significant 
interest or substantial control, by foreign 
individuals, foreign entities, or by 
foreign governments, whenever such 
persons, individuals, or governments 
are acting in concert with respect to 
such interest even though no single 
individual, person, or government holds 
an interest of 10 percent or more; or (3) 
an interest of 50 percent or more, in the 
aggregate, held by a domestic entity in 
which a foreign person holds significant 
interest or substantial control, by foreign 
individuals, foreign entities, or by 
foreign governments, even though such 
individuals, persons, or governments 
may not be acting in concert.

under section 781.3(f) may then be

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS60583 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Proposed Rules interest holders. In short, the AFIDA 
regulation requires reporting by the 
foreign person who is the direct owner 
or lessee of the land and any foreign 
person who may be one or two tiers or 
levels above the direct owner or lessee 
in a chain of ownership or corporate 
relationship. 
Discussion and Identification of Topics 
for Comment 
USDA is aware of requirement gaps in 
the current AFIDA regulations and is 
considering how it may address those 
gaps in a manner that balances national 
security interests with other interests in 
U.S. agricultural land. Specifically, 
USDA notes multiple exclusions in the 
definitions of ‘‘agricultural land’’ and 
‘‘any interest’’ that may remove 
particular interests (for example, leases 
less than 10 years) from reporting 
requirements. Filers are only required to 
identify their land interest through a 
legal description and identification of 
acreage. In some instances, legal 
descriptions may be narratives 
referencing landmarks or natural 
features of the land with limited utility 
to those not actually present on the 
land. USDA does not receive or have 
sufficiently detailed information to 
create a geospatial map with property 
boundaries. 
While AFIDA does require a report on 
foreign persons who hold ‘‘significant 
interest or substantial interest’’ over 
direct interest holders, the definition of 
‘‘significant interest or substantial 
interest’’ is challenging to understand 
and apply, sets a high threshold (10 and 
50 percent), and treats countries with 
longstanding ties to the United States 
the same as countries designated as 
foreign adversaries by the Secretary of 
Commerce in 15 CFR 791.4(a). 
Furthermore, existing regulations only 
require filing by the foreign person who 
is the direct owner or lessee of the land 
and any foreign person who may be one 
or two tiers or levels above the direct 
owner or lessee in a chain of ownership 
or corporate relationship. USDA may 
affirmatively seek additional 
information from other interest holders 
named in reports, but it does not have 
the authority to request any additional 
detailed corporate structures or 
ownership information. Specifically, 
USDA lacks a mechanism to require 
additional detailed information about 
foreign interests throughout an 
ownership chain or in a complex 
corporate structure with multiple 
holding companies. USDA’s information 
deficit extends to the identity, country, 
and ownership interest of the ultimate 
foreign owner if that person is more 
than two or possibly three steps 
removed from the direct interest holder. 
USDA’s policy goal is to obtain 
valuable, comprehensive, and verifiable 
information about interests in U.S. 
agricultural land held by foreign 
persons. USDA is further interested in 
streamlining and strengthening AFIDA 
regulations to improve process 
efficiency, address national security 
interests, and provide timely, accurate, 
and detailed data for CFIUS agencies’ 
use. 
The following topics represent 
particular areas in which USDA is 
interested in receiving comments. 
However, USDA also invites 
commenters to address additional issues 
involving AFIDA, particularly as they 
relate to national security interests. 
Commenters are encouraged to be as 
specific as possible. Please include the 
rationale underlying any suggested 
changes. 
€Topic 1: Identification of foreign persons who are required to file reports 
using the FSA–153 form. Questions to 
consider when responding to this topic 
include the following: 
ÆThe definitions of ‘‘agricultural land,’’ ‘‘any interest,’’ and ‘‘foreign 
person’’ determine the universe of 
required filers. Are the definitions 
currently sufficient or are changes 
recommended? 
ÆShould USDA continue to treat foreign persons from countries 
designated as foreign adversaries the 
same as all other foreign persons with 
respect to the interest in agricultural 
land that triggers the filing requirement, 
or should different standards apply to 
foreign persons from countries 
designated as foreign adversaries? 
€Topic 2: Information the filer is required to provide about the 
agricultural land. Questions to consider 
when responding to this topic include 
the following: 
ÆShould filers be required to provide any additional information or 
documentation than the list of items in 
section 781.3(e)? If so, what additional 
information should USDA require and 
why? 
ÆHow can USDA best obtain a correct, verifiable description or 
geospatial map of the agricultural land 
that is broadly usable by a range of 
audiences? 
€Topic 3: Information the filer is required to provide about other foreign 
persons with indirect interest in the 
agricultural land. Questions to consider 
when responding to this topic include 
the following: 
ÆWhat information should USDA require about interest holders who are 
multiple steps removed from the direct 
interest holder or part of complex 
organizational structures? 
ÆHow can USDA best ensure that the information it receives is complete and 
verifiable?

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Introduction 
A. Background 
On February 23, 2021, the Board 
published a final rule amending various 
parts of the NCUA’s regulations to 
permit low-income designated credit 
unions, complex credit unions, and new 
credit unions to issue subordinated debt 
for purposes of regulatory capital 
treatment.
1
Among other changes, the 
final rule established a new § 701.25, 
governing loans by Federal Credit 
Unions (FCUs) to other credit unions. 
The regulation establishes an aggregate 
limit on such loans of 25 percent of the 
lending FCU’s paid-in and unimpaired 
capital and surplus. It also sets limits for 
loans to a single credit union borrower. 
The regulation sets forth specific 
eligibility requirements and aggregate 
limits for FCUs that invest in the 
Subordinated Debt of other credit 
unions. The requirements of § 701.25 
are made applicable to federally insured 
state-chartered credit unions (FISCUs) 
through § 741.227.
2
 
In addition to the limits discussed 
above, § 701.25 imposes documentation 
requirements on FCU boards of 
directors, and through § 741.227 on 
FISCU boards as well. Specifically, 
paragraph (b) of § 701.25 requires the 
board of directors to approve all loans 
to other credit unions and to establish 
written policies for managing the 
associated credit risk. The policies must 
specify the limits on the aggregate 
principal amount of loans the FICU can 
make to all other credit unions and the 
aggregate principal amount of loans the 
FICU can make to any single credit 
union. Such limits specific to the FICU 
may not exceed the generally applicable 
limits established in § 701.25. 
B. Legal Authority 
The Board is issuing this proposed 
rule pursuant to its authority under the 
Federal Credit Union Act (FCU Act).
3
 
Under the FCU Act, the NCUA is the 
chartering and supervisory authority for 
FCUs and the federal supervisory 
authority for FICUs. The FCU Act grants 
the NCUA a broad mandate to issue 
regulations governing both FCUs and 
FICUs. Section 120 of the FCU Act is a 
general grant of regulatory authority and 
authorizes the Board to prescribe 
regulations for the administration of the 
FCU Act.
4
Section 209 of the FCU Act 
is a plenary grant of regulatory authority 
to the NCUA to issue regulations 
necessary or appropriate to carry out its 
role as share insurer for all FICUs.
5
The 
FCU Act also includes an express grant 
of authority for the Board to subject 
federally chartered central, or corporate, 
credit unions to such rules, regulations, 
and orders as the Board deems 
appropriate.
6
 
II. Proposed Rule 
The Board proposes to remove 
§ 701.25(b). Upon reconsideration, the 
Board believes that the regulation is 
unnecessary and overly prescriptive. 
The FCU Act already requires a FCU’s 
board of directors to approve all loans 
to other credit unions.
7
Accordingly, for 
FCUs, § 701.25(b) is largely redundant 
of an existing statutory requirement. 
Moreover, FICU boards are in the best 
position to determine whether formal 
approval policies are necessary for such 
loans, consistent with the number, size, 
and risks associated with the FICU’s 
lending practices. Removing this 
regulation will provide FICUs with 
greater flexibility. The Board 
emphasizes that while the proposed rule 
would no longer require FICU boards to 
adopt written policies regarding 
aggregate limits on loans to other credit 
unions, FICUs remain subject to the 
limits and other requirements regarding 
such loans set forth in the other 
provisions of § 701.25. If the proposed 
rule is adopted, FISCUs would refer to 
state law to determine whether their 
boards must approve loans to other 
credit unions. 
III. Regulatory Procedures 
A. Providing Accountability Through 
Transparency Act of 2023 
The Providing Accountability 
Through Transparency Act of 2023 (5 
U.S.C. 553(b)(4)) requires that a notice 
of proposed rulemaking include the 
internet address of a summary of not 
more than 100 words in length of a 
proposed rule, in plain language, that 
shall be posted on the internet website 
under section 206(d) of the E- 
Government Act of 2002 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
note) (commonly known as 
regulations.gov). The Act, under its 
terms, applies to notices of proposed 
rulemaking and does not expressly 
include other types of documents that 
the Board publishes voluntarily for 
public comment, such as notices and 
interim-final rules that request comment 
despite invoking ‘‘good cause’’ to forgo 
such notice and public procedure. The 
Board, however, has elected to address 
the Act’s requirement in these types of 
documents in the interests of 
administrative consistency and 
transparency. The Board seeks comment 
on a proposed rule to remove the 
regulations related to approval and 
policies on making loans to other credit 
unions. While this provision will no 
longer be codified in regulation, Federal 
Credit Unions would remain subject to 
statutory requirements related to making 
loans to credit unions. Federally insured 
state-chartered credit unions would 
remain subject to any other applicable 
NCUA or state law or regulation. 
The proposal and the required 
summary can be found at https://
www.regulations.gov. 
B. Executive Orders 12866, 13563, and 
14192 
Pursuant to Executive Order 12866 
(‘‘Regulatory Planning and Review’’), as 
amended by Executive Order 14215, a 
determination must be made whether a 
regulatory action is significant and 
therefore subject to review by the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) in 
accordance with the requirements of the 
Executive Order.

Executive Order 
13563 (‘‘Improving Regulation and 
Regulatory Review’’) supplements and 
reaffirms the principles, structures, and 
definitions governing contemporary 
regulatory review established in 
Executive Order 12866.
9
This proposed 
rule was drafted and reviewed in 
accordance with Executive Order 12866 
and Executive Order 13563. OMB has 
determined that this proposed rule is 
not a ‘‘significant regulatory action’’ as

defined in section 3(f)(1) of Executive 
Order 12866. Further, this proposed rule 
to remove the regulations requiring that 
a FICU board of directors adopt 
minimum approval and written policy 
standards regarding loans to other credit 
unions is consistent with Executive 
Order 13563. 
Executive Order 14192 (‘‘Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation’’) 
requires that any new incremental costs 
associated with new regulations shall, to 
the extent permitted by law, be offset by 
the elimination of existing costs 
associated with at least 10 prior 
regulations.
10
This proposed rule is 
expected to be a deregulatory action 
under Executive Order 14192. 
C. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act
11
 
generally requires an agency to conduct 
a regulatory flexibility analysis of any 
rule subject to notice and comment 
rulemaking requirements, unless the 
agency certifies that the rule will not 
have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities. If 
the agency makes such a certification, it 
shall publish the certification at the 
time of publication of either the 
proposed rule or the final rule, along 
with a statement providing the factual 
basis for such certification.
12
For 
purposes of this analysis, the NCUA 
considers small credit unions to be 
those having under $100 million in 
assets.
13
The Board fully considered the 
potential economic impacts of the 
regulatory amendments on small credit 
unions. 
To the extent that the proposed rule 
would have any economic impacts, they 
will be deregulatory in nature. The 
proposed rule would remove the 
requirement that FICU boards adopt 
minimum approval and written policy 
standards regarding loans to other credit 
unions. While these documentation 
requirements might impose some 
economic costs on FICUs, they are 
unlikely to be significant. Accordingly, 
any impacts associated with their 
rescission are also unlikely to impose a 
significant economic burden. 
Accordingly, the NCUA certifies the 
proposed rule would not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small credit 
unions. 
D. Paperwork Reduction Act 
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(PRA) generally provides that an agency 
may not conduct or sponsor, and not 
withstanding any other provision of 
law, a person is not required to respond 
to, a collection of information, unless it 
displays a currently valid Office of 
Management and Budget control 
number. The PRA applies to 
rulemakings in which an agency creates 
a new or amends existing information 
collection requirements. For purposes of 
the PRA, an information-collection 
requirement may take the form of a 
reporting, recordkeeping, or a third- 
party disclosure requirement. The 
information collection requirements 
contained in Part 701.25(b) are 
approved by OMB under OMB Control 
Number 3133–0207 with a current 
expiration date of October 31, 2025. 
The proposed rule would revise the 
following information collection 
requirement(s): Removal of the Policies 
for loans to credit unions—12 CFR 
701.25(b). 
Upon the publication of the final rule 
in the Federal Register, as applicable, 
the NCUA will submit a request to OMB 
to revise OMB Control Number 3133– 
0207. The proposed rescission of these 
regulations, along with the information 
collection requirement(s) contained 
therein and the revision of OMB Control 
Number 3133–0207, would reduce 
public information collection burden by 
an estimated 1,650 annual burden 
hours. 
If you want to comment on the 
proposed rescission of the information- 
collection requirements that would 
result from this proposed rule, please 
send your comments and suggestions on 
this proposed action as previously 
described in the 
DATESand ADDRESSES 
sections. 
E. Executive Order 13132 on Federalism 
Executive Order 13132 encourages 
certain regulatory agencies to consider 
the impact of their actions on state and 
local interests. The NCUA, an agency as 
defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5), complies 
with the executive order to adhere to 
fundamental federalism principles. This 
proposed rule applies to FCUs and to 
FISCUs. The rulemaking may, therefore, 
have some direct effect on the states, the 
relationship between the national 
government and the states, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. However, to the 
extent the rule has any such effects, it 
will be to relieve FISCUs of regulatory 
burden. The proposed rule would 
remove the requirement that FICU 
boards adopt minimum approval and 
written policy standards regarding loans 
to other credit unions. The NCUA 
welcomes comments on ways to 
eliminate, or at least minimize, any 
potential impact in this area. 
F. Assessment of Federal Regulations 
and Policies on Families 
The NCUA has determined that this 
proposed rule would not affect family 
well-being within the meaning of 
section 654 of the Treasury and General 
Government Appropriations Act, 
1999.
14
The proposed regulatory 
requirements are exclusively concerned 
with the adoption of written policies by 
FICUs regarding loans to other credit 
unions. The potential positive effect on 
family well-being, including financial 
well-being, is, at most, indirect.

Suretyship and Guaranty; Segregated

AGENCY: National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). 
ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The NCUA Board (Board) seeks comment on a proposed rule to 
remove the segregated deposit and 
collateral requirements when a federally 
insured credit union (FICU) acts as a 
surety and guarantor. Removing this 
regulation will provide FICUs with 
greater flexibility to design products 
that meet member needs. FICUs would 
remain subject to the other requirements 
regarding surety and guaranty 
agreements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Introduction 
A. Background 
Federal Credit Unions (FCUs) may 
only engage in activities that are 
expressly authorized either by statute or 
within the FCU’s incidental powers. 
The Federal Credit Union Act (FCU Act) 
explicitly grants FCUs the power to, 
among other activities, make loans to 
members and to provide letters of credit 
on behalf of members.
1
The 
accompanying incidental powers 
provision states that each FCU may 
‘‘exercise such incidental powers as 
shall be necessary or requisite to enable 
it to carry on effectively the business for 
which it is incorporated.’’
2
The FCU 
Act defines the business for which each 
FCU is incorporated: ‘‘promoting thrift 
among its members and creating a 
source of credit for provident or 
productive purposes.’’
3
Section 701.20, 
established in 2004, recognizes the 
ability of FCUs to enter into suretyship 
and guaranty agreements for their 
members as an incidental power, 
providing additional flexibility to meet 
member needs.
4
For example, the 
regulation allows FCUs to become one 
party in a three-way lending 
relationship, where the FCU agrees to 
take responsibility for repayment if the 
member is unable to meet the lending 
obligation. 
Section 701.20 defines these 
arrangements and, to promote safety and 
soundness, requires that the FCU’s 
obligation be for a fixed amount and 
duration, that the FCU’s performance of 
the agreement creates an authorized 
loan that complies with the applicable 
lending regulations, and that it obtains 
a segregated deposit from the member 
sufficient to cover the potential liability. 
As provided in § 741.221 of the NCUA 
regulations, these requirements also 
apply to federally insured state credit 
unions (FISCUs) that are authorized 
under state law to enter into suretyship 
and guaranty agreements.
5
The rule was 
amended in 2019 as part of a regulatory 
reform initiative to reduce burden and 
improve clarity by updating internal 
cross-references.
6
 
B. Legal Authority 
The Board has the legal authority to 
issue this proposed rule pursuant to its 
plenary rulemaking authority under the 
FCU Act and its specific rulemaking 
authority under the various acts the 
Board administers.
7
Under the FCU Act, 
the NCUA is the chartering and 
supervisory authority for FCUs and the 
federal supervisory authority for 
FICUs.
8
The FCU Act grants the NCUA 
a broad mandate to issue regulations 
governing both FCUs and all FICUs. 
Section 120 of the FCU Act is a general 
grant of regulatory authority and 
authorizes the Board to prescribe rules 
and regulations for the administration of 
the FCU Act.
9
Section 207 of the FCU 
Act is a specific grant of authority over 
share insurance coverage, 
conservatorships, and liquidations.
10
 
Section 209 of the FCU Act is a plenary 
grant of regulatory authority to the 
Board to issue rules and regulations 
necessary or appropriate to carry out its 
role as share insurer for all FICUs.
11
 
Accordingly, the FCU Act grants the 
Board broad rulemaking authority to 
ensure that the credit union industry 
and the National Credit Union Share 
Insurance Fund remain safe and sound. 
II. Proposed Rule 
As part of its deregulatory initiative, 
the Board proposes to remove 
paragraphs (c)(3) and (d) of § 701.20, 
which impose segregated deposit and 
collateral requirements when FICUs act 
as a surety and guarantor. Under these 
provisions, depending on the nature of 
the collateral, an FCU must have a 
perfected security interest in collateral 
equal to 100 or 110 percent of the 
obligation. The 100 percent collateral 
category includes cash; obligations of 
the United States or its agencies; 
obligations fully guaranteed by the 
United States or its agencies as to 
principal and interest; and notes, drafts, 
bills of exchange, and bankers’ 
acceptances that are eligible for 
rediscount or purchase by a Federal 
Reserve Bank.
12
The 110 percent 
collateral category includes real estate 
and marketable securities.
13
Section 
741.221 of the NCUA regulations 
applies these requirements to FISCUs

regulator may adopt state-specific rules if the state 
rule covers at least all provisions in part 723 and 
is no less restrictive as determined by the NCUA. 
FISCUs in states with an NCUA-approved state rule 
may comply with the state rule and need not 
comply with part 723. See 12 CFR 723.10, 741.203.

that are authorized under state law to 
act as a surety or guarantor. 
The Board is now of the view that 
removing these segregated deposit and 
collateral requirements will provide 
FICUs the flexibility to design products 
that meet member needs. These 
proposed changes are intended to 
simplify the regulatory framework and 
reduce unnecessary compliance 
burdens. 
It is not always necessary to have a 
segregated deposit that fully covers the 
liability. For example, current 
regulations require a FICU acting as a 
surety or guarantor to create an 
authorized loan that complies with the 
applicable NCUA lending regulations.
14
 
The NCUA’s commercial lending 
regulations adopted in 2016 include 
collateral requirements that reflect a 
broad principles-based regulatory 
approach for FICUs engaged in member 
business lending activities.
15
These 
principles are predicated on the Board’s 
expectation that credit unions will 
maintain prudent risk management 
practices and sufficient capital to 
mitigate the risks associated with their 
commercial lending activities.
16
 
Maintaining this additional requirement 
for a segregated deposit associated with 
suretyship or guaranty agreements adds 
complexity to these transactions. FICUs 
are best positioned to determine the 
amount and types of collateral they are 
willing to accept to cover the risk. 
The Board invites comment on all 
aspects of this proposed rule. 
III. Regulatory Procedures 
A. Providing Accountability Through 
Transparency Act of 2023 
The Providing Accountability 
Through Transparency Act of 2023 (5 
U.S.C. 553(b)(4)) (Act) requires that a 
notice of proposed rulemaking include 
the internet address of a summary of not 
more than 100 words in length of a 
proposed rule, in plain language, that 
shall be posted on the internet website 
under section 206(d) of the E- 
Government Act of 2002 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
note) (commonly known as 
regulations.gov). The Act, under its 
terms, applies to notices of proposed 
rulemaking and does not expressly 
include other types of documents that 
the Board publishes voluntarily for 
public comment, such as notices and 
interim-final rules that request comment 
despite invoking ‘‘good cause’’ to forgo 
such notice and public procedure. The 
Board, however, has elected to address 
the Act’s requirement in these types of 
documents in the interests of 
administrative consistency and 
transparency. In summary, the Board 
seeks comment on a proposed rule to 
remove the segregated deposit and 
collateral requirements when a FICU 
acts as a surety and guarantor. 
Removing this regulation will give 
FICUs the flexibility to design products 
that meet member needs. FICUs would 
remain subject to the other requirements 
regarding surety and guaranty 
agreements. 
The proposal and the required 
summary can be found at https://
www.regulations.gov. 
B. Executive Orders 12866, 13563, and 
14192 
Pursuant to Executive Order 12866 
(‘‘Regulatory Planning and Review’’), as 
amended by Executive Order 14215, a 
determination must be made whether a 
regulatory action is significant and 
therefore subject to review by the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) in 
accordance with the requirements of the 
Executive Order.
17
Executive Order 
13563 (‘‘Improving Regulation and 
Regulatory Review’’) supplements and 
reaffirms the principles, structures, and 
definitions governing contemporary 
regulatory review established in 
Executive Order 12866.
18
This proposed 
rule was drafted and reviewed in 
accordance with Executive Order 12866 
and Executive Order 13563. This 
proposed rule will reduce a burden by 
removing the segregated deposit and 
collateral requirements for FICU 
suretyship and guaranty arrangements 
and is consistent with Executive Order 
13563. OMB has determined that this 
proposed rule is not a ‘‘significant 
regulatory action’’ as defined in section 
3(f) of Executive Order 12866. 
Executive Order 14192 (‘‘Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation’’) 
requires that any new incremental costs 
associated with new regulations shall, to 
the extent permitted by law, be offset by 
the elimination of existing costs 
associated with at least 10 prior 
regulations.
19
This proposed rule is 
expected to be a deregulatory action for 
purposes of Executive Order 14192. 
C. The Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act
20
 
generally requires an agency to conduct 
a regulatory flexibility analysis of any 
rule subject to notice and comment 
rulemaking requirements, unless the 
agency certifies that the rule will not 
have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities. If 
the agency makes such a certification, it 
shall publish the certification at the 
time of publication of either the 
proposed rule or the final rule, along 
with a statement providing the factual 
basis for such certification.
21
For 
purposes of this analysis, the NCUA 
considers small credit unions to be 
those having under $100 million in 
assets.
22
The Board fully considered the 
potential economic impacts of the 
regulatory amendments on small credit 
unions. 
To the extent that the proposed rule 
would have any economic impacts, they 
will be deregulatory in nature. The 
current rule authorizes FCUs to enter 
into suretyship and guaranty 
agreements. The proposed rule would 
remove the segregated deposit and 
collateral requirements for FCUs to 
enter into such agreements. To the 
extent FISCUs are authorized to enter 
into surety and guaranty agreements 
under state law, FISCUs would similarly 
benefit from the removal. It is unlikely 
that small credit unions will participate 
in either of these activities. While these 
requirements might impose some 
economic costs or create an economic 
benefit for FICUs, they are unlikely to be 
significant. 
Accordingly, the NCUA certifies the 
proposed rule would not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small credit 
unions. 
D. Paperwork Reduction Act 
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(PRA) generally provides that an agency 
may not conduct or sponsor, and not 
withstanding any other provision of 
law, a person is not required to respond 
to, a collection of information, unless it 
displays a currently valid Office of 
Management and Budget control 
number. The PRA applies to 
rulemakings in which an agency creates 
a new or amends existing information 
collection requirements. For purposes of 
the PRA, an information-collection 
requirement may take the form of a 
reporting, recordkeeping, or a third- 
party disclosure requirement. The 
NCUA has determined that the changes

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS60588 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Proposed Rules addressed in this notice do not create a 
new information collection or revise an 
existing information collection as 
defined by the PRA. 
E. Executive Order 13132 on Federalism 
Executive Order 13132 encourages 
certain agencies to consider the impact 
of their actions on state and local 
interests. The NCUA, an agency as 
defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5), voluntarily 
complies with the executive order to 
adhere to fundamental federalism 
principles. This proposed rule would 
apply to all FICUs, including FISCUs. 
The NCUA expects that any effect on 
states or on the distribution of power 
and responsibilities among the various 
levels of government will be minor. 
These proposed changes are not 
intended to affect the division of 
responsibilities between the NCUA and 
state regulatory authorities with 
oversight of FISCUs. The proposed rule 
would remove the segregated deposit 
and collateral requirements imposed by 
§ 701.20 when FCUs or FISCUs act as a 
surety and guarantor. FISCUs would 
remain subject to the other 
requirements, including compliance 
with applicable NCUA and state lending 
regulations. 
The proposed rulemaking may, 
therefore, have some direct effect on the 
states, the relationship between the 
national government and the states, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. However, to the 
extent the rule has any such effects, it 
will be to relieve FISCUs of a regulatory 
burden. 
F. Assessment of Federal Regulations 
and Policies on Families 
The NCUA has determined that this 
proposed rule would not affect family 
well-being within the meaning of 
section 654 of the Treasury and General 
Government Appropriations Act, 1999. 
The proposed rule relates to the 
collateral requirements for FICUs to 
enter into surety and guaranty 
agreements, and any effect on family 
well-being is expected to be indirect. 
The proposed regulatory changes are 
exclusively concerned with removing 
the unnecessary segregated deposit and 
collateral requirements specific to such 
agreements. Any potential positive 
effect on family well-being, including 
financial well-being is, at most, indirect.

76 FR 30521 (May 26, 2011). 
I. Introduction 
A. Background 
The Board comprehensively revised 
and streamlined part 740 in a 2003 final 
rule.
1
The primary purpose of the 2003 
revision was to modernize the 
regulation for clarity, address the 
growing use of the internet for member 
transactions, and clarify the use of trade 
names in advertising. The NCUA’s goal 
was to ensure members were adequately 
informed of their federal share 
insurance coverage while imposing a 
minimal regulatory burden. 
Over the subsequent years, the NCUA 
amended these regulations several 
times. In the 2006 final rule, the NCUA 
revised the official sign to reflect 
statutory changes from the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005, 
which included adding a statement that 
insured accounts are backed by the full 
faith and credit of the United States 
Government. 
A subsequent 2008 final rule provided 
credit unions with additional flexibility 
by permitting the use of a shortened 
advertising statement, ‘‘Federally 
insured by NCUA,’’ or the official sign 
itself in advertisements.
2
In a 2011 final 
rule, the Board made the advertising 
rules more stringent.
3
This amendment, 
among other changes, reduced the time 
exemption for radio and television 
advertisements from 30 seconds to 15 
seconds. It also introduced the 
requirement to include the official 
advertising statement in annual reports 
and statements of condition, clarified 
that the statement’s font size in print 
must be no smaller than the smallest 
font used for other consumer 
information, and defined the term 
‘‘advertisement’’ for the first time. 
However, in a 2018 final rule, the 
NCUA reversed the 2011 change to the 
broadcast advertisement exemption to 
provide regulatory relief and restore 
parity with regulations for banks 
insured by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation.
4
The 2018 rule 
expanded the radio and television 
exemption back to 30 seconds and 
introduced a shorter advertising 
statement option: ‘‘Insured by NCUA.’’ 
Most recently, a 2020 final rule made 
technical corrections to improve 
clarity.
5
 
B. Legal Authority 
Section 205(a) of the Federal Credit 
Union Act (FCU Act) (12 U.S.C. 1785(a)) 
requires each FICU to display a sign 
relating to the insurance of its share 
accounts.
6
The NCUA implements this 
requirement in part 740 of its rules (part 
740).
7
Part 740 also requires that each 
FICU include an official advertising 
statement related to share insurance in 
all advertisements.
8
This requirement 
originated from a historic statutory 
provision in section 1785(a). Before 
2005, section 1785(a) required every 
FICU to include a statement in all 
advertisements reiterating that its 
member accounts are insured by the 
Board. Section 1785(a) also provided 
that the Board may exempt 
advertisements from this requirement if 
the advertisements do not relate to 
member accounts or when it is 
impractical to include such a statement. 
The 2005 statutory amendment 
retained the requirement for FICUs to 
post official signs but removed the 
requirement to include official 
advertising statements. The NCUA 
issued a final rule implementing 
changes associated with the 2005 
statutory amendments in 2006 (2006 
final rule) but did not remove the 
portions of part 740 that implemented 
the historical requirement to include an 
official advertising statement.
9
Part 740 
currently includes both the 
requirements for an official sign and 
advertising statement.
10
 
II. Proposed Rule 
This proposed rule would amend two 
sections within part 740 and is intended 
to promote regulatory efficiency and 
reduce unnecessary burdens on FICUs. 
This proposed rule would remove 
§ 740.5 related to the official advertising 
statement and revise § 740.0 to remove 
references to the official advertising 
statement. This action is intended to 
provide FICUs with greater flexibility in 
their advertising activities while 
ensuring that members continue to 
receive clear and accurate information 
about their share insurance coverage 
through other required disclosures. 
Section 740.5 establishes the specific 
requirements for the official advertising 
statement. It mandates that FICUs 
include one of three prescribed official 
statements or an alternative, namely— 
‘‘This credit union is federally insured 
by the National Credit Union 
Administration,’’ ‘‘Federally insured by 
NCUA,’’ ‘‘Insured by NCUA,’’ or a 
reproduction of the official sign—in all 
advertisements, unless specifically 
exempted. The regulation requires the 
statement to be clearly legible and with 
a font that is no smaller than the 
smallest font used for other consumer 
information in the advertisement. 
Section 740.5 also details numerous 
exemptions, specifying that the official 
statement is not required for certain 
items such as stationery, checks, signs 
within a credit union’s office, directory 
listings, radio and television 
advertisements of 30 seconds or less, 
promotional items where inclusion is 
impractical, and advertisements that do 
not relate to member accounts, such as 
those for loans or safe deposit box 
services. 
The Board is proposing to eliminate 
§ 740.5 because the section imposes an 
unnecessary and undue compliance 
burden on FICUs that is 
disproportionate to its limited public 
benefit. The highly prescriptive nature 
of the rule, with its specific textual 
requirements and complex list of 
exceptions for items ranging from radio 
spots to promotional pens, forces FICUs 
to dedicate administrative resources to 
compliance. This approach is inflexible 
and poorly suited to the modern, fast- 
paced advertising landscape, 
particularly in the context of digital and 
social media, where space is often 
limited and communication must be 
concise. 
Furthermore, the Board believes the 
rule is largely unnecessary because its 
core objective—ensuring members are 
aware of their federal insurance 
coverage—is effectively achieved 
through other, more direct means. The 
NCUA has long held it is important for 
consumers of advertisements to know 
that the share accounts in the 
advertising FICU are federally insured 
by the NCUA.
11
The Board has also 
stated that it believes the benefits to 
consumers and FICUs—namely, 
enhanced consumer confidence and 
agency name recognition—outweigh the 
relatively minor burden associated with

The Board notes that it treats mobile banking 
applications similar to internet pages and the 
official sign is required on the main page and the 
log-on screen where members identify themselves 
to conduct transactions online. The official sign is 
also required on a membership application page. 
Displaying the official sign there will provide 
adequate notice of federal share insurance to the 
member.

requiring the inclusion of the official 
advertising statement. 
However, the Board now believes 
these objectives are best met through 
other provisions of part 740, and the 
advertising statement is unnecessary. 
First, the requirements in § 740.4, which 
are not being amended by this rule, 
mandate the display of the official 
NCUA sign in a FICU’s offices and on 
its website where members can open 
share accounts and deposit funds.
12
 
This ensures that members receive 
prominent notice of their insured status 
at the key points of transaction and 
interaction. Second, the requirements in 
§ 740.2 mandate that FICU advertising 
be accurate and truthful. This provision 
ensures that, if a FICU references its 
federal share insurance in 
advertisements, it does so accurately. 
For example, if a FICU states it is NCUA 
insured in an advertisement that 
includes noninsured products, the 
advertisement should be clear that the 
product is not insured. The additional 
requirement to include a specific 
statement in all advertisements on share 
insurance is therefore redundant and 
does not materially enhance member 
protection in a way that justifies the 
associated compliance costs. 
This policy to remove the requirement 
for an official advertising statement is 
also supported by the fact that the 
requirement in § 740.5 is not statutorily 
mandated. As discussed above, the FCU 
Act explicitly directs the Board to issue 
regulations regarding the display of the 
official sign. No provision in the FCU 
Act compels the Board to create or 
enforce a separate, distinct official 
advertising statement to be included in 
all advertisements. As the rule is not 
required by law and imposes an 
unnecessary burden, its removal is a 
logical step to streamline the regulatory 
framework. FICUs may continue to 
include an advertising statement, 
provided the inclusion is not inaccurate 
or deceptive, but will not be required to 
include an advertising statement. 
Finally, the proposed rule would also 
amend § 740.0, which outlines the scope 
of part 740. Part 740 currently 
references the official advertising 
statement. With the removal of the 
substantive requirements in § 740.5, 
retaining a scope section that references 
these rules would be inaccurate and 
create confusion. Therefore, the 
proposed rule would remove references 
in § 740.0 to the advertising statement. 
The Board solicits comments on all 
aspects of the proposed rule. 
III. Regulatory Procedures 
A. Providing Accountability Through 
Transparency Act of 2023 
The Providing Accountability 
Through Transparency Act of 2023 (5 
U.S.C. 553(b)(4)) (Act) requires that a 
notice of proposed rulemaking include 
the internet address of a summary of not 
more than 100 words in length of a 
proposed rule, in plain language, that 
shall be posted on the internet website 
under section 206(d) of the E- 
Government Act of 2002 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
note) (commonly known as 
regulations.gov). The Act, under its 
terms, applies to notices of proposed 
rulemaking and does not expressly 
include other types of documents that 
the Board publishes voluntarily for 
public comment, such as notices and 
interim-final rules that request comment 
despite invoking ‘‘good cause’’ to forgo 
such notice and public procedure. The 
Board, however, has elected to address 
the Act’s requirement in these types of 
documents in the interests of 
administrative consistency and 
transparency. 
The Board is issuing this proposed 
rule to streamline its regulations 
governing advertising and the notice of 
insured status. This proposed rule 
would eliminate provisions concerning 
the official advertising statement. This 
action is undertaken to reduce 
regulatory complexity and the intended 
effect is to reduce the administrative 
burden and costs for FICUs and provide 
them with greater flexibility in their 
advertising activities. 
The proposal and the required 
summary can be found at https://
www.regulations.gov. 
B. Executive Orders 12866, 13563, and 
14192 
Pursuant to Executive Order 12866 
(‘‘Regulatory Planning and Review’’), as 
amended by Executive Order 14215, a 
determination must be made whether a 
regulatory action is significant and 
therefore subject to review by the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) in 
accordance with the requirements of the 
Executive Order.
13
Executive Order 
13563 (‘‘Improving Regulation and 
Regulatory Review’’) supplements and 
reaffirms the principles, structures, and 
definitions governing contemporary 
regulatory review established in 
Executive Order 12866.
14
This proposed 
rule was drafted and reviewed in 
accordance with Executive Order 12866 
and Executive Order 13563. OMB has 
determined that this proposed rule is 
not a ‘‘significant regulatory action’’ as 
defined in section 3(f)(1) of Executive 
Order 12866. This proposed rule will 
reduce the burden of including an 
official advertising statement on all 
advertisements unless otherwise exempt 
and is consistent with Executive Order 
13563. 
Executive Order 14192 (‘‘Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation’’) 
requires that any new incremental costs 
associated with new regulations shall, to 
the extent permitted by law, be offset by 
the elimination of existing costs 
associated with at least 10 prior 
regulations.
15
This proposed rule is 
expected to be a deregulatory action for 
purposes of Executive Order 14192. 
C. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act
16
 
generally requires an agency to conduct 
a regulatory flexibility analysis of any 
rule subject to notice and comment 
rulemaking requirements, unless the 
agency certifies that the rule will not 
have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities. If 
the agency makes such a certification, it 
shall publish the certification at the 
time of publication of either the 
proposed rule or the final rule, along 
with a statement providing the factual 
basis for such certification.
17
For 
purposes of this analysis, the NCUA 
considers small credit unions to be 
those having under $100 million in 
assets.
18
The Board fully considered the 
potential economic impacts of the 
regulatory amendments on small credit 
unions. 
This rule is narrow in scope and 
purely deregulatory. Further, FICUs may 
voluntarily continue to include the 
official advertising statement in their 
advertisements and may choose not to 
change their current practices. 
Accordingly, the NCUA certifies the 
proposed rule would not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small credit 
unions. 
D. Paperwork Reduction Act 
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(PRA) generally provides that an agency 
may not conduct or sponsor, and not 
withstanding any other provision of

Catastrophic Act Preparedness Guidelines. The 
Continued 
law, a person is not required to respond 
to, a collection of information, unless it 
displays a currently valid Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) control 
number. The PRA applies to 
rulemakings in which an agency creates 
a new or amends existing information 
collection requirements. For purposes of 
the PRA, an information-collection 
requirement may take the form of a 
reporting, recordkeeping, or a third- 
party disclosure requirement. The 
NCUA has determined that the changes 
described in this notice do not create a 
new information collection or revise an 
existing information collection as 
defined by the PRA. 
E. Executive Order 13132 on Federalism 
Executive Order 13132 encourages 
certain agencies to consider the impact 
of their actions on state and local 
interests. The NCUA, a regulatory 
agency as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5), 
voluntarily complies with the executive 
order to adhere to fundamental 
federalism principles. This proposed 
rule would apply to all FICUs, including 
state-chartered credit unions. The 
NCUA expects that any effect on states 
or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government will be minor. The 
proposed changes would remove an 
existing requirement on state-chartered 
credit unions and would not affect the 
division of responsibilities between the 
NCUA and state regulatory authorities 
with oversight of federally insured, 
state-chartered credit unions. These 
changes relate to the NCUA’s insurance 
of member accounts, which is a distinct 
federal function. The proposed changes 
are deregulatory and would relieve 
burdens on state-chartered credit 
unions. The rulemaking would therefore 
not have a direct effect on the states, the 
relationship between the national 
government and the states, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
F. Assessment of Federal Regulations 
and Policies on Families 
The NCUA has determined that this 
proposed rule would not affect family 
well-being within the meaning of 
section 654 of the Treasury and General 
Government Appropriations Act, 
1999.
19
The proposed rule relates to 
FICUs’ advertisements, but the Board 
does not believe it will cause member 
confusion regarding share insurance 
coverage. Therefore, any effect on family 
well-being is expected to be indirect.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Introduction 
A. Background 
Part 748 requires a FICU to notify the 
appropriate NCUA Regional Director 
within five business days of any 
catastrophic act that occurs at its 
office(s). NCUA regulations define a 
catastrophic act as ‘‘any disaster, natural 
or otherwise, resulting in physical 
destruction or damage to the credit 
union or causing an interruption in vital 
member services, as defined in § 749.1 
of this chapter, projected to last more 
than two consecutive business days.’’

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS60592 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Proposed Rules NCUA has long required catastrophic act reporting. 
In 1970, Congress amended the Federal Credit 
Union Act (FCU Act) to require that the NCUA 
promulgate rules establishing minimum standards 
for the installation, maintenance, and operation of 
security devices and procedures to discourage 
robberies, burglaries, and larcenies. The 1970 
amendment to the FCU Act also required the agency 
to adopt time limits for compliance and mandated 
the submission of periodic reports. See 12 U.S.C. 1785(e) (Pub. L. 91–468) (84 Stat. 1002). Thus, since 
1971, the NCUA has promulgated regulations 
requiring the submission of reports within five 
working days of an occurrence, or attempted 
occurrence, of a crime or catastrophic act. See 36 FR 10940 (June 1, 1971). See also 47 FR 17981 (Apr. 
27, 1982); 50 FR 53295 (Dec. 31, 1985).

8
12 U.S.C. 1766(a). 
The agency adopted this requirement 
under 12 U.S.C. 1785(e), which requires 
the agency to promulgate rules 
establishing minimum safety standards 
relating to security. 
In 2007, NCUA amended the 
definition of catastrophic act ‘‘to 
address concerns that relatively minor 
events could be construed to trigger the 
need to file a report and, also, clarifying 
the causal link between a disaster and 
an interruption in vital member 
services.’’
2
The Board believed these 
changes to be ‘‘consistent with the usual 
and customary meaning of the word 
catastrophe.’’
3
The Board stated, 
‘‘[t]hese changes also reinforce the 
Board’s view that the reporting 
requirement applies only to a disaster as 
opposed to a circumstance where 
physical damage or a business closing 
occurs but is not disaster-related.’’
4
 
While natural disasters were the leading 
concern in the aftermath of hurricanes 
Katrina and Rita, the use of the phrasing 
‘‘any disaster, natural or otherwise’’ in 
the definition of catastrophic act was 
meant to illustrate other events, such as 
a power grid failure or physical attack, 
for example, could have a similar 
impact on access to member services 
and vital records. 
B. Legal Authority 
The Board is issuing this proposed 
rule pursuant to its authority under the 
Federal Credit Union Act (FCU Act).
5
 
Under the FCU Act, the NCUA is the 
chartering and supervisory authority for 
federal credit unions (FCUs) and the 
federal supervisory authority for 
federally insured credit unions (FICUs). 
The FCU Act grants the NCUA a broad 
mandate to issue regulations governing 
both FCUs and FICUs. Section 120 of 
the FCU Act is a general grant of 
regulatory authority and authorizes the 
Board to prescribe regulations for the 
administration of the FCU Act.
6
Section 
209 of the FCU Act is a plenary grant 
of regulatory authority to the NCUA to 
issue regulations necessary or 
appropriate to carry out its role as share 
insurer for all FICUs.
7
The FCU Act also 
includes an express grant of authority 
for the Board to subject federally 
chartered central, or corporate, credit 
unions to such rules, regulations, and 
orders as the Board deems appropriate.
8
 
II. Proposed Rule 
The Board is proposing to further ease 
the reporting burden with the following 
amendments. First, the proposal would 
amend the regulation to require that 
credit unions notify ‘‘NCUA’’ rather 
than the specific ‘‘regional director.’’ 
This change is intended to modernize 
the reporting process and provide 
greater operational flexibility for both 
FICUs and the agency. By designating 
‘‘NCUA’’ as the recipient, the agency 
can centralize and streamline the intake 
of these critical reports, ensuring they 
are routed efficiently to the appropriate 
personnel for response and monitoring. 
This change would remove the burden 
on a credit union, which may be 
operating under emergency conditions, 
to identify and direct its report to a 
specific regional office. 
Second, the proposal would extend 
the timeframe for submitting a 
catastrophic act report from ‘‘5 business 
days’’ to ‘‘15 calendar days.’’ The Board 
believes the current five-day deadline 
may be impractical for an institution 
recovering from a significant operational 
disruption. Extending the deadline to 15 
calendar days provides credit union 
management with a more reasonable 
amount of time to stabilize operations, 
assess the full scope of the damage, and 
provide a more accurate report to the 
agency. This change acknowledges the 
significant operational challenges that 
follow a catastrophic act and would 
allow a credit union to prioritize 
recovery efforts over immediate 
administrative reporting. 
Finally, the Board proposes to remove 
the prescriptive list of items that a credit 
union should include in its internal 
record of a catastrophic act and replace 
it with a requirement that a credit union 
record the basic facts of the event. The 
current rule suggests documenting 
details such as the location, timing, loss 
amount, and potential operational 
deficiencies. While maintaining a record 
containing the basic facts of an event is 
a prudent business practice, the Board 
believes that specifying the exact 
contents of this internal record to the 
degree currently required is an 
unnecessary and overly prescriptive 
regulatory burden. FICUs already 
maintain records of such events as part 
of their own business continuity and 
disaster recovery planning. Removing 
the list of items in this sentence would 
reduce administrative overhead and 
allow FICUs the flexibility to document 
these incidents in a manner that best 
suits their operational and 
recordkeeping policies, while still 
ensuring a record is created and 
maintained. This change would also 
make the regulation clearer by removing 
a provision that is phrased as a 
suggestion and not a requirement with 
the use of the word ‘‘should.’’ 
Commenters are invited to provide 
feedback on these proposed changes to 
the catastrophic act reporting 
requirements. Specifically, the Board 
seeks feedback on whether the proposed 
amendments appropriately balance the 
agency’s need for timely information 
with the operational burdens faced by 
FICUs during a crisis. The Board is also 
seeking comment on whether credit 
unions should be permitted to use 
existing notification tools, such as the 
form currently used to report 
cybersecurity incidents under section 
748.1(c), to report catastrophic acts. 
Commenters are also invited to address 
whether the proposed 15-calendar-day 
reporting timeframe is appropriate and 
whether the removal of the 
recordkeeping elements would provide 
meaningful burden reduction. 
III. Regulatory Procedures 
A. Providing Accountability Through 
Transparency Act of 2023 
The Providing Accountability 
Through Transparency Act of 2023 (5 
U.S.C. 553(b)(4)) (Act) requires that a 
notice of proposed rulemaking include 
the internet address of a summary of not 
more than 100 words in length of a 
proposed rule, in plain language, that 
shall be posted on the internet website 
under section 206(d) of the E- 
Government Act of 2002 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
note) (commonly known as 
regulations.gov). The Act, under its 
terms, applies to notices of proposed 
rulemaking and does not expressly 
include other types of documents that 
the Board publishes voluntarily for 
public comment, such as notices and 
interim-final rules that request comment 
despite invoking ‘‘good cause’’ to forgo 
such notice and public procedure. The 
Board, however, has elected to address 
the Act’s requirement in these types of 
documents in the interests of 
administrative consistency and 
transparency.

proposed rule to amend the

requirements for FICUs to report 
catastrophic acts to the agency. By 
providing more time for FICUs to notify 
the agency of the occurrence of a 
catastrophic act and by eliminating the 
specific list of items to be documented, 
the Board expects the proposed rule to 
reduce their compliance burden and 
allow FICUs to focus their resources on 
recovery and core functions without 
compromising safety and soundness. 
The proposal and the required 
summary can be found at https://
www.regulations.gov. 
B. Executive Orders 12866, 13563, and 
14192 
Pursuant to Executive Order 12866 
(‘‘Regulatory Planning and Review’’), as 
amended by Executive Order 14215, a 
determination must be made whether a 
regulatory action is significant and 
therefore subject to review by the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) in 
accordance with the requirements of the 
Executive Order.
9
Executive Order 
13563 (‘‘Improving Regulation and 
Regulatory Review’’) supplements and 
reaffirms the principles, structures, and 
definitions governing contemporary 
regulatory review established in 
Executive Order 12866.
10
This proposed 
rule was drafted and reviewed in 
accordance with Executive Order 12866 
and Executive Order 13563. OMB has 
determined that this proposed rule is 
not a ‘‘significant regulatory action’’ as 
defined in section 3(f)(1) of Executive 
Order 12866. Further, this proposed rule 
is consistent with Executive Order 
13563. The proposed rule will reduce 
the burden of catastrophic act reporting 
by increasing the time FICUs have to 
report to the agency and giving them the 
flexibility to determine what to 
incorporate into their record of an 
incident. 
Executive Order 14192 (‘‘Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation’’) 
requires that any new incremental costs 
associated with new regulations shall, to 
the extent permitted by law, be offset by 
the elimination of existing costs 
associated with at least 10 prior 
regulations.
11
This proposed rule is 
expected to be a deregulatory action for 
purposes of Executive Order 14192. 
C. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act
12
 
generally requires an agency to conduct 
a regulatory flexibility analysis of any 
rule subject to notice and comment 
rulemaking requirements, unless the 
agency certifies that the rule will not 
have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities. If 
the agency makes such a certification, it 
shall publish the certification at the 
time of publication of either the 
proposed rule or the final rule, along 
with a statement providing the factual 
basis for such certification.
13
For 
purposes of this analysis, the NCUA 
considers small credit unions to be 
those having under $100 million in 
assets.
14
The Board fully considered the 
potential economic impacts of the 
regulatory amendments on small credit 
unions. 
The proposed rule reduces and 
simplifies aspects of part 748 related to 
catastrophic act reporting. Even if the 
magnitude of the change is significant, 
the NCUA certifies that the proposed 
rule will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. 
Accordingly, the NCUA certifies the 
proposed rule would not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small credit 
unions. 
D. Paperwork Reduction Act 
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(PRA) generally provides that an agency 
may not conduct or sponsor, and not 
withstanding any other provision of 
law, a person is not required to respond 
to, a collection of information, unless it 
displays a currently valid Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) control 
number. The PRA applies to 
rulemakings in which an agency creates 
a new or amends existing information 
collection requirements. For purposes of 
the PRA, an information-collection 
requirement may take the form of a 
reporting, recordkeeping, or a third- 
party disclosure requirement. The 
NCUA has determined that the changes 
described in this notice do not create a 
new information collection or revise an 
existing information collection as 
defined by the PRA. 
E. Executive Order 13132 on Federalism 
Executive Order 13132 encourages 
certain agencies to consider the impact 
of their actions on state and local 
interests. The NCUA, an agency as 
defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5), complies 
with the executive order to adhere to 
fundamental federalism principles. This 
proposed rule is intended to reduce the 
burden on FICUs by simplifying 
catastrophic act reporting. The 
rulemaking would therefore not have 
direct effect on the states, the 
relationship between the national 
government and the states, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
F. Assessment of Federal Regulations 
and Policies on Families 
The NCUA has determined that this 
proposed rule would not affect family 
well-being within the meaning of 
section 654 of the Treasury and General 
Government Appropriations Act, 
1999.
15
The proposed rule relates to 
FICU operations in the aftermath of a 
catastrophic act, and any effect on 
family well-being is expected to be 
indirect.

Required Use by Foreign Applicants 
and Patent Owners of a Patent 
Practitioner 
AGENCY: United States Patent and Trademark Office, Commerce. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or Office) is 
proposing to amend the Rules of 
Practice in Patent Cases to require 
patent applicants and patent owners 
whose domicile is not located within 
the United States (U.S.) or its territories 
(hereinafter foreign applicants/inventors 
and patent owners) to be represented by 
a registered patent practitioner. A 
requirement that foreign applicants/ 
inventors and patent owners be 
represented by a registered patent 
practitioner would bring the United 
States in line with most other countries 
that require that such parties be 
represented by a licensed or registered 
person of that country. Additionally, 
this requirement would increase 
efficiency and enable the USPTO to 
more effectively use available 
mechanisms to enforce compliance by 
all foreign applicants/inventors and 
patent owners with U.S. statutory and 
regulatory requirements in patent 
matters, and enhance the USPTO’s 
ability to respond to false certifications, 
misrepresentations, and fraud. 
DATES: Comments must be received by January 28, 2026 to ensure 
consideration. 
ADDRESSES: For reasons of government efficiency, comments must be submitted 
through the Federal eRulemaking Portal 
at www.regulations.gov. To submit comments via the portal, one should 
enter docket number PTO–P–2025–0008 
on the homepage and select ‘‘Search.’’ 
The site will provide search results 
listing all documents associated with 
this docket. Commenters can find a 
reference to this proposed rule and 
select the ‘‘Comment’’ icon, complete 
the required fields, and enter or attach 
their comments. Attachments to 
electronic comments will be accepted in 
Adobe

portable document format 
(PDF) or Microsoft Word

format. 
Because comments will be made 
available for public inspection, 
information that the submitter does not 
desire to make public, such as an 
address or phone number, should not be 
included in the comments. 
Visit the Federal eRulemaking Portal 
for additional instructions on providing 
comments via the portal. If electronic 
submission of or access to comments is 
not feasible due to a lack of access to a 
computer and/or the internet, please 
contact the USPTO using the contact 
information below for special 
instructions.

uspto.gov. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
Pursuant to its authority under 35 
U.S.C. 2(b)(2), the USPTO is proposing 
to revise the rules in part 1 of title 37 
of the Code of Federal Regulations to 
require foreign applicants/inventors and 
patent owners to be represented by a 
registered patent practitioner, as defined 
in 37 CFR 1.32(a)(1) (i.e., a registered patent attorney or registered patent 
agent under 37 CFR 11.6 or an 
individual given limited recognition 
under § 11.9(a) or (b) or § 11.16) 
(hereinafter, registered patent 
practitioner). Requiring all foreign 
applicants/inventors and patent owners 
to be represented by a registered patent 
practitioner (1) treats foreign applicants/ 
inventors and patent owners similarly to 
how U.S. applicants/inventors and 
patent owners are treated in other 
countries and harmonizes U.S. practice 
with the rest of the world; (2) increases 
efficiency as the USPTO spends extra 
resources to handle pro se applicants 
(i.e., an applicant who is prosecuting the application without a registered patent 
practitioner); (3) enables the USPTO to 
more effectively use available 
mechanisms to enforce compliance with 
statutory and regulatory requirements in 
patent matters; and (4) enhances the 
USPTO’s ability to respond to false 
certifications, misrepresentations, and 
fraud. 
A. Harmonization of U.S. Practice With 
Other Intellectual Property (IP) Offices 
With Respect to Representation 
Almost all IP Offices require foreign 
applicants/inventors and patent owners 
to be represented by a person licensed 
or registered in that country. The 
USPTO is proposing to implement a 
similar requirement. Requiring foreign 
applicants/inventors and patent owners 
to be represented by a registered patent 
practitioner would help to harmonize 
patent filing practice across IP Offices. 
B. Increase Efficiency 
The USPTO utilizes extra resources to 
assist pro se inventors. Requiring foreign applicants/inventors and patent 
owners to use registered patent 
practitioners will increase efficiency, as 
the applications will be in better form 
for examination. Applications from pro 
se inventors generally require additional processing by the Office of Patent 
Application Processing because the 
application papers are often not in 
condition for publication, examination, 
or both. Additionally, pro se 
applications usually require patent 
examiners to spend examination time 
on procedural matters, thereby 
increasing overall patent application 
pendency. Implementing this proposed 
rule would help allocate USPTO 
resources to the merits of examination 
and, accordingly, decrease patent 
application processing times. 
C. Enforce Compliance With U.S. 
Statutory and Regulatory Requirements 
The requirement for representation by 
a registered patent practitioner is also 
necessary to enforce compliance by all 
foreign patent applicants/inventors and 
patent owners with U.S. statutory and 
regulatory requirements in patent 
matters. Registered patent practitioners 
are subject to the USPTO Rules of 
Professional Conduct and disciplinary 
sanctions for violations of those rules. 
See 37 CFR 11.15, 11.20, and 11.100– 11.901. Accordingly, registered patent 
practitioners have various obligations to 
the USPTO, including a duty to 
cooperate with inquiries and 
investigations. See, e.g., 37 CFR 11.303 and 11.801. 
The USPTO has noticed an increase 
in the number of false micro entity 
certifications to claim a reduction in 
fees and other false certification 
documents being filed. False 
certifications unjustly diminish the 
monetary resources of the USPTO, and 
false certifications on petitions or 
requests to expedite examination result 
in applications being unjustly advanced 
out of turn. Requiring submissions to be

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS60595 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Proposed Rules made by registered patent practitioners 
subject to the USPTO Rules of 
Professional Conduct and concomitant 
disciplinary sanctions imposed by the 
USPTO Director will make it less likely 
that the submissions will be signed by 
an unauthorized party or contain 
inaccurate or fraudulent statements, 
particularly with regard to any 
certification of micro entity status to 
claim a reduction in fees and any 
certification relevant to expediting the 
application. 
D. Fraud Mitigation and the Integrity of 
the U.S. Patent System 
Requiring foreign patent applicants/ 
inventors and patent owners to use 
registered patent practitioners will also 
facilitate fraud mitigation and protect 
the integrity of the U.S. patent system. 
As discussed, registered patent 
practitioners have a duty to cooperate 
with investigations and respond to 
lawful requests for information. See 37 CFR 11.801(b). Further, it is professional 
misconduct for a registered patent 
practitioner to engage in conduct 
involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or 
misrepresentation. See 37 CFR 11.804(c). It is also professional 
misconduct for a registered patent 
practitioner to engage in conduct that is 
prejudicial to the administration of 
justice. See 37 CFR 11.804(d). Because registered patent practitioners are 
subject to disciplinary sanctions 
pursuant to 37 CFR 11.15 and 11.20, 
they have an interest in responding to 
inquiries and investigations that extends 
beyond the outcome of a particular 
application. 
For example, the USPTO currently 
sends fee deficiency notices in 
applications which appear to have false 
micro entity certifications, and can also 
send requests for information or show 
cause orders in applications in which an 
apparent misrepresentation has been 
made. In patent applications with pro se 
inventor-applicants, abandonment of 
the application effectively terminates 
the USPTO’s ability to gather 
information. If a subsequent application 
is filed on the same subject matter, it 
may be difficult or impossible for the 
USPTO to establish that the applications 
are commonly owned or otherwise 
attributable to the same parties. 
However, when a registered patent 
practitioner is of record in the 
application or files papers in the 
application, the ability of the USPTO to 
gather information about the 
certifications or representations that 
were made extends beyond 
abandonment of the application. 
Therefore, requiring foreign patent 
applicants/inventors and patent owners 
to use registered patent practitioners 
would facilitate fraud mitigation and 
protect the integrity of the U.S. patent 
system. 
II. Enforcement 
Unsigned or improperly signed papers 
are not entered into the record of the 
application or patent. See, e.g., MPEP 
714.01. As such, when representation by 
a registered patent practitioner is 
required, papers such as amendments 
and other replies, application data 
sheets, information disclosure 
statements, or petitions, would not be 
entered unless they are signed by a 
registered patent practitioner. This 
would not apply to papers which are 
required to be signed by a specific party, 
such as the inventor’s oath or 
declaration under 37 CFR 1.63. 
The definition of the term ‘‘domicile’’ 
is provided in proposed 37 CFR 1.9(p). 
The domicile of an inventor-applicant 
will normally be determined by the 
residence information provided in the 
application data sheet (ADS) under 37 
CFR 1.76, or the inventor’s oath or 
declaration under 37 CFR 1.63 
(including a substitute statement under 
37 CFR 1.64). The domicile of an 
applicant who is not an inventor will 
normally be determined based on the 
mailing address provided in the 
Applicant Information section of the 
ADS. If an ADS is inconsistent with the 
information provided in another 
document that was submitted at the 
same time or prior to the ADS 
submission, the ADS will control. See 
37 CFR 1.76(d). This is because the ADS 
is intended to be the means by which an 
applicant provides complete 
bibliographic information. In some 
instances, the USPTO may refer to 
sources other than those listed above for 
purposes of assessing compliance with 
the domicile requirement. For example, 
in order to determine whether the 
domicile is accurate, the USPTO may 
refer to the notarized Patent Electronic 
System Verification form or other 
identity verification information. 
A paper filed on behalf of the patent 
owner may indicate the domicile of the 
patent owner if such information is not 
present in the application file. When it 
is necessary for the USPTO to act on a 
paper submitted in the file of an issued 
patent and the paper is not signed by a 
registered patent practitioner, the paper 
may not be treated on its merits. For 
example, if a petition to accept 
unintentionally delayed payment of a 
maintenance fee in an expired patent 
under 37 CFR 1.378(b) is filed that is not 
signed by a registered patent 
practitioner, the petition may be 
dismissed before consideration on the 
merits if it cannot be determined 
whether the paper complies with 37 
CFR 1.31 and 1.33(b). 
Regarding the assessment of 
compliance referred to above, 
applicants, patent owners, and 
practitioners are reminded that the 
presentation to the Office of any paper 
by a party, whether a practitioner or 
non-practitioner, constitutes a 
certification under 37 CFR 11.18(b). A 
misrepresentation of the domicile of an 
applicant or patent owner would not be 
‘‘to the best of the party’s knowledge, 
information and belief, formed after an 
inquiry reasonable under the 
circumstances’’ as required under 37 
CFR 11.18(b)(2). Violations of 37 CFR 
11.18(b)(2) by a party, whether a 
practitioner or non-practitioner, may 
result in the imposition of sanctions 
under 37 CFR 11.18(c), which may 
include termination of the proceedings. 
See 37 CFR 1.4(d)(5)(i). III. Discussion of Specific Rules 
The following is a discussion of 
proposed amendments to 37 CFR part 1: 
A. Section 1.9 
Section 1.9 is proposed to be 
amended to add new paragraph (p) 
defining domicile as the permanent 
legal place of residence of a natural 
person or the principal place of business 
of a juristic entity. The domicile of an 
inventor-applicant will normally be 
determined by the residence 
information provided in the ADS under 
37 CFR 1.76, or the inventor’s oath or 
declaration under 37 CFR 1.63 
(including a substitute statement under 
37 CFR 1.64). The domicile of an 
applicant who is not an inventor will 
normally be determined based on the 
mailing address provided in the 
Applicant Information section of the 
ADS. See section II. above for further discussion. 
B. Section 1.31 
Section 1.31 is proposed to be 
amended to add the title and rule to 
include ‘‘patent owner,’’ and 
reformatting the rule language into 
paragraphs (a) and (b). The section is 
further proposed to be amended to 
indicate that an applicant as defined in 
§ 1.42 or patent owner whose domicile 
is not located within the U.S. or its 
territories must be represented by a 
registered patent practitioner. The 
section is also proposed to be amended 
to require that a patent owner who is a 
juristic entity must be represented by a 
registered patent practitioner. The 
section previously required a juristic 
entity who was the applicant to be 
represented by a registered patent 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\29DEP1.SGM 29DEP1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS60596 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Proposed Rules practitioner, but has now been 
expanded to make a similar requirement 
for patent owners in post-grant 
proceedings. 
The phrase ‘‘an applicant as defined 
in § 1.42’’ in paragraph (a) encompasses 
any inventor, joint inventor, legal 
representative, person to whom the 
inventor has assigned, person to whom 
the inventor is under an obligation to 
assign, or person who otherwise shows 
sufficient proprietary interest in the 
matter who is named as an applicant. 
Thus, an applicant as defined in § 1.42 
must be represented by a registered 
patent practitioner if at least one of the 
parties identified as the applicant has a 
domicile that is not located within the 
U.S. or its territories. See § 1.31(a)(2). As a reminder, powers of attorney must be 
signed by all parties identified as the 
applicant in order to be effective. 
C. Section 1.32 
Section 1.32 is proposed to be 
amended to add the definition of patent 
practitioner to partially parallel 
§ 11.10(a). 
D. Section 1.33 
Section 1.33 is proposed to be 
amended to add paragraph (b)(3) to 
indicate that for amendments and other 
papers filed in an application or patent 
unless otherwise specified submitted on 
behalf of a juristic entity, an applicant 
as defined in § 1.42 whose domicile is 
not located within the United States or 
its territories, or a patent owner whose 
domicile is not located within the 
United States or its territories must be 
signed by a patent practitioner. These 
revisions to paragraph (b)(3) are 
consistent with the changes to § 1.31, 
discussed above. 
A foreign domiciled inventor who is 
the applicant may initially file a U.S. 
patent application with the USPTO and 
pay the filing fee at the time of filing. 
However, any application data sheet 
that accompanies the application papers 
or is submitted later, as well as all 
follow-on correspondence, must be 
signed by a patent practitioner. A patent 
practitioner must also sign any petition 
that is filed in such an application, 
including but not limited to a request 
for prioritized examination and a 
petition to make special. To pay the 
issue fee, PTOL–85 Part B would also 
have to be signed by a patent 
practitioner. 
IV. Rulemaking Considerations 
A. Administrative Procedure Act 
This rulemaking would revise the 
procedures governing the representation 
of patent applicants and patent owners 
at the USPTO. The proposed changes do 
not change the substantive criteria of 
patentability. Therefore, the changes in 
this rulemaking involve rules of agency 
practice and procedure and/or 
interpretive rules and do not require 
notice-and-comment rulemaking, 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A)). See 
Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 97, 101 (2015) (explaining that 
interpretive rules ‘‘advise the public of 
the agency’s construction of the statutes 
and rules which it administers’’ and do 
not require notice-and-comment when 
issued or amended); Cooper Techs. Co. 
v. Dudas, 536 F.3d 1330, 1336–37 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (5 U.S.C. 553, and thus 35 
U.S.C. 2(b)(2)(B), do not require notice- 
and-comment rulemaking for 
‘‘interpretative rules, general statements 
of policy, or rules of agency 
organization, procedure, or practice’’); 
In re Chestek PLLC, 92 F.4th 1105, 1110 
(Fed. Cir. 2024) (noting that rule 
changes that ‘‘do[ ] not alter the 
substantive standards by which the 
USPTO evaluates trademark 
applications’’ are procedural in nature 
and thus ‘‘exempted from notice-and- 
comment rulemaking.’’); and JEM 
Broadcasting Co. v. F.C.C., 22 F.3d 320, 328 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (‘‘[T]he ‘critical 
feature’ of the procedural exception [in 
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A)] ‘is that it covers 
agency actions that do not themselves 
alter the rights or interests of parties, 
although [they] may alter the manner in 
which the parties present themselves or 
their viewpoints to the agency.’ ’’ 
(quoting Batterton v. Marshall, 648 F.2d 694, 707 (D.C. Cir. 1980))). However, the 
USPTO has chosen to seek public 
comment before implementing the rule 
to benefit from the public’s input. 
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
As prior notice and an opportunity for 
public comment are not required 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other 
law, neither a Regulatory Flexibility Act 
analysis nor a certification under the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, 
et seq.) is required. See 5 U.S.C. 603. Nevertheless, the USPTO publishes this 
IRFA to examine the impact on small 
entities of the Office’s proposed 
requirement that patent applicants and 
patent owners whose domicile is not 
located within the United States (U.S.) 
or its territories (hereinafter ‘‘foreign 
applicants/inventors and patent 
owners’’) be represented by a registered 
patent practitioner, as defined in 37 CFR 
1.32(a)(1), and to seek the public’s 
views. The USPTO developed this IRFA 
to promote transparency and to inform 
the public of the impacts of this rule. 
The term domicile is defined as the 
permanent legal place of residence of a 
natural person or the principal place of 
business of a juristic entity, as provided 
in new paragraph (p) under 37 CFR 1.9 
of this proposed rule. Items 1–5 below 
discuss the five items specified in 5 
U.S.C. 603(b)(1)–(5) to be addressed in 
an IRFA. Item 6 below discusses any 
alternatives to this proposal that the 
Office considered under 5 U.S.C. 603(c). 
1. Description of the Reasons That 
Action by the USPTO Is Being 
Considered 
The USPTO proposes to require that 
foreign applicants/inventors and patent 
owners be represented by a registered 
patent practitioner, as defined in 
proposed 37 CFR 1.32(a)(1). An 
‘‘applicant’’ is the person applying for a 
patent, and can be any inventor, joint 
inventor, legal representative, person to 
whom the inventor has assigned, person 
to whom the inventor is under an 
obligation to assign, or person who 
otherwise shows sufficient proprietary 
interest in the matter who is named as 
an applicant. Under this proposed rule, 
foreign applicants/inventors and patent 
owners must be represented by a 
registered patent practitioner if at least 
one of the parties identified as an 
applicant or a patent owner has a 
domicile that is not located within the 
U.S. or its territories. A patent 
practitioner as defined in proposed 37 
CFR 1.32(a)(1) means a registered patent 
attorney or registered patent agent under 
37 CFR 11.6 or an individual given 
limited recognition under § 11.9(a) or (b) 
or § 11.16. When representation by a 
registered patent practitioner is 
required, papers such as amendments 
and other replies, application data 
sheets, information disclosure 
statements, or petitions, will not be 
entered unless they are signed by a 
registered patent practitioner; papers 
which are required to be signed by a 
specific party, such as the inventor’s 
oath or declaration under 37 CFR 1.63, 
are excluded. The requirement for a 
registered patent practitioner is 
applicable to all applications types (i.e., 
utility, plant, design, etc.). This 
proposed rule would bring the United 
States in line with most other countries 
that require that such parties be 
represented by a licensed or registered 
person of that country. Additionally, 
this proposed rule would increase 
efficiency and enable the USPTO to 
more effectively use available 
mechanisms to enforce compliance by 
all foreign applicants/inventors and 
patent owners with U.S. statutory and 
regulatory requirements in patent 
matters, and enhance the USPTO’s 
ability to respond to false certifications, 
misrepresentations, and fraud. The rule

Fiscal year (FY) 2022 data is being used for this 
analysis to correspond with the most current 
available estimates of legal costs as published by 
American Intellectual Property Law Association in 
its 2023 Report on the Economic Survey. Patent 
application data show that filing trends in FY 2023 
and FY 2024 have been consistent with FY 2022, 
with filings in FY 2023 totaling 516,915 and filings 
in FY 2024 totaling 527,538.

An application is determined to be pro se if 
there are no current attorney(s) associated with the 
application or if no attorney(s) has been directly 
associated with the application over the 
application’s prosecution history. 
is also amended to require that a patent 
owner who is a juristic entity must be 
represented by a registered patent 
practitioner. The rule previously 
required a juristic entity who was the 
applicant to be represented by a 
registered patent practitioner, and has 
now been expanded to make explicit a 
similar requirement for patent owners in 
post-grant proceedings. 
2. Succinct Statement of the Objectives 
of, and Legal Basis for, the Proposed 
Rule 
The USPTO undertakes this proposed 
rule pursuant to its authority under 35 
U.S.C. 2(b)(2), which authorizes the 
USPTO Director to establish regulations, 
not inconsistent with law, governing the 
conduct of proceedings in the Office. 
The policy objectives of the proposed 
rule are to: (1) treat foreign applicants/ 
inventors and patent owners similarly to 
how U.S. applicants/inventors and 
patent owners are treated in other 
countries and harmonize U.S. practice 
with the rest of the world; (2) increase 
efficiency by reducing the extra 
resources the USPTO spends to handle 
pro se applicants (i.e., an applicant who is prosecuting the application without a 
registered patent practitioner); (3) 
enable the USPTO to more effectively 
use available mechanisms to enforce 
compliance with statutory and 
regulatory requirements in patent 
matters; and (4) enhance the USPTO’s 
ability to respond to false certifications, 
misrepresentations, and fraud. 
3. Description of and, Where Feasible, 
an Estimate of the Number of Small 
Entities to Which the Proposed Rule 
Will Apply 
The Small Business Administration 
(SBA) small business size standards that 
are applicable to most analyses 
conducted to comply with the RFA are 
set forth in 13 CFR 121.201. These 
regulations generally define small 
businesses as those with fewer than a 
specified maximum number of 
employees or less than a specified level 
of annual receipts for the entity’s 
industrial sector or North American 
Industry Classification System (NAICS) 
code. As provided by the RFA, and after 
consulting with the SBA, the USPTO 
formally adopted an alternate size 
standard for the purpose of conducting 
an analysis or making a certification 
under the RFA for patent-related 
regulations. See Business Size Standard for Purposes of United States Patent and 
Trademark Office Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis for Patent-Related Regulations, 
71 FR 67109 (Nov. 20, 2006), 1313 Off. 
Gaz. Pat. Office 60 (Dec. 12, 2006). The 
USPTO’s alternate small business size 
standard is SBA’s previously 
established size standard that identifies 
the criteria entities must meet to be 
entitled to pay reduced patent fees. See 
13 CFR 121.802. 
If patent applicants assert or certify 
entitlement for reduced patent fees, the 
USPTO captures this data in its patent 
application data repository (formerly the 
Patent Application Locating and 
Monitoring (PALM) system and now 
called the One Patent Service Gateway 
(OPSG) system), which tracks 
information on each patent application 
submitted to the Office. 
Unlike the SBA small business size 
standards set forth in 13 CFR 121.201, 
the size standard for the USPTO is not 
industry specific. The Office’s definition 
of a small business concern for RFA 
purposes is a business or other concern 
that: (1) meets the SBA’s definition of a 
‘‘business concern or concern’’ set forth 
in 13 CFR 121.105; and (2) meets the 
size standards set forth in 13 CFR 
121.802 for the purpose of paying 
reduced patent fees, namely, an entity: 
(a) whose number of employees, 
including affiliates, does not exceed 500 
persons; and (b) which has not assigned, 
granted, conveyed, or licensed (and is 
under no obligation to do so) any rights 
in the invention to any person who 
made it and could not be classified as 
an independent inventor, or to any 
concern that would not qualify as a 
nonprofit organization or a small 
business concern under this definition. 
See Business Size Standard for Purposes of United States Patent and Trademark 
Office Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
for Patent-Related Regulations, 71 FR at 
67112 (Nov. 20, 2006), 1313 Off. Gaz. 
Pat. Office at 63 (Dec. 12, 2006). Thus, 
for the purpose of this analysis, the 
USPTO defines small entities to include 
applicants/inventors and patent owners 
who pay ‘‘small’’ or ‘‘micro’’ entity fees 
at the USPTO. 
In fiscal year (FY) 2022, the USPTO 
received 512,038 patent applications.
1
 
As discussed above, this proposed rule 
would impact those applications from 
foreign applicants/inventors or patent 
owners who are not represented by 
counsel. An applicant is considered to 
be a foreign applicant/inventor or patent 
owner if at least one party who was 
identified as an applicant or a patent 
owner had a domicile that was not 
located within the U.S. or its territories. 
As seen in Table 1 below, of the total 
512,038 patent applications filed in FY 
2022, 215,459 (42.1%) were filed by 
U.S. applicants/inventors and patent 
owners, and 296,579 (57.9%) were filed 
by foreign applicants/inventors and 
patent owners.

Table 2 below shows the number of 
applications that were filed without a 
registered patent practitioner (i.e., pro 
se) and those that were filed with a 
registered patent practitioner, in 
addition to the entity status of the 
applicant(s). Of the total 296,579 filings 
made by a foreign applicant/inventor or 
patent owner, 295,362 were represented 
by a registered patent practitioner 
(foreign represented) and 1,217 were not 
represented by a registered patent 
practitioner (foreign pro se).
2
The 1,217 
foreign pro se applications would be impacted by the requirement to retain 
representation by a registered patent 
practitioner under this proposed rule. 
The USPTO anticipates that this 
proposed rule would not have a 
substantial impact on foreign small 
entities. Of the total 295,362 foreign 
represented applications, 75,111 are 
considered to be small entities for the 
purposes of this analysis because they 
paid the ‘‘small’’ or ‘‘micro’’ entity fee 
(foreign represented small entities), and 
of the 1,217 foreign pro se applications, 
1,102 are considered to be small entities 
because they paid the ‘‘small’’ or 
‘‘micro’’ entity fee (foreign pro se small 
entities). The USPTO acknowledges that 
representation status in an application 
is dynamic, and some number of 
applicants change their status of 
representation after filing by either 
retaining a registered patent practitioner 
or separating from a registered patent 
practitioner and proceeding pro se. For 
the purposes of this analysis, the 
USPTO will assume that the 1,102 
applications filed by foreign pro se 
small entities did not change their

practitioner. Only 1,102 foreign pro se

requirements of the proposed rule, 
including an estimate of the classes of 
small entities which will be subject to 
the requirement and the type of 
professional skills necessary for 
preparation of the report or record: 
The proposed rule imposes no new 
reporting or recordkeeping 
requirements. Compliance with the rule 
will be enforced by requiring an 
appropriate signature on papers 
submitted in patent matters. Any 
registered patent practitioner retained 
by the foreign applicants/inventors and 
patent owners as a result of this 
proposed rule would be required to be 
a registered patent attorney or registered 
patent agent under 37 CFR 11.6 or an 
individual given limited recognition 
under § 11.9(a) or (b) or § 11.16. 
5. Identification, to the extent 
practicable, of all relevant Federal rules 
which may duplicate, overlap or 
conflict with the proposed rule: 
This proposed rule does not 
duplicate, overlap, or conflict with other 
Federal rules. 
6. Description of any significant 
alternatives to the proposed rule which 
accomplish the stated objectives of 
applicable statutes and which minimize 
any significant economic impact of the 
rule on small entities: 
The USPTO considered one 
alternative before proposing the 
requirement that foreign applicants/ 
inventors and patent owners be 
represented by a registered patent 
practitioner, as defined in proposed 37 
CFR 1.32(a)(1). A description of the 
proposed rule and the one alternative 
follows. 
Proposed Rule: Under the proposed 
rule, the USPTO proposes to require 
that foreign applicants/inventors and 
patent owners be represented by a 
registered patent practitioner, as defined 
in proposed 37 CFR 1.32(a)(1). An 
applicant must be represented by a 
registered patent practitioner if at least 
one of the parties identified as the 
applicant or patent owner has a 
domicile that is not located within the 
U.S. or its territories. When 
representation by a registered patent 
practitioner is required, papers such as 
amendments and other replies, 
application data sheets, information 
disclosure statements, or petitions, will 
not be entered unless they are signed by 
a registered patent practitioner; papers 
which are required to be signed by a 
specific party, such as the inventor’s 
oath or declaration under 37 CFR 1.63, 
are excluded. The requirement for a 
registered patent practitioner is 
applicable to all applications types (i.e., 
utility, plant, design, etc.). 
Due to the difficulty in quantifying 
the intangible benefits associated with 
the proposed rule, the Office provides a 
discussion of the qualitative benefits to 
patent applicants/inventors and patent 
owners. The primary benefits of the 
proposed rule are ensuring compliance 
by all foreign patent applicants/ 
inventors and patent owners with U.S. 
statutory and regulatory requirements in 
patent matters, and facilitating fraud 
mitigation and protecting the integrity 
of the U.S. patent system. The USPTO 
has noticed an increase in the number 
of false micro entity certifications to 
claim a reduction in fees and other false 
certification documents being filed. 
False certifications unjustly diminish 
the monetary resources of the USPTO, 
and false certifications on petitions or 
requests to expedite examination result 
in applications being unjustly advanced 
out of turn. Requiring submissions to be 
made by registered patent practitioners 
subject to the USPTO Rules of 
Professional Conduct and concomitant 
disciplinary sanctions imposed by the 
USPTO Director will make it less likely 
that the submissions will be signed by 
an unauthorized party or contain 
inaccurate or fraudulent statements, 
particularly with regard to any 
certification of micro entity status to 
claim a reduction in fees and any 
certification relevant to expediting the 
application. 
The proposed rule also addresses the 
increasing problem of patent application 
pendency. Pro se applications generally require additional processing by the 
Office of Patent Application Processing 
because the application papers are often 
not in condition for publication, 
examination, or both. Additionally, pro 
se applications usually require patent examiners to spend examination time 
on procedural matters, thereby 
increasing overall patent application 
pendency. This proposed rule would 
help allocate USPTO resources to the 
merits of examination and, accordingly, 
decrease patent application processing 
times. Requiring foreign applicants/ 
inventors and patent owners to use 
registered patent practitioners will 
increase efficiency, as the applications 
will be in better form for examination. 
Thus, the proposed rule would provide 
qualitative value to all applicants/ 
inventors and patent owners because 
this rule would help allocate USPTO 
resources to the merits of examination 
and, accordingly, generally decrease 
processing times for all patent 
applications. 
The RFA requires agencies to consider 
the economic impact of their regulatory 
proposals on small entities, specifically

The Report on the Economic Survey provides 
professional rates for legal services rendered only 
in utility applications. Because the professional 
rates in utility applications typically represent the 
upper range of legal costs, these rates will be used 
as a proxy to calculate the costs for legal services 
rendered for all applications, including plant and 
design applications. 
U.S. small businesses, small 
governmental jurisdictions and small 
organizations. This proposed rule would 
require all applicants/inventors and 
patent owners, in which at least one 
party identified as the applicant or 
patent owner has a foreign domicile, to 
be represented by a registered patent 
practitioner. Although there will be 
some number of U.S.-domiciled 
applicants/inventors and patent owners 
that will be affected because at least one 
party identified as the applicant or 
patent owner has a foreign domicile, the 
USPTO estimates that the number of 
foreign pro se small entities impacted by this rule (1,102) is small when 
compared to the 76,213 total foreign 
small entities that file patent 
applications. The costs incurred by the 
1,102 foreign pro se small entities 
would vary depending on the nature of 
legal services provided and complexity 
of the application. 
Tables 3, 4, and 5 below provide the 
estimated costs for a U.S. patent 
practitioner to prosecute an application 
based on professional rates as reported 
by the American Intellectual Property 
Law Association in the 2023 Report on 
the Economic Survey.

The professional 
rates
4
shown below are the median 
charges in FY 2022 for legal services 
rendered for a utility application.
5
The 
tables do not include services for which 
legal counsel is not required (e.g., 
payment of maintenance fees) or 
services that are not part of prosecution 
(such as ex parte reexamination, novelty 
search, validity and infringement 
opinions, and reference management). 
The figures in Tables 3 and 4 show the 
estimated legal cost for prosecuting 
applications that are of minimal 
complexity as well as applications that 
are relatively complex. 
Table 3 below provides the estimated 
cost to impacted entities if a U.S. patent 
practitioner is retained prior to filing of 
a non-provisional application. These 
cases include applications of foreign 
origin where no substantive direction is 
provided by the foreign attorney, and 
thus the patent practitioner would be 
required to provide substantive legal 
advice to prosecute the application, 
including legal services connected with 
preparing, filing, and prosecuting an 
application. Based on the total 
estimated number of applications filed 
by foreign applicants/inventors and 
patent owners that are also considered 
to be small entities, the total legal cost 
for non-provisional applications to 
comply with this proposed rule would 
range from $13,124,820 to $13,334,200 
for minimal complexity applications, to 
$16,430,820 to $19,395,200 for 
relatively complex applications.

practitioner is retained to file a non-

which the foreign attorney provides

U.S. patent practitioner would provide 
only minimal legal services connected 
with the initial filing an application and 
the subsequent filing of other 
documents. Based on the total estimated 
number of applications filed by foreign 
applicants/inventors and patent owners 
that are also considered to be small 
entities, the total legal cost for a non- 
provisional application to comply with 
this proposed rule would range from 
$4,336,370 to $4,545,750 for minimal

Table 5 below provides a list of 
services that may be provided to 
impacted entities before or during 
prosecution, but are dependent on the 
nature of the application. The 
prosecution of a patent application is 
highly variable and a particular 
application may or may not require any 
of these services. If these services are 
provided, then the costs below would be 
added to the total legal costs in Tables 
3 or 4, as applicable. The table below 
provides the percentage of all 
applications that have utilized these 
services.

that only 1,102 (or 1.4%) foreign pro se 
small entities would be impacted by this 
proposed rule. This is a very small 
number when compared to the 76,213 
total foreign small entities that file 
patent applications. Although the 
number of impacted small entities is not 
expected to be substantial, the economic 
impact varies depending on the nature 
of legal services provided and 
complexity of the application. Because 
prosecution of patent applications is 
highly variable, the legal costs incurred 
by the 1,102 foreign pro se small entities 
would depend on whether the 
application is of U.S. origin or foreign 
origin, with applications of U.S. origin 
incurring more cost than those of 
foreign origin, and the level of 
complexity of the application, with 
relatively complex applications 
incurring more cost than minimally 
complex applications. Legal costs would 
increase if any of the additional 
available services are utilized before or 
during prosecution. 
Alternative 1: The USPTO also 
considered the alternative to take no 
action and maintain the status quo 
(‘‘Alternative 1’’). Alternative 1 was 
rejected because the USPTO has 
determined that the requirement that 
foreign applicant/inventors and patent 
owners to be represented by a registered 
patent practitioner is needed to 
accomplish the stated objectives to 
increase efficiency and enable the 
USPTO to more effectively use available 
mechanisms to enforce compliance with 
U.S. statutory and regulatory 
requirements in patent matters, and to 
enhance the USPTO’s ability to respond 
to false certifications, 
misrepresentations, and fraud. 
C. Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory 
Planning and Review) 
This rulemaking has been determined 
to be not significant for purposes of 
Executive Order 12866 (September 30, 
1993). 
D. Executive Order 13563 (Improving 
Regulation and Regulatory Review) 
The USPTO has complied with 
Executive Order 13563 (January 18, 
2011). Specifically, and as discussed 
above, the USPTO has, to the extent 
feasible and applicable: (1) reasonably 
determined that the benefits of the rule 
justify its costs; (2) tailored the rule to 
impose the least burden on society 
consistent with obtaining the agency’s 
regulatory objectives; (3) selected a 
regulatory approach that maximizes net 
benefits; (4) specified performance 
objectives; (5) identified and assessed 
available alternatives; (6) involved the 
public in an open exchange of 
information and perspectives among 
experts in relevant disciplines, affected 
stakeholders in the private sector, and 
the public as a whole, and provided 
online access to the rulemaking docket; 
(7) attempted to promote coordination, 
simplification, and harmonization 
across government agencies and 
identified goals designed to promote 
innovation; (8) considered approaches

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS60601 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Proposed Rules that reduce burdens while maintaining 
flexibility and freedom of choice for the 
public; and (9) ensured the objectivity of 
scientific and technological information 
and processes. 
E. Executive Order 14192 (Deregulation) 
This regulation is not an Executive 
Order 14192 regulatory action because it 
is not significant under Executive Order 
12866. 
F. Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) 
This rulemaking pertains strictly to 
federal agency procedures and does not 
contain policies with federalism 
implications sufficient to warrant 
preparation of a Federalism Assessment 
under Executive Order 13132 (August 4, 
1999). 
G. Executive Order 13175 (Tribal 
Consultation) 
This rulemaking will not: (1) have 
substantial direct effects on one or more 
Indian tribes; (2) impose substantial 
direct compliance costs on Indian tribal 
governments; or (3) preempt tribal law. 
Therefore, a tribal summary impact 
statement is not required under 
Executive Order 13175 (November 6, 
2000). 
H. Executive Order 13211 (Energy 
Effects) 
This rulemaking is not a significant 
energy action under Executive Order 
13211 because this rulemaking is not 
likely to have a significant adverse effect 
on the supply, distribution, or use of 
energy. Therefore, a Statement of Energy 
Effects is not required under Executive 
Order 13211 (May 18, 2001). 
I. Executive Order 12988 (Civil Justice 
Reform) 
This rulemaking meets applicable 
standards to minimize litigation, 
eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden 
as set forth in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) 
of Executive Order 12988 (February 5, 
1996). 
J. Executive Order 13045 (Protection of 
Children) 
This rulemaking does not concern an 
environmental risk to health or safety 
that may disproportionately affect 
children under Executive Order 13045 
(April 21, 1997). 
K. Executive Order 12630 (Taking of 
Private Property) 
This rulemaking will not effect a 
taking of private property or otherwise 
have taking implications under 
Executive Order 12630 (March 15, 
1988). 
L. Congressional Review Act 
Under the Congressional Review Act 
provisions of the Small Business 
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 
1996 (5 U.S.C. 801, et seq.), the USPTO 
will submit a report containing the final 
rule and other required information to 
the United States Senate, the United 
States House of Representatives, and the 
Comptroller General of the Government 
Accountability Office. The changes in 
this rulemaking are not expected to 
result in an annual effect on the 
economy of $100 million or more, a 
major increase in costs or prices, or 
significant adverse effects on 
competition, employment, investment, 
productivity, innovation, or the ability 
of United States-based enterprises to 
compete with foreign-based enterprises 
in domestic and export markets. 
Therefore, this rulemaking is not 
expected to result in a ‘‘major rule’’ as 
defined in 5 U.S.C. 804(2). 
M. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 
1995 
The changes set forth in this 
rulemaking do not involve a Federal 
intergovernmental mandate that will 
result in the expenditure by State, local, 
and tribal governments, in the aggregate, 
of $100 million (as adjusted) or more in 
any one year, or a Federal private sector 
mandate that will result in the 
expenditure by the private sector of 
$100 million (as adjusted) or more in 
any one year, and will not significantly 
or uniquely affect small governments. 
Therefore, no actions are necessary 
under the provisions of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995. See 2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq. 
N. National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969 
This rulemaking will not have any 
effect on the quality of the environment 
and is thus categorically excluded from 
review under the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969. See 
42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. 
O. National Technology Transfer and 
Advancement Act of 1995 
The requirements of section 12(d) of 
the National Technology Transfer and 
Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 
272 note) are not applicable because this 
rulemaking does not contain provisions 
that involve the use of technical 
standards. 
P. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.) requires that the 
USPTO consider the impact of 
paperwork and other information 
collection burdens imposed on the 
public. The collection of information 
involved in this proposed rule has been 
reviewed and previously approved by 
OMB under control number 0651–0035. 
The USPTO will submit an update to 
the 0651–0035 information collection in 
the form of a nonsubstantive change 
request. 
Notwithstanding any other provision 
of law, no person is required to respond 
to, nor shall any person be subject to a 
penalty for failure to comply with, a 
collection of information subject to the 
requirements of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act unless that collection of 
information displays a currently valid 
OMB control number. 
Q. E-Government Act Compliance 
The USPTO is committed to 
compliance with the E-Government Act 
to promote the use of the internet and 
other information technologies, to 
provide increased opportunities for 
citizen access to Government 
information and services, and for other 
purposes.

(collectively, ASTP/ONC), Department 
of Health and Human Services (HHS). 
ACTION: Proposed rule; withdrawal of non-finalized provisions. 
SUMMARY: ASTP/ONC published in the Federal Register on August 5, 2024, a 
proposed rule, titled ‘‘Health Data, 
Technology, and Interoperability: 
Patient Engagement, Information 
Sharing, and Public Health 
Interoperability’’ (HTI–2), in which it 
proposed updating and adding 
regulations regarding health information 
technology, information blocking, and 
the Trusted Exchange Framework and 
the Common Agreement. The comment 
period closed on October 4, 2024. 
ASTP/ONC is withdrawing the 
remaining proposals that have not been 
finalized from the HTI–2 Proposed Rule. 
DATES: The non-finalized provisions of the proposed rule published at 89 FR 
63498 on August 5, 2024, are withdrawn 
effective December 29, 2025. 
ADDRESSES: Comments on the proposed rule published at 89 FR 63498 on

Michael Lipinski, Office of Policy, 
Assistant Secretary for Technology 
Policy/Office of the National 
Coordinator for Health Information 
Technology, 202–690–7151. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 5, 2024, ASTP/ONC issued the HTI–2 
Proposed Rule proposing to update 45 
CFR parts 170 and 171 and add part 
172. The comment period closed on 
October 4, 2024. 
ASTP/ONC finalized certain 
proposals from the HTI–2 Proposed 
Rule in December 2024 through the 
Health Data, Technology, and 
Interoperability: Trusted Exchange 
Framework and Common Agreement 
(TEFCA) (HTI–2) Final Rule (89 FR 
101772) and the Health Data, 
Technology, and Interoperability: 
Protecting Care Access (HTI–3) Final 
Rule (89 FR 102512). 
On January 31, 2025, President 
Donald J. Trump signed Executive Order 
(E.O.) 14192, ‘‘Unleashing Prosperity 
Through Deregulation.’’
1
Section 1 of 
E.O. 14192 states that it is the policy of 
the Administration to significantly 
reduce the private expenditures 
required to comply with Federal 
regulations to secure America’s 
economic prosperity and national 
security and the highest possible quality 
of life for each citizen. Consistent with 
E.O. 14192 and our planned 
deregulatory proposed rule (Health 
Data, Technology, and Interoperability: 
ASTP/ONC Deregulatory Actions to 
Unleash Prosperity (HTI–5) Proposed 
Rule),
2
ASTP/ONC reexamined the 
HTI–2 Proposed Rule. ASTP/ONC 
reviewed comments received in 
response to the HTI–2 Proposed Rule 
and reevaluated proposals not yet 
finalized. We determined that certain 
proposals should be finalized, while 
other proposals should not be finalized 
or needed further consideration, 
revision, or both. Recently, the Office of 
Management and Budget, the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services, and Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services (CMS), in 
collaboration with ASTP/ONC, issued 
separate requests for information (RFIs) 
related to deregulation. We reviewed 
comments received on these RFIs 
related to ASTP/ONC activities. In 
response to the Request for Information; 
Health Technology Ecosystem (90 FR 
21034) (CMS–ASTP/ONC RFI), 
commenters expressed a strong desire to 
modernize the ONC Health IT 
Certification Program (Certification 
Program) by making it more modular, 
application programming interface 
(API)-focused, and less centered on 
specific electronic health record (EHR) 
functionalities. After reviewing these 
additional comments and the comments 
submitted in response to the HTI–2 
Proposed Rule, we are withdrawing the 
remaining non-finalized proposals from 
the HTI–2 Proposed Rule. 
We determined that certain proposals 
would improve interoperability and 
reduce costs and burden within the U.S. 
health care system. Therefore, we 
finalized proposals for six new and one 
revised certification criteria in the 
Health Data, Technology, and 
Interoperability: Electronic Prescribing, 
Real-Time Prescription Benefit and

Prior Authorization (HTI–4) Final Rule 
(90 FR 37130). This final rule was 
published as a part of the Medicare 
Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective 
Payment Systems for Acute Care 
Hospitals (IPPS) and the Long-Term 
Care Hospital Prospective Payment 
System and Policy Changes and Fiscal 
Year (FY) 2026 Rates; Changes to the FY

Electronic Prescribing, Real-Time 
Prescription Benefit and Electronic Prior 
Authorization Final Rule, which 
appeared in the Federal Register on 
August 4, 2025 (90 FR 36536). 
ASTP/ONC is, however, withdrawing 
the remaining non-finalized proposals 
from the HTI–2 Proposed Rule for the 
following reasons: comments received 
on the HTI–2 Proposed Rule and the 
above-referenced RFIs; a focus on 
deregulation; and changes in applicable 
technologies, such as newer standards, 
updated application programming 
interfaces, and emerging artificial 
intelligence technologies. As to 
comments received on the HTI–2 
Proposed Rule, a number of commenters 
expressed concerns regarding the non- 
finalized proposals, such as a lack of 
clarity in some proposals, the 
availability of newer and/or more 
appropriate standards for certain 
proposed certification criteria, and 
excessive costs and burden for meeting 
certain proposals, if finalized. ASTP/ 
ONC will consider these and other 
stakeholder comments in conjunction 
with Administration and ASTP/ONC 
policies and priorities when crafting any 
future regulatory proposals related to 
the non-finalized provisions of the HTI– 
2 Proposed Rule. For now, we have 
concluded finalization of proposals 
from the HTI–2 Proposed Rule. We 
withdraw the remaining proposals of 
the HTI–2 Proposed Rule, generally 
identified as proposals to: 
€USCDI. Adopt the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) 
standard v4 (45 CFR 170.213(c)); 
establish an expiration date for USCDI 
v3; and update certification criteria that 
cross-reference USCDI: 
Æ‘‘Care coordination—Transitions of care—Create’’ (§ 170.315(b)(1)(iii)(A)(1) 
and (2)); 
Æ‘‘Care coordination—Clinical information reconciliation and 
incorporation—Reconciliation’’ 
(§ 170.315(b)(2)(iii)(D)(1) through (3)); 
Æ‘‘Decision support interventions— Decision support configuration’’ 
(§ 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(A) and (B), and 
‘‘Source attributes’’ 
(§ 170.315(b)(11)(iv)(A)(5) through (13)); 
Æ‘‘Patient engagement—View, download, and transmit to 3rd party— 
View’’ (§ 170.315(e)(1)(i)(A)(1) and (2)), 
and ‘‘Multi-factor authentication 
(§ 170.315(e)(1)(iii)); 
Æ‘‘Transmission to public health agencies—electronic case reporting’’ 
(§ 170.315(f)(5)(i)(C)(2)(i)); 
Æ‘‘Design and performance— Consolidated CDA creation 
performance’’ (§ 170.315(g)(6)(i)(A) and 
(B)); 
Æ‘‘Design and performance— Application access—all data request— 
Functional requirements’’ 
(§ 170.315(g)(9)(i)(A)(1) and (2)); and 
Æ‘‘Design and performance— Standardized API for patient and 
population services—Data response’’ 
(§ 170.315(g)(10)(i)(A) and (B)). 
€Imaging. Revise the certification criteria adopted in § 170.315(b)(1), 
(e)(1), and (g)(9) and (10) to include new 
certification requirements to support the 
access, exchange, and use of diagnostic 
images via imaging links. 
€Clinical Information Reconciliation and Incorporation. Require Health IT 
Modules to be capable of reconciling 
and incorporating all USCDI v4 data 
classes. As an alternative proposal, 
require reconciliation and incorporation 
of a smaller subset of data. 
€Standards for Encryption and Decryption of Electronic Health 
Information. Adopt the updated version of Annex A of the Federal Information 
Processing Standards (FIPS) 140–2 
(Draft, October 12, 2021) in 
§ 170.210(a)(3) and incorporate it by 
reference in § 170.299; add an 
expiration date of January 1, 2026, to the 
FIPS 140–2 (October 8, 2014) version of 
the standard adopted in § 170.210(a)(2); 
remove the standard found in 
§ 170.210(f); and revise impacted 
certification criteria: 
Æ§ 170.315(d)(7) ‘‘health IT encryption;’’ 
Æ§ 170.315 (d)(9) ‘‘trusted connection;’’ and 
Æ§ 170.315 (d)(12) ‘‘protect stored authentication credentials.’’ 
€Minimum Standards Code Sets. Adopt newer versions of the following 
minimum standards code sets: 
Æ§ 170.207(a)—Problems; Æ§ 170.207(c)—Laboratory tests; Æ§ 170.207(e)—Immunizations; Æ§ 170.207(f)—Race and Ethnicity; Æ§ 170.207(n)—Sex; Æ§ 170.207(o)—Sexual orientation and gender information; and 
Æ§ 170.207(p)—Social, 
psychological, and behavioral data. 
€Computerized Provider Order Entry—Laboratory Criterion. Update the 
‘‘computerized provider order entry— 
laboratory’’ certification criterion 
(§ 170.315(a)(2)) to require a Health IT 
Module to enable a user to create and 
transmit laboratory orders electronically 
according to the standard proposed in 
§ 170.205(g)(2) (HL7

Laboratory Order 
Interface (LOI) Implementation Guide 
(IG)); and require technology to receive 
and validate laboratory results 
according to the standard proposed in 
§ 170.205(g)(3) (HL7

Laboratory 
Results Interface (LRI) IG). 
€Encrypt Authentication Credentials. Revise § 170.315(d)(12) by replacing the 
‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ attestation requirement 
with a new requirement that Health IT 
Modules be able to demonstrate that 
they are able to store authentication 
credentials and protect the 
confidentiality and integrity of stored 
authentication credentials according to 
the Federal Information Processing 
Standards (FIPS) 140–2
3
(October 12, 
2021) standard; and by changing the 
name of the certification criterion to 
‘‘protect stored authentication 
credentials’’. 
€Public Health Data Exchange. Revise the certification criteria related 
to public health in § 170.315(f) by: 
adding several new functional 
requirements and adopting newer 
versions of standards within the current 
(f) certification criteria; adding two new 
certification criteria in the current (f) 
certification criteria for birth reporting 
and bi-directional exchange with a 
prescription drug monitoring program 
(PDMP); and adopting new certification 
criteria for health IT for public health in 
§ 170.315(f)(21) through (29). In 
addition, adopt a new certification 
criterion for a standardized FHIR-based 
API for public health data exchange in 
§ 170.315(g)(20), which we also 
proposed to adopt as part of the Base 
EHR definition. 
€Dynamic Client Registration Protocol. Add requirements to support dynamic client registration and 
subsequent authentication and 
authorization for dynamically registered 
apps for patient-facing, user-facing, and 
system confidential applications. 
Specifically, add these requirements to: 
Æ§ 170.315(g)(10) certification criterion; 
Æ§ 170.315(g)(20), (30), and (32) through (35) proposed certification 
criteria; 
Æ§ 170.315(j)(2), (5), (8), and (11) proposed certification criteria; and 
ÆAPI Conditions and Maintenance of Certification requirements in § 170.404. 
€Modular API Capabilities. Add a new paragraph (j) to § 170.315 titled 
‘‘modular API capabilities.’’

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS60604 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Proposed Rules Note: We finalized two new criteria: ‘‘workflow triggers for decision support 
interventions—clients’’ (45 CFR 
170.315(j)(20)) and ‘‘subscriptions—client’’ 
(45 CFR 170.315(j)(21)) in the HTI–4 Final 
Rule. 
€Patient, Provider, and Payer APIs. Adopt a set of certification criteria in 45 
CFR 170.315(g)(30) through (36) to 
support data exchange between 
healthcare payers, providers, and 
patients. 
Note: We adopted electronic prior authorization criteria in 45 CFR 
170.315(g)(31), (32), and (33) in the HTI–4 
Final Rule based on the capabilities 
originally proposed in the HTI–2 Proposed 
Rule for the ‘‘prior authorization API— 
provider’’ certification criterion (45 CFR 
170.315(g)(34)). 
€Conditions and Maintenance of Certification. Revise the Insights and Attestations Conditions and 
Maintenance of Certification 
requirements. 
€Definitions in 45 CFR 171.102. Revise the definition of ‘‘health care 
provider’’ and add definitions for 
‘‘business day or business days’’ and 
‘‘health information technology.’’ 
€Interference. Add a new section (45 CFR 171.104) to codify certain practices 
that constitute ‘‘interference’’ and 
‘‘interfere with’’ (as defined in 
§ 171.102) for purposes of the 
information blocking definition in 
§ 171.103. 
€Requestor Preferences Exception. Adopt a new exception in § 171.304 for 
actors limiting, when asked to by a 
requestor, how much EHI is made 
available to that requestor, including 
when and/or under what conditions the 
EHI is made available. 
€Infeasibility Exception— Responding to Requests Condition. 
Modify the responding to requests 
condition (§ 171.204(b)) to clarify 
timeframes for telling requestors why 
requested access, exchange, or use of 
EHI is not feasible.

Fisheries of the Northeastern United 
States; Amendment 21 to the Atlantic 
Surfclam and Ocean Quahog Fishery 
Management Plan 
AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 
Commerce. 
ACTION: Notice of availability of proposed fishery management plan 
amendment; request for comments. 
SUMMARY: NMFS announces that the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management 
Council has submitted Amendment 21 
to the Atlantic Surfclam and Ocean 
Quahog Fishery Management Plan for 
review and approval by the Secretary of 
Commerce. We are requesting comments 
from the public on the amendment. 
Amendment 21, also known as the 
Species Separation Requirements 
Amendment, would allow both 
surfclams and ocean quahogs to be 
landed on the same fishing trip. To 
ensure accurate accounting for the 
catch, the amendment would also 
implement additional monitoring and 
reporting requirements, both at sea and 
at the dealer where the mixed catch 
would be sorted. 
DATES: Comments must be received on or before February 27, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: You may submit comments on this document, identified by NOAA–

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: We are soliciting public comments on 
Amendment 21, also known as the 
Species Separation Requirements 
Amendment, and its incorporated 
documents through the end of the 
comment period stated in this notice of 
availability. All comments received by 
February 27, 2026, will be considered in 
the approval/disapproval decision on 
the amendment. To be considered, 
comments must be received by close of 
business on the last day of the comment 
period. Comments received after that 
date will not be considered in the 
decision to approve or disapprove 
Amendment 21, including those 
postmarked or otherwise transmitted by 
the last day of the comment period. If 
the amendment is approved, a proposed 
rule would be published in the Federal 
Register at a later date with an opportunity for public comment on the 
specific regulatory changes being 
proposed. 
The Mid-Atlantic Fishery 
Management Council developed this 
amendment at the request of members of 
the commercial surfclam fishing 
industry who were increasingly 
encountering a mix of surfclams and 
ocean quahogs on the same fishing trip. 
When the Council adopted an 
Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) 
management system for the surfclam 
and ocean quahog fisheries in 1990, 
regulations were adopted that 
prohibited landing both species on the 
same trip. This provision simplified 
enforcement of the new ITQ system and 
had minimal impact on the fishery as 
the two species were geographically 
separated. Surfclams were 
predominantly found in shallower water 
and ocean quahogs occupied deeper 
waters farther offshore. As ocean bottom

population has progressively shifted 
offshore and into deeper water. Juvenile 
surfclams have increasingly settled on, 
and grown to maturity on top of, 
existing beds of the much longer-lived 
ocean quahogs. Because of the high 
volume and industrial nature of this 
fishery, it is impractical to thoroughly 
sort the catch on board the vessel. As a 
result, the industry asserts that it has 
been effectively unable to fish in a 
sizable and growing area. 
The measures approved by the 
Council in Amendment 21 would allow 
vessels to land both surfclams and 
ocean quahogs on the same fishing trip. 
The landed catch would be sorted after 
it arrives at the dealer’s processing 
facility. To ensure accurate accounting 
for catch, including landings and 
discards of both species under the ITQ 
system, Amendment 21 calls for the 
creation of a new monitoring program 
within dealer processing facilities. It 
also calls for additional at-sea observer 
coverage up to an initial target coverage 
of 5 percent of all clam dredge fishing 
trips. The additional monitoring would 
be funded by the industry through cost 
recovery. The Magnuson-Stevens 
Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act authorizes the government to collect 
a fee to recover the actual costs directly 
related to management, data collection, 
and enforcement of any limited access 
privilege program, such as the surfclam 
and ocean quahog ITQ program. This fee 
cannot exceed three percent of the ex- 
vessel value of the fish harvested under 
the program. 
Additional details of the proposed 
measures are available in the 
amendment document. Specific 
regulatory changes to implement this 
amendment, if approved, would be 
detailed in a future proposed rule that 
would include an additional 
opportunity for public comment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Title: New Swine Inspection System. OMB Number: 0583–0171. 
Type of request: Renewal of an 
approved information collection. 
Abstract: FSIS has been delegated the authority to exercise the functions of the 
Secretary (7 CFR 2.18, 2.53) as specified 
in the Federal Meat Inspection Act 
(FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601, et seq.). This 
statute mandates that FSIS protect the 
public by verifying that meat and meat 
products are safe, wholesome, and 
properly labeled. 
FSIS is requesting a renewal of the 
approved information collection 
regarding swine slaughter inspection. 
The approval for this information 
collection will expire on February 28, 
2026. FSIS is making no changes to the 
information collection. 
FSIS requires that all swine slaughter 
establishments operating under the New 
Swine Slaughter Inspection System 
(NSIS) monitor their systems through 
microbial testing and recordkeeping. 
Swine slaughter establishments 
operating under NSIS must also 
maintain records to document the total 
number of animals and carcasses sorted 
and removed per day and the reasons 
for their removal. Swine slaughter 
establishments may record their 
disposition data on FSIS Form 6200–3, 
Establishment Sorting Record, or 
provide the same information as 
requested on the form electronically if it 
is submitted in a format approved by 
FSIS. 
FSIS has made the following 
estimates based upon an information 
collection assessment: 
Estimate of burden: The public 
reporting burden for this collection of 
information is estimated to average .048 
hours per response. 
Estimated total number of 
respondents: 84. Estimated annual number of 
responses: 91,078. Estimated total annual burden on 
respondents: 4,348 hours. All responses to this notice will be 
summarized and included in the request 
for OMB approval. All comments will 
also become a matter of public record.

Utah 
Boart Longyear Company submitted a 
notification of proposed production 
activity to the FTZ Board (the Board) for 
its facility in West Valley City, Utah, 
within FTZ 30. The notification 
conforming to the requirements of the 
Board’s regulations (15 CFR 400.22) was 
received on December 2, 2025. 
Pursuant to 15 CFR 400.14(b), FTZ 
production activity would be limited to 
the specific foreign-status material(s)/ 
component(s) and specific finished 
product(s) described in the submitted 
notification (summarized below) and 
subsequently authorized by the Board. 
The benefits that may stem from 
conducting production activity under 
FTZ procedures are explained in the 
background section of the Board’s 
website—accessible via www.trade.gov/

The proposed finished product is 
diamond drill bits (duty rate 5.0%). 
The proposed foreign-status 
materials/components include graphite 
rods for machining into molds, graphite 
molds, synthetic industrial diamonds 
used for drill bits, diamond powder, and 
tungsten powder (duty rate ranges from 
duty-free to 7.0%). The request 
indicates that certain materials/ 
components are subject to duties under 
section 1702(a)(1)(B) of the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act 
(section 1702), or section 301 of the 
Trade Act of 1974 (section 301), 
depending on the country of origin. The 
applicable section 1702 and section 301 
decisions require subject merchandise 
to be admitted to FTZs in privileged 
foreign (PF) status (19 CFR 146.41). The 
request also indicates that graphite rods 
are subject to an antidumping/ 
countervailing duty (AD/CVD) order/ 
investigation if imported from the 
People’s Republic of China. The Board’s 
regulations (15 CFR 400.13(c)(2)) require 
that merchandise subject to AD/CVD 
orders, or items which would be 
otherwise subject to suspension of 
liquidation under AD/CVD procedures 
if they entered U.S. customs territory, be

Analysis of Subsidy Programs and 
Comments Received 
The subsidy programs under 
investigation and the issues raised in 
the case and rebuttal briefs that were 
submitted by interested parties in this 
investigation are discussed in the Issues 
and Decision Memorandum. For a list of 
the issues raised by interested parties 
and addressed in the Issues and 
Decision Memorandum, see Appendix II. 
Methodology 
Commerce conducted this 
investigation in accordance with section 
701 of the Act. For each of the subsidy 
programs found to be countervailable, 
Commerce determines that there is a 
subsidy, i.e., a financial contribution by an ‘‘authority’’ that gives rise to a 
benefit to the recipient, and that the 
subsidy is specific. For a full 
description of the methodology 
underlying our final determination, see 
the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
In making this final determination, 
Commerce relied, in part, on facts 
otherwise available, including with an 
adverse inference, pursuant to sections 
776(a) and (b) of the Act. For a further 
discussion of our application of adverse 
facts available (AFA), see the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
Changes Since the Preliminary 
Determination 
Based on our findings at verification, 
we made changes to our subsidy rate 
calculations for ACG Brazil for the 
provision of electricity for less-than- 
adequate-remuneration program, as well 
as the Ex-Tarifa´rio program. For a 
discussion of these changes, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
All-Others Rate 
Section 705(c)(5)(A)(i) of the Act 
states that, for companies not 
individually investigated, Commerce 
will determine an all-others rate equal 
to the weighted-average countervailable 
subsidy rates established for exporters 
and/or producers individually 
investigated, excluding any zero and de 
minimis countervailable subsidy rates, and any rates determined entirely under 
section 776 of the Act. 
Commerce calculated an individual 
estimated countervailable subsidy rate 
for ACG Brazil, the only individually 
examined exporter/producer in this 
investigation. Because the only 
individually calculated rate is not zero, 
de minimis, or based entirely on facts 
otherwise available, the estimated 
countervailable subsidy rate calculated 
for ACG Brazil is the rate assigned to all 
other producers and exporters, pursuant 
to section 705(c)(5)(A)(i) of the Act. 
Final Determination 
Commerce determines that the 
following estimated countervailable 
subsidy rates exist for the period 
January 1, 2023, through December 31, 
2023:

See Preliminary Determination, 90 FR at 14236. 
Suspension of Liquidation 
As a result of our Preliminary 
Determination, and pursuant to sections 703(d)(1)(B) and (d)(2) of the Act, we 
instructed U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) to collect cash deposits 
and suspend liquidation of entries of 
subject merchandise from Brazil that 
were entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption, on or after 
March 31, 2025, the date of the 
publication of the Preliminary 
Determination in the Federal Register.11
 
In accordance with section 703(d) of the 
Act, we instructed CBP to discontinue 
the suspension of liquidation of all 
entries of subject merchandise entered 
or withdrawn from warehouse, on or 
after July 29, 2025, but to continue the 
suspension of liquidation of all entries 
of subject merchandise on or before July 
28, 2025. 
If the U.S. International Trade 
Commission (ITC) issues a final 
affirmative injury determination, we 
will issue a countervailing duty (CVD) 
order, reinstate the suspension of 
liquidation under section 706(a) of the 
Act, and require a cash deposit of 
estimated countervailing duties for 
entries of subject merchandise in the 
amounts indicated above. Pursuant to 
section 705(c)(2) of the Act, if the ITC 
determines that material injury, or 
threat of material injury, does not exist, 
this proceeding will be terminated, and 
all estimated duties deposited or 
securities posted as a result of the 
suspension of liquidation will be 
refunded or cancelled. 
ITC Notification 
In accordance with section 705(d) of 
the Act, Commerce will notify the ITC 
of its final affirmative determination 
that countervailable subsidies are being 
provided to producers and exporters of 
capsules from Brazil. As Commerce’s 
final determination is affirmative, in 
accordance with section 705(b) of the 
Act, the ITC will determine, within 45 
days, whether the domestic industry in 
the United States is materially injured, 
or threatened with material injury, by 
reason of import of capsules from Brazil. 
In addition, we are making available to 
the ITC all non-privileged and non- 
proprietary information in our files, 
provided the ITC confirms that it will 
not disclose such information, either 
publicly or under administrative 
protective order (APO), without the 
written consent of the Assistant 
Secretary for Enforcement and 
Compliance. 
If the ITC determines that material 
injury or threat of material injury does 
not exist, this proceeding will be 
terminated, and all cash deposits will be 
refunded. If the ITC determines that 
such injury does exist, Commerce will 
issue a CVD order directing CBP to 
assess, upon further instruction by 
Commerce, countervailing duties on all 
imports of the subject merchandise that 
are entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption on or after 
the effective date of the suspension of 
liquidation, as discussed above in the 
‘‘Suspension of Liquidation’’ section. 
Administrative Protective Order 
This notice will serve as the final 
reminder to parties subject to an APO of 
their responsibility concerning the 
destruction of proprietary information 
disclosed under APO, in accordance 
with 19 CFR 351.305(a)(3). Timely 
written notification of the return or 
destruction of APO materials or 
conversion to judicial protective order is 
hereby requested. Failure to comply 
with the regulations and terms of an 
APO is a violation which is subject to 
sanction. 
Notification to Interested Parties 
This determination is issued and 
published in accordance with sections 
705(d) and 777(i) of the Act, and 19 CFR 
351.210(c).

Appendix I 
Scope of the Investigation 
The merchandise subject to the scope of 
this investigation is hard empty capsules, 
which are comprised of two prefabricated, 
hollowed cylindrical sections (cap and body). 
The cap and body pieces each have one 
closed and rounded end and one open end, 
and are constructed with different or equal 
diameters at their open ends. 
Hard empty capsules are unfilled 
cylindrical shells composed of at least 80 
percent by weight of a water soluble polymer 
that is considered non-toxic and appropriate 
for human or animal consumption by the 
United States Pharmacopeia—National 
Formulary (USP–NF), Food Chemical Codex 
(FCC), or equivalent standards. The most 
common polymer materials in hard empty 
capsules are gelatin derived from animal 
collagen (including, but not limited to, pig, 
cow, or fish collagen), hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose (HPMC), and pullulan. 
Hard empty capsules may also contain 
water and additives, such as opacifiers, 
colorants, processing aids, controlled release 
agents, plasticizers, and preservatives. Hard 
empty capsules may also be imprinted or 
otherwise decorated with markings. 
Hard empty capsules are covered by the 
scope of this investigation regardless of 
polymer material, additives, transparency, 
opacity, color, imprinting, or other markings. 
Hard empty capsules are also covered by 
the scope of this investigation regardless of 
their size, weight, length, diameter, 
thickness, and filling capacity. 
Cap and body pieces of hard empty 
capsules are covered by the scope of this 
investigation regardless of whether they are 
imported together or separately, and 
regardless of whether they are imported in 
attached or detached form. 
Hard empty capsules covered by the scope 
of this investigation are those that 
disintegrate in water, simulated intestinal 
fluid, simulated gastric fluid, or other similar 
water-based (i.e., aqueous) fluids within 2 hours under tests specified in Chapter 701 of 
the USP–NF, or equivalent disintegration 
tests. 
Hard empty capsules are classifiable under 
subheadings 9602.00.1040 and 9602.00.5010 
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States (HTSUS). In addition, hard 
empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 1905.90.9090; gelatin 
hard empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 3503.00.5510; HPMC 
hard empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 3923.90.0080; and 
pullulan hard empty capsules may be 
imported under HTSUS subheading 
2106.90.9998. Although the HTSUS 
subheadings are provided for convenience 
and customs purposes, the written 
description of the merchandise covered by 
this investigation is dispositive.

Hard Empty Capsules From Brazil: 
Final Affirmative Determination of 
Sales at Less Than Fair Value 
AGENCY: Enforcement and Compliance, International Trade Administration, 
Department of Commerce. 
SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that 
hard empty capsules (capsules) from 
Brazil are being, or are likely to be, sold 
in the United States at less than fair 
value (LTFV), as provided in section 
735 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended (the Act), for the period of 
investigation October 1, 2023, through 
September 30, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On May 29, 2025, Commerce 
published in the Federal Register its 
preliminary affirmative determination 
in the LTFV investigation of capsules 
from Brazil, in which it also postponed 
the final determination until October 14, 
2025.
1
On August 7, 2025, Commerce 
issued a post-preliminary analysis 
memorandum in which it made certain 
changes to its differential pricing 
analysis.
2
We invited interested parties 
to comment on the Preliminary 
Determination and changes to the differential pricing analysis.
3
 
Due to the lapse in appropriations and 
Federal Government shutdown, on 
November 14, 2025, Commerce tolled 
all deadlines in administrative 
proceedings by 47 days.
4
Additionally, 
due to a backlog of documents that were 
electronically filed via Enforcement and 
Compliance’s Antidumping and 
Countervailing Duty Centralized 
Electronic Service System (ACCESS) 
during the Federal Government 
shutdown, on November 24, 2025, 
Commerce tolled all deadlines in 
administrative proceedings by an 
additional 21 days.
5
Accordingly, the 
deadline for this final determination is 
now December 18, 2025. 
A summary of the events that 
occurred since the Preliminary 
Determination, as well as a full discussion of the issues raised by parties 
for this final determination, may be 
found in the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum.

The Issues and Decision 
Memorandum is a public document and 
is on file electronically via ACCESS. 
ACCESS is available to registered users 
at https://access.trade.gov. In addition, a complete version of the Issues and 
Decision Memorandum can be accessed 
directly at https://access.trade.gov/ 
public/FRNoticesListLayout.aspx. 
Scope of the Investigation 
The products covered by this 
investigation are capsules from Brazil. 
For a complete description of the scope 
of this investigation, see Appendix I. Scope Comments 
In the Preliminary Scope 
Memorandum, we set aside a period of 
time for parties to raise issues regarding 
product coverage (i.e., scope) in scope- specific case briefs or other written 
comments.
7
We received scope case and 
rebuttal briefs from multiple interested 
parties. For a summary of the product 
coverage comments and rebuttal 
responses submitted to the record for 
this final determination, and 
accompanying discussion and analysis 
of all comments timely received, see the Final Scope Memorandum.
8
In the Final 
Scope Memorandum, Commerce 
determined that it is modifying the 
scope language as it appeared in the 
Initiation Notice.
9
See Appendix I. Verification 
Commerce conducted verification of 
the information relied upon in making 
its final determination in this 
investigation, in accordance with 
section 782(i) of the Act. Specifically, 
we conducted on-site verifications of 
the sales and cost information submitted 
by ACG do Brasil S.A. (ACG Brazil), for 
use in our final determination. We used 
standard verification procedures, 
including an examination of relevant 
sales and accounting records, and 
original source documents provided by 
ACG Brazil. 
Analysis of Comments Received 
All issues raised in the case brief 
submitted by ACG Brazil in this 
investigation are addressed in the Issues 
and Decision Memorandum. A list of 
the issues addressed in the Issues and 
Decision Memorandum is attached to 
this notice as Appendix II. 
Changes Since the Preliminary 
Determination 
We made certain changes to the 
dumping margin calculation for ACG 
Brazil since the Preliminary 
Determination and Post-Preliminary Analysis. For a discussion of these 
changes, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
All-Others Rate 
Section 735(c)(5)(A) of the Act 
provides that Commerce shall determine 
an estimated all-others rate for all 
exporters and producers not 
individually examined. This rate shall 
be an amount equal to the weighted 
average of the estimated weighted- 
average dumping margins established 
for producers and exporters 
individually investigated, excluding any 
zero and de minimis margins, and any 
margins determined entirely under 
section 776 of the Act. 
Commerce calculated an individual 
estimated weighted-average dumping 
margin for ACG Brazil, the only 
individually examined producer/ 
exporter in this investigation, that is not 
zero, de minimis, or based entirely on facts otherwise available. Therefore, we 
assigned the estimated weighted-average 
dumping margin that we calculated for 
ACG Brazil to all other producers and

To determine the cash deposit rate, Commerce 
normally adjusts the estimated weighted-average 
dumping margin by the amount of export subsidies 
countervailed in a companion countervailing duty 
(CVD) proceeding, when CVD provisional measures 
are in effect. Accordingly, where Commerce has 
made a final affirmative determination for 
countervailable export subsidies, Commerce offsets 
the estimated weighted-average dumping margin by 
the appropriate CVD rate. However, in the final 
determination of the companion CVD investigation 
of capsules from Brazil, we found no export 
subsidies. See unpublished Federal Register notice entitled, ‘‘Hard Empty Capsules from Brazil: Final 
Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination,’’ 
signed and dated concurrently with this Federal 
Register notice. Therefore, Commerce has not adjusted the antidumping duty cash deposit rate for 
export subsidies in the companion CVD 
investigation.

Commerce intends to disclose the 
calculations and analysis performed in 
connection with this final determination 
to interested parties within five days of 
any public announcement or, if there is 
no public announcement, within five 
days of the date of publication of this 
notice in the Federal Register, in 
accordance with 19 CFR 351.224(b). 
Suspension of Liquidation 
In accordance with section 
733(d)(1)(B) of the Act, we instructed 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) to suspend liquidation of all 
entries of subject merchandise, as 
described in Appendix I of this notice, 
which were entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption on or after 
May 29, 2025, the date of publication of 
the Preliminary Determination in the Federal Register. In accordance with 
section 733(d) of the Act, we instructed 
CBP to discontinue the suspension of 
liquidation of all entries of subject 
merchandise entered or withdrawn from 
warehouse, on or after November 25, 
2025, but to continue the suspension of 
liquidation of all entries of subject 
merchandise on or before November 24, 
2025. 
If the U.S. International Trade 
Commission (ITC) issues a final 
affirmative injury determination, we 
will issue an antidumping duty order, 
reinstate the suspension of liquidation 
under section 736(a) of the Act, and 
require a cash deposit of estimated 
antidumping duties for such entries of 
subject merchandise in the amounts 
indicated above, in accordance with 
section 736(a) of the Act. If the ITC 
determines that material injury, or 
threat of material injury, does not exist, 
then this proceeding will be terminated, 
the suspension of liquidation will be 
lifted, and all cash deposits for 
estimated antidumping duties will be 
refunded. 
ITC Notification 
In accordance with section 735(d) of 
the Act, Commerce will notify the ITC 
of its final affirmative determination of 
sales at LTFV. Because Commerce’s 
final determination is affirmative, in 
accordance with section 735(b)(2) of the 
Act, the ITC will make its final 
determination as to whether the 
domestic industry in the United States 
is materially injured, or threatened with 
material injury, by reason of imports, or 
sales (or the likelihood of sales) for 
importation, of capsules no later than 45 
days after this final determination. If the 
ITC determines that material injury or 
threat of material injury does not exist, 
this proceeding will be terminated, all 
cash deposits will be refunded or 
canceled, and suspension of liquidation 
will be lifted. If the ITC determines that 
such injury does exist, Commerce will 
issue an antidumping duty order 
directing CBP to assess, upon further 
instructions by Commerce, antidumping 
duties on all imports of the subject 
merchandise that are entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse, for 
consumption on or after the effective 
date of the suspension of liquidation, as 
discussed above in the ‘‘Suspension of 
Liquidation’’ section. 
Administrative Protective Order (APO) 
This notice serves as the only 
reminder to parties subject to an APO of 
their responsibility concerning the 
disposition of proprietary information 
disclosed under APO in accordance 
with 19 CFR 351.305(a)(3). Timely 
written notification of the return or 
destruction of APO materials or 
conversion to judicial protective order is 
hereby requested. Failure to comply 
with the regulations and terms of an 
APO is a sanctionable violation. 
Notification To Interested Parties

published in accordance with sections 
735(d) and 777(i) of the Act, and 19 CFR 
351.210(c).

submitted comments, the only 
modification we have made from the 
Preliminary Determination is to 
incorporate a finding from the cost 
verification and rely on a revised cost 
database obtained following issuance of 
the Preliminary Determination.2
 
Accordingly, an analysis memorandum 
accompanies this Federal Register 
notice.
3
 
Due to the lapse in appropriations and 
Federal Government shutdown, on 
November 14, 2025, Commerce tolled 
all deadlines in administrative 
proceedings by 47 days.
4
Additionally, 
due to a backlog of documents that were 
electronically filed via Enforcement and 
Compliance’s Antidumping and 
Countervailing Duty Centralized 
Electronic Service System (ACCESS) 
during the Federal Government 
shutdown, on November 24, 2025, 
Commerce tolled all deadlines in 
administrative proceedings by an 
additional 21 days.
5
Accordingly, the 
deadline for this final determination is 
now December 18, 2025. 
Scope of the Investigation 
The products covered by this 
investigation are paper file folders from 
Cambodia. For a complete description of 
the scope of this investigation, see the appendix to this notice. 
Scope Comments 
No interested party commented on the 
scope of the investigation as it appeared 
in the Preliminary Determination. 
Therefore, no changes were made to the 
scope of the investigation. 
Verification 
As provided in section 782(i) of the 
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), 
in June 2025, we conducted verification 
of information submitted by Three-Color 
Stone Stationery (Cambodia) Co., Ltd. 
(TCS) for use in our final determination. 
We used standard verification 
procedures, including an examination of 
relevant accounting records and original 
source documents provided by TCS.

Changes Since the Preliminary 
Determination 
As noted above, we have incorporated 
certain changes in our final margin 
calculations for TCS. Specifically, we 
are: (1) relying on a revised cost 
database submitted by TCS following 
the Preliminary Determination, and (2) revising TCS’s general and 
administrative expense ratio to include 
certain expenses related to other non- 
operating expenses as a result of a 
finding made during our cost 
verification. We are making no other 
changes from the Preliminary 
Determination. For a discussion of these changes, see the TCS Final Analysis Memorandum. 
Final Determination 
Commerce determines that the 
following estimated weighted-average 
dumping margin exists:

See Memorandum, ‘‘Single-Entity Analysis for Three-Color Stone Stationery (Cambodia) Co., Ltd. 
and Affiliated Companies,’’ dated May 21, 2025

estimated weighted-average dumping 
margin for all other producers and 
exporters pursuant to sections 
735(c)(1)(B) and (c)(5) of the Act, 
because it has not made an affirmative 
final determination of sales at LTFV. 
Disclosure 
Commerce intends to disclose the 
calculations performed in connection 
with this final determination to 
interested parties within five days of 
any public announcement or, if there is 
no public announcement, within five 
days of the date of publication of this 
notice in the Federal Register, in 
accordance with 19 CFR 351.224(b). 
Suspension of Liquidation 
In the Preliminary Determination, we 
calculated an estimated weighted- 
average dumping margin for TCS that 
was zero percent and, therefore, we did 
not suspend liquidation of entries of 
paper file folders from Cambodia.8 
Because Commerce has made a negative 
final determination of sales at LTFV, we 
will not direct U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection to suspend liquidation or to 
require cash deposits of estimated 
antidumping duties for entries of paper 
file folders from Cambodia. 
U.S. International Trade Commission 
(ITC) Notification 
In accordance with section 735(d) of 
the Act, Commerce will notify the ITC 
of its negative final determination of 
sales at LTFV. Because the final 
determination is negative, this 
proceeding is terminated in accordance 
with section 735(c)(2) of the Act. 
Administrative Protective Order (APO) 
This notice will serve as the only 
reminder to parties subject to an APO of 
their responsibility concerning the 
destruction of proprietary information 
disclosed under APO, in accordance 
with 19 CFR 351.305(a)(3). Timely 
written notification of the return or 
destruction of APO materials or 
conversion to judicial protective order is 
hereby requested. Failure to comply 
with the regulations and terms of an 
APO is a violation which is subject to 
sanction. 
Notification to Interested Parties 
This determination is issued and 
published pursuant to sections 735(d) 
and 777(i) of the Act, and 19 CFR

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On May 29, 2025, Commerce 
published in the Federal Register its 
preliminary affirmative determination 
in the LTFV investigation of capsules 
from India, in which it also postponed 
the final determination until October 14, 
2025.
1
On September 5, 2025, 
Commerce issued a post-preliminary 
analysis memorandum in which it made 
certain changes to its differential pricing 
analysis.
2
We invited interested parties 
to comment on the Preliminary 
Determination and changes to the differential pricing analysis.
3
 
Due to the lapse in appropriations and 
Federal Government shutdown, on 
November 14, 2025, Commerce tolled 
all deadlines in administrative 
proceedings by 47 days.
4
Additionally, 
due to a backlog of documents that were 
electronically filed via Enforcement and 
Compliance’s Antidumping and 
Countervailing Duty Centralized 
Electronic Service System (ACCESS) 
during the Federal Government 
shutdown, on November 24, 2025, 
Commerce tolled all deadlines in 
administrative proceedings by an 
additional 21 days.
5
Accordingly, the 
deadline for this final results 
determination is now December 18, 
2025. 
A summary of the events that 
occurred since Commerce published the 
Preliminary Determination, as well as a 
full discussion of the issues raised by 
parties for this final determination, may 
be found in the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum.
6
The Issues and Decision 
Memorandum is a public document and 
is on file electronically via Enforcement 
and Compliance’s Antidumping and 
Countervailing Duty Centralized 
Electronic Service System (ACCESS). 
ACCESS is available to registered users 
at https://access.trade.gov. In addition, a complete version of the Issues and 
Decision Memorandum can be accessed 
directly at https://access.trade.gov/ 
public/FRNoticesListLayout.aspx. 
Scope of the Investigation 
The products covered by this 
investigation are capsules from India. 
For a complete description of the scope 
of this investigation, see Appendix I. Scope Comments 
In the Preliminary Scope 
Memorandum, we set aside a period of 
time for parties to raise issues regarding 
product coverage (i.e., scope) in scope- specific case briefs or other written 
comments.
7
We received scope case and 
rebuttal briefs from multiple interested 
parties. For a summary of the product 
coverage comments and rebuttal 
responses submitted to the record for 
this final determination, and 
accompanying discussion and analysis 
of all comments timely received, see the Final Scope Memorandum.
8
In the Final 
Scope Memorandum, Commerce 
determined that it is modifying the 
scope language as it appeared in the 
Initiation Notice.
9
See Appendix I. Verification 
Commerce conducted verification of 
the information relied upon in making 
its final determination in this 
investigation, in accordance with 
section 782(i) of the Act. Specifically, 
we conducted on-site verifications of 
the sales and cost information submitted 
by ACG Associated Capsules Private 
Limited (ACG India) and HealthCaps 
India Limited (HIL).
10
We used standard 
verification procedures, including an 
examination of relevant sales and 
accounting records, and original source 
documents provided by ACG India and 
HIL. 
Analysis of Comments Received 
All issues raised in the case briefs 
submitted by interested parties in this 
investigation are addressed in the Issues 
and Decision Memorandum. A list of 
the issues addressed in the Issues and 
Decision Memorandum is attached to 
this notice as Appendix II. 
Changes Since the Preliminary 
Determination 
We made certain changes to the 
dumping margin calculations for ACG 
India and HIL since the Preliminary 
Determination and Post-Preliminary Analysis. In addition, Commerce has 
relied on adverse facts available under 
sections 776(a) of the Act for ACG India. 
For a discussion of these changes, see 
the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
All-Others Rate 
Section 735(c)(5)(A) of the Act 
provides that Commerce shall determine 
an estimated all-others rate for all 
exporters and producers not 
individually examined. This rate shall 
be an amount equal to the weighted 
average of the estimated weighted- 
average dumping margins established 
for exporters and producers 
individually investigated, excluding any 
zero and de minimis dumping margins, 
and any margins determined entirely 
under section 776 of the Act. 
Commerce calculated individual 
estimated weighted-average dumping 
margins for ACG India and HIL that are 
not zero, de minimis, or based entirely 
on facts otherwise available. Publicly- 
ranged total U.S. sales values are not 
available for each of the companies 
examined in this investigation.

With two respondents under examination, 
Commerce normally calculates: (A) a weighted- 
average of the estimated weighted-average dumping 
margins calculated for the examined respondents; 
(B) a simple average of the estimated weighted- 
average dumping margins calculated for the 
examined respondents; and (C) a weighted-average 
of the estimated weighted-average dumping margins 
calculated for the examined respondents using each 
company’s publicly-ranged U.S. sales values for the 
merchandise under consideration. Commerce then 
compares (B) and (C) to (A) and selects the rate 
closest to (A) as the most appropriate rate for all 
other producers and exporters. See, e.g., Ball 
Bearings and Parts Thereof from France, Germany, 
Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom: Final Results 
of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews, Final 
Results of Changed-Circumstances Review, and 
Revocation of an Order in Part, 75 FR 53661, 53662 
(September 1, 2010), and accompanying Issues and 
Decision Memorandum at Comment 1. Publicly- 
ranged total U.S. sales values are not available for 
each of the companies examined in this 
investigation. Accordingly, we cannot calculate an 
estimated weighted-average dumping margin based 
on a weighted-average to consider applying to the 
non-examined respondents in this investigation. 
Instead, we have determined to calculate the simple 
average of the estimated weighted-average dumping 
margins calculated for the examined companies to 
the companies not selected for individual 
examination in this investigation. For a complete 
analysis of the data, see Memorandum, ‘‘Final 
Determination All-Others Rate Calculation,’’ dated 
concurrently with this notice. 
12
In the Preliminary Determination, Commerce 
preliminarily determined that these companies are 
a single entity. See Preliminary Determination PDM 
at 4–5; see also Memorandum, ‘‘Preliminary 
Affiliation and Collapsing Analysis Memorandum,’’ 
dated April 21, 2025. No parties commented on this 
determination; thus, we continue to treat these 
companies as a single entity for purposes of this 
final determination. 
13
See Preliminary Determination PDM at 18. 
Therefore, Commerce calculated the 
estimated weighted-average dumping 
margin for all-other producers and 
exporters using a simple average of the 
estimated weighted-average dumping 
margins calculated for the examined 
respondents.
11
 
Final Determination 
Commerce determines that the 
following estimated weighted-average 
dumping margins exist:

Commerce intends to disclose the 
calculations and analysis performed in 
connection with this final determination 
to interested parties within five days of 
any public announcement or, if there is 
no public announcement, within five 
days of the date of publication of this 
notice in the Federal Register, in 
accordance with 19 CFR 351.224(b). 
Suspension of Liquidation and Cash 
Deposit Requirements 
In accordance with section 
735(c)(1)(B) of the Act, we instructed 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) to suspend liquidation of all 
entries of subject merchandise, as 
described in Appendix I of this notice, 
which were entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption on or after 
May 29, 2025, the date of publication of 
the Preliminary Determination in the Federal Register. In accordance with 
section 733(d) of the Act, we instructed 
CBP to discontinue the suspension of 
liquidation of all entries of subject 
merchandise entered or withdrawn from 
warehouse, on or after November 25, 
2025, but to continue the suspension of 
liquidation of all entries of subject 
merchandise on or before November 24, 
2025. 
If the U.S. International Trade 
Commission (ITC) publishes an 
affirmative final injury determination, 
then Commerce will publish an 
antidumping duty order, reinstate the 
suspension of liquidation under section 
736(a) of the Act, and require a cash 
deposit of estimated antidumping duties 
for entries of subject merchandise in the 
amounts indicated above, in accordance 
with section 736(a) of the Act. If the ITC 
determines that material injury, or 
threat of material injury, does not exist, 
then this proceeding will be terminated, 
the suspension of liquidation will be 
lifted, and all cash deposits for 
estimated antidumping duties will be 
refunded. 
To determine the cash deposit rate, 
Commerce normally adjusts the 
estimated weighted-average dumping 
margin by the amount of export 
subsidies countervailed in a companion 
countervailing duty (CVD) investigation, 
when CVD provisional measures are in 
effect. Accordingly, where Commerce 
made an affirmative determination for 
countervailable export subsidies, 
Commerce would offset the estimated 
weighted-average dumping margins by 
the appropriate export subsidy rate.
13
 
Any such adjusted cash deposit rates 
may be found in the ‘‘Final 
Determination’’ section above. If the 
U.S. International Trade Commission 
(ITC) makes a final affirmative 
determination of injury due to both 
dumping and subsidies, then the cash 
deposit rate will include the offsets for 
the export subsidies collected as part of 
the CVD final determination. 
ITC Notification 
In accordance with section 735(d) of 
the Act, Commerce will notify ITC of its 
final affirmative determination of sales 
at LTFV. Because Commerce’s final 
determination is affirmative, in 
accordance with section 735(b)(2) of the 
Act, the ITC will make its final 
determination as to whether the 
domestic industry in the United States 
is materially injured, or threatened with 
material injury, by reason of imports or 
sales (or the likelihood of sales) of 
capsules for importation from India no 
later than 45 days after this final 
determination. If the ITC determines 
that such injury does not exist, then this 
proceeding will be terminated, all cash 
deposits posted will be refunded, and 
suspension of liquidation will be lifted. 
If the ITC determines that such injury 
does exist, then Commerce will issue an 
antidumping duty order directing CBP 
to assess, upon further instruction by 
Commerce, antidumping duties on all 
imports of the subject merchandise 
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, 
for consumption on or after the effective 
date of the suspension of liquidation, as 
discussed in the ’’ Suspension of 
Liquidation and Cash Deposit 
Requirements’’ section above.

Scope of the Investigation 
The merchandise subject to the scope of 
this investigation is hard empty capsules, 
which are comprised of two prefabricated, 
hollowed cylindrical sections (cap and body). 
The cap and body pieces each have one 
closed and rounded end and one open end, 
and are constructed with different or equal 
diameters at their open ends. 
Hard empty capsules are unfilled 
cylindrical shells composed of at least 80 
percent by weight of a water soluble polymer 
that is considered non-toxic and appropriate 
for human or animal consumption by the 
United States Pharmacopeia—National 
Formulary (USP–NF), Food Chemical Codex 
(FCC), or equivalent standards. The most 
common polymer materials in hard empty 
capsules are gelatin derived from animal 
collagen (including, but not limited to, pig, 
cow, or fish collagen), hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose (HPMC), and pullulan. 
Hard empty capsules may also contain 
water and additives, such as opacifiers, 
colorants, processing aids, controlled release 
agents, plasticizers, and preservatives. Hard 
empty capsules may also be imprinted or 
otherwise decorated with markings. 
Hard empty capsules are covered by the 
scope of these investigations regardless of 
polymer material, additives, transparency, 
opacity, color, imprinting, or other markings. 
Hard empty capsules are also covered by 
the scope of these investigations regardless of 
their size, weight, length, diameter, 
thickness, and filling capacity. 
Cap and body pieces of hard empty 
capsules are covered by the scope of these 
investigations regardless of whether they are 
imported together or separately, and 
regardless of whether they are imported in 
attached or detached form. 
Hard empty capsules covered by the scope 
of these investigations are those that 
disintegrate in water, simulated intestinal 
fluid, simulated gastric fluid, or other similar 
water-based (i.e., aqueous) fluids within 2 hours under tests specified in Chapter 701 of 
the USP–NF, or equivalent disintegration 
tests. 
Hard empty capsules are classifiable under 
subheadings 9602.00.1040 and 9602.00.5010 
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States (HTSUS). In addition, hard 
empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 1905.90.9090; gelatin 
hard empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 3503.00.5510; HPMC 
hard empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 3923.90.0080; and 
pullulan hard empty capsules may be 
imported under HTSUS subheading 
2106.90.9998. Although the HTSUS 
subheadings are provided for convenience 
and customs purposes, the written 
description of the merchandise covered by 
these investigations is dispositive.

Certain Magnesia Carbon Bricks From 
the People’s Republic of China: Notice 
of Court Decision Not in Harmony With 
the Final Determination in Covered 
Merchandise Inquiry; and Notice of 
Amended Final Covered Merchandise 
Inquiry Determination 
AGENCY: Enforcement and Compliance, International Trade Administration, 
Department of Commerce. 
SUMMARY: On October 9, 2025, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) 
issued its final judgment in Fedmet 
Resources Corporation v. United States, Court No. 23–00117, sustaining the U.S. 
Department of Commerce (Commerce)’s 
remand redetermination pertaining to 
the covered merchandise inquiry (CMI) 
related to refractory bricks with added 
alumina. Commerce is notifying the 
public that the CIT’s final judgment is 
not in harmony with Commerce’s final 
determination in that CMI, and that 
Commerce is amending the final CMI 
determination to find that refractory 
bricks with added alumina are excluded 
from the orders. 
DATES: Applicable October 19, 2025. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, 
DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482–3860. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On May 4, 2023, Commerce published 
its Final CMI Determination, which found that refractory bricks with less 
than five percent added alumina were 
magnesia carbon bricks (MCBs) and 
were, thus, covered by the scope of the 
Orders.
1
 
Fedmet Resources Corporation 
appealed Commerce’s Final CMI 
Determination. On December 12, 2024, the CIT remanded the Final CMI 
Determination to Commerce, holding that precedent from the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal 
Circuit) interpreted the scope to not 
specify a cut-off percentage for low 
alumina versus high alumina refractory 
bricks, such that the addition of any 
alumina to an MCB renders the brick 
outside the scope of the Orders.
2
 
In its final remand redetermination, 
issued in March 2025, Commerce found, 
under protest, that MCBs with any 
added alumina were excluded from the 
scope of the Orders.
3
The CIT sustained 
Commerce’s final redetermination.

Timken Notice 
In its decision in Timken,
5
as clarified 
by Diamond Sawblades,6
the Federal 
Circuit held that, pursuant to sections 
516A(c) and (e) of the Tariff Act of 1930, 
as amended (the Act), Commerce must 
publish a notice of court decision that 
is not ‘‘in harmony’’ with a Commerce 
determination and must suspend 
liquidation of entries pending a 
‘‘conclusive’’ court decision. The CIT’s 
October 9, 2025, judgment constitutes a 
final decision of the CIT that is not in 
harmony with Commerce’s Final CMI 
Determination. Thus, this notice is published in fulfillment of the 
publication requirements of Timken. 
Amended Final Determination 
Commerce will instruct U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection (CBP) that, 
pending any appeals, the cash deposit 
rate will be zero percent for refractory 
bricks with any added alumina. In the 
event that the CIT’s final judgment is 
upheld on appeal, Commerce will 
instruct CBP to liquidate entries of 
refractory bricks with added alumina 
without regard to antidumping and 
countervailing duties and to lift 
suspension of liquidation of such 
entries. 
Notification to Interested Parties 
This notice is issued and published in 
accordance with sections 516A(c) and 
(e) and 777(i)(1) of the Act.

notifying the public that the CIT’s final 
judgment is not in harmony with 
Commerce’s final determination in that 
investigation, and that Commerce is 
amending the final determination and 
the resulting AD order with respect to 
the dumping margin assigned to Koehler

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On September 30, 2021, Commerce 
published its Final Determination in the 
AD investigation of thermal paper from 
Germany. Commerce: (1) applied the 
Cohen’s d test as part of its differential pricing analysis;
1
(2) accepted Koehler’s 
reporting of the static sensitivity 
product characteristic in its sales and 
cost databases for all but one product in 
the final determination;
2
and (3) 
recalculated Koehler’s reported 
financial expense ratio to include the 
interest expenses accrued on Koehler’s 
unpaid antidumping duties from the 
revoked LWTP Order.3
Commerce 
subsequently published the AD order on 
thermal paper from Germany.
4
 
Certain parties appealed Commerce’s 
Final Determination. On February 8, 
2024, the CIT remanded the Final 
Determination to Commerce to reconsider or explain: (1) its application 
of the Cohen’s d test to Koehler’s U.S. sales; (2) the coding of the static 
sensitivity product characteristic; and 
(3) the decision not to treat Koehler’s 
accrued interest expenses related to 
unpaid antidumping duties as part of 
indirect selling expenses.
5
 
In its final remand redetermination, 
issued in August 2025, Commerce: (1) 
reconsidered its application of the 
Cohen’s d test as part of its differential pricing analysis; (2) reopened the record 
to provide Koehler with an opportunity 
to remedy its reporting of the static 
sensitivity product characteristic; and 
(3) provided further explanation of the 
inclusion of Koehler’s accrued interest 
expenses related to unpaid antidumping 
duties as part of the financial expense 
ratio in the calculation of the cost of 
production, instead of as U.S. indirect 
selling expenses.
6
The CIT sustained 
Commerce’s final redetermination.

the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held 
that, pursuant to section 516A(c) and (e) 
of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended 
(the Act), Commerce must publish a 
notice of court decision that is not ‘‘in 
harmony’’ with a Commerce 
determination and must suspend 
liquidation of entries pending a 
‘‘conclusive’’ court decision. The CIT’s 
November 20, 2025, judgment 
constitutes a final decision of the CIT 
that is not in harmony with Commerce’s 
Final Determination. Thus, this notice is 
published in fulfillment of the 
publication requirements of Timken. 
Amended Final Determination 
Because there is now a final court 
judgment, Commerce is amending its 
Final Determination as follows:

provided to producers and exporters of 
hard empty capsules (capsules) from 
India. The period of investigation (POI) 
is April 1, 2023, through March 31,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On March 31, 2025, Commerce 
published Preliminary Determination in the Federal Register and invited interested parties to comment.
1
In the 
Preliminary Determination, and in 
accordance with section 705(a)(1) of the 
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), 
and 19 CFR 351.210(b)(4), Commerce 
aligned the final countervailing duty 
(CVD) determination with the final 
determination in the less-than-fair-value 
investigation of capsules from India.
2
 
Due to the lapse in appropriations and 
Federal Government shutdown, on 
November 14, 2025, Commerce tolled 
all deadlines in administrative 
proceedings by 47 days.
3
Additionally, 
due to a backlog of documents that were 
electronically filed via Enforcement and 
Compliance’s Antidumping and 
Countervailing Duty Centralized 
Electronic Service System (ACCESS) 
during the Federal Government 
shutdown, on November 24, 2025, 
Commerce tolled all deadlines in 
administrative proceedings by an 
additional 21 days.
4
Accordingly, the 
deadline for this final determination is 
now December 18, 2025. 
For a complete description of the 
events that followed the Preliminary 
Determination, see the Issues and 
Decision Memorandum.
5
The Issues and 
Decision Memorandum is a public 
document and is made available to the 
public via ACCESS. ACCESS is 
available to registered users at https://
access.trade.gov. In addition, a complete version of the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum can be accessed directly 
at https://access.trade.gov/public/ FRNoticesListLayout.aspx. 
Scope of the Investigation 
The products covered by this 
investigation are hard empty capsules 
from India. For a complete description 
of the scope of the investigation, see 
Appendix I. 
Scope Comments 
In the Preliminary Scope 
Memorandum, we set aside a period of 
time for parties to raise issues regarding 
product coverage (i.e., scope) in scope- specific case briefs or other written 
comments.
6
We received scope case and 
rebuttal briefs from multiple interested 
parties. For a summary of the product 
coverage comments and rebuttal 
responses submitted to the record for 
this final determination, and 
accompanying discussion and analysis 
of all comments timely received, see the Final Scope Memorandum.

In the Final 
Scope Memorandum, Commerce 
determined that it is modifying the 
scope language as it appeared in the 
Initiation Notice.
8
See Appendix I. Verification 
As provided in section 782(i) of the 
Act, in July and August 2025, 
Commerce conducted verification of the 
subsidy information reported by ACG

(ACPL) and its affiliates, ACG Pam 
Pharma Technologies Private Limited 
(ACG PAM) and ACG Universal 
Capsules Private Limited (AUCPL) 
(collectively, ACG).

of the Act regarding benefit; and section 771(5A) of 
the Act regarding specificity. 
the case and rebuttal briefs by parties in 
this investigation, are discussed in the 
Issues and Decision Memorandum. For 
a list of the issues raised by parties, and 
to which we responded in the Issues 
and Decision Memorandum, see 
Appendix II. 
Methodology 
Commerce conducted this 
investigation in accordance with section 
701 of the Act. For each of the subsidy 
programs found to be countervailable, 
Commerce determines that there is a 
subsidy, i.e., a financial contribution by an ‘‘authority’’ that gives rise to a 
benefit to the recipient, and that the 
subsidy is specific.
10
For a full 
description of the methodology 
underlying our final determination, see 
the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
Changes Since the Preliminary 
Determination 
Based on our review and analysis of 
the information received during 
verification and comments received 
from parties, for this final 
determination, we made certain changes 
to the countervailable subsidy rate 
calculations for ACG, and for all other 
producers/exporters. For a discussion of 
these changes, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
All-Others Rate 
Section 705(c)(5)(A) of the Act 
provides that in a final determination, 
Commerce shall determine an estimated 
all-others rate for companies not 
individually examined equal to the 
weighted average of the estimated 
countervailable subsidy rates 
established for exporters and producers 
individually examined, excluding any 
zero or de minimis countervailable 
subsidy rates and any rates based 
entirely under section 776 of the Act 
(facts available). If the individual 
estimated countervailable subsidy rates 
established for all exporters and 
producers individually examined are 
zero, de minimis, or determined entirely 
under section 776 of the Act, section 
705(c)(5)(A)(ii) of the Act provides that 
Commerce may use any reasonable 
method to establish an estimated all- 
others countervailable subsidy rate for 
exporters and producers not 
individually investigated, including 
averaging the weighted average 
countervailable subsidy rates 
determined for the exporters and 
producers individually investigated. 
In this investigation, we continue to 
calculate an individual total net 
countervailable subsidy rate for ACG, 
the only individually examined 
producer/exporter in this investigation, 
that is not zero, de minimis, or based 
entirely on facts otherwise available and 
there are no other countervailable 
subsidy rates on the record. Given these 
facts, Commerce has determined that a 
reasonable method for establishing the 
estimated all-others’ countervailable 
subsidy rate is to assign ACG’s 
estimated countervailable subsidy rate 
to all other producers and exporters. 
Final Determination 
Commerce determines that the 
following estimated net countervailable 
subsidy rates exist for the period April 
1, 2023, through March 31, 2024: 
Company Subsidy rate 
(percent ad valorem) ACG Associated Capsules Private Limited; ACG Pam Pharma Technologies Private Limited; ACG Universal Capsules 
Private Limited ................................................................................................................................................................. 7.06 All Others ............................................................................................................................................................................. 7.06 Disclosure 
Commerce intends to disclose its 
calculations performed to interested 
parties in this final determination 
within five days of its public 
announcement or, if there is no public 
announcement, within five days of the 
date of the publication of this notice in 
the Federal Register, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.224(b). 
Suspension of Liquidation 
As a result of our Preliminary 
Determination, and pursuant to sections 703(d)(1)(B) and (d)(2) of the Act, we 
instructed U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) to collect cash deposits 
and suspend liquidation of entries of 
subject merchandise from India that 
were entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption on or after 
March 31, 2025, the date of publication 
of the Preliminary Determination in the 
Federal Register. In accordance with 
section 703(d) of the Act, we instructed 
CBP to discontinue the suspension of 
liquidation of all entries of subject 
merchandise entered or withdrawn from 
warehouse, on or after July 29, 2025, but 
to continue the suspension of 
liquidation of all entries of subject 
merchandise on or before July 28, 2025. 
If the U.S. International Trade 
Commission (ITC) issues a final 
affirmative injury determination, we 
will issue a CVD order, reinstate the 
suspension of liquidation under section 
706(a) of the Act, and require a cash 
deposit of estimated countervailing 
duties for such entries of subject 
merchandise in the amounts indicated 
above. Pursuant to section 705(c)(2) of 
the Act, if the ITC determines that 
material injury, or threat of material 
injury, does not exist, this proceeding 
will be terminated, and all estimated 
duties deposited or securities posted as 
a result of the suspension of liquidation 
will be refunded or cancelled. 
ITC Notification 
In accordance with section 705(d) of 
the Act, Commerce will notify the ITC 
of its final affirmative determination 
that countervailable subsidies are being 
provided to producers and exporters of

Appendix I 
Scope of the Investigation 
The merchandise subject to the scope of 
this investigation is hard empty capsules, 
which are comprised of two prefabricated, 
hollowed cylindrical sections (cap and body). 
The cap and body pieces each have one 
closed and rounded end and one open end, 
and are constructed with different or equal 
diameters at their open ends. 
Hard empty capsules are unfilled 
cylindrical shells composed of at least 80 
percent by weight of a water soluble polymer 
that is considered non-toxic and appropriate 
for human or animal consumption by the 
United States Pharmacopeia—National 
Formulary (USP–NF), Food Chemical Codex 
(FCC), or equivalent standards. The most 
common polymer materials in hard empty 
capsules are gelatin derived from animal 
collagen (including, but not limited to, pig, 
cow, or fish collagen), hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose (HPMC), and pullulan. 
Hard empty capsules may also contain 
water and additives, such as opacifiers, 
colorants, processing aids, controlled release 
agents, plasticizers, and preservatives. Hard 
empty capsules may also be imprinted or 
otherwise decorated with markings. 
Hard empty capsules are covered by the 
scope of this investigation regardless of 
polymer material, additives, transparency, 
opacity, color, imprinting, or other markings. 
Hard empty capsules are also covered by 
the scope of this investigation regardless of 
their size, weight, length, diameter, 
thickness, and filling capacity. 
Cap and body pieces of hard empty 
capsules are covered by the scope of this 
investigation regardless of whether they are 
imported together or separately, and 
regardless of whether they are imported in 
attached or detached form. 
Hard empty capsules covered by the scope 
of this investigation are those that 
disintegrate in water, simulated intestinal 
fluid, simulated gastric fluid, or other similar 
water-based (i.e., aqueous) fluids within 2 hours under tests specified in Chapter 701 of 
the USP–NF, or equivalent disintegration 
tests. 
Hard empty capsules are classifiable under 
subheadings 9602.00.1040 and 9602.00.5010 
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States (HTSUS). In addition, hard 
empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 1905.90.9090; gelatin 
hard empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 3503.00.5510; HPMC 
hard empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 3923.90.0080; and 
pullulan hard empty capsules may be 
imported under HTSUS subheading 
2106.90.9998. Although the HTSUS 
subheadings are provided for convenience 
and customs purposes, the written 
description of the merchandise covered by 
this investigation is dispositive.

Verification 
As provided in section 782(i) of the 
Act, in May 2025, Commerce conducted 
on-site verifications of the subsidy 
information reported by the Government 
of Vietnam, the Government of Korea, 
Suheung Vietnam Co., Ltd. (Suheung 
Vietnam), and Cuu Long Joint Stock 
Company. We used standard 
verification procedures, including an 
examination of relevant sales and 
accounting records, and original source 
documents provided by the 
respondents.

Analysis of Subsidy Programs and 
Comments Received 
The subsidy programs under 
investigation, and the issues raised in 
the case and rebuttal briefs by parties in 
this investigation, are discussed in the 
Issues and Decision Memorandum. For 
a list of the issues raised by parties, and 
addressed in the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum, see Appendix II. Methodology 
Commerce conducted this 
investigation in accordance with section 
701 of the Act. For each of the subsidy 
programs found to be countervailable, 
Commerce determines that there is a 
subsidy, i.e., a financial contribution by an ‘‘authority’’ that gives rise to a 
benefit to the recipient, and that the 
subsidy is specific.
9
For a full 
description of the methodology 
underlying our final determination, see 
the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
In making this final determination, 
Commerce relied, in part, on facts 
available, pursuant to section 776(a) of 
the Act.
10
For a full discussion of our 
application of facts available, see the ‘‘Use of Facts Otherwise Available’’ 
section in the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum. 
Changes Since the Preliminary 
Determination 
Based on our findings at verification 
and our review and analysis of the 
comments received from parties, for this 
final determination, we made certain 
changes to the countervailable subsidy 
rate calculations for Suheung Vietnam 
and for all other producers/exporters 
from the Preliminary Determination. For 
a discussion of these changes, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
All-Others Rate 
In accordance with section 
705(c)(1)(B)(i) of the Act, we calculated 
an individual estimated countervailable 
subsidy rate for the mandatory 
respondent, Suheung Vietnam. Section 
705(c)(5)(A)(i) of the Act states that, for 
companies not individually 
investigated, Commerce will determine 
an all-others rate equal to the weighted- 
average countervailable subsidy rates 
established for exporters and/or 
producers individually investigated, 
excluding any zero and de minimis 
countervailable subsidy rates, and any 
rates determined entirely under section 
776 of the Act. For this final 
determination, Suheung Vietnam’s 
subsidy rate is not zero, de minimis, or 
determined entirely under section 776 
of the Act. Consequently, we have 
assigned the subsidy rate calculated for 
Suheung Vietnam as the rate for all 
other producers and/or exporters. 
Final Determination 
Commerce determines that the 
following estimated countervailable 
subsidy rates exist for the period 
January 1, 2023, through December 31, 
2023:

interested parties in this final 
determination within five days of any 
public announcement, or if there is no 
public announcement, within five days 
of the date of the publication of this 
notice in the Federal Register, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.224(b).

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60622 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices Continuation of Suspension of 
Liquidation 
As a result of our Preliminary 
Determination, and pursuant to sections 703(d)(1)(B) and (d)(2) of the Act, we 
instructed U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) to collect cash deposits 
and suspend liquidation of entries of 
subject merchandise from Vietnam that 
were entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption on or after 
March 31, 2025, the date of publication 
of the Preliminary Determination in the 
Federal Register. In accordance with 
section 703(d) of the Act, on July 30, 
2025, we instructed CBP to discontinue 
the suspension of liquidation of all 
entries of subject merchandise entered 
or withdrawn from warehouse on or 
after July 29, 2025, but to continue the 
suspension of liquidation of all entries 
of subject merchandise on or before July 
28, 2025. 
If the U.S. International Trade 
Commission (ITC) issues a final 
affirmative injury determination, we 
will issue a CVD order, reinstate the 
suspension of liquidation under section 
706(a) of the Act, and require a cash 
deposit of estimated countervailing 
duties for such entries of subject 
merchandise in the amounts indicated 
above. Pursuant to section 705(c)(2) of 
the Act, if the ITC determines that 
material injury, or threat of material 
injury, does not exist, this proceeding 
will be terminated, and all estimated 
duties deposited or securities posted as 
a result of the suspension of liquidation 
will be refunded or canceled. 
ITC Notification 
In accordance with section 705(d) of 
the Act, Commerce will notify the ITC 
of its final affirmative determination 
that countervailable subsidies are being 
provided to producers and exporters of 
capsules from Vietnam. As Commerce’s 
final determination is affirmative, in 
accordance with section 705(b) of the 
Act, the ITC will determine, within 45 
days, whether the domestic industry in 
the United States is materially injured, 
or threatened with material injury, by 
reason of imports of capsules from 
Vietnam. In addition, we are making 
available to the ITC all non-privileged 
and non-proprietary information related 
to this investigation. We will allow the 
ITC access to all privileged and business 
proprietary information in our files, 
provided the ITC confirms that it will 
not disclose such information, either 
publicly or under an administrative 
protective order (APO), without the 
written consent of the Assistant 
Secretary for Enforcement and 
Compliance. 
If the ITC determines that material 
injury does not exist, this proceeding 
will be terminated and all cash deposits 
will be refunded. If the ITC determines 
that such injury does exist, Commerce 
will issue a CVD order directing CBP to 
assess, upon further instruction by 
Commerce, countervailing duties on all 
imports of the subject merchandise that 
are entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption on or after 
the effective date of the suspension of 
liquidation, as discussed above in the 
‘‘Continuation of Suspension of 
Liquidation’’ section. 
Administrative Protective Order 
In the event that the ITC issues a final 
negative injury determination, this 
notice will serve as the only reminder 
to parties subject to an APO of their 
responsibility concerning the 
destruction of proprietary information 
disclosed under APO, in accordance 
with 19 CFR 351.305(a)(3). Timely 
written notification of the return/ 
destruction of APO materials or 
conversion to judicial protective order is 
hereby requested. Failure to comply 
with the regulations and terms of an 
APO is a violation which is subject to 
sanction. 
Notification to Interested Parties 
This determination is issued and 
published pursuant to sections 705(d) 
and 777(i) of the Act, and 19 CFR

being, or are likely to be, sold in the 
United States at less than fair value 
(LTFV) for the period of investigation 
April 1, 2024, through September 30, 
2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On May 29, 2025, Commerce 
published in the Federal Register its 
preliminary affirmative determination 
in the LTFV investigation of capsules 
from China, in which it also postponed 
the final determination until October 14, 
2025.
1
On August 27, 2025, Commerce 
issued a post-preliminary analysis 
memorandum in which it made certain 
changes to its differential pricing 
analysis.
2
We invited interested parties 
to comment on the Preliminary 
Determination and changes to the differential pricing analysis.
3
 
Due to the lapse in appropriations and 
Federal Government shutdown, on 
November 14, 2025, Commerce tolled 
all deadlines in administrative 
proceedings by 47 days.
4
Additionally, 
due to a backlog of documents that were 
electronically filed via Enforcement and 
Compliance’s Antidumping and 
Countervailing Duty Centralized 
Electronic Service System (ACCESS) 
during the Federal Government 
shutdown, on November 24, 2025, 
Commerce tolled all deadlines in 
administrative proceedings by an 
additional 21 days.
5
Accordingly, the 
deadline for this final determination is 
now December 18, 2025. 
A summary of the events that 
occurred since the Preliminary 
Determination, as well as a full discussion of the issues raised by parties 
for this final determination, may be 
found in the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum.
6
The Issues and Decision 
Memorandum is a public document and 
is on file electronically via ACCESS. 
ACCESS is available to registered users 
at https://access.trade.gov. In addition, a complete version of the Issues and 
Decision Memorandum can be accessed 
directly at https://access.trade.gov/ 
public/FRNoticesListLayout.aspx. 
Scope of the Investigation 
The products covered by this 
investigation are capsules from China. 
For a complete description of the scope 
of this investigation, see Appendix I. Scope Comments 
In the Preliminary Scope 
Memorandum, we set aside a period of 
time for parties to raise issues regarding 
product coverage (i.e., scope) in scope- specific case briefs or other written 
comments.
7
We received scope case and 
rebuttal briefs from multiple interested 
parties. For a summary of the product 
coverage comments and rebuttal 
response submitted to the record for this 
final determination, and accompanying 
discussion and analysis of all comments 
timely received, see the Final Scope Memorandum.
8
In the Final Scope 
Memorandum, Commerce determined 
that it is modifying the scope language 
as it appeared in the Initiation 
Notice.
9
See Appendix I. Verification 
Commerce conducted verification of 
the information relied upon in making 
its final determination in this 
investigation, in accordance with 
section 782(i) of the Tariff Act of 1930, 
as amended (the Act). Specifically, we 
conducted on-site verifications of the 
sales and cost information submitted by 
Shandong Healsee Capsule Ltd. 
(Shandong Healsee) and Shanxi JC 
Biological Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanxi 
JC) for use in our final determination. 
We used standard verification 
procedures, including an examination of 
relevant sales and accounting records, 
and original source documents provided 
by Shandong Healsee and Shanxi JC. 
Analysis of Comments Received 
All issues raised in the case and 
rebuttal briefs submitted by interested 
parties in this investigation are 
addressed in the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum. A list of the issues 
addressed in the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum is attached to this notice 
as Appendix II. 
Changes Since the Preliminary 
Determination 
We made certain changes to the 
margin calculations for Shandong 
Healsee and Shanxi JC since the 
Preliminary Determination and Post- 
Preliminary Analysis. For a discussion 
of these changes, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
Separate Rate Companies and the 
China-Wide Entity

See Enforcement and Compliance’s Policy Bulletin No. 05.1, regarding, ‘‘Separate-Rates 
Practice and Application of Combination Rates in 
Antidumping Investigations involving Non-Market

Bulletin 05.1), available on Commerce’s website at 
http://enforcement.trade.gov/policy/bull05-1.pdf. 
13
To determine the cash deposit rate, Commerce 
normally adjusts the estimated weighted-average 
dumping margin by the amount of export subsidies 
countervailed in a companion countervailing duty 
(CVD) proceeding, when CVD provisional measures 
are in effect. Accordingly, where Commerce has 
made a final affirmative determination for 
countervailable export subsidies, Commerce offsets 
the estimated weighted-average dumping margin by 
the appropriate CVD rate. However, in the final 
determination of the companion CVD investigation 
of capsules from China, we found no export 
subsidies. See the unpublished Federal Register notice entitled ‘‘Hard Empty Capsules from the 
People’s Republic of China: Final Affirmative 
Countervailing Duty Determination,’’ signed and 
dated concurrently with this Federal Register 
notice. Therefore, Commerce has not adjusted the 
cash deposit rate for export subsidies in the 
companion CVD investigation. 
14
Hubei Kornnac Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Hubei 
Kornnac) initially filed a separate rate application 
under the name ‘‘Hubei Humanwell Pharmaceutical 
Excipients Co., Ltd.’’ and subsequently notified 
Commerce that the company’s name changed to 
Hubei Kornnac. We preliminarily determined it was 
appropriate to allow the name change. See Preliminary Determination, 90 FR at 22705 n.13. No 
party commented on this determination; thus, we 
continue to find it is appropriate to allow the name 
change and grant Hubei Kornnac a separate rate. 
15
In the Preliminary Determination, we listed the 
name of this company as ‘‘Shanxi Guangsheng 
Medicinal Capsule Co., Ltd. A.K.A. Shanxi 
Guangsheng Capsule Co., Ltd.’’ See Preliminary 
Determination, 90 FR at 22706. However, for customs purposes, the appropriate marker between 
a company’s name and an ‘‘also known as’’ name 
is a semicolon; thus, we are correcting the format 
of the company’s names for our final determination. 
not select for individual examination.
10
 
Additionally, because we preliminarily 
did not find that the China-wide entity 
failed to cooperate in this investigation, 
we preliminarily assigned this same rate 
as the estimate weighted-average 
dumping margin for the China-wide 
entity.
11
No party commented on our 
preliminary separate rate 
determinations or our findings with 
respect to the China-wide entity. 
Therefore, we continue to find that 
Shandong Healsee, Shanxi JC, and 
certain non-individually examined 
companies that are listed in the ‘‘Final 
Determination’’ rate table below, are 
eligible for a separate rate. We also 
continue to assign the same rate 
assigned to the non-individually 
examined companies to the China-wide 
entity. 
Combination Rates 
Consistent with the Preliminary 
Determination and Policy Bulletin 05.1,
12
Commerce calculated 
combination rates for the companies 
eligible for a separate rate. 
Final Determination 
Commerce determines that the 
following estimated weighted-average 
dumping margins exist:

Commerce intends to disclose the 
calculations performed in connection 
with this final determination to 
interested parties within five days of 
any public announcement or, if there is 
no public announcement, within five 
days of the date of publication of this 
notice in the Federal Register, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.224(b). 
Suspension of Liquidation 
In accordance with section 733(d)(2) 
of the Act, we instructed U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection (CBP) to suspend 
liquidation of subject merchandise 
entries, as described in Appendix I of 
this notice, that were entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse, for 
consumption on or after May 29, 2025, 
the date of publication of the 
Preliminary Determination in the 
Federal Register. In accordance with 
section 733(d) of the Act, we 
subsequently instructed CBP to 
discontinue the suspension of

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60625 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices liquidation of all entries of subject 
merchandise entered or withdrawn from 
warehouse, on or after November 25, 
2025, but to continue the suspension of 
liquidation of all entries of subject 
merchandise on or before November 24, 
2025. 
Because the estimated weighted- 
average dumping margin is zero for the 
Shanxi JC producer/exporter 
combination, we will discontinue the 
suspension of liquidation and refund all 
cash deposits already collected for this 
producer/exporter combination, 
pursuant to section 735(c)(2) of the Act, 
and we will exclude merchandise 
exported and produced by Shanxi JC 
from the antidumping duty order, in the 
event an order is instituted, in 
accordance with section 735(a)(4) of the 
Act and 19 CFR 351.204(e)(1). However, 
entries of shipments of subject 
merchandise from Shanxi JC in any 
other exporter/producer combination, or 
by third parties that sourced subject 
merchandise from the excluded 
producer/exporter combination, will be 
subject to suspension of liquidation at 
the China-wide entity rate. 
Other than for entries produced and 
exported by Shanxi JC, if the U.S. 
International Trade Commission (ITC) 
issues a final affirmative injury 
determination, we will issue an 
antidumping duty order, reinstate the 
suspension of liquidation, and require a 
cash deposit for estimated weighted- 
average antidumping duties, in 
accordance with section 736(a) of the 
Act, as follows: (1) the cash deposit rate 
for the exporter/producer combinations 
listed in the table above will be the rate 
identified in the table; (2) for all 
combinations of Chinese exporters/ 
producers of subject merchandise that 
have not received their own separate 
rate above, the cash deposit rate will be 
the cash deposit rate established for the 
China-wide entity; and (3) for all non- 
Chinese exporters of subject 
merchandise that have not received 
their own separate rate above, the cash 
deposit rate will be the cash deposit rate 
applicable to the Chinese exporter/ 
producer combination that supplied that 
non-Chinese exporter. 
If the ITC determines that material 
injury, or threat of material injury, does 
not exist, this proceeding will be 
terminated, and all estimated duties 
deposited or securities posted as a result 
of the suspension of liquidation will be 
refunded or canceled. 
ITC Notification 
In accordance with section 735(d) of 
the Act, Commerce will notify the ITC 
of its final affirmative determination of 
sales at LTFV. Because Commerce’s 
final determination is affirmative, in 
accordance with section 735(b)(2) of the 
Act, the ITC will make its final 
determination as to whether the 
domestic industry in the United States 
is materially injured, or threatened with 
material injury, by reason of imports, or 
sales (or the likelihood of sales) for 
importation, of capsules no later than 45 
days after this final determination. If the 
ITC determines that material injury or 
threat of material injury does not exist, 
this proceeding will be terminated, all 
cash deposits will be refunded or 
canceled, and suspension of liquidation 
will be lifted. If the ITC determines that 
such injury does exist, Commerce will 
issue an antidumping duty order 
directing CBP to assess, upon further 
instructions by Commerce, antidumping 
duties on all imports of the subject 
merchandise that are entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse, for 
consumption on or after the effective 
date of the suspension of liquidation, as 
discussed above in the ‘‘Suspension of 
Liquidation’’ section above.

Appendix I 
Scope of the Investigation 
The merchandise subject to the scope of 
the investigation is hard empty capsules, 
which are comprised of two prefabricated, 
hollowed cylindrical sections (cap and body). 
The cap and body pieces each have one 
closed and rounded end and one open end, 
and are constructed with different or equal 
diameters at their open ends. 
Hard empty capsules are unfilled 
cylindrical shells composed of at least 80 
percent by weight of a water soluble polymer 
that is considered non-toxic and appropriate 
for human or animal consumption by the 
United States Pharmacopeia—National 
Formulary (USP–NF), Food Chemical Codex 
(FCC), or equivalent standards. The most 
common polymer materials in hard empty 
capsules are gelatin derived from animal 
collagen (including, but not limited to, pig, 
cow, or fish collagen), hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose (HPMC), and pullulan. 
Hard empty capsules may also contain 
water and additives, such as opacifiers, 
colorants, processing aids, controlled release 
agents, plasticizers, and preservatives. Hard 
empty capsules may also be imprinted or 
otherwise decorated with markings. 
Hard empty capsules are covered by the 
scope of the investigation regardless of 
polymer material, additives, transparency, 
opacity, color, imprinting, or other markings. 
Hard empty capsules are also covered by 
the scope of the investigation regardless of 
their size, weight, length, diameter, 
thickness, and filling capacity. 
Cap and body pieces of hard empty 
capsules are covered by the scope of the 
investigation regardless of whether they are 
imported together or separately, and 
regardless of whether they are imported in 
attached or detached form. 
Hard empty capsules covered by the scope 
of the investigation are those that disintegrate 
in water, simulated intestinal fluid, 
simulated gastric fluid, or other similar 
water-based (i.e., aqueous) fluids within 2 hours under tests specified in Chapter 701 of 
the USP–NF, or equivalent disintegration 
tests. 
Hard empty capsules are classifiable under 
subheadings 9602.00.1040 and 9602.00.5010 
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States (HTSUS). In addition, hard 
empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 1905.90.9090; gelatin 
hard empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 3503.00.5510; HPMC 
hard empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 3923.90.0080; and 
pullulan hard empty capsules may be 
imported under HTSUS subheading 
2106.90.9998. Although the HTSUS 
subheadings are provided for convenience 
and customs purposes, the written 
description of the merchandise covered by 
the investigation is dispositive.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that 
hard empty capsules (capsules) from the 
Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) 
are being, or are likely to be, sold in the 
United States at less than fair value 
(LTFV) for the period of investigation 
April 1, 2024, through September 30, 
2024. 
DATES: Applicable December 29, 2025. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On May 29, 2025, Commerce 
published in the Federal Register its 
preliminary affirmative determination 
in the LTFV investigation of capsules 
from Vietnam, in which it also 
postponed the final determination until 
October 14, 2025.
1
On July 23, 2025, 
Commerce issued a post-preliminary 
analysis memorandum in which it made 
certain changes to its differential pricing 
analysis.
2
We invited interested parties 
to comment on the Preliminary 
Determination and changes to the differential pricing analysis.
3
 
Due to the lapse in appropriations and 
Federal Government shutdown, on 
November 14, 2025, Commerce tolled 
all deadlines in administrative 
proceedings by 47 days.
4
Additionally, 
due to a backlog of documents that were 
electronically filed via Enforcement and 
Compliance’s Antidumping and 
Countervailing Duty Centralized 
Electronic Service System (ACCESS) 
during the Federal Government 
shutdown, on November 24, 2025, 
Commerce tolled all deadlines in 
administrative proceedings by an 
additional 21 days.
5
Accordingly, the 
deadline for this final determination is 
now December 18, 2025. 
A summary of the events that 
occurred since the Preliminary 
Determination, as well as a full discussion of the issues raised by parties 
for this final determination, may be 
found in the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum.

the scope of this investigation, see 
Appendix I. 
Scope Comments 
In the Preliminary Scope 
Memorandum, we set aside a period of 
time for parties to raise issues regarding 
product coverage (i.e., scope) in scope- specific case briefs or other written 
comments.
7
We received scope case and 
rebuttal briefs from multiple interested 
parties. For a summary of the product 
coverage comments and rebuttal 
response submitted to the record for this 
final determination, and accompanying 
discussion and analysis of all comments 
timely received, see the Final Scope Memorandum.
8
In the Final Scope 
Memorandum, Commerce determined 
that it is modifying the scope language 
as it appeared in the Initiation 
Notice.
9
See Appendix I. Verification 
Commerce conducted verification of 
the information relied upon in making 
its final determination in this 
investigation, in accordance with 
section 782(i) of the Tariff Act of 1930, 
as amended (the Act). Specifically, we 
conducted on-site verifications of sales 
and cost information submitted by 
Suheung Vietnam Co., Ltd. (SHVN) for 
use in our final determination. We used 
standard verification procedures, 
including an examination of relevant 
sales and accounting records, and 
original source documents provided by

dumping rate for SHVN. For further 
discussion, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
Separate Rate Company and the 
Vietnam-Wide Entity 
We preliminarily granted a separate 
rate to SHVN, the sole company that 
submitted a separate rate application in 
this investigation.
10
We received no 
comments from interested parties on 
Commerce’s preliminary separate rate 
determination for SHVN. Accordingly, 
we continue to find that SHVN is 
eligible for a separate rate. Additionally, 
because we preliminarily did not find 
that the Vietnam-wide entity failed to 
cooperate in this investigation, we 
preliminarily assigned the estimated 
weighted-average dumping margins 
calculated for SHVN as the estimated 
weighted-average dumping margin for 
the Vietnam-wide entity. No party 
commented on our preliminary separate 
rate determination or our finding with 
respect to the Vietnam-wide entity. 
Therefore, we continue to find that 
SHVN is eligible for a separate rate. We 
also continue to assign the estimated 
weighted-average dumping margins 
calculated for SHVN to the Vietnam- 
wide entity. 
Combination Rates 
Consistent with the Preliminary 
Determination and Policy Bulletin 05.1,

Commerce calculated 
combination rates for the company 
eligible for a separate rate.

Commerce determines that the

dumping margin

Cash deposit rate 
(adjusted for export 
subsidy offset)

Suheung Vietnam Co., Ltd ................................ Suheung Vietnam Co., Ltd ................................47.12 46.24 Vietnam-Wide Entity .......................................................................................................................... 47.12 46.24 Disclosure 
Commerce intends to disclose the 
calculations performed in connection 
with this final determination to 
interested parties within five days after 
public announcement or, if there is no 
public announcement, within five days 
of the date of publication of this notice 
in the Federal Register, in accordance 
with 19 CFR 351.224(b). 
Suspension of Liquidation 
In accordance with section 733(d)(2) 
of the Act, we instructed U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection (CBP) to suspend 
liquidation of all entries of subject 
merchandise, as described in Appendix 
I of this notice, which are entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse, for 
consumption on or after May 29, 2025, 
the date of publication of the 
Preliminary Determination in the 
Federal Register. In accordance with 
section 733(d) of the Act, we instructed 
CBP to discontinue the suspension of 
liquidation of all entries of subject 
merchandise entered or withdrawn from 
warehouse, on or after November 25, 
2025, but to continue the suspension of 
liquidation of all entries of subject 
merchandise on or before November 24, 
2025. 
If the U.S. International Trade 
Commission (ITC) issues a final 
affirmative injury determination, we 
will issue an antidumping duty order, 
reinstate the suspension of liquidation 
under section 736(a) of the Act, and 
require a cash deposit of estimated 
antidumping duties for such entries of 
subject merchandise in the amounts 
indicated above, in accordance with 
section 736(a) of the Act, as follows: (1) 
the cash deposit rate for the exporter/ 
producer combinations listed in the 
table above will be the rate identified in 
the table; (2) for all combinations of 
Vietnamese exporters/producers of 
subject merchandise that have not 
received their own separate rate above, 
the cash deposit rate will be the cash 
deposit rate established for the Vietnam- 
wide entity; and (3) for all non- 
Vietnamese exporters of subject 
merchandise that have not received 
their own separate rate above, the cash 
deposit rate will be the cash deposit rate 
applicable to the Vietnamese exporter/ 
producer combination that supplied that 
non-Vietnamese exporter. 
If the ITC determines that material 
injury, or threat of material injury, does 
not exist, this proceeding will be 
terminated, and all estimated duties 
deposited or securities posted as a result 
of the suspension of liquidation will be 
refunded or canceled. 
To determine the cash deposit rate, 
Commerce normally adjusts the 
estimated weighted-average dumping 
margin by the amount of export 
subsidies countervailed in a companion 
countervailing duty (CVD) investigation, 
when CVD provisional measures are in 
effect. Accordingly, where Commerce 
made an affirmative determination for 
countervailable export subsidies, 
Commerce would offset the estimated 
weighted-average dumping margins by 
the appropriate export subsidy rate.
13
 
Any such adjusted cash deposit rates 
may be found in the ‘‘Final 
Determination’’ section above. If the 
U.S. International Trade Commission 
(ITC) makes a final affirmative 
determination of injury due to both 
dumping and subsidies, then the cash 
deposit rate will include the offsets for 
the export subsidies collected as part of 
the CVD final determination. 
ITC Notification 
In accordance with section 735(d) of 
the Act, Commerce will notify the ITC 
of its final affirmative determination of 
sales at LTFV. Because Commerce’s 
final determination is affirmative, in 
accordance with section 735(b)(2) of the 
Act, the ITC will make its final 
determination as to whether the 
domestic industry in the United States 
is materially injured, or threatened with 
material injury, by reason of imports, or 
sales (or the likelihood of sales) for 
importation, of capsules no later than 45 
days after this final determination. If the 
ITC determines that material injury or 
threat of material injury does not exist, 
this proceeding will be terminated, all 
cash deposits will be refunded or

Appendix I 
Scope of the Investigation 
The merchandise subject to the scope of 
this investigation is hard empty capsules, 
which are comprised of two prefabricated, 
hollowed cylindrical sections (cap and body). 
The cap and body pieces each have one 
closed and rounded end and one open end, 
and are constructed with different or equal 
diameters at their open ends. 
Hard empty capsules are unfilled 
cylindrical shells composed of at least 80 
percent by weight of a water soluble polymer 
that is considered non-toxic and appropriate 
for human or animal consumption by the 
United States Pharmacopeia—National 
Formulary (USP–NF), Food Chemical Codex 
(FCC), or equivalent standards. The most 
common polymer materials in hard empty 
capsules are gelatin derived from animal 
collagen (including, but not limited to, pig, 
cow, or fish collagen), hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose (HPMC), and pullulan. 
Hard empty capsules may also contain 
water and additives, such as opacifiers, 
colorants, processing aids, controlled release 
agents, plasticizers, and preservatives. Hard 
empty capsules may also be imprinted or 
otherwise decorated with markings. 
Hard empty capsules are covered by the 
scope of this investigation regardless of 
polymer material, additives, transparency, 
opacity, color, imprinting, or other markings. 
Hard empty capsules are also covered by 
the scope of this investigation regardless of 
their size, weight, length, diameter, 
thickness, and filling capacity. 
Cap and body pieces of hard empty 
capsules are covered by the scope of this 
investigation regardless of whether they are 
imported together or separately, and 
regardless of whether they are imported in 
attached or detached form. 
Hard empty capsules covered by the scope 
of this investigation are those that 
disintegrate in water, simulated intestinal 
fluid, simulated gastric fluid, or other similar 
water-based (i.e., aqueous) fluids within 2 hours under tests specified in Chapter 701 of 
the USP–NF, or equivalent disintegration 
tests. 
Hard empty capsules are classifiable under 
subheadings 9602.00.1040 and 9602.00.5010 
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States (HTSUS). In addition, hard 
empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 1905.90.9090; gelatin 
hard empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 3503.00.5510; HPMC 
hard empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 3923.90.0080; and 
pullulan hard empty capsules may be 
imported under HTSUS subheading 
2106.90.9998. Although the HTSUS 
subheadings are provided for convenience 
and customs purposes, the written 
description of the merchandise covered by 
this investigation is dispositive.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that 
countervailable subsidies are being 
provided to producers and exporters of 
hard empty capsules (capsules) from the 
People’s Republic of China (China). The 
period of investigation is January 1, 
2023, through December 31, 2023. 
DATES: Applicable December 29, 2025. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On March 31, 2025, Commerce 
published the Preliminary 
Determination in the Federal Register, invited interested parties to comment.
1
 
In the Preliminary Determination, and 
in accordance with section 705(a)(1) of 
the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the 
Act), and 19 CFR 351.210(b)(4), 
Commerce aligned the final CVD 
determination with the final 
determination in the less-than-fair-value 
investigation of capsules from China.

Due to the lapse in appropriations and 
Federal Government shutdown, on 
November 14, 2025, Commerce tolled 
all deadlines in administrative 
proceedings by 47 days.

Additionally, 
due to a backlog of documents that were 
electronically filed via Enforcement and 
Compliance’s Antidumping and 
Countervailing Duty Centralized 
Electronic Service System (ACCESS)

With two respondents under examination, 
Commerce normally calculates: (A) a weighted- 
average of the estimated subsidy rates calculated for 
the examined respondents; (B) a simple average of 
the estimated subsidy rates calculated for the 
examined respondents; and (C) a weighted-average 
of the estimated subsidy rates calculated for the 
examined respondents using each company’s 
publicly-ranged U.S. sale values for the 
merchandise under consideration. Commerce then 
compares (B) and (C) to (A) and selects the rate 
closest to (A) as the most appropriate rate for all 
other producers and exporters. See, e.g., Ball 
Bearings and Parts Thereof from France, Germany, 
Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom: Final Results 
of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews, Final 
Results of Changed-Circumstances Review, and 
Revocation of an Order in Part, 75 FR 53661, 53662 
(September 1, 2010), and accompanying Issues and 
Decision Memorandum at Comment 1. As complete 
publicly ranged sales data were available, 
Commerce based the all-others rate on the publicly 
ranged sales data of the mandatory respondents. For 
a complete analysis of the data, see Memorandum, ‘‘Calculation of Subsidy Rate for All Others,’’ dated 
concurrently with this notice. 
Commerce tolled all deadlines in 
administrative proceedings by an 
additional 21 days.
4
Accordingly, the 
deadline for this final determination is 
now December 18, 2025. 
For a complete discussion of the 
events that followed the Preliminary 
Determination, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum.

The Issues and 
Decision Memorandum is a public 
document and is made available to the 
public via ACCESS. ACCESS is 
available to registered users at https://
access.trade.gov. In addition, a complete version of the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum can be accessed directly 
at https://access.trade.gov/public/ FRNoticesListLayout.aspx. 
Scope of the Investigation 
The products covered by this 
investigation are capsules from China. 
For a complete description of the scope 
of this investigation, see Appendix I. Scope Comments 
In the Preliminary Scope 
Memorandum, we set aside a period of 
time for parties to raise issues regarding 
product coverage (i.e., scope) in scope- specific case briefs or other written 
comments.
6
We received scope case and 
rebuttal briefs from multiple interested 
parties. For a summary of the product 
coverage comments and rebuttal 
response submitted to the record for this 
final determination, and accompanying 
discussion and analysis of all comments 
timely received, see the Final Scope Memorandum.
7
In the Final Scope 
Memorandum, Commerce determined 
that it is modifying the scope language 
as it appeared in the Initiation 
Notice.
8
See Appendix I. Verification 
As provided in section 782(i) the Act, 
in April 2025, Commerce verified the 
information reported by Jiangsu Lefan 
Capsule Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu Lefan) and 
Shanxi JC Biological Technology Co., 
Ltd. (Shanxi JC) for use in our final 
determination. We used standard 
verification procedures, including an 
examination of relevant accounting 
records and original source documents 
provided at verification.

Analysis of Subsidy Programs and 
Comments Received 
The subsidy programs under 
investigation and the issues raised in 
the case and rebuttal briefs that were 
submitted by interested parties in this 
investigation are discussed in the Issues 
and Decision Memorandum. For a list of 
the issues raised by interested parties 
and addressed in the Issues and 
Decision Memorandum, see Appendix II to this notice. 
Methodology 
Commerce conducted this 
investigation in accordance with section 
701 of the Act. For each of the subsidy 
programs found to be countervailable, 
Commerce determines that there is a 
subsidy, i.e., a financial contribution by an ‘‘authority’’ that gives rise to a 
benefit to the recipient, and that the 
subsidy is specific.
10
For a full 
description of the methodology 
underlying our final determination, see 
the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
In making this final determination, 
Commerce relied, in part, on facts 
otherwise available, including with an 
adverse inference, pursuant to sections 
776(a) and (b) of the Act. For a full 
discussion of our application of adverse 
facts available (AFA), see the Preliminary Determination
11
and the 
Issues and Decision Memorandum at the 
section entitled ‘‘Use of Facts Available 
and Application of Adverse Inferences.’’ 
Changes Since the Preliminary 
Determination 
Based on our review and analysis of 
the information received during 
verification and comments received 
from parties, for this final 
determination, we made certain changes 
to the countervailable subsidy rate 
calculations for Jiangsu Lefan, Shanxi 
JC, and for all other producers/ 
exporters.
12
For a discussion of these 
changes, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
All-Others Rate 
Section 705(c)(5)(A)(i) of the Act 
states that, for companies not 
individually investigated, Commerce 
will determine an all-others rate equal 
to the weighted-average countervailable 
subsidy rates established for exporters 
and/or producers individually 
investigated, excluding any zero and de 
minimis countervailable subsidy rates, and any rates determined entirely under 
section 776 of the Act. 
Commerce calculated individual 
estimated countervailable subsidy rates 
for Jiangsu Lefan and Shanxi JC that are 
not zero, de minimis, or based entirely 
on facts otherwise available. Commerce 
calculated the all-others rate using a 
weighted average of the individual 
estimated subsidy rates calculated for 
the examined respondents using each 
company’s publicly-ranged values for 
the merchandise under consideration.
13
 
Final Determination 
Commerce determines that the 
following estimated countervailable 
subsidy rates exist for the period 
January 1, 2023, through December 31, 
2023:

Disclosure 
Commerce intends to disclose its 
calculations performed to interested 
parties in this final determination 
within five days of its public 
announcement or, if there is no public 
announcement, within five days of the 
date of the publication of this notice in 
the Federal Register, in accordance with 19 CFR 351.224(b). 
Suspension of Liquidation 
As a result of our Preliminary 
Determination, and pursuant to sections 703(d)(1)(B) and (d)(2) of the Act, we 
instructed U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) to collect cash deposits 
and suspend liquidation of entries of 
subject merchandise from China that 
were entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption, on or after 
March 31, 2025, the date of the 
publication of the Preliminary 
Determination in the Federal Register.14
 
In accordance with section 703(d) of the 
Act, we instructed CBP to discontinue 
the suspension of liquidation of all 
entries of subject merchandise entered 
or withdrawn from warehouse, on or 
after July 29, 2025 but to continue the 
suspension of liquidation of all entries 
of subject merchandise on or before July 
28, 2025. 
If the U.S. International Trade 
Commission (ITC) issues a final 
affirmative injury determination, we 
will issue a countervailing duty (CVD) 
order, reinstate the suspension of 
liquidation under section 706(a) of the 
Act, and require a cash deposit of 
estimated countervailing duties for 
entries of subject merchandise in the 
amounts indicated above. Pursuant to 
section 705(c)(2) of the Act, if the ITC 
determines that material injury, or 
threat of material injury, does not exist, 
this proceeding will be terminated, and 
all estimated duties deposited or 
securities posted as a result of the 
suspension of liquidation will be 
refunded or cancelled. 
U.S. International Trade Commission 
Notification 
In accordance with section 705(d) of 
the Act, Commerce will notify the ITC 
of its final affirmative determination 
that countervailable subsidies are being 
provided to producers and exporters of 
capsules from China. As Commerce’s 
final determination is affirmative, in 
accordance with section 705(b) of the 
Act, the ITC will determine, within 45 
days, whether the domestic industry in 
the United States is materially injured, 
or threatened with material injury, by 
reason of import of capsules from China. 
In addition, we are making available to 
the ITC all non-privileged and non- 
proprietary information in our files, 
provided the ITC confirms that it will 
not disclose such information, either 
publicly or under administrative 
protective order (APO), without the 
written consent of the Assistant 
Secretary for Enforcement and 
Compliance. If the ITC determines that 
material injury or threat of material 
injury does not exist, this proceeding 
will be terminated, and all cash deposits 
will be refunded. If the ITC determines 
that such injury does exist, Commerce 
will issue a CVD order directing CBP to 
assess, upon further instruction by 
Commerce, countervailing duties on all 
imports of the subject merchandise that 
are entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption on or after 
the effective date of the suspension of 
liquidation, as discussed above in the 
‘‘Suspension of Liquidation’’ section. 
Administrative Protective Order 
This notice will serve as the final 
reminder to parties subject to an APO of 
their responsibility concerning the 
destruction of proprietary information 
disclosed under APO, in accordance 
with 19 CFR 351.305(a)(3). Timely 
written notification of the return or 
destruction of APO materials or 
conversion to judicial protective order is 
hereby requested. Failure to comply 
with the regulations and terms of an 
APO is a violation which is subject to 
sanction. 
Notification to Interested Parties 
This determination is issued and 
published in accordance with sections 
705(d) and 777(i) of the Act, and 19 CFR 
351.210(c).

this investigation is hard empty capsules, 
which are comprised of two prefabricated, 
hollowed cylindrical sections (cap and body). 
The cap and body pieces each have one 
closed and rounded end and one open end, 
and are constructed with different or equal 
diameters at their open ends. 
Hard empty capsules are unfilled 
cylindrical shells composed of at least 80 
percent by weight of a water soluble polymer 
that is considered non-toxic and appropriate 
for human or animal consumption by the 
United States Pharmacopeia—National 
Formulary (USP–NF), Food Chemical Codex 
(FCC), or equivalent standards. The most 
common polymer materials in hard empty 
capsules are gelatin derived from animal 
collagen (including, but not limited to, pig, 
cow, or fish collagen), hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose (HPMC), and pullulan. 
Hard empty capsules may also contain 
water and additives, such as opacifiers, 
colorants, processing aids, controlled release 
agents, plasticizers, and preservatives. Hard 
empty capsules may also be imprinted or 
otherwise decorated with markings. 
Hard empty capsules are covered by the 
scope of this investigation regardless of 
polymer material, additives, transparency, 
opacity, color, imprinting, or other markings. 
Hard empty capsules are also covered by 
the scope of this investigation regardless of 
their size, weight, length, diameter, 
thickness, and filling capacity. 
Cap and body pieces of hard empty 
capsules are covered by the scope of this 
investigation regardless of whether they are 
imported together or separately, and 
regardless of whether they are imported in 
attached or detached form. 
Hard empty capsules covered by the scope 
of this investigation are those that 
disintegrate in water, simulated intestinal 
fluid, simulated gastric fluid, or other similar 
water-based (i.e., aqueous) fluids within 2 hours under tests specified in Chapter 701 of 
the USP–NF, or equivalent disintegration 
tests. 
Hard empty capsules are classifiable under 
subheadings 9602.00.1040 and 9602.00.5010 
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States (HTSUS). In addition, hard 
empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 1905.90.9090; gelatin 
hard empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 3503.00.5510; HPMC 
hard empty capsules may be imported under 
HTSUS subheading 3923.90.0080; and 
pullulan hard empty capsules may be 
imported under HTSUS subheading 
2106.90.9998. Although the HTSUS 
subheadings are provided for convenience 
and customs purposes, the written 
description of the merchandise covered by 
this investigation is dispositive.

Countervailing Duty Determination 
AGENCY: Enforcement and Compliance, International Trade Administration, 
Department of Commerce. 
SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that 
countervailable subsidies are being 
provided to producers and exporters of 
paper file folders from the Kingdom of 
Cambodia (Cambodia). The period of 
investigation (POI) is January 1, 2023, 
through December 31, 2023.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On March 28, 2025, Commerce 
published the Preliminary 
Determination in the Federal Register, invited interested parties to comment on 
the Preliminary Determination, and aligned this countervailing duty 
investigation with the final 
determination in the less-than-fair value 
investigation of paper file folders from 
Cambodia, in accordance with section 
705(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended (the Act), and 19 CFR 
351.210(b)(4).
1
On August 27, 2025, 
Commerce released its Post-Preliminary 
Analysis.
2
 
Due to the lapse in appropriations and 
Federal Government shutdown, on 
November 14, 2025, Commerce tolled 
all deadlines in administrative 
proceedings by 47 days.
3
Additionally, 
due to a backlog of documents that were 
electronically filed via Enforcement and 
Compliance’s Antidumping and 
Countervailing Duty Centralized 
Electronic Service System (ACCESS) 
during the Federal Government 
shutdown, on November 24, 2025, 
Commerce tolled all deadlines in 
administrative proceedings by an 
additional 21 days.
4
Accordingly, the 
deadline for this final determination is 
now December 18, 2025. 
For a complete discussion of the 
events that followed the Preliminary 
Determination, see the Issues and 
Decision Memorandum.
5
The Issues and 
Decision Memorandum is a public 
document and is on file electronically 
via Enforcement and Compliance’s 
Antidumping and Countervailing Duty 
Centralized Electronic Service System 
(ACCESS). ACCESS is available to 
registered users at https://access.
trade.gov. In addition, a complete version of the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum can be accessed directly 
at https://access.trade.gov/public/ FRNoticesListLayout.aspx. 
Scope of the Investigation 
The products covered by this 
investigation are paper file folders. For 
a complete description of the scope of 
this investigation, see Appendix I. Scope Comments 
No interested party commented on the 
scope of the investigation as it appeared 
in the Preliminary Determination. 
Therefore, no changes were made to the 
scope of the investigation. 
Verification 
As provided in section 782(i) of the 
Act, in July 2025, Commerce conducted 
on-site verification of the subsidy 
information reported by the Royal 
Government of Cambodia (RCG) and 
Three Color Stone Stationery 
(Cambodia) Co., Ltd. (TCS). We used 
standard verification procedures, 
including an examination of relevant 
accounting records and original source 
documents provided by the RGC and 
TCS.

Analysis of Subsidy Programs and 
Comments Received 
The subsidy programs under 
investigation and the issues raised in 
the case and rebuttal briefs submitted by 
interested parties in this investigation 
are discussed in the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum. For a list of the issues 
raised by interested parties and 
addressed in the Issues and Decision 
Memorandum, see Appendix II. Methodology 
Commerce conducted this 
investigation in accordance with section 
701 of the Act. For each of the subsidy 
programs found to be countervailable, 
Commerce determines that there is a 
subsidy, i.e., a financial contribution by an ‘‘authority’’ that gives rise to a 
benefit to the recipient, and that the 
subsidy is specific.
7
For a full 
description of the methodology 
underlying our final determination, see 
the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
In making this final determination, 
Commerce relied, in part, on facts 
otherwise available, including with 
adverse inferences, pursuant to sections 
776(a) and (b) of the Act. For a full 
discussion of our application of adverse 
facts available (AFA), see the Issues and Decision Memorandum at the section 
entitled ‘‘Use of Facts Otherwise 
Available and Application of Adverse 
Inferences.’’ 
Changes Since the Preliminary 
Determination 
For this final determination, we have 
included an additional subsidy program 
addressed in the Post-Preliminary

See Post-Preliminary Analysis at 14–15. 9
TCS’s subsidy rate in the Preliminary 
Determination was 21.53 percent ad valorem. The subsidy rate for the additional program addressed 
in the Post-Preliminary Analysis was 8.85 percent 
ad valorem. See Preliminary Determination, 90 FR at 14111; see also Post-Preliminary Analysis at 15. 
The sum of these two rates is 30.38 percent ad valorem. 
Analysis.
8
Based on our review and 
analysis of the information at 
verification and comments received 
from interested parties, we made no 
changes to the subsidy rate calculations 
for TCS and all other producers and/or 
exporters from the Preliminary 
Determination and Post-Preliminary Analysis. For further discussion, see the Issues and Decision Memorandum. 
All-Others Rate 
In accordance with section 
705(c)(1)(B)(i) of the Act, we calculated 
an individual estimated countervailable 
subsidy rate for the mandatory 
respondent, TCS. Section 705(c)(5)(A)(i) 
of the Act states that, for companies not 
individually investigated, Commerce 
will determine an all-others rate equal 
to the weighted-average countervailable 
subsidy rates established for exporters 
and/or producers individually 
investigated, excluding any zero and de 
minimis countervailable subsidy rates, and any rates determined entirely under 
section 776 of the Act. For this final 
determination, TCS’s subsidy rate is not 
zero, de minimis, or determined entirely under section 776 of the Act. 
Consequently, we have assigned the 
subsidy rate calculated for TCS as the 
rate for all other producers and/or 
exporters. 
Final Determination 
Commerce determines that the 
following estimated countervailable 
subsidy rates exist for the period 
January 1, 2023, through December 31, 
2023:

All Others ..............................30.38 Disclosure 
Commerce normally discloses the 
calculations for a final determination to 
interested parties within five days of 
any public announcement or, if there is 
no public announcement, within five 
days of the date of the publication of the 
notice in the Federal Register, in 
accordance with 19 CFR 351.224(b). 
However, because we have made no 
changes to the calculations from the 
Preliminary Determination and Post- 
Preliminary Analysis, there are no new 
calculations to disclose. 
Suspension of Liquidation 
As a result of our Preliminary 
Determination, and pursuant to sections 703(d)(1)(B) and (d)(2) of the Act, 
Commerce instructed U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection (CBP) to collect cash 
deposits and suspend liquidation of 
entries of subject merchandise as 
described in the scope of the 
investigation section entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse, for 
consumption on or after March 28, 
2025, the date of publication of the 
Preliminary Determination in the 
Federal Register. In accordance with 
section 703(d) of the Act, on July 28, 
2025, we instructed CBP to discontinue 
the suspension of liquidation of all 
entries of subject merchandise entered 
or withdrawn from warehouse on or 
after July 26, 2025, but to continue the 
suspension of liquidation of all entries 
of subject merchandise on or after 
March 28, 2025, to on or before July 25, 
2025. 
If the U.S. International Trade 
Commission (ITC) issues a final 
affirmative injury determination, we 
will issue a countervailing duty order, 
reinstate the suspension of liquidation 
under section 706(a) of the Act, and 
require a cash deposit of estimated 
countervailing duties for such entries of 
subject merchandise in the amounts 
indicated above, in accordance with 
section 706(a) of the Act. If the ITC 
determines that material injury, or 
threat of material injury, does not exist, 
this proceeding will be terminated, and 
all estimated duties deposited or 
securities posted as a result of the 
suspension of liquidation will be 
refunded or canceled. 
ITC Notification 
In accordance with section 705(d) of 
the Act, Commerce will notify the ITC 
of its final affirmative determination 
that countervailable subsidies are being 
provided to producers and exporters of 
paper file folders from Cambodia. As 
Commerce’s final determination is 
affirmative, in accordance with section 
705(b) of the Act, the ITC will 
determine, within 45 days, whether the 
domestic industry in the United States 
is materially injured, or threatened with 
material injury, by reason of imports of 
paper file folders from Cambodia. In 
addition, we are making available to the 
ITC all non-privileged and non- 
proprietary information related to this 
investigation. We will allow the ITC 
access to all privileged and business 
proprietary information in our files, 
provided the ITC confirms that it will 
not disclose such information, either 
publicly or under an administrative 
protective order, without the written 
consent of the Assistant Secretary for 
Enforcement and Compliance. If the ITC 
determines that material injury does not 
exist, this proceeding will be terminated 
and all cash deposits will be refunded. 
If the ITC determines that such injury 
does exist, Commerce will issue a 
countervailing duty order directing CBP 
to assess, upon further instruction by 
Commerce, countervailing duties on all 
imports of the subject merchandise that 
are entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption on or after 
the effective date of the suspension of 
liquidation, as discussed above in the 
‘‘Continuation of Suspension of 
Liquidation’’ section. 
Administrative Protective Order (APO) 
In the event that the ITC issues a final 
negative injury determination, this 
notice will serve as the only reminder 
to parties subject to an APO of their 
responsibility concerning the 
destruction of proprietary information 
disclosed under APO, in accordance 
with 19 CFR 351.305(a)(3). Timely 
written notification of the return/ 
destruction of APO materials or 
conversion to judicial protective order is 
hereby requested. Failure to comply 
with the regulations and terms of an 
APO is a violation which is subject to 
sanction. 
Notification to Interested Parties 
This determination is issued and 
published in accordance with sections 
705(d) and 777(i) of the Act, and 19 CFR 
351.210(c). 
Dated: December 18, 2025.

Negotiations, performing the non-exclusive

ACTION: Notice; issuance of letter of authorization. 
SUMMARY: In accordance with the Marine Mammal Protection Act 
(MMPA), as amended, its implementing 
regulations, and NMFS’ MMPA 
regulations for taking marine mammals 
incidental to geophysical surveys 
related to oil and gas activities in the 
Gulf of America, originally published as 
‘‘Taking Marine Mammals Incidental to 
Geophysical Surveys Related to Oil and 
Gas Activities in the Gulf of Mexico,’’ 
notification is hereby given that NMFS 
has issued a revised Letter of 
Authorization (LOA) to WesternGeco 
LLC (WesternGeco), in place of Viridien, 
for the take of marine mammals 
incidental to geophysical survey activity 
in the Gulf of America (GOA). 
DATES: The LOA is effective through April 19, 2026.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
Sections 101(a)(5)(A) and (D) of the 
MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) direct 
the Secretary of Commerce to allow, 
upon request, the incidental, but not 
intentional, taking of small numbers of 
marine mammals by U.S. citizens who 
engage in a specified activity (other than 
commercial fishing) within a specified 
geographical region if certain findings 
are made and either regulations are 
issued or, if the taking is limited to 
harassment, a notice of a proposed 
authorization is provided to the public 
for review. 
An authorization for incidental 
takings shall be granted if NMFS finds 
that the taking will have a negligible 
impact on the species or stock(s), will 
not have an unmitigable adverse impact 
on the availability of the species or 
stock(s) for subsistence uses (where 
relevant), and if the permissible 
methods of taking and requirements 
pertaining to the mitigation, monitoring 
and reporting of such takings are set 
forth. NMFS has defined ‘‘negligible 
impact’’ in 50 CFR 216.103 as an impact 
resulting from the specified activity that 
cannot be reasonably expected to, and is 
not reasonably likely to, adversely affect 
the species or stock through effects on 
annual rates of recruitment or survival. 
Except with respect to certain 
activities not pertinent here, the MMPA 
defines ‘‘harassment’’ as: any act of 
pursuit, torment, or annoyance which (i) 
has the potential to injure a marine 
mammal or marine mammal stock in the 
wild (Level A harassment); or (ii) has 
the potential to disturb a marine 
mammal or marine mammal stock in the 
wild by causing disruption of behavioral 
patterns, including, but not limited to, 
migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, 
feeding, or sheltering (Level B 
harassment). 
On January 19, 2021, we issued a final 
rule with regulations to govern the 
unintentional taking of marine 
mammals incidental to geophysical 
survey activities conducted by oil and 
gas industry operators, and those 
persons authorized to conduct activities 
on their behalf (collectively ‘‘industry 
operators’’), in U.S. waters of the GOA
1
 
over the course of 5 years (86 FR 5322, 
January 19, 2021). The rule was based 
on our findings that the total taking 
from the specified activities over the 5- 
year period will have a negligible 
impact on the affected species or 
stock(s) of marine mammals and will 
not have an unmitigable adverse impact 
on the availability of those species or 
stocks for subsistence uses, and became 
effective on April 19, 2021. 
The regulations at 50 CFR 217.180 et 
seq. allow for the issuance of LOAs to industry operators for the incidental 
take of marine mammals during 
geophysical survey activities and 
prescribe the permissible methods of 
taking and other means of effecting the 
least practicable adverse impact on 
marine mammal species or stocks and 
their habitat (often referred to as 
mitigation), as well as requirements 
pertaining to the monitoring and 
reporting of such taking. Under 50 CFR 
217.186(e), issuance of an LOA shall be 
based on a determination that the level 
of taking will be consistent with the 
findings made for the total taking 
allowable under these regulations and a 
determination that the amount of take 
authorized under the LOA is of no more 
than small numbers. 
NMFS subsequently discovered that 
the 2021 rule was based on erroneous 
take estimates. We conducted another 
rulemaking using correct take estimates 
and other newly available and pertinent 
information relevant to the analyses 
supporting some of the findings in the 
2021 final rule and the taking allowable 
under the regulations. We issued a final 
rule in April 2024, effective May 24, 
2024 (89 FR 31488, April 24, 2024). 
The 2024 final rule made no changes 
to the specified activities or the 
specified geographical region in which 
those activities would be conducted, nor 
to the original 5-year period of 
effectiveness. In consideration of the 
new information, the 2024 rule 
presented new analyses supporting 
affirmance of the negligible impact 
determinations for all species, and 
affirmed that the existing regulations, 
which contain mitigation, monitoring, 
and reporting requirements, are 
consistent with the ‘‘least practicable 
adverse impact’’ standard of the MMPA.

On August 1, 2025, NMFS issued an 
LOA to Viridien (90 FR 37842, August 
6, 2025) to take marine mammals 
incidental to a three-dimensional (3D) 
ocean bottom node (OBN) survey over 
2,023 lease blocks in the Garden Banks, 
Keathley Canyon, East Breaks, and 
Alaminos Canyon areas, with water 
depths ranging from approximately 185 
to 2,095 meters (m). See section F of the 
LOA application for a map of the area. 
Additional description of the planned 
survey, as well as analysis related to the 
issuance of that LOA, is available in 
Viridien’s LOA application and the 
aforementioned Federal Register notice of issuance. 
On December 9, 2025, Viridien 
requested the transfer of the LOA to its 
partner in the planned survey effort 
(WesternGeco). WesternGeco confirmed 
to NMFS that it similarly requested 
transfer of the LOA. With the transfer of 
the LOA, WesternGeco agrees to comply 
with the associated terms, conditions, 
stipulations, and restrictions of the 
original LOA. No other changes were 
requested. The revised LOA remains 
effective through April 19, 2026. 
The revised LOA sets forth only a 
change in the LOA holder. There are no 
other changes to the LOA as described 
in the August 6, 2025, Federal Register 
notice of issuance (90 FR 37842): the 
specified activity; estimated take by 
incidental harassment; and small 
numbers analysis and determination; 
and the period of effectiveness remain 
unchanged and are herein incorporated 
by reference. 
Authorization 
NMFS has determined that the level 
of taking for this LOA request is 
consistent with the findings made for 
the total taking allowable under the 
incidental take regulations and that the 
amount of take authorized under the 
LOA is of no more than small numbers. 
Accordingly, we have issued an LOA to 
WesternGeco authorizing the take of 
marine mammals incidental to its 
geophysical survey activity, as 
described above.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
The MMPA prohibits the ‘‘take’’ of 
marine mammals, with certain 
exceptions. Section 101(a)(5) (D) of the 
MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) directs 
the Secretary of Commerce (as delegated 
to NMFS) to allow, upon request, the 
incidental, but not intentional, taking of 
small numbers of marine mammals by 
U.S. citizens who engage in a specified 
activity (other than commercial fishing) 
within a specified geographical region if 
certain findings are made and either 
regulations are proposed or, if the taking 
is limited to harassment, a notice of a 
proposed IHA is provided to the public 
for review. 
Authorization for incidental takings 
shall be granted if NMFS finds that the 
taking will have a negligible impact on 
the species or stock(s) and will not have 
an unmitigable adverse impact on the 
availability of the species or stock(s) for 
taking for subsistence uses (where 
relevant). Further, NMFS must prescribe 
the permissible methods of taking and 
other ‘‘means of effecting the least 
practicable adverse impact’’ on the 
affected species or stocks and their 
habitat, paying particular attention to 
rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of 
similar significance, and on the 
availability of the species or stocks for 
taking for certain subsistence uses 
(collectively referred to as ‘‘mitigation’’); 
and requirements pertaining to the 
monitoring and reporting of the takings. 
The definitions of all applicable MMPA 
statutory terms used above are included 
in the relevant sections below and can

216–6A, NMFS must review our 
proposed action (i.e., the issuance of an IHA) with respect to potential impacts 
on the human environment. This action 
is consistent with categories of activities 
identified in Categorical Exclusion B4 
(IHAs with no anticipated serious injury 
or mortality) of the Companion Manual 
for NAO 216–6A, which do not 
individually or cumulatively have the 
potential for significant impacts on the 
quality of the human environment and 
for which we have not identified any 
extraordinary circumstances that would 
preclude this categorical exclusion. 
Accordingly, NMFS has preliminarily 
determined that the issuance of the 
proposed IHA qualifies to be 
categorically excluded from further 
NEPA review. 
Summary of Request 
On May 4, 2023, NMFS received an 
application from PG&E requesting the 
take of marine mammals incidental to 
construction of a Sediment Remediation 
Project in Remedial Response Areas A 
and B, Piers 39 to 43
1
2, San Francisco 
Bay. NMFS published a notice of a 
proposed IHA and request for comments 
in the Federal Register on December 27, 
2023 (88 FR 82836). We subsequently 
published the final notice of our 
issuance of the IHA on January 30, 2024 
(89 FR 5865), making the IHA valid 
from May 1, 2024 through April 30, 
2025. Following a request from PG&E, 
NMFS published a notice of proposed 
renewal IHA on October 16, 2024 (89 FR 
83459) and issued the renewal IHA on 
November 22, 2024 (89 FR 92649), 
making the renewal IHA valid from May 
1, 2025 to April 30, 2026. The specified 
activities were expected to result in the 
take of seven species of marine mammal 
including the bottlenose dolphin 
(Tursiops truncates), harbor porpoise 
(Phocoena phocoena), California sea 
lion (Zalophus californianus), northern 
fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus), Steller 
sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus), harbor 
seal (Phoca vitulina), and northern 
elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris). 
On August 11, 2025, NMFS received 
a request from PG&E for an IHA to take 
marine mammals incidental to 
construction in Remedial Response Area 
C, Pier 41
1
2, San Francisco Bay, as a 
part of a continuation of the Sediment 
Remediation Project. Following NMFS’ 
review of the application, PG&E 
submitted a revised version on 
December 18, 2025, which was deemed 
adequate and complete. PG&E’s request 
is for take of eight species (nine stocks) 
by Level B harassment only. Neither 
PG&E nor NMFS expect serious injury 
or mortality to result from this activity 
and, therefore, an IHA is appropriate. 
NMFS previously issued an IHA and 
renewal IHA to PG&E (herein referred to 
as the 2024 IHA and 2025 renewal IHA) 
(89 FR 5865, January 30, 2024; 89 FR 
92649, November 24, 2024) to 
incidentally take marine mammals, by 
Level B harassment, for similar 
construction activities in San Francisco 
Bay, as part of the larger sediment 
remediation project. Although PG&E is 
proposing to install many of the same 
pile types as the 2024 IHA, some pile 
types differ. In addition, some source 
levels and harassment distances have 
been adjusted based on hydroacoustic 
measurements conducted by PG&E. 
PG&E is also requesting take of gray 
whale (Eschrichtius robustus) based on 
recent marine mammal monitoring in 
San Francisco Bay. The proposed 
mitigation, monitoring, and reporting 
measures remain the same as prescribed 
in the 2024 IHA with slight 
modifications (e.g., shut down zones distance changes) as described below. 
PG&E complied with all the 
requirements (e.g., mitigation, monitoring, and reporting) of the 
previous IHA, and information 
regarding their monitoring results may 
be found in the Estimated Take of 
Marine Mammals section. 
This proposed IHA would cover 1 
year of a larger project for which PG&E 
obtained prior IHAs and intends to 
request take authorization for 
subsequent facets of the project. The 
larger 5–7 year project involves 
construction to remediate contaminated 
sediment. 
Description of Proposed Activity 
Overview 
PG&E is proposing to conduct pile 
driving to remediate sediments 
impacted by polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) around the area 
offshore and under Pier 41
1
2in San 
Francisco Bay, CA. PG&E would install 
piles for a turbidity curtain, the 
temporary relocation of the Blue and 
Gold Fleet (BGF), and sediment pins for 
slope stabilization. PG&E plans to use 
primarily vibratory pile driving. Impact 
pile driving would only be used as 
needed to seat piles. Vibratory and 
impact pile driving would introduce 
underwater sounds that may result in 
take, by Level B harassment, of marine 
mammals. Level A harassment of 
marine mammals is not expected, and 
none is proposed for authorization. 
Dates and Duration 
The proposed IHA would be valid for 
the statutory maximum of 1 year from 
the date of effectiveness. It will become 
effective upon written notification from 
the applicant to NMFS, but not 
beginning later than 1 year from the date 
of issuance or extending beyond 2 years 
from the date of issuance. In-water 
construction is anticipated to occur over 
62 construction days between March 
and November. However, project delays 
may occur due to a number of factors, 
including availability of equipment and/ 
or materials, weather-related delays, 
equipment maintenance and/or repair, 
and other contingencies. Pile driving 
will occur during daylight hours. Any 
impact pile driving would occur from 
June 1 to November 30 to protect 
sensitive life stages of Endangered 
Species Act (ESA)-listed fish species in 
the area. 
Specific Geographic Region 
PG&E’s proposed construction 
activities would occur in San Francisco 
Bay, CA, about 3.7 miles (mi) (6 
kilometers [km]) from the entrance. 
PG&E’s sediment remediation project 
area encompasses Pier 39, both the Pier 
39 East and West Basins, defined by 
existing breakwaters, and the intertidal 
and subtidal areas between Pier 39 and 
45 along the margin of San Francisco 
Bay. The project area is divided into five 
remedial response areas. All pile driving 
during the timeframe of this proposed 
IHA would be in Remedial Response 
Area C, which is the Pier 41
1
2offshore 
area and the area under Pier 41
1
2. See 
figure 1.

Detailed Description of the Specified 
Activity 
PG&E proposes to conduct 
construction in San Francisco Bay to 
remediate sediments impacted with 
PAHs. Construction components 
include installation of piles to attach a 
turbidity curtain; installation of 
sediment pins to promote slope 
stability; removal and installation of 
piles to relocate the Blue and Gold Fleet 
(BGF); removal of impacted sediment 
using mechanical dredges; and capping 
and armoring of sediment left in place. 
Underwater noise generated by 
dredging, capping, and armoring are 
within range of other background noise 
in San Francisco Bay and are not 
anticipated to result in take of marine 
mammals. 
Pile driving to install and remove 
piles is expected to result in take of 
marine mammals and these activities 
are described below in detail. 
Turbidity curtain—Because increased 
water turbidity might occur during 
dredging and capping activities, a 
turbidity curtain would be installed 
across the full depth of the water 
column extending to the sediment 
surface. The turbidity curtain would be 
attached to 20 temporary steel shell 
piles less than 12 inches (30.5 
centimeters [cm]) in diameter. The piles 
would be installed with primarily 
vibratory methods. Impact pile driving 
would be used as needed to seat the 
piles. The piles would be removed using 
vibratory methods. 
Slope stabilization—In order to 
prevent rotational or sliding failure in 
dredged and capped areas, 
approximately 500 18-inch (45.7-cm) 
diameter tapered timber piles (referred 
to as sediment pins) would be installed 
using vibratory and impact hammers. 
BGF Relocation—Relocation of the 
BGF would require removal of piles and 
overwater structures at the current 
location and reinstallation after 
remediation actions are complete. Eight 
24-inch (61-cm) steel shell piles, two 42- 
inch (106.7-cm) steel shell piles, and 
five 30-inch (76.2-cm) steel shell piles 
would be removed using vibratory 
methods. These piles would then be 
replaced by eight 30-inch (76.2-cm) steel 
shell piles, five 36-inch (91.4-cm) steel 
shell piles, four 24-inch (61-cm) steel 
shell piles, and four 36-inch (91.4-cm)

Description of Marine Mammals in the 
Area of Specified Activities 
Sections 3 and 4 of the application 
summarize available information 
regarding status and trends, distribution 
and habitat preferences, and behavior 
and life history of the potentially 
affected species. NMFS fully considered 
all of this information, and we refer the 
reader to these descriptions, instead of 
reprinting the information. Additional 
information regarding population trends 
and threats may be found in NMFS’ 
Stock Assessment Reports (SARs; 
https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/ 
national/marine-mammal-protection/ 
marine-mammal-stock-assessments) 
and more general information about 
these species (e.g., physical and behavioral descriptions) may be found 
on NMFS’ website (https://
www.fisheries.noaa.gov/find-species). Table 3 lists all species or stocks for 
which take is expected and proposed to 
be authorized for this activity and 
summarizes information related to the 
population or stock, including 
regulatory status under the MMPA and 
ESA and potential biological removal 
(PBR), where known. PBR is defined by 
the MMPA as the maximum number of 
animals, not including natural 
mortalities, that may be removed from a 
marine mammal stock while allowing 
that stock to reach or maintain its 
optimum sustainable population (as 
described in NMFS’ SARs). While no 
serious injury or mortality is anticipated 
or proposed to be authorized here, PBR 
and annual serious injury and mortality 
(M/SI) from anthropogenic sources are 
included here as gross indicators of the 
status of the species or stocks and other 
threats. 
Marine mammal abundance estimates 
presented in this document represent 
the total number of individuals that 
make up a given stock or the total 
number estimated within a particular 
study or survey area. NMFS’ stock 
abundance estimates for most species 
represent the total estimate of

ESA status: Endangered (E), Threatened (T)/MMPA status: Depleted (D). A dash (-) indicates that the species is not listed under the ESA or designated as de-
pleted under the MMPA. Under the MMPA, a strategic stock is one for which the level of direct human-caused mortality exceeds PBR or which is determined to be 
declining and likely to be listed under the ESA within the foreseeable future. Any species or stock listed under the ESA is automatically designated under the MMPA 
as depleted and as a strategic stock.

These values, found in NMFS’s SARs, represent annual levels of human-caused mortality plus serious injury from all sources combined (e.g., commercial fish-eries, ship strike). Annual M/SI often cannot be determined precisely and is in some cases presented as a minimum value or range. A CV associated with estimated 
mortality due to commercial fisheries is presented in some cases. 
As indicated above, all eight species 
(with nine managed stocks) in table 3 
temporally and spatially co-occur with 
the activity to the degree that take is 
reasonably likely to occur. While the 
humpback whale occasionally enters 
San Francisco Bay, if this species is to 
approach the Level B harassment zone, 
construction will be shutdown. 
Therefore, no take is expected of 
humpback whale and the species will 
not be discussed further. 
With the exception of the gray whale, 
a description of all marine mammals 
proposed for take in this IHA can be 
found in the notice of the proposed 
2024 IHA (88 FR 82836, November 11, 
2023), and the information remains 
applicable to this proposed IHA as well. 
NMFS has reviewed recent draft Stock 
Assessment Reports, information on 
relevant Unusual Mortality Events, and 
recent scientific literature, and 
determined that no new information 
affects our original analysis of impacts 
to these species under this proposed 
IHA. 
For the 2024 IHA, no take was 
authorized for gray whales, and PG&E 
shut down if gray whales approached 
the estimated Level B harassment 
isopleth. During construction conducted 
under the 2024 IHA, gray whales were 
present in San Francisco Bay more than 
expected, resulting in multiple 
instances of shutdown. Therefore, PG&E 
is requesting take for small numbers of 
gray whales by Level B harassment in 
this IHA. Gray whales will be discussed 
below. 
Gray Whale 
During the summer and fall most 
Eastern North Pacific gray whales feed 
in the Chukchi, Beaufort, and 
northwestern Bering Seas, with a small 
number that summer and feed along the 
Pacific coast between Kodiak Island, 
Alaska and northern California. The 
southward migration generally occurs 
from December through February and 
peaks in January, and the northward 
migration generally occurs from 
February through May and peaks in 
March (NOAA National Centers for 
Coastal Ocean Science, 2007). Although 
their presence in San Francisco Bay is 
generally considered uncommon, 
increased numbers of gray whales have 
been seen in San Francisco Bay in 
recent years, and gray whales were 
observed in San Francisco Bay more 
often than expected during PG&E’s 
construction under the 2024 IHA 
(Integral Consulting Inc., 2025a). 
Marine Mammal Hearing 
Hearing is the most important sensory 
modality for marine mammals 
underwater, and exposure to 
anthropogenic sound can have 
deleterious effects. To appropriately 
assess the potential effects of exposure 
to sound, it is necessary to understand 
the frequency ranges marine mammals 
are able to hear. Not all marine mammal 
species have equal hearing capabilities 
(e.g., Au and Hastings, 2008; Richardson et al., 1995; Wartzok and Ketten, 1999). 
To reflect this, Southall et al. (2007, 
2019) recommended that marine 
mammals be divided into hearing 
groups based on directly measured 
(behavioral or auditory evoked potential 
techniques) or estimated hearing ranges 
(behavioral response data, anatomical 
modeling, etc.). Generalized hearing ranges were chosen based on the 65 
decibel (dB) threshold from composite 
audiograms, previous analyses in NMFS 
(2018), and/or data from Southall et al. 
(2007, 2019). We note that the names of 
two hearing groups and the generalized 
hearing ranges of all marine mammal 
hearing groups have been recently 
updated (NMFS, 2024) as reflected 
below in table 4.

Potential Effects of Specified Activities 
on Marine Mammals and Their Habitat 
A description of the potential effects 
of the specified activities on marine 
mammals and their habitat may be 
found in the notice of the proposed 
2024 IHA (88 FR 82836, November 27, 
2023). 
Estimated Take of Marine Mammals 
This section provides an estimate of 
the number of incidental takes proposed 
for authorization through the IHA, 
which will inform NMFS’ consideration 
of ‘‘small numbers,’’ the negligible 
impact determinations, and impacts on 
subsistence uses. 
Harassment is the only type of take 
expected to result from these activities. 
Except with respect to certain activities 
not pertinent here, section 3(18) of the 
MMPA defines ‘‘harassment’’ as any act 
of pursuit, torment, or annoyance, 
which (i) has the potential to injure a 
marine mammal or marine mammal 
stock in the wild (Level A harassment); 
or (ii) has the potential to disturb a 
marine mammal or marine mammal 
stock in the wild by causing disruption 
of behavioral patterns, including, but 
not limited to, migration, breathing, 
nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering 
(Level B harassment). 
Authorized takes would be by Level B 
harassment only, in the form of 
behavioral reactions and/or temporary 
threshold shift (TTS) for individual 
marine mammals resulting from 
exposure to pile driving. Based on the 
nature of the activity and the 
anticipated effectiveness of the 
mitigation measures (i.e., shutdown at the Level A harassment isopleth) 
discussed in detail below in the 
Proposed Mitigation section, Level A 
harassment is neither anticipated nor 
proposed to be authorized. 
As described previously, no serious 
injury or mortality is anticipated or 
proposed to be authorized for this 
activity. Below we describe how the 
proposed take numbers are estimated. 
For acoustic impacts, generally 
speaking, we estimate take by 
considering: (1) acoustic criteria above 
which NMFS believes there is some 
reasonable potential for marine 
mammals to be behaviorally harassed or 
incur some degree of auditory injury 
(AUD INJ); (2) the area or volume of 
water that will be ensonified above 
these levels in a day; (3) the density or 
occurrence of marine mammals within 
these ensonified areas; and, (4) the 
number of days of activities. We note 
that while these factors can contribute 
to a basic calculation to provide an 
initial prediction of potential takes, 
additional information that can 
qualitatively inform take estimates is 
also sometimes available (e.g., previous monitoring results or average group 
size). Below, we describe the factors 
considered here in more detail and 
present the proposed take estimates. 
Acoustic Criteria 
NMFS recommends the use of 
acoustic criteria that identify the 
received level of underwater sound 
above which exposed marine mammals 
would be reasonably expected to be 
behaviorally harassed (equated to Level 
B harassment) or to incur AUD INJ of 
some degree (equated to Level A 
harassment). 
Level B Harassment—Though 
significantly driven by received level, 
the onset of behavioral disturbance from 
anthropogenic noise exposure is also 
informed to varying degrees by other 
factors related to the source or exposure 
context (e.g., frequency, predictability, duty cycle, duration of the exposure, 
signal-to-noise ratio, distance to the 
source), the environment (e.g., 
bathymetry, other noises in the area, 
predators in the area), and the receiving 
animals (hearing, motivation, 
experience, demography, life stage, 
depth) and can be difficult to predict 
(e.g., Southall et al., 2007, 2021; Ellison et al., 2012). Based on what the 
available science indicates and the 
practical need to use a threshold based 
on a metric that is both predictable and 
measurable for most activities, NMFS 
typically uses a generalized acoustic 
threshold based on received level to 
estimate the onset of behavioral 
harassment. NMFS generally predicts 
that marine mammals are likely to be 
behaviorally harassed in a manner 
considered to be Level B harassment 
when exposed to underwater 
anthropogenic noise above root-mean- 
squared pressure received levels (RMS 
SPL) of 120 dB (referenced to 1 
micropascal (re 1 mPa)) for continuous 
(e.g., vibratory pile driving, drilling) and above RMS SPL 160 dB re 1 mPa for non- 
explosive impulsive (e.g., seismic airguns) or intermittent (e.g., scientific sonar) sources. Generally speaking, 
Level B harassment take estimates based 
on these behavioral harassment 
thresholds are expected to include any 
likely takes by TTS as, in most cases, 
the likelihood of TTS occurs at 
distances from the source less than 
those at which behavioral harassment is 
likely. TTS of a sufficient degree can 
manifest as behavioral harassment, as 
reduced hearing sensitivity and the 
potential reduced opportunities to 
detect important signals (conspecific 
communication, predators, prey) may 
result in changes in behavior patterns 
that would not otherwise occur. 
PG&E’s proposed construction activity 
includes the use of continuous 
(vibratory pile driving) and impulsive 
(impact pile driving) sources, and 
therefore the RMS SPL thresholds of 120 
and 160 dB re 1 mPa are applicable.

ommended for consideration for non-impulsive sources. 
Note: Peak sound pressure level (Lp,0-pk
) has a reference value of 1 µPa, and weighted cumulative sound exposure level (LE,p
) has a ref-
erence value of 1 µPa
2
s. In this table, criteria are abbreviated to be more reflective of International Organization for Standardization standards 
(ISO, 2017). The subscript ‘‘flat’’ is being included to indicate peak sound pressure are flat weighted or unweighted within the generalized hear-
ing range of marine mammals underwater (i.e., 7 Hz to 165 kHz). The subscript associated with cumulative sound exposure level criteria indi-cates the designated marine mammal auditory weighting function (LF, HF, and VHF cetaceans, and PW and OW pinnipeds) and that the rec-
ommended accumulation period is 24 hours. The weighted cumulative sound exposure level criteria could be exceeded in a multitude of ways 
(i.e., varying exposure levels and durations, duty cycle). When possible, it is valuable for action proponents to indicate the conditions under which these criteria will be exceeded. 
Ensonified Area 
Here, we describe operational and 
environmental parameters of the activity 
that are used in estimating the area 
ensonified above the acoustic 
thresholds, including source levels and 
transmission loss coefficient. 
The sound field in the project area is 
the existing background noise plus 
additional construction noise from the 
proposed project. Marine mammals are 
expected to be affected via sound 
generated by the primary components of 
the project (i.e., pile driving and removal). 
The project includes vibratory pile 
installation and removal and impact 
pile installation. Source levels for these 
activities are based on hydroacoustic 
monitoring conducted under the 2024 
IHA (Reyff and Ambaskar, 2025) and 
2025 renewal IHA (Illingworth & 
Rodkin, 2025) and on reviews of 
measurements of the same or similar 
types and dimensions of piles available 
in the literature. Source levels for each 
pile size are presented in table 6. Source 
levels for vibratory installation and 
removal of piles of the same diameter 
are assumed to be the same. PG&E plans 
to use a bubble curtain for all impact 
pile driving, and a 5 dB reduction in 
source level is assumed from those 
presented in table 6 for impact pile 
driving due to the use of a bubble 
curtain.

I  I 60642 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices Level B Harassment Zones— 
Transmission loss (TL) is the decrease 
in acoustic intensity as an acoustic 
pressure wave propagates out from a 
source. TL parameters vary with 
frequency, temperature, sea conditions, 
current, source and receiver depth, 
water depth, water chemistry, and 
bottom composition topography. The 
general formula for underwater TL is: 
TL = B * Log10 (R
1
/R
2
), 
Where: 
TL = transmission loss in dB; 
B = transmission loss coefficient; 
R
1
= the distance of the modeled SPL from 
the driven pile; and 
R
2
= the distance from the driven pile of the 
initial measurement. 
Absent site-specific data, the 
recommended TL coefficient for most 
nearshore environments is the practical 
spreading value of 15. This value results 
in an expected propagation environment 
that would lie between spherical and 
cylindrical spreading loss conditions, 
known as practical spreading. As is 
common practice in coastal waters, here 
we assume practical spreading (4.5 dB 
reduction in sound level for each 
doubling of distance) for all impact and 
vibratory installation of piles without 
site-specific acoustical monitoring (i.e., 
impact installation of 12-, 24- 30-, and 
36-inch [30.5-, 61-, 76.2-, and 91.4-cm] 
steel shell piles, vibratory and impact 
installation of 18-inch [45.7-cm] tapered 
timber piles, and vibratory installation 
of 42-inch [106.7-cm] steel shell piles). 
As described above, PG&E conducted 
hydroacoustic monitoring for the 
vibratory installation of 12-, 24-, 30-, 
and 36-inch (61-, 76.2-, and 91.4-cm) 
steel shell piles, and the TL coefficients 
were 22, 24.9, 22.5, and 23.9, 
respectively (Reyff and Ambaskar, 2025, 
Illingworth & Rodkin, 2025). PG&E 
proposes to use these site specific TL 
coefficients for the respective piles, and 
NMFS concurs. 
The ensonified area associated with 
Level A harassment is more technically 
challenging to predict due to the need 
to account for a duration component. 
Therefore, NMFS developed an optional 
User Spreadsheet tool to accompany the 
2024 Updated Technical Guidance that 
can be used to relatively simply predict 
an isopleth distance for use in 
conjunction with marine mammal 
density or occurrence to help predict 
potential takes. We note that because of 
some of the assumptions included in the 
methods underlying this optional tool, 
we anticipate that the resulting isopleth 
estimates are typically going to be 
overestimates of some degree, which 
may result in an overestimate of 
potential take by Level A harassment. 
However, this optional tool offers the 
best way to estimate isopleth distances 
when more sophisticated modeling 
methods are not available or practical. 
For stationary sources, such as pile 
driving, the optional User Spreadsheet 
tool predicts the distance at which, if a 
marine mammal remained at that 
distance for the duration of the activity, 
it would be expected to incur AUD INJ. 
Inputs used in the NMFS User 
Spreadsheet are provided in table 7. 
Level A and Level B harassment 
isopleths are provided in table 8.

Marine Mammal Occurrence 
In this section we provide information 
about the occurrence of marine 
mammals, including density or other 
relevant information which will inform 
the take calculations. 
Because reliable marine mammal 
density information is not available for 
San Francisco Bay, PG&E reviewed 
several resources and datasets to 
estimate marine mammal occurrence. 
These datasets include (but are not 
limited to): 
€5 years of sighting and stranding data from The Marine Mammal Center 
(TMMC) (NMFS, 2021b as cited by 
Integral Consulting Inc., 2025a) and 
California Academy of Sciences (CAS) 
(NMFS, 2021a as cited by Integral 
Consulting Inc., 2025a); 
€Monitoring data collected over 5 days in Remedial Response Areas A, B, 
and C in 2020 during sediment 
investigations in the initial phase of the 
sediment remediation project (Haase, 
2021); 
€Monitoring data collected over 11 days of construction in Remedial 
Response Areas A and B in the Spring 
of 2025 (Integral Consulting Inc., 
2025b); 
€Counts from nearby haulouts; and €Citizen-reported live sightings from https://www.iNaturalist.org; 
Depending on the distribution of 
sightings and granularity of data, 
different sources have been used to 
estimate the number of individuals of 
each species with the potential to occur 
in the vicinity of the project. 
Gray Whale 
Gray whales may enter the Bay in late 
winter and early spring or in the fall 
during their migrations and, in recent 
years, there have been an increased 
number of gray whales in the western 
and Central Bay (Integral Consulting 
Inc., 2025a). During construction in 
March-April 2025, multiple gray whales 
were observed in San Francisco Bay 
(Integral Consulting Inc., 2025b). 
According to TMMC, in June 2025, 9 
individual gray whales were observed in 
June over 14 days (TMMC, unpublished 
data). PG&E estimates that one gray 
whale will occur in the project area 
every other day (0.5 whales/day), and 
NMFS concurs with this approach. 
Bottlenose Dolphin 
Historically, observations of 
bottlenose dolphins have occurred west 
of Treasure Island and were 
concentrated along the nearshore area of 
San Francisco south to Redwood City. 
Since 2016, one individual has been 
regularly seen near the former Alameda 
Air Station, and five animals were 
regularly seen in the summer and fall of 
2018 in the same location (Integral 
Consulting Inc., 2025a). In February 
2019, an adult and juvenile were seen 
on two separate occasions northwest of 
the Oakland Inner Harbor, 
approximately 4 mi (6.4 km) from 
PG&E’s proposed project area (Integral 
Consulting Inc., 2025a). No bottlenose 
dolphins were observed during pre- 
construction monitoring in 2020 (Haase, 
2021) or during construction in the 
spring of 2025 (Integral Consulting Inc., 
2025b). Although bottlenose dolphins 
are relatively uncommon in San 
Francisco Bay, NMFS conservatively 
assumes that one group of bottlenose 
dolphins will be present in the project 
area per month of construction. A group 
size is estimated to be five animals 
based on sightings of bottlenose 
dolphins in San Francisco Bay (Integral 
Consulting Inc., 2025a). 
Harbor Porpoise 
Harbor porpoise are primarily seen 
near the Golden Gate Bridge, Marin 
County, and the city of San Francisco on 
the northwest side of San Francisco Bay 
(Keener et al., 2012; Stern et al., 2017). CAS recorded 29 harbor porpoises (only 
2 of which were alive) over the past 5 
years, and https://www.iNaturalist.org 
recorded 11 harbor porpoise in San 
Francisco Bay over the past 2 years. 
During 2020 monitoring, an individual 
harbor porpoise was seen within the 
project area on 2 of the 5 monitoring 
days (Haase, 2021), and a single harbor 
porpoise was observed within the Level 
B harassment zone during 11 days of 
monitoring in the spring of 2025 
(Integral Consulting Inc., 2025b). PG&E 
estimates that two harbor porpoises will 
occur within the project area per day, 
and NMFS concurs. 
California Sea Lion 
Remedial Response Area C, where 
PG&E proposes to conduct construction, 
is adjacent to the Pier 39 K-Dock where 
California sea lions regularly haul out. 
The Sea Lion Center at Pier 39 regularly 
counted the sea lions at K-Dock from 
1991 through 2018, and from 2016 
through 2018, the yearly average ranged 
from 89 to 229 animals per day, and the 
average over all 3 years was 191 
(Integral Consulting Inc., 2025a). Over 5 
days of monitoring in 2020, a total of 
463 sea lions were observed, ranging 
from 56 to 129 per day (Haase, 2021). 
During construction in March and April 
2025, California sea lions were seen on 
each of 11 monitoring days, with a total 
of 92 California sea lions seen, ranging 
from 3 to 18 California sea lions per day 
(Integral Consulting Inc., 2025b). 
Although there are times of year when 
the K-Dock is unoccupied or there are 
few individuals present, it is difficult to 
predict abundance based on the time of 
year. Therefore, PG&E is conservatively 
assuming 191 sea lions per day, based 
on the average K-dock counts, and 
NMFS concurs. 
Northern Fur Seal 
TMMC recorded 44 northern fur seals 
in San Francisco Bay from 2016 to 2021 
(NMFS, 2021b). CAS recorded an 
additional 3 for a total of 47 over 5 years 
(NMFS, 2021a), yielding 0.03 norther 
fur seals per day, or approximately 10

I  I  I  I 60644 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices northern fur seals per year. No fur seals 
were observed during monitoring efforts 
in 2020 and 2025 (Integral Consulting 
Inc., 2025b; Haase, 2021). In the fall and 
winter, northern fur seals occasionally 
strand on Yerba Buena Island and 
Treasure Island (Integral Consulting 
Inc., 2025a), approximately 2 mi (3.2 
km) from PG&E’s proposed project area. 
Using PG&E’s assumption of 
approximately 0.03 fur seals per day 
over the course of 62 days of pile 
driving plus a history of known fur seal 
strandings near the project area, NMFS 
has determined it appropriate to assume 
5 fur seals in the project area over the 
course of construction. 
Steller Sea Lion 
Steller sea lions are rare in San 
Francisco Bay. TMMC recorded four 
Steller sea lions in San Francisco Bay 
from 2016 to 2021 (NMFS, 2021b), and 
CAS recorded no Steller sea lions over 
the same time frame (NMFS, 2021a). On 
rare occasions, Steller sea lions are seen 
on the Pier 39 K-Dock haulout. An adult 
male was spotted there in May 2023 
(Segura, 2023), and, in previous years, a 
single male Steller sea lion had been 
observed using the Pier 39 K-Dock 
haulout intermittently during July and 
August and occasionally September 
(Integral Consulting Inc., 2025a). No 
Steller sea lions were observed during 
the 2020 or 2025 monitoring (Haase, 
2021; Integral Consulting Inc., 2025b). 
Given the known occasional 
occurrences of Steller sea lions at Pier 
39, NMFS feels it is appropriate to 
assume five Steller sea lions in PG&E’s 
proposed project area during the time 
period of construction. 
Harbor Seal 
Harbor seals in San Francisco Bay 
forage mainly within 7 mi (11.3 km) of 
their primary haulout site (Grigg et al., 
2012) and often within just 1–3 mi (1.6– 
4.8 km) (Torok, 1994). The only harbor 
seal haulout within 7 mi (11.3 km) of 
the project site is Yerba Buena Island, 
which is 3.1 mi (5 km) to the east of the 
Project Area. Aside from the vibratory 
removal of 42-inch (106.7-cm) steel 
shell piles, the largest Level B 
harassment zone is 2,006 m (vibratory 
installation of 30-inch [76.2 cm]), and 
the Level B harassment isopleths are not 
expected to reach the Yerba Buena 
haulout. However, harbor seals that use 
this haulout are likely to forage within 
ensonified areas from the project. 
During 5 days of monitoring in 2020, 60 
harbor seals were observed, with a 
maximum of 20 seals observed in one 
day (Haase, 2021). During 11 days of 
monitoring in 2025, two harbor seals 
were observed in the project area 
(Integral Consulting Inc., 2025b). Based 
on this data, PG&E assumes 20 harbor 
seals will be within the Level B 
harassment isopleth per day, and NMFS 
concurs. 
PG&E proposes to conduct vibratory 
removal of 42-inch (106.7-cm) steel 
shell piles over 2 days (one pile per 
day). The Level B harassment isopleth 
for the vibratory removal of the 42-inch 
(106.7-cm) steel shell pile is 21,544 m. 
This isopleth would extend to Castro 
Rocks in northern San Francisco Bay, 
which is a well-known harbor seal 
haulout, and therefore, PG&E proposes 
to add harbor seals from Castro Rocks 
haulout to the take determined by the 
daily occurrence estimate described 
above. The National Park Service 
conducts annual surveys of haulouts in 
San Francisco Bay. Over the past 10 
years of surveys, the highest mean 
number of harbor seals observed at 
Castro Rocks was 237 seals (in 2019) 
(Codde, 2020; Codde & Allen, 2017, 
2018, 2020, 2025). The vibratory 
removal of 42-inch (106.7-cm) steel 
shell piles is expected to last 
approximately 20 minutes each day. 
PG&E estimates that 50 harbor seals 
from Castro Rocks will occur within the 
Level B harassment isopleth during each 
day of vibratory removal of 42-inch 
(106.7-cm) steel shell piles, resulting in 
100 harbor seals. 
Northern Elephant Seal 
TMMC recorded 903 northern 
elephant seals in San Francisco Bay 
from 2016 to 2021 (NMFS, 2021b). The 
CAS reported an additional 6 northern 
elephant seals over the same time frame 
(NMFS, 2021a), for a total of 909 seals, 
yielding an average of 0.5 elephant seals 
per day. No northern elephant seals 
were observed during monitoring efforts 
conducted in 2020 and 2025 (Haase, 
2021; Integral Consulting Inc., 2025b). 
In order to ensure sufficient 
authorization of northern elephant seal 
takes, PG&E assumed 0.5 elephant seals 
will occur in the proposed project area 
per day (i.e., one elephant seal every 2 days). NMFS concurs with this 
assumption. 
Take Estimation 
Here we describe how the information 
provided above is synthesized to 
produce a quantitative estimate of the 
take that is reasonably likely to occur 
and proposed for authorization. 
To estimate take by Level B 
harassment for gray whale, harbor 
porpoise, California sea lion, and 
northern elephant seal the expected 
daily occurrence was multiplied by the 
estimated number of 62 pile driving 
days (see table 9). Similarly, for harbor 
seals, the expected daily occurrence was 
multiplied by the estimated number of 
62 pile driving days and 100 harbor 
seals was added to this number to 
account for take of harbor seals at Castro 
Rocks during 2 days of vibratory 
removal of 42-inch (106.7-cm) steel 
shell piles (50 harbor seals per day) (see 
table 9). For northern fur seals and 
Steller sea lions, PG&E is assuming five 
animals of each species will occur in the 
proposed project area during the course 
of PG&E’s construction (see table 9). For 
bottlenose dolphins, PG&E estimates 
that one group of five bottlenose 
dolphins will occur in the proposed 
project area per month of pile driving. 
Based on 5 months of pile driving, 
NMFS proposes to authorize 25 takes of 
bottlenose dolphins by Level B 
harassment (table 9).

In order to issue an IHA under section 
101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA, NMFS must 
set forth the permissible methods of 
taking pursuant to the activity, and 
other means of effecting the least 
practicable impact on the species or 
stock and its habitat, paying particular 
attention to rookeries, mating grounds, 
and areas of similar significance, and on 
the availability of the species or stock 
for taking for certain subsistence uses 
(latter not applicable for this action). 
NMFS regulations require applicants for 
incidental take authorizations (ITAs) to 
include information about the 
availability and feasibility (economic 
and technological) of equipment, 
methods, and manner of conducting the 
activity or other means of effecting the 
least practicable adverse impact upon 
the affected species or stocks, and their 
habitat (50 CFR 216.104(a)(11)). 
In evaluating how mitigation may or 
may not be appropriate to ensure the 
least practicable adverse impact on 
species or stocks and their habitat, as 
well as subsistence uses where 
applicable, NMFS considers two 
primary factors: 
(1) The manner in which, and the 
degree to which, the successful 
implementation of the measure(s) is 
expected to reduce impacts to marine 
mammals, marine mammal species or 
stocks, and their habitat. This considers 
the nature of the potential adverse 
impact being mitigated (likelihood, 
scope, range). It further considers the 
likelihood that the measure will be 
effective if implemented (probability of 
accomplishing the mitigating result if 
implemented as planned), the 
likelihood of effective implementation 
(probability implemented as planned), 
and; 
(2) The practicability of the measures 
for applicant implementation, which 
may consider such things as cost, and 
impact on operations. 
The mitigation requirements 
described in the following were 
proposed by PG&E in its adequate and 
complete application or are the result of 
subsequent coordination between NMFS 
and PG&E. PG&E has agreed that all of 
the mitigation measures are practicable. 
NMFS has fully reviewed the specified 
activities and the mitigation measures to 
determine if the mitigation measures 
would result in the least practicable 
adverse impact on marine mammals and 
their habitat, as required by the MMPA, 
and has determined the proposed 
measures are appropriate. NMFS 
describes these below as proposed 
mitigation requirements, and has 
included them in the proposed IHA. 
Shutdown Zones 
PG&E must establish shutdown zones 
for all pile driving activities. The 
purpose of a shutdown zones is 
generally to define an area within which 
shutdown of the activity would occur 
upon sighting of a marine mammal (or 
in anticipation of an animal entering the 
defined area). Shutdown zones will vary 
based on the activity type and marine 
mammal hearing group (see table 10). 
Specifically, PG&E will establish 
shutdown zones for otariids based on 
the otariid Level A harassment zone and 
shutdown zones for all other marine 
mammals based on the largest Level A 
harassment zone for each pile size/type 
and driving method, as shown in table 
10. A minimum shutdown zone of 10 m 
would be required for all in-water 
construction activities to avoid physical 
interaction with marine mammals.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60646 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices Prior to pile driving, shutdown zones 
will be established based on zones 
represented in table 10. Protected 
species observers (PSOs) will survey the 
shutdown zones for at least 30 minutes 
before pile driving activities start. If 
marine mammals are found within the 
shutdown zone, pile driving will be 
delayed until the animal has moved out 
of the shutdown zone, either verified by 
a PSO or by waiting until 15 minutes 
has elapsed without a sighting. If a 
marine mammal approaches or enters 
the shutdown zone during pile driving, 
the activity will be halted. Pile driving 
may resume after the animal has moved 
out of and is moving away from the 
shutdown zone or after at least 15 
minutes has passed since the last 
observation of the animal. 
If a species for which authorization 
has not been granted, or a species which 
has been granted but the authorized 
takes are met, is observed approaching 
or within the Level B harassment zone, 
pile driving activities will be shutdown. 
Activities will not resume until the 
animal has been confirmed to have left 
the area or 15 minutes has elapsed with 
no sighing of the animal. 
Protected Species Observers 
The placement of PSOs during all pile 
driving activities (described in the 
Proposed Monitoring and Reporting 
section) would ensure that the entire 
shutdown zone is visible. Should 
environmental conditions deteriorate 
such that the entire shutdown zone 
would not be visible (e.g., fog, heavy rain), pile driving would be delayed 
until the PSO is confident marine 
mammals within the shutdown zone 
could be detected. PSOs would monitor 
the full shutdown zones and as much of 
the Level B harassment zones as 
possible. 
Pre- and Post-Activity Monitoring 
Monitoring must take place from 30 
minutes prior to initiation of pile 
driving activities (i.e., pre-clearance monitoring) through 30 minutes post- 
completion of pile driving. Prior to the 
start of daily in-water construction 
activity, or whenever a break in pile 
driving of 30 minutes or longer occurs, 
PSOs would observe the shutdown 
zones for a period of 30 minutes. The 
shutdown zone would be considered 
cleared when a marine mammal has not 
been observed within the zone for a 30- 
minute period. If a marine mammal is 
observed within shutdown zones, pile 
driving activity would be delayed or 
halted. When a marine mammal for 
which take by Level B harassment is 
authorized is present in the Level B 
harassment zone, activities may begin 
and take by Level B harassment will be 
recorded. If work ceases for more than 
30 minutes, the pre-activity monitoring 
of the shutdown zones would 
commence. A determination that the 
shutdown zone is clear must be made 
during a period of good visibility (i.e., 
the entire shutdown zone and 
surrounding waters must be visible to 
the naked eye). 
Soft-Start Procedures 
Soft-start procedures are used to 
provide additional protection to marine 
mammals by providing warning and/or 
giving marine mammals a change to 
leave the area prior to the hammer 
operating at full capacity. For impact 
pile driving, contractors would be 
required to provide an initial set of three 
strikes from the hammer at reduced 
energy, followed by a 30-second waiting 
period, then two subsequent reduced- 
energy strike sets. Soft start would be 
implemented at the start of each day’s 
impact pile driving and at any time 
following cessation of impact pile 
driving for a period of 30 minutes or 
longer. 
Bubble Curtain 
A bubble curtain must be employed 
during all impact pile driving. The 
bubble curtain must distribute air 
bubbles around 100 percent of the piling 
circumference for the full depth of the 
water column. The lowest bubble ring 
must be in contact with the mudline for 
the full circumference of the ring. The 
weights attached to the bottom ring 
must ensure 100 percent substrate 
contact. No parts of the ring or other 
objects may prevent full substrate 
contact. Air flow to the bubblers must 
be balanced around the circumference 
of the pile. 
NMFS conducted an independent 
evaluation of the proposed measures, 
and has preliminarily determined that 
the proposed mitigation measures 
provide the means of effecting the least 
practicable impact on the affected 
species or stocks and their habitat, 
paying particular attention to rookeries, 
mating grounds, and areas of similar 
significance. 
Proposed Monitoring and Reporting 
In order to issue an IHA for an 
activity, section 101(a)(5)(D) of the 
MMPA states that NMFS must set forth 
requirements pertaining to the 
monitoring and reporting of such taking. 
The MMPA implementing regulations at 
50 CFR 216.104(a)(13) indicate that 
requests for authorizations must include 
the suggested means of accomplishing 
the necessary monitoring and reporting 
that will result in increased knowledge 
of the species and of the level of taking 
or impacts on populations of marine 
mammals that are expected to be 
present while conducting the activities. 
Effective reporting is critical both to 
compliance as well as ensuring that the 
most value is obtained from the required 
monitoring. 
Monitoring and reporting 
requirements prescribed by NMFS 
should contribute to improved 
understanding of one or more of the 
following: 
€Occurrence of marine mammal species or stocks in the area in which 
take is anticipated (e.g., presence, abundance, distribution, density); 
€Nature, scope, or context of likely marine mammal exposure to potential 
stressors/impacts (individual or 
cumulative, acute or chronic), through 
better understanding of: (1) action or 
environment (e.g., source characterization, propagation, ambient

of marine mammal species with the 
activity; or (4) biological or behavioral 
context of exposure (e.g., age, calving or feeding areas); 
€Individual marine mammal responses (behavioral or physiological) 
to acoustic stressors (acute, chronic, or 
cumulative), other stressors, or

The monitoring and reporting 
requirements described in the following 
were proposed by PG&E in its adequate 
and complete application and/or are the 
result of subsequent coordination 
between NMFS and PG&E. PG&E has 
agreed to the requirements. NMFS 
describes these below as requirements 
and has included them in the proposed 
IHA. 
Visual Monitoring 
Marine mammal monitoring must be 
conducted in accordance with the 
conditions in this section and the IHA. 
Marine mammal monitoring during pile 
driving and removal must be conducted 
by NMFS-approved PSOs in a manner 
consistent with the following: 
€PSOs must be independent of the activity contractor (for example,

no other assigned tasks during 
monitoring periods; 
€At least one PSO would have prior experience performing the duties of a 
PSO during construction activity 
pursuant to a NMFS’ issued ITA; 
€Other PSOs may substitute education (degree in biological science 
or related field) or training for 
experience; 
€Where a team of three or more PSOs is required, a lead observer or 
monitoring coordinator would be 
designated. The lead observer would be 
required to have prior experience 
working as a marine mammal observer 
during construction; 
€PSOs must be approved by NMFS prior to beginning any activity subject to 
the IHA. 
PSOs should have the following 
additional qualifications: 
€Ability to conduct field observations and collect data according 
to assigned protocols; 
€Experience or training in the field identification of marine mammals, 
including the identification of behavior; 
€Sufficient training, orientation, or experience with the construction 
operation to provide for personal safety 
during observations; 
€Writing skills sufficient to prepare a report of observations including but not 
limited to the number and species of 
marine mammals observed; dates and 
times when in-water construction 
activities were conducted; dates, times, 
and reason for implementation of 
mitigation (or why mitigation was not 
implemented when required); and 
marine mammal behavior; and 
€Ability to communicate orally, by radio or in person, with project 
personnel to prove real-time 
information on marine mammals 
observed in the area as necessary. 
PG&E would have between one and 
three PSOs on site at all times during 
pile driving activities. One PSO would 
be designated as the Lead PSO and 
would receive updates from the other 
PSOs. The Lead PSO would be stationed 
at the active pile driving rig or at the 
best vantage point practicable to 
monitor the shutdown zones and 
implement shutdown and delay 
procedures. The other PSOs would be 
stationed at the best vantage points 
practicable to observe the monitoring 
zones. Exact locations would be 
determined in the field based on the 
pile driving site, field conditions, and in 
coordination with contractors, but may 
include docks, barges, and tower 
structures. PSOs would be equipped 
with high quality binoculars or spotting 
scopes for monitoring and radios and 
cell phones for maintaining contact with 
other observers and work crew. 
Monitoring would be conducted 30 
minutes before, during, and 30 minutes 
after all in-water construction activities. 
PSOs would record all incidents of 
marine mammal occurrence, regardless 
of distance from activity, and would 
document any behavioral reactions in 
concert with distance from piles being 
driven or removed. Pile driving 
activities include the time to install or 
remove a single pile or series of piles, 
as long as the time elapsed between uses 
of the pile driving equipment is no more 
than 30 minutes. 
Hydroacoustic Monitoring 
Hydroacoustic monitoring, to be 
conducted for purposes of measuring 
sound source levels and sound 
propagation, will be conducted in 
accordance with a NMFS-approved 
acoustic monitoring plan. PG&E plans to 
conduct hydroacoustic monitoring 
throughout the entirety of the sediment 
remediation project, which is expected 
to span over multiple ITAs. Across the 
entire project, PG&E will collect data on 
a representative number of piles (at least 
10 percent of each pile type and 
installation method). Given that PG&E’s 
proposed hydroacoustic monitoring 
effort would span multiple IHAs, 
specific effort under any given IHA may 
vary. Therefore, under this proposed 
IHA, PG&E will only conduct 
hydroacoustic monitoring for pile types/ 
installation methods for which 
hydroacoustic monitoring has not been 
previously conducted. PG&E may 
request that NMFS adjust the shutdown 
zones and revise the Level A and Level 
B harassment zones, as appropriate, 
pending NMFS’ review and approval of 
the results of acoustic monitoring. 
Reporting 
Marine Mammal Monitoring Report 
PG&E must submit a draft marine 
mammal monitoring report to NMFS 
within 90 days after the completion of 
pile driving activities, or 60 days prior 
to the requested issuance of any future 
IHAs for the project, or other projects at 
the same location, whichever comes 
first. A final report must be prepared 
and submitted within 30 calendar days 
of following receipt of any NMFS 
comments on the draft report. If no 
comments are received from NMFS 
within 30 calendar days of receipt of the 
draft report, the report shall be 
considered final. The marine mammal 
report would include an overall 
description of work completed, a 
narrative regarding marine mammal 
sightings, and associated PSO data 
sheets and/or raw sighting data. 
Specifically, the report would include: 
€Dates and times (begin and end) of all marine mammal monitoring; 
€Construction activities occurring during each daily observation period, 
including: (a) the number and type of 
piles that were driven and the method 
(e.g., impact, vibratory); and (b) total duration of driving time for each pile 
(vibratory driving) and number of 
strikes for each pile (impact driving); 
€PSO locations during marine mammal monitoring; 
€Environmental conditions during monitoring periods (at beginning and 
end of PSO shift and whenever 
conditions change significantly), 
including Beaufort sea state and any 
other relevant weather conditions 
including cloud cover, fog, sun glare, 
and overall visibility to the horizon, and 
estimated observable distance; 
€Upon observation of a marine mammal, the following information 
must be recorded: (a) name of PSO who 
sighted the animal(s) and PSO location 
and activity at time of sighting; (b) time 
of sighting; (c) identification of the 
animal(s) (e.g., genus/species, lowest possible taxonomic level, or 
unidentified), PSO confidence in 
identification, and the composition of 
the group if there is a mix of species; (d) 
distance and location of each observed 
marine mammal relative to the pile 
being driven for each sighting; (e) 
estimated number of animals (min/max/ 
best estimate); (f) estimated number of 
animals by cohort (adults, juveniles, 
neonates, group composition, etc.); (g) 
animal’s closest point of approach and 
estimated time spent within the 
harassment zone; (h) description of any 
marine mammal behavioral observations 
(e.g., observed behaviors such as feeding or traveling), including an assessment of 
behavioral responses thought to have 
resulted from the activity (e.g., no response or changes in behavioral state 
such as ceasing feeding, changing 
direction, flushing, or breaching); and (i) 
description of any actions implemented 
in response to the sighting (e.g., delays, shutdown) and time and location of the 
action; 
€Number of marine mammals detected within the harassment zones, 
by species; and 
€Summary information about implementation of any mitigation (e.g., 
shutdowns and delays), a description of 
specific actions that ensued, and 
resulting changes in behavior of the 
animal(s), if any.

averaged); 
€One-third octave band spectrum and power spectral density plot; and 
€Transmission loss values for each pile size and type and installation 
method, when appropriate. 
Reporting Injured or Dead Marine 
Mammals 
In the event that personnel involved 
in the construction activities discover 
an injured or dead marine mammal, 
PG&E must report the incident to the 
Office of Protected Resources, NMFS 
(PR.ITP.MonitoringReports@noaa.gov) and to the West Coast regional stranding 
network (866–767–6114) as soon as 
feasible. If the death or injury was 
clearly caused by the specified activity, 
PG&E would immediately cease the 
specified activities until NMFS is able 
to review the circumstances of the 
incident and determine what, if any, 
additional measures are appropriate to 
ensure compliance with the terms of the 
IHA. PG&E would not resume their 
activities until notified by NMFS. The 
report would include the following 
information: 
€Time, date, and location (latitude/ longitude) of the first discovery (and 
updated location information if known 
and applicable); 
€Species identification (if known) or description of the animal(s) involved; 
€Condition of the animal(s) (including carcass condition if the 
animal is dead); 
€Observed behaviors of the animal(s), if alive; 
€If available, photographs or video footage of the animal(s); and 
€General circumstances under which the animal was discovered. 
Negligible Impact Analysis and 
Determination 
NMFS has defined negligible impact 
as an impact resulting from the 
specified activity that cannot be 
reasonably expected to, and is not 
reasonably likely to, adversely affect the 
species or stock through effects on 
annual rates of recruitment or survival 
(50 CFR 216.103). A negligible impact 
finding is based on the lack of likely 
adverse effects on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival (i.e., population- level effects). An estimate of the number 
of takes alone is not enough information 
on which to base an impact 
determination. In addition to 
considering estimates of the number of 
marine mammals that might be ‘‘taken’’ 
through harassment, NMFS considers 
other factors, such as the likely nature 
of any impacts or responses (e.g., 
intensity, duration), the context of any 
impacts or responses (e.g., critical reproductive time or location, foraging 
impacts affecting energetics), as well as 
effects on habitat, and the likely 
effectiveness of the mitigation. We also 
assess the number, intensity, and 
context of estimated takes by evaluating 
this information relative to population 
status. Consistent with the 1989 
preamble for NMFS’ implementing 
regulations (54 FR 40338, September 29, 
1989), the impacts from other past and 
ongoing anthropogenic activities are 
incorporated into this analysis via their 
impacts on the baseline (e.g., as reflected in the regulatory status of the 
species, population size and growth rate 
where known, ongoing sources of 
human-caused mortality, or ambient 
noise levels). 
To avoid repetition, the discussion of 
our analysis applies to all the species 
listed in table 3, given that the 
anticipated effects of this activity on 
these different marine mammal stocks 
are expected to be similar. There is little 
information about the nature or severity 
of the impacts, or the size, status, or 
structure of any of these species or 
stocks that would lead to a different 
analysis for this activity. 
Level A harassment is extremely 
unlikely given the small size of the 
Level A harassment isopleths and the 
required mitigation measures designed 
to minimize the possibility of injury to 
marine mammals. No serious injury or 
mortality is anticipated given the nature 
of the activity. 
Pile driving activities have the 
potential to disturb or displace marine 
mammals. Specifically, the project 
activities may result in take, in the form 
of Level B harassment from underwater 
sounds generated from impact and 
vibratory pile driving activities. 
Potential takes could occur if 
individuals move into the ensonified 
zones when these activities are 
underway. 
The takes by Level B harassment 
would be due to potential behavioral 
disturbances. The potential for 
harassment is minimized through 
construction methods and the 
implementation of planned mitigation 
strategies (see Proposed Mitigation 
section). 
Behavioral responses of marine 
mammals to pile driving at the project 
site, if any, are expected to be mild and 
temporary. Marine mammals within the 
Level B harassment zone may not show 
any visual cues they are disturbed by 
activities or could become alert, avoid 
the area, leave the area, or display other 
mild responses that are not observable 
such as changes in vocalization 
patterns. Given the short duration of 
noise-generating activities per day and 
that pile driving and removal would 
occur over approximately 62 days 
during a span of 5 months, any 
harassment would be temporary. There 
are no other areas or times of known 
biological importance for any of the 
affected species. 
Take would occur within a limited, 
confined area of each stock’s range. 
Further, the amount of take authorized 
is extremely small when compared to 
stock abundance. 
No marine mammal stocks for which 
incidental take authorization is 
proposed are listed as threatened or 
endangered under the ESA. Only one 
stock, the Eastern North Pacific Stock of 
the northern fur seal, is listed as 
depleted under the MMPA. However, 
we do not expect the proposed 
authorizations in this action to affect the 
stock. No injury or mortality is proposed 
for authorization, take by Level B 
harassment is limited (five takes over 
the duration of the project), and the 
proposed action should have no effect 
on the reproduction of this species. In 
addition, the five authorized takes for 
the northern fur seal include both the 
depleted Eastern North Pacific Stock 
and the California stock, which is not 
depleted. 
The relatively low marine mammal 
occurrences in the area, shutdown 
zones, and planned monitoring make

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60649 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices injury of marine mammals unlikely. The 
shutdown zones would be thoroughly 
monitored before the pile driving 
activities begin, and activities would be 
postponed if a marine mammal is 
sighted within the shutdown zone. 
There is a high likelihood that marine 
mammals would be detected by trained 
observers under environmental 
conditions described for the project. 
Limiting pile driving activities to 
daylight hours would also increase 
detectability of marine mammals in the 
area. Therefore, the mitigation and 
monitoring measures are expected to 
eliminate the potential for injury and 
Level A harassment as well as reduce 
the amount and intensity of Level B 
behavioral harassment. Furthermore, the 
pile driving activities analyzed here are 
similar to, or less impactful than, 
numerous construction activities 
conducted in other similar locations 
which have occurred with no reported 
injuries or mortality to marine 
mammals, and no known long-term 
adverse consequences from behavioral 
harassment. 
The project is not expected to have 
significant adverse effects on marine 
mammal habitat. There are no known 
Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) or 
ESA-designated critical habitat within 
the project area, and the activities 
would not permanently modify existing 
marine mammal habitat. 
In summary and as described above, 
the following factors primarily support 
our preliminary determination that the 
impacts resulting from this activity are 
not expected to adversely affect any of 
the species or stocks through effects on 
annual rates of recruitment or survival: 
€No serious injury or mortality is anticipated or authorized; 
€The specified activities and associated ensonified areas are very 
small relative to the overall habitat 
ranges of all species; 
€The project area does not overlap known BIAs or ESA-designated critical 
habitat; 
€The lack of anticipated significant or long-term effects or marine mammal 
habitat; and 
€The presumed efficacy of the mitigation measures in reducing the 
effects of the specified activity. 
Based on the analysis contained 
herein of the likely effects of the 
specified activity on marine mammals 
and their habitat, and taking into 
consideration the implementation of the 
proposed monitoring and mitigation 
measures, NMFS preliminarily finds 
that the total marine mammal take from 
the proposed activity will have a 
negligible impact on all affected marine 
mammal species or stocks. 
Small Numbers 
As noted previously, only take of 
small numbers of marine mammals may 
be authorized under section 101(a)(5)(A) 
and (D) of the MMPA for specified 
activities other than military readiness 
activities. The MMPA does not define 
small numbers and so, in practice, 
where estimated numbers are available, 
NMFS compares the number of 
individuals taken to the most 
appropriate estimation of abundance of 
the relevant species or stock in our 
determination of whether an 
authorization is limited to small 
numbers of marine mammals. When the 
predicted number of individuals to be 
taken is fewer than one-third of the 
species or stock abundance, the take is 
considered to be of small numbers (see 
86 FR 5322, January 19, 2021). 
Additionally, other qualitative factors 
may be considered in the analysis, such 
as the temporal or spatial scale of the 
activities. 
The amount of take NMFS proposes to 
authorize is below one-third of the 
estimated stock abundances for all 
stocks (table 9). These are all likely 
conservative estimates because they 
assume all takes are of different 
individual animals which is likely not 
the case. Some individuals may return 
multiple times in a day, but PSOs would 
count them as separate takes if they 
cannot be individually identified. 
Based on the analysis contained 
herein of the proposed activity 
(including the proposed mitigation and 
monitoring measures) and the 
anticipated take of marine mammals, 
NMFS preliminarily finds that small 
numbers of marine mammals would be 
taken relative to the population size of 
the affected species or stocks. 
Unmitigable Adverse Impact Analysis 
and Determination 
There are no relevant subsistence uses 
of the affected marine mammal stocks or 
species implicated by this action. 
Therefore, NMFS has determined that 
the total taking of affected species or 
stocks would not have an unmitigable 
adverse impact on the availability of 
such species or stocks for taking for 
subsistence purposes. 
Endangered Species Act 
Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA of 1973 (16 
U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) requires that each 
Federal agency ensures that any action 
it authorizes, funds, or carries out is not 
likely to jeopardize the continued 
existence of any endangered or 
threatened species or result in the 
destruction or adverse modification of 
designated critical habitat. To ensure 
ESA compliance for the issuance of 
ITAs, NMFS consults internally 
whenever we propose to authorize take 
for ESA-listed species. 
No incidental take of ESA-listed 
species is proposed for authorization or 
expected to result from this activity. 
Therefore, NMFS has determined that 
formal consultation under section 7 of 
the ESA is not required for this action. 
Proposed Authorization 
As a result of these preliminary 
determinations, NMFS proposes to issue 
an IHA to PG&E for conducting pile 
driving activities in San Francisco Bay, 
provided the previously mentioned 
mitigation, monitoring, and reporting 
requirements are incorporated. A draft 
of the proposed IHA can be found at: 
https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/ 
national/marine-mammal-protection/

construction-activities.

the proposed authorization, and any 
other aspect of this notice of proposed 
IHA for the proposed construction. We

renewal of this proposed IHA as 
described in the paragraph below. 
Please include with your comments any 
supporting data or literature citations to

AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 
Commerce. 
ACTION: Notice of issuance of letter of authorization. 
SUMMARY: In accordance with the Marine Mammal Protection Act 
(MMPA), as amended, its implementing 
regulations, and NMFS’ MMPA 
regulations for taking marine mammals 
incidental to geophysical surveys 
related to oil and gas activities in the 
Gulf of America (GOA), originally 
published as ‘‘Taking Marine Mammals 
Incidental to Geophysical Surveys 
Related to Oil and Gas Activities in the 
Gulf of Mexico,’’ notification is hereby 
given that NMFS has modified the 
Letter of Authorization (LOA) issued to 
TGS for the taking of marine mammals 
incidental to geophysical survey activity 
in the GOA. 
DATES: This LOA is effective through April 19, 2026.

Resources, NMFS, (301) 427–8401. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
Section 101(a)(5)(A) and (D) of the 
MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) direct 
the Secretary of Commerce to allow, 
upon request, the incidental, but not 
intentional, taking of small numbers of 
marine mammals by U.S. citizens who 
engage in a specified activity (other than 
commercial fishing) within a specified 
geographical region if certain findings 
are made and either regulations are 
issued or, if the taking is limited to 
harassment, a notice of a proposed 
authorization is provided to the public 
for review. 
An authorization for incidental 
takings shall be granted if NMFS finds 
that the taking will have a negligible 
impact on the species or stock(s), will 
not have an unmitigable adverse impact 
on the availability of the species or 
stock(s) for subsistence uses (where 
relevant), and if the permissible 
methods of taking and requirements 
pertaining to the mitigation, monitoring 
and reporting of such takings are set 
forth. NMFS has defined ‘‘negligible 
impact’’ in 50 CFR 216.103 as an impact 
resulting from the specified activity that 
cannot be reasonably expected to, and is 
not reasonably likely to, adversely affect 
the species or stock through effects on 
annual rates of recruitment or survival. 
Except with respect to certain 
activities not pertinent here, the MMPA 
defines ‘‘harassment’’ as: any act of 
pursuit, torment, or annoyance which: 
(i) has the potential to injure a marine 
mammal or marine mammal stock in the 
wild (Level A harassment); or (ii) has 
the potential to disturb a marine 
mammal or marine mammal stock in the 
wild by causing disruption of behavioral 
patterns, including, but not limited to, 
migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, 
feeding, or sheltering (Level B 
harassment). 
On January 19, 2021, we issued a final 
rule with regulations to govern the 
unintentional taking of marine 
mammals incidental to geophysical 
survey activities conducted by oil and 
gas industry operators, and those 
persons authorized to conduct activities 
on their behalf (collectively ‘‘industry 
operators’’), in U.S. waters of the (Gulf 
of America) GOA
1
over the course of 5 
years (86 FR 5322, January 19, 2021). 
The rule was based on our findings that 
the total taking from the specified 
activities over the 5-year period will 
have a negligible impact on the affected 
species or stock(s) of marine mammals 
and will not have an unmitigable 
adverse impact on the availability of 
those species or stocks for subsistence 
uses. The rule became effective on April 
19, 2021. 
The regulations at 50 CFR 217.180 et 
seq. allow for the issuance of LOAs to industry operators for the incidental 
take of marine mammals during 
geophysical survey activities and 
prescribe the permissible methods of 
taking and other means of effecting the 
least practicable adverse impact on 
marine mammal species or stocks and 
their habitat (often referred to as 
mitigation), as well as requirements 
pertaining to the monitoring and 
reporting of such taking. Under 50 CFR 
217.186(e), issuance of an LOA shall be 
based on a determination that the level 
of taking will be consistent with the 
findings made for the total taking 
allowable under these regulations and a 
determination that the amount of take 
authorized under the LOA is of no more 
than small numbers. 
NMFS subsequently discovered that 
the 2021 rule was based on erroneous 
take estimates. We conducted another 
rulemaking using correct take estimates 
and other newly available and pertinent 
information relevant to the analyses 
supporting some of the findings in the 
2021 final rule and the taking allowable 
under the regulations. We issued a final 
rule in April 2024, effective May 24, 
2024 (89 FR 31488, April 24, 2024). 
The 2024 final rule made no changes 
to the specified activities or the 
specified geographical region in which 
those activities would be conducted, nor 
to the original 5-year period of 
effectiveness. In consideration of the 
new information, the 2024 rule 
presented new analyses supporting 
affirmance of the negligible impact 
determinations for all species, and 
affirmed that the existing regulations, 
which contain mitigation, monitoring, 
and reporting requirements, are 
consistent with the least practicable 
adverse impact (LPAI) standard of the 
MMPA. 
NMFS issued a LOA to TGS on 
December 20, 2024, for the take of 
marine mammals incidental to a three- 
dimensional (3D) ocean bottom node 
survey in the East Breaks area, effective 
December 20, 2024, through December 
19, 2025. Please see the Federal Register 
notice of issuance (89 FR 105536, 
December 27, 2024) for additional detail 
regarding the LOA and the survey 
activity. 
On July 22, 2025, TGS informed 
NMFS that its planned survey area and 
timing had shifted and, accordingly, 
they requested a modification to the 
LOA to reflect the new survey area and 
dates. No survey activity had begun. 
TGS requested the expiration date be 
extended to April 19, 2026, and increase 
the survey to 105 total days of sound 
source operation in Zone 6. On August 
19, 2025, NMFS issued a modified LOA 
to TGS (90 FR 41060; August 22, 2025). 
On November 26, 2025, TGS notified 
NMFS that the survey area had changed 
again based on market interest. TGS is 
now requesting 140 total days of sound 
source operation with 139 days in zone 
6 and 1 day in zone 7. The monthly

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60652 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices distribution of survey days is not known 
in advance, though we assume that the 
planned 140 days of source operation 
would occur contiguously. Take 
estimates for each species are based on 
the time period that produces the 
greatest value and have been updated 
based on the revised survey plan. There 
are no other changes to the planned 
survey. 
For the Rice’s whale, recent survey 
data, sightings, and acoustic data 
support Rice’s whale occurrence in 
waters throughout the GOA between 
approximately 100 meters (m) and 400 
m depth along the continental shelf 
break, and associated habitat-based 
density modeling has identified similar 
habitat (i.e., approximately 100 to 400 m water depths along the continental shelf 
break) as being Rice’s whale habitat 
(Garrison et al., 2023; Soldevilla et al., 2022, 2024). NMFS’ 2024 final rule 
provided detailed discussion regarding 
Rice’s whale habitat (see, e.g., 89 FR 31508, 31519). 
TGS’s planned activities will overlap 
with this depth range, with 
approximately 10 percent of the area 
expected to be ensonified by the survey 
above root-mean-squared pressure 
received levels (RMS SPL) of 160 
decibel (dB) (referenced to 1 
micropascal (re 1 mPa)) overlapping the 
100–400 m isobaths. Therefore, there is 
some reasonable potential for take of 
Rice’s whale to occur in association 
with this survey. The generic acoustic 
exposure modeling results in one take of 
Rice’s whales and we have rounded that 
up to a group size, authorizing two 
Rice’s whale takes. 
Based on the results of our analysis, 
NMFS has determined that the level of 
taking expected for this survey and 
authorized through the LOA is 
consistent with the findings made for 
the total taking allowable under the 
regulations. See table 1 in this notice 
and table 6 of the rule (89 FR 31488, 
April 24, 2024). 
Small Numbers Determination 
Under the rule, NMFS may not 
authorize incidental take of marine 
mammals in an LOA if it will exceed 
‘‘small numbers.’’ In short, when an 
acceptable estimate of the individual 
marine mammals taken is available, if 
the estimated number of individual 
animals taken is up to, but not greater 
than, one-third of the best available 
abundance estimate, NMFS will 
determine that the numbers of marine 
mammals taken of a species or stock are 
small (see 89 FR 31535, May 24, 2024). 
For more information please see NMFS’ 
discussion of small numbers in the 2021 
final rule (86 FR 5438, January 19, 
2021). 
The take numbers for authorization 
are determined as described above and 
in the Federal Register notice of 
issuances (90 FR 41060, August 22, 
2025; 89 FR 105536, December 27, 
2024). Subsequently, the total incidents 
of harassment for each species are 
multiplied by scalar ratios (except in the 
cases where the take estimate has been 
rounded up to reflect a group size) to 
produce a derived product that better 
reflects the number of individuals likely 
to be taken within a survey (as 
compared to the total number of 
instances of take), accounting for the 
likelihood that some individual marine 
mammals may be taken on more than 1 
day (see 86 FR 5404, January 19, 2021). 
The output of this scaling, where 
appropriate, is incorporated into 
adjusted total take estimates that are the 
basis for NMFS’ small numbers 
determinations, as depicted in table 1. 
This product is used by NMFS in 
making the necessary small numbers 
determinations through comparison 
with the best available abundance 
estimates (see discussion at 86 FR 5391, 
January 19, 2021). For this comparison, 
NMFS’ approach is to use the maximum 
theoretical population, determined 
through review of current stock 
assessment reports (SAR; https://
www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/ 
marine-mammal-protection/marine- 
mammal-stock-assessments) and model- 
predicted abundance information 
(https://seamap.env.duke.edu/models/ 
Duke/GOM/). Information supporting 
the small numbers determinations is 
provided in table 1.

herein of TGS’s proposed survey 
activity described in its LOA 
application, as subsequently modified 
by TGS, and the anticipated take of 
marine mammals, NMFS finds that 
small numbers of marine mammals will 
be taken relative to the affected species 
or stock sizes (i.e., less than one-third of the best available abundance estimate) 
and therefore the taking is of no more 
than small numbers. 
Authorization 
NMFS has determined that the level 
of taking for this LOA request is 
consistent with the findings made for 
the total taking allowable under the 
incidental take regulations and that the 
amount of take authorized under the 
LOA is of no more than small numbers. 
Accordingly, we have issued a 
modification to the LOA to TGS 
authorizing the take of marine mammals 
incidental to its geophysical survey 
activity, as described above.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
The MMPA prohibits the ‘‘take’’ of 
marine mammals, with certain 
exceptions. Section 101(a)(5)(A) and (D) 
of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) 
directs the Secretary of Commerce (as 
delegated to NMFS) to allow, upon 
request, the incidental, but not 
intentional, taking of small numbers of 
marine mammals by U.S. citizens who 
engage in a specified activity (other than 
commercial fishing) within a specified 
geographical region if certain findings 
are made and either regulations are 
proposed or, if the taking is limited to 
harassment, a notice of a proposed IHA 
is provided to the public for review. 
Authorization for incidental takings 
shall be granted if NMFS finds that the 
taking will have a negligible impact on 
the species or stock(s) and will not have 
an unmitigable adverse impact on the 
availability of the species or stock(s) for 
taking for subsistence uses (where 
relevant). Further, NMFS must prescribe 
the permissible methods of taking and 
other ‘‘means of effecting the least 
practicable adverse impact’’ on the 
affected species or stocks and their 
habitat, paying particular attention to 
rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of 
similar significance, and on the 
availability of the species or stocks for 
taking for certain subsistence uses 
(collectively referred to as ‘‘mitigation’’); 
and requirements pertaining to the 
monitoring and reporting of the takings. 
The definitions of all applicable MMPA 
statutory terms used above are included 
in the relevant sections below and can 
be found in section 3 of the MMPA (16 
U.S.C. 1362) and NMFS regulations at 
50 CFR 216.103. 
National Environmental Policy Act 
To comply with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(NEPA; 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and 
NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 
216–6A, NMFS must review our 
proposed action (i.e., the issuance of an IHA) with respect to potential impacts 
on the human environment. 
This action is consistent with 
categories of activities identified in 
Categorical Exclusion B4 (IHAs with no 
anticipated serious injury or mortality) 
of the Companion Manual for NAO 216– 
6A, which do not individually or 
cumulatively have the potential for 
significant impacts on the quality of the 
human environment and for which we 
have not identified any extraordinary 
circumstances that would preclude this 
categorical exclusion. Accordingly, 
NMFS has preliminarily determined 
that the issuance of the proposed IHA 
qualifies to be categorically excluded 
from further NEPA review. 
Summary of Request 
On July 30, 2025, NMFS received a 
request from ADOT&PF for an IHA to 
take marine mammals incidental to pile- 
driving activities for the Cold Bay Ferry 
Terminal Reconstruction Project in Cold 
Bay, Alaska. Following NMFS’ review of 
the application, ADOT&PF submitted 
revised versions on November 14, 2025, 
November 21, 2025, December 11, 2025, 
and December 19, 2025. The application 
was deemed adequate and complete on

is for take of six species (eight stocks) 
of marine mammals by Level B 
harassment and, for a subset of these 
species, Level A harassment. Neither 
ADOT&PF nor NMFS expect serious 
injury or mortality to result from this 
activity and, therefore, an IHA is 
appropriate. 
NMFS previously issued several IHAs 
to ADOT&PF for similar coastal 
construction work between 2018 and 
2025 (e.g., 83 FR 5063, February 5, 2018; 83 FR 29749, June 26, 2018; July 19, 
2023, 88 FR 46145; 90 FR 24385, June 
10, 2025; 90 FR 38134, August 7, 2025). 
To date, ADOT&PF has complied with 
all the requirements (e.g., mitigation, monitoring, and reporting) of the 
previous IHAs. 
Description of Proposed Activity 
Overview 
ADOT&PF has requested an IHA to 
take marine mammals incidental to in- 
water construction activities. The 
original Cold Bay Dock was constructed 
by the State of Alaska in 1978, 
expanded in 1993, and then refurbished 
in 2015. Currently, the structure is 
nearing the end of serviceable life and 
is at risk of failing, which would be 
detrimental for the communities that so 
heavily rely on this infrastructure. At 
present, use restrictions are currently in 
place that limit axel loads and gross 
vehicle weights until the dock can be 
fully replaced. Given the receipt of 
additional funding, ADOT&PF plans to 
replace the aging public dock to 
improve accessibility; support 
commercial, subsistence, and recreation 
users; continue uninterrupted ferry 
service; secure cargo delivery and bulk 
materials offloading; ensure public 
safety; and safeguard vessel moorage. 
Additionally, this project would 
maintain access to essential services for 
surrounding communities that rely on 
Cold Bay as a hub for fuel, goods, cargo, 
and potable drinking water. The new 
dock would be designed and built to 
accommodate commercial use, freight 
and fuel transportation, private vessel 
use, and public uses like emergency 
medical services and public 
transportation through the Alaska 
Marine Highway System (AMHS). 
Given the proposed use of vibratory 
and impact pile driving to remove and 
install piles, there is potential of the 
take of marine mammals by Level B 
harassment and, for a subset of the 
species, Level A harassment. No serious 
injury and/or mortality is expected or 
proposed for this project. 
Dates and Duration 
ADOT&PF has been awarded funds by 
the U.S. Department of Transportation’s 
(DOT) Maritime Administration 
(MARAD) under the Port Infrastructure 
Development Program (via the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
(Pub. L. 117–58, November 15, 2021)), a 
discretionary grant program awarded on 
a competitive basis to projects that 
improve the safety, efficiency, or 
reliability of the movement of goods 
into, out of, around, or within a port 
(https://www.maritime.dot.gov/ 
PIDPgrants). These grants are awarded 
to improve port and related freight 
infrastructure to meet the nation’s 
freight transport needs and ensure that 
port infrastructure can keep up with the 
growth of freight volume as it continues 
to increase. 
ADOT&PF intends to begin their 
project on May 1, 2028, and continue for 
one year through April 30, 2029. The 
entire project is anticipated to consist of 
18 months of activities (in-water and on- 
shore), whereas the in-water activities 
(i.e., pile driving) are expected to occur for 12 months, consisting of 231 (not 
necessarily consecutive) days requiring 
10 to 12 hours of activities per day, 
following the general schedule of events 
described in table 1. In-water pile 
driving is expected to occur near- 
continuously for the first 7 months (May 
through November with an estimated 
driving duration of 165 days), which 
would allow for the installation of the 
trestle and dock piles. For the next 3 
months (December through February), 
limited in-water pile driving is expected 
to occur as the dock superstructure is 
completed. Likely activities during 
these months include fender and 
dolphin installation (estimated 21 days 
of in-water pile driving). After this is 
completed, demolition activities on the 
existing dock would be performed, 
estimated to require non-continuous in- 
water pile driving over approximately 
45 days within a 2-month period (March 
to April).

Installation of the trestle would likely progress from shore, seaward to the dock location. 
However, project delays may occur 
due to a number of factors, including 
other permitting requirements, 
availability of equipment and/or 
materials, weather-related delays, 
equipment maintenance and/or repair, 
transit to and from ports to survey 
locations, and other contingencies. 
Therefore, the analysis herein represents 
a best estimate of activities and 
timeframe and does not imply limits to 
activities in a given month. 
Specific Geographic Region 
The proposed project is located 
within southwestern tip of the Alaska 
Peninsula (Township 57 South, Range 
89 West of the Seward Meridian; U.S. 
Geological Survey Quadrangle COLD 
BAY A–3) (see figure 1). Situated at 
approximately Latitude 55°12 N, Longitude 162°42 W, the city encompasses 53.41 square miles (mi
2
; 
138 square kilometers (km
2
)) of land 
and 14.64 mi
2
(38 km
2
) of water. Per the 
United States 2020 census, 
approximately 50 people live within 
Cold Bay (U.S. Census Bureau, 2025). 
The City of Cold Bay sits approximately 
138 feet (ft; 42 meters (m)) above mean 
sea level. 
Geologically, the region is part of the 
Aleutian arc, a highly active segment of 
the Pacific Ring of Fire. The landscape 
is dominated by prominent volcanic 
features, including Frosty Peak and 
Mount Simeon nearby, with the more 
distant and active Pavlof and Shishaldin 
Volcanoes. The region contains complex 
geology, which is shaped by a long 
history of volcanic, glacial, and tectonic 
processes. The immediate topography of 
Cold Bay is characterized by a rolling, 
treeless tundra dotted with numerous 
lakes and swamps. This landscape is 
part of a broad coastal lowland on the 
northern side of the peninsula, which 
generally lies less than 100 ft (30.5 m) 
above sea level. Cold Bay’s most 
defining physical characteristic is its 
location on a narrow isthmus separating 
two great marine ecosystems: the cold, 
shallow, and enclosed Bering Sea to the 
north, and the deep, warmer, and open 
North Pacific Ocean to the south. This 
unique geographical position creates a 
convergence zone of powerful ocean 
currents, temperature gradients, and 
salinities, resulting in one of the most 
biologically productive marine 
environments on the planet. The City of 
Cold Bay lies on the shore of Cold Bay, 
a large Pacific Ocean embayment, and is 
adjacent to the Izembek Lagoon (a 
shallow, 30-mi (48-km) coastal 
ecosystem that contains one of the 
world’s largest beds of eelgrass (Zostera 
marina) (Rice and Hogan, 1995)) on the 
Bering Sea side. 
Cold Bay serves as a primary 
commercial and transportation hub for 
the Alaska Peninsula and a gateway to 
the Aleutian Islands. It is the 
headquarters for the Izembek National 
Wildlife Refuge (see U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service (2025a)) and a key 
logistics and support center for the 
commercial fishing industry in the 
region. The city’s primary infrastructure 
includes the Port of Cold Bay, which 
serves the state ferry system, and the 
Cold Bay Airport, a critical regional hub 
and emergency diversion airport for 
trans-Pacific flights with one of the 
longest runways in Alaska.

Detailed Description of the Specified 
Activity 
ADOT&PF has proposed to remove 
components of the existing and aging 
structure and install new components to 
better serve the Cold Bay community. 
The existing Cold Bay Dock is a critical 
facility for the community and 
surrounding areas, serving as the sole 
location for the sea-based delivery of 
fuel, goods, cargo, and potable drinking 
water. Per the 2022–2027 Alaska 
Statewide Comprehensive Economic 
Development Strategy, officials have 
highlighted that coastal communities, 
such as Cold Bay, depend on efficient 
and well-functioning waterfront 
infrastructure to receive goods. 
Currently, the dock is nearing the end 
of its serviceable life and is at risk of 
failing. Use restrictions are in place that 
limit axle loads and gross vehicle 
weights until the dock can be replaced. 
The new dock would be designed and 
built to accommodate a variety of uses, 
including commercial use, freight and 
fuel transportation, private vessel uses, 
and public uses like emergency medical 
services and public transportation 
through the AMHS. 
The project would be completed in 
stages, depending on the structure being 
constructed, including development of a 
trestle and abutment, a dock, dolphin 
piles, and then demolition/removal of 
old structures (i.e., trestle, dock, dolphins, and fenders). For all in-water 
work, the project would require the 
mobilization of barges and support 
vessels, all of which are likely to come 
from different communities within 
Alaska. The number of vessels is not 
currently known as the construction 
contractor has not been chosen but all 
support vessels, support barges, material 
barges, and construction barges would 
follow known routes when transiting to 
the construction site. 
To develop the new infrastructure, a 
360 ft (109.7 m) by 54 ft (16.5 m) pile- 
supported dock with adjacent mooring 
dolphins would be developed. The 
applicant would also develop fendering 
(both heavy-duty on the primary face 
and light-duty fenders on opposite 
faces) around the new dock. All access 
to the dock would be made available by 
a 22 ft (6.7 m) by 1,800 ft (548.6 m) pile- 
supported trestle. The trestle and dock 
would be constructed using pre-cast 
concrete elements, supported by pile- 
driven steel foundation piles. For the 
trestle and dock construction, vibratory 
pile driving would be used whenever 
feasible, but impact pile driving likely 
would be needed to proof piles. The 
trestle would be constructed using 
prefabricated sections supported by pile 
bents. A pile-supported abutment would 
support the nearshore end of the trestle. 
All pier-support piles would be 
installed first, followed by the pre-cast 
concrete caps, and then the 
superstructure would be set. The trestle 
piles would require both vibratory and 
impact pile driving methods, to install 
and (in some cases remove) a total of 
208 temporary piles, 261 new 
permanent piles, and 322 existing piles. 
No simultaneous pile driving is 
planned. Pile specifics for the dock 
trestle are described here: 
€Vibratory and impact installation of 113 permanent trestle support piles (36- 
inch (in); 91.44-centimeter (cm) pipe 
piles); 
€Vibratory and impact installation and vibratory removal of 150 temporary 
trestle piles (24-in (60.96-cm) to 36-in 
(91.44-cm) pipe or H-piles); 
€Vibratory and impact installation of 80 permanent dock support piles (36-in 
(91.44-cm) pipe piles);

dock piles (24-in (60.96-cm) to 36-in 
(91.44-cm) pipe piles); 
€Vibratory installation of 20 fender piles (30-in (76.2-cm) pipe piles); and 
€Vibratory installation of 40 fender piles (24-in (60.96-cm) pipe piles). 
The construction of the dock would 
proceed similarly to trestle construction, 
where the dock piles would be installed 
using both vibratory and impact 
methods. All permanent piles would be 
driven at their pre-planned locations, 
which would be followed by a setting of 
pre-cast concrete caps and structural 
panel systems that make up the 
superstructure of the dock. Piles would 
be set and driven using a crane either 
located on a barge or working on a 
temporary structure. Fenders (using two 
fender piles) would be installed along 
the offshore dock face to protect the 
dock from moored vessels. Single pile 
fenders would be installed on the 
shoreward dock face. Installation would 
only be by vibratory pile driving. Lastly, 
various dock appurtenances and 
utilities would be installed, although 
these would not necessitate any pile 
driving. These would serve the current 
and future needs of the dock and consist 
of water, electrical, and fuel piping, 
such as the installation of utility lines 
and diesel/gasoline fuel lines, a portable 
water supply line, and new lighting 
along the new trestle and dock. 
Upon completion of the dock and 
trestle structures, the applicant would 
install two dolphins at opposite ends, 
using four temporary pile templates 
initially driven for the installation of 
each dolphin and removed following 
completion. Temporary piles would be 
installed using vibratory pile driving, 
and impact pile driving would be used 
to proof the vertical load supporting 
piles or in the case of obstructions. All 
temporary piles would be extracted 
using vibratory pile driving. Pile 
specifics for the dolphins are described 
here: 
€Vibratory and impact installation of eight permanent dolphin piles (36-in 
(76.2-cm) pipe piles); and 
€Vibratory installation and removal of eight temporary dolphin piles (24-in 
(60.96-cm) to 36-in (76.2-cm) pipe 
piles). 
During all the construction, 
demolition and removal of the existing 
older dock structure would be 
coordinated with the installation of the 
new structure to minimize any potential 
disturbance to users of the facility. 
Trestle demolition would not be 
performed until the new trestle is 
completed. Demolition for the dock and 
trestle would include removal of the 
concrete superstructure, support piles, 
fenders and all dock utilities and 
appurtenances. Removal of the 
superstructure would be accomplished 
by first saw-cutting and pulling the 
concrete deck panels. The existing pile 
caps would then be cut, while the 
supporting piles would be cut at the 
pile/cap interface and then the caps 
would be lifted and removed. Pile 
extraction would proceed following the 
removal of the superstructure. All piles 
would be removed using vibratory pile 
driving equipment or cut off at the 
mudline. Piles removed during 
demolition would include: 
€180 trestle piles (16-in (40.64-cm) pipe piles); 
€24 dock piles (16-in (40.64-cm) pipe piles); 
€65 dock piles (26-in (66-cm) pipe piles); 
€9 dolphin piles (16-in (40.64-cm) pipe piles); 
€13 fender piles (20-in (50.8-cm) pipe piles); and 
€31 fender piles (16-in (40.64-cm) timber piles). 
Upon completion, refuse and excess 
materials from the project would be 
either reclaimed, recycled, or disposed 
of and all project equipment would be 
demobilized to the port of origin. 
A summary of all piles planned to be 
installed or removed and their specific 
attributes are included in table 2 below.

Description of Marine Mammals in the 
Area of Specified Activities 
Sections 3 and 4 of the application 
summarize available information 
regarding status and trends, distribution 
and habitat preferences, and behavior 
and life history of the potentially 
affected species. NMFS fully considered 
all of this information, and we refer the 
reader to these descriptions, instead of 
reprinting the information. Additional 
information regarding population trends 
and threats may be found in NMFS’ 
Stock Assessment Reports (SARs; 
https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/ 
national/marine-mammal-protection/ 
marine-mammal-stock-assessments) 
and more general information about 
these species (e.g., physical and behavioral descriptions) may be found 
on NMFS’ website (https://
www.fisheries.noaa.gov/find-species). 
Table 3 lists all species or stocks for 
which take is expected and proposed to 
be authorized for this activity and 
summarizes information related to the 
population or stock, including 
regulatory status under the MMPA and 
Endangered Species Act (ESA) and 
potential biological removal (PBR), 
where known. PBR is defined by the 
MMPA as the maximum number of 
animals, not including natural 
mortalities, that may be removed from a 
marine mammal stock while allowing 
that stock to reach or maintain its 
optimum sustainable population (as 
described in NMFS’ SARs). While no 
serious injury or mortality is anticipated 
or proposed to be authorized here, PBR 
and annual serious injury and mortality 
(M/SI) from anthropogenic sources are 
included here as gross indicators of the 
status of the species or stocks and other 
threats. 
Marine mammal abundance estimates 
presented in this document represent 
the total number of individuals that 
make up a given stock or the total 
number estimated within a particular 
study or survey area. NMFS’ stock 
abundance estimates for most species 
represent the total estimate of 
individuals within the geographic area, 
if known, that comprises that stock. For 
some species, this geographic area may 
extend beyond U.S. waters. All managed 
stocks in this region are assessed in 
NMFS’ Alaska SARs. All values 
presented in table 3 are the most recent 
available at the time of publication 
(including from the draft 2024 SARs) 
and are available online at: https://

As indicated above, all six species 
(with eight managed stocks) in table 3 
temporally and spatially co-occur with 
the activity to the degree that take is 
reasonably likely to occur. 
For all marine mammal species, there 
are no known biologically important 
areas (BIA) within the coastal site that 
ADOT&PF’s proposed activities would 
be expected to impact. For fin whales 
(Balaenoptera physalus), gray whales, 
humpback whales, North Pacific right 
whales (Eubalaena japonica), and sperm 
whales (Physeter macrocephalus), while 
these have been sighted near Cold Bay 
historically or could be encountered 
along anticipated vessel transit routes, 
these are not expected within the Bay 
itself, where the construction would be 
occurring and acoustic disturbance 
could occur, given its relatively shallow 
depths. Furthermore, any feeding or 
migratory BIAs exist outside of the 
project area in more offshore areas 
(Brower et al., 2022). Given the inshore and sheltered nature of the project, 
NMFS does not expect that any acoustic 
influence would transmit outside of 
Cold Bay. Furthermore, the area where 
the proposed project would occur 
represents a small portion of the 
available habitat for these species. 
In addition, northern sea otters may 
(Enhydra lutris kenyonii) be found in 
Cold Bay (Alaska Department of Fish 
and Game, 2025). However, this species 
and its stocks are managed by the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service and are not 
considered further in this notice. 
Marine Mammal Hearing 
Hearing is the most important sensory 
modality for marine mammals 
underwater, and exposure to 
anthropogenic sound can have 
deleterious effects. To appropriately 
assess the potential effects of exposure 
to sound, it is necessary to understand 
the frequency ranges marine mammals 
are able to hear. Not all marine mammal 
species have equal hearing capabilities 
or hear over the same frequency range 
(e.g., Richardson et al., 1995; Wartzok and Ketten, 1999; Au and Hastings, 
2008). To reflect this, Southall et al. 
(2007, 2019) recommended that marine 
mammals be divided into hearing 
groups based on directly measured 
(behavioral or auditory evoked potential 
techniques) or estimated hearing ranges 
(behavioral response data, anatomical 
modeling, etc.). Generalized hearing ranges were chosen based on the 65 
decibel (dB) threshold from composite 
audiograms, previous analyses in NMFS 
(2018), and/or data from Southall et al. 
(2007) and Southall et al. (2019). We 
note that the names of two hearing 
groups and the generalized hearing 
ranges of all marine mammal hearing 
groups have been recently updated 
(NMFS, 2024) as reflected below in table 
4.

Additionally, animals are able to detect very loud sounds 
above and below that ‘‘generalized’’ hearing range. 
Of the species potentially present in 
the action area, two are considered low- 
frequency (LF) cetaceans (i.e., gray whales and humpback whales), one is 
considered a high-frequency (HF) 
cetacean (i.e., killer whale), one is considered a very high-frequency (VHF) 
cetacean (i.e., harbor porpoise), one is an otariid pinniped (i.e., Steller sea lion), and one is a phocid pinniped (i.e., 
harbor seal).

groups and associated frequency ranges,

Potential Effects of Specified Activities 
on Marine Mammals and Their Habitat 
This section includes a summary and 
provides a discussion of the ways in 
which components of the specified 
activity may impact marine mammals 
and their habitat. The Estimated Take of 
Marine Mammals section later in this 
document includes a quantitative 
analysis of the number of individuals 
that are expected to be taken by this 
activity. The Negligible Impact Analysis 
and Determination section considers the 
content of this section, the Estimated 
Take of Marine Mammals section, and 
the Proposed Mitigation section, to draw 
conclusions regarding the likely impacts 
of these activities on the reproductive 
success or survivorship of individuals 
and whether those impacts are 
reasonably expected to, or reasonably 
likely to, adversely affect the species or 
stock through effects on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival. 
Acoustic effects on marine mammals 
during the specified activity are 
expected to potentially occur from 
impact and vibratory pile installation 
and removal. The effects of underwater 
noise from ADOT&PF’s proposed 
activities have the potential to result in 
Level B harassment of marine mammals 
in the action area and, for some species 
as a result of certain activities, Level A 
harassment.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60660 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices Overall, the proposed activities 
include the removal and installation of 
old, temporary, and permanent piles in 
Cold Bay, Alaska. There are a variety of 
types and degrees of effects to marine 
mammals, prey species, and habitat that 
could occur as a result of the project. 
Below we provide a brief description of 
the types of sound sources that would 
be generated by the project, the general 
impacts from these types of activities, 
and an analysis of the anticipated 
impacts on marine mammals from the 
project, with consideration of the 
proposed mitigation measures. 
Description of Sound Sources for the 
Specified Activities 
Activities associated with the project 
that have the potential to incidentally 
take marine mammals though exposure 
to sound would include impact pile 
driving for installation, and vibratory 
pile driving for installation and 
removal. Impact hammers typically 
operate by repeatedly dropping and/or 
pushing a heavy piston onto a pile to 
drive the pile into the substrate. Sound 
generated by impact hammers is 
impulsive, characterized by rapid rise 
times and high peak levels, a potentially 
injurious combination (Hastings and 
Popper, 2005). Vibratory hammers 
install piles by vibrating them and 
allowing the weight of the hammer to 
push them into the substrate. Vibratory 
hammers typically produce less sound 
(i.e., lower levels) than impact hammers. Peak sound pressure levels 
(SPLs) may be 180 dB or greater but are 
generally 10 to 20 dB lower than SPLs 
generated during impact pile driving of 
the same-sized pile (Oestman et al., 
2009; California Department of 
Transportation (CALTRANS), 2015, 
2020). Sounds produced by vibratory 
hammers are non-impulsive; compared 
to sounds produced by impact 
hammers, the rise time is slower, 
reducing the probability and severity of 
injury, and the sound energy is 
distributed over more time (Nedwell 
and Edwards, 2002; Carlson et al., 
2005). 
The likely or possible impacts of 
ADOT&PF’s proposed activities on 
marine mammals could involve both 
non-acoustic and acoustic stressors. 
Potential non-acoustic stressors could 
result from the physical presence of the 
equipment and personnel. However, 
given there are no known pinniped 
haul-out sites in the vicinity of the 
project site, visual and other non- 
acoustic stressors would be limited, and 
any impacts to marine mammals are 
expected to primarily be acoustic in 
nature. While there are known rookeries 
for Steller sea lions at Clubbing Rocks 
North (57 km (35.4 mi) to the south), 
Clubbing Rocks South (58 km (36 mi) to 
the south), and Pinnacle Rock (76 km 
(47.2 mi) to the southeast), no Steller sea 
lion haulouts have been reported in 
Cold Bay (Fritz et al., 2015). 
Additionally, while harbor seals are 
known to haul out at the mouth of 
Kinzarof Lagoon, the mouth of the 
Lagoon is approximately 8.35 km (5.2 
mi) away the existing Cold Bay dock 
and the largest isopleth for any in-air 
noises from construction is 0.152 km 
(0.09 mi), meaning that any harbor seals 
near the Lagoon would not be affected 
by in-air noises (table 5). Therefore, 
NMFS considers take from in-air 
exposures to be unlikely, and it is not 
considered further in this notice.

Potential Effects of Underwater Sound 
on Marine Mammals 
The introduction of anthropogenic 
noise into the aquatic environment from 
impact and vibratory pile driving is the 
primary means by which marine 
mammals may be harassed from 
ADOT&PF’s specified activity. 
Anthropogenic sounds cover a broad 
range of frequencies and sound levels 
and can have a range of highly variable 
impacts on marine life from none or 
minor to potentially severe responses 
depending on received levels, duration 
of exposure, behavioral context, and 
various other factors. Broadly, 
underwater sound from active acoustic 
sources, such as those in the project, can 
potentially result in one or more of the 
following: temporary or permanent 
hearing impairment, non-auditory 
physical or physiological effects, 
behavioral disturbance, stress, and 
masking (Richardson et al., 1995; 
Gordon et al., 2003; Nowacek et al., 2007; Southall et al., 2007; Go¨tz et al., 2009). 
We describe the more severe effects of 
certain non-auditory physical or 
physiological effects only briefly as we 
do not expect that use of impact and 
vibratory hammers are reasonably likely 
to result in such effects (see below for 
further discussion). Potential effects 
from impulsive sound sources can range 
in severity from effects such as 
behavioral disturbance or tactile 
perception to physical discomfort, slight 
injury of the internal organs and the 
auditory system, or mortality (Yelverton 
et al., 1973). Non-auditory physiological 
effects or injuries that theoretically 
might occur in marine mammals 
exposed to high level underwater sound 
or as a secondary effect of extreme 
behavioral reactions (e.g., change in dive profile as a result of an avoidance 
reaction) caused by exposure to sound 
include neurological effects, bubble 
formation, resonance effects, and other 
types of organ or tissue damage (Cox et 
al., 2006; Southall et al., 2007; Zimmer and Tyack, 2007; Tal et al., 2015). The 
proposed project activities considered 
here do not involve the use of devices 
such as explosives or mid-frequency 
tactical sonar that are associated with 
these types of effects. 
In general, animals exposed to natural 
or anthropogenic sound may experience 
physical and psychological effects, 
ranging in magnitude from none to 
severe (Southall et al., 2007, 2019). 
Exposure to anthropogenic noise has the 
potential to result in auditory threshold 
shifts and behavioral reactions (e.g., 
avoidance, temporary cessation of 
foraging and vocalizing, changes in dive

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60661 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices behavior). It can also lead to non- 
observable physiological responses, 
such an increase in stress hormones. 
Additional noise in a marine mammal’s 
habitat can mask acoustic cues used by 
marine mammals to carry out daily 
functions, such as communication and 
predator and prey detection. 
The degree of effect of an acoustic 
exposure on marine mammals is 
dependent on several factors, including, 
but not limited to, sound type (e.g., 
impulsive vs. non-impulsive), signal 
characteristics, the species, age and sex 
class (e.g., adult male vs. mom with calf), duration of exposure, the distance 
between the noise source and the 
animal, received levels, behavioral state 
at time of exposure, and previous 
history with exposure (Wartzok et al., 
2004; Southall et al., 2007). In general, 
sudden, high-intensity sounds can cause 
hearing loss, as can longer exposures to 
lower-intensity sounds. Moreover, any 
temporary or permanent loss of hearing, 
if it occurs at all, would occur almost 
exclusively for noise within an animal’s 
hearing range. We describe below the 
specific manifestations of acoustic 
effects that may occur based on the 
activities proposed by ADOT&PF. 
Richardson et al. (1995) described zones of increasing intensity of effect 
that might be expected to occur in 
relation to distance from a source and 
assuming that the signal is within an 
animal’s hearing range. First (at the 
greatest distance) is the area within 
which the acoustic signal would be 
audible (potentially perceived) to the 
animal but not strong enough to elicit 
any overt behavioral or physiological 
response. The next zone (closer to the 
receiving animal) corresponds with the 
area where the signal is audible to the 
animal and of sufficient intensity to 
elicit behavioral or physiological 
responsiveness. The third is a zone 
within which, for signals of high 
intensity, the received level is sufficient 
to potentially cause discomfort or tissue 
damage to auditory or other systems. 
Overlaying these zones to a certain 
extent is the area within which masking 
(i.e., when a sound interferes with or masks the ability of an animal to detect 
a signal of interest that is above the 
absolute hearing threshold) may occur; 
the masking zone may be highly 
variable in size. 
Below, we provide additional detail 
regarding potential impacts on marine 
mammals and their habitat from noise 
in general, starting with hearing 
impairment, as well as from the specific 
activities ADOT&PF plans to conduct, to 
the degree it is available. 
Hearing Threshold Shifts— NMFS 
defines a noise-induced threshold shift 
(TS) as a change, usually an increase, in 
the threshold of audibility at a specified 
frequency or portion of an individual’s 
hearing range above a previously 
established reference level (NMFS, 
2018, 2024). The amount of threshold 
shift is customarily expressed in dB. TS 
can be permanent or temporary. As 
described in NMFS (2018, 2024) there 
are numerous factors to consider when 
examining the consequence of TS, 
including, but not limited to, the signal 
temporal pattern (e.g., impulsive or non- impulsive), likelihood an individual 
would be exposed for a long enough 
duration or to a high enough level to 
induce a TS, the magnitude of the TS, 
time to recovery (seconds to minutes or 
hours to days), the frequency range of 
the exposure (i.e., spectral content), the hearing frequency range of the exposed 
species relative to the signal’s frequency 
spectrum (i.e., how animal uses sound within the frequency band of the signal; 
e.g., Kastelein et al., 2014), and the overlap between the animal and the 
source (e.g., spatial, temporal, and spectral). 
Auditory Injury (AUD INJ)— NMFS 
(2024) defines AUD INJ as damage to the 
inner ear that can result in destruction 
of tissue, such as the loss of cochlear 
neuron synapses or auditory neuropathy 
(Houser, 2021; Finneran, 2024). AUD 
INJ may or may not result in a 
permanent threshold shift (PTS). PTS is 
subsequently defined as a permanent, 
irreversible increase in the threshold of 
audibility at a specified frequency or 
portion of an individual’s hearing range 
above a previously established reference 
level (NMFS, 2024). PTS does not 
generally affect more than a limited 
frequency range, and an animal that has 
incurred PTS has some level of hearing 
loss at the relevant frequencies; 
typically, animals with PTS or other 
AUD INJ are not functionally deaf (Au 
and Hastings, 2008; Finneran, 2016). 
Available data from humans and other 
terrestrial mammals indicate that a 40- 
dB threshold shift approximates AUD 
INJ onset (see Ward et al., 1958, 1959; 
Ward, 1960; Kryter et al., 1966; Miller, 
1974; Ahroon et al., 1996; Henderson et 
al., 2008). AUD INJ levels for marine mammals are estimates, as with the 
exception of a single study 
unintentionally inducing PTS in a 
harbor seal (Kastak et al., 2008), there 
are no empirical data measuring AUD 
INJ in marine mammals largely due to 
the fact that, for various ethical reasons, 
experiments involving anthropogenic 
noise exposure at levels inducing AUD 
INJ are not typically pursued or 
authorized (NMFS, 2024). 
Temporary Threshold Shift (TTS)— 
TTS is a temporary, reversible increase 
in the threshold of audibility at a 
specified frequency or portion of an 
individual’s hearing range above a 
previously established reference level 
(NMFS, 2024), and is not considered an 
AUD INJ. Based on data from marine 
mammal TTS measurements (see 
Southall et al., 2007, 2019), a TTS of 6 dB is considered the minimum 
threshold shift clearly larger than any 
day-to-day or session-to-session 
variation in a subject’s normal hearing 
ability (Finneran et al., 2000, 2002; 
Schlundt et al., 2000). As described in Finneran (2015), marine mammal 
studies have shown the amount of TTS 
increases with the 24-hour cumulative 
sound exposure level (SEL
24
) in an 
accelerating fashion: at low exposures 
with lower SEL
24
, the amount of TTS is 
typically small and the growth curves 
have shallow slopes. At exposures with 
higher SEL
24
, the growth curves become 
steeper and approach linear 
relationships with the sound exposure 
level (SEL). 
Depending on the degree (elevation of 
threshold in dB), duration (i.e., recovery time), and frequency range of TTS, and 
the context in which it is experienced, 
TTS can have effects on marine 
mammals ranging from discountable to 
more impactful (similar to those 
discussed in auditory masking, below). 
For example, a marine mammal may be 
able to readily compensate for a brief, 
relatively small amount of TTS in a non- 
critical frequency range that takes place 
during a time when the animal is 
traveling through the open ocean, where 
ambient noise is lower and there are not 
as many competing sounds present. 
Alternatively, a larger amount and 
longer duration of TTS sustained during 
time when communication is critical for 
successful mother/calf interactions 
could have more severe impacts. We 
note that reduced hearing sensitivity as 
a simple function of aging has been 
observed in marine mammals, as well as 
humans and other taxa (Southall et al., 
2007), so we can infer that strategies 
exist for coping with this condition to 
some degree, though likely not without 
cost. 
Many studies have examined noise- 
induced hearing loss in marine 
mammals (see Finneran (2015) and 
Southall et al. (2019) for summaries). TTS is the mildest form of hearing 
impairment that can occur during 
exposure to sound (Kryter, 2013). While 
experiencing TTS, the hearing threshold 
rises, and a sound must be at a higher 
level in order to be heard. In terrestrial 
and marine mammals, TTS can last from 
minutes or hours to days (in cases of 
strong TTS). In many cases, hearing 
sensitivity recovers rapidly after

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60662 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices exposure to the sound ends. For 
cetaceans, published data on the onset 
of TTS are limited to captive bottlenose 
dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), beluga 
whale (Delphinapterus leucas), harbor 
porpoise, and Yangtze finless porpoise 
(Neophocoena asiaeorientalis) (Southall 
et al., 2019). For pinnipeds in water, 
measurements of TTS are limited to 
harbor seals, elephant seals (Mirounga 
angustirostris), bearded seals 
(Erignathus barbatus) and California sea 
lions (Zalophus californianus) (Kastak 
et al., 1999, 2007; Kastelein et al., 
2019b, 2019c, 2021, 2022a, 2022b; 
Reichmuth et al., 2019; Sills et al., 2020). TTS was not observed in spotted 
(Phoca largha) and ringed (Pusa 
hispida) seals exposed to single airgun 
impulse sounds at levels matching 
previous predictions of TTS onset 
(Reichmuth et al., 2016). These studies examine hearing thresholds measured in 
marine mammals before and after 
exposure to intense or long-duration 
sound exposures. The difference 
between the pre-exposure and post- 
exposure thresholds can be used to 
determine the amount of threshold shift 
at various post-exposure times. 
The amount and onset of TTS 
depends on the exposure frequency. 
Sounds below the region of best 
sensitivity for a species or hearing group 
are less hazardous than those near the 
region of best sensitivity (Finneran and 
Schlundt, 2013). At low frequencies, 
onset-TTS exposure levels are higher 
compared to those in the region of best 
sensitivity (i.e., a low frequency noise would need to be louder to cause TTS 
onset when TTS exposure level is 
higher), as shown for harbor porpoises 
and harbor seals (Kastelein et al., 2019a, 
2019c). Note that in general, harbor 
seals and harbor porpoises have a lower 
TTS onset than other measured 
pinniped or cetacean species (Finneran, 
2015). In addition, TTS can accumulate 
across multiple exposures, but the 
resulting TTS would be less than the 
TTS from a single, continuous exposure 
with the same SEL (Mooney et al., 2009; 
Finneran et al., 2010; Kastelein et al., 2014, 2015). This means that TTS 
predictions based on the total, SEL
24
 
would overestimate the amount of TTS 
from intermittent exposures, such as 
sonars and impulsive sources. 
Nachtigall et al. (2018) describe measurements of hearing sensitivity of 
multiple odontocete species (bottlenose 
dolphin, harbor porpoise, beluga, and 
false killer whale (Pseudorca 
crassidens)) when a relatively loud 
sound was preceded by a warning 
sound. These captive animals were 
shown to reduce hearing sensitivity 
when warned of an impending intense 
sound. Based on these experimental 
observations of captive animals, the 
authors suggest that wild animals may 
dampen their hearing during prolonged 
exposures or if conditioned to anticipate 
intense sounds. Another study showed 
that echolocating animals (including 
odontocetes) might have anatomical 
specializations that might allow for 
conditioned hearing reduction and 
filtering of low-frequency ambient 
noise, including increased stiffness and 
control of middle ear structures and 
placement of inner ear structures 
(Ketten et al., 2021). Data available on noise-induced hearing loss for 
mysticetes are currently lacking (NMFS, 
2024). Additionally, the existing marine 
mammal TTS data come from a limited 
number of individuals within these 
species. 
Relationships between TTS and AUD 
INJ thresholds have not been studied in 
marine mammals, and there are no 
measured PTS data for cetaceans, but 
such relationships are assumed to be 
similar to those in humans and other 
terrestrial mammals. AUD INJ typically 
occurs at exposure levels at least several 
dB above that inducing mild TTS (e.g., 
a 40-dB threshold shift approximates 
AUD INJ onset (Kryter et al., 1966; 
Miller, 1974), while a 6-dB threshold 
shift approximates TTS onset (Southall 
et al., 2007, 2019). Based on data from 
terrestrial mammals, a precautionary 
assumption is that the AUD INJ 
thresholds for impulsive sounds (such 
as impact pile driving pulses as received 
close to the source) are at least 6 dB 
higher than the TTS threshold on a 
peak-pressure basis and AUD INJ 
cumulative sound exposure level 
thresholds are 15 to 20 dB higher than 
TTS cumulative sound exposure level 
thresholds (Southall et al., 2007, 2019). 
Given the higher level of sound or 
longer exposure duration necessary to 
cause AUD INJ as compared with TTS, 
it is considerably less likely that AUD 
INJ could occur. Given the stationary 
nature of the construction activities, the 
fact that Cold Bay is relatively sheltered 
(i.e., not located in the open ocean), and the fact that many marine mammals are 
likely moving through the project areas 
and not remaining for extended periods 
of time, the potential for threshold shift 
is low for most species. 
Behavioral Effects—Exposure to noise 
also has the potential to behaviorally 
disturb marine mammal response—in 
other words, not every response 
qualifies as behavioral disturbance, and 
for responses that do, those of a higher 
level, or accrued across a longer 
duration, have the potential to affect 
foraging, reproduction, or survival. 
Behavioral disturbance may include a 
variety of effects, including subtle 
changes in behavior (e.g., minor or brief avoidance of an area or changes in 
vocalizations), more conspicuous 
changes in similar behavioral activities, 
and more sustained and/or potentially 
severe reactions, such as displacement 
from or abandonment of high-quality 
habitat. Behavioral responses may 
include changing durations of surfacing 
and dives, changing direction and/or 
speed; reducing/increasing vocal 
activities; changing/cessation of certain 
behavioral activities (such as socializing 
or feeding); eliciting a visible startle 
response or aggressive behavior (such as 
tail/fin slapping or jaw clapping); and 
avoidance of areas where sound sources 
are located. In addition, pinnipeds may 
increase their haul out time, possibly to 
avoid in-water disturbance (Thorson 
and Reyff, 2006). 
Behavioral responses to sound are 
highly variable and context-specific and 
any reactions depend on numerous 
intrinsic and extrinsic factors (e.g., 
species, state of maturity, experience, 
current activity, reproductive state, 
auditory sensitivity, time of day), as 
well as the interplay between factors 
(e.g., Richardson et al., 1995; Wartzok et al., 2004; Southall et al., 2007, 2019; Weilgart, 2007; Archer et al., 2010). 
Behavioral reactions can vary not only 
among individuals but also within an 
individual, depending on previous 
experience with a sound source, 
context, and numerous other factors 
(Ellison et al., 2012), and can vary depending on characteristics associated 
with the sound source (e.g., whether it is moving or stationary, number of 
sources, distance from the source). In 
general, pinnipeds seem more tolerant 
of, or at least habituate more quickly to, 
potentially disturbing underwater sound 
than do cetaceans, and generally seem 
to be less responsive to exposure to 
industrial sound than most cetaceans. 
Please see Appendices B and C of 
Southall et al. (2007) and Gomez et al. (2016) for reviews of studies involving 
marine mammal behavioral responses to 
sound. 
Habituation can occur when an 
animal’s response to a stimulus wanes 
with repeated exposure, usually in the 
absence of unpleasant associated events 
(Wartzok et al., 2004). Animals are most likely to habituate to sounds that are 
predictable and unvarying. It is 
important to note that habituation is 
appropriately considered as a 
‘‘progressive reduction in response to 
stimuli that are perceived as neither 
aversive nor beneficial,’’ rather than as,

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60663 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices 2009). The opposite process is 
sensitization, when an unpleasant 
experience leads to subsequent 
responses, often in the form of 
avoidance, at a lower level of exposure. 
As noted above, behavioral state may 
affect the type of response. For example, 
animals that are resting may show 
greater behavioral change in response to 
disturbing sound levels than animals 
that are highly motivated to remain in 
an area for feeding (Richardson et al., 
1995; Wartzok et al., 2004; National 
Research Council (NRC), 2005). 
Controlled experiments with captive 
marine mammals have shown 
pronounced behavioral reactions, 
including avoidance of loud sound 
sources (Ridgway et al., 1997; Finneran 
et al., 2003). Observed responses of wild 
marine mammals to loud-pulsed sound 
sources (e.g., seismic airguns) have been varied but often consist of avoidance 
behavior or other behavioral changes 
(Richardson et al., 1995; Morton and Symonds, 2002; Nowacek et al., 2007). 
Available studies show wide variation 
in response to underwater sound; 
therefore, it is difficult to predict 
specifically how any given sound in a 
particular instance might affect marine 
mammals perceiving the signal (e.g., 
Erbe et al., 2019). If a marine mammal does react briefly to an underwater 
sound by changing its behavior or 
moving a small distance, the impacts of 
the change are unlikely to be significant 
to the individual, let alone the stock or 
population. If a sound source displaces 
marine mammals from an important 
feeding or breeding area for a prolonged 
period, impacts on individuals and 
populations could be significant (e.g., 
Lusseau and Bejder, 2007; Weilgart, 
2007; NRC, 2005). However, there are 
broad categories of potential response, 
which we describe in greater detail here, 
that include alteration of dive behavior, 
alteration of foraging behavior, effects to 
breathing, interference with or alteration 
of vocalization, avoidance, and flight. 
Avoidance and displacement— 
Changes in dive behavior can vary 
widely and may consist of increased or 
decreased dive times and surface 
intervals as well as changes in the rates 
of ascent and descent during a dive (e.g., 
Frankel and Clark, 2000; Costa et al., 
2003; Ng and Leung, 2003; Nowacek et 
al., 2004; Goldbogen et al., 2013a, 2013b, Blair et al., 2016). Variations in 
dive behavior may reflect interruptions 
in biologically significant activities (e.g., 
foraging) or they may be of little 
biological significance. The impact of an 
alteration to dive behavior resulting 
from an acoustic exposure depends on 
what the animal is doing at the time of 
the exposure and the type and 
magnitude of the response. 
Disruption of feeding behavior can be 
difficult to correlate with anthropogenic 
sound exposure, so it is usually inferred 
by observed displacement from known 
foraging areas, the appearance of 
secondary indicators (e.g., bubble nets or sediment plumes), or changes in dive 
behavior. Acoustic and movement bio- 
logging tools also have been used in 
some cases to infer responses to 
anthropogenic noise. For example, Blair 
et al. (2015) reported significant effects 
on humpback whale foraging behavior 
in Stellwagen Bank in response to ship 
noise including slower descent rates, 
and fewer side-rolling events per dive 
with increasing ship nose. In addition, 
Wisniewska et al. (2018) reported that tagged harbor porpoises demonstrated 
fewer prey capture attempts when 
encountering occasional high-noise 
levels resulting from vessel noise as 
well as more vigorous fluking, 
interrupted foraging, and cessation of 
echolocation signals observed in 
response to some high-noise vessel 
passes. As for other types of behavioral 
response, the frequency, duration, and 
temporal pattern of signal presentation, 
as well as differences in species 
sensitivity, are likely contributing 
factors to differences in response in any 
given circumstance (e.g., Croll et al., 2001; Nowacek et al., 2004; Madsen et 
al., 2006; Yazvenko et al., 2007). A determination of whether foraging 
disruptions incur fitness consequences 
would require information on or 
estimates of the energetic requirements 
of the affected individuals and the 
relationship between prey availability, 
foraging effort and success, and the life 
history stage of the animal. 
Respiration rates vary naturally with 
different behaviors and alterations to 
breathing rate as a function of acoustic 
exposure can be expected to co-occur 
with other behavioral reactions, such as 
a flight response or an alteration in 
diving. However, respiration rates in 
and of themselves may be representative 
of annoyance or an acute stress 
response. Various studies have shown 
that respiration rates may either be 
unaffected or could increase, depending 
on the species and signal characteristics, 
again highlighting the importance in 
understanding species differences in the 
tolerance of underwater noise when 
determining the potential for impacts 
resulting from anthropogenic sound 
exposure (e.g., Kastelein et al., 2001; 2005; 2006; Gailey et al., 2007). For 
example, harbor porpoise respiration 
rates increased in response to pile 
driving sounds at and above a received 
broadband SPL of 136 dB (zero-peak 
SPL: 151 dB re 1 mPa; SEL of a single 
strike (SEL
ss
): 127 dB re 1 mPa
2
-s) 
(Kastelein et al., 2013). Avoidance is the displacement of an 
individual from an area or migration 
path as a result of the presence of a 
sound or other stressors, and is one of 
the most obvious manifestations of 
disturbance in marine mammals 
(Richardson et al., 1995). For example, gray whales are known to change 
direction—deflecting from customary 
migratory paths—in order to avoid noise 
from seismic surveys (Malme et al., 
1984). Harbor porpoises, Atlantic white- 
sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus 
actusus), and minke whales 
(Balaenoptera acutorostrata) have 
demonstrated avoidance in response to 
vessels during line transect surveys 
(Palka and Hammond, 2001). In 
addition, beluga whales in the St. 
Lawrence Estuary in Canada have been 
reported to increase levels of avoidance 
with increased boat presence by way of 
increased dive durations and swim 
speeds, decreased surfacing intervals, 
and by bunching together into groups 
(Blane and Jaakson, 1994). Avoidance 
may be short-term, with animals 
returning to the area once the noise has 
ceased (e.g., Bowles et al., 1994; Goold, 1996; Stone et al., 2000; Morton and 
Symonds, 2002; Gailey et al., 2007). 
Longer-term displacement is possible, 
however, which may lead to changes in 
abundance or distribution patterns of 
the affected species in the affected 
region if habituation to the presence of 
the sound does not occur (e.g., 
Blackwell et al., 2004; Bejder et al., 2006; Teilmann et al., 2006). 
A flight response is a dramatic change 
in normal movement to a directed and 
rapid movement away from the 
perceived location of a sound source. 
The flight response differs from other 
avoidance responses in the intensity of 
the response (e.g., directed movement, rate of travel). Relatively little 
information on flight responses of 
marine mammals to anthropogenic 
signals exist, although observations of 
flight responses to the presence of 
predators have occurred (Connor and 
Heithaus, 1996; Bowers et al., 2018). 
The result of a flight response could 
range from brief, temporary exertion and 
displacement from the area where the 
signal provokes flight to, in extreme 
cases, marine mammal strandings 
(England et al., 2001). However, it should be noted that response to a 
perceived predator does not necessarily 
invoke flight (Ford and Reeves, 2008), 
and whether individuals are solitary or 
in groups may influence the response. 
Behavioral disturbance can also 
impact marine mammals in more subtle

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60664 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices ways. Increased vigilance may result in 
costs related to diversion of focus and 
attention (i.e., when a response consists of increased vigilance, it may come at 
the cost of decreased attention to other 
critical behaviors such as foraging or 
resting). These effects have generally not 
been demonstrated for marine 
mammals, but studies involving fishes 
and terrestrial animals have shown that 
increased vigilance may substantially 
reduce feeding rates (e.g., Beauchamp and Livoreil, 1997; Fritz et al., 2002; 
Purser and Radford, 2011). In addition, 
chronic disturbance can cause 
population declines through reduction 
of fitness (e.g., decline in body condition) and subsequent reduction in 
reproductive success, survival, or both 
(e.g., Harrington and Veitch, 1992; Daan et al., 1996; Bradshaw et al., 1998). 
However, Ridgway et al. (2006) reported 
that increased vigilance in bottlenose 
dolphins exposed to sound over a 5-day 
period did not cause any sleep 
deprivation or stress effects. 
Many animals perform vital functions, 
such as feeding, resting, traveling, and 
socializing, on a diel cycle (24-hour 
cycle). Disruption of such functions 
resulting from reactions to stressors 
such as sound exposure are more likely 
to be significant if they last more than 
one diel cycle or recur on subsequent 
days (Southall et al., 2007). 
Consequently, a behavioral response 
lasting less than 1 day and not recurring 
on subsequent days is not considered 
particularly severe unless it could 
directly affect reproduction or survival 
(Southall et al., 2007). Note that there is a difference between multi-day 
substantive (i.e., meaningful) behavioral reactions and multi-day anthropogenic 
activities. For example, just because an 
activity lasts for multiple days does not 
necessarily mean that individual 
animals are either exposed to activity- 
related stressors for multiple days or, 
further, exposed in a manner resulting 
in sustained multi-day substantive 
behavioral responses. 
Physiological stress responses—An 
animal’s perception of a threat may be 
sufficient to trigger stress responses 
consisting of some combination of 
behavioral responses, autonomic 
nervous system responses, 
neuroendocrine responses, or immune 
responses (e.g., Selye, 1950; Moberg, 2000). In many cases, an animal’s first 
and sometimes most economical (in 
terms of energetic costs) response is 
behavioral avoidance of the potential 
stressor. Autonomic nervous system 
responses to stress typically involve 
changes in heart rate, blood pressure, 
and gastrointestinal activity. These 
responses have a relatively short 
duration and may or may not have a 
significant long-term effect on an 
animal’s fitness. 
Neuroendocrine stress responses often 
involve the hypothalamus-pituitary- 
adrenal system. Virtually all 
neuroendocrine functions that are 
affected by stress—including immune 
competence, reproduction, metabolism, 
and behavior—are regulated by pituitary 
hormones. Stress-induced changes in 
the secretion of pituitary hormones have 
been implicated in failed reproduction, 
altered metabolism, reduced immune 
competence, and behavioral disturbance 
(e.g., Moberg, 1987; Blecha, 2000). Increases in the circulation of 
glucocorticoids are also equated with 
stress (Romano et al., 2004). 
The primary distinction between 
stress (which is adaptive and does not 
normally place an animal at risk) and 
‘‘distress’’ is the cost of the response. 
During a stress response, an animal uses 
glycogen stores that can be quickly 
replenished once the stress is alleviated. 
In such circumstances, the cost of the 
stress response would not pose serious 
fitness consequences. However, when 
an animal does not have sufficient 
energy reserves to satisfy the energetic 
costs of a stress response, energy 
resources must be diverted from other 
functions. This state of distress would 
last until the animal replenishes its 
energetic reserves sufficient to restore 
normal function. 
Relationships between these 
physiological mechanisms, animal 
behavior, and the costs of stress 
responses are well studied through 
controlled experiments and for both 
laboratory and free-ranging animals 
(e.g., Holberton et al., 1996; Hood et al., 1998; Jessop et al., 2003; Krausman et 
al., 2004; Lankford et al., 2005; Ayres et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2022). Stress responses due to exposure to 
anthropogenic sounds or other stressors 
and their effects on marine mammals 
have also been reviewed (Fair and 
Becker, 2000; Romano et al., 2002b) 
and, more rarely, studied in wild 
populations (e.g., Romano et al., 2002a). For example, Rolland et al. (2012) found 
that noise reduction from reduced ship 
traffic in the Bay of Fundy was 
associated with decreased stress in 
North Atlantic right whales. In addition, 
Lemos et al. (2022) observed a correlation between higher levels of 
fecal glucocorticoid metabolite 
concentrations (indicative of a stress 
response) and vessel traffic in gray 
whales. Yang et al. (2022) studied 
behavioral and physiological responses 
in captive bottlenose dolphins exposed 
to playbacks of ‘‘pile-driving-like’’ 
impulsive sounds, finding significant 
changes in cortisol and other 
physiological indicators but only minor 
behavioral changes. These and other 
studies lead to a reasonable expectation 
that some marine mammals would 
experience physiological stress 
responses upon exposure to acoustic 
stressors and that it is possible that 
some of these would be classified as 
‘‘distress.’’ In addition, any animal 
experiencing TTS would likely also 
experience stress responses (NRC, 
2005), however distress is an unlikely 
result of this project based on 
observations of marine mammals during 
previous, similar construction projects. 
Vocalizations and Auditory 
Masking—Since many marine mammals 
rely on sound to find prey, moderate 
social interactions, and facilitate mating 
(Tyack, 2008), noise from anthropogenic 
sound sources can interfere with these 
functions, but only if the noise spectrum 
overlaps with the hearing sensitivity of 
the receiving marine mammal (Southall 
et al., 2007; Clark et al., 2009; Hatch et al., 2012). Chronic exposure to excessive, though not high-intensity, 
noise could cause masking at particular 
frequencies for marine mammals that 
utilize sound for vital biological 
functions (Clark et al., 2009). Acoustic 
masking is when other noises such as 
from human sources interfere with an 
animal’s ability to detect, recognize, or 
discriminate between acoustic signals of 
interest (e.g., those used for intraspecific communication and social interactions, 
prey detection, predator avoidance, 
navigation) (Richardson et al., 1995; 
Erbe et al., 2016). Therefore, under certain circumstances, for marine 
mammals whose acoustic sensors or 
environment are being severely masked 
could also be impaired from maximizing 
their performance fitness in survival 
and reproduction. The ability of a noise 
source to mask biologically important 
sounds depends on the characteristics of 
both the noise source and the signal of 
interest (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio, temporal variability, direction), in 
relation to each other and to an animal’s 
hearing abilities (e.g., sensitivity, frequency range, critical ratios, 
frequency discrimination, directional 
discrimination, age or TTS hearing loss), 
and existing ambient noise and 
propagation conditions (Hotchkin and 
Parks, 2013). 
Marine mammals vocalize for 
different purposes and across multiple 
modes, such as whistling, echolocation 
click production, calling, and singing. 
Changes in vocalization behavior in 
response to anthropogenic noise can 
occur for any of these modes and may 
result from a need to compete with an 
increase in background noise or may

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60665 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices reflect increased vigilance or a startle 
response. For example, in the presence 
of potentially masking signals, 
humpback whales and killer whales 
have been observed to increase the 
length of their songs (Miller et al., 2000; 
Fristrup et al., 2003) or vocalizations (Foote et al., 2004), respectively, while North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena 
glacialis) have been observed to shift the 
frequency content of their calls upward 
while reducing the rate of calling in 
areas of increased anthropogenic noise 
(Parks et al., 2007). Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) have also been 
documented lowering the bandwidth, 
peak frequency, and center frequency of 
their vocalizations under increased 
levels of background noise from large 
vessels (Castellote et al. 2012). Other 
alterations to communication signals 
have also been observed. For example, 
gray whales, in response to playback 
experiments exposing them to vessel 
noise, have been observed increasing 
their vocalization rate and producing 
louder signals at times of increased 
outboard engine noise (Dahlheim and 
Castellote, 2016). Alternatively, in some 
cases, animals may cease sound 
production during production of 
aversive signals (Bowles et al., 1994, 
Wisniewska et al., 2018). Under certain circumstances, marine 
mammals experiencing significant 
masking could also be impaired from 
maximizing their performance fitness in 
survival and reproduction. Therefore, 
when the coincident (masking) sound is 
human-made, it may be considered 
harassment when disrupting or altering 
critical behaviors. It is important to 
distinguish TTS and PTS, which persist 
after the sound exposure, from masking, 
which occurs during the sound 
exposure. Because masking (without 
resulting in TS) is not associated with 
abnormal physiological function, it is 
not considered a physiological effect, 
but rather a potential behavioral effect 
(though not necessarily one that would 
be associated with harassment). 
The frequency range of the potentially 
masking sound is important in 
determining any potential behavioral 
impacts. For example, low-frequency 
signals may have less effect on high- 
frequency echolocation sounds 
produced by odontocetes but are more 
likely to affect detection of mysticete 
communication calls and other 
potentially important natural sounds 
such as those produced by surf and 
some prey species. The masking of 
communication signals by 
anthropogenic noise may be considered 
as a reduction in the communication 
space of animals (e.g., Clark et al., 2009) and may result in energetic or other 
costs as animals change their 
vocalization behavior (e.g., Miller et al., 2000; Foote et al., 2004; Parks et al., 
2007; Di Iorio and Clark, 2010; Holt et 
al., 2009). Masking can be reduced in situations where the signal and noise 
come from different directions 
(Richardson et al., 1995), through amplitude modulation of the signal, or 
through other compensatory behaviors, 
including modifications of the acoustic 
properties of the signal or the signaling 
behavior (Hotchkin and Parks, 2013). 
Masking can be tested directly in 
captive species (e.g., Erbe, 2008), but in wild populations it must be either 
modeled or inferred from evidence of 
masking compensation. There are few 
studies addressing real-world masking 
sounds likely to be experienced by 
marine mammals in the wild (e.g., 
Branstetter et al., 2013). Masking occurs in the frequency band 
that the animals utilize and is more 
likely to occur in the presence of 
broadband, relatively continuous noise 
sources such as vibratory pile driving. 
Energy distribution of vibratory pile 
driving sound covers a broad frequency 
spectrum and is anticipated to be within 
the audible range of marine mammals 
present in the proposed action area. 
Since noises generated from the 
proposed construction activities are 
mostly concentrated at low frequencies 
(<2 kHz), these activities likely have less 
effect on mid-frequency echolocation 
sounds produced by odontocetes 
(toothed whales). However, lower 
frequency noises are more likely to 
affect detection of communication calls 
and other potentially important natural 
sounds such as surf and prey noise. 
Low-frequency noise may also affect 
communication signals when they occur 
near the frequency band for noise and 
thus reduce the communication space of 
animals (e.g., Clark et al., 2009) and cause increased stress levels (e.g., Holt et al., 2009). Unlike TS, masking, which 
can occur over large temporal and 
spatial scales, can potentially affect the 
species at population, community, or 
even ecosystem levels, in addition to 
individual levels. Masking affects both 
senders and receivers of the signals, and 
at higher levels for longer durations, 
could have long-term chronic effects on 
marine mammal species and 
populations. However, the noise 
generated by ADOT&PF’s proposed 
activities would only occur 
intermittently, across an estimated 231 
(not necessarily consecutive) days 
during the proposed authorization 
period in a relatively small area focused 
around the proposed construction site. 
Thus, while the ADOT&PF’s proposed 
activities may mask some acoustic 
signals that are relevant to the daily 
behavior of marine mammals, the short- 
term duration and limited areas affected 
make it very unlikely that the fitness of 
individual marine mammals would be 
impacted. 
While in some cases marine mammals 
have exhibited little to no obviously 
detectable response to certain common 
or routine industrialized activities 
(Cornick et al., 2011; Horley and Larson, 2023), it is possible some animals may 
at times be exposed to received levels of 
sound above the AUD INJ and Level B 
harassment thresholds during the 
proposed project. This potential 
exposure in combination with the 
nature of planned activity (e.g., 
vibratory pile driving, impact pile 
driving) means it is possible that take by 
Level A and Level B harassment could 
occur over the total estimated period of 
activities; therefore, NMFS, in response 
to ADOT&PF’s IHA application, 
proposes to authorize take by Level A 
and Level B harassment from 
ADOT&PF’s proposed construction 
activities. 
Airborne Acoustic Effects—Pinnipeds 
that occur near the project site could be 
exposed to airborne sounds associated 
with construction activities that have 
the potential to cause behavioral 
harassment, depending on their distance 
from these activities. Airborne noise 
would primarily be an issue for 
pinnipeds that are swimming or hauled 
out near the project site within the range 
of noise levels elevated above airborne 
acoustic harassment criteria. As 
described above in Description of Sound 
Sources for the Specified Activities, 
although pinnipeds are known to haul- 
out regularly on man-made objects, we 
believe that incidents of take resulting 
solely from airborne sound are unlikely 
due to the proximity between the 
proposed project area and the known 
haulout sites (refer back to table 5). 
Cetaceans are not expected to be 
exposed to airborne sounds that would 
result in harassment as defined under 
the MMPA. 
We recognize that pinnipeds in the 
water could be exposed to airborne 
sound that may result in behavioral 
harassment when looking with their 
heads above water. Most likely, airborne 
sound would cause behavioral 
responses similar to those discussed 
above in relation to underwater sound. 
For instance, anthropogenic sound 
could cause hauled out pinnipeds to 
exhibit changes in their normal 
behavior, such as reduction in 
vocalizations, or cause them to flush 
from haulouts, temporarily abandon the 
area, and or move further from the

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60666 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices source. However, these animals would 
previously have been ‘‘taken’’ because 
of exposure to underwater sound above 
the behavioral harassment thresholds, 
which are in all cases larger than those 
associated with airborne sound. Thus, 
the behavioral harassment of these 
animals is already accounted for in 
these estimates of potential take. 
Therefore, we do not believe that 
authorization of incidental take 
resulting from airborne sound for 
pinnipeds is warranted, and airborne 
sound is not discussed further here. 
Potential Effects on Marine Mammal 
Habitat 
ADOT&PF’s proposed activities could 
have localized, temporary impacts on 
marine mammal habitat, including prey, 
by increasing in-water SPLs. Increased 
noise levels may affect acoustic habitat 
and adversely affect marine mammal 
prey in the vicinity of the project areas 
(see discussion below). Elevated levels 
of underwater noise would ensonify the 
project areas where both fishes and 
mammals occur and could affect 
foraging success. Additionally, marine 
mammals may avoid the area during the 
proposed construction activities; 
however, displacement due to noise is 
expected to be temporary and is not 
expected to result in long-term effects to 
the individuals or populations. 
The total area likely impacted by 
ADOT&PF’s activities is relatively small 
compared to the available habitat in and 
around Cold Bay. Avoidance by 
potential prey (i.e., fish) of the immediate area due to increased noise 
is possible. The duration of fish and 
marine mammal avoidance of this area 
after tugging stops is unknown, but a 
rapid return to normal recruitment, 
distribution, and behavior is 
anticipated. Any behavioral avoidance 
by fish or marine mammals of the 
disturbed area would still leave 
significantly large areas of fish and 
marine mammal foraging habitat in the 
nearby vicinity. 
The proposed project would occur 
within the same general footprint as the 
existing marine infrastructure. The 
nearshore and intertidal habitat where 
the proposed project would occur is an 
area of relatively high marine vessel 
traffic. Most marine mammals do not 
generally use the area within the 
footprint of the project area. Temporary, 
intermittent, and short-term habitat 
alteration may result from increased 
noise levels during the proposed 
construction activities. Effects on 
marine mammals would be limited to 
temporary displacement from pile 
installation and removal noise, and 
effects on prey species would be 
similarly limited in time and space. 
Water quality—Temporary and 
localized reduction in water quality 
would occur as a result of in-water 
construction activities. Most of this 
effect would occur during the 
installation and removal of piles when 
bottom sediments are disturbed. The 
installation and removal of piles would 
disturb bottom sediments and may 
cause a temporary increase in 
suspended sediment in the project area. 
During pile extraction, sediment 
attached to the pile moves vertically 
through the water column until 
gravitational forces cause it to slough off 
under its own weight. The small 
resulting sediment plume is expected to 
settle out of the water column within a 
few hours. Studies of the effects of 
turbid water on fish (marine mammal 
prey) suggest that concentrations of 
suspended sediment can reach 
thousands of milligrams per liter before 
an acute toxic reaction is expected 
(Burton, 1993). 
Effects to turbidity and sedimentation 
are expected to be short-term, minor, 
and localized. Turbidity within the 
water column has the potential to 
reduce the level of oxygen in the water 
and irritate the gills of prey fish species 
in the proposed project area. However, 
turbidity plumes associated with the 
project would be temporary and 
localized, and fish in the proposed 
project area would be able to move away 
from and avoid the areas where plumes 
may occur. Therefore, it is expected that 
the impacts on prey fish species from 
turbidity, and therefore on marine 
mammals, would be minimal and 
temporary. In general, the area likely 
impacted by the proposed construction 
activities is relatively small compared to 
the available marine mammal habitat in 
Cold Bay. 
Potential Effects on Prey—Sound may 
affect marine mammals through impacts 
on the abundance, behavior, or 
distribution of prey species (e.g., 
crustaceans, cephalopods, fishes, 
zooplankton). Marine mammal prey 
varies by species, season, and location 
and, for some, is not well documented. 
Studies regarding the effects of noise on 
known marine mammal prey are 
described here. 
Fishes utilize the soundscape and 
components of sound in their 
environment to perform important 
functions such as foraging, predator 
avoidance, mating, and spawning (e.g., 
Zelick et al., 1999; Fay, 2009). Depending on their hearing anatomy 
and peripheral sensory structures, 
which vary among species, fishes hear 
sounds using pressure and particle 
motion sensitivity capabilities and 
detect the motion of surrounding water 
(Fay et al., 2008). The potential effects of noise on fishes depends on the 
overlapping frequency range, distance 
from the sound source, water depth of 
exposure, and species-specific hearing 
sensitivity, anatomy, and physiology. 
Key impacts to fishes may include 
behavioral responses, hearing damage, 
barotrauma (pressure-related injuries), 
and mortality. 
Fish react to sounds that are 
especially strong and/or intermittent 
low-frequency sounds, and behavioral 
responses such as flight or avoidance 
are the most likely effects. Short 
duration, sharp sounds can cause overt 
or subtle changes in fish behavior and 
local distribution. The reaction of fish to 
noise depends on the physiological state 
of the fish, past exposures, motivation 
(e.g., feeding, spawning, migration), and other environmental factors. (Hastings 
and Popper, 2005) identified several 
studies that suggest fish may relocate to 
avoid certain areas of sound energy. 
Additional studies have documented 
effects of pile driving on fishes (e.g., 
Scholik and Yan, 2001, 2002; Popper 
and Hastings, 2009). Several studies 
have demonstrated that impulse sounds 
might affect the distribution and 
behavior of some fishes, potentially 
impacting foraging opportunities or 
increasing energetic costs (e.g., Fewtrell and McCauley, 2012; Pearson et al., 
1992; Skalski et al., 1992; Santulli et al., 
1999; Paxton et al., 2017). However, 
some studies have shown no or slight 
reaction to impulse sounds (e.g., Pen˜a et al., 2013; Wardle et al., 2001; Jorgenson and Gyselman, 2009; Cott et al., 2012). 
More commonly, though, the impacts of 
noise on fishes are temporary. For 
example, during the Port of Alaska’s 
Marine Terminal Redevelopment 
Project, the effects of impact and 
vibratory installation of 30-in (76-cm) 
steel sheet piles at the POA on 133 
caged juvenile coho salmon 
(Oncorhynchus kisutc) in Knik Arm 
were studied (Hart Crowser 
Incorporated et al., 2009; Houghton et al., 2010). Acute or delayed mortalities, or behavioral abnormalities were not 
observed in any of the coho salmon. 
Furthermore, results indicated that the 
pile driving had no adverse effect on 
feeding ability or the ability of the fish 
to respond normally to threatening 
stimuli (Hart Crowser Incorporated et 
al., 2009; Houghton et al., 2010). SPLs of sufficient strength have been 
known to cause injury to fishes and fish 
mortality (summarized in Popper et al., 
2014). However, in most fish species, 
hair cells in the ear continuously 
regenerate and loss of auditory function

are replaced with new cells. Halvorsen 
et al. (2012b) showed that a TTS of 4 to 
6 dB was recoverable within 24 hours 
for one species. Impacts would be most 
severe when the individual fish is close 
to the source and when the duration of 
exposure is long. Injury caused by 
barotrauma can range from slight to 
severe and can cause death, and is most 
likely for fish with swim bladders. 
Barotrauma injuries have been 
documented during controlled exposure 
to impact pile driving (Halvorsen et al., 
2012a; Casper et al., 2013, 2017). 
Fish populations in the proposed 
project area that serve as marine 
mammal prey could be temporarily 
affected by noise from pile installation 
and removal. The frequency range in 
which fishes generally perceive 
underwater sounds is 50 to 2,000 Hz, 
with peak sensitivities below 800 Hz 
(Popper and Hastings, 2009). Fish 
behavior or distribution may change, 
especially with strong and/or 
intermittent sounds that could harm 
fishes. High underwater SPLs have been 
documented to alter behavior, cause 
hearing loss, and injure or kill 
individual fish by causing serious 
internal injury (Hastings and Popper, 
2005). 
Zooplankton is a food source for 
several marine mammal species, as well 
as a food source for fish that are then 
preyed upon by marine mammals. 
Population effects on zooplankton could 
have indirect effects on marine 
mammals. Data are limited on the 
effects of underwater sound on 
zooplankton species, particularly sound 
from construction (Erbe et al., 2019). 
Popper and Hastings (2009) reviewed 
information on the effects of human- 
generated sound and concluded that no 
substantive data are available on 
whether the sound levels from pile 
driving, seismic activity, or any human- 
made sound would have physiological 
effects on invertebrates. Any such 
effects would be limited to the area very 
near (1 to 5 m (3.28 to 16.4 ft)) to the 
sound source and would result in no 
population effects because of the 
relatively small area affected at any one 
time and the reproductive strategy of 
most zooplankton species (short 
generation, high fecundity, and very 
high natural mortality). No adverse 
impact on zooplankton populations is 
expected to occur from the specified 
activity due in part to large reproductive 
capacities and naturally high levels of 
predation and mortality of these 
populations. Any mortalities or impacts 
that might occur would be negligible. 
The Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) 
designation for the Cold Bay, Alaska 
region is fundamentally driven by the 
Izembek Lagoon complex, which 
harbors one of the world’s most 
extensive and productive eelgrass 
(Zostera marina) beds (Ward et al., 
1997; Ward and Amundson, 2019; 
Douglas et al., 2024). This submerged aquatic vegetation serves as the 
ecological foundation, acting as a 
critical nursery EFH by providing 
abundant food resources, crucial shelter 
from predators, and favorable 
hydrological conditions necessary for 
the feeding and growth to maturity life 
stages of marine species. The adjacent 
coastal waters also serve as habitat for 
various marine mammals, including 
harbor seals, Steller sea lions, and 
cetaceans such as gray, minke, killer, 
and humpback whales. 
The habitat is vital for sustaining 
major regional fisheries, serving as an 
important area for all five species of 
Pacific salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) 
which utilize the lagoon and associated 
streams for migration and spawning. 
Crucially, the Izembek Lagoon nursery 
supports federally managed crustaceans, 
including juvenile red king crab 
(Paralithodes camtschaticus) and tanner 
crab (Chionoecetes bairdi), whose 
survival is dependent on the shallow, 
protected environment before they move 
to deeper Cold Bay areas as adults (U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, 2024). 
Additionally, the system sustains large 
populations of forage fish (such as 
capelin (Mallotus villosus), sand lance 
(family Ammodytidae), and herring (Clupea pallasii)), Pacific halibut 
(Hippoglossus stenolepis), and Walleye 
Pollack (Gadus chalcogrammus), which 
in turn support high concentrations of 
apex predators (U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, 2024). However, based on the 
potential effects of the proposed project, 
adverse effects on EFH in this area are 
not expected. 
The greatest potential impact to 
marine mammal prey during 
construction would occur during impact 
pile driving. However, in most cases, 
the duration of impact pile driving 
would be limited to the final stage of 
installation (proofing) after the pile has 
been driven as close as practicable to 
the design depth with a vibratory driver. 
In-water construction activities would 
only occur during daylight hours, 
allowing fish to forage and transit the 
project area in the evening. Vibratory 
pile driving could possibly elicit 
behavioral reactions from fishes, such as 
temporary avoidance of the area, but is 
unlikely to cause injuries to fishes or 
have persistent effects on local fish 
populations. Construction also would 
have minimal permanent and temporary 
impacts on benthic invertebrate species, 
a marine mammal prey source. In 
addition, it should be noted that the 
area in question is low-quality habitat 
since it is already highly developed and 
experiences a high level of 
anthropogenic noise from normal 
operations and other vessel traffic. 
Potential Effects on Foraging Habitat 
The proposed project is not expected 
to result in any habitat related effects 
that could cause significant or long-term 
negative consequences for individual 
marine mammals or their populations, 
since installation and removal of in- 
water piles would be temporary and 
intermittent. The total seafloor area 
affected by pile installation and removal 
is a very small area compared to the vast 
foraging area available to marine 
mammals outside this project area. For 
marine mammals, while the area is 
commonly used or traversed by some 
species, the proposed project area does 
not contain any particularly high-value 
habitat and is not usually important to 
any of the other species potentially 
affected by ADOT&PF’s proposed 
activities. While opportunistic foraging 
could occur, more foraging habitat is 
available outside the Bay, in more open 
ocean waters. Overall, the area impacted 
by the project is relatively small 
compared to the available habitat just 
outside the project area, and there are 
no areas of particular importance that 
would be impacted by this project 
during the period planned for activities 
to occur. Any behavioral avoidance by 
fish of the disturbed area would still 
leave significantly large areas of fish and 
marine mammal foraging habitat in the 
nearby vicinity. As described in the 
preceding, the potential for the 
ADOT&PF’s construction to affect the 
availability of prey to marine mammals 
or to meaningfully impact the quality of 
physical or acoustic habitat is 
considered insignificant. Therefore, 
impacts of the project are not likely to 
have adverse effects on marine mammal 
foraging habitat in the proposed project 
area. 
In summary, given the relatively small 
areas being affected, as well as the 
temporary and mostly transitory nature 
of the proposed construction activities, 
any adverse effects from ADOT&PF’s 
activities on prey habitat or prey 
populations are expected to be minor 
and temporary. The most likely impact 
to fishes at the project site would be 
temporary avoidance of the area. Any 
behavioral avoidance by fish of the 
disturbed area would still leave 
significantly large areas of fish and 
marine mammal foraging habitat in the 
nearby vicinity. Thus, we preliminarily 
conclude that impacts of the specified

than short-term adverse effects on any 
prey habitat or populations of prey 
species. Further, any impacts to marine 
mammal habitat are not expected to 
result in significant or long-term 
consequences for individual marine 
mammals, or to contribute to adverse 
impacts on their populations. 
Estimated Take of Marine Mammals 
This section provides an estimate of 
the number of incidental takes proposed 
for authorization through the IHA, 
which will inform NMFS’ consideration 
of ‘‘small numbers,’’ the negligible 
impact determinations, and impacts on 
subsistence uses. 
Harassment is the only type of take 
expected to result from these activities. 
Except with respect to certain activities 
not pertinent here, section 3(18) of the 
MMPA defines ‘‘harassment’’ as any act 
of pursuit, torment, or annoyance, 
which (i) has the potential to injure a 
marine mammal or marine mammal 
stock in the wild (Level A harassment); 
or (ii) has the potential to disturb a 
marine mammal or marine mammal 
stock in the wild by causing disruption 
of behavioral patterns, including, but 
not limited to, migration, breathing, 
nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering 
(Level B harassment). 
Authorized takes would primarily be 
by Level B harassment, as use of the 
acoustic sources (i.e., impact pile driving, vibratory pile driving) has the 
potential to result in disruption of 
behavioral patterns for individual 
marine mammals. There is also some 
potential for auditory injury (AUD INJ) 
(Level A harassment) to result, primarily 
for mysticetes, very high-frequency 
cetaceans, phocids, and otariids because 
predicted AUD INJ zones are larger than 
for high-frequency species. AUD INJ is 
unlikely to occur for high-frequency 
cetaceans. The proposed mitigation and 
monitoring measures are expected to 
minimize the severity of the taking to 
the extent practicable. 
As described previously, no serious 
injury or mortality is anticipated or 
proposed to be authorized for this 
activity. Below we describe how the 
proposed take numbers are estimated. 
For acoustic impacts, generally 
speaking, we estimate take by 
considering: (1) acoustic criteria above 
which NMFS believes there is some 
reasonable potential for marine 
mammals to be behaviorally harassed or 
incur some degree of AUD INJ; (2) the 
area or volume of water that would be 
ensonified above these levels in a day; 
(3) the density or occurrence of marine 
mammals within these ensonified areas; 
and, (4) the number of days of activities. 
We note that while these factors can 
contribute to a basic calculation to 
provide an initial prediction of potential 
takes, additional information that can 
qualitatively inform take estimates is 
also sometimes available (e.g., previous monitoring results or average group 
size). Below, we describe the factors 
considered here in more detail and 
present the proposed take estimates. 
Acoustic Criteria 
NMFS recommends the use of 
acoustic criteria that identify the 
received level of underwater sound 
above which exposed marine mammals 
would be reasonably expected to be 
behaviorally harassed (equated to Level 
B harassment) or to incur AUD INJ of 
some degree (equated to Level A 
harassment). We note that the criteria 
for AUD INJ, as well as the names of two 
hearing groups, have been recently 
updated (NMFS, 2024) as reflected 
below in the Level A harassment 
section. 
Level B Harassment—Though 
significantly driven by received level, 
the onset of behavioral disturbance from 
anthropogenic noise exposure is also 
informed to varying degrees by other 
factors related to the source or exposure 
context (e.g., frequency, predictability, duty cycle, duration of the exposure, 
signal-to-noise ratio, distance to the 
source), the environment (e.g., 
bathymetry, other noises in the area, 
predators in the area), and the receiving 
animals (hearing, motivation, 
experience, demography, life stage, 
depth) and can be difficult to predict 
(e.g., Southall et al., 2007, 2021, Ellison et al., 2012). Based on what the 
available science indicates and the 
practical need to use a threshold based 
on a metric that is both predictable and 
measurable for most activities, NMFS 
typically uses a generalized acoustic 
threshold based on received level to 
estimate the onset of behavioral 
harassment. NMFS generally predicts 
that marine mammals are likely to be 
behaviorally harassed in a manner 
considered to be Level B harassment 
when exposed to underwater 
anthropogenic noise above root-mean- 
squared pressure received levels (RMS 
SPL) of 120 dB (referenced to 1 
micropascal (re 1 mPa)) for continuous 
(e.g., vibratory pile driving, drilling) and above RMS SPL 160 dB re 1 mPa for non- 
explosive impulsive (e.g., seismic airguns) or intermittent (e.g., scientific sonar) sources. Generally speaking, 
Level B harassment take estimates based 
on these behavioral harassment 
thresholds are expected to include any 
likely takes by TTS as, in most cases, 
the likelihood of TTS occurs at 
distances from the source less than 
those at which behavioral harassment is 
likely. TTS of a sufficient degree can 
manifest as behavioral harassment, as 
reduced hearing sensitivity and the 
potential reduced opportunities to 
detect important signals (conspecific 
communication, predators, prey) may 
result in changes in behavior patterns 
that would not otherwise occur. 
ADOT&PF’s proposed pile driving 
includes the use of continuous 
(vibratory hammer) and impulsive 
(impact hammer) sources, and therefore 
the RMS SPL thresholds of 120 and 160 
dB re 1 mPa are applicable. 
Level A harassment—NMFS’ Updated 
Technical Guidance for Assessing the 
Effects of Anthropogenic Sound on 
Marine Mammal Hearing (Version 3.0) 
(Updated Technical Guidance, 2024) 
identifies dual criteria to assess AUD 
INJ (Level A harassment) to five 
different underwater marine mammal 
groups (based on hearing sensitivity) as 
a result of exposure to noise from two 
different types of sources (impulsive or 
non-impulsive). ADOT&PF’s proposed 
pile driving includes the use of 
impulsive (impact hammer) and non- 
impulsive (vibratory hammer) sources. 
The 2024 Updated Technical 
Guidance criteria include both updated 
thresholds and updated weighting 
functions for each hearing group (table 
6). The thresholds are provided in the 
table below. The references, analysis, 
and methodology used in the 
development of the criteria are 
described in NMFS’ 2024 Updated

Note: Peak sound pressure level (Lp,0-pk

) has a ref-
erence value of 1 µPa

s. In this table, criteria are abbreviated to be more reflective of International Organization for Standardization standards 
(ISO, 2017). The subscript ‘‘flat’’ is being included to indicate peak sound pressure are flat weighted or unweighted within the generalized hear-
ing range of marine mammals underwater (i.e., 7 Hz to 165 kHz). The subscript associated with cumulative sound exposure level criteria indi-cates the designated marine mammal auditory weighting function (LF, HF, and VHF cetaceans, and PW and OW pinnipeds) and that the rec-
ommended accumulation period is 24 hours. The weighted cumulative sound exposure level criteria could be exceeded in a multitude of ways 
(i.e., varying exposure levels and durations, duty cycle). When possible, it is valuable for action proponents to indicate the conditions under which these criteria will be exceeded. 
Ensonified Area 
Here, we describe operational and 
environmental parameters of the activity 
that are used in estimating the area 
ensonified above the acoustic 
thresholds, including source levels and 
transmission loss coefficient. 
The sound field in the project area is 
the existing background noise plus 
additional construction noise from the 
proposed project. Marine mammals are 
expected to be affected via sound 
generated by the primary components of 
the project (i.e., impact pile driving and vibratory pile driving). The source 
levels assumed for both removal and 
installation activities are based on 
reviews of measurements of the same or 
similar types and dimensions of piles 
available in the scientific literature and 
from similar coastal construction 
projects. Derived by the applicant using 
Geographic Information System 
software, the source levels for the piles 
and activities (i.e., installation and/or removal), and the information and 
literature used to determine appropriate 
proxy sources, where applicable, are 
presented in table 7. The source levels 
for vibratory removal and installation of 
piles of the same material and diameter 
are assumed to be the same.

Level B Harassment 
Transmission Loss (TL) is the 
decrease in acoustic intensity as an 
acoustic pressure wave propagates out 
from a source. TL parameters vary with frequency, temperature, sea conditions, 
current, source and receiver depth, 
water depth, water chemistry, and 
bottom composition and topography. 
The general formula for underwater TL 
is: 
TL = B × Log10
(R1/R2), 
Where: 
TL = transmission loss in dB, B = transmission loss coefficient, R1 = the distance of the modeled SPL from the driven pile, and 
R2 = the distance from the driven pile of the initial measurement. 
This formula neglects loss due to 
scattering and absorption, which is 
assumed to be zero in this case. The 
degree to which underwater sound 
propagates away from a sound source 
depends on various factors, most 
notably the water bathymetry and the 
presence or absence of reflective or 
absorptive conditions, including in- 
water structures and sediments. 
Spherical spreading occurs in a 
perfectly unobstructed (free-field) 
environment not limited by depth or 
water surface, resulting in a 6 dB 
reduction in sound level for each 
doubling of distance from the source 
(20*log
10
[range]). Cylindrical spreading 
occurs in an environment in which 
sound propagation is bounded by the 
water surface and sea bottom, resulting 
in a reduction of 3 dB in sound level for 
each doubling of distance from the 
source (10*log
10
[range]). A practical 
spreading value of 15 is often used 
under conditions where water increases 
with depth as the receiver moves away 
from the shoreline, resulting in an 
expected propagation environment that 
would lie between spherical and 
cylindrical spreading loss conditions. 
Absent site-specific acoustic monitoring 
with differing measured TL, practical spreading is used. Site-specific TL data for Cold Bay is not available; therefore, 
the default coefficient of 15 is used to 
determine the distances to the Level A 
harassment and Level B harassment 
thresholds. 
Level A Harassment 
The ensonified area associated with 
Level A harassment is more technically 
challenging to predict due to the need 
to account for a duration component. 
Therefore, NMFS developed an optional 
User Spreadsheet tool to accompany the 
2024 Updated Technical Guidance that 
can be used to relatively simply predict 
an isopleth distance for use in 
conjunction with marine mammal 
density or occurrence to help predict 
potential takes (found on our website 
here: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/ 
marine-mammal-acoustic-technical- 
guidance-other-acoustic-tools). 
We note that because of some of the 
assumptions included in the methods 
underlying this optional tool, we 
anticipate that the resulting isopleth 
estimates are typically going to be 
overestimates of some degree, which 
may result in an overestimate of 
potential take by Level A harassment. 
However, this optional tool offers the 
best way to estimate isopleth distances 
when more sophisticated modeling 
methods are not available or practical. 
For stationary sources, such as vibratory 
pile driving and impact pile driving, the 
optional User Spreadsheet tool predicts 
the distance at which, if a marine 
mammal remained at that distance for 
the duration of the activity, it would be 
expected to incur AUD INJ. Inputs used 
in the optional User Spreadsheet tool, 
and the resulting estimated isopleths, 
are reported below in tables 8 and 9. 
Using the practical spreading model, 
NMFS determined that the underwater 
noise would yield the calculated 
distances to the Level A harassment and 
Level B harassment thresholds for 
marine mammals shown in table 10.

It should be noted that, based on the 
geography of Cold Bay and the 
surrounding islands outside of the 
mouth of the Bay, the sound would not 
reach the entire distance of the Level B 
harassment isopleths. The size and 
shape of the Bay are expected to 
truncate the largest Level B harassment 
isopleths. 
Marine Mammal Occurrence and Take 
Estimation 
In this section, we provide 
information about the occurrence of 
marine mammals, including density or 
other relevant information, which will 
inform the take calculations. Then, we 
describe how all of the information 
detailed above is synthesized to produce 
a quantitative estimate of the take that 
is reasonably likely to occur and 
proposed for authorization. 
In their ITA application, ADOT&PF 
calculated their requested take based on 
the synthetization of different resources, 
including websites from state and 
Federal agencies (i.e., Alaska Department of Fish & Game, NMFS, U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service), data from 
aerial survey performed by the National 
Marine Mammal Laboratory, 
information gleaned from scientific 
literature (i.e., Zerbini et al., 2007, Rone et al., 2017, and McInnes et al., 2024b), 
and information from non-profits (i.e., 
iNaturalist) with both relevant species- 
specific and site-specific information. 
Given the secluded and sheltered nature 
of Cold Bay’s geographic location, these 
resources provide the most appropriate 
information for which to determine 
estimated species densities/occurrences 
and group sizes. 
Estimated take was calculated 
different for each species, depending on 
the likely occurrence of the species in 
the proposed project area (see table 11). 
This means that some occurrences were 
calculated on a daily basis, some on a 
weekly, or some on a monthly (or multi- 
monthly) basis. This is all assumed to 
occur within 231 days of project 
activities requiring the use of in-water 
pile driving, consisting of both vibratory 
and impact approaches, which can vary 
in total number of days based on the 
specific construction activity. 
TABLE11—ESTIMATEDSPECIESOCCURRENCE 
Species Abundance estimate assumed Estimated occurrence Humpback whale ............................... Group size of 2 individuals per month ......................................................... 0.067a
per workday. 
Gray whale ........................................ Group size of 5.7 individuals per 3 months ................................................. 0.03 per workday. 
Killer whale ........................................ Group size of 3 individuals per group, assuming 1 group per week .......... 0.43 per workday. 
Harbor porpoise ................................. Group size of 3 individuals per week .......................................................... 0.43 per workday. 
Steller sea lion ................................... Group size of 15 individuals per day ........................................................... 15. Harbor seal ........................................ Group size of 10 individuals per day ........................................................... 10. a
This was assumed for the entire species and then, based on NMFS (2021), was split further for each stock/Distinct Population Segment (DPS). 
After reviewing the available 
resources to determine an appropriate 
occurrence level (i.e., daily, weekly, monthly, multi-monthly) and group 
size, these were multiplied together to 
yield the overall estimated take 
(combined Level A harassment and 
Level B harassment). These were then 
split using two different methods. 
Potential takes by Level A harassment 
were calculated if 1) some of the Level 
A harassment zones were estimated to 
exceed the practicable shutdown zone 
for a given hearing group, or 2) if the 
species could be difficult to see due to 
its small size or cryptic behavior. To 
calculate the proposed takes by Level A 
harassment, ‘‘areal calculations’’ were 
performed for three species (Steller sea 
lion, harbor seal, and harbor porpoise) 
where the calculated area of each 
hearing group’s Level A harassment 
zone was divided by the area of the 
largest predicted Level B harassment

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60674 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices zone to result in an ‘‘areal percentage’’. 
This was then multiplied by both the 
number of days determined necessary to 
complete the construction task and then 
by unique species occurrence. To 
calculate the number of estimated takes 
proposed for authorization by Level B 
harassment, the calculated takes by 
Level A harassment were subtracted 
from the total number of calculated 
takes, with the remaining assumed to be 
taken by Level B harassment only. 
Humpback whales are common in the 
general region during the summer 
months; however, their presence within 
the project area is uncommon due to the 
shallow and sheltered nature of Cold 
Bay. Given that all work and noise are 
expected to be confined to the Bay, but 
in some cases, exceed the practicable 
shutdown zone, NMFS proposes to 
conservatively authorize two groups of 
two humpback whales for take by Level 
A harassment. 
More specific information on species/ 
stock occurrence, which was 
incorporated into the analysis, can be 
found in section 6 of ADOT&PF’s 
application and is not repeated here; 
instead, we reference the reader to the 
application for this additional 
information. Below, we provide the 
areal calculations (table 12), and we 
summarize the relevant group sizes and 
information presented on the 
occurrence of each species/stock and 
provide the numerical values proposed 
for authorization in the table below

Proposed percentage to be taken refers to combined take by both Level B harassment and Level A harassment (where requested) for each individual species/ 
stock. If there is more than one stock of a species, the percent of stock is also calculated as if all takes occurred to a single stock.

Although different stocks of humpback whales could be present, PSOs would likely be unable to identify to the stock-level. Given this, NMFS will count any takes 
for humpback whales as a single group, not by stocks.

I  I I  I  I 60675 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices Proposed Mitigation 
In order to issue an IHA under section 
101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA, NMFS must 
set forth the permissible methods of 
taking pursuant to the activity, and 
other means of effecting the least 
practicable impact on the species or 
stock and its habitat, paying particular 
attention to rookeries, mating grounds, 
and areas of similar significance, and on 
the availability of the species or stock 
for taking for certain subsistence. NMFS 
regulations require applicants for 
incidental take authorizations (ITA) to 
include information about the 
availability and feasibility (economic 
and technological) of equipment, 
methods, and manner of conducting the 
activity or other means of effecting the 
least practicable adverse impact upon 
the affected species or stocks, and their 
habitat (50 CFR 216.104(a)(11)). 
In evaluating how mitigation may or 
may not be appropriate to ensure the 
least practicable adverse impact on 
species or stocks and their habitat, as 
well as subsistence uses where 
applicable, NMFS considers two 
primary factors: 
(1) The manner in which, and the 
degree to which, the successful 
implementation of the measure(s) is 
expected to reduce impacts to marine 
mammals, marine mammal species or 
stocks, and their habitat, as well as 
subsistence uses. This considers the 
nature of the potential adverse impact 
being mitigated (likelihood, scope, 
range). It further considers the 
likelihood that the measure will be 
effective if implemented (probability of 
accomplishing the mitigating result if 
implemented as planned), the 
likelihood of effective implementation 
(probability implemented as planned), 
and; 
(2) The practicability of the measures 
for applicant implementation, which 
may consider such things as cost, and 
impact on operations. 
The mitigation requirements 
described in the following were 
proposed by ADOT&PF in its adequate 
and complete application or are the 
result of subsequent coordination 
between NMFS and ADOT&PF. 
ADOT&PF has agreed that all of the 
mitigation measures are practicable. 
NMFS has fully reviewed the specified 
activities and the mitigation measures to 
determine if the mitigation measures 
would result in the least practicable 
adverse impact on marine mammals and 
their habitat, as required by the MMPA, 
and has determined the proposed 
measures are appropriate. NMFS 
describes these below as proposed 
mitigation requirements and has 
included them in the proposed IHA. 
In addition to the measures described 
later in this section, ADOT&PF would 
be required to follow these general 
mitigation measures: 
€Takes proposed for authorization, by Level A harassment and Level B 
harassment only, would be limited to 
the species and numbers listed in table 
14. Construction activities would be 
required to be halted upon observation 
of either a species for which incidental 
take was not authorized or for a species 
for which incidental take has been 
authorized but the number of takes has 
been met, entering or is within the 
harassment zone, if the IHA is issued. 
€The taking by serious injury or death of any of the species listed in 
table 14 or any taking of any other 
species of marine mammal would be 
prohibited and would result in the 
modification, suspension, or revocation 
of the IHA, if issued. Any taking 
exceeding the amounts proposed for 
authorization listed in table 14 would be 
prohibited and would result in the 
modification, suspension, or revocation 
of the IHA, if issued; 
€Ensure that construction supervisors and crews, the marine 
mammal monitoring team, and relevant 
ADOT&PF staff are trained prior to the 
start of all construction activities, so 
that responsibilities, communication 
procedures, marine mammal monitoring 
protocol, and operational procedures are 
clearly understood. New personnel 
joining during the project must be 
trained prior to commencing work; 
€ADOT&PF, construction supervisors and crews, PSOs, and 
relevant ADOT&PF staff must avoid 
direct physical interaction with marine 
mammals during construction activities. 
If a marine mammal comes within 10 m 
(32.8 ft) of such activity, operations 
must cease and vessels must reduce 
speed to the minimum level required to 
maintain steerage and safe working 
conditions, as necessary to avoid direct 
physical interaction; 
€Employ PSOs and establish monitoring locations as described in the 
Protected Species Monitoring and 
Mitigation Plan (PSMMP) (see NMFS’ 
website). ADOT&PF must monitor the 
project area to the maximum extent 
possible based on the required number 
of PSOs, required monitoring locations, 
and environmental conditions; 
€ADOT&PF also would abide by the reasonable and prudent measures and 
terms and conditions of a Biological 
Opinion and Incidental Take Statement, 
if issued by NMFS, pursuant to Section 
7 of the ESA; and 
€ADOT&PF, in alignment with the PSMMP, would abide by vessel 
measures related to North Pacific right 
whales (50 CFR 224.103(c)), Steller sea 
lions (50 CFR 224.103(d)), and 
humpback whales (50 CFR 224.103(b), 
50 CFR 223.214). 
Additionally, the following mitigation 
measures apply to ADOT&PF’s in-water 
construction activities. 
Pre- and Post-Activity Monitoring 
ADOT&PF would be required to 
establish pre- and post-monitoring 
zones with radial distances (based on 
the distances to the Level B harassment 
threshold and feasibility for PSOs in the 
field) for all construction activities (see 
table 14). Monitoring would take place 
from 30 minutes prior to initiation of 
any pile driving activity (i.e., pre-start clearance monitoring) through 30 
minutes post-completion of pile driving 
activity. In addition, monitoring for 30 
minutes would take place whenever a 
break in the specified activity (i.e., 
impact pile driving, vibratory pile 
driving) of 30 minutes or longer occurs. 
Pre-start clearance monitoring would be 
conducted during periods of visibility 
sufficient for the Lead PSO to determine 
that the shutdown zones (indicated 
further below) are clear of marine 
mammals. Pile driving may commence 
following 30 minutes of observation 
when the determination is made that the 
shutdown zones are clear of marine 
mammals.

a
Monitoring zones are measured from shore (where PSOs would be located) outward from each monitoring station. 
Soft-Start 
ADOT&PF would use soft start 
techniques when impact pile driving. 
Soft-start requires contractors to provide 
an initial set of three strikes at reduced 
energy, followed by a 30-second waiting 
period, then two subsequent reduced- 
energy strike sets. A soft-start would be 
implemented at the start of each day’s 
impact pile driving and at any time 
following cessation of impact pile 
driving for a period of 30 minutes or 
longer. Soft-start procedures are used to 
provide additional protection to marine 
mammals by providing warning and/or 
giving marine mammals a chance to 
leave the area prior to the hammer 
operating at full capacity. 
Establishment of Shutdown Zones 
ADOT&PF would be required to 
establish shutdown zones with radial 
distances, as identified in table 15 for all 
construction activities. The purpose of a 
shutdown zone is generally to define an 
area within which shutdown of the 
activity would occur upon sighting of a 
marine mammal (or in anticipation of an 
animal entering the defined area). 
Additionally, ADOT&PF would be 
required to shutdown in the event an 
unauthorized species is present, to 
avoid take of that unauthorized species. 
Shutdown zones would vary based on 
the activity type and marine mammal 
hearing group. 
If a marine mammal is observed 
entering or within the shutdown zones 
indicated in table 15, pile driving 
activities must be delayed or halted. If 
pile driving is delayed or halted due to 
the presence of a marine mammal, the 
activity may not commence or resume 
until either the animal has voluntarily 
exited and been visually confirmed 
beyond the shutdown zones or a 
specific time period has passed without 
re-detection of the animal (i.e., 30 minutes for cetaceans, 15 minutes for 
pinnipeds). If a marine mammal comes 
within or approaches the shutdown 
zone indicated in table 15, such 
operations must cease.

A minimum shutdown zone of 10 m (32.8 ft) would be enforced to ensure animals are not endangered by any physical interaction with the 
construction equipment (i.e., barge positioning operations, the positioning of piles via a crane (‘‘stabbing’’ the pile), the removal of piles via a crane (deadpull), or the overwater slinging of construction materials). 
b
While NMFS acknowledges that the Level A harassment zones are larger than the 2,000-meter monitoring zone, NMFS considers 2,000 me-
ters a practicable shutdown zone distance for LF cetaceans. 
c
NMFS notes that this value was original 940 m (3,084 ft); however, given the size of Steller sea lions, NMFS suggested and the applicant ac-
cepted, a more realistic shutdown zone for 300 m (984.3 ft) for these activities. 
d
NMFS notes that this value was original 1,320 m (4,330.7 ft); however, given the size of Steller sea lions, NMFS suggested and the applicant 
accepted, a more realistic shutdown zone for 300 m (984.3 ft) for these activities. 
Bubble Curtain 
ADOT&PF has not proposed, to utilize 
a bubble curtain during any of the 
proposed pile driving activities 
presented herein due to feasibility 
concerns related to the costs and time 
necessary to install and operate the 
curtains. Time delays are impractical for 
the proposed project due to the short 
field season available in the extreme 
environment of the Aleutian Islands. 
NMFS conducted an independent 
evaluation of the proposed measures, 
and has preliminarily determined that 
the proposed mitigation measures 
provide the means of effecting the least 
practicable impact on the affected 
species or stocks and their habitat, 
paying particular attention to rookeries, 
mating grounds, areas of similar 
significance, and on the availability of 
such species or stock for subsistence 
uses. 
Proposed Monitoring and Reporting 
In order to issue an IHA for an 
activity, section 101(a)(5)(D) of the 
MMPA states that NMFS must set forth 
requirements pertaining to the 
monitoring and reporting of such taking. 
The MMPA implementing regulations at 
50 CFR 216.104(a)(13) indicate that 
requests for authorizations must include 
the suggested means of accomplishing 
the necessary monitoring and reporting 
that will result in increased knowledge 
of the species and of the level of taking 
or impacts on populations of marine 
mammals that are expected to be 
present while conducting the activities. 
Effective reporting is critical both to 
compliance as well as ensuring that the 
most value is obtained from the required 
monitoring. 
Monitoring and reporting 
requirements prescribed by NMFS 
should contribute to improved 
understanding of one or more of the 
following: 
€Occurrence of marine mammal species or stocks in the area in which 
take is anticipated (e.g., presence, abundance, distribution, density); 
€Nature, scope, or context of likely marine mammal exposure to potential 
stressors/impacts (individual or 
cumulative, acute or chronic), through 
better understanding of: (1) action or 
environment (e.g., source characterization, propagation, ambient 
noise); (2) affected species (e.g., life history, dive patterns); (3) co-occurrence 
of marine mammal species with the 
activity; or (4) biological or behavioral 
context of exposure (e.g., age, calving or feeding areas); 
€Individual marine mammal responses (behavioral or physiological) 
to acoustic stressors (acute, chronic, or 
cumulative), other stressors, or 
cumulative impacts from multiple 
stressors; 
€How anticipated responses to stressors impact either: (1) long-term 
fitness and survival of individual 
marine mammals; or (2) populations, 
species, or stocks; 
€Effects on marine mammal habitat (e.g., marine mammal prey species, acoustic habitat, or other important 
physical components of marine 
mammal habitat); and 
€Mitigation and monitoring effectiveness. 
ADOT&PF would abide by all 
monitoring and reporting measures 
contained within the IHA, if issued, and 
their PSMMP (see NMFS’ website). The 
monitoring and reporting requirements 
described in the following were 
proposed by ADOT&PF in its adequate 
and complete application and/or are the 
result of subsequent coordination 
between NMFS and ADOT&PF. 
ADOT&PF has agreed to the 
requirements. NMFS describes these 
below as requirements and has included 
them in the proposed IHA.

All PSOs must be NMFS-approved. 
PSOs would be independent of the 
activity contractor (for example, 
employed by a subcontractor) and have 
no other assigned tasks during 
monitoring periods. At least one PSO 
would have prior experience performing 
the duties of a PSO during an activity 
pursuant to a NMFS-issued ITA. Other 
PSOs may substitute other relevant 
experience (including relevant Alaska 
Native traditional knowledge), 
education (degree in biological science 
or related field), or training for prior 
experience performing the duties of a 
PSO during construction activity 
pursuant to a NMFS-issued ITA. 
Additionally, PSOs would be required 
to meet the following qualifications: 
€The ability to conduct field observations and collect data according 
to assigned protocols; 
€Experience or training in the field identification of marine mammals, 
including the identification of 
behaviors; 
€Sufficient training, orientation, or experience with the construction 
operation to provide for personal safety 
during observations; 
€Writing skills sufficient to prepare a report of observations including but not 
limited to: 
(1) Number and species of marine 
mammals observed; 
(2) Dates and times when in-water 
construction activities were conducted; 
(3) Dates, times, and reason for 
implementation of mitigation (or why 
mitigation was not implemented when 
required); and 
(4) Marine mammal behavior. 
€The ability to communicate orally, by radio or in person, with project 
personnel to provide real-time 
information on marine mammals 
observed in the area as necessary. 
ADOT&PF must establish monitoring 
locations, as described in PSMMP (see 
NMFS’ website). ADOT&PF must use a 
minimum of two PSOs. Where a team of 
three or more PSOs is required, a lead 
observer (‘‘Lead PSO’’) or monitoring 
coordinator would be designated. The 
lead observer must have prior 
experience performing the duties of a 
PSO during construction activity 
pursuant to a NMFS-issued ITA or 
Letter of Concurrence. 
For all pile driving activities, a 
minimum of one PSO must be assigned 
to each active pile driving location to 
monitor the applicable shutdown zones 
for the entirety of active construction 
operations (see PSMMP). Given the 
maximum effective observation 
distance, PSOs would be required to 
continuously monitor the entirety of the 
shutdown zones and as much as 
possible of the Level B harassment 
zones given visibility constraints, using 
binoculars and other resources to aid in 
observation. At all locations, all PSOs, 
to the extent practicable, must use an 
elevator platform at observation points 
to enhance observation ability. PSOs 
would be required to record all 
observations of marine mammals, 
regardless of distance from the pile 
being driven, as well as the additional 
data indicated below and in section 6 of 
the IHA, if issued. 
Proposed Reporting 
ADOT&PF would be required to 
submit an annual draft summary report 
on all construction activities and marine 
mammal monitoring results to NMFS 
within 90 days following the end of 
construction or 60 calendar days prior 
to the requested issuance of any 
subsequent IHA for similar activity at 
the same location, whichever comes 
first. The draft summary report would 
include an overall description of 
construction work completed, a 
narrative regarding marine mammal 
sightings, and associated raw PSO data 
sheets (in electronic spreadsheet 
format). Specifically, the report must 
include: 
€Dates and times (begin and end) of all marine mammal monitoring; 
€Construction activities occurring during each daily observation period, 
including: (a) how many and what type 
of piles were driven or removed and the 
method (i.e., impact and vibratory); and (b) the total duration of time for each 
pile (vibratory driving) or number of 
strikes for each pile (impact driving); 
€PSO locations during marine mammal monitoring; and 
€Environmental conditions during monitoring periods (at beginning and 
end of PSO shift and whenever 
conditions change significantly), 
including Beaufort sea state and any 
other relevant weather conditions 
including cloud cover, fog, sun glare, 
and overall visibility to the horizon, and 
estimated observable distance. 
Upon observation of a marine 
mammal, the following information 
must be reported: 
€Name of PSO who sighted the animal(s) and PSO location and activity 
at the time of the sighting; 
€Time of the sighting; €Identification of the animal(s) (e.g., genus/species, lowest possible 
taxonomic level, or unidentified), PSO 
confidence in identification, and the 
composition of the group if there is a 
mix of species; 
€Distance and bearing of each observed marine mammal relative to the 
pile being driven or removed for each 
sighting; 
€Estimated number of animals (min/ max/best estimate); 
€Estimated number of animals by cohort (e.g., adults, juveniles, neonates, group composition, etc.); 
€Animal’s closest point of approach and estimated time spent within the 
estimated harassment zone(s); 
€Description of any marine mammal behavioral observations (e.g., observed behaviors such as feeding or traveling), 
including an assessment of behavioral 
responses thought to have resulted from 
the activity (e.g., no response or changes in behavioral state such as ceasing 
feeding, changing direction, flushing, or 
breaching); 
€Number of marine mammals detected within the estimated 
harassment zones, by species; and 
€Detailed information about implementation of any mitigation (e.g., 
shutdowns and delays), a description of 
specified actions that occurred, and 
resulting changes in behavior of the 
animal(s), if any. 
If no comments are received from 
NMFS within 30 days after the 
submission of the draft summary report, 
the draft report would constitute the 
final report. If ADOT&PF received 
comments from NMFS, a final summary 
report addressing NMFS’ comments 
would be submitted within 30 days after 
receipt of comments. 
Reporting Injured or Dead Marine 
Mammals 
In the event that personnel involved 
in ADOT&PF’s activities discover an 
injured or dead marine mammal, 
ADOT&PF would report the incident to 
the NMFS Office of Protected Resources 
(OPR) (PR.ITP.MonitoringReports@
noaa.gov, ITP.Potlock@noaa.gov) and to the Alaska Regional Stranding 
Coordinator (877–925–7773) as soon as 
feasible. If the death or injury was 
clearly caused by the specified activity, 
ADOT&PF would immediately cease the 
specified activities until NMFS is able 
to review the circumstances of the 
incident and determine what, if any, 
additional measures are appropriate to 
ensure compliance with the IHA. 
ADOT&PF would not resume their 
activities until notified by NMFS. The 
report would include the following 
information: 
€Description of the incident; €Environmental conditions (e.g., Beaufort sea state, visibility); 
€Description of all marine mammal observations in the 24 hours preceding 
the incident;

€Condition of the animal(s) (including carcass condition if the 
animal is dead); 
€Observed behaviors of the animal(s), if alive; and 
€General circumstances under which the animal was discovered. 
Negligible Impact Analysis and 
Determination 
NMFS has defined negligible impact 
as an impact resulting from the 
specified activity that cannot be 
reasonably expected to, and is not 
reasonably likely to, adversely affect the 
species or stock through effects on 
annual rates of recruitment or survival 
(50 CFR 216.103). A negligible impact 
finding is based on the lack of likely 
adverse effects on annual rates of 
recruitment or survival (i.e., population- level effects). An estimate of the number 
of takes alone is not enough information 
on which to base an impact 
determination. In addition to 
considering estimates of the number of 
marine mammals that might be ‘‘taken’’ 
through harassment, NMFS considers 
other factors, such as the likely nature 
of any impacts or responses (e.g., 
intensity, duration), the context of any 
impacts or responses (e.g., critical reproductive time or location, foraging 
impacts affecting energetics), as well as 
effects on habitat, and the likely 
effectiveness of the mitigation. We also 
assess the number, intensity, and 
context of estimated takes by evaluating 
this information relative to population 
status. Consistent with the 1989 
preamble for NMFS’ implementing 
regulations (54 FR 40338, September 29, 
1989), the impacts from other past and 
ongoing anthropogenic activities are 
incorporated into this analysis via their 
impacts on the baseline (e.g., as reflected in the regulatory status of the 
species, population size and growth rate 
where known, ongoing sources of 
human-caused mortality, or ambient 
noise levels). 
To avoid repetition, the discussion of 
our analysis applies to all of the species 
listed in table 3, given that the 
anticipated effects of this activity on 
these different marine mammal stocks 
are expected to be similar. There is little 
information about the nature or severity 
of the impacts, or the size, status, or 
structure of any of these species or 
stocks that would lead to a different 
analysis for these activities. 
Impact pile driving for installation 
and vibratory pile driving for 
installation and/or removal activities 
associated with the proposed project, as 
outlined previously, have the potential 
to disturb or displace marine mammals. 
Specifically, the specified activities may 
result in take in the form of Level A 
harassment and/or Level B harassment 
from underwater sounds generated from 
pile driving installation and removal. 
Potential takes could occur if 
individuals of these species are present 
in zones ensonified above the 
thresholds for Level A harassment or 
Level B harassment identified above 
when these activities are underway. 
Given the nature of the proposed 
activities, NMFS does not anticipate 
serious injury or mortality due to 
ADOT&PF’s proposed project, even in 
the absence of required mitigation. The 
Level A harassment zones identified in 
table 10 are based upon an animal 
exposed to vibratory pile driving and/or 
impact pile driving for periods ranging 
from 20 to 60 minutes for in-water pile 
driving per day. Overall, construction 
activities are not expected to exceed 12 
hours per day (likely ranging between 
10–12 hours but not all of that would be 
spent actively pile driving). Exposures 
of this length are, however, unlikely for 
vibratory driving for installation and/or 
removal, given marine mammal 
movement throughout the area. Even 
during impact driving scenarios, an 
animal exposed to the accumulated 
sound energy would likely only 
experience limited AUD INJ at the lower 
frequencies where pile driving energy is 
concentrated. 
As stated in the Proposed Mitigation 
section, ADOT&PF would implement 
shutdown zones that equal or exceed 
many of the Level A harassment 
isopleths shown in table 15. Take by 
Level A harassment is proposed for five 
marine mammal species/stocks. This is 
precautionary to account for the 
potential that an animal could enter and 
remain within the area between a Level 
A harassment zone and the shutdown 
zone for long enough to be taken by 
Level A harassment. Additionally, in 
some cases, this precaution would 
account for the possibility that an 
animal could enter a shutdown zone 
without detection and remain in the 
Level A harassment zone for a duration 
long enough to be taken by Level A 
harassment before being observed and a 
shutdown occurring. That said, any take 
by Level A harassment is expected to 
arise from, at most, a small degree of 
AUD INJ because animals would need to 
be exposed to higher levels and/or 
longer duration than are expected to 
occur here to incur any more than a 
small degree of AUD INJ. Given the 
proximity to shore and the secluded 
nature of the Bay, exposure over 
extended periods of time are not 
considered likely to occur before the 
animal is observed by PSOs and the 
proposed mitigation measures are 
implemented. Additionally, and as 
noted previously, some subset of the 
individuals that are behaviorally 
harassed could also simultaneously 
incur some small degree of TTS for a 
short duration of time. Because of the 
small degree anticipated, any AUD INJ 
or TTS potentially incurred here is not 
expected to adversely affect an animal’s 
individual fitness, let alone annual rates 
of recruitment or survival. 
For all species and stocks, take is 
expected to occur within a limited, 
confined area (adjacent to the project 
site) of the stock’s range. The intensity 
and duration of take by Level A 
harassment and Level B harassment 
would be expected to be minimized 
through the proposed mitigation 
measures described herein. 
Furthermore, the amount of take 
proposed for authorization is small 
compared to the relative stock’s 
abundance, even assuming that every 
take for any particular species could 
wholly occur to individuals of an 
individual stock (where estimates of the 
stocks population are available). 
Behavioral responses of marine 
mammals to pile driving for pile 
installation and/or pile removal at the 
project site, if any, are expected to be 
mild, short-term, and temporary. Given 
that old piles would be removed, 
temporary piles would be installed and 
then subsequently removed, and new 
piles would be permanently installed 
over 231 days in total (not necessarily 
be consecutive) over 10 to 12 hours per 
day, any harassment is expected to be 
temporary and intermittent. Marine 
mammals within the Level B 
harassment zones may not show any 
visual cues they are disturbed by 
activities or they could become alert, 
avoid the area, leave the area, or display 
other mild responses that are not 
observable, such as changes in 
vocalization patterns. Additionally, 
many of the species present in this 
region would only be present 
temporarily based on seasonal patterns 
or during active transit between other 
habitats. Most likely, during pile 
driving, individuals would be expected 
to move away from the sound source 
and be temporarily displaced from the 
areas of pile driving throughout the 
duration of pile driving activities. 
However, this reaction has been

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60680 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices observed primarily associated with 
impact pile driving. While vibratory 
driving associated with the proposed 
project may produce sound at distances 
of many kilometers from the project site, 
thus overlapping with some likely less- 
disturbed habitat, the project site itself 
is located in a busy harbor, and the 
majority of sound fields produced by 
the specified activities are close to the 
harbor. Animals disturbed by project 
sounds would be expected to avoid the 
area and use nearby higher-quality 
habitats. Pinnipeds in the area would 
have the ability to haul-out on 
shorelines and floating structures to 
avoid the activities (noting that the only 
regular haul-outs are located much 
further away from the project area) and 
no additional in-air harassment is 
anticipated from the construction 
activities. 
The potential for harassment is 
minimized by implementing the 
proposed mitigation measures. During 
all impact driving, implementation of 
soft-start procedures and monitoring of 
established shutdown zones by trained 
and qualified PSOs shall be required, 
significantly reducing any possibility of 
injury. Given sufficient notice through 
soft-start (for impact driving), marine 
mammals are expected to move away 
from an irritating sound source before it 
becomes potentially injurious. 
Any impacts on marine mammal prey 
that would occur during ADOT&PF’s 
proposed activities would have, at most, 
short-term effects on foraging of 
individual marine mammals, and likely 
no effect on the populations of marine 
mammals as a whole. Indirect effects on 
marine mammal prey during the 
construction are expected to be minor, 
and these effects are unlikely to cause 
substantial effects on marine mammals 
at the individual level, with no expected 
effect on annual rates of recruitment or 
survival. 
The area likely impacted by the 
project is relatively small compared to 
the available habitat in the surrounding 
waters of the Aleutian Islands. Although 
the Aleutian Islands are part of several 
identified BIAs (i.e., fin whale, gray whale, humpback whale, North Pacific 
right whale, and sperm whale), none of 
the BIAs themselves enter the Bay 
(NOAA, 2023; Wild et al., 2023). As all 
sound produced from the proposed 
activity is not expected to leave the 
mouth of the Bay, NMFS does not 
expect any spatial overlap with the 
proposed timing of the in-water 
construction. 
In addition, it is unlikely that minor 
noise effects in a small, localized area of 
habitat would have any effect on the 
reproduction or survival of any 
individuals, much less the stocks’ 
annual rates of recruitment or survival. 
In combination, we believe that these 
factors, as well as the available body of 
evidence from other similar activities, 
demonstrate that the potential effects of 
the specified activities would have only 
minor, short-term effects on individuals. 
As already said, the specified activities 
are not expected to impact rates of 
recruitment or survival; therefore, these 
effects would not be expected to result 
in population-level impacts. 
In summary and as described above, 
the following factors primarily support 
our preliminary determination that the 
impacts resulting from this activity are 
not expected to adversely affect any of 
the species or stocks through effects on 
annual rates of recruitment or survival: 
€No serious injury or mortality is anticipated or proposed for 
authorization; 
€Any Level A harassment exposures are anticipated to result in slight AUD 
INJ (i.e., of a few decibels) within the lower frequencies associated with pile 
driving; 
€The anticipated incidents of Level B harassment would consist of, at worst, 
temporary modifications in behavior 
that would not result in fitness impacts 
to individuals; 
€The area affected by the specified activity is very small relative to the 
overall habitat ranges of all species, 
does not include any rookeries, and 
does not spatially overlap with any 
BIAs; 
€Effects on species that serve as prey for marine mammals from the activities 
are expected to be short-term and, 
therefore, any associated impacts on 
marine mammal feeding are not 
expected to result in significant or long- 
term consequences for individuals, or to 
accrue to adverse impacts on their 
populations; 
€There are no known haulout locations for Steller sea lions near the 
proposed project site; 
€While harbor seals are known to haul out near the mouth of Kinzarof 
Lagoon (located approximately 4.5 mi 
(7.2 km) from the City of Cold Bay’s 
coastal infrastructure, at the closest 
point), all activities are occurring in- 
water, and any harbor seals hauled out 
would not be expected to be affected by 
in-water noise. Any seals in the water 
would have the ability to surface as this 
in-air habitat is expected to be 
unaffected at distance by the proposed 
in-water activities; 
€The project area is located in an industrialized and commercial dock; 
and 
€The proposed mitigation measures, such as employing vibratory driving to 
the maximum extent practicable, soft- 
starts, and shutdowns, are expected to 
reduce the effects of the specified 
activity to the least practicable adverse 
impact level. 
Based on the analysis contained 
herein of the likely effects of the 
specified activity on marine mammals 
and their habitat, and taking into 
consideration the implementation of the 
proposed monitoring and mitigation 
measures, NMFS preliminarily finds 
that the total marine mammal take from 
the proposed activity would have a 
negligible impact on all affected marine 
mammal species or stocks. 
Small Numbers 
As noted previously, only take of 
small numbers of marine mammals may 
be authorized under section 101(a)(5)(A) 
and (D) of the MMPA for specified 
activities other than military readiness 
activities. The MMPA does not define 
small numbers and so, in practice, 
where estimated numbers are available, 
NMFS compares the number of 
individuals taken to the most 
appropriate estimation of abundance of 
the relevant species or stock in our 
determination of whether an 
authorization is limited to small 
numbers of marine mammals. When the 
predicted number of individuals to be 
taken is fewer than one-third of the 
species or stock abundance, the take is 
considered to be of small numbers (86 
FR 5322, January 19, 2021). 
Additionally, other qualitative factors 
may be considered in the analysis, such 
as the temporal or spatial scale of the 
activities. 
NMFS is proposing to authorize 
incidental take by Level A harassment 
and/or Level B harassment of six species 
(eight stocks) of marine mammals. No 
mortality or serious injury has been 
requested, nor is it anticipated to occur 
from the activities described herein. The 
maximum number of instances of takes 
by Level A harassment and/or Level B 
harassment, relative to the best available 
population abundance, is less than one- 
third for all species and stocks 
potentially impacted (see table 13). 
Based on the analysis contained 
herein of the proposed activity 
(including the proposed mitigation and 
monitoring measures) and the 
anticipated take of marine mammals, 
NMFS preliminarily finds that small 
numbers of marine mammals would be 
taken relative to the population size of 
the affected species or stocks. 
Unmitigable Adverse Impact Analysis

find that the specified activity would

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60681 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices not have an ‘‘unmitigable adverse 
impact’’ on the subsistence uses of the 
affected marine mammal species or 
stocks by Alaskan Natives. NMFS has 
defined ‘‘unmitigable adverse impact’’ 
in 50 CFR 216.103 as an impact 
resulting from the specified activity: (1) 
that is likely to reduce the availability 
of the species to a level insufficient for 
a harvest to meet subsistence needs by: 
(i) causing the marine mammals to 
abandon or avoid hunting areas; (ii) 
directly displacing subsistence users; or 
(iii) placing physical barriers between 
the marine mammals and the 
subsistence hunters; and (2) that cannot 
be sufficiently mitigated by other 
measures to increase the availability of 
marine mammals to allow subsistence 
needs to be met. 
Hunting and fishing for the purpose of 
subsistence has been a critical 
component of the history and culture of 
Alaska, including the Aleutian Islands. 
The Unangan have displayed highly 
skilled techniques for fishing, hunting 
of marine mammals, and gathering and 
usage of shellfish and plants for 
thousands of years (Keating et al., 2022). 
Historically, the Unangan relied on 
harbor seals, Steller sea lions, and sea 
otters for subsistence. Not only did they 
provide a source of food, which was 
shared between households, but also a 
source for oil, decoration, and clothing 
(Haynes and Mishler, 1991). However, 
very little information is available 
regarding subsistence hunting of marine 
mammals in Cold Bay, with most 
information coming from nearby 
communities (False Pass, King Cove, 
and Unalaska). Based on subsistence 
records from 2016, tracked by the 
Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s 
(ADF&G) Division of Subsistence, Cold 
Bay has shown a higher preference for 
fishing than subsistence hunting of 
marine mammals, catching 9,253 
pounds (lbs; 4,197.1 kilograms (kg)) of 
salmon compared to only 54 lbs (24.5 
kg) of marine mammals. Since 2016, no 
data are available on the number Steller 
sea lions or harbor seals harvested in 
Cold Bay. Even when looking at the 
nearby communities, Steller sea lions 
were harvested at low levels (one at 
False Pass in 1985 (40 mi (64.4 km) from 
Cold Bay), none at False Pass in 2007, 
1.3 at King Cove (20 mi (32.2 km) from 
Cold Bay) in 2007, and none in 2020 at 
Unalaska (170 mi (273.6 km) from Cold 
Bay). Comparatively, harbor seals made 
up a significant amount of the harvest 
at Unalaska in 2020 (74 percent) at 35 
harbor seals. At closer locations, 
between False Pass and King Cove, 
respectively, the annual harvest was 
made up of one and five harbor seals, 
demonstrating a low harvest rate. 
Between 2014 and 2024, a total of 25 sea 
otters were reported as harvested from 
Cold Bay (U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, 2025b). The annual harvest 
ranged from zero to nine sea otters in 
Cold Bay (at an average of 2.5 sea otters 
per year). 
Therefore, NMFS preliminarily 
determines that the proposed project is 
not likely to adversely affect the 
availability of any marine mammal 
species/stock that would traditionally 
be used for subsistence purposes, and 
would only minimally affect any 
subsistence harvest in the region 
because of the following reasons: 
€There are minimal recorded subsistence harvests of marine 
mammals in the area; 
€The construction activities would be localized and temporary in nature in 
a sheltered Bay; 
€Harbor seals and Steller sea lions do not have dedicated haul outs in Cold 
Bay, meaning their numbers are not 
occurring regularly enough to be a 
dependable resource, unlike the 
abundant rivers and streams, which 
provide ample fishing opportunities and 
is a more popular source of subsistence 
for local residents; 
€The proposed mitigation measures would minimize any disturbances of 
marine mammals in the area; 
€NMFS expects that the majority of effects on marine mammals would not 
rise above behavioral impacts and 
would be temporary in nature; and 
€No serious injury or mortality is expected to result from the project 
activities; therefore, the project would 
not result in a significant change to the 
availability of subsistence resources. 
Based on the description of the 
specified activity, the measures 
described to minimize adverse effects 
on the availability of marine mammals 
for subsistence purposes, and the 
proposed mitigation and monitoring 
measures, NMFS has preliminarily 
determined that there would not be an 
unmitigable adverse impact on 
subsistence uses from ADOT&PF’s 
proposed activities. 
Endangered Species Act 
Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA of 1973 (16 
U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) requires that each 
Federal agency ensures that any action 
it authorizes, funds, or carries out is not 
likely to jeopardize the continued 
existence of any endangered or 
threatened species or result in the 
destruction or adverse modification of 
designated critical habitat. To ensure 
ESA compliance for the issuance of 
incidental take authorizations, NMFS 
consults internally whenever we 
propose to authorize take for ESA-listed 
species, in this case with NMFS’ Alaska 
Regional Office. 
NMFS is proposing to authorize take 
of humpback whales (Mexico-North 
Pacific stock), humpback whales 
(Western North Pacific stock), and 
Steller sea lions (Western stock), which 
are all listed under the ESA. The 
Permits and Conservation Division has 
requested initiation of section 7 
consultation with NMFS’ Alaska 
Regional Office for the issuance of this 
IHA. NMFS would conclude the ESA 
consultation prior to reaching a 
determination regarding the proposed 
issuance of the authorization. 
Proposed Authorization 
As a result of these preliminary 
determinations, NMFS proposes to issue 
an IHA to ADOT&PF for conducting 
construction work for the Cold Bay 
Ferry Terminal Reconstruction Project 
in Cold Bay, Alaska, provided the 
previously mentioned mitigation, 
monitoring, and reporting requirements 
are incorporated. A draft of the 
proposed IHA can be found at: https://

ACTION: Notice, 2026 cost recovery fee percentages and average mothership 
cooperative program pricing. 
SUMMARY: This action provides participants in the Pacific Coast 
Groundfish Trawl Rationalization 
Program with the 2026 cost recovery fee 
percentages and the average mothership 
(MS) price per pound to be used in the 
catcher/processor (C/P) Co-op program 
to calculate the fee amount for the 
upcoming calendar year. For the 2026 
calendar year, NMFS announces the 
following fee percentages by sector 
specific program: 3.0 percent for the 
Shorebased Individual Fishing Quota 
(IFQ) Program; 0.3 percent for the C/P 
Co-op Program; and 3.0 percent for the 
MS Co-op Program. For 2026, the MS 
pricing to be used as a proxy by the 
C/P Co-op Program is $0.10/pound (lb) 
for Pacific whiting.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 304(d)(2)(A) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act (MSA) authorizes and requires 
NMFS to collect fees to recover the costs 
directly related to the management, data 
collection and analysis, and 
enforcement connected to and in 
support of a limited access privilege 
program (LAPP) (16 U.S.C. 1854(d)(2)), 
also called ‘‘cost recovery.’’ Cost 
recovery fees recover the actual costs 
directly related to the management, data 
collection and analysis, and 
enforcement of the programs (MSA 
Section 303A(e), 16 U.S.C. 1853a(e)). 
Section 304(d)(2)(B) of the MSA 
mandates that cost recovery fees not 
exceed 3 percent of the annual ex-vessel 
value of fish harvested by a program 
subject to a cost recovery fee, and that 
the fee be collected either at the time of 
landing, filing of a landing report, or 
sale of such fish during a fishing season 
or in the last quarter of the calendar year 
in which the fish is harvested. 
The Pacific Coast Groundfish Trawl 
Rationalization Program is a LAPP, 
implemented in 2011, and consists of 
three sector-specific programs: the 
Shorebased IFQ Program, the MS Co-op 
Program, and the C/P Co-op Program. In 
accordance with the MSA and based on 
a recommended structure and 
methodology developed in coordination 
with the Pacific Fishery Management 
Council (Council), NMFS began 
collecting mandatory fees of up to 3 
percent of the ex-vessel value of 
groundfish from each program 
(Shorebased IFQ Program, MS Co-op 
Program, and C/P Co-op Program) in 
2014. NMFS collects the fees to recover 
the incremental costs of management, 
data collection and analysis, and 
enforcement of the Groundfish Trawl 
Rationalization Program. Additional 
background can be found in the cost 
recovery proposed rule (78 FR 7371, 
February 1, 2013) and final rule (78 FR 
75268, December 11, 2013). The details 
of cost recovery for the Groundfish 
Trawl Rationalization Program are in 
regulation at 50 CFR 660.115 (Trawl 
fishery—cost recovery program), 
660.140 (Shorebased IFQ Program), 
660.150 (MS Co-op Program), and 
660.160 (C/P Co-op Program). 
By December 31 of each year, NMFS 
announces the next year’s fee 
percentages and the applicable MS 
pricing for the C/P Co-op Program. To 
calculate the fee percentages, NMFS 
used the formula specified in regulation 
at § 660.115(b)(1), where the fee 
percentage by sector equals the lower of 
3 percent or direct program costs (DPC) 
for that sector divided by total ex-vessel 
value (V) for that sector multiplied by 
100 (Fee percentage = the lower of 3 
percent or (DPC/V) × 100). ‘‘DPC’’ as defined in the regulations at 
§ 660.115(b)(1)(i), are the actual 
incremental costs for the previous fiscal 
year directly related to the management, 
data collection and analysis, and 
enforcement of each program 
(Shorebased IFQ Program, MS Co-op 
Program, and C/P Co-op Program). 
Actual incremental costs means those 
net costs that would not have been 
incurred but for the implementation of 
the Groundfish Trawl Rationalization 
Program, including both increased costs 
for new requirements of the program 
and reduced costs resulting from any 
program efficiencies or adjustments to 
costs from previous years. 
‘‘V’’, as specified at § 660.115(b)(1)(ii), 
is the total ex-vessel value, as defined at 
§ 660.111, for each sector from the 
previous calendar year. To determine 
the ex-vessel value for the Shorebased 
IFQ Program, NMFS used the ex-vessel 
value for calendar year 2024 as reported 
in the Pacific Fisheries Information 
Network (PacFIN) from Shorebased IFQ 
electronic fish tickets as this was the 
most recent complete set of data. To 
determine the ex-vessel value for the 
MS Co-op Program and the C/P Co-op 
Program, NMFS used the retained catch 
estimates (weight) for each sector as 
reported in the North Pacific Observer 
Program database multiplied by the 
average price of Pacific whiting as 
reported by participants in the MS Co- 
op program for 2024. 
The fee calculations for the 2026 fee 
percentages are described below. 
IFQ Program: 
€5.1 percent = ($2,110,933.27/ $41,126,145.00) × 100. C/P Co-op Program: 
€0.3 percent = ($50,758.19/ $15,663,157.09) × 100. MS Co-op Program: 
€4.2 percent = ($218,726.38/ $5,208,949.27) × 100. However, the calculated fee 
percentage cannot exceed the statutory 
limit of 3.0 percent. Both the IFQ 
Program (5.1 percent) and MS Co-op 
Program (4.2 percent) fee calculations 
exceed this limit, therefore, the 2026 fee

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60683 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices percentages for these Programs are 3.0 
percent. The final 2026 fee percentages 
are 3.0 percent for the IFQ Program, 0.3 
percent for the C/P Co-op Program, and 
3.0 percent for the MS Co-op Program. 
MS Average Pricing 
MS pricing is the average price per 
pound that the C/P Co-op Program will 
use to determine the fee amount due for 
that sector. The C/P sector value (V) is 
calculated by multiplying the retained 
catch estimates (weight) of Pacific 
whiting harvested by the vessel 
registered to a C/P-endorsed limited 
entry trawl permit by the MS pricing. 
NMFS has calculated the 2026 MS 
pricing to be used as a proxy by the CP 
Co-op Program as: $0.10/lb for Pacific 
whiting. 
Cost recovery fees are submitted to 
NMFS by fish buyers via Pay.gov 
(https://www.pay.gov/). Fees are only 
accepted at Pay.gov by credit/debit card or bank transfers. Cash or checks cannot 
be accepted. Fish buyers registered with 
Pay.gov can login in the upper right- hand corner of the screen. Fish buyers 
not registered with Pay.gov can go to the 
cost recovery forms directly from the 
website below. The links to the Pay.gov 
forms for each program (IFQ, MS, or C/

MS: https://www.pay.gov/public/form/ start/58378422; and C/P: https://www.pay.gov/public/form/ start/58102817. 
As stated in the preamble to the cost 
recovery proposed and final rules, in the 
spring of each year, NMFS will release 
an annual report documenting the 
details and data used for the fee 
percentage calculations. Annual reports

Additions 
On September 18, 2026 (90 FR 45023) 
and November 20, 2025 (90 FR 52358), 
the Committee for Purchase From 
People Who Are Blind or Severely 
Disabled (operating as the U.S. 
AbilityOne Commission) published an 
initial notice of proposed additions to 
the Procurement List. This final notice 
is published pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 
8503(a)(2) and 41 CFR 51–2.3. The 
Committee has determined that the 
product(s) and service(s) listed below 
are suitable for procurement by the 
Federal Government and has added 
these product(s) and service(s) to the 
Procurement List as a mandatory 
purchase for Federal entities. In 
accordance with 41 CFR 51–5.2, the 
Committee has authorized the qualified 
nonprofit agencies described with the 
product(s) and service(s) as the 
mandatory source(s) of supply.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60684 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices After consideration of the material 
presented to it concerning capability of 
qualified nonprofit agencies to provide 
the product(s) and impact of the 
additions on the current or most recent 
contractors, the Committee has 
determined that the product(s) listed 
below are suitable for procurement by 
the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 
8501–8506 and 41 CFR 51–2.4. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 
I certify that the following action will 
not have a significant impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
The major factors considered for this 
certification were: 
1. The action will not result in any 
additional reporting, recordkeeping or 
other compliance requirements for small 
entities other than the small 
organizations that will furnish the 
product(s) and service(s) to the 
Government. 
2. The action will result in 
authorizing small entities to furnish the 
product(s) and service(s) to the 
Government. 
3. There are no known regulatory 
alternatives which would accomplish 
the objectives of the Javits-Wagner- 
O’Day Act (41 U.S.C. 8501–8506) in 
connection with the product(s) and 
service(s) proposed for addition to the 
Procurement List. 
End of Certification 
Accordingly, the following product(s) 
are added to the Procurement List: 
Product(s)

CONTRACT OFC 7(00247) 
The Committee finds good cause to 
dispense with the 30-day delay in the 
effective date normally required by the 
Administrative Procedure Act. See 5 
U.S.C. 553(d). This addition to the 
Committee’s Procurement List is 
effectuated because of the expiration of 
the Department of Veteran Affairs, VISN 
7, Multiple Locations, GA, SC Laundry 
and Linen Service contract. The Federal 
customer contacted and has worked 
diligently with the AbilityOne Program 
to fulfill this service need under the 
AbilityOne Program. To avoid 
performance disruption, and the 
possibility that the Department of 
Veteran Affairs will refer its business 
elsewhere, this addition must be 
effective on January 12, 2026, ensuring 
timely execution for a January 12, 2026 
start date. The Committee published an 
initial notice of proposed Procurement 
List addition in the Federal Register on 
September 18, 2026 (90 FR 45023) but 
did not receive any comments. This 
addition will not create a public 
hardship and has limited effect on the 
public at large. Rather, this addition will 
create new jobs for other affected 
parties—people with significant 
disabilities in the AbilityOne program 
who otherwise face challenges locating 
employment. Moreover, this addition 
enables the Federal customer to 
continue operations without 
interruption. 
Deletions 
On November 20, 2026 (90 FR 52358), 
the Committee for Purchase From 
People Who Are Blind or Severely 
Disabled published notice of proposed 
deletions from the Procurement List. 
This notice is published pursuant to 41 
U.S.C. 8503 (a)(2) and 41 CFR 51–2.3. 
After consideration of the relevant 
matter presented, the Committee has 
determined that the product(s) and 
service(s) listed below are no longer 
suitable for procurement by the Federal 
Government under 41 U.S.C. 8501–8506 
and 41 CFR 51–2.4. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 
I certify that the following action will 
not have a significant impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
The major factors considered for this 
certification were: 
1. The action will not result in 
additional reporting, recordkeeping or 
other compliance requirements for small 
entities. 
2. The action may result in 
authorizing small entities to furnish the 
product(s) and service(s) to the 
Government. 
3. There are no known regulatory 
alternatives which would accomplish 
the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-

connection with the product(s) and

Record of Decision for Real Property 
Master Plan Implementation at Military 
Ocean Terminal Sunny Point, North 
Carolina (ID# EISX–007–21–001– 
1751989587) 
AGENCY: Department of the Army, DoD. ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: The Department of the Army (Army) announces the availability of a 
Record of Decision (ROD) regarding the 
proposed implementation of real 
property actions at Military Ocean 
Terminal Sunny Point (MOTSU), North 
Carolina. In accordance with the 
National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA), the ROD identifies the Army’s 
selected alternative, the basis for its 
selection, the environmentally preferred 
alternative, and the mitigation and 
protective measures the Army commits 
to implement with the selected 
alternative. The ROD is based on the 
results of the Army’s Final 
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), 
which analyzed the potential effects of 
the implementation of various projects 
needed for the safety and mission of the 
facility and provides an analysis of the 
effects of implementing real property 
maintenance, repair, upgrade, and 
development actions. The proposed 
action is needed to address 
improvements to real property related to 
explosive safety, waterfront 
maintenance, security, and linear 
infrastructure. The projects and 
programs address compliance with 
federal, state, DoD, and Army standards 
vital to safety, security, and other 
mission needs. The EIS includes a final 
Finding of No Practicable Alternative 
(FONPA) prepared because portions of 
the proposed action occur in floodplains 
or involve construction in wetlands, or 
both. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Frederick Rice, Director, Public and 
Congressional Affairs Office, Military 
Surface Deployment and Distribution 
Command; telephone: (618) 220–6284; 
email: frederick.l.rice.civ@army.mil. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: MOTSU is the Army Transportation Command’s 
East Coast strategic ammunition port 
and is among DoD’s seaports supporting 
global operations. The proposed action 
includes barricade safety, waterfront 
maintenance, Pleasure Island Explosive 
Safety Clear Zone security, linear 
infrastructure (e.g., roads, rail, utilities, firebreaks), stormwater mitigation, and 
cantonment area infill. The proposed 
action also includes modernizing 
operation areas and general repair and 
maintenance of infrastructure, to 
include facilities, wharves, roads, rail, 
utilities, and perimeter security. The 
proposed projects address critical 
mission requirements and are planned 
for fiscal years 2026 through 2031. 
The FEIS—published on July 9, 2025, 
and prepared in parallel with federal 
consultation processes (e.g., section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act 
and section 7 of the Endangered Species 
Act)—evaluated the potential effects 
associated with implementing the 
proposed activities. The Army evaluated 
two alternatives that would meet the 
Proposed Action’s purpose and need: 
1. Full Implementation Alternative (Preferred Alternative): This alternative 
would implement the complete suite of 
14 projects that are required 
improvements to real property related to 
explosive safety, waterfront 
maintenance, security, and linear 
infrastructure. 
2. Partial Implementation Alternative: This alternative would implement a 
reduced set of 12 projects. Although the 
Partial Implementation Alternative 
would not address all requirements as 
comprehensively as the Full 
Implementation Alternative, it would 
substantially improve conditions and 
adequately address immediate 
installation needs. 
Under the No-Action Alternative, the 
projects would not be implemented. 
While the No-Action Alternative would 
not satisfy the Proposed Action’s 
purpose and need, in accordance with 
NEPA regulations, the No-Action 
Alternative provides a comparative 
baseline for gauging the Action 
Alternatives’ potential effects. 
The Final EIS determined the Full 
Implementation Alternative and Partial 
Implementation Alternatives would 
have potentially significant adverse 
effects on wetlands. The Army prepared 
a Finding of No Practicable Alternative 
(FONPA) addressing potential effects on 
wetlands and floodplains. The FONPA 
is included as an appendix to the Final 
EIS. The Final EIS concluded the 
adverse effects on all analyzed resources 
other than wetlands would be less than 
significant under either action 
alternative. 
Based on the analysis presented in the 
Final EIS, the Full Implementation 
Alternative is the Army’s selected

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60690 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices alternative because it provides the 
improvements necessary to support 
MOTSU’s mission and ensure safety. 
The ROD adopts multiple mitigation 
and protective measures to prevent or 
minimize the potential adverse 
environmental effects of the Full 
Implementation Alternative. The Army 
is using all practicable means to avoid 
or minimize environmental harm 
caused by the selected alternative. 
MOTSU Department of Public Works 
Environmental personnel will review 
the planning documents for each of the 
proposed projects prior to initiation to 
ensure compatibility with applicable 
regulatory requirements, best 
management practices, and 
minimization measures. Additional 
surveys, sampling, or testing may be 
required. 
The ROD is available on the project 
website at: https://www.army.mil/ 
artrans#org-about. Publication of the ROD formally concludes the NEPA 
process for this Proposed Action. The 
Army will proceed with the Full 
Implementation Alternative described 
in the Final EIS and will execute the 
mitigation and protective measures 
identified in the ROD.

age debt according to DCIA; 
report the eligibility of DCIA-aged 
debt for referral to the Treasury Offset 
Program (TOP); and 
report compliance with Form 1099–C 
reporting.

Title of Collection: Third Party

Respondents/Affected Public: Private 
Sector; Individuals and Households; 
State, Local, and Tribal Governments. 
Total Estimated Number of Annual 
Responses: 75. Total Estimated Number of Annual 
Burden Hours: 48. 
Abstract: The Department of Education (the Department) is seeking a 
revision of the OMB approval of the 
Third Party Servicer Data Form. This 
form collects information from third 
party servicers. The HEA allows 
institutions of higher education to 
outsource aspects of their participation 
in Title IV programs. Any individual or 
entity that contracts with or performs 
work on behalf of an institution to 
administer any aspect of that 
institution’s responsibilities required 
under the Title IV programs is defined 
as a third-party servicer. The Title IV 
regulations authorize the Department to 
provide oversight of third-party 
servicers, which are subject to the 
highest standard of care and diligence in 
their administration of Title IV 
programs. (34 CFR 668.2) The 
information collected through the 
Third-Party Servicer Data Inquiry form 
allows the Department to identify 
institutions of higher education that are 
failing to report or incorrectly reporting 
third-party servicer information; to 
monitor and enforce third-party servicer 
compliance with annual audit 
requirements; to identify other persons 
or organizations that contract with a 
third-party servicer to assist with any 
aspect of the administration of a Title IV 
program on behalf of the third-party 
servicer or its clients; and to effectively 
coordinate third-party servicer program 
review assessments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background: The Advisory Board was established under the Energy Employees 
Occupational Illness Compensation 
Program Act of 2000 to advise the 
President on a variety of policy and 
technical functions required to 
implement and effectively manage the 
compensation program. Key functions of 
the Advisory Board include providing 
advice on the development of 
probability of causation guidelines, 
which have been promulgated by the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS) as a final rule; advice on 
methods of dose reconstruction, which 
have also been promulgated by HHS as 
a final rule; advice on the scientific 
validity and quality of dose estimation 
and reconstruction efforts being 
performed for purposes of the 
compensation program; and advice on 
petitions to add classes of workers to the 
Special Exposure Cohort (SEC). In 
December 2000, the President delegated 
responsibility for funding, staffing, and 
operating the Advisory Board to HHS, 
which subsequently delegated this 
authority to the CDC. NIOSH 
implements this responsibility for CDC. 
The charter was issued on August 3, 
2001, renewed at appropriate intervals, 
and rechartered under Executive Order 
14109 (September 29, 2023) on March 
22, 2024. Unless continued by the 
President, the Advisory Board will 
terminate on September 30, 2027, 
consistent with Executive Order 14354 
of September 29, 2025. 
Purpose: The Advisory Board is charged with (a) providing advice to the 
Secretary, HHS, on the development of 
guidelines under Executive Order 
13179; (b) providing advice to the 
Secretary, HHS, on the scientific 
validity and quality of dose 
reconstruction efforts performed for this 
program; and (c) upon request by the 
Secretary, HHS, advising the Secretary 
on whether there is a class of employees 
at any Department of Energy facility 
who were exposed to radiation but for 
whom it is not feasible to estimate their 
radiation dose, and on whether there is 
reasonable likelihood that such 
radiation doses may have endangered 
the health of members of this class. The 
ABRWH Subcommittee on Procedure 
Reviews (SPR) is responsible for 
overseeing, tracking, and participating 
in the reviews of all procedures used in 
the dose reconstruction process by the 
NIOSH Division of Compensation 
Analysis and Support (DCAS) and its 
dose reconstruction contractor (Oak 
Ridge Associated Universities—ORAU). 
Matters to be Considered: The agenda 
will include discussions on the 
following: 
1. Administrative items, including: a. 
SPR-approved documents for next Full 
Board meeting, b. discussion of 
professional judgement assessment of 
six PER–017 case reviews. c. list of

ACTION: Request for public comments. SUMMARY: The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is 
requesting a 3-year extension of the 
Children’s Justice Act (CJA) Program 
Instruction (Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) #: 0970–0425, expiration 
March 31, 2026). There are no changes 
requested to the instructions. 
DATES: Comments due February 27, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: In compliance with the requirements of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995, ACF is soliciting 
public comment on the specific aspects 
of the information collection described 
above. You can obtain copies of the 
proposed collection of information and 
submit comments by emailing 
infocollection@acf.hhs.gov. Identify all requests by the title of the information 
collection. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Description: The CJA Program Instruction, prepared in response to the 
enactment of the CJA Title I of Public 
Law 111–320, Child Abuse Prevention 
and Treatment Act Reauthorization of 
2010, provides direction to the states 
and territories to accomplish the 
purposes of assisting states in 
developing, establishing, and operating 
programs designed to improve (1) the 
assessment and investigation of 
suspected child abuse and neglect cases, 
including cases of suspected child 
sexual abuse and exploitation, in a 
manner that limits additional trauma to 
the child and the child’s family; (2) the 
assessment and investigation of cases of 
suspected child abuse-related fatalities 
and suspected child neglect-related 
fatalities; (3) the investigation and 
prosecution of cases of child abuse and 
neglect, including child sexual abuse 
and exploitation; and (4) the assessment 
and investigation of cases involving 
children with disabilities or serious 
health-related problems who are 
suspected victims of child abuse or 
neglect. This Program Instruction 
contains information collection 
requirements that are found in Public 
Law 111–320 at sections 107(b) and 
107(d), and pursuant to receiving a grant 
award. The information being collected 
is required by statute to be submitted 
pursuant to receiving a grant award. The 
information submitted will be used by 
the agency to ensure compliance with 
the statute; to monitor, evaluate, and 
measure grantee achievements in 
addressing the investigation and 
prosecution of child abuse and neglect; 
and to report to Congress. 
Respondents: State governments. Annual Burden Estimates 
The length of the CJA Program 
Instruction has been reduced by 18 
percent from 17 pages to 14 pages. Edits 
have been made to remove requests for 
information not required by statute, 
reduce duplicative information, and 
simplify language. As a result of the 
reduction in the length of time needed 
to both read and respond to the Program 
Instruction, the estimated response 
burden has been lowered by 17 percent 
from 60 hours to 50 hours per response.

information collection (UPD; Office of

This includes transitioning to use one 
simplified version of the UPD with edits 
to the language for clarification and 
plain language purposes. Two versions 
of the instructions remain in the 
proposed simplified version to 
accommodate two development 
methods. ACF is in the process of 
identifying more significant revisions to 
the UPD, which will be submitted 
through a future information collection 
request to OMB. 
DATES: Comments due February 27, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: In compliance with the requirements of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995, ACF is soliciting 
public comment on the specific aspects 
of the information collection described 
above. You can obtain copies of the 
proposed collection of information and 
submit comments by emailing 
infocollection@acf.hhs.gov. Identify all requests by the title of the information 
collection. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Description: The UPD provides a uniform format for applicants to submit 
project information in response to ACF 
discretionary Notice of Funding 
Opportunities (NOFO). The UPD 
requires applicants to describe how 
program objectives will be achieved and 
provide a rationale for the project’s 
budgeted costs. All ACF discretionary 
award programs are required to use the 
UPD. 
Since 2023, there have been two 
versions of the UPD: the traditional 
version and the simplified version 
(SimplerNOFOs). SimplerNOFOs were 
implemented as a pilot, as approved by 
OMB. SimplerNOFOs streamline the 
process for applicants and has been well 
received by programs and applicants. 
ACF has expanded use of the simplified 
version as a result. At this time, ACF is 
proposing to transition completely to 
the SimplerNOFO UPD, but will retain 
two sets of instructions for now due to 
the way NOFOs are currently 
developed. The distinction is made in 
the instructions with the labels 
‘‘SimplerNOFO’’ v. ‘‘Traditional 
NOFO’’. 
ACF uses the information provided by 
applicants, along with other OMB- 
approved information collections 
(Standard Forms), to evaluate and rank 
applications. Use of the UPD protects 
the integrity of the ACF award selection 
process. 
This current request would extend 
OMB approval for an additional year, 
with the following changes: 
—Minor revisions for clarification and 
plain language purposes 
—Updated burden estimates to only 
include the SimplerNOFOs UPD. 
A larger revision effort is in process 
and will be submitted to OMB in the 
future. This future revision request will 
include two additional opportunities for 
public comment. 
Respondents: Applicants responding to ACF Discretionary NOFOs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Description: The LIHEAP Quarterly Report assists the Office of Community 
Services in receiving data and 
information about LIHEAP during the 
federal fiscal year (FFY). This almost 
real time data ensures ACF can continue 
to: 
1. Track key information, such as the 
number of households served, in ‘‘real 
time’’ versus in the new fiscal year. 
2. Effectively address challenges in a 
timely manner, including supporting 
emerging training and technical 
assistance needs, addressing challenges 
with obligating funds, and addressing 
outreach and intake issues, such as 
reaching newly eligible households. 
3. Ensure accountability and 
transparency by using the information

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60698 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices to regularly update public dashboards 
and keep key decision makers informed 
of grantee progress. All grant recipients, 
including states, tribes, and territories, 
will submit brief quarterly reports with 
critical information on the status of 
LIHEAP. The Quarterly Report forms 
will include questions on: 
€Total households assisted, €Performance management including the number of occurrences in which 
LIHEAP funding prevented the loss of or 
restored home energy services, and 
€The estimated percentage of LIHEAP funds that have been obligated 
by funding component. 
Grant recipients will also have an 
opportunity to highlight additional 
training/technical assistance needs/ 
suggestions, which the Office of 
Community Services uses to inform 
support such as training and resources. 
ACF also proposes several small 
changes to the LIHEAP Quarterly Report 
beginning with the Quarter 4 report due 
October 31, 2025 and beyond. Those 
changes only affect Section III of the 
Quarter 3 (due July 31, 2026 and 
beyond) and Quarter 4 reports (due 
October 31, 2025 and beyond). The 
changes to Section III involve inclusion 
of the primary data elements from the 
separate LIHEAP Carryover and 
Reallotment Report (OMB #: 0970– 
0106), which ACF wishes to discontinue 
use of in favor of only obtaining such 
data through the LIHEAP Quarterly 
Report. Section III would more clearly 
distinguish ‘‘carryover’’ fund estimated 
(Quarter 3) and final amounts (Quarter 
4) from ‘‘reallotment’’ fund estimated 
and final amounts. The Quarter 3 and 4 
Section III also includes a ‘‘remarks’’ 
field for grant recipients to complete 
only if they are indicating a request to 
carryover funds to obligate in the next 
FFY. The federal LIHEAP statute 
requires all grant recipients requesting 
carryover to explain why they wish to 
carryover and how they intend to use 
such carryover funds in the next year 
(42 U.S.C. 8626(b)(2)(A)). 
Respondents: States and tribes. Annual Burden Estimates 
The estimated time per response for 
this report was increased from 12 to 16 
hours to account for the proposed 
changes. These changes are expected to 
reduce effort overall, however, by 
eliminating the Carryover and 
Reallotment Report, as discussed above.

Proposed Information Collection 
Activity; Generic Program-Specific

AGENCY: Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services. 
ACTION: Request for public comments. SUMMARY: This notice describes the proposal to extend data collection under 
the Administration for Children and 
Families (ACF) Generic Program- 
Specific Performance Progress Report 
(PPR) (0970–0490). This overarching 
generic currently allows ACF program 
offices to collect performance and 
progress data from recipients and sub- 
recipients who receive funding from 
ACF under a grant or cooperative 
agreement. This generic mechanism 
provides the opportunity for ACF 
program offices to tailor requests for 
performance and progress data to 
specific funding recipients. There are no 
proposed changes to the overarching 
generic. 
DATES: Comments due February 27, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: In compliance with the requirements of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995, ACF is soliciting 
public comment on the specific aspects 
of the information collection described 
above. You can obtain copies of the 
proposed collection of information and 
submit comments by emailing 
infocollection@acf.hhs.gov. Identify all requests by the title of the information 
collection. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Description: ACF is primarily a grant- making agency that promotes the 
economic and social well-being of 
families, children, individuals and 
communities with partnerships, 
funding, guidance, training and 
technical assistance. Prior to the use of 
this umbrella generic for program- 
specific PPRs, all ACF discretionary 
grant and cooperative agreement awards 
used the standard ACF PPR (#0970– 
0406) for post award reporting. The 
standard ACF PPR form requires 
grantees to only respond to a common 
set of broad questions, which could 
result in receipt of only qualitative or 
incomplete information for some 
programs. This one-size-fits-all 
approach did not adequately collect the 
specific data needed for particular grant 
programs or allow program offices to 
assess continuous quality improvement. 
Different grant programs vary in 
purpose, target population, and 
activities. Therefore, a need for program 
offices to customize performance 
measurements was identified and the 
generic program-specific PPR was 
developed.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60699 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices ACF program offices have benefited 
from the ability to create and use a 
program-specific PPR that is more 
effective and includes specific data 
elements that reflects a specific 
program’s indicators, demographics, 
priorities and objectives. 
A generic program-specific PPR that 
can be tailored for program-specific 
needs allows program offices to collect 
useful data in a uniform and systematic 
manner. The reporting format allows 
program offices to gather uniform 
program performance data from each 
grantee, allowing aggregation at the 
program level to calculate outputs and 
outcomes, providing a snapshot and 
allowing for longitudinal analysis. 
Data from a tailored program-specific 
PPR that demonstrates a program’s 
successes and challenges have been 
useful for accountability purposes, such 
as required reports to Congress. 
Moreover, it has been useful for program 
management and oversight, such as 
identifying grantees’ technical 
assistance needs and ensuring 
compliance with federal and 
programmatic regulations and policies. 
To review currently approved PPRs 
under this generic, see: https://
www.reginfo.gov/public/do/ 
PRAICList?ref_nbr=202507-0970-011. Respondents: ACF funding recipients. Annual Burden Estimates 
The following burden estimates 
include burden associated with 
currently approved individual requests 
that ACF expects will be extended 
through this extension request and an 
estimate of burden for potential new 
requests under this generic. Burden 
associated with currently approved 
individual requests has been updated to 
reflect current estimates for number of 
respondents, time per response, and 
reporting cadence. Note that new 
requests may be submitted during this 
comment period, which would be 
included with the extension request in 
2026.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60701 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices extended for a period of up to 5 years 
so long as the patented item (human 
drug or biological product, animal drug 
product, medical device, food additive, 
or color additive) was subject to 
regulatory review by FDA before the 
item was marketed. Under these acts, a 
product’s regulatory review period 
forms the basis for determining the 
amount of extension an applicant may 
receive. 
A regulatory review period consists of 
two periods of time: a testing phase and 
an approval phase. For human drug 
products, the testing phase begins when 
the exemption to permit the clinical 
investigations of the drug becomes 
effective and runs until the approval 
phase begins. The approval phase starts 
with the initial submission of an 
application to market the human drug 
product and continues until FDA grants 
permission to market the drug product. 
Although only a portion of a 
regulatory review period may count 
toward the actual amount of extension 
that the Director of USPTO may award 
(for example, half the testing phase must 
be subtracted as well as any time that 
may have occurred before the patent 
was issued), FDA’s determination of the 
length of a regulatory review period for 
a human drug product will include all 
of the testing phase and approval phase 
as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B). 
FDA has approved for marketing the 
human drug product, ZELSUVMI 
(berdazimer sodium), indicated for the 
topical treatment of molluscum 
contagiosum (MC) in adults and 
pediatric patients 1 year of age and 
older. Subsequent to this approval, the 
USPTO received a patent term 
restoration application for ZELSUVMI 
(U.S. Patent No. 9,855,211) from LNHC, 
Inc. and the USPTO requested FDA’s 
assistance in determining the patent’s 
eligibility for patent term restoration. In 
a letter dated June 27, 2025, FDA 
advised the USPTO that this human 
drug product had undergone a 
regulatory review period and that the 
approval of ZELSUVMI represented the 
first permitted commercial marketing or 
use of the product. Thereafter, the 
USPTO requested that FDA determine 
the product’s regulatory review period. 
II. Determination of Regulatory Review 
Period 
FDA has determined that the 
applicable regulatory review period for 
ZELSUVMI is 4,144 days. Of this time, 
3,778 days occurred during the testing 
phase of the regulatory review period, 
while 366 days occurred during the 
approval phase. These periods of time 
were derived from the following dates: 
1. The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 
355(i)) became effective: September 2, 
2012. FDA has verified the applicant’s 
claim that the date the investigational 
new drug application became effective 
was on September 2, 2012. 
2. The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the 
human drug product under section 505 
of the FD&C Act: January 5, 2023. FDA 
has verified the applicant’s claim that 
the new drug application (NDA) for 
ZELSUVMI (NDA 217424) was initially 
submitted on January 5, 2023. 
3. The date the application was approved: January 5, 2024. FDA has verified the applicant’s claim that NDA 
217424 was approved on January 5, 
2024. 
This determination of the regulatory 
review period establishes the maximum 
potential length of a patent extension. 
However, the USPTO applies several 
statutory limitations in its calculations 
of the actual period for patent extension. 
In its application(s) for patent extension, 
this applicant seeks 1,280 days of patent 
term extension. 
III. Petitions 
Anyone with knowledge that any of 
the dates as published are incorrect may 
submit either electronic or written 
comments and, under 21 CFR 60.24, ask 
for a redetermination (see 
DATES). 
Furthermore, as specified in § 60.30 (21 
CFR 60.30), any interested person may 
petition FDA for a determination 
regarding whether the applicant for 
extension acted with due diligence 
during the regulatory review period. To 
meet its burden, the petition must 
comply with all the requirements of 
§ 60.30, including but not limited to: 
must be timely (see 
DATES), must 
be filed in accordance with § 10.20, 
must contain sufficient facts to merit an 
FDA investigation, and must certify that 
a true and complete copy of the petition 
has been served upon the patent 
applicant. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th

Authorization of Emergency Use for 
Two Animal Drugs for the Treatment of 
New World Screwworm; Availability 
AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. 
ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) is 
announcing the issuance of two 
Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) 
(Authorization) under the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) for 
new animal drug products. FDA has 
issued one EUA for a new animal drug 
product as requested by Elanco US Inc. 
for the treatment of infestations caused 
by New World screwworm (Cochliomyia 
hominivorax) (NWS) larvae (myiasis) in 
dogs and puppies and one EUA for a 
new animal drug product as requested 
by Elanco US Inc. for the treatment of 
infestations caused by NWS larvae 
(myiasis) in cats and kittens. The 
Authorizations contain, among other 
things, conditions on the emergency use 
of the authorized products. The 
Authorizations follow the August 18, 
2025, determination by the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services (HHS) that 
there is a public health emergency, or a 
significant potential for a public health 
emergency, that affects or has a 
significant potential to affect national 
security or the health and security of 
U.S. citizens living abroad and that 
involves NWS. On the basis of such 
determination, the Secretary of HHS 
declared on August 18, 2025, that 
circumstances exist justifying the 
authorization of emergency use of 
animal drugs to treat or prevent NWS 
myiasis in animals. The Authorizations, 
which include an explanation of the 
reasons for issuance, are reprinted in 
this document. 
DATES: The Authorizations are effective on their dates of issuance: October 24, 
2025, and November 21, 2025, 
respectively. 
ADDRESSES: Submit written requests for single copies of the EUAs to the Policy 
and Regulations Staff, Center for

In the case of a determination by the Secretary 
of Defense, the Secretary of HHS shall determine, 
within 45 calendar days of such determination, 
whether to make a declaration under section 
564(b)(1) of the FD&C Act, and, if appropriate, shall 
promptly make such a declaration (see section 
564(b)(6) of the FD&C Act).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
Section 564 of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. 360bbb–3) allows FDA to 
strengthen public health protections 
against biological, chemical, nuclear, 
and radiological agents. Among other 
things, section 564 of the FD&C Act 
allows FDA to authorize the use of an 
unapproved medical product or an 
unapproved use of an approved medical 
product in certain situations. With this 
EUA authority, FDA can help ensure 
that medical countermeasures may be 
used in emergencies to diagnose, treat, 
or prevent serious or life-threatening 
diseases or conditions caused by 
biological, chemical, nuclear, or 
radiological agents when there are no 
adequate, approved, and available 
alternatives (among other criteria). 
II. Criteria for EUA Authorization 
Section 564(b)(1) of the FD&C Act 
provides that, before an EUA may be 
issued, the Secretary of HHS must 
declare that circumstances exist 
justifying the authorization based on 
one of the following grounds: (A) a 
determination by the Secretary of 
Homeland Security that there is a 
domestic emergency, or a significant 
potential for a domestic emergency, 
involving a heightened risk of attack 
with a biological, chemical, radiological, 
or nuclear agent or agents; (B) a 
determination by the Secretary of 
Defense that there is a military 
emergency, or a significant potential for 
a military emergency, involving a 
heightened risk to U.S. military forces, 
including personnel operating under the 
authority of title 10 or title 50, U.S. 
Code, of attack with (i) a biological, 
chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent 
or agents (‘‘CBRN’’); or (ii) an agent or 
agents that may cause, or are otherwise 
associated with, an imminently life- 
threatening and specific risk to U.S. 
military forces;
1
(C) a determination by 
the Secretary of HHS that there is a 
public health emergency, or a 
significant potential for a public health 
emergency, that affects, or has a 
significant potential to affect, national 
security or the health and security of 
U.S. citizens living abroad, and that 
involves a CBRN agent or agents, or a 
disease or condition that may be 
attributable to such agent or agents; or 
(D) the identification of a material threat 
by the Secretary of Homeland Security 
pursuant to section 319F–2 of the Public 
Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 
247d–6b) sufficient to affect national 
security or the health and security of 
U.S. citizens living abroad. 
Once the Secretary of HHS has 
declared that circumstances exist 
justifying an authorization under 
section 564 of the FD&C Act, FDA may 
authorize the emergency use of a drug, 
device, or biological product if the 
Agency concludes that the statutory 
criteria are satisfied. Under section 
564(h)(1) of the FD&C Act, FDA is 
required to publish in the Federal 
Register a notice of each authorization, and each termination or revocation of an 
authorization, and an explanation of the 
reasons for the action. Under section 
564(h)(1) of the FD&C Act, revisions to 
an authorization shall be made available 
on FDA’s website. Section 564 of the 
FD&C Act permits FDA to authorize the 
introduction into interstate commerce of 
a drug, device, or biological product 
intended for use in an actual or 
potential emergency when the Secretary 
of HHS has declared that circumstances 
exist justifying the authorization of 
emergency use. Products appropriate for 
emergency use may include products 
and uses that are not approved, cleared, 
or licensed under sections 505, 510(k), 
512, or 515 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 
355, 360(k), 360b, and 360e) or section 
351 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262), or 
conditionally approved under section 
571 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360ccc). 
Under section 564(c) of the FD&C Act, 
FDA may issue an EUA only if, after 
consultation with the HHS Assistant 
Secretary for Preparedness and 
Response, the Director of the National 
Institutes of Health, and the Director of 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (to the extent feasible and 
appropriate given the applicable 
circumstances), FDA
2
concludes: (1) 
that an agent referred to in a declaration 
of emergency or threat can cause a 
serious or life-threatening disease or 
condition; (2) that, based on the totality 
of scientific evidence available to FDA, 
including data from adequate and well- 
controlled clinical trials, if available, it 
is reasonable to believe that: (A) the 
product may be effective in diagnosing, 
treating, or preventing (i) such disease 
or condition; or (ii) a serious or life- 
threatening disease or condition caused 
by a product authorized under section 
564, approved or cleared under the 
FD&C Act, or licensed under section 351 
of the PHS Act, for diagnosing, treating, 
or preventing such a disease or 
condition caused by such an agent; and 
(B) the known and potential benefits of 
the product, when used to diagnose, 
prevent, or treat such disease or 
condition, outweigh the known and 
potential risks of the product, taking 
into consideration the material threat 
posed by the agent or agents identified 
in a declaration under section 
564(b)(1)(D) of the FD&C Act, if 
applicable; (3) that there is no adequate, 
approved, and available alternative to 
the product for diagnosing, preventing, 
or treating such disease or condition; (4) 
in the case of a determination described 
in section 564(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the FD&C 
Act, that the request for emergency use 
is made by the Secretary of Defense; and 
(5) that such other criteria as may be 
prescribed by regulation are satisfied. 
No other criteria for issuance have been 
prescribed by regulation under section 
564(c)(4) of the FD&C Act. 
III. The Authorizations 
The Authorizations follow the August 
18, 2025, determination by the Secretary 
of HHS that there is a public health 
emergency, or a significant potential for 
a public health emergency, that affects, 
or has a significant potential to affect, 
national security or the health and 
security of U.S. citizens living abroad 
and that involves NWS. On the basis of 
such determination, the Secretary of 
HHS declared, on August 18, 2025, that 
circumstances exist justifying the 
authorization of emergency use of 
animal drugs to treat or prevent NWS 
myiasis in animals. Notice of the 
Secretary’s determination and 
declaration was provided in the Federal 
Register on August 20, 2025 (90 FR 40609). Having concluded that the 
criteria for the issuance of the 
Authorizations under section 564(c) of 
the FD&C Act are met, FDA has issued 
two authorizations for the emergency 
use of animal drug products. On 
October 24, 2025, FDA issued an EUA 
to Elanco US Inc. for the animal drug 
product Credelio (lotilaner), subject to 
the terms of its Authorization. On 
November 21, 2025, FDA issued an EUA 
to Elanco US Inc. for the animal drug 
product Credelio CAT (lotaliner), 
subject to the terms of its Authorization.

Re: Emergency Use Authorization 006662 
Dear Dr. MCKuSick: 
October 24, 2025 
This letter ls in response to the request by Elanco US Inc. (Elartco) that the Ft>od and Drug 
Administration (FDA or Agency). issue an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the 
emergency use of CredeliO. (IOtilaner) forthetreatrnent of infestations caused by New World 
screwworm (Coch/iomyia hominivorax) larvae (myiasis) in dogs and puppies, pursuant to 
Section 564 of tile Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. §360bbb-3). 
On August 18, 2025, pursuant to Section 584(b)(1)(C) of the FO&C Act, the Secretary of the 
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) determined that there is significant potential 
for a public healtl1 ernergency that has a significant. potential to affect .national security or the 
health and security of United States Citizens living abroad and that involves New World 
screwworm (Cochliomyia hominovorax) (hereinafter"NWS"}. On the basis ofsuch 
determination, the Secretary of HHS on .August 18, 2025, declared that circumstances exist 
justifying the authorization of emergency use of animal drugs to treat or prevent NWS myiasis in 
animals, pursuant to section 564(b)(1) of the FD&C Act, subject to terms of any authorization 
issued under that section.
1 
Credelio is an antiparasitic that kills adult fleas and is indicated under NADA 141-494 for the 
treatment and prevention of flea infestations (ctenocephalides fe/is) and the treatment and control 
of tick infestations [Amb/yommaamertcanum (lone star tick), Dermacentorvariabilis(American dog 
tick), Txodes scapularis (black-legged tick), Rhipicephalus sanguineus. (brown dog tick), and 
Haemaphysalis /ongicomis (long homed tick)] for one month in dogs .and puppies 8 weeks Of: age 
and 
older, and weighing 4.4 pounds or greater. Credelio is indicated for the prevention of Borrelia 
burgdorferi infections as a direct result of killing lxodes scapularis vector ticks; however, Credelio is 
not approved for the treatment of NWS myiasis. 
Based on the scientiffc evidence available to the FbA, inciudihg data rrom published scientific 
literature, it is reasonable to believe that Credelio may be effective for the treatment of i11restations caused by NWS larvae (lllyiasis) in. dogs and puppies, as described in this 
authorization; and wtien used under the conditions described in this authorization; the known 
and potential benefits of Credelio outweigh the known and potential risks for dogs or au ages 
and weights because NWS is potentially fatal in dogs if left untreated, therefore justifying including dogs less than 8 weeks of age or less than 4.4 lbs in this authorization. 1

2. Based on the scientific evidence available to FDA, it is reasonable to believe that Credelio may be effective in treating NWS myiasis, and that, when used under the conditions described in this authorization, the known and potential benefits of Credelio when used to treat NWS outweigh the known and potential risks of such product; and 3. There is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the emergency use of Credelio for the treatment of infestations caused by NWS larvae (myiasis) in dogs and puppies.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
Tobacco products that meet the 
definition of a ‘‘new tobacco product,’’ 
and that an applicant intends to market 
in the United States, including ENDS, 
are subject to the requirements for a 
PMTA set forth in section 910(b) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(FD&C Act). When reviewing PMTAs, 
the Agency evaluates, among other 
things, a tobacco product’s components, 
ingredients, additives, constituents, 
design, harmful and potentially harmful 
constituents (HPHCs), and health risks, 
as well as how the product is 
manufactured, packaged, and labeled. 
After reviewing a company’s PMTA, 
FDA determines if the application 
includes or lacks sufficient evidence to 
demonstrate that permitting the 
marketing of the products would be 
appropriate for the protection of the 
public health (APPH), which is the 
applicable legal standard required by 
the FD&C Act (see section 910(c) of the 
FD&C Act). 
Through this notice, FDA announces 
a roundtable discussion to gather 
feedback from small tobacco product 
manufacturers (see 21 U.S.C. 387(16)) 
about their experience with, and other 
opinions about, the premarket 
application process. The topics to be 
discussed will include certain 
components of PMTAs such as product 
characterization, manufacturing 
controls, pharmacological profile (e.g., 
pharmacokinetic studies), studies of 
adult benefit (e.g., longitudinal cohort/ randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
studies), and toxicological profile (e.g., 
estimated lifetime cancer risk (ELCR)). 
FDA also is establishing a public docket 
to solicit comment on these topics. 
II. Topics for Discussion at the 
Roundtable and for the Request for 
Comments 
The purpose of the roundtable is to 
provide small ENDS manufacturers an 
opportunity to share their experience 
and other opinions about the premarket 
application process. Roundtable topics 
to be discussed include certain 
components of ENDS PMTAs, such as 
product characterization, manufacturing 
controls, pharmacological profile (e.g., 
pharmacokinetic studies), studies of 
adult benefit (e.g., longitudinal cohort/ RCT studies), and toxicological profile 
(e.g., ELCR). A. Product Characterization 
The foundational information 
necessary to evaluate the quality and 
consistency of a new tobacco product is 
based on an understanding of the 
product as delivered to the user. One of 
the critical pieces of information is a 
complete product listing and 
description, including details of the 
product design. Also included in ENDS 
product characterization is the 
measurement of constituents in the 
aerosol, including HPHCs, which 
provide details of a user’s exposure to 
nicotine and other potentially harmful 
ingredients. This roundtable will 
discuss the types of information needed 
to fully characterize a product in an 
application and can cover topics 
including product formulation, 
validation of analytical measurements, 
and the assessment of leachables and 
extractables, where appropriate. 
B. Manufacturing Controls 
In addition to product 
characterization, a complete 
understanding of a manufacturer’s 
internal controls and practices is 
important for FDA to ensure that 
products delivered to a user will be 
sufficiently similar to the products that 
were tested and that form the basis of 
our scientific assessment of nicotine and 
potential toxic constituent exposure 
from the new product. This information 
includes standard operating procedures 
(SOPs); work instructions; certificates of 
analysis; the linkage between label 
claim and actual measured nicotine 
delivery; and stability of new products 
during storage, transport, and shelf life, 
and these are all topics which may be 
covered and discussed in the 
roundtable. 
C. Pharmacological Profile (e.g., 
Pharmacokinetic Studies) 
One of the most important aspects of 
FDA’s evaluation of APPH for a new 
tobacco product focuses on the abuse 
liability of the new tobacco product 
including the delivery and uptake of 
nicotine by a user of the product. 
Nicotine exposure typically is evaluated 
through clinical studies that evaluate 
nicotine pharmacokinetics after use of 
the new tobacco product. Occasionally, 
it is possible to bridge the findings of 
one ENDS product to another, thus 
allowing a reduction in the number of 
studies needed to support a product. 
However, the proper designs of these 
clinical studies for ENDS products can 
be complex and need to be highly 
developed before work is initiated. This 
roundtable will address criteria that 
could improve the quality of the clinical 
studies for ENDS products submitted by 
applicants and provide participants an 
opportunity to ask questions about 
design basics to inform their 
applications. 
D. Studies of Adult Benefit (e.g., 
Longitudinal Cohort/RCT Studies) 
The understanding of the potential 
benefits that a new ENDS tobacco 
product may offer to users of combusted 
tobacco products by switching to the 
new ENDS tobacco product is critical to 
FDA’s APPH determination. Examples 
of population studies to assess 
switching include longitudinal cohort 
studies or randomized controlled trials 
of the new tobacco product with adult 
users. This roundtable will include a 
discussion of the critical considerations 
in the design and administration of 
these adult benefit studies. 
E. Toxicological Profile (e.g., ELCR) 
The toxicological assessment of a new 
tobacco product application for APPH 
includes a careful evaluation of critical 
elements of potential and actual risk 
posed by the use of the product. These 
critical elements typically include, 
among other topics, the hazard 
identification and associated risk 
assessment of HPHCs found in the 
aerosol of ENDS products and the risks 
associated with constituents in a new 
product. This roundtable will discuss 
approaches that an applicant could use 
to evaluate their products for potential 
risks from a genotoxicity approach 
(ELCR), inhalation toxicity, and HPHC 
exposure. 
III. Participating in the Roundtable and 
Selection of Participants 
Registration for the roundtable is open 
to small tobacco product manufacturers 
as defined in section 900(16) of the 
FD&C Act. The term ‘‘small tobacco 
product manufacturer’’ means a tobacco 
product manufacturer that employs 
fewer than 350 employees. For purposes 
of determining the number of employees 
of a manufacturer under the preceding 
sentence, the employees of a 
manufacturer are deemed to include the 
employees of each entity that controls, 
is controlled by, or is under common 
control with such manufacturer. For 
example, if a parent company owns two 
subsidiaries, the total number of 
employees would include the 
employees in the parent company plus 
the number of employees in the two 
subsidiaries. Additionally, registration 
for participation in the roundtable will 
be limited to 30 participants

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
The Drug Price Competition and 
Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 
(Pub. L. 98–417) and the Generic 
Animal Drug and Patent Term 
Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100–670) 
generally provide that a patent may be 
extended for a period of up to 5 years 
so long as the patented item (human 
drug or biologic product, animal drug 
product, medical device, food additive, 
or color additive) was subject to 
regulatory review by FDA before the 
item was marketed. Under these acts, a 
product’s regulatory review period 
forms the basis for determining the 
amount of extension an applicant may 
receive. 
A regulatory review period consists of 
two periods of time: a testing phase and 
an approval phase. For human 
biological products, the testing phase 
begins when the exemption to permit 
the clinical investigations of the 
biological product becomes effective 
and runs until the approval phase 
begins. The approval phase starts with 
the initial submission of an application 
to market the human biological product 
and continues until FDA grants 
permission to market the biological 
product. Although only a portion of a 
regulatory review period may count 
toward the actual amount of extension 
that the Director of USPTO may award 
(for example, half the testing phase must 
be subtracted as well as any time that 
may have occurred before the patent 
was issued), FDA’s determination of the 
length of a regulatory review period for 
a human biological product will include 
all of the testing phase and approval 
phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 
156(g)(1)(B). 
FDA has approved for marketing the 
human biologic product LEQEMBI 
(lecanemab- irmb). LEQEMBI is 
indicated for the treatment of 
Alzheimer’s disease. Subsequent to this 
approval, the USPTO received a patent 
term restoration application for 
LEQEMBI (U.S. Patent No. 8,025,878) 
from BioArctic AB, and the USPTO 
requested FDA’s assistance in 
determining this patent’s eligibility for 
patent term restoration. In a letter dated 
January 30, 2024, FDA advised the 
USPTO that this human biological 
product had undergone a regulatory 
review period and that the approval of 
LEQEMBI represented the first 
permitted commercial marketing or use 
of the product. Thereafter, the USPTO 
requested that FDA determine the 
product’s regulatory review period. 
II. Determination of Regulatory Review 
Period 
FDA has determined that the 
applicable regulatory review period for 
LEQEMBI is 4,546 days. Of this time, 
4,300 days occurred during the testing 
phase of the regulatory review period, 
while 246 days occurred during the 
approval phase. These periods of time 
were derived from the following dates: 
1. The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(i)) 
became effective: July 29, 2010. FDA has 
verified the applicant’s claim that the 
date the investigational new drug 
application became effective was on 
July 29, 2010. 
2. The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the 
human biological product under section 
351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 262): May 6, 2022. FDA has 
verified the applicant’s claim that the 
biologics license application (BLA) for 
LEQEMBI (BLA 761269) was initially 
submitted on May 6, 2022. 
3. The date the application was approved: January 6, 2023. FDA has verified the applicant’s claim that BLA 
761269 was approved on January 6, 
2023. 
This determination of the regulatory 
review period establishes the maximum 
potential length of a patent extension. 
However, the USPTO applies several 
statutory limitations in its calculations 
of the actual period for patent extension. 
In its application for patent extension, 
this applicant seeks 5 years of patent 
term extension. 
III. Petitions 
Anyone with knowledge that any of 
the dates as published are incorrect may 
submit either electronic or written 
comments and, under 21 CFR 60.24, ask 
for a redetermination (see 
DATES). 
Furthermore, as specified in § 60.30 (21 
CFR 60.30), any interested person may 
petition FDA for a determination 
regarding whether the applicant for 
extension acted with due diligence 
during the regulatory review period. To 
meet its burden, the petition must 
comply with all the requirements of 
§ 60.30, including but not limited to: 
must be timely (see 
DATES), must be 
filed in accordance with § 10.20, must 
contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA 
investigation, and must certify that a 
true and complete copy of the petition 
has been served upon the patent 
applicant. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th 
Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41–42, 1984.) 
Petitions should be in the format 
specified in 21 CFR 10.30.

Over-the-Counter Monograph Drug 
User Fee Amendments—OTC 
Monograph Order Request Fee Rates 
for Fiscal Year 2026 
AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. 
ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), as amended 
by the Over-the-Counter Monograph 
Drug User Fee Amendments (herein 
referred to as ‘‘OMUFA II’’), authorizes 
the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA, the Agency, or we) to assess and 
collect user fees from qualifying 
manufacturers of over-the-counter 
(OTC) monograph drugs and submitters 
of OTC monograph order requests 
(OMOR)s for fiscal years 2026 through 
2030. In this notice, FDA is announcing 
the OMOR fee rates for fiscal year (FY) 
2026. FDA plans to announce the FY 
2026 OMUFA facility fee rates, i.e., 
monograph drug facility (MDF) and 
contract manufacturing organization 
(CMO) facility fee rates, in a subsequent 
Federal Register notice (and anticipates 
its issuance will generally align with the 
timing of the OMUFA facility fee rate 
publication for prior FYs). 
DATES: These OMOR fees are effective on October 1, 2025, and will remain in 
effect through September 30, 2026. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Olufunmilayo Ariyo, Office of Financial 
Management, Food and Drug 
Administration, 10903 New Hampshire

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
Section 744M of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. 379j–72), as amended by OMUFA 
II,
1
authorizes FDA to assess and collect, 
for each of fiscal years 2026 through 
2030: (1) facility fees from qualifying 
owners of OTC MDFs and (2) fees from 
submitters of qualifying OTC OMORs. 
These fees are to support FDA’s OTC 
monograph drug activities, which are 
detailed in section 744L(6) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. 379j–71(6)) and include 
specified FDA activities associated with 
regulating OTC monograph drugs.
2
 
For OMUFA purposes, an OMOR is a 
request for an administrative order, with 
respect to an OTC monograph drug, 
which is submitted under section 
505G(b)(5) of the FD&C Act (see section 
744L(7) of the FD&C Act). 
Under section 744M(a)(2)(A) of the 
FD&C Act, the Agency is authorized to 
assess and collect fees from submitters 
of OMORs, except for OMORs that 
request certain safety-related changes 
(as discussed below). There are two 
levels of OMOR fees, based on whether 
the OMOR at issue is a Tier 1 or Tier 
2 OMOR.
2
 
For FY 2026, the OMUFA fee rates for 
OMORs are: Tier 1 OMOR fees 
($587,529) and Tier 2 OMOR fees 
($117,505). These fees are effective for 
the period from October 1, 2025, 
through September 30, 2026. This 
document is issued pursuant to section 
744M(a)(2) and (c)(5) of the FD&C Act 
and describes the calculations used to 
set the OMUFA OMOR fees for FY 2026 
in accordance with the directives in the 
statute. 
II. Determination of FY 2026 OMOR 
Fees 
For FY 2026, the Tier 1 OMOR fee is 
$587,529 and the Tier 2 OMOR fee is 
$117,505, including an adjustment for 
inflation (see sections 744M(a)(2)(A)(i) 
and (ii) of the FD&C Act, respectively). 
OMOR fees are not included in the 
OMUFA target revenue calculation, 
which is based on the facility fees (see 
section 744M(b) of the FD&C Act). 
An OMOR fee is generally assessed to 
each person who submits an OMOR (see 
section 744M(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act). 
OMOR fees are due on the date of the 
submission of the OMOR (see section 
744M(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act). The 
payor should submit the OMOR fee that 
applies to the type of OMOR they are 
submitting (i.e., Tier 1 or Tier 2). FDA will determine whether the appropriate 
OMOR fee has been submitted following 
receipt of the OMOR and the fee. 
An OMOR fee will not be assessed if 
the OMOR seeks to make certain safety 
changes with respect to an OTC 
monograph drug. Specifically, no fee 
will be assessed if FDA finds that the 
OMOR seeks to change the drug facts 
labeling of an OTC monograph drug in 
a way that would add to or strengthen: 
(1) a contraindication, warning, or 
precaution; (2) a statement about risk 
associated with misuse or abuse; or (3) 
an instruction about dosage and 
administration that is intended to 
increase the safe use of the OTC 
monograph drug (see section 
744M(a)(2)(C) of the FD&C Act). 
III. OMOR Fee Adjustment for Inflation 
The dollar amount of the inflation 
adjustment to the fee for OMORs for FY 
2026 is equal to the product of the 
applicable fee for FY 2025 and the 
inflation adjustment percentage.
3
For 
FY 2026, the inflation adjustment 
percentage is equal to the sum of: 
€The average annual percent change in the cost, per full-time equivalent 
(FTE) position at FDA, of all personnel 
compensation and benefits (PC&B) paid 
with respect to such positions for the 
first 3 years of the preceding 4 FYs, 
multiplied by the proportion of PC&B 
costs to total FDA costs of OTC 
monograph drug activities for the first 3 
years of the preceding 4 FYs (see section 
744M(c)(1)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act); and 
€The average annual percent change that occurred in the Consumer Price 
Index (CPI) for urban consumers 
(Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC- 
VA-MD-WV; Not Seasonally Adjusted; 
All items; Annual Index) for the first 3 
years of the preceding 4 years of 
available data multiplied by the 
proportion of all costs other than PC&B 
costs to total costs of OTC monograph 
drug activities for the first 3 years of the 
preceding 4 FYs (see section 
744M(c)(1)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act).

percent be multiplied by the proportion 
of all costs other than PC&B to total 
costs of OTC monograph drug activities 
(see section 744M(c)(1)(C)(ii) of the 
FD&C Act). Because 56.4429 percent 
was obligated for PC&B (as shown in 
table 2), 43.5571 percent is the portion 
of costs other than PC&B (100 
percent¥56.4429 percent = 43.5571 
percent). The non-payroll adjustment is 
4.3202 percent × 43.5571 percent, or 1.8818 percent. 
Next, we add the payroll adjustment 
(3.0758 percent) to the non-payroll 
adjustment (1.8818 percent), for a total 
inflation adjustment of 4.9576 percent 
(rounded) for FY 2026. 
IV. OMOR Fee Calculations 
Under section 744M(a)(2)(A) of the 
FD&C Act, each person that submits a 
qualifying OMOR shall be subject to a 
fee for an OMOR. The amount of such 
fee shall be: 
(1) For a Tier 1 OMOR, $500,000, 
adjusted for inflation for the FY (see 
section 744M(a)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C 
Act); and 
(2) For a Tier 2 OMOR, $100,000, 
adjusted for inflation for the FY (see 
section 744M(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the FD&C 
Act). 
In addition, under section 
744M(c)(1)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act and for 
purposes of section 744M(a)(2) of the 
FD&C Act, the inflation adjustment for 
the FY 2026 OMOR fee shall be equal 
to the product of: 
(1) the fee for FY 2025 under section 
744M(a)(2) of the FD&C (as in effect 
during OMUFA I); and 
(2) the inflation adjustment 
percentage under subparagraph (C) of 
section 744M(c)(1) of the FD&C Act. 
Therefore, for FY 2026, the base of 
OMOR fees taken from the preceding FY 
(i.e., FY 2025) are: Tier 1: $559,777 and Tier 2: $111,955. The FY 2026 inflation 
adjustment percentage is: 4.9576 
percent.

check or wire transfer, payable to the 
order of the Food and Drug 
Administration. The preferred payment 
method is online using electronic check 
(Automated Clearing House (ACH) also 
known as eCheck). FDA has partnered 
with the U.S. Department of the 
Treasury to utilize Pay.gov, a web-based 
payment application, for online 
electronic payment. The Pay.gov feature is available on the FDA website after 
completing the OTC Monograph User 
Fee Cover Sheet and generating the user 
fee ID number. 
Secure electronic payments can be 
submitted using the User Fees Payment 
Portal at https://userfees.fda.gov/pay. (Note: Only full payments are accepted; no partial payments can be made 
online). Once an invoice is located, 
‘‘Pay Now’’ should be selected to be 
redirected to Pay.gov. Electronic 
payment options are based on the 
balance due.

For payments made by wire transfer, 
include the unique user fee ID number 
to ensure that the payment is applied to 
the correct fee(s). Without the unique 
user fee ID number, the payment may 
not be applied, which could result in 
FDA not filing an OMOR request, or 
other consequences of nonpayment. The 
originating financial institution may 
charge a wire transfer fee. Include 
applicable wire transfer fees with 
payment to ensure fees are fully paid. 
Questions about wire transfer fees 
should be addressed to the financial 
institution. The following account 
information should be used to send

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
The Drug Price Competition and 
Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 
(Pub. L. 98–417) and the Generic 
Animal Drug and Patent Term 
Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100–670) 
generally provide that a patent may be 
extended for a period of up to 5 years 
so long as the patented item (human 
drug or biological product, animal drug 
product, medical device, food additive, 
or color additive) was subject to 
regulatory review by FDA before the 
item was marketed. Under these acts, a 
product’s regulatory review period 
forms the basis for determining the 
amount of extension an applicant may 
receive. 
A regulatory review period consists of 
two periods of time: a testing phase and 
an approval phase. For human drug 
products, the testing phase begins when 
the exemption to permit the clinical 
investigations of the drug becomes 
effective and runs until the approval 
phase begins. The approval phase starts 
with the initial submission of an 
application to market the human drug 
product and continues until FDA grants 
permission to market the drug product. 
Although only a portion of a regulatory 
review period may count toward the 
actual amount of extension that the 
Director of USPTO may award (for 
example, half the testing phase must be 
subtracted as well as any time that may 
have occurred before the patent was 
issued), FDA’s determination of the 
length of a regulatory review period for 
a human drug product will include all 
of the testing phase and approval phase 
as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B). 
FDA has approved for marketing the 
human drug product, ROMVIMZA 
(vimseltinib), indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with 
symptomatic tenosynovial giant cell 
tumor (TGCT) for which surgical 
resection will potentially cause 
worsening functional limitation or 
severe morbidity. Subsequent to this 
approval, the USPTO received a patent 
term restoration application for 
ROMVIMZA (U.S. Patent No. 9,181,223) 
from Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC 
and the USPTO requested FDA’s 
assistance in determining the patent’s 
eligibility for patent term restoration. In 
a letter dated June 27, 2025, FDA 
advised the USPTO that this human 
drug product had undergone a 
regulatory review period and that the 
approval of ROMVIMZA represented 
the first permitted commercial 
marketing or use of the product. 
Thereafter, the USPTO requested that 
FDA determine the product’s regulatory 
review period. 
II. Determination of Regulatory Review 
Period 
FDA has determined that the 
applicable regulatory review period for 
ROMVIMZA is 3,020 days. Of this time, 
2,777 days occurred during the testing 
phase of the regulatory review period, 
while 243 days occurred during the 
approval phase. These periods of time 
were derived from the following dates: 
1. The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 
355(i)) became effective: November 10, 
2016. FDA has verified the applicant’s 
claim that the date the investigational 
new drug application became effective 
was on November 10, 2016. 
2. The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the 
human drug product under section 505 
of the FD&C Act: June 17, 2024. FDA 
has verified the applicant’s claim that 
the new drug application (NDA) for 
ROMVIMZA (NDA 219304) was initially 
submitted on June 17, 2024. 
3. The date the application was approved: February 14, 2025. FDA has verified the applicant’s claim that NDA 
219304 was approved on February 14, 
2025. 
This determination of the regulatory 
review period establishes the maximum 
potential length of a patent extension. 
However, the USPTO applies several 
statutory limitations in its calculations 
of the actual period for patent extension. 
In its application(s) for patent extension, 
this applicant seeks 1,632 days of patent 
term extension. 
III. Petitions 
Anyone with knowledge that any of 
the dates as published are incorrect may 
submit either electronic or written 
comments and, under 21 CFR 60.24, ask 
for a redetermination (see 
DATES). 
Furthermore, as specified in § 60.30 (21 
CFR 60.30), any interested person may 
petition FDA for a determination 
regarding whether the applicant for 
extension acted with due diligence 
during the regulatory review period. To 
meet its burden, the petition must 
comply with all the requirements of 
§ 60.30, including but not limited to: 
must be timely (see 
DATES), must be 
filed in accordance with § 10.20, must 
contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA 
investigation, and must certify that a 
true and complete copy of the petition 
has been served upon the patent 
applicant. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th 
Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41–42, 1984.) 
Petitions should be in the format 
specified in 21 CFR 10.30.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In compliance with 44 U.S.C. 3507, FDA 
has submitted the following proposed 
collection of information to OMB for 
review and clearance. 
Current Good Manufacturing Practices 
for Positron Emission Tomography 
Drugs—21 CFR Part 212 
OMB Control Number 0910–0667— 
Extension 
This information collection 
implements statutory and regulatory 
requirements that govern positron 
emission tomography (PET) drugs. FDA 
has promulgated regulations in 21 CFR 
part 212 establishing current good 
manufacturing practice (CGMP) 
intended to ensure that PET drugs meet 
the requirements of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) 
regarding safety, identity, strength, 
quality, and purity. While regulations in 
21 CFR part 212, subpart A set forth 
general provisions, additional 
requirements are established in 21 CFR 
part 212 as follows: 
Subpart B—Personnel and Resources— 
212.10 
Subpart C—Quality Assurance—212.20 
Subpart D—Facilities and Equipment— 
212.30 
Subpart E—Control of Components, 
Containers, and Closures—212.40 
Subpart F—Production and Process 
Controls—212.50 
Subpart G—Laboratory Controls—212.60– 
212.61 
Subpart H—Finished Drug Product Controls 
and Acceptance—212.70–212.71 
Subpart I—Packaging and Labeling—212.80 
Subpart J—Distribution—212.90 
Subpart K—Complaint Handling—212.100 
Subpart L—Records—212.110 
Records must be maintained at the 
PET drug production facility or another 
location that is reasonably accessible to 
responsible officials of the production 
facility and to employees of FDA 
designated to perform inspections. All 
records, including those not stored at 
the inspected establishment, must be 
legible, stored to prevent deterioration 
or loss, and readily available for review 
and copying by FDA employees. All 
records and documentation referenced 
in this part must be maintained for a 
period of at least 1 year from the date 
of final release, including conditional 
final release, of a PET drug product. 
The regulations contain what we 
believe are the minimum standards for 
quality production of PET drugs at all 
types of PET drug production facilities. 
These CGMP requirements are designed 
according to the unique characteristics 
of PET drugs, including their short half- 
lives and because most PET drugs are 
produced at locations close to the 
patients to whom the drugs are 
administered. We have also taken into 
account that time spent on recording 
procedures, processes, and 
specifications may be somewhat higher 
in the year in which records are first 
established and correspondingly lower 
in subsequent years, when only updates 
and revisions will be required. 
We have also issued Agency guidance 
entitled, ‘‘PET Drugs—Current Good 
Manufacturing Practice (CGMP),’’ 
(December 2009), available for

guidance document addresses resources, 
procedures, and documentation for all 
PET drug production facilities,

cases, the guidance provides practical 
examples of methods or procedures that 
PET drug production facilities can use 
to comply with the CGMP requirements.

facilities, including academic or 
hospital facilities as well as commercial 
facilities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
The Drug Price Competition and 
Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 
(Pub. L. 98–417) and the Generic 
Animal Drug and Patent Term 
Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100–670) 
generally provide that a patent may be 
extended for a period of up to 5 years 
so long as the patented item (human 
drug or biologic product, animal drug 
product, medical device, food additive, 
or color additive) was subject to 
regulatory review by FDA before the 
item was marketed. Under these acts, a 
product’s regulatory review period 
forms the basis for determining the 
amount of extension applicants may 
receive. 
A regulatory review period consists of 
two periods of time: a testing phase and 
an approval phase. For human 
biological products, the testing phase 
begins when the exemption to permit 
the clinical investigations of the 
biological product becomes effective 
and runs until the approval phase 
begins. The approval phase starts with 
the initial submission of an application 
to market the human biological product 
and continues until FDA grants 
permission to market the biological 
product. Although only a portion of a 
regulatory review period may count 
toward the actual amount of extension 
that the Director of USPTO may award 
(for example, half the testing phase must 
be subtracted as well as any time that 
may have occurred before the patent 
was issued), FDA’s determination of the 
length of a regulatory review period for 
a human biological product will include 
all of the testing phase and approval 
phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 
156(g)(1)(B). 
FDA has approved for marketing the 
human biologic product ADZYNMA 
(ADAMTS13, recombinant-krhn). 
ADZYNMA is indicated for 
prophylactic or on-demand enzyme 
replacement therapy (ERT) in adult and 
pediatric patients with congenital 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 
(cTTP). Subsequent to this approval, the 
USPTO received patent term restoration 
applications for ADZYNMA (U.S. Patent 
Nos. 7,517,522; 8,623,352; 9,351,935; 
9,572,778; 10,758,599) from Regents of 
the University of Michigan and Takeda 
Pharmaceutical Company Limited, and 
the USPTO requested FDA’s assistance 
in determining the patents’ eligibility 
for patent term restoration. In a letter 
dated June 27, 2025, FDA advised the 
USPTO that this human biological 
product had undergone a regulatory 
review period and that the approval of 
ADZYNMA represented the first 
permitted commercial marketing or use 
of the product. Thereafter, the USPTO 
requested that FDA determine the 
product’s regulatory review period. 
II. Determination of Regulatory Review 
Period 
FDA has determined that the 
applicable regulatory review period for 
ADZYNMA is 4,059 days. Of this time, 
3,821 days occurred during the testing 
phase of the regulatory review period, 
while 238 days occurred during the 
approval phase. These periods of time 
were derived from the following dates: 
1. The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(i)) 
became effective: September 30, 2012. 
Regents of the University of Michigan 
claims that September 28, 2012, is the 
date the investigational new drug 
application (IND) became effective. 
Takeda Pharmaceutical Company 
Limited claims that September 29, 2012, 
is the date the investigational new drug 
application (IND) became effective. 
However, FDA records indicate that the 
IND effective date was September 30, 
2012, which was the first date after 
receipt of the IND that the 
investigational studies were allowed to 
proceed. 
2. The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the 
human biological product under section 
351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 262): March 17, 2023. FDA has 
verified the applicants’ claim that the 
biologics license application (BLA) for 
ADZYNMA (BLA 125795) was initially 
submitted on March 17, 2023. 
3. The date the application was approved: November 9, 2023. FDA has verified the applicants’ claim that BLA 
125795 was approved on November 9, 
2023. 
This determination of the regulatory 
review period establishes the maximum 
potential length of a patent extension. 
However, the USPTO applies several 
statutory limitations in its calculations 
of the actual period for patent extension. 
In its application for patent extension, 
the applicants seek 702, 1,346, 1,479,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
The Drug Price Competition and 
Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 
(Pub. L. 98–417) and the Generic 
Animal Drug and Patent Term 
Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100–670) 
generally provide that a patent may be 
extended for a period of up to 5 years 
so long as the patented item (human 
drug or biologic product, animal drug 
product, medical device, food additive, 
or color additive) was subject to 
regulatory review by FDA before the 
item was marketed. Under these acts, a 
product’s regulatory review period 
forms the basis for determining the 
amount of extension an applicant may 
receive. 
A regulatory review period consists of 
two periods of time: a testing phase and 
an approval phase. For human 
biological products, the testing phase 
begins when the exemption to permit 
the clinical investigations of the 
biological product becomes effective 
and runs until the approval phase 
begins. The approval phase starts with 
the initial submission of an application 
to market the human biological product 
and continues until FDA grants 
permission to market the biological 
product. Although only a portion of a 
regulatory review period may count 
toward the actual amount of extension 
that the Director of USPTO may award 
(for example, half the testing phase must 
be subtracted as well as any time that 
may have occurred before the patent 
was issued), FDA’s determination of the 
length of a regulatory review period for 
a human biological product will include 
all of the testing phase and approval 
phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 
156(g)(1)(B). 
FDA has approved for marketing the 
human biologic product ALHEMO 
(concizumab-mtci). ALHEMO is 
indicated for routine prophylaxis to 
prevent or reduce the frequency of 
bleeding episodes in adult and pediatric 
patients 12 years of age and older with: 
€hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) with FVIII inhibitors 
€hemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency) with FIX inhibitors 
Subsequent to this approval, the USPTO 
received a patent term restoration 
application for ALHEMO (U.S. Patent 
No. 8,361,469) from Novo Nordisk A/S, 
and the USPTO requested FDA’s 
assistance in determining this patent’s 
eligibility for patent term restoration. In 
a letter dated June 27, 2025, FDA 
advised the USPTO that this human 
biological product had undergone a 
regulatory review period and that the 
approval of ALHEMO represented the 
first permitted commercial marketing or 
use of the product. Thereafter, the 
USPTO requested that FDA determine 
the product’s regulatory review period. 
II. Determination of Regulatory Review 
Period 
FDA has determined that the 
applicable regulatory review period for 
ALHEMO is 3,475 days. Of this time, 
2,625 days occurred during the testing 
phase of the regulatory review period, 
while 850 days occurred during the 
approval phase. These periods of time 
were derived from the following dates: 
1. The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(i)) 
became effective: June 18, 2015. FDA 
has verified the applicant’s claim that 
the date the investigational new drug 
application became effective was on 
June 18, 2015 
2. The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the 
human biological product under section 
351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 262): August 24, 2022. FDA has 
verified the applicant’s claim that the 
biologics license application (BLA) for 
ALHEMO (BLA 761315) was initially 
submitted on August 24, 2022. 
3. The date the application was approved: December 20, 2024. FDA has verified the applicant’s claim that BLA 
761315 was approved on December 20, 
2024. 
This determination of the regulatory 
review period establishes the maximum 
potential length of a patent extension. 
However, the USPTO applies several 
statutory limitations in its calculations 
of the actual period for patent extension. 
In its application for patent extension, 
this applicant seeks 1,826 days of patent 
term extension. 
III. Petitions 
Anyone with knowledge that any of 
the dates as published are incorrect may 
submit either electronic or written 
comments and, under 21 CFR 60.24, ask 
for a redetermination (see 
DATES). 
Furthermore, as specified in § 60.30 (21 
CFR 60.30), any interested person may 
petition FDA for a determination 
regarding whether the applicant for 
extension acted with due diligence 
during the regulatory review period. To 
meet its burden, the petition must 
comply with all the requirements of 
§ 60.30, including but not limited to: 
must be timely (see 
DATES), must be 
filed in accordance with § 10.20, must 
contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA 
investigation, and must certify that a 
true and complete copy of the petition 
has been served upon the patent 
applicant. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th 
Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41–42, 1984.) 
Petitions should be in the format 
specified in 21 CFR 10.30.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Statutory Background 
The FD&C Act, as amended, 
establishes a comprehensive system for 
the regulation of medical devices 
intended for human use. Section 513 of 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c) 
establishes three classes of devices, 
reflecting the regulatory controls needed 
to provide reasonable assurance of their 
safety and effectiveness. The three 
classes of devices are class I (general 
controls), class II (special controls), and 
class III (premarket approval). 
Section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act 
defines the three classes of devices. 
Class I devices are those devices for 
which the general controls of the FD&C 
Act (controls authorized by or under 
section 501, 502, 510, 516, 518, 519, or 
520 (21 U.S.C. 351, 352, 360, 360f, 360h, 
360i, or 360j) or any combination of 
such sections) are sufficient to provide 
reasonable assurance of safety and 
effectiveness of the device; or those 
devices for which insufficient 
information exists to determine that 
general controls are sufficient to provide 
reasonable assurance of safety and 
effectiveness or to establish special 
controls to provide such assurance, but 
because the devices are not purported or 
represented to be for a use in supporting 
or sustaining human life or for a use 
which is of substantial importance in 
preventing impairment of human 
health, and do not present a potential 
unreasonable risk of illness or injury, 
are to be regulated by general controls 
(section 513(a)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act). 
Class II devices are those devices for 
which general controls by themselves 
are insufficient to provide reasonable 
assurance of safety and effectiveness, 
but for which there is sufficient 
information to establish special controls 
to provide such assurance, including the 
issuance of performance standards, 
post-market surveillance, patient 
registries, development and 
dissemination of guidelines, 
recommendations, and other 
appropriate actions FDA deems 
necessary to provide such assurance 
(section 513(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act). 
Class III devices are those devices for 
which insufficient information exists to 
determine that general controls and 
special controls would provide a 
reasonable assurance of safety and 
effectiveness, and are purported or 
represented to be for a use in supporting 
or sustaining human life or for a use 
which is of substantial importance in 
preventing impairment of human 
health, or present a potential 
unreasonable risk of illness or injury 
(section 513(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act). 
Under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. 360(k)) and FDA’s 
implementing regulations in part 807 
(21 CFR part 807), persons who propose 
to begin the introduction or delivery for 
introduction into interstate commerce 
for commercial distribution of a device 
intended for human use are required to

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60732 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices submit a premarket notification (510(k)) 
to FDA. The device may not be 
marketed until FDA finds it 
‘‘substantially equivalent’’ within the 
meaning of section 513(i) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(i)) to a legally 
marketed device that does not require 
premarket approval. 
The 21st Century Cures Act (Pub. L. 
114–255) (Cures Act) was signed into 
law on December 13, 2016. Section 3054 
of the Cures Act amended section 
510(m) of the FD&C Act. As amended, 
section 510(m)(1) of the FD&C Act 
requires that within 90 days of the date 
of enactment of the Cures Act, and at 
least once every 5 years thereafter (as 
FDA determines appropriate), FDA 
publish in the Federal Register a notice 
containing a list of each type of class II 
device that FDA determines no longer 
requires a report under section 510(k) of 
the FD&C Act to provide reasonable 
assurance of safety and effectiveness. 
Additionally, section 510(m)(2) of the 
FD&C Act provides that FDA may 
exempt a class II device from the 
requirement to submit a report under 
section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, upon its 
own initiative or a petition of an 
interested person, if FDA determines 
that a report under section 510(k) is not 
necessary to assure the safety and 
effectiveness of the device. FDA must 
publish in the Federal Register notice of 
its intent to exempt the device, or of the 
petition, and provide a 60-calendar-day 
period for public comment. Within 120 
days after the issuance of this notice, 
FDA must publish an order in the 
Federal Register that sets forth its final 
determination regarding the exemption 
of the device that was the subject of the 
notice. If FDA fails to respond to a 
petition under this section within 180 
days of receiving it, the petition shall be 
deemed granted. 
II. Criteria for Exemption 
There are a number of factors FDA 
may consider to determine whether a 
510(k) is necessary to provide 
reasonable assurance of the safety and 
effectiveness of a class II device. These 
factors are discussed in the Federal 
Register of January 21, 1998 (63 FR 3142) and subsequently in the guidance 
the Agency issued on February 19, 1998, 
entitled ‘‘Procedures for Class II Device 
Exemptions from Premarket 
Notification, Guidance for Industry and 
CDRH Staff’’ (available at https://
www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/ 
search-fda-guidance-documents/ 
procedures-class-ii-device-exemptions- 
premarket-notification-guidance- 
industry-and-cdrh-staff). 
Accordingly, FDA generally considers 
the following factors to determine 
whether a report under section 510(k) is 
necessary or if an exemption would be 
appropriate for class II devices: (1) the 
device does not have a significant 
history of false or misleading claims or 
of risks associated with inherent 
characteristics of the device; (2) 
characteristics of the device necessary 
for its safe and effective performance are 
well established; (3) changes in the 
device that could affect safety and 
effectiveness will either (a) be readily 
detectable by users by visual 
examination or other means such as 
routine testing, before causing harm, or 
(b) not materially increase the risk of 
injury, incorrect diagnosis, or ineffective 
treatment; and (4) any changes to the 
device would not be likely to result in 
a change in the device’s classification. 
FDA may also consider that, even when 
exempting devices from the 510(k) 
requirements, these devices would still 
be subject to the general limitations on 
exemptions (see 21 CFR 892.9). 
III. Proposed Class II Device 
Exemptions 
FDA has received the following 
petition requesting partial exemption 
from the premarket notification 
requirements for certain class II devices: 
Nancy Stade, J.D., of Rubrum Advising, 
LLC, 404 Pembroke Rd., Bala Cynwyd, 
PA 19004, on behalf of Harrison.ai, for 
the following devices: 
€Radiological computer-assisted diagnostic software for lesions 
suspicious of cancer, classified under 
§ 892.2060 (21 CFR 892.2060), product 
code POK. 
€Medical image analyzer, classified under § 892.2070 (21 CFR 892.2070), 
product code MYN. 
€Radiological computer aided triage and notification software, classified 
under § 892.2080 (21 CFR 892.2080), 
product codes QAS and QFM. 
€Radiological computer-assisted detection and diagnosis software, 
classified under § 892.2090 (21 CFR 
892.2090), product codes QBS and 
QDQ. 
The petition requests exemption from 
the premarket notification requirements 
for these devices when: 
€The manufacturer has previously obtained a 510(k); 
€For devices under § 892.2080, the manufacturer must have at least one 
clearance under the same classification 
regulation; 
€For devices under § 892.2060, 892.2070, or 892.2090, the manufacturer 
must have at least one clearance under 
any of those same three classification 
regulations; 
€The manufacturer must implement a robust post-market plan, transparency, 
and training measures as described in 
the petition; and 
€All existing special controls, quality systems, establishment registration, and 
device listing requirements will remain 
in force. 
FDA seeks comment on the petition in 
accordance with section 510(m)(2) of 
the FD&C Act. 
IV. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995

Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration 
Agency Information Collection 
Activities: Submission for OMB 
Review; Comment Request 
Periodically, the Substance Abuse and 
Mental Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA) will publish a summary of 
information collection requests under 
the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) review, in compliance with the 
Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 
Chapter 35). To request a copy of these 
documents, call the SAMHSA Reports 
Clearance Officer on (240) 276–0661. 
Project: Extension to SAMHSA’s 0930– 
0393 Fast Track Generic Clearance for 
the Collection of Qualitative Feedback 
on the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA) Service Delivery 
Executive Order 12862 directs Federal 
agencies to provide service to the public 
that matches or exceeds the best service 
available in the private sector. In order 
to work continuously to ensure that our 
programs are effective and meet our 
customers’ needs, SAMHSA seeks to 
obtain the OMB approval of a generic 
clearance to collect qualitative feedback 
on our service delivery. By qualitative 
feedback we mean information that 
provides useful insights on perceptions 
and opinions but are not statistical 
surveys that yield quantitative results 
that can be generalized to the 
population of study. 
This collection of information is 
necessary to enable SAMHSA to garner 
customer and stakeholder feedback in 
an efficient, timely manner, in 
accordance with our commitment to 
improving service delivery. The 
information collected from our 
customers and stakeholders will help 
ensure that users have an effective, 
efficient, and satisfying experience with 
SAMHSA’s programs. This feedback 
will provide insights into customer or 
stakeholder perceptions, experiences 
and expectations, provide an early 
warning of issues with service, or focus 
attention on areas where 
communication, training or changes in 
operations might improve delivery of 
products or services. These collections 
will allow for ongoing, collaborative and 
actionable communications between 
SAMHSA and its customers and 
stakeholders. It will also allow feedback 
to contribute directly to the 
improvement of program management. 
This is an extension to the currently 
approved 0930–0393 Fast Track Generic 
Clearance for the Collection of 
Qualitative Feedback on SAMHSA 
Service Delivery which replaced 
multiple previously approved SAMHSA 
information collections including 0930– 
0197 Voluntary Customer Satisfaction 
Surveys to Implement Executive Order 
12862 in SAMHSA, 0930–0196 
Pretesting of Substance Abuse 
Prevention and Treatment and Mental 
Health Services Communications 
Messages, and 0930–0313 SAMHSA’s 
Publications and Digital Products 
website Registration Survey. Changes 
were not made to this Information 
Collection Request from the previous 
approval. The information collections 
(ICs) under Generic collections 0930– 
0196 and 0930–0197 were transferred to 
the Fast Track Generic. After the IC 
transferred, the 0196 and 0197 Generic 
collections were discontinued. The 
0930–0313 SAMHSA’s Publications and 
Digital Products website Registration 
Survey consisted of customer 
satisfaction/feedback questions along 
with a SAMHSA website survey and a 
SAMHSA store survey developed 
utilizing the main pool of questions. 
The 0930–0313 information collection 
became an IC under the new Fast Track 
once it was approved and the 0313- 
information collection request (ICR) was 
discontinued. SAMHSA will continue 
due diligence to improve efficiency and 
lower burden by determining if other 
information collections are better served 
by becoming part of the Fast Track 
Generic. 
A variety of instruments and 
platforms will be used to collect 
information from respondents. The 
annual burden hours requested (60,250) 
are based on the number of collections 
we expect to conduct over the requested 
period for this clearance. The burden 
estimates were calculated based on 
replacing previously approved burden 
hours for ICRs 0930–0197, 0930–0196 
and 0930–0313 and internal 
assessments of projected IC submission 
over the next three years.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with the PRA of 1995 (44

1320.8(d)(1), we provide the general 
public and other Federal agencies with 
an opportunity to comment on new, 
proposed, revised, and continuing 
collections of information. This helps us 
assess the impact of our information 
collection requirements and minimize 
the public’s reporting burden. It also 
helps the public understand our 
information collection requirements and 
provide the requested data in the 
desired format. 
A Federal Register notice with a 60- day public comment period soliciting 
comments on this collection of 
information was published on July 23, 
2025 (90 FR 34670). No comments were 
received. 
As part of our continuing effort to 
reduce paperwork and respondent 
burdens, we are again soliciting 
comments from the public and other 
Federal agencies on the proposed ICR 
that is described below. We are 
especially interested in public 
comments addressing the following: 
(1) Whether or not the collection of 
information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the 
agency, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; 
(2) The accuracy of our estimate of the 
burden for this collection of 
information, including the validity of 
the methodology and assumptions used; 
(3) Ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; and 
(4) How the agency might minimize 
the burden of the collection of 
information on those who are to 
respond, including using appropriate 
automated, electronic, mechanical, or 
other technological collection 
techniques or other forms of information 
technology, e.g., permitting electronic submission of response. 
Comments that you submit in 
response to this notice are a matter of 
public record. Before including your 
address, phone number, email address, 
or other personally identifiable 
information (PII) in your comment, you 
should be aware that your entire 
comment—including your PII—may be 
made publicly available at any time. 
While you can ask us in your comment 
to withhold your PII from public review, 
we cannot guarantee that we will be 
able to do so. 
Abstract: This notice concerns the collection of information that is 
sufficient and relevant to evaluate and 
select proposals for funding under the 
NGGDPP. We will accept proposals 
from state geological surveys requesting 
funds to inventory and assess the 
condition of current collections and 
data preservation needs. Financial 
assistance will be awarded annually on 
a competitive basis following the 
evaluation and ranking of state 
proposals by a review panel composed 
of representatives from the U.S. 
Department of the Interior, state

[Investigation Nos. 731–TA–986–987 (Fourth 
Review)] 
Ferrovanadium From China and South 
Africa; Scheduling of Expedited Five- 
Year Reviews 
AGENCY: United States International Trade Commission. 
ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Commission hereby gives notice of the scheduling of expedited 
reviews pursuant to the Tariff Act of 
1930 (‘‘the Act’’) to determine whether 
revocation of the antidumping duty 
orders on ferrovanadium from China 
and South Africa would be likely to lead 
to continuation or recurrence of material 
injury within a reasonably foreseeable 
time. 
DATES: November 24, 2025. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Alec Resch (202–708–1448), Office of 
Investigations, U.S. International Trade 
Commission, 500 E Street SW,

impairments who will need special 
assistance in gaining access to the 
Commission should contact the Office 
of the Secretary at 202–205–2000. 
General information concerning the 
Commission may also be obtained by 
accessing its internet server (https://
www.usitc.gov). The public record for 
this proceeding may be viewed on the 
Commission’s electronic docket (EDIS) 
at https://edis.usitc.gov. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background.—On November 24, 2025, 
the Commission determined that the 
domestic interested party group 
response to its notice of institution (90 
FR 28774, July 1, 2025) of the subject 
five-year reviews was adequate and that 
the respondent interested party group 
response was inadequate. The 
Commission did not find any other 
circumstances that would warrant 
conducting full reviews.
1
Accordingly, 
the Commission determined that it 
would conduct expedited reviews 
pursuant to section 751(c)(3) of the Act 
(19 U.S.C. 1675(c)(3)). 
For further information concerning 
the conduct of these reviews and rules 
of general application, consult the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice and 
Procedure, part 201, subparts A and B 
(19 CFR part 201), and part 207, 
subparts A, D, E, and F (19 CFR part 
207). 
Staff report.—A staff report 
containing information concerning the 
subject matter of the reviews has been 
placed in the nonpublic record, and will 
be made available to persons on the 
Administrative Protective Order service 
list for these reviews on January 30, 
2026. A public version will be issued 
thereafter, pursuant to § 207.62(d)(4) of 
the Commission’s rules. 
Written submissions.—As provided in 
§ 207.62(d) of the Commission’s rules, 
interested parties that are parties to the 
reviews and that have provided 
individually adequate responses to the 
notice of institution,
2
and any party 
other than an interested party to the 
reviews may file written comments with 
the Secretary on what determination the 
Commission should reach in the 
reviews. Comments are due on or before 
February 4, 2026 and may not contain 
new factual information. Any person 
that is neither a party to the five-year 
reviews nor an interested party may 
submit a brief written statement (which 
shall not contain any new factual 
information) pertinent to the reviews by 
February 4, 2026. However, should the 
Department of Commerce (‘‘Commerce’’) 
extend the time limit for its completion 
of the final results of its reviews, the 
deadline for comments (which may not 
contain new factual information) on 
Commerce’s final results is three 
business days after the issuance of 
Commerce’s results. If comments 
contain business proprietary 
information (BPI), they must conform 
with the requirements of §§ 201.6, 
207.3, and 207.7 of the Commission’s 
rules. The Commission’s Handbook on 
Filing Procedures, available on the 
Commission’s website at https://
www.usitc.gov/documents/handbook_
on_filing_procedures.pdf, elaborates upon the Commission’s procedures with 
respect to filings. 
In accordance with §§ 201.16(c) and 
207.3 of the rules, each document filed 
by a party to the reviews must be served 
on all other parties to the reviews (as 
identified by either the public or BPI 
service list), and a certificate of service 
must be timely filed. The Secretary will 
not accept a document for filing without 
a certificate of service. 
Determination.—The Commission has 
determined these reviews are 
extraordinarily complicated and 
therefore has determined to exercise its 
authority to extend the review period by 
up to 90 days pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 
1675(c)(5)(B). 
Authority:—These reviews are being 
conducted under authority of title VII of 
the Tariff Act of 1930; this notice is 
published pursuant to § 207.62 of the 
Commission’s rules. 
By order of the Commission.

I. Overview 
On April 1, 2024, CBNA/Halmar Joint 
Venture (CBNA/Halmar or the 
applicant), submitted under Section 6(d) 
of the Occupational Safety and Health 
Act of 1970 (the Act), 29 U.S.C. 655, and 
29 CFR 1905.11 (Variances and other 
relief under Section 6(d)) an application 
for a permanent variance from several 
provisions of the OSHA standard that 
regulates work in compressed air, 
1926.803 of 1926 Subpart S— 
Underground Construction, Caissons, 
Cofferdams, and Compressed Air, and 
an interim order allowing it to proceed 
while OSHA considers the request for a 
permanent variance (OSHA–2025– 
0002–0002). This notice addresses 
CBNA/Halmar’s application for a 
permanent variance and interim order 
for construction of the Potomac River 
Tunnel Project in Washington, DC only 
and is not applicable to future CBNA/ 
Halmar Joint Venture tunneling projects. 
This notice addresses CBNA/Halmar’s 
application for a permanent variance 
and interim order from the provisions of 
the standard that: (1) require the use of 
the decompression values specified in 
decompression tables in Appendix A of 
subpart S (29 CFR 1926.803(f)(1)); and 
(2) require the use of automated 
operational controls and a special 
decompression chamber (29 CFR 
1926.803(g)(1)(iii) and (xvii), 
respectively). 
OSHA reviewed CBNA/Halmar’s 
application for the variance and interim 
order and determined that they were 
appropriately submitted in compliance 
with the applicable variance procedures 
in Section 6(d) of the Occupational 
Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act; 
29 U.S.C. 655) and OSHA’s regulations 
at 29 CFR 1905.11 (Variances and other 
relief under section 6(d)), including the 
requirement that the applicant inform 
workers and their representatives of 
their rights to petition the Assistant 
Secretary of Labor for Occupational 
Safety and Health for a hearing on the 
variance application. 
OSHA reviewed the alternative 
procedures in CBNA/Halmar’s 
application and preliminarily 
determined that the applicant’s 
proposed alternatives, on the whole, 
subject to the conditions in the request 
and imposed by the interim order, 
provide measures that are as safe and 
healthful as those required by the cited 
OSHA standards. On July 24, 2025, 
OSHA published a Federal Register 
notice announcing CBNA/Halmar’s 
application for permanent variance, 
stating the preliminary determination 
along with the basis of that 
determination, and granting the interim 
order (90 FR 34902). OSHA requested 
comments on each. 
OSHA did not receive any comments 
or other information disputing the 
preliminary determination that the 
alternatives were at least as safe as 
OSHA’s standard, nor any objections to 
OSHA granting a permanent variance. 
Accordingly, through this notice OSHA 
grants a permanent variance, subject to 
the conditions set out in this document. 
A. Background 
The information that follows about 
CBNA/Halmar, its methods, and the 
Potomac River Tunnel Project comes 
from the CBNA/Halmar variance 
application. 
CBNA/Halmar is a contractor for the 
Potomac River Tunnel Project (the 
project), that works on complex tunnel 
projects using innovations in tunnel- 
excavation methods. The applicant’s 
workers engage in the construction of 
tunnels using advanced shielded 
mechanical excavation techniques in 
conjunction with an earth pressure 
balanced micro-tunnel boring machine 
(TBM). Using shielded mechanical 
excavation techniques, in conjunction 
with precast concrete tunnel liners and 
backfill grout, TBMs provide methods to 
achieve the face pressures required to 
maintain a stabilized tunnel face 
through various geologies and isolate 
that pressure to the forward section (the 
working chamber) of the TBM. 
CBNA/Halmar asserts that it bores 
tunnels using a TBM at levels below the 
water table through soft soils consisting 
of clay, silt, and sand. TBMs are capable 
of maintaining pressure at the tunnel 
face, and stabilizing existing geological 
conditions, through the controlled use 
of a mechanically driven cutter head, 
bulkheads within the shield, ground- 
treatment foam, and a screw conveyor 
that moves excavated material from the 
working chamber. The forward-most 
portion of the TBM is the working 
chamber, and this chamber is the only 
pressurized segment of the TBM. Within 
the shield, the working chamber 
consists of two sections: the forward 
working chamber and the staging 
chamber. The forward working chamber 
is immediately behind the cutter head 
and tunnel face. The staging chamber is 
behind the forward working chamber 
and between the man-lock door and the 
entry door to the forward working 
chamber. 
The TBM has twin man-locks located 
between the pressurized working 
chamber and the non-pressurized 
portion of the machine. Each man-lock 
has two compartments. This 
configuration allows workers to access 
the man-locks for compression and 
decompression, and medical personnel 
to access the man-locks if required in an 
emergency. 
CBNA/Halmar’s Hyperbaric 
Operations Manual (HOM) for the 
Potomac River Tunnel Project indicates 
that the maximum pressure to which it 
is likely to expose workers during 
project interventions for the tunnel 
drives is 49.5 pounds per square inch 
gauge (p.s.i.g.). The applicant will 
pressurize the working chamber to the 
level required to maintain a stable 
tunnel face, which for this project 
CBNA/Halmar estimates will be up to a 
pressure not exceeding 49.5 p.s.i.g., 
which does not exceed the maximum 
pressure specified by the OSHA 
standard at 29 CFR 1926.803(e)(5).

CBNA/Halmar is not seeking a variance 
from this provision of the compressed- 
air standard. 
CBNA/Halmar employs specially 
trained personnel for the construction of 
the tunnel. To keep the machinery 
working effectively, CBNA/Halmar 
asserts that these workers must 
periodically enter the excavation 
working chamber of the TBM to perform 
hyperbaric interventions during which 
workers would be exposed to air 
pressures up to 49.5 p.s.i.g, which does 
not exceed the maximum pressure 
specified by the existing OSHA standard 
at 29 CFR 1926.803(e)(5). These 
interventions consist of conducting 
inspections or maintenance work on the 
cutter-head structure and cutting tools 
of the TBM, such as changing 
replaceable cutting tools and disposable 
wear bars, and, in rare cases, repairing 
structural damage to the cutter head.

The previous tunnel construction variances 
allowed further deviation from OSHA standards by 
permitting employee exposures above 50 p.s.i.g., 
based on the composition of the soil and the 
amount of water that will be above the tunnel for 
various sections of this project. The current 
permanent variance includes substantively the 
same safeguards as the variances that OSHA granted 
previously even though employees will not be 
exposed to pressures higher than 49.5 p.s.i.g.

In 1992, the French Ministry of Labour replaced 
the 1974 French Decompression Tables with the 
These interventions are the only time 
that workers are exposed to compressed 
air. Interventions in the excavation 
working chamber (the pressurized 
portion of the TBM) take place only 
after halting tunnel excavation and 
preparing the machine and crew for an 
intervention. 
During interventions, workers enter 
the working chamber through one of the 
twin man-locks that open into the 
staging chamber. To reach the forward 
part of the working chamber, workers 
pass through a door in a bulkhead that 
separates the staging chamber from the 
forward working chamber. The man- 
locks and the working chamber are 
designed to accommodate three people, 
which is the maximum crew size 
allowed under the permanent variance. 
When the required decompression times 
are greater than work times, the twin 
man-locks allow for crew rotation. 
During crew rotation, one crew can be 
compressing or decompressing while 
the second crew is working. Therefore, 
the working crew always has an 
unoccupied man-lock at its disposal. 
CBNA/Halmar asserts that these 
innovations in tunnel excavation have 
greatly reduced worker exposure to 
hazards of pressurized air work because 
they have eliminated the need to 
pressurize the entire tunnel for the 
project and thereby reduce the number 
of workers exposed, as well as the total 
duration of exposure, to hyperbaric 
pressure during tunnel construction. 
These advances in technology have 
substantially modified the methods 
used by the construction industry to 
excavate subaqueous tunnels compared 
to the caisson work regulated by the 
current OSHA compressed-air standard 
for construction at 29 CFR 1926.803. 
In addition to the reduced exposures 
resulting from the innovations in 
tunnel-excavation methods, CBNA/ 
Halmar asserts that innovations in 
hyperbaric medicine and technology 
improve the safety of decompression 
from hyperbaric exposures. These 
procedures, however, deviate from the 
decompression process that OSHA 
requires for construction in 29 CFR 
1926.803(f)(1) and the decompression 
tables in Appendix A of 29 CFR 1926, 
subpart S. Nevertheless, according to 
CBNA/Halmar, their use of 
decompression protocols incorporating 
oxygen is more efficient, effective, and 
safer for tunnel workers than 
compliance with the decompression 
tables specified by the existing OSHA 
standard. 
CBNA/Halmar contends that the 
alternative safety measures included in 
the application provide CBNA/Halmar’s 
workers with a place of employment 
that is at least as safe as they would be 
under OSHA’s compressed-air standard 
for construction. CBNA also provided 
OSHA a project-specific HOM (OSHA– 
2025–0002–0003) for the Potomac River 
Tunnel Project that requires specialized 
medical support and hyperbaric 
supervision to provide assistance to a 
team of specially trained man-lock 
attendants and hyperbaric or 
compressed-air workers to support their 
assertions of equivalency in worker 
protection. 
OSHA included all of the above 
information in the Federal Register 
notice announcing CBNA/Halmar’s 
variance application and did not receive 
any comments disputing any of that 
information, including the safety 
assertions made by CBNA/Halmar in the 
variance application. 
II. The Variance Application 
Pursuant to the requirements of 
OSHA’s variance regulations (29 CFR 
1905.11), the applicant has certified that 
it notified its affected workers
2
of the 
variance application and request for 
interim order by posting, at prominent 
locations where it normally posts 
workplace notices, a summary of the 
application and information specifying 
where the workers can examine a copy 
of the application. In addition, the 
applicant has certified that it informed 
its workers of their right to petition the 
Assistant Secretary of Labor for 
Occupational Safety and Health for a 
hearing on the variance application. 
III. OSHA History of Approval of 
Nearly Identical Variance Requests 
OSHA has previously approved 
several nearly identical variances 
involving the same types of tunneling 
equipment used for similar projects 
(tunnel construction variances). OSHA 
notes that it granted several subaqueous 
tunnel construction permanent 
variances from the same provisions of 
OSHA’s compressed-air standard (29 
CFR 1926.803(e)(5), (f)(1), (g)(1)(iii), and 
(g)(1)(xvii)) that are the subject of the 
present application: (1) Impregilo, 
Healy, Parsons, Joint Venture (IHP JV) 
for the Anacostia River Tunnel in 
Washington, DC (80 FR 50652, August 
20, 2015); (2) Traylor JV for the Blue 
Plains Tunnel in Washington, DC (80 FR

February 7, 2024); and (9) Ballard 
Marine Construction for the Lower 
Olentangy Tunnel Project in Columbus, 
Ohio (89 FR 78906, September 26, 
2024). OSHA also granted an interim 
order to Ballard Marine Construction for 
the Suffolk County, New York Outfall 
Tunnel Project (86 FR 5253, January 19, 
2021), as well as an interim order to 
McNally/ASI Marine for the Southerly 
Tunnel and Consolidation Project in 
Cleveland, Ohio (90 FR 34887, July 24, 
2025) in addition to the interim order 
granted for this project. The proposed 
alternate conditions in this notice are 
nearly identical to the alternate 
conditions of the previous permanent 
variances.

OSHA is not aware of any 
injuries or other safety issues that arose 
from work performed under these 
conditions in accordance with the 
previous variances. 
IV. Applicable OSHA Standard and the 
Relevant Variance 
A. Variance From Paragraph (f)(1) of 29 
CFR 1926.803, Requirement To Use 
OSHA Decompression Tables 
OSHA’s compressed-air standard for 
construction requires decompression in 
accordance with the decompression 
tables in Appendix A of 29 CFR 1926, 
subpart S (see 29 CFR 1926.803(f)(1)). 
As an alternative to the OSHA 
decompression tables, the applicant 
proposes to use newer decompression 
schedules (the 1992 French 
Decompression Tables) that rely on 
staged decompression and supplement 
breathing air used during 
decompression with air or oxygen (as 
appropriate).

The applicant asserts

from OSHA’s decompression tables in Appendix A 
by using: (1) staged decompression as opposed to 
continuous (linear) decompression; (2) 
decompression tables based on air or both air and 
pure oxygen; and (3) emergency tables when 
unexpected exposure times occur (up to 30 minutes 
above the maximum allowed working time). 
5
See, e.g., Dr. Eric Kindwall, EP (1997), Compressed air tunneling and caisson work 
decompression procedures: development, problems, 
and solutions. Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine, 
24(4), pp. 337–345. This article reported 60 treated 
cases of DCI among 4,168 exposures between 19 
and 31 p.s.i.g. over a 51-week contract period, for 
a DCI incidence of 1.44% for the decompression 
tables specified by the OSHA standard. Dr. 
Kindwall notes that the use of automatically 
regulated continuous decompression in the 
Washington State safety standards for compressed- 
air work (from which OSHA derived its 
decompression tables) was at the insistence of 
contractors and the union, and against the advice 
of the expert who calculated the decompression 
table and recommended using staged 
decompression. Dr. Kindwall then states, 
‘‘Continuous decompression is inefficient and 
wasteful. For example, if the last stage from 4 
p.s.i.g.... to the surface took 1h, at least half the 
time is spent at pressures less than 2 p.s.i.g...., 
which provides less and less meaningful bubble 
suppression . . . .’’ In addition, Dr. Kindwall addresses the continuous-decompression protocol 
in the OSHA compressed-air standard for 
construction, noting that ‘‘[a]side from the tables for 
saturation diving to deep depths, no other widely 
used or officially approved diving decompression 
tables use straight line, continuous decompressions 
at varying rates. Stage decompression is usually the 
rule, since it is simpler to control.’’ 
decompression protocols using the 1992 
French Decompression Tables for air or 
oxygen as specified by the Integrated 
Pipeline Tunnel Project-specific HOM 
are safer for tunnel workers than the 
decompression protocols specified in 
Appendix A of 29 CFR 1926 Subpart S. 
Accordingly, the applicant commits to 
following the decompression 
procedures described in that HOM, 
which requires CBNA/Halmar to follow 
the 1992 French Decompression Tables 
to decompress compressed air workers 
(CAWs) after they exit the hyperbaric 
conditions in the working chamber. 
Depending on the maximum working 
pressure and exposure times, the 1992 
French Decompression Tables provide 
for air decompression with or without 
oxygen. CBNA/Halmar asserts that 
oxygen decompression has many 
benefits, including (1) keeping the 
partial pressure of nitrogen in the lungs 
as low as possible; (2) keeping external 
pressure as low as possible to reduce the 
formation of gas bubbles in the blood; 
(3) removing nitrogen from the lungs 
and arterial blood and increasing the 
rate of nitrogen elimination; (4) 
improving the quality of breathing 
during decompression stops so that 
workers are less tired and to prevent 
bone necrosis; (5) reducing 
decompression time by approximately 
33 percent as compared to air 
decompression; and (6) reducing 
inflammation. 
In addition, the project-specific HOM 
requires a physician, certified in 
hyperbaric medicine, to manage the 
medical condition of CAWs during 
hyperbaric exposures and 
decompression. A trained and 
experienced man-lock attendant is also 
required to be present during hyperbaric 
exposures and decompression. This 
man-lock attendant is to operate the 
hyperbaric system to ensure compliance 
with the specified decompression table. 
A hyperbaric supervisor, who is trained 
in hyperbaric operations, procedures, 
and safety, directly oversees all 
hyperbaric interventions, and ensures 
that staff follow the procedures 
delineated in the HOM or by the 
attending physician. 
B. Variance From Paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of 
29 CFR 1926.803, Automatically 
Regulated Continuous Decompression 
CBNA/Halmar seeks a permanent 
variance from the OSHA standard at 29 
CFR 1926.803(g)(1)(iii), which requires 
automatic controls to regulate 
decompression. As noted above, the 
applicant is conducting the staged 
decompression according to the 1992 
French Decompression Tables under the 
direct control of the trained man-lock 
attendant and under the oversight of the 
hyperbaric supervisor. 
Breathing air under hyperbaric 
conditions increases the amount of 
nitrogen gas dissolved in a CAW’s 
tissues. The greater the hyperbaric 
pressure under these conditions and the 
more time spent under the increased 
pressure, the greater the amount of 
nitrogen gas is dissolved in the tissues. 
When the pressure decreases during 
decompression, tissues release the 
dissolved nitrogen gas into the blood 
system, which then carries the nitrogen 
gas to the lungs for elimination through 
exhalation. Releasing hyperbaric 
pressure too rapidly during 
decompression can increase the size of 
the bubbles formed by nitrogen gas in 
the blood system, resulting in 
decompression illness (DCI), commonly 
referred to as ‘‘the bends.’’ This 
description of the etiology of DCI is 
consistent with current scientific theory 
and research on the issue. 
The 1992 French Decompression 
Tables, proposed for use by the 
applicant, provide for stops during 
worker decompression (i.e., staged decompression) to control the release of 
nitrogen gas from tissues into the blood 
system. Studies show that staged 
decompression, in combination with 
other features of the 1992 French 
Decompression Tables such as the use 
of oxygen, result in a lower incidence of 
DCI than the use of automatically 
regulated continuous decompression.
5
 
In addition, the applicant asserts that 
staged decompression administered in 
accordance with its HOM is at least as 
effective as an automatic controller in 
regulating the decompression process 
because the HOM requires a hyperbaric 
supervisor who directly supervises all 
hyperbaric interventions and ensures 
that the man-lock attendant, who is a 
competent person in the manual control 
of hyperbaric systems, follows the 
schedule specified in the 
decompression tables, including stops. 
C. Variance From Paragraph (g)(1)(xvii) 
of 29 CFR 1926.803, Requirement of 
Special Decompression Chamber 
The OSHA compressed-air standard 
for construction requires employers to 
use a special decompression chamber of 
sufficient size to accommodate all 
CAWs being decompressed at the end of 
the shift when total decompression time 
exceeds 75 minutes (see 29 CFR 
1926.803(g)(1)(xvii)). Use of the special 
decompression chamber enables CAWs 
to move about and flex their joints to 
prevent neuromuscular problems during 
decompression. 
Space limitations in the TBM do not 
allow for the installation and use of an 
additional special decompression lock 
or chamber. The applicant proposes that 
it be permitted to rely on the man-locks 
and staging chamber in lieu of adding a 
separate, special decompression 
chamber. Because only a few workers 
out of the entire crew are exposed to 
hyperbaric pressure, the man-locks 
(which, as noted earlier, connect 
directly to the working chamber) and 
the staging chamber are of sufficient size 
to accommodate all of the exposed 
workers during decompression. The 
applicant uses the existing man-locks, 
each of which adequately 
accommodates a three-member crew for 
this purpose when decompression lasts 
up to 75 minutes. When decompression 
exceeds 75 minutes, crews can open the 
door connecting the two compartments 
in each man-lock (during 
decompression stops) or exit the man- 
lock and move into the staging chamber 
where additional space is available. The 
applicant asserts that this alternative 
arrangement is as effective as a special 
decompression chamber in that it has 
sufficient space for all the CAWs at the

OSHA-approved State Plans.’’ Their programs must 
be at least as effective in providing safe and 
healthful employment and places of employment as

V. Decision 
After reviewing the proposed 
alternatives, OSHA has determined that 
the applicant’s proposed alternatives, on 
the whole, subject to the conditions in 
the request and imposed by this 
permanent variance, provide measures 
that are as safe and healthful as those 
required by the cited OSHA standards 
addressed in section IV of this notice. 
In addition, OSHA has determined 
that each of the following alternatives 
are at least as effective as the specified 
OSHA requirements: 
A. 29 CFR 1926.803(f)(1) 
The applicant has proposed to 
implement equally effective alternative 
measures to the requirement in 29 CFR 
1926.803(f)(1) for compliance with 
OSHA’s decompression tables. The 
HOM specifies the procedures and 
personnel qualifications for performing 
work safely during the compression and 
decompression phases of interventions. 
The HOM also specifies the 
decompression tables the applicant 
proposes to use (the 1992 French 
Decompression Tables). Depending on 
the maximum working pressure and 
exposure times during the interventions, 
the tables provide for decompression 
using air, pure oxygen, or a combination 
of air and oxygen. The decompression 
tables also include delays or stops for 
various time intervals at different 
pressure levels during the transition to 
atmospheric pressure (i.e., staged decompression). In all cases, a 
physician certified in hyperbaric 
medicine will manage the medical 
condition of CAWs during 
decompression. In addition, a trained 
and experienced man-lock attendant, 
experienced in recognizing 
decompression sickness or illnesses and 
injuries, will be present. Of key 
importance, a hyperbaric supervisor, 
trained in hyperbaric operations, 
procedures, and safety, will directly 
supervise all hyperbaric operations to 
ensure compliance with the procedures 
delineated in the project-specific HOM 
or by the attending physician. 
Prior to granting the previous 
permanent variances to Traylor JV, IHP 
JV, Tully/OHL JV, Salini-Impregilo/ 
Healy JV, McNally/Kiewit SST JV, 
Traylor Shea JV, McNally/ASI Marine 
and Ballard Marine Bay Park Tunnel 
New York, OSHA conducted a review of 
the scientific literature and concluded 
that the alternative decompression 
method (i.e., the 1992 French Decompression Tables) CBNA/Halmar 
proposed would be at least as safe as the 
decompression tables specified by 
OSHA when applied by trained medical 
personnel under the conditions imposed 
by the permanent variance. 
Some of the literature indicates that 
the alternative decompression method 
may be safer, concluding that 
decompression performed in accordance 
with these tables resulted in a lower 
occurrence of DCI than decompression 
conducted in accordance with the 
decompression tables specified by the 
standard. For example, H.L. Andersen 
studied the occurrence of DCI at 
maximum hyperbaric pressures ranging 
from 4 p.s.i.g. to 43 p.s.i.g. during 
construction of the Great Belt Tunnel in 
Denmark (1992–1996).
6
This project 
used the 1992 French Decompression 
Tables to decompress the workers 
during part of the construction. 
Andersen observed 6 DCI cases out of 
7,220 decompression events and 
reported that switching to the 1992 
French Decompression tables reduced 
the DCI incidence to 0.08% compared to 
a previous incidence rate of 0.14%. The 
DCI incidence in the study by H.L. 
Andersen is substantially less than the 
DCI incidence reported for the 
decompression tables specified in 
Appendix A. 
OSHA found no studies in which the 
DCI incidence reported for the 1992 
French Decompression Tables were 
higher than the DCI incidence reported 
for the OSHA decompression tables.
7
 
OSHA’s experience with the previous 
seven variances, which all incorporated 
nearly identical decompression plans 
and did not result in safety issues, also 
provides evidence that the alternative 
procedure as a whole is at least as 
effective for this type of tunneling 
project as compliance with OSHA’s 
decompression tables. The experience of 
State Plans
8
that granted variances 
(Nevada, Oregon and Washington)
9
for 
hyperbaric exposures occurring during 
similar subaqueous tunnel-construction 
work provide additional evidence of the 
effectiveness of this alternative 
procedure. 
B. 29 CFR 1926.803(g)(1)(iii) 
The applicant developed, and 
proposed to implement, an equally 
effective alternative to 29 CFR 
1926.803(g)(1)(iii), which requires the 
use of automatic controllers that 
continuously decrease pressure to 
achieve decompression in accordance 
with the tables specified by the 
standard. The applicant’s alternative 
includes using the 1992 French 
Decompression Tables for guiding 
staged decompression to achieve lower 
occurrences of DCI, using a trained and 
competent attendant for implementing 
appropriate hyperbaric entry and exit 
procedures, and providing a competent 
hyperbaric supervisor and attending 
physician certified in hyperbaric 
medicine to oversee all hyperbaric 
operations. 
In reaching this conclusion, OSHA 
again notes the experience of previous 
nearly identical tunneling variances, the 
experiences of States with OSHA- 
approved State Plans, and a review of 
the literature and other information 
noted earlier. 
C. 29 CFR 1926.803(g)(1)(xvii) 
The applicant developed, and 
proposed to implement, an effective 
alternative to the use of the special 
decompression chamber required by 29 
CFR 1926.803(g)(1)(xvii). The TBM’s 
man-lock and working chamber appear 
to satisfy all of the conditions of the 
special decompression chamber, 
including that they provide sufficient 
space for the maximum crew of three 
CAWs to stand up and move around, 
and safely accommodate decompression 
times up to 360 minutes. Therefore, 
again noting OSHA’s previous 
experience with nearly identical 
variances including the same 
alternative, OSHA preliminarily 
determined that the TBM’s man-lock 
and working chamber function as 
effectively as the special decompression 
chamber required by the standard. 
Based on a review of available 
evidence, the experience of State Plans 
that granted variances (Nevada, Oregon, 
and Washington)

11
for 
hyperbaric exposures occurring during 
similar subaqueous tunnel-construction 
work, and the information provided in 
the applicant’s variance application, 
OSHA is granting the permanent 
variance. 
Pursuant to Section 6(d) of the 
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 
1970 (29 U.S.C. 655(d)), and based on 
the record discussed above, the agency 
finds that when CBNA/Halmar complies 
with the conditions of the following 
order, the working conditions of the 
workers are at least as safe and healthful 
as if it complied with the working 
conditions specified by paragraphs 
(f)(1), (g)(1)(iii), and (g)(1)(xvii) of 29 
CFR 1926.803. Therefore, CBNA/Halmar 
must: (1) comply with the conditions 
listed below under ‘‘Conditions 
Specified for the Permanent Variance’’ 
for the period between the date of this 
notice and completion of the Potomac 
River Tunnel Project; (2) comply fully 
with all other applicable provisions of 
29 CFR part 1926; and (3) provide a 
copy of this Federal Register notice to 
all employees affected by the 
conditions, including the affected 
employees of other employers, using the 
same means it used to inform these 
employees of the application for a 
permanent variance. Additionally, this 
order will remain in effect until one of 
the following conditions occurs: (1) 
completion of the Potomac River Tunnel 
Project; or (2) OSHA modifies or revokes 
this final order in accordance with 29 
CFR 1905.13. 
VI. Description of the Specified 
Conditions for the Permanent Variance 
The conditions for the variance are set 
out in the Order at the end of this 
document. This section provides 
additional detail regarding the 
conditions in the Order. 
Condition A: Scope 
The scope of the permanent variance 
limits coverage to the work situations 
specified. Clearly defining the scope of 
the permanent variance provides CBNA/ 
Halmar, their employees, potential 
future applicants, other stakeholders, 
the public, and OSHA with necessary 
information regarding the work 
situations in which the permanent 
variance applies. To the extent that 
CBNA/Halmar exceeds the defined 
scope of this variance, it will be 
required to comply with OSHA’s 
standards. This permanent variance 
applies only to the applicant, CBNA/ 
Halmar, and only to the remainder of 
construction work on the Potomac River 
Tunnel Project. 
Condition B: List of Abbreviations 
Condition B defines abbreviations 
used in the permanent variance. OSHA 
believes that defining these 
abbreviations serves to clarify and 
standardize their usage, thereby 
enhancing the applicant’s and its 
employees’ understanding of the 
conditions specified by the permanent 
variance. 
Condition C: Definitions 
The condition defines a series of 
terms, mostly technical terms, used in 
the permanent variance to standardize 
and clarify their meaning. OSHA 
believes that defining these terms serves 
to enhance the applicant’s and its 
employees’ understanding of the 
conditions specified by the permanent 
variance. 
Condition D: Safety and Health 
Practices 
This condition requires the applicant 
to develop and submit to OSHA a HOM 
specific to the Potomac River Tunnel 
Project at least six months before using 
the TBM for tunneling operations. The 
applicant must also submit, at least six 
months before using the TBM, proof that 
the TBM’s hyperbaric chambers have 
been designed, fabricated, inspected, 
tested, marked, and stamped in 
accordance with the requirements of the 
most recent edition of ASME PVHO–1 
(Safety Standards for Pressure Vessels 
for Human Occupancy). These 
requirements ensure that the applicant 
develops hyperbaric safety and health 
procedures suitable for the project. 
The submission of the HOM enables 
OSHA to determine whether the safety 
and health instructions and measures it 
specifies are appropriate to the field 
conditions of the tunnel (including 
expected geological conditions), 
conform to the conditions of the 
variance, and adequately protect the 
safety and health of the CAWs. It also 
facilitates OSHA’s ability to ensure that 
the applicant is complying with these 
instructions and measures. The 
requirement for proof of compliance 
with ASME PVHO–1 is intended to 
ensure that the equipment is 
structurally sound and capable of 
performing to protect the safety of the 
employees exposed to hyperbaric 
pressure. The applicant has submitted 
the HOM and proof of compliance with 
the most recent edition of ASME 
PVHO–1. 
Additionally, the condition includes a 
series of related hazard prevention and 
control requirements and methods (e.g., 
decompression tables, job hazard 
analyses (JHA), operations and 
inspections checklists, incident 
investigation, and recording and 
notification to OSHA of recordable 
hyperbaric injuries and illnesses) 
designed to ensure the continued 
effective functioning of the hyperbaric 
equipment and operating system. 
Condition E: Communication 
This condition requires the applicant 
to develop and implement an effective 
system of information sharing and 
communication. Effective information 
sharing and communication are 
intended to ensure that affected workers 
receive updated information regarding 
any safety-related hazards and 
incidents, and corrective actions taken, 
prior to the start of each shift. The 
condition also requires the applicant to 
ensure that reliable means of emergency 
communications are available and 
maintained for affected workers and 
support personnel during hyperbaric 
operations. Availability of such reliable 
means of communications enables 
affected workers and support personnel 
to respond quickly and effectively to 
hazardous conditions or emergencies 
that may develop during TBM 
operations. 
Condition F: Worker Qualification and 
Training 
This condition requires the applicant 
to develop and implement an effective 
qualification and training program for 
affected workers. The condition 
specifies the factors that an affected 
worker must know to perform safely 
during hyperbaric operations, including 
how to enter, work in, and exit from 
hyperbaric conditions under both 
normal and emergency conditions. 
Having well-trained and qualified 
workers performing hyperbaric 
intervention work is intended to ensure 
that they recognize, and respond 
appropriately to, hyperbaric safety and 
health hazards. These qualification and 
training requirements enable affected 
workers to cope effectively with 
emergencies, as well as the discomfort 
and physiological effects of hyperbaric 
exposure, thereby preventing worker 
injury, illness, and fatalities. 
Paragraph (2)(e) of this condition 
requires the applicant to provide 
affected workers with information they 
can use to contact the appropriate 
healthcare professionals if the workers 
believe they are developing hyperbaric- 
related health effects. This requirement 
provides for early intervention and 
treatment of DCI and other health effects 
resulting from hyperbaric exposure,

www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/forms. 
thereby reducing the potential severity 
of these effects. 
Condition G: Inspections, Tests, and 
Accident Prevention 
Condition G requires the applicant to 
develop, implement, and operate a 
program of frequent and regular 
inspections of the TBM’s hyperbaric 
equipment and support systems, and 
associated work areas. This condition 
helps to ensure the safe operation and 
physical integrity of the equipment and 
work areas necessary to conduct 
hyperbaric operations. The condition 
also enhances worker safety by reducing 
the risk of hyperbaric-related 
emergencies. 
Paragraph (3) of this condition 
requires the applicant to document 
tests, inspections, corrective actions, 
and repairs involving the TBM, and 
maintain these documents at the jobsite 
for the duration of the job. This 
requirement provides the applicant with 
information needed to schedule tests 
and inspections to ensure the continued 
safe operation of the equipment and 
systems, and to determine that the 
actions taken to correct defects in 
hyperbaric equipment and systems were 
appropriate, prior to returning them to 
service. 
Condition H: Compression and 
Decompression 
This condition requires the applicant 
to consult with the designated medical 
advisor regarding special compression 
or decompression procedures 
appropriate for any unacclimated CAW 
and then implement the procedures 
recommended by the medical advisor. 
This proposed provision ensures that 
the applicant consults with the medical 
advisor, and involves the medical 
advisor in the evaluation, development, 
and implementation of compression or 
decompression protocols appropriate for 
any CAW requiring acclimation to the 
hyperbaric conditions encountered 
during TBM operations. Accordingly, 
CAWs requiring acclimation have an 
opportunity to acclimate prior to 
exposure to these hyperbaric conditions. 
OSHA believes this condition will 
prevent or reduce adverse reactions 
among CAWs to the effects of 
compression or decompression 
associated with the intervention work 
they perform in the TBM. 
Condition I: Recordkeeping 
Under OSHA’s recordkeeping 
requirements in 29 CFR part 1904 
regarding Recording and Reporting 
Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, the 
employer must maintain a record of any 
recordable injury, illness, or fatality (as 
defined by 29 CFR part 1904) resulting 
from exposure of an employee to 
hyperbaric conditions, or any other 
work condition, by completing the 
OSHA Form 301 Incident Report and 
OSHA Form 300 Log of Work-Related 
Injuries and Illnesses. The applicant did 
not seek a variance from this standard 
and therefore CBNA/Halmar must 
comply fully with those requirements. 
Examples of important information to 
include on the OSHA Form 301 Injury 
and Illness Incident Report (along with 
the corresponding questions on the 
form) are: 
Q14 
€the task performed; €the composition of the gas mixture (e.g., air or oxygen); €an estimate of the CAW’s workload; €the maximum working pressure; €temperature in the work and decompression environments; 
€unusual occurrences, if any, during the task or decompression 
Q15 
€time of symptom onset; €duration between decompression and onset of symptoms 
Q16 
€type and duration of symptoms; €a medical summary of the illness or injury. 
Q17 
€duration of the hyperbaric intervention; 
€possible contributing factors; €the number of prior interventions completed by the injured or ill CAW; 
and the pressure to which the CAW was 
exposed during those interventions.
12
 
Condition I adds additional reporting 
responsibilities, beyond those already 
required by the OSHA standard. The 
applicant is required to maintain 
records of specific factors associated 
with each hyperbaric intervention. The 
information gathered and recorded 
under Condition I, in concert with the 
information provided under Condition J 
(using OSHA Form 301 Injury and 
Illness Incident Report to investigate 
and record hyperbaric recordable 
injuries as defined by 29 CFR 1904.4, 
1904.7, and 1904.8–.12), enables the 
applicant and OSHA to assess the 
effectiveness of the permanent variance 
in preventing DCI and other hyperbaric- 
related effects. 
Condition J: Notifications 
Under the notifications condition, the 
applicant is required, within specified 
periods of time, to notify OSHA of: (1) 
any recordable injury, illness, in-patient 
hospitalization, amputation, loss of an 
eye, or fatality that occurs as a result of 
hyperbaric exposures during TBM 
operations; and in-patient 
hospitalization, amputation, loss of an 
eye or fatality that occurs during other 
operations must also be reported 
pursuant to 29 CFR 1910.39(a); (2) 
provide OSHA a copy of the hyperbaric 
exposures incident investigation report 
(using OSHA Form 301 Injury and 
Illness Incident Report) of these events 
within 24 hours of the incident; (3) 
include on OSHA Form 301 Injury and 
Illness Incident Report information on 
the hyperbaric conditions associated 
with the recordable injury or illness, the 
root-cause determination, and 
preventive and corrective actions 
identified and implemented; (4) provide 
the certification that affected workers 
were informed of the incident and the 
results of the incident investigation; (5) 
notify OSHA’s Office of Technical 
Programs and Coordination Activities 
(OTPCA) and the Baltimore/Washington 
OSHA Area Office within 15 working 
days should the applicant need to revise 
the HOM to accommodate changes in its 
compressed-air operations that affect 
CBNA/Halmar’s ability to comply with 
the conditions of the permanent 
variance; and (6) provide OTPCA and 
the Baltimore/Washington OSHA Area 
Office at the end of the project, with a 
report evaluating the effectiveness of the 
decompression tables. 
It should be noted that the 
requirement for completing and 
submitting the hyperbaric exposure- 
related (recordable) incident 
investigation report (OSHA 301 Injury 
and Illness Incident Report) is more 
restrictive than the current 
recordkeeping requirement of 
completing OSHA Form 301 Injury and 
Illness Incident Report within 7 
calendar days of the incident 
(1904.29(b)(3)). This modified, more 
stringent incident investigation and 
reporting requirement is restricted to 
intervention-related hyperbaric 
(recordable) incidents only. Providing 
rapid notification to OSHA is essential 
because time is a critical element in 
OSHA’s ability to determine the 
continued effectiveness of the variance 
conditions in preventing hyperbaric 
incidents, and the applicant’s 
identification and implementation of 
appropriate corrective and preventive 
actions.

See Appendix 10 of ‘‘A Guide to the Work in 
Compressed-Air Regulations 1996,’’ published by 
the United Kingdom Health and Safety Executive 
available from NIOSH at http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ 
docket/archive/pdfs/NIOSH-254/compReg1996.pdf. 
15
Also see 29 CFR 1926.1202 for examples of hot 
work. 
Further, these notification 
requirements also enable the applicant, 
its employees, and OSHA to assess the 
effectiveness of the permanent variance 
in providing the requisite level of safety 
to the applicant’s workers and based on 
this assessment, whether to revise or 
revoke the conditions of the permanent 
variance. Timely notification permits 
OSHA to take whatever action may be 
necessary and appropriate to prevent 
possible further injuries and illnesses. 
Providing notification to employees 
informs them of the precautions taken 
by the applicant to prevent similar 
incidents in the future. 
Additionally, this condition requires 
the applicant to notify OSHA if it ceases 
to do business, has a new address or 
location for the main office, or transfers 
the operations covered by the 
permanent variance to a successor 
company. In addition, the condition 
specifies that the transfer of the 
permanent variance to a successor 
company must be approved by OSHA. 
These requirements allow OSHA to 
communicate effectively with the 
applicant regarding the status of the 
permanent variance and expedite the 
agency’s administration and 
enforcement of the permanent variance. 
Stipulating that the applicant is 
required to have OSHA’s approval to 
transfer a variance to a successor 
company provides assurance that the 
successor company has knowledge of, 
and will comply with, the conditions 
specified by the permanent variance, 
thereby ensuring the safety of workers 
involved in performing the operations 
covered by the permanent variance. 
VII. Order 
As of the effective date of this final 
order, OSHA is revoking the interim 
order granted to the employer on July 
24, 2024 (90 FR 34902) and replacing it 
with a permanent variance order. Note 
that there are not any substantive 
changes in the conditions between the 
interim order and this final order. 
OSHA issues this final order 
authorizing CBNA/Halmar to comply 
with the following conditions instead of 
complying with the requirements of 29 
CFR 1926.803 (f)(1), (g)(1)(iii), and 
(g)(1)(xvii). These conditions are: 
A. Scope 
The permanent variance applies only 
when CBNA/Halmar stops the tunnel- 
boring work, pressurizes the working 
chamber, and the CAWs either enter the 
working chamber to perform an 
intervention (i.e., inspect, maintain, or repair the mechanical-excavation 
components), or exit the working 
chamber after performing interventions. 
The permanent variance applies only 
to work: 
1. That occurs in conjunction with 
construction of the Potomac River 
Tunnel Project, a tunnel constructed 
using advanced shielded mechanical- 
excavation techniques and involving 
operation of a TBM; 
2. In the TBM’s forward section (the 
working chamber) and associated 
hyperbaric chambers used to pressurize 
and decompress employees entering and 
exiting the working chamber; and 
3. Performed in compliance with all 
applicable provisions of 29 CFR part 
1926 except for the requirements 
specified by 29 CFR 1926.803 (f)(1), 
(g)(1)(iii), and (g)(1)(xvii). 
4. This order will remain in effect 
until one of the following conditions 
occurs: (1) completion of the Potomac 
River Tunnel Project; or (2) OSHA 
modifies or revokes this final order in 
accordance with 29 CFR 1905.13.

symptoms of DCI, can include: barotrauma 
(direct damage to air-containing cavities in 
the body such as ears, sinuses, and lungs); 
nitrogen narcosis (reversible alteration in 
consciousness that may occur in hyperbaric 
environments and is caused by the anesthetic 
effect of certain gases at high pressure); and 
oxygen toxicity (a central nervous system

structure. 
11. Hyperbaric Operations Manual—a detailed, project-specific health and 
safety plan developed and implemented 
by CBNA/Halmar for working in 
compressed air during the Potomac 
River Tunnel Project. 
12. Job hazard analysis—an evaluation of tasks or operations to 
identify potential hazards and to 
determine the necessary controls. 
13. Man-lock—an enclosed space capable of pressurization, and used for 
compressing or decompressing any 
employee or material when either is 
passing into, or out of, a working 
chamber. 
14. Medical Advisor—medical professional experienced in the physical 
requirements of compressed air work 
and the treatment of decompression 
illness. 
15. Pressure—a force acting on a unit area. Usually expressed as pounds per 
square inch (p.s.i.). 
16. p.s.i.—pounds per square inch, a common unit of measurement of 
pressure; a pressure given in p.s.i. 
corresponds to absolute pressure. 
17. p.s.i.a.—pounds per square inch absolute, or absolute pressure, is the 
sum of the atmospheric pressure and 
gauge pressure. At sea-level, 
atmospheric pressure is approximately 
14.7 p.s.i.a. Adding 14.7 to a pressure 
expressed in units of p.s.i.g. will yield 
the absolute pressure, expressed as 
p.s.i.a. 
18. p.s.i.g.—pounds per square inch gauge, a common unit of pressure; 
pressure expressed as p.s.i.g. 
corresponds to pressure relative to 
atmospheric pressure. At sea-level, 
atmospheric pressure is approximately 
14.7 p.s.i.a. Subtracting 14.7 from a 
pressure expressed in units of p.s.i.a. 
yields the gauge pressure, expressed as 
p.s.i.g. At sea level the gauge pressure 
is 0 p.s.i.g. 
19. Qualified person—an individual who, by possession of a recognized 
degree, certificate, or professional 
standing, or who, by extensive 
knowledge, training, and experience,

project.
16
 
20. Working chamber—an enclosed space in the TBM in which CAWs 
perform interventions, and which is 
accessible only through a man-lock. 
D. Safety and Health Practices 
1. CBNA/Halmar must implement the 
project-specific HOM submitted to 
OSHA as part of the application (see 
OSHA–2025–0002–0003). The HOM 
provides the minimum requirements 
regarding expected safety and health 
hazards (including anticipated 
geological conditions) and hyperbaric 
exposures during the tunnel- 
construction project. 
2. CBNA/Halmar must demonstrate 
that the TBM on the project is designed, 
fabricated, inspected, tested, marked, 
and stamped in accordance with the 
most recent requirements of ASME 
PVHO–1 (Safety Standards for Pressure 
Vessels for Human Occupancy) for the 
TBM’s hyperbaric chambers. 
3. CBNA/Halmar must implement the 
safety and health instructions included 
in the manufacturer’s operations 
manuals for the TBM, and the safety and 
health instructions provided by the 
manufacturer for the operation of 
decompression equipment. 
4. CBNA/Halmar must ensure that 
there are no exposures to pressures 
greater than 49.5. p.s.i.g. 
5. CBNA/Halmar must ensure that air 
or oxygen is the only breathing gas in 
the working chamber. 
6. CBNA/Halmar must follow the 
1992 French Decompression Tables for 
air or oxygen decompression as 
specified in the HOM; specifically, the 
extracted portions of the 1992 French 
Decompression tables titled, ‘‘French 
Regulation Air Standard Tables.’’ 
7. CBNA/Halmar must equip man- 
locks used by employees with an air or 
oxygen delivery system, as specified by 
the HOM for the project. CBNA/Halmar 
is prohibited from storing in the tunnel 
any oxygen or other compressed gases 
used in conjunction with hyperbaric 
work. 
8. Workers performing hot work 
under hyperbaric conditions must use 
flame-retardant personal protective 
equipment and clothing. 
9. In hyperbaric work areas, CBNA/ 
Halmar must maintain an adequate fire- 
suppression system approved for 
hyperbaric work areas. 
10. CBNA/Halmar must develop and 
implement one or more job hazard 
analysis (JHA) for work in the 
hyperbaric work areas, and review, 
periodically and as necessary (e.g., after making changes to a planned 
intervention that affects its operation), 
the contents of the JHAs with affected 
employees. The JHAs must include all 
the job functions that the risk 
assessment
17
indicates are essential to 
prevent injury or illness. 
11. CBNA/Halmar must develop a set 
of checklists to guide compressed-air 
work and ensure that employees follow 
the procedures required by the 
permanent variance (including all 
procedures required by the HOM 
approved by OSHA for the project, 
which this permanent variance 
incorporates by reference). The 
checklists must include all steps and 
equipment functions that the risk 
assessment indicates are essential to 
prevent injury or illness during 
compressed-air work. 
12. CBNA/Halmar must ensure that 
the safety and health provisions of this 
project-specific HOM adequately protect 
the workers of all contractors and 
subcontractors involved in hyperbaric 
operations for the project to which the 
HOM applies.
18
 
E. Communication 
1. Prior to beginning a shift, CBNA/ 
Halmar must implement a system that 
informs workers exposed to hyperbaric 
conditions of any hazardous 
occurrences or conditions that might 
affect their safety, including hyperbaric 
incidents, gas releases, equipment 
failures, earth or rockslides, cave-ins, 
flooding, fires, or explosions. 
2. CBNA/Halmar must provide a 
power-assisted means of 
communication among affected workers 
and support personnel in hyperbaric 
conditions where unassisted voice 
communication is inadequate. 
(a) CBNA/Halmar must use an 
independent power supply for powered 
communication systems, and these 
systems have to operate such that use or 
disruption of any one phone or signal 
location will not disrupt the operation 
of the system from any other location. 
(b) CBNA/Halmar must test 
communication systems at the start of 
each shift and as necessary thereafter to 
ensure proper operation. 
F. Worker Qualifications and Training 
CBNA/Halmar must: 
1. Ensure that each affected worker 
receives effective training on how to 
safely enter, work in, exit from, and 
undertake emergency evacuation or 
rescue from, hyperbaric conditions, and 
document this training.

hyperbaric operations, to each worker 
who performs work, or controls the 
exposure of others, and document this 
instruction. The instruction must 
include: 
(a) The physics and physiology of 
hyperbaric work; 
(b) Recognition of pressure-related 
injuries; 
(c) Information on the causes and 
recognition of the signs and symptoms 
associated with decompression illness, 
and other hyperbaric intervention- 
related health effects (e.g., barotrauma, nitrogen narcosis, and oxygen toxicity); 
(d) How to avoid discomfort during 
compression and decompression; 
(e) Information the workers can use to 
contact the appropriate healthcare 
professionals should the workers have 
concerns that they may be experiencing 
adverse health effects from hyperbaric 
exposure; and

applicable to the employee in the 
project-specific HOM. 
3. Repeat the instruction specified in 
paragraph (G) of this condition 
periodically and as necessary (e.g., after making changes to its hyperbaric 
operations). 
4. When conducting training for its 
hyperbaric workers, make this training 
available to OSHA personnel and notify 
the OTPCA at OSHA’s national office 
and OSHA’s Baltimore/Washington 
Area Office before the training takes 
place. 
G. Inspections, Tests, and Accident 
Prevention 
1. CBNA/Halmar must initiate and 
maintain a program of frequent and 
regular inspections of the TBM’s 
hyperbaric equipment and support 
systems (such as temperature control, 
illumination, ventilation, and fire- 
prevention and fire-suppression 
systems), and hyperbaric work areas, as 
required under 29 CFR 1926.20(b)(2), 
including: 
(a) Developing a set of checklists to be 
used by a competent person in 
conducting weekly inspections of 
hyperbaric equipment and work areas; 
and 
(b) Ensuring that a competent person 
conducts daily visual checks and 
weekly inspections of the TBM.

equipment that is found to constitute a 
safety hazard until CBNA/Halmar 
corrects the hazardous condition and 
has the correction approved by a 
qualified person. 
3. CBNA/Halmar must maintain 
records of all tests and inspections of 
the TBM, as well as associated 
corrective actions and repairs, at the job 
site for the duration of the tunneling 
project and for 90 days after the final 
project report is submitted to OSHA. 
H. Compression and Decompression 
CBNA/Halmar must consult with its 
attending physician concerning the 
need for special compression or 
decompression exposures appropriate 
for CAWs not acclimated to hyperbaric 
exposure. 
I. Recordkeeping 
In addition to completing OSHA Form 
301 Injury and Illness Incident Report 
and OSHA Form 300 Log of Work- 
Related Injuries and Illnesses, CBNA/ 
Halmar must maintain records of: 
1. The date, times (e.g., time compression started, time spent 
compressing, time performing 
intervention, time spent 
decompressing), and pressure for each 
hyperbaric intervention. 
2. The names of all supervisors and 
DMTs involved for each intervention. 
3. The name of each individual 
worker exposed to hyperbaric pressure 
and the decompression protocols and 
results for each worker. 
4. The total number of interventions 
and the amount of hyperbaric work time 
at each pressure. 
5. The results of the post-intervention 
physical assessment of each CAW for 
signs and symptoms of decompression 
illness, barotrauma, nitrogen narcosis, 
oxygen toxicity or other health effects

I. Overview 
On July 16, 2024, OSHA received a 
variance application submitted by letter 
from McNally Tunneling Corp./ASI 
(McNally/ASI Marine or the applicant) 
submitted under Section 6(d) of the 
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 
1970 (the Act), 29 U.S.C. 655, and 29 
CFR 1905.11 (Variances and other relief 
under Section 6(d)) an application for a 
permanent variance from several 
provisions of the OSHA standard that 
regulates work in compressed air, 
1926.803 of 1926 Subpart S— 
Underground Construction, Caissons, 
Cofferdams, and Compressed Air, and 
an interim order allowing it to proceed 
while OSHA considers the request for a 
permanent variance This notice 
addresses McNally/ASI Marine’s 
application for a permanent variance 
and interim order for construction of 
Southerly Tunnel and Consolidation 
Project in Cleveland, Ohio, only and is 
not applicable to future McNally/ASI 
Marine tunneling projects. 
Specifically, McNally/ASI Marine 
sought a variance from the provisions of 
the standard that: (1) prohibit 
compressed-air worker exposure to 
pressures exceeding 50 pounds per 
square inch (p.s.i.) except in an 
emergency (29 CFR 1926.803(e)(5));
1
(2) 
require the use of the decompression 
values specified in decompression 
tables in Appendix A of the 
compressed-air standard for 
construction (29 CFR 1926.803(f)(1)); 
and (3) require the use of automated 
operational controls and a special 
decompression chamber (29 CFR 
1926.803(g)(1)(iii) and .803(g)(1)(xvii), 
respectively). McNally/ASI Marine also 
requested an interim order pending 
OSHA’s decision on the application for 
a variance (Document ID No. OSHA– 
2025–0004–0002). 
OSHA reviewed McNally/ASI 
Marine’s application for a permanent 
variance and interim order and 
determined that it was appropriately 
submitted in compliance with the 
applicable variance procedures in 
Section 6(d) of the Occupational Safety 
and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act; 29 
U.S.C. 655) and OSHA’s regulations at 
29 CFR 1905.11 (variances and other 
relief under section 6(d)). 
OSHA reviewed the alternative 
procedures in McNally/ASI Marine’s 
application and preliminarily 
determined that the applicant’s 
proposed alternatives on the whole, 
subject to the conditions in the request 
and imposed by the interim order, 
provide measures that are as safe and 
healthful as those required by the cited 
OSHA standards. On July 24, 2025, 
OSHA published a Federal Register 
notice announcing McNally/ASI 
Marine’s application for permanent 
variance, stating the preliminary 
determination along with the basis of 
that determination, and granting the 
interim order (90 FR 34887). OSHA 
requested comments on each. 
OSHA did not receive any comments 
or other information disputing the 
preliminary determination that the 
alternatives were at least as safe as 
OSHA’s standard, nor any objections to 
OSHA granting a permanent variance. 
Accordingly, through this notice OSHA 
grants a permanent variance, subject to 
the conditions set out in this document. 
A. Background 
The information that follows about 
McNally/ASI Marine, its methods, and 
its project comes from McNally/ASI 
Marine’s variance application. 
McNally/ASI Marine is a contractor 
for the Southerly Tunnel and 
Consolidation Project (the project), that 
works on complex tunnel projects using 
innovations in tunnel-excavation 
methods. The applicant’s workers 
engage in the construction of tunnels 
using advanced shielded mechanical 
excavation techniques in conjunction 
with an earth pressure balanced micro- 
tunnel boring machine (TBM). Using 
shielded mechanical excavation 
techniques, in conjunction with precast 
concrete tunnel liners and backfill 
grout, TBMs provide methods to achieve 
the face pressures required to maintain 
a stabilized tunnel face through various 
geologies and isolate that pressure to the 
forward section (the working chamber) 
of the TBM. 
McNally/ASI Marine asserts that it 
bores tunnels using a TBM at levels 
below the water table through soft soils

See the definition of ‘‘Affected employee or 
worker’’ in section VII.C. of this Notice. 
consisting of clay, silt, and sand. TBMs 
are capable of maintaining pressure at 
the tunnel face, and stabilizing existing 
geological conditions, through the 
controlled use of a mechanically driven 
cutter head, bulkheads within the 
shield, ground-treatment foam, and a 
screw conveyor that moves excavated 
material from the working chamber. The 
forward-most portion of the TBM is the 
working chamber, and this chamber is 
the only pressurized segment of the 
TBM. Within the shield, the working 
chamber consists of two sections: the 
forward working chamber and the 
staging chamber. The forward working 
chamber is immediately behind the 
cutter head and tunnel face. The staging 
chamber is behind the forward working 
chamber and between the man-lock 
door and the entry door to the forward 
working chamber. 
The TBM has twin man-locks located 
between the pressurized working 
chamber and the non-pressurized 
portion of the machine. Each man-lock 
has two compartments. This 
configuration allows workers to access 
the man-locks for compression and 
decompression, and medical personnel 
to access the man-locks if required in an 
emergency. 
McNally/ASI Marine’s Hyberbaric 
Operations Manual (HOM) for the 
Southerly Tunnel and Consolidation 
Project indicates that the maximum 
pressure to which it is likely to expose 
workers during project interventions for 
the Southerly Tunnel and Consolidation 
Project is 58 p.s.i. Therefore, to work 
effectively, McNally/ASI Marine must 
perform hyperbaric interventions in 
compressed air at pressures nearly 20% 
higher than the maximum pressure 
specified by the existing OSHA 
standard, 29 CFR 1926.803(e)(5), which 
states: ‘‘No employee shall be subjected 
to pressure exceeding 50 p.s.i. except in 
emergency’’ (see footnote 1). 
McNally/ASI Marine employs 
specially trained personnel for the 
construction of the tunnel. To keep the 
machinery working effectively, 
McNally/ASI Marine asserts that these 
workers must periodically enter the 
excavation working chamber of the TBM 
to perform hyperbaric interventions 
during which workers would be 
exposed to air pressures up to 58 p.s.i., 
which exceeds the maximum pressure 
specified by the existing OSHA standard 
at 29 CFR 1926.803(e)(5). These 
interventions consist of conducting 
inspections or maintenance work on the 
cutter-head structure and cutting tools 
of the TBM, such as changing 
replaceable cutting tools and disposable 
wear bars, and, in rare cases, repairing 
structural damage to the cutter head. 
These interventions are the only time 
that workers are exposed to compressed 
air. Interventions in the working 
chamber (the pressurized portion of the 
TBM) take place only after halting 
tunnel excavation and preparing the 
machine and crew for an intervention. 
During interventions, workers enter 
the working chamber through one of the 
twin man-locks that open into the 
staging chamber. To reach the forward 
part of the working chamber, workers 
pass through a door in a bulkhead that 
separates the staging chamber from the 
forward working chamber. The man- 
locks and the working chamber are 
designed to accommodate three people, 
which is the maximum crew size 
allowed under the permanent variance. 
When the required decompression times 
are greater than work times, the twin 
man-locks allow for crew rotation. 
During crew rotation, one crew can be 
compressing or decompressing while 
the second crew is working. Therefore, 
the working crew always has an 
unoccupied man-lock at its disposal. 
McNally/ASI Marine asserts that these 
innovations in tunnel excavation have 
greatly reduced worker exposure to 
hazards of pressurized air work because 
they have eliminated the need to 
pressurize the entire tunnel for the 
project and would thereby reduce the 
number of workers exposed, as well as 
the total duration of exposure, to 
hyperbaric pressure during tunnel 
construction. These advances in 
technology substantially modified the 
methods used by the construction 
industry to excavate subaqueous tunnels 
compared to the caisson work regulated 
by the current OSHA compressed-air 
standard for construction at 29 CFR 
1926.803. 
In addition to the reduced exposures 
resulting from the innovations in 
tunnel-excavation methods, McNally/ 
ASI Marine asserts that innovations in 
hyperbaric medicine and technology 
improve the safety of decompression 
from hyperbaric exposures. These 
procedures, however, would deviate 
from the decompression process that 
OSHA requires for construction in 29 
CFR 1926.803(e)(5) and (f)(1) and the 
decompression tables in Appendix A of 
29 CFR 1926, subpart S. Nevertheless, 
according to McNally/ASI Marine, their 
use of decompression protocols 
incorporating oxygen is more efficient, 
effective, and safer for tunnel workers 
than compliance with the 
decompression tables specified by the 
existing OSHA standard. 
McNally/ASI Marine contends that 
the alternative safety measures included 
in the application provide McNally/ASI 
Maine’s workers with a place of 
employment that is at least as safe under 
its proposed alternatives as they would 
be under OSHA’s compressed-air 
standard for construction. McNally/ASI 
Marine also provided OSHA a project- 
specific HOM, (OSHA–2025–0004– 
0003) that requires specialized medical 
support and hyperbaric supervision to 
provide assistance to a team of specially 
trained man-lock attendants and 
hyperbaric or compressed-air workers to 
support their assertions of equivalency 
in worker protection. 
OSHA included all of the above 
information in the Federal Register 
notice regarding McNally/ASI Marine’s 
variance application and did not receive 
any comments disputing any of that 
information, including the safety 
assertions made by McNally/ASI Marine 
in the variance application. 
II. The Variance Application 
Pursuant to the requirements of 
OSHA’s variance regulations (29 CFR 
1905.11), the applicant has certified that 
it notified its workers
2
of the variance 
application and request for interim 
order by posting, at prominent locations 
where it normally posts workplace 
notices, a summary of the application 
and information specifying where the 
workers can examine a copy of the 
application. In addition, the applicant 
has certified that it informed its workers 
of their right to petition the Assistant 
Secretary of Labor for Occupational 
Safety and Health for a hearing on the 
variance modification application. 
III. OSHA History of Approval of 
Nearly Identical Variance Requests 
OSHA has previously approved 
several nearly identical variances 
involving the same types of tunneling 
equipment used for similar projects 
(tunnel construction variances). OSHA 
notes that it granted several subaqueous 
tunnel construction permanent 
variances from the same provisions of 
OSHA’s compressed-air standard (29 
CFR 1926.803(e)(5), (f)(1), (g)(1)(iii), and 
(g)(1)(xvii)) that are the subject of the 
present application: (1) Impregilo,

In 1992, the French Ministry of Labour replaced 
the 1974 French Decompression Tables with the 
1992 French Decompression Tables, which differ 
from OSHA’s decompression tables in Appendix A 
by using: (1) staged decompression as opposed to 
continuous (linear) decompression; (2) 
decompression tables based on air or both air and 
pure oxygen; and (3) emergency tables when 
unexpected exposure times occur (up to 30 minutes 
above the maximum allowed working time).

orders to Ballard Marine Construction 
for the Suffolk County, New York 
Outfall Tunnel Project (86 FR 5253, 
January 19, 2021) and CBNA/Halmar 
Joint Venture (90 FR 34902, July 24, 
2025) in addition to the interim order 
granted for this project. The proposed 
alternate conditions in this notice are 
nearly identical to the alternate 
conditions of the previous permanent 
variances. OSHA is not aware of any 
injuries or other safety issues that arose 
from work performed under these 
conditions in accordance with the 
previous variances. 
IV. Applicable OSHA Standard and the 
Relevant Variance 
A. Variance From Paragraph (e)(5) of 29 
CFR 1926.803, Prohibition of Exposure 
to Pressure Greater Than 50 p.s.i.g. (see 
footnote 1) 
The applicant states that it may 
perform hyperbaric interventions at 
pressures up to 58 p.s.i.g. in the working 
chamber of the TBM; this pressure 
exceeds the pressure limit of 50 p.s.i. 
specified for nonemergency purposes by 
29 CFR 1926.803(e)(5). The TBM has 
twin man-locks, with each man-lock 
having two compartments. This 
configuration allows workers to access 
the man-locks for compression and 
decompression, and medical personnel 
to access the man-locks if required in an 
emergency. 
TBMs are capable of maintaining 
pressure at the tunnel face, and 
stabilizing existing geological 
conditions, through the controlled use 
of a mechanically driven cutter head, 
bulkheads within the shield, ground- 
treatment foam, and a screw conveyor 
that moves excavated material from the 
working chamber. As noted earlier, the 
forward-most portion of the TBM is the 
working chamber, and this chamber is 
the only pressurized segment of the 
TBM. Within the shield, the working 
chamber consists of two sections: the 
staging chamber and the forward 
working chamber. The staging chamber 
is the section of the working chamber 
between the man-lock door and the 
entry door to the forward working 
chamber. The forward working chamber 
is immediately behind the cutter head 
and tunnel face. 
McNally/ASI Marine will pressurize 
the working chamber to the level 
required to maintain a stable tunnel 
face. Pressure in the staging chamber 
ranges from atmospheric (no increased 
pressure) to a maximum pressure equal 
to the pressure in the working chamber. 
The applicant asserts that they may 
have to perform interventions at 
pressures up to 58 p.s.i. 
During interventions, workers enter 
the working chamber through one of the 
twin man-locks that open into the 
staging chamber. To reach the forward 
part of the working chamber, workers 
pass through a door in a bulkhead that 
separates the staging chamber from the 
forward working chamber. The 
maximum crew size allowed in the 
forward working chamber is three. At 
certain hyperbaric pressures (i.e., when decompression times are greater than 
work times), the twin man-locks allow 
for crew rotation. During crew rotation, 
one crew can be compressing or 
decompressing while the second crew is 
working. Therefore, the working crew 
always has an unoccupied man-lock at 
its disposal. 
Further, McNally/ASI Marine has 
developed a project-specific HOM 
(OSHA–2025–0004–0003) that describes 
in detail the hyperbaric procedures, the 
required medical examination used 
during the tunnel-construction project, 
the standard operating procedures and 
the emergency and contingency 
procedures. The procedures include 
using experienced and knowledgeable 
man-lock attendants who have the 
training and experience necessary to 
recognize and treat decompression 
illnesses and injuries. The attendants 
are under the direct supervision of the 
hyperbaric supervisor (a competent 
person experienced and trained in 
hyperbaric operations, procedures and 
safety) and attending physician. In 
addition, procedures include medical 
screening and review of prospective 
compressed-air workers (CAWs). The 
purpose of this screening procedure is 
to vet prospective CAWs with medical 
conditions (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, poor vascular circulation, and muscle 
cramping) that could be aggravated by 
sitting in a cramped space (e.g., a man- lock) for extended periods, or by 
exposure to elevated pressures and 
compressed gas mixtures. A 
transportable recompression chamber 
(shuttle) is available to extract workers 
from the hyperbaric working chamber 
for emergency evacuation and medical 
treatment; the shuttle attaches to the 
topside medical lock, which is a large 
recompression chamber. The applicant 
believes that the procedures included in 
the HOM provide safe work conditions 
when interventions are necessary, 
including interventions above 50 p.s.i. 
or 50 p.s.i.g. 
OSHA comprehensively reviewed the 
project-specific HOM and determined 
that the safety and health instructions 
and measures it specifies are 
appropriate, conform with the 
conditions in the variance, and 
adequately protect the safety and health 
of the CAWs. 
B. Variance From Paragraph (f)(1) of 29 
CFR 1926.803, Requirement To Use 
OSHA Decompression Tables 
OSHA’s compressed-air standard for 
construction requires decompression in 
accordance with the decompression 
tables in Appendix A of 29 CFR 1926, 
subpart S (29 CFR 1926.803(f)(1)). As an 
alternative to the OSHA decompression 
tables, the applicant proposes to use 
newer decompression schedules (the 
1992 French Decompression Tables) 
that rely on staged decompression and 
supplement breathing air used during 
decompression with air or oxygen (as 
appropriate).
3
The applicant asserts 
decompression protocols using the 1992 
French Decompression Tables for air or 
oxygen as specified by the Southerly 
Tunnel and Consolidation Project- 
specific Hyperbaric Operations Manual 
(HOM) are safer for tunnel workers than 
the decompression protocols specified 
in Appendix A of 29 CFR 1926, subpart 
S. Accordingly, the applicant commits 
to following the decompression 
procedures described in that HOM, 
which would require it to follow the 
1992 French Decompression Tables to 
decompress CAWs after they exit the 
hyperbaric conditions in the working 
chamber. 
Depending on the maximum working 
pressure and exposure times, the 1992 
French Decompression Tables provide 
for air decompression with or without 
oxygen. McNally/ASI Marine asserts 
that oxygen decompression has many

See, e.g., Dr. Eric Kindwall, EP (1997), Compressed air tunneling and caisson work 
decompression procedures: development, problems, 
and solutions. Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine, 
24(4), pp. 337–345. This article reported 60 treated 
cases of DCI among 4,168 exposures between 19 
and 31 p.s.i.g. over a 51-week contract period, for 
a DCI incidence of 1.44% for the decompression 
tables specified by the OSHA standard. Dr. 
Kindwall notes that the use of automatically 
regulated continuous decompression for 
compressed-air work was in some cases at the 
insistence of contractors and the union, and against 
the advice of the expert who calculated the 
decompression table and recommended using 
staged decompression. Dr. Kindwall then states, 
‘‘Continuous decompression is inefficient and 
wasteful. For example, if the last stage from 4 
p.s.i.g.... to the surface took 1h, at least half the 
time is spent at pressures less than 2 p.s.i.g.... 
, which provides less and less meaningful bubble 
suppression. . . .’’ In addition, Dr. Kindwall 
addresses the continuous-decompression protocol 
in the OSHA compressed-air standard for 
construction, noting that ‘‘[a]side from the tables for 
saturation diving to deep depths, no other widely 
used or officially approved diving decompression 
tables use straight line, continuous decompressions 
at varying rates. Stage decompression is usually the 
rule, since it is simpler to control.’’ 
benefits, including (1) keeping the 
partial pressure of nitrogen in the lungs 
as low as possible; (2) keeping external 
pressure as low as possible to reduce the 
formation of bubbles in the blood; (3) 
removing nitrogen from the lungs and 
arterial blood and increasing the rate of 
nitrogen elimination; (4) improving the 
quality of breathing during 
decompression stops so that workers are 
less tired and to prevent bone necrosis; 
(5) reducing decompression time by 
about 33 percent as compared to air 
decompression; and (6) reducing 
inflammation. 
In addition, the project-specific HOM 
requires a physician, certified in 
hyperbaric medicine, to manage the 
medical condition of CAWs during 
hyperbaric exposures and 
decompression. A trained and 
experienced man-lock attendant also 
will be present during hyperbaric 
exposures and decompression. This 
man-lock attendant will operate the 
hyperbaric system to ensure compliance 
with the specified decompression table. 
A hyperbaric supervisor, trained in 
hyperbaric operations, procedures, and 
safety, directly oversees all hyperbaric 
interventions, and ensures that staff 
follow the procedures delineated in the 
HOM or by the attending physician. 
C. Variance From Paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of 
29 CFR 1926.803, Automatically 
Regulated Continuous Decompression 
McNally/ASI Marine seeks a 
permanent variance from the OSHA 
standard at 29 CFR 1926.803(g)(1)(iii), 
which requires automatic controls to 
regulate decompression. As noted 
above, the applicant is committed to 
conducting the staged decompression 
according to the 1992 French 
Decompression Tables under the direct 
control of the trained man-lock 
attendant and under the oversight of the 
hyperbaric supervisor. 
Breathing air under hyperbaric 
conditions increases the amount of 
nitrogen gas dissolves in a CAW’s 
tissues. The greater the hyperbaric 
pressure under these conditions and the 
more time spent under the increased 
pressure, the greater the amount of 
nitrogen gas dissolved in the tissues. 
When the pressure decreases during 
decompression, tissues release the 
dissolved nitrogen gas into the blood 
system, which then carries the nitrogen 
gas to the lungs for elimination through 
exhalation. Releasing hyperbaric 
pressure too rapidly during 
decompression can increase the size of 
the bubbles formed by nitrogen gas in 
the blood system, resulting in 
decompression illness (DCI), commonly 
referred to as ‘‘the bends.’’ This 
description of the etiology of DCI is 
consistent with current scientific theory 
and research on the issue (see footnote 
16 in this notice discussing a 1985 
NIOSH report on DCI). 
The 1992 French Decompression 
Tables proposed for use by the applicant 
provide for stops during worker 
decompression (i.e., staged decompression) to control the release of 
nitrogen gas from tissues into the blood 
system. Studies show that staged 
decompression, in combination with 
other features of the 1992 French 
Decompression Tables such as the use 
of oxygen, result in a lower incidence of 
DCI than the use of automatically 
regulated continuous decompression.
4
 
In addition, the applicant asserts that 
staged decompression administered in 
accordance with its HOM is at least as 
effective as an automatic controller in 
regulating the decompression process 
because the HOM includes a hyperbaric 
supervisor who directly supervises all 
hyperbaric interventions and ensures 
that the man-lock attendant, who is a 
competent person in the manual control 
of hyperbaric systems, follows the 
schedule specified in the 
decompression tables, including stops. 
D. Variance From Paragraph (g)(1)(xvii) 
of 29 CFR 1926.803, Requirement of 
Special Decompression Chamber 
The OSHA compressed-air standard 
for construction requires employers to 
use a special decompression chamber of 
sufficient size to accommodate all 
CAWs being decompressed at the end of 
the shift when total decompression time 
exceeds 75 minutes (see 29 CFR 
1926.803(g)(1)(xvii)). Use of the special 
decompression chamber enables CAWs 
to move about and flex their joints to 
prevent neuromuscular problems during 
decompression. 
Space limitations in the TBM do not 
allow for the installation and use of an 
additional special decompression lock 
or chamber. The applicant proposes that 
it be permitted to rely on the man-locks 
and staging chamber in lieu of adding a 
separate, special decompression 
chamber. Because only a few workers 
out of the entire crew are exposed to 
hyperbaric pressure, the man-locks 
(which, as noted earlier, connect 
directly to the working chamber) and 
the staging chamber are of sufficient size 
to accommodate all exposed workers 
during decompression. The applicant 
uses the existing man-locks, each of 
which adequately accommodates a 
three-member crew for this purpose 
when decompression lasts up to 75 
minutes. When decompression exceeds 
75 minutes, crews can open the door 
connecting the two compartments in 
each man-lock (during decompression 
stops) or exit the man-lock and move 
into the staging chamber where 
additional space is available. The 
applicant asserts that this alternative 
arrangement is as effective as a special 
decompression chamber in that it has 
sufficient space for all the CAWs at the 
end of a shift and enables the CAWs to 
move about and flex their joints to 
prevent neuromuscular problems. 
V. Decision 
After reviewing the proposed 
alternatives, OSHA has determined that 
the applicant’s proposed alternatives on 
the whole, subject to the conditions in 
the variance request and imposed by 
this permanent variance, provide 
measures that are as safe and healthful 
as those required by the cited OSHA 
standards addressed in section IV of this 
notice. 
In addition, OSHA has determined 
that each of the following alternatives 
are at least as effective as the specified 
OSHA requirements: 
A. 29 CFR 1926.803(e)(5) 
McNally/ASI Marine has developed, 
and proposed to implement, effective 
alternative measures to the prohibition 
of using compressed air under 
hyperbaric conditions exceeding 50 
p.s.i. The alternative measures include 
use of engineering and administrative 
controls of the hazards associated with 
work performed in compressed-air 
conditions exceeding 50 p.s.i. while 
engaged in the construction of a 
subaqueous tunnel using advance 
shielded mechanical-excavation 
techniques in conjunction with the 
TBM. Prior to conducting interventions

at least as effective in providing safe and healthful 
employment and places of employment as the 
Federal standards (29 U.S.C. 667).

in the TBM’s pressurized working 
chamber, McNally/ASI Marine halts 
tunnel excavation and prepares the 
machine and crew to conduct the 
interventions. Interventions involve 
inspection, maintenance, or repair of the 
mechanical-excavation components 
located in the working chamber. 
B. 29 CFR 1926.803(f)(1) 
The applicant has proposed to 
implement equally effective alternative 
measures to the requirement in 29 CFR 
1926.803(f)(1) for compliance with 
OSHA’s decompression tables. The 
HOM specifies the procedures and 
personnel qualifications for performing 
work safely during the compression and 
decompression phases of interventions. 
The HOM also specifies the 
decompression tables the applicant 
proposes to use (the 1992 French 
Decompression Tables). Depending on 
the maximum working pressure and 
exposure times during the interventions, 
the tables provide for decompression 
using air, pure oxygen, or a combination 
of air and oxygen. The decompression 
tables also include delays or stops for 
various time intervals at different 
pressure levels during the transition to 
atmospheric pressure (i.e., staged decompression). In all cases, a 
physician certified in hyperbaric 
medicine will manage the medical 
condition of CAWs during 
decompression. In addition, a trained 
and experienced man-lock attendant, 
experienced in recognizing 
decompression sickness or illnesses and 
injuries, will be present. Of key 
importance, a hyperbaric supervisor, 
trained in hyperbaric operations, 
procedures, and safety, will directly 
supervise all hyperbaric operations to 
ensure compliance with the procedures 
delineated in the project-specific HOM 
or by the attending physician. 
Prior to granting the previous 
permanent variances to IHP JV, Traylor 
JV, Tully JV, Salini-Impregilo Joint 
Venture, McNally/Kiewit, Traylor-Shea, 
Traylor-Sundt and Ballard, OSHA 
conducted a review of the scientific 
literature and concluded that the 
alternative decompression method (i.e., 
the 1992 French Decompression Tables) 
McNally/ASI Marine proposed would 
be at least as safe as the decompression 
tables specified by OSHA when applied 
by trained medical personnel under the 
conditions outlined in this variance 
application. 
Some of the literature indicates that 
the alternative decompression method 
may be safer, concluding that 
decompression performed in accordance 
with these tables resulted in a lower 
occurrence of DCI than decompression 
conducted in accordance with the 
decompression tables specified by the 
standard. For example, H. L. Andersen 
studied the occurrence of DCI at 
maximum hyperbaric pressures ranging 
from 4 p.s.i.g. to 43 p.s.i.g. during 
construction of the Great Belt Tunnel in 
Denmark (1992–1996).
5
This project 
used the 1992 French Decompression 
Tables to decompress the workers 
during part of the construction. 
Andersen observed 6 DCI cases out of 
7,220 decompression events and 
reported that switching to the 1992 
French Decompression tables reduced 
the DCI incidence to 0.08% compared to 
a previous incidence rate of 0.14%. The 
DCI incidence in the study by H. L. 
Andersen is substantially less than the 
DCI incidence reported for the 
decompression tables specified in 
Appendix A. 
OSHA found no studies in which the 
DCI incidence reported for the 1992 
French Decompression Tables were 
higher than the DCI incidence reported 
for the OSHA decompression tables.
6
 
OSHA’s experience with the previous 
variances, which all incorporated nearly 
identical decompression plans and did 
not result in safety issues, also provides 
evidence that the alternative procedure 
as a whole is at least as effective for this 
type of tunneling project as compliance 
with OSHA’s decompression tables. The 
experience of State Plans
7
that either 
granted variances (Nevada, Oregon and 
Washington)
8
or promulgated a new 
standard (California)
9
for hyperbaric 
exposures occurring during similar 
subaqueous tunnel-construction work, 
provide additional evidence of the 
effectiveness of this alternative 
procedure. 
C. 29 CFR 1926.803(g)(1)(iii) 
The applicant developed, and 
proposed to implement, an equally 
effective alternative to 29 CFR 
1926.803(g)(1)(iii), which requires the 
use of automatic controllers that 
continuously decrease pressure to 
achieve decompression in accordance 
with the tables specified by the 
standard. The applicant’s alternative 
includes using the 1992 French 
Decompression Tables for guiding 
staged decompression to achieve lower 
occurrences of DCI, using a trained and 
competent attendant for implementing 
appropriate hyperbaric entry and exit 
procedures, and providing a competent 
hyperbaric supervisor and attending 
physician certified in hyperbaric 
medicine to oversee all hyperbaric 
operations. 
In reaching this preliminary 
conclusion, OSHA again notes the 
experience of previous nearly identical 
tunneling variances, the experiences of 
State Plan States, and a review of the 
literature and other information noted 
earlier. 
D. 29 CFR 1926.803(g)(1)(xvii) 
The applicant developed, and 
proposed to implement, an effective 
alternative to the use of the special 
decompression chamber required by 29 
CFR 1926.803(g)(1)(xvii). The TBM’s 
man-lock and working chamber appear 
to satisfy all of the conditions of the 
special decompression chamber, 
including that they provide sufficient 
space for the maximum crew of three 
CAWs to stand up and move around, 
and safely accommodate decompression 
times exceeding 75 minutes. Therefore, 
again noting OSHA’s previous 
experience with nearly identical 
variances including the same 
alternative, OSHA preliminarily 
determined that the TBM’s man-lock 
and working chamber function as 
effectively as the special decompression 
chamber required by the standard. 
Based on a review of available 
evidence, the experience of State Plans 
that either granted variances (Nevada, 
Oregon, and Washington)
10
or 
promulgated a new standard 
(California)

for hyperbaric exposures 
occurring during similar subaqueous 
tunnel-construction work, and the

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60757 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices variance application, OSHA is granting 
the permanent variance. 
Pursuant to Section 6(d) of the 
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 
1970 (29 U.S.C. 655), and based on the 
record discussed above, the agency 
finds that when the McNally/ASI 
Marine complies with the conditions of 
the following order, the working 
conditions of the McNally/ASI Marine’s 
workers are at least as safe and healthful 
as if it complied with the working 
conditions specified by paragraphs 
(e)(5), (f)(1), (g)(1)(iii), and (g)(1)(xvii) of 
29 CFR 1926.803. Therefore, McNally/ 
ASI Marine must: (1) comply with the 
conditions listed below under 
‘‘Conditions Specified for the 
Permanent Variance’’ for the period 
between the date of this notice and 
completion of the Southerly Tunnel and 
Consolidation Project; (2) comply fully 
with all other applicable provisions of 
29 CFR part 1926; and (3) provide a 
copy of this Federal Register notice to 
all employees affected by the 
conditions, including the affected 
employees of other employers, using the 
same means it used to inform these 
employees of the application for a 
permanent variance. Additionally, this 
order will remain in effect until one of 
the following conditions occurs: (1) 
completion of the Southerly Tunnel and 
Consolidation Project; or (2) OSHA 
modifies or revokes this final order in 
accordance with 29 CFR 1905.13. 
VI. Description of the Conditions 
Specified for the Permanent Variance 
The conditions for the variance are set 
out in the Order at the end of this 
document. This section provides 
additional detail regarding the 
conditions in the Order. 
Condition A: Scope 
The scope of the permanent variance 
limits coverage to the work situations 
specified under this condition. Clearly 
defining the scope of the permanent 
variance provides McNally/ASI Marine, 
their employees, potential future 
applicants, other stakeholders, the 
public and OSHA with necessary 
information regarding the work 
situations in which the permanent 
variance applies. To the extent that 
McNally/ASI Marine exceeds the 
defined scope of this variance, it will be 
required to comply with OSHA’s 
standards. This permanent variance 
applies only to McNally/ASI Marine, 
and only to the remainder of 
construction work on the Southerly 
Tunnel and Consolidation Project. 
Condition B: List of Abbreviations 
Condition B defines a number of 
abbreviations used in the permanent 
variance. OSHA believes that defining 
these abbreviations serves to clarify and 
standardize their usage, thereby 
enhancing the applicant’s and their 
employees’ understanding of the 
conditions specified by the permanent 
variance. 
Condition C: Definitions 
Condition C defines a series of terms, 
mostly technical terms, used in the 
permanent variance to standardize and 
clarify their meaning. Defining these 
terms serves to enhance the applicant’s 
and their employees’ understanding of 
the conditions specified by the 
permanent variance. 
Condition D: Safety and Health 
Practices 
This condition requires the applicant 
to develop and submit to OSHA an 
HOM specific to the Southerly Tunnel 
and Consolidation Project at least six 
months before using the TBM for 
tunneling operations. The applicant 
must also submit, at least six months 
before using the TBM, proof that the 
TBM’s hyperbaric chambers have been 
designed, fabricated, inspected, tested 
marked, and stamped in accordance 
with the requirements of the most recent 
edition of ASME PVHO–1–Safety 
Standards for Pressure Vessels for 
Human Occupancy). These 
requirements ensure that the applicant 
develops hyperbaric safety and health 
procedures suitable for the project. 
The submission of the HOM to OSHA 
enables OSHA to determine that the 
specific safety and health instructions 
and measures it specifies are 
appropriate to the field conditions of the 
tunnel (including expected geological 
conditions), conform to the conditions 
of the variance, and adequately protect 
the safety and health of the CAWs. It 
also facilitates OSHA’s ability to ensure 
that the applicant is complying with 
these instructions and measures. The 
requirement for proof of compliance 
with ASME PVHO–1 is intended to 
ensure that the equipment is 
structurally sound and capable of 
performing to protect the safety of the 
employees exposed to hyperbaric 
pressure. The applicant has submitted 
the HOM and proof of compliance with 
the most recent edition of ASME 
PVHO–1. 
Additionally, the condition includes a 
series of related hazard prevention and 
control requirements and methods (e.g., 
decompression tables, job hazard 
analysis (JHA), operations and 
inspections checklists, incident 
investigation, and recording and 
notification to OSHA of recordable 
hyperbaric injuries and illnesses) 
designed to ensure the continued 
effective functioning of the hyperbaric 
equipment and operating system. 
Condition E: Communication 
Condition E requires the applicant to 
develop and implement an effective 
system of information sharing and 
communication. Effective information 
sharing and communication ensures 
that affected workers receive updated 
information regarding any safety-related 
hazards and incidents, and corrective 
actions taken, prior to the start of each 
shift. The condition also requires 
McNally/ASI Marine to ensure that 
reliable means of emergency 
communications are available and 
maintained for affected workers and 
support personnel during hyperbaric 
operations. Availability of such reliable 
means of communications enables 
affected workers and support personnel 
to respond quickly and effectively to 
hazardous conditions or emergencies 
that may develop during TBM 
operations. 
Condition F: Worker Qualification and 
Training 
This condition requires the applicant 
to develop and implement an effective 
qualification and training program for 
affected workers. The condition 
specifies the factors that an affected 
worker must know to perform safely 
during hyperbaric operations, including 
how to enter, work in, and exit from 
hyperbaric conditions under both 
normal and emergency conditions. 
Having well-trained and qualified 
workers performing hyperbaric 
intervention work ensures that they 
recognize, and respond appropriately to, 
hyperbaric safety and health hazards. 
These qualification and training 
requirements enable affected workers to 
cope effectively with emergencies, as 
well as the discomfort and physiological 
effects of hyperbaric exposure, thereby 
preventing worker injury, illness, and 
fatalities. 
Paragraph (2)(e) of this condition also 
requires the applicant to provide 
affected workers with information they 
can use to contact the appropriate 
healthcare professionals if they believe 
they are developing hyperbaric-related 
health effects. This requirement 
provides for early intervention and 
treatment of DCI and other health effects 
resulting from hyperbaric exposure, 
thereby reducing the potential severity 
of these effects.

Condition G: Inspections, Tests, and 
Accident Prevention 
Condition G requires the applicant to 
develop, implement, and operate a 
program of frequent and regular 
inspections of the TBM’s hyperbaric 
equipment and support systems, and 
associated work areas. This condition 
helps to ensure the safe operation and 
physical integrity of the equipment and 
work areas necessary to conduct 
hyperbaric operations. The condition 
also enhances worker safety by reducing 
the risk of hyperbaric-related 
emergencies. 
Paragraph (3) of this condition 
requires the applicant to document 
tests, inspections, corrective actions, 
and repairs involving the TBM, and 
maintain these documents at the job site 
for the duration of the job. This 
requirement provides the applicant with 
information needed to schedule tests 
and inspections to ensure the continued 
safe operation of the equipment and 
systems, and to determine that the 
actions taken to correct defects in 
hyperbaric equipment and systems were 
appropriate, prior to returning them to 
service. 
Condition H: Compression and 
Decompression 
This condition requires the applicant 
to consult with a designated medical 
advisor regarding special compression 
or decompression procedures 
appropriate for any unacclimated CAW 
and then implement the procedures 
recommended by the medical advisor. 
This provision ensures that the 
applicant consults with the medical 
advisor, and involves the medical 
advisor in the evaluation, development, 
and implementation of compression or 
decompression protocols appropriate for 
any CAW requiring acclimation to the 
hyperbaric conditions encountered 
during TBM operations. Accordingly, 
CAWs requiring acclimation have an 
opportunity to acclimate prior to 
exposure to these hyperbaric conditions. 
OSHA believes this condition will 
prevent or reduce adverse reactions 
among CAWs to the effects of 
compression or decompression 
associated with the intervention work 
they perform in the TBM. 
Condition I: Recordkeeping 
Under OSHA’s existing recordkeeping 
requirements in 29 CFR part 1904 
regarding Recording and Reporting 
Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, the 
employer must maintain a record of any 
recordable injury, illness, or fatality (as 
defined by 29 CFR part 1904) resulting 
from exposure of an employee to 
hyperbaric conditions by completing the 
OSHA Form 301 Incident Report and 
OSHA Form 300 Log of Work-Related 
Injuries and Illnesses. The applicant did 
not seek a variance from this standard 
and therefore McNally/ASI Marine must 
comply fully with those requirements. 
Examples of important information to 
include on the OSHA Form 301 Injury 
and Illness Incident Report (along with 
the corresponding question on the form) 
are: 
Q14 
€the task performed; €the composition of the gas mixture (e.g., air or oxygen); €an estimate of the CAW’s workload; €the maximum working pressure; €temperature in the work and decompression environments; 
€unusual occurrences, if any, during the task or decompression 
Q15 
€time of symptom onset; €duration between decompression and onset of symptoms 
Q16 
€type and duration of symptoms; €a medical summary of the illness or injury 
Q17 
€duration of the hyperbaric intervention; 
€possible contributing factors; €the number of prior interventions completed by the injured or ill CAW; 
and the pressure to which the CAW was 
exposed during those interventions.
12
 
Condition I adds additional reporting 
responsibilities, beyond those already 
required by the OSHA rule. McNally/ 
ASI Marine is required to maintain 
records of specific factors associated 
with each hyperbaric intervention. The 
information gathered and recorded 
under this provision, in concert with the 
information provided under Condition J 
(using OSHA’s Form 301 Injury and 
Illness Incident Report to investigate 
and record hyperbaric recordable 
injuries as defined by 29 CFR 1904.4, 
1904.7, and 1904.8–.12), enables 
McNally/ASI Marine and OSHA to 
assess the effectiveness of the 
permanent variance in preventing DCI 
and other hyperbaric-related effects. 
Condition J: Notifications 
Under the notification condition, the 
applicant is required, within specified 
periods of time, to notify OSHA of: (1) 
any recordable injury, illness, in-patient 
hospitalization, amputation, loss of an 
eye, or fatality that occurs as a result of 
hyperbaric exposures during TBM 
operations; (2) provide OSHA a copy of 
the hyperbaric exposures incident 
investigation report (using OSHA Form 
301 Injury and Illness Incident Report) 
of these events within 24 hours of the 
incident; (3) include on OSHA Form 
301 Injury and Illness Incident Report 
information on the hyperbaric 
conditions associated with the 
recordable injury or illness, the root- 
cause determination, and preventive 
and corrective actions identified and 
implemented; (4) provide the 
certification that affected workers were 
informed of the incident and the results 
of the incident investigation; (5) notify 
OSHA’s Office of Technical Programs 
and Coordination Activities (OTPCA) 
and the Cleveland Ohio OSHA Area 
Office within 15 working days should 
the applicant need to revise the HOM to 
accommodate changes in its 
compressed-air operations that affect 
McNally/ASI Marine’s ability to comply 
with the conditions of the modified 
permanent variance; and (6) provide 
OTPCA and the Cleveland Ohio OSHA 
Area Office, at the end of the project, 
with a report evaluating the 
effectiveness of the decompression 
tables. 
It should be noted that the 
requirement for completing and 
submitting the hyperbaric exposure- 
related (recordable) incident 
investigation report (OSHA 301 Injury 
and Illness Incident Report) is more 
restrictive than the current 
recordkeeping requirement of 
completing OSHA Form 301 Injury and 
Illness Incident Report within 7 
calendar days of the incident 
(1904.29(b)(3)). This modified, more 
stringent incident investigation and 
reporting requirement is restricted to 
intervention-related hyperbaric 
(recordable) incidents only. Providing 
rapid notification to OSHA is essential 
because time is a critical element in 
OSHA’s ability to determine the 
continued effectiveness of the variance 
conditions in preventing hyperbaric 
incidents, and the applicant’s 
identification and implementation of 
appropriate corrective and preventive 
actions. 
Further, these notification 
requirements also enable the applicant, 
their employees, and OSHA to assess 
the effectiveness of the modified 
permanent variance in providing the 
requisite level of safety to the 
applicant’s workers and based on this 
assessment, whether to revise or revoke

the conditions of the modified 
permanent variance. Timely notification 
permits OSHA to take whatever action 
may be necessary and appropriate to 
prevent possible further injuries and 
illnesses. Providing notification to 
employees informs them of the 
precautions taken by the applicant to 
prevent similar incidents in the future. 
Additionally, this condition requires 
the applicant to notify OSHA if it ceases 
to do business, has a new address or 
location for the main office, or transfers 
the operations covered by the modified 
permanent variance to a successor 
company. In addition, the condition 
specifies that the transfer of the 
modified permanent variance to a 
successor company must be approved 
by OSHA. These requirements allow 
OSHA to communicate effectively with 
the applicant regarding the status of the 
modified permanent variance and 
expedite the agency’s administration 
and enforcement of the modified 
permanent variance. Stipulating that an 
applicant is required to have OSHA’s 
approval to transfer a variance to a 
successor company provides assurance 
that the successor company has 
knowledge of, and will comply with, the 
conditions specified by modified 
permanent variance, thereby ensuring 
the safety of workers involved in 
performing the operations covered by 
the modified permanent variance. 
VII. Order 
As of the effective date of this final 
order, OSHA is revoking the interim 
order granted to the applicant on July 
24, 2025 (90 FR 34887) and replacing it 
with a permanent variance order. Note 
that there are not any substantive 
changes in the conditions between the 
interim order and this final order. 
OSHA issues this final order 
authorizing McNally/ASI Marine to 
comply with the following conditions 
instead of complying with the 
requirements of 29 CFR 1926.803(e)(5), 
(f)(1), (g)(1)(iii), and (g)(1)(xvii). These 
conditions are: 
A. Scope 
The permanent variance applies only 
when McNally/ASI Marine stops the 
tunnel-boring work, pressurizes the 
working chamber, and the CAWs either 
enter the working chamber to perform 
an intervention (i.e., inspection, maintain, or repair the mechanical- 
excavation components), or exit the 
working chamber after performing 
interventions. 
The permanent variance applies only 
to work: 
1. That occurs in conjunction with 
construction of the Southerly Tunnel 
and Consolidation Project in Cleveland, 
Ohio, a subaqueous tunnel constructed 
using advanced shielded mechanical- 
excavation techniques and involving 
operation of a TBM; 
2. In the TBM’s forward section (the 
working chamber) and associated 
hyperbaric chambers used to pressurize 
and decompress employees entering and 
exiting the working chamber; and 
3. Performed in compliance with all 
applicable provisions of 29 CFR 1926 
except for the requirement specified by 
29 CFR 1926.803(e)(5), (f)(1), (g)(1)(iii), 
and (g)(1)(xvii). 
4. This order will remain in effect 
until one of the following conditions 
occurs: (1) completion of the Southerly 
Tunnel and Consolidation Project; or (2) 
OSHA modifies or revokes this final 
order in accordance with 29 CFR 
1905.13.

pressure; a pressure given in p.s.i. 
corresponds to absolute pressure. 
17. p.s.i.a—pounds per square inch absolute, or absolute pressure, is the 
sum of the atmospheric pressure and 
gauge pressure. At sea level, 
atmospheric pressure is approximately 
14.7 p.s.i. Adding 14.7 to a pressure 
expressed in units of p.s.i.g. will yield 
the absolute pressure, expressed as 
p.s.i.a. 
18. p.s.i.g.—pounds per square inch gauge, a common unit of pressure; 
pressure expressed as p.s.i.g. 
corresponds to pressure relative to 
atmospheric pressure. At sea level, 
atmospheric pressure is approximately 
14.7 p.s.i. Subtracting 14.7 from a 
pressure expressed in units of p.s.i.a. 
yields the gauge pressure, expressed as 
p.s.i.g.

20. Working chamber—an enclosed space in the TBM in which CAWs 
perform interventions, and which is 
accessible only through a man-lock. 
D. Safety and Health Practices 
1. McNally/ASI Marine must 
implement the project-specific HOM 
submitted to OSHA as part of the 
variance application (see OSHA–2025– 
0004–0003). The HOM provides the 
minimum requirements regarding 
expected safety and health hazards 
(including anticipated geological 
conditions) and hyperbaric exposures 
during the tunnel-construction project. 
2. McNally/ASI Marine must 
demonstrate that the TBM on the project 
is designed, fabricated, inspected, 
tested, marked and stamped in 
accordance with the requirements of the 
most recent edition of ASME PVHO–1 
(Safety Standards for Pressure Vessels 
for Human Occupancy) for the TBM’s 
hyperbaric chambers. 
3. McNally/ASI Marine must 
implement the safety and health 
instructions included in the 
manufacturer’s operations manuals for 
the TBM, and the safety and health 
instructions provided by the 
manufacturer for the operation of 
decompression equipment. 
4. McNally/ASI Marine must ensure 
that there are no exposures to pressures 
greater than 58 p.s.i.g. 
5. McNally/ASI Marine must ensure 
that air or oxygen is the only breathing 
gas in the working chamber. 
6. McNally/ASI Marine must follow 
the 1992 French Decompression Tables 
for air or oxygen decompression as 
specified in the HOM, specifically the 
tables titled ‘‘French Regulation Air 
Standard Tables.’’ 
7. McNally/ASI Marine must equip 
man-locks used by their employees with 
an oxygen-delivery system as specified 
by the HOM. McNally/ASI Marine is 
prohibited from storing in the tunnel 
any oxygen or other compressed gases 
used in conjunction with hyperbaric 
work. 
8. Workers performing hot work 
under hyperbaric conditions must use 
flame-retardant personal protective 
equipment and clothing. 
9. In hyperbaric work areas, McNally/ 
ASI Marine must maintain an adequate 
fire-suppression system approved for 
hyperbaric work areas. 
10. McNally/ASI Marine must 
develop and implement one or more job 
hazard analysis (JHA) for work in the 
hyperbaric work areas, and review, 
periodically and as necessary (e.g., after making changes to a planned 
intervention that affects their operation), 
the contents of the JHAs with affected 
employees. The JHAs must include all 
the job functions that the risk 
assessment
17
indicates are essential to 
prevent injury or illness. 
11. McNally/ASI Marine must 
develop a set of checklists to guide 
compressed-air work and ensure that 
employees follow the procedures 
required by this permanent variance 
(including all procedures required by 
the HOM, which this permanent 
variance incorporates by reference). The 
checklists must include all steps and 
equipment functions that the risk 
assessment indicates are essential to 
prevent injury or illness during 
compressed-air work. 
12. McNally/ASI Marine must ensure 
that the safety and health provisions of 
this project-specific HOM adequately 
protect the workers of all contractors 
and subcontractors involved in 
hyperbaric operations for the project to 
which the HOM applies.
18
 
E. Communication 
1. Prior to beginning a shift, McNally/ 
ASI Marine must implement a system 
that informs workers exposed to 
hyperbaric conditions of any hazardous 
occurrences or conditions that might 
affect their safety, including hyperbaric 
incidents, gas releases, equipment 
failures, earth or rockslides, cave-ins, 
flooding, fires, or explosions. 
2. McNally/ASI Marine must provide 
a power-assisted means of 
communication among affected workers 
and support personnel in hyperbaric 
conditions where unassisted voice 
communication is inadequate. 
(a) McNally/ASI Marine must use an 
independent power supply for powered 
communication systems, and these 
systems must operate such that use or 
disruption of any one phone or signal 
location will not disrupt the operation 
of the system from any other location. 
(b) McNally/ASI Marine must test 
communication systems at the start of 
each shift and as necessary thereafter to 
ensure proper operation. 
F. Worker Qualifications and Training 
McNally/ASI Marine must: 
1. Ensure that each affected worker 
receives effective training on how to 
safely enter, work in, exit from, and 
undertake emergency evacuation or 
rescue from, hyperbaric conditions, and 
document this training. 
2. Provide effective instruction, before 
beginning hyperbaric operations, to 
each worker who performs work, or 
controls the exposure of others, in 
hyperbaric conditions, and document 
this instruction. The instruction must 
include: 
(a) The physics and physiology of 
hyperbaric work; 
(b) Recognition of pressure-related 
injuries;

applicable to the employee in the 
project-specific HOM. 
3. Repeat the instruction specified in 
paragraph (2) of this condition 
periodically and as necessary (e.g., after making changes to their hyperbaric 
operations). 
4. When conducting training for their 
hyperbaric workers, make this training 
available to OSHA personnel and notify 
OTPCA at OSHA’s national office and 
the Cleveland, Ohio OSHA Area Office 
before the training takes place. 
G. Inspections, Tests, and Accident 
Prevention 
1. McNally/ASI Marine must initiate 
and maintain a program of frequent and 
regular inspections of the TBM’s 
hyperbaric equipment and support 
systems (such as temperature control, 
illumination, ventilation, and fire- 
prevention and fire-suppression 
systems), and hyperbaric work areas, as 
required under 29 CFR 1926.20(b)(2), 
including: 
(a) Developing a set of checklists to be 
used by a competent person in 
conducting weekly inspections of 
hyperbaric equipment and work areas; 
and 
(b) Ensuring that a competent person 
conducts daily visual checks, as well as 
weekly inspections of the TBM. 
2. McNally/ASI Marine must remove 
from service any equipment that 
constitutes a safety hazard until it 
corrects the hazardous condition and 
has the correction approved by a 
qualified person. 
3. McNally/ASI Marine must maintain 
records of all tests and inspections of 
the TBM, as well as associated 
corrective actions and repairs, at the job 
site for the duration of the tunneling 
project and for 90 days after the final 
project report is submitted to OSHA. 
H. Compression and Decompression 
McNally/ASI Marine must consult 
with their attending physician 
concerning the need for special 
compression or decompression 
exposures appropriate for CAWs not 
acclimated to hyperbaric exposure. 
I. Recordkeeping 
In addition to completing OSHA Form 
301 Injury and Illness Incident Report 
and OSHA Form 300 Log of Work- 
Related Injuries and Illnesses, McNally/ 
ASI Marine must maintain records of: 
1. The date, times (e.g., time compression started, time spent 
compressing, time performing 
intervention, time spent 
decompressing), and pressure for each 
hyperbaric intervention. 
2. The names of all supervisors and 
DMTs involved for each intervention. 
3. The name of each individual 
worker exposed to hyperbaric pressure 
and the decompression protocols and 
results for each worker. 
4. The total number of interventions 
and the amount of hyperbaric work time 
at each pressure. 
5. The results of the post-intervention 
physical assessment of each CAW for 
signs and symptoms of decompression 
illness, barotrauma, nitrogen narcosis, 
oxygen toxicity or other health effects 
associated with work in compressed air

any recordable injury, illness, or fatality 
(by submitting the completed OSHA’s 
Form 301 Injury and Illness Incident 
Report form)
19
resulting from exposure 
of an employee to hyperbaric 
conditions, including those exposures 
that do not require recompression 
treatment (e.g., nitrogen narcosis, oxygen toxicity, barotrauma), but still 
meet the recordable injury or illness 
criteria of 29 CFR 1904. The notification 
must be made within 8 hours of the 
incident or 8 hours after becoming 
aware of a recordable injury, illness, or

recordable injury, illness, or fatality. In 
addition to the information required by 
the OSHA’s Form 301 Injury and Illness 
Injury Reporting Form, the incident- 
investigation report must include a root- 
cause determination, and the preventive 
and corrective actions identified and 
implemented. 
(b) Provide certification within 15 
days of the incident that the employer 
informed affected workers of the 
incident and the results of the incident 
investigation (including the root-cause 
determination and preventive and 
corrective actions identified and

(d) Upon completion of the Southerly 
Tunnel and Consolidation Project, 
evaluate the effectiveness of the 
decompression tables used throughout 
the project, and provide a written report 
of this evaluation to the OTPCA and the 
Cleveland Ohio OSHA Area Office. 
Note: The evaluation report is to contain summaries of: (1) the number, dates, 
durations, and pressures of the hyperbaric 
interventions completed; (2) decompression 
protocols implemented (including 
composition of gas mixtures (air and/or 
oxygen), and the results achieved; (3) the 
total number of interventions and the number 
of hyperbaric incidents (decompression 
illnesses and/or health effects associated 
with hyperbaric interventions as recorded on 
OSHA’s Form 301 Injury and Illness Incident 
Report and OSHA’s Form 300 Log of Work- 
Related Injuries and Illnesses, and relevant 
medical diagnoses and treating physicians’ 
opinions); and (4) root causes of any 
hyperbaric incidents, and preventive and 
corrective actions identified and 
implemented. 
(e) To assist OSHA in administering 
the conditions specified herein, inform 
the OTPCA and the Cleveland Ohio 
OSHA Area Office as soon as possible, 
but no later than seven (7) days, after it 
has knowledge that it will: 
i. Cease to do business; 
ii. Change the location and address of 
the main office for managing the 
tunneling operations specified herein; 
or 
iii. Transfer the operations specified 
herein to a successor company. 
(f) Notify all affected employees of 
this permanent variance by the same 
means required to inform them of the 
application for a variance. 
(g) This permanent variance cannot be 
transferred to a successor company 
without OSHA approval. 
OSHA hereby grants a permanent 
variance to McNally/ASI Marine to the 
provisions of 29 CFR 1926.803 outlined 
in this notice for the completion of the

drivers of the growing population of 
youth and younger adults with 
disabilities living in nursing homes and 
explore policy solutions that seek to 
keep youth and younger adults with 
disabilities in their communities where 
they can live, learn, and seek

following questions are helpful. 
1. What number of people with 
disabilities ages 21–40 are receiving 
LTSS in nursing homes? How large is 
the subset of those under age 21? What 
are the numbers by state? What are the 
demographics? What is the average 
length of stay? What placements were 
made out of state? 
2. What data gaps exist on these 
questions and how could the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 
improve them? What reporting could 
HHS or HUD require of federal fund 
recipients to obtain data on people with 
disabilities age 40 and under in nursing 
homes? 
3. How many people are estimated to 
be on waiting lists to transfer out of 
nursing facilities are ages 21–40 and 
under 21? What federal and state 
policies assist in gathering this 
information and what are the federal 
and state barriers? 
4. Are there existing federal and state 
policies that have the effect of routing 
younger people with disabilities into 
nursing homes? (Please note that NCD is 
not seeking information on what keeps 
people with disabilities from leaving 
nursing facilities as we have well- 
established research on that topic). 
5. What impact has Money Follows 
the Person had on nursing home 
diversion for younger people with 
disabilities? Please provide specific 
examples to the degree possible. What 
other programs are successful at 
diversion of younger people with 
disabilities from nursing homes? 
6. What opportunities are available to 
younger people with disabilities who 
reside in nursing homes, for free 
appropriate public education (FAPE), 
recreation, community participation? 
What are the results of unavailability/ 
restricted availability of the activities? 
7. How could policymakers 
specifically address the needs of 
younger people with disabilities in 
LTSS and housing policy? 
II. Improving the Outcome of People 
With Disabilities During and After 
Disasters 
This project focuses on how state and 
local governments execute their 
emergency management plans; 
identifies promising practices; and 
provides resources and 
recommendations. Comments on any of 
the following questions are helpful. 
1. What elements are lacking in state 
and local disaster preparation plans that 
would mitigate the adverse impact of 
disaster recovery and response on 
people with disabilities? 
2. How do states encourage local 
emergency management operators to be 
inclusive of people with disabilities 
before, during and after disasters? 
3. What is FEMA’s role and 
responsibility to ensure people with 
disabilities needs are included in 
disaster preparation at the local level? 
4. What states have an infrastructure 
that promotes the inclusivity of people 
with disabilities?

filed an application to request the NRC 
renew its ESP for the Grand Gulf ESP 
Site for an additional 20 years beyond 
the period specified in the current 
license. The current ESP expires on 
April 7, 2027. 
In accordance with Subpart A of 10 
CFR part 52, an applicant may seek an 
ESP separate from the filing of an 
application for a construction permit 
(CP) or combined license (COL) for a 
nuclear power facility. The ESP process 
allows resolution of issues relating to 
siting, and if an application for a CP or 
COL references an early site permit, the 
Commission shall treat as resolved those 
matters resolved in the proceeding on 
the application for issuance or renewal 
of the early site permit, except as 
provided for in paragraphs (b), (c), and 
(d) of 10 CFR 52.39. 
The Grand Gulf ESP renewal 
application references and proposes to 
pilot the alternate ESP renewal method 
described in Appendix A to NEI 25–06, 
Rev 0. The NRC is reviewing NEI 25–06, 
Rev 0 and has not made a final 
determination on the acceptability of 
the proposed guidance. The application 
includes a request for an exemption 
from the requirement of 10 CFR 52.29 
that the application for renewal must 
contain all information necessary to 
bring up to date the information and 
data contained in the previous 
application. 
II. Further Information 
The NRC will publish subsequent 
Federal Register notices addressing the 
acceptability of the tendered ESP 
renewal application for docketing and, 
if the application is acceptable for 
docketing, provisions for public 
participation in the ESP renewal 
application review process, including 
an opportunity to request a hearing. The 
NRC will post publicly available 
materials related to this application in 
ADAMS and on the NRC’s public 
website.

together with the 4x Long Fund, the

ETP Trust, under BZX Rule 14.11(f)(4). 
The proposed rule change was 
published for comment in the Federal 
Register on October 3, 2025.3
 
On November 3, 2025, pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
4
the 
Commission designated a longer period 
within which to approve the proposed 
rule change, disapprove the proposed 
rule change, or institute proceedings to 
determine whether to disapprove the 
proposed rule change.
5
 
The Commission is publishing this 
order to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change from interested 
persons and to institute proceedings 
under Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act
6
to 
determine whether to approve or 
disapprove the proposed rule change. 
I. Summary of the Proposal 
As described in more detail in the 
Notice,
7
the Exchange proposes to list 
and trade Shares of the Funds under 
Rule 14.11(f)(4), which governs the 
listing and trading of Trust Issued 
Receipts on the Exchange.
8
The Funds 
seek to provide daily investment results 
(before fees and expenses) that 
correspond to the performance of a 
benchmark that seeks to offer either 
short or long exposure to the benchmark 
for the Funds.
9
The benchmark for the 
Funds is the Russell 1000 Index 
(‘‘Index’’). The Funds are ‘‘leveraged,’’ 
which means that each Fund has an 
investment objective to seek daily 
investment results, before fees and 
expenses, that correspond either to a 
multiple (4x) or an inverse multiple 
(¥4x) of the daily performance of the 
Index on a given day.
10
 
The Funds may invest in over-the- 
counter swaps referencing the Index 
(‘‘Russell Swap Agreements’’), forward 
contracts, options contracts, futures 
contracts (‘‘Russell Futures Contracts’’), 
and other Financial Instruments
11
 
based on the Index.
12
The amount of 
exposure each Fund has to a specific 
combination of Financial Instruments 
differs with each Fund and should be 
expected to change from time to time at 
the discretion of GraniteShares Advisors 
LLC based on market conditions and 
other factors.
13
The Funds may also 
invest in money market instruments 
(i.e., ‘‘Cash and Cash Equivalents’’)14
as 
part of their core investment strategy or 
to meet collateral and margin 
requirements for their Russell Futures 
Contract positions, Russell Swap 
Agreements, and Russell Option 
Contracts (collectively, ‘‘Russell 
Derivative Products’’).
15
The Exchange 
represents that the Funds seek to remain 
fully invested at all times in Russell 
Derivative Products (and Cash and Cash 
Equivalents as collateral) that provide 
exposure to the Index consistent with 
each Fund’s investment objective.

proceedings pursuant to Section 
19(b)(2)(B) of the Act
17
to determine 
whether the proposed rule change 
should be approved or disapproved. 
Institution of such proceedings is 
appropriate at this time in view of the 
legal and policy issues raised by the 
proposed rule change. Institution of 
proceedings does not indicate that the 
Commission has reached any 
conclusions with respect to any of the 
issues involved. Rather, as described 
below, the Commission seeks and 
encourages interested persons to 
provide comments on the proposed rule 
change. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the 
Act,
18
the Commission is providing 
notice of the grounds for disapproval 
under consideration. The Commission is 
instituting proceedings to allow for 
additional analysis of the proposal’s 
consistency with Section 6(b)(5) of the 
Act, which requires, among other 
things, that the rules of a national 
securities exchange be ‘‘designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative 
acts and practices, to promote just and 
equitable principles of trade,’’ and ‘‘to 
protect investors and the public 
interest.’’
19
 
The Commission asks that 
commenters address the sufficiency of 
the Exchange’s statements in support of 
the proposal, which are set forth in the 
Notice, in addition to any other 
comments they may wish to submit 
about the proposed rule change. In 
particular, the Commission seeks 
comment on whether the proposal to list 
and trade Shares of the Funds, which 
seek to provide daily investment results 
that correspond to either 400% or 
¥400% of the daily performance of the 
Index, is designed to prevent fraudulent 
and manipulative acts and practices and 
to protect investors and the public 
interest, or raises any new or novel 
concerns not previously contemplated 
by the Commission. 
III. Procedure: Request for Written 
Comments 
The Commission requests that 
interested persons provide written 
submissions of their data, views, and 
arguments with respect to the issues 
identified above, as well as any other 
concerns they may have with the 
proposal. In particular, the Commission

On December 12, 2025, FICC filed this Advance 
Notice as a proposed rule change (SR–FICC–2025– 
025) with the Commission pursuant to Section 
19(b)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), 
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder, 17 CFR 240.19b–4. A 
copy of the proposed rule change is available at 
www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings.

Partial Amendment No. 1 makes clarifications 
and corrections to the narrative description of the 
Advance Notice and Exhibit 5A of the filing. 
Specifically, the Amendment corrects the narrative 
description of a proposed change to the GSD Rules 
to accurately reflect the change, as it appears in 
Exhibit 5A. The Amendment also modifies Exhibit 
5A to correct to correct a typographical error and 
mismarked rule text as compared to the currently 
effective GSD Rules. These clarifications and 
corrections have been incorporated, as appropriate, 
into the description of the Advance Notice in Item 
II below.

The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the Advance 
Notice, as modified by Partial 
Amendment No. 1 (hereafter ‘‘Advance 
Notice’’), from interested persons and to 
extend the review period of the advance 
notice. 
I. Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Terms of Substance of the Advance 
Notice 
This Advance Notice consists of 
proposed rule changes related its cross- 
margining arrangement (the ‘‘Cross- 
Margining Arrangement’’) with the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. 
(‘‘CME’’, and collectively with FICC, the 
‘‘Clearing Organizations’’ or ‘‘Parties’’). 
The proposed rule changes consist of (i) 
a proposed Third Amended and 
Restated Cross-Margining Agreement 
(the ‘‘Third A&R Agreement’’) between 
FICC and CME, which would replace 
the Second Amended and Restated 
Cross-Margining Agreement between the 
Parties (the ‘‘Second A&R Agreement’’) 
in its entirety and would be 
incorporated into the FICC Government 
Securities Division (‘‘GSD’’) Rulebook 
(‘‘GSD Rules’’ or ‘‘Rules’’), and (ii) a 
number of related rule changes to the 
GSD Rules. Together, the proposed 
changes would extend the availability of 
the Cross-Margining Arrangement to 
positions cleared and carried for 
customers by a dually registered broker- 
dealer (‘‘BD’’) and futures commission 
merchant (‘‘FCM’’) that is a common 
member of FICC and CME (an ‘‘Eligible 
BD–FCM’’).

information that they wish to make 
available publicly, including their 
name, email address, and any other 
identifying information. 
All prospective commenters should 
follow the Commission’s instructions on 
how to submit comments, available at 
www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/how- 
submit-comment. General questions regarding the rule filing process or 
logistical questions regarding this filing 
should be directed to the Main Office of 
the Commission’s Division of Trading 
and Markets at tradingandmarkets@
sec.gov or 202–551–5777. FICC reserves the right not to respond 
to any comments received. 
(B) Advance Notice Filed Pursuant to 
Section 806(e) of the Clearing 
Supervision Act 
Currently, the Cross-Margining 
Arrangement allows FICC and CME to 
recognize for margin purposes the 
offsetting risk of certain positions in 
futures on U.S. Treasury securities and 
other interest rate futures and Treasury 
market transactions (‘‘Eligible 
Positions’’) maintained by a member of 
both Clearing Organizations (a ‘‘Joint 
Clearing Member’’) for itself or certain 
eligible affiliates (an ‘‘Eligible 
Affiliate’’), or by affiliated members of 
CME and FICC (each, a ‘‘Cross- 
Margining Affiliate,’’ and each Joint 
Clearing Member and each Cross- 
Margining Affiliate, a ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Participant’’), at the two Clearing 
Organizations in circumstances when 
the Clearing Organizations can look to 
all of those positions (and all associated 
margin) for performance of the Joint 
Clearing Member’s or a pair of Cross- 
Margining Affiliates’ obligations (the 
‘‘Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement’’). In particular, the 
Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement allows the Clearing 
Organizations to consider the net risk of 
a Joint Clearing Member’s and its 
Eligible Affiliates’ Eligible Positions or a 
pair of Cross-Margining Affiliates’ 
Eligible Positions at FICC and CME 
when setting margin requirements for 
such positions.
6
Any resulting margin 
reductions create capital efficiencies for 
the Cross-Margining Participants and 
their Eligible Affiliates and incentivize 
them to maintain or carry portfolios that 
present lower overall risk. 
FICC and CME have submitted to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ‘‘Commission’’) and the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission (the 
‘‘CFTC’’) petitions for exemptive relief 
from certain provisions of the 
Commodity Exchange Act (‘‘CEA’’) and 
Exchange Act that would enable FICC 
and CME to make cross-margining 
available to customers (other than an 
Eligible Affiliate) of an Eligible BD–FCM 
(‘‘Cross-Margining Customers’’).
7
The 
proposed rule changes aim to set forth 
a customer cross-margining arrangement 
that is consistent with the descriptions 
in the Petitions and the requirements of 
the Proposed Orders (the ‘‘Customer 
Cross-Margining Arrangement’’). The 
Customer Cross-Margining Arrangement 
would allow Cross-Margining 
Customers to benefit from the margin 
reductions that are currently only 
available to Cross-Margining 
Participants and their Eligible Affiliates 
under the Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement. As a result, it would 
facilitate access to clearing for indirect 
participants, promote the maintenance 
of more balanced portfolios that present 
lower risk, and enhance liquidity in, 
and otherwise promote the resilience 
and robustness of, the Treasury market. 
The Third A&R Agreement would 
effectuate the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement via the following features: 
€Eligibility Criteria and Participation Requirements. The Third A&R Agreement would set out the eligibility 
criteria for a Joint Clearing Member and 
its Cross-Margining Customer to 
participate in the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement, as well as the 
requirements that would apply to such 
a Joint Clearing Member and its Cross- 
Margining Customer. These include the 
requirements that: 
ÆA Joint Clearing Member be an Eligible BD–FCM; 
ÆEach Cross-Margining Customer be a ‘‘futures customer’’ within the 
meaning of CFTC Regulation 1.3 and a 
‘‘Sponsored Member’’ or ‘‘Eligible Firm 
Customer’’ as defined under the GSD 
Rules; 
ÆThe Joint Clearing Member enter into a participant agreement with the 
Clearing Organizations; and 
ÆThe Joint Clearing Member enter into an agreement with each Cross- 
Margining Customer containing certain 
terms, including that the Cross- 
Margining Customer agrees to 
subordinate its claims under the 
Securities Investor Protection Act of 
1970 (‘‘SIPA’’) and subchapter III of 
Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code 
in relation to its cross-margined 
positions and associated margin (the 
‘‘Subordination Agreement’’). 
As discussed in greater detail below, 
these criteria and requirements for 
participation are designed to ensure that 
each participating Cross-Margining 
Customer and its Joint Clearing Member 
satisfy certain conditions set forth in the 
Proposed Orders. 
€Customer Cross-Margining Accounts. The Third A&R Agreement would include provisions to enable 
Eligible BD–FCMs to establish 
‘‘Customer Cross-Margining Accounts’’ 
for purposes of recording Eligible 
Positions at the Clearing Organizations 
(such Eligible Positions in a Customer 
Cross-Margining Account, ‘‘Customer 
Positions’’) and set forth a definition of 
‘‘Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Accounts’’ to refer to the accounts 
established by Eligible BD–FCMs at the 
Clearing Organizations for the purposes 
of recording positions subject to the 
Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement (‘‘Proprietary Positions’’). 
€Margin Methodology. The Third A&R Agreement would include 
provisions describing the methodology 
for calculating potential reductions to 
the margin requirements for Customer 
Positions. As discussed in greater detail

The SLA is provided as confidential Exhibit 3 
to this proposed rule change. 
9
See Section 2(a) of the proposed Third A&R Agreement. 
below, FICC is proposing to apply the 
same margin reduction methodology to 
Customer Positions as it applies to 
Proprietary Positions, with margin 
reductions calculated on a customer-by- 
customer basis for each Cross-Margining 
Customer. 
€Default Management. The Third A&R Agreement would include 
provisions to address how the Clearing 
Organizations would manage a default 
of a Cross-Margining Participant (a 
‘‘Defaulting Member’’) carrying 
positions for Cross-Margining 
Customers. Under the Third A&R 
Agreement, the Clearing Organizations 
would follow substantially the same 
approach to handling Customer 
Positions carried by a Defaulting 
Member as applies to Proprietary 
Positions. However, Customer Positions 
and Proprietary Positions and associated 
margin would form part of separate 
‘‘Liquidation Portfolios’’ and therefore 
would not be netted against one another 
in calculating Net Gain or Net Loss (or 
VM Net Gain or VM Net Loss) under the 
Cross-Margining Agreement. By virtue 
of these changes, the Clearing 
Organizations would not be able to 
apply Customer Positions or associated 
margin to the obligations arising under 
a Defaulting Member’s Proprietary 
Positions. The Third A&R Agreement 
would also include edits clarifying that 
the Clearing Organizations may ‘‘port’’ 
Customer Positions to another clearing 
member in a default scenario. 
In addition to replacing the Second 
A&R Agreement with the Third A&R 
Agreement, FICC proposes the following 
changes to the GSD Rules to effectuate 
the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement: 
€Account Structure. FICC proposes to create a new Account type, the 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Account,’’ 
for purposes of recording FICC-cleared 
Customer Positions. 
€Margin Methodology and Treatment. As discussed in greater detail below, under the proposed 
changes, FICC would collect and hold 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin in a 
substantially similar manner to how it 
collects and holds ‘‘Segregated 
Customer Margin’’ (as defined under the 
GSD Rules), with certain adjustments to 
ensure consistency with the 
requirements of the Proposed Orders 
and the general requirements and 
conventions applicable to futures. 
Consistent with how it treats Segregated 
Customer Margin, FICC would credit all 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
collected from an Eligible BD–FCM to a 
securities account on its books and 
records in the name of the Eligible BD– 
FCM for the benefit of its customers (a 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Custody Account’’). FICC would also 
agree to treat all assets credited to the 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Custody Account as ‘‘financial assets’’ 
credited to a ‘‘securities account’’ for 
which FICC is the ‘‘securities 
intermediary,’’ as such terms are used in 
Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial 
Code as in effect in the State of New 
York (‘‘NYUCC’’). This treatment is 
designed to ensure that Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin does not form part of 
FICC’s bankruptcy estate and is not 
exposed to the claims of FICC’s general 
creditors, and is instead reserved for 
Eligible BD–FCMs claiming on behalf of 
their Cross-Margining Customers. 
Consistent with how it holds Segregated 
Customer Margin, FICC would hold 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin in a 
segregated account at a bank insured by 
the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation and at the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York (the ‘‘FRBNY’’). In 
accordance with the Proposed Orders, 
any such account (other than one at the 
FRBNY) would need to be subject to a 
written notice consistent with the 
Proposed Orders. 
€Conforming and Clarifying Changes. FICC proposes to make a number of clarifying and conforming 
edits to the GSD Rules, including (i) 
adding references to Cross-Margining 
Customer, Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin, Cross-Margining Customer 
Account, and Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin Requirements to relevant 
provisions that refer to indirect 
participants, initial margin collected by 
FICC, position accounts maintained by 
FICC, and FICC’s initial margin 
requirements; (ii) removing the existing 
prohibition under Section 10(e) of Rule 
3A on Sponsored Members from 
participating in the Cross-Margining 
Arrangement; (iii) expanding Rule 43, 
which sets forth certain terms related to 
the Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, to encompass the 
Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement; and (iv) removing 
references to the Market Professionals 
cross-margining arrangement, which is 
no longer offered by FICC. 
The Third A&R Agreement would also 
include a number of clarifying and 
conforming edits, including to make 
clear that, with respect to both the 
Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement and Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement, FICC and CME 
would only manage a default of a Joint 
Clearing Member independently of one 
another if a joint management or buy- 
out by one of the Clearing Organizations 
were not legally permissible or possible 
or would result in substantially greater 
losses to each Clearing Organization. 
In addition, the Second A&R 
Agreement is supplemented by a 
Service Level Agreement (‘‘SLA’’) 
between FICC and CME. FICC and CME 
will make edits to the SLA as necessary 
to ensure conformance with the 
proposed Third A&R Agreement.
8
 
Description of Proposed Changes 
(i) The Proposed Third A&R Agreement 
As noted above, FICC proposes to 
enter into the Third A&R Agreement 
with CME. The proposed changes to the 
Second A&R Agreement contained in 
the Third A&R Agreement are designed 
to make cross-margining available to 
Cross-Margining Customers consistently 
with the framework set out in the 
Proposed Orders. FICC believes that 
such amendments would promote the 
maintenance of more balanced 
portfolios that present lower risk and 
facilitate the access of indirect 
participants to central clearing in 
accordance with Rule 17ad–22 under 
the Exchange Act. 
A. Eligibility Criteria and Participation 
Requirements 
a. Eligibility Criteria for Joint Clearing 
Members 
The Third A&R Agreement would set 
forth the eligibility criteria for a Cross- 
Margining Participant to participate in 
the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement. To facilitate compliance 
with the conditions and limitations of 
the Proposed Orders, Section 2(a) of the 
Third A&R Agreement would provide 
that, to become a Cross-Margining 
Participant for the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement and establish a 
Customer Cross-Margining Account, a 
Clearing Member would need to be a 
Joint Clearing Member that is both a BD 
registered with the Commission and an 
FCM registered with the CFTC (i.e., an Eligible BD–FCM).
9
Section 3(a) of the 
Third A&R Agreement would further 
require that the Eligible BD–FCM hold 
the Cross-Margining Customer’s 
Customer Positions at FICC and 
associated money, securities and 
property together with such customer’s 
Customer Positions at CME and the 
associated ‘‘futures customer funds,’’ as 
defined in CFTC Regulation 1.3, held by 
the Eligible BD–FCM, in a ‘‘futures 
account,’’ as defined in CFTC 
Regulation 1.3, ‘‘in accordance with any 
conditions set forth in the regulatory 
approvals of [the Third A&R Agreement]

such person or entity itself or certain affiliates, as 
well as such account ‘‘of which ten percent or more 
is owned by . . . or an aggregate of ten percent or

issued by [the Commission] and CFTC 
and applicable law.’’
10
 
In addition, the Eligible BD–FCM 
would be required to enter into a 
participant agreement with FICC and 
CME in the form of Appendix C to the 
Third A&R Agreement (the ‘‘Customer 
Cross-Margining Clearing Member 
Agreement’’), which is further described 
below.
11
The definition of ‘‘Clearing 
Member Agreement’’ would 
correspondingly be amended to refer, 
with respect to the Proprietary Cross- 
Margining Arrangement, to the existing 
participant agreement currently in 
Appendix A or Appendix B of the 
Second A&R Agreement (the 
‘‘Proprietary Clearing Member 
Agreement’’), as applicable, and with 
respect to the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, to the Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing Member 
Agreement.
12
 
As a conforming change, Sections 2(a) 
and (c) and the first sentence of Section 
2(a) of the Third A&R Agreement would 
also be amended to provide that the pre- 
existing language therein applies to a 
Cross-Margining Participant for the 
Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement.
13
 
b. Definition of Customer and Non- 
Customer 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement would only be available 
for the positions carried by an Eligible 
BD–FCM for ‘‘Customers.’’ To ensure 
compliance with the limitations under 
the Proposed Orders of the types of 
persons eligible to be Cross-Margining 
Customers, the Third A&R Agreement 
would define ‘‘Customer’’ as an indirect 
clearing participant that meets the 
definition of futures customer set out in 
CFTC Regulation 1.3 and is a 
‘‘Sponsored Member’’ or ‘‘Executing 
Firm Customer’’ as defined under the 
GSD Rules.
14
CFTC Regulation 1.3 
defines ‘‘futures customer’’ to mean any 
person who uses an FCM as an agent in 
connection with trading in any futures 
contract, but excludes persons whose 
futures positions are held in a 
‘‘proprietary account.’’
15
Any Customer 
wishing to participate in the Customer 
Cross-Margining Arrangement would 
need to enter into an agreement with its 
Eligible BD–FCM that includes certain 
terms described in greater detail below 
(the ‘‘Customer Agreement’’).
16
Because 
affiliates of the Eligible BD–FCM would 
generally have their CME-cleared 
futures positions held in a proprietary 
account of the Eligible BD–FCM, such 
affiliates would not constitute ‘‘futures 
customers’’ under CFTC Regulation 1.3. 
However, Eligible Affiliates would 
continue to be able to access cross- 
margining under the Proprietary Cross- 
Margining Arrangement so long as they 
constitute ‘‘Non-Customers.’’
17
The 
Third A&R Agreement would revise the 
definition of ‘‘Non-Customer’’ to mean 
any affiliate of the Eligible BD–FCM or 
any person that is an officer, director, 
partner or other related person of the 
Eligible BD–FCM (i) that is not a 
‘‘customer’’ of the Eligible BD–FCM 
within the meaning of SIPA, Subchapter 
III of Chapter VII of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code, or Exchange Act Rule 15c3–3 and 
(ii) whose CME-cleared positions are 
carried in a proprietary account of the 
Eligible BD–FCM.
18
 
c. Relationship Between the Clearing 
Organizations and Cross-Margining 
Customers 
Because a Cross-Margining 
Customer’s participation in the 
Customer Cross-Margining Arrangement 
would be intermediated through the 
Eligible BD–FCM, Section 2(a) of the 
Third A&R Agreement would specify 
that the Clearing Organizations would 
have no obligation to deal directly with 
a Cross-Margining Customer, and that a 
Cross-Margining Customer would have 
no right to assert a claim against a 
Clearing Organization with respect to, 
nor would a Clearing Organization be 
liable to a Cross-Margining Customer 
for, any obligations of a Clearing 
Organization in connection with the 
Cross-Margining Customer’s 
participation in the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement pursuant to the 
Third A&R Agreement.
19
These terms 
are consistent with those applicable to 
Eligible Firm Customers under the GSD 
Rules, as well as those applicable to 
customers under CME’s rules.
20
 
B. Customer Cross-Margining Account 
To effectuate the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement, the Third A&R 
Agreement would include changes to 
enable an Eligible BD–FCM to establish 
a ‘‘Customer Cross-Margining Account’’ 
separate from any of its ‘‘Proprietary 
Cross-Margining Accounts.’’ 
A Customer Cross-Margining Account 
would be defined as, with respect to 
FICC, an Indirect Participants Account 
(as defined in the GSD Rules) at FICC 
maintained for Cross-Margining 
Customers and identified in FICC’s 
books and records as being subject to 
the Third A&R Agreement (which, as 
discussed below, would be the ‘‘Cross- 
Margining Customer Account’’ under 
the GSD Rules) and with respect to 
CME, an account carried on the books 
and records of CME for an Eligible BD– 
FCM, which contains only the positions, 
transactions, and margin of that Eligible 
BD–FCM’s Cross-Margining 
Customers.
21
A Proprietary Cross- 
Margining Account would be defined 
as, with respect to FICC, a Proprietary 
Account at FICC (as defined in the GSD 
Rules) or an Indirect Participants 
Account at FICC that is maintained for 
Non-Customers and identified in FICC’s 
books and records as being subject to 
the Third A&R Agreement, and, with 
respect to CME, an account carried on 
the books and records of CME for an

Eligible BD–FCM, which contains only 
the positions, transactions, and margin 
of the ‘‘proprietary accounts’’ (as 
defined in CFTC Regulation 1.3) of the 
Eligible BD–FCM.
22
 
The Third A&R Agreement would also 
define ‘‘Cross-Margining Account’’ to 
mean either a Proprietary Cross- 
Margining Account or a Customer Cross- 
Margining Account.
23
An Eligible BD– 
FCM would be required to designate 
each Cross-Margining Account it opens 
at the Clearing Organizations as either a 
Customer Cross-Margining Account or a 
Proprietary Cross-Margining Account.
24
 
C. Margin Methodology 
The Third A&R Agreement would also 
specify how potential margin reductions 
would be calculated for Customer 
Positions carried in a Customer Cross- 
Margining Account. As with Proprietary 
Positions, each Clearing Organization 
would calculate the margin savings that 
would result from viewing the 
‘‘Combined Portfolio’’ of CME-cleared 
Customer Positions and FICC-cleared 
Customer Positions as a single portfolio 
rather than as separate standalone 
portfolios. The Clearing Organizations 
would then compare the respective 
margin reduction percentages, and each 
would then reduce the margin required 
for the Combined Portfolio by the lower 
percentage (subject to a cap of 80%). For 
Customer Positions, this process would 
occur on a Cross-Margining Customer- 
by-Cross-Margining Customer basis. In 
other words, each Cross-Margining 
Customer’s Customer Positions would 
form part of a separate Combined 
Portfolio. This customer-by-customer 
approach is consistent both with how 
futures contracts are required to be 
margined under the rules of the CFTC, 
as well as how FICC margins Segregated 
Indirect Participant positions.
25
 
To implement this margin reduction 
methodology, the Third A&R Agreement 
would redefine ‘‘Combined Portfolio’’ to 
mean, in the case of a Pair of Cross- 
Margining Accounts consisting of 
Proprietary Cross-Margining Accounts, 
all Eligible Positions in such Cross- 
Margining Accounts, and in the case of 
a Pair of Cross-Margining Accounts 
consisting of Customer Cross-Margining 
Accounts, all Eligible Positions of a 
single Customer in such Cross- 
Margining Accounts.
26
The term ‘‘Pair 
of Cross-Margining Accounts’’, in turn, 
would be defined to mean a Customer 
Cross-Margining Account at CME and a 
Customer Cross-Margining Account at 
FICC or a Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Account at CME and a Proprietary 
Cross-Margining Account at FICC.
27
The 
Third A&R Agreement would clarify 
that an Eligible BD–FCM would only be 
able to establish one Pair of Cross- 
Margining Accounts for each type of 
Indirect Participants Account offered at 
FICC under the GSD Rules and that the 
Customer Positions of the same Cross- 
Margining Customer may not be 
maintained in multiple Pairs of Cross- 
Margining Accounts of the same Eligible 
BD–FCM.
28
This limitation is aimed at 
ensuring that, as is the case with futures 
contracts, an Eligible BD–FCM would 
not be permitted to establish a separate 
account at the Clearing Organization for 
a particular customer or group of 
customers. 
In addition to these changes, the 
Third A&R Agreement would include 
conforming changes in Section 4 to 
make clear that the margin calculations 
are performed on the Combined 
Portfolio and to provide that Sections 
4(c) and 4(e), concerning the ability of 
the Clearing Organizations to require 
margin equal to or in excess of the 
Standalone Margin Requirement, would 
apply in relation to each Cross- 
Margining Account.
29
The Third A&R 
Agreement would also make conforming 
changes to a number of defined terms 
by: 
€Revising the definition of ‘‘Cross- Margin Requirement’’ to refer to the 
joint amount of Margin required by 
FICC and CME in connection with a 
Combined Portfolio as provided for in 
Section 4(a) of the Third A&R 
Agreement; 
€Revising definitions of ‘‘Margin Reduction’’ and ‘‘Variation Margin’’ to 
clarify that these terms apply separately 
with respect to Proprietary Cross- 
Margining Accounts and Customer 
Cross-Margining Accounts; 
€Further revising the ‘‘Variation Margin’’ definition to reflect that 
amounts may be owed by or to a Cross- 
Margining Customer in relation to 
positions recorded in a Customer Cross- 
Margining Account; 
€Revising the definition of ‘‘Stand- Alone Margin Requirement’’ to provide 
that it is determined with respect to a 
particular Cross-Margining Account, 
and that with regard to a Stand-Alone 
Margin Requirement of FICC, such 
requirement is calculated without 
regard to any netting across positions of 
multiple Executing Firm Customers in 
the same Agent Clearing Member 
Omnibus Account (as such terms are 
defined in the GSD Rules); 
€Revising the definition of ‘‘Margin’’ to include Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin securing the obligations of a 
Cross-Margining Customer and to 
contemplate a Joint Clearing Member 
having multiple Cross-Margining 
Accounts; and 
€Removing the definition of ‘‘Cross- Margin Positions’’, which would no 
longer be used.
30
 
Section 6(b) of the Third A&R 
Agreement would be revised to require 
FICC and CME to notify each other in 
the event a material problem arises with 
respect to a Cross-Margining Customer 
in the same manner as they are 
currently required to do with respect to 
Cross-Margining Participants.
31
 
D. Default Management 
The Third A&R Agreement would 
include certain adjustments to the 
default management provisions to 
describe how the Clearing Organizations 
would address a default of an Eligible 
BD–FCM that is carrying Customer 
Positions for Cross-Margining 
Customers, elaborate on the steps the 
Clearing Organizations may take in a 
joint liquidation, and clarify when the 
Clearing Organizations may manage the 
default of a Cross-Margining Participant 
independently of one another. 
The Third A&R Agreement would 
subject Customer Positions to 
substantially the same default 
management process as Proprietary 
Positions. In particular, under Section 
7(b) of the Third A&R Agreement, the 
Clearing Organizations would attempt 
in good faith to jointly transfer, 
liquidate, or close-out the Proprietary 
Positions or Customer Positions, which 
may include a joint liquidating auction 
so that hedged positions can be closed- 
out simultaneously or, in the case of a 
transfer of Customer Positions, so that 
the positions of each Cross-Margining 
Customer in a Combined Portfolio can, 
if feasible, be transferred to the same 
clearing firm. Section 7(b) would further 
provide that if one Clearing 
Organization determines that such joint 
action is not feasible or advisable for 
any Liquidation Portfolio, then either 
Clearing Organization could buy-out the 
Proprietary Positions or Customer

7(a) of the proposed Third A&R Agreement 
Continued 
Positions in such Liquidation Portfolio 
at the other Clearing Organization in 
accordance with the existing terms of 
the Third A&R agreement related to buy- 
outs. Lastly, Section 7(b) would provide 
that if one Clearing Organization 
determines that neither the joint 
transfer, liquidation, or close-out option 
nor the buy-out option is legally 
permissible or possible as to a particular 
Liquidation Portfolio, or if such 
methods would result in substantially 
greater losses to each Clearing 
Organization than in the case of a 
separate liquidation by each Clearing 
Organization, the Clearing 
Organizations could conduct separate 
liquidations in accordance with the 
existing terms related to such separate 
liquidations.
32
The Clearing 
Organizations do not foresee particular 
circumstances that could lead to 
separate liquidations being applicable. 
To the contrary, the Clearing 
Organizations believe it is highly 
unlikely that they would engage in 
separate liquidations. However, the 
Clearing Organizations believe it is 
prudent to have a separate liquidation 
option so that there is a clear 
methodology in the very unlikely event 
that some unforeseen circumstance 
causes it not to be possible or legally 
permissible to conduct a joint 
liquidation or buy-out or for such 
methods to result in substantially 
greater costs. 
The Third A&R Agreement would also 
include provisions designed to ensure 
that Customer Positions and associated 
margin are not used by either Clearing 
Organization to satisfy obligations 
arising from Proprietary Positions. The 
principal mechanism to achieve this 
would be a new concept of a 
‘‘Liquidation Portfolio,’’ which would 
be defined as, with respect to a 
Defaulting Member, all such Defaulting 
Member’s Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Account(s) or all such Defaulting 
Member’s Customer Cross-Margining 
Account(s).
33
The definitions of 
‘‘Collateral on Hand’’, ‘‘Net Gain’’, ‘‘Net 
Loss’’, ‘‘Cross-Margin VM Gain’’, 
‘‘Cross-Margin VM Loss’’, ‘‘Other VM 
Gain’’, ‘‘Liquidation Cost’’, and ‘‘Share 
of the Cross-Margining Requirement’’, in 
turn, would be revised so that they are 
separately determined by reference to 
each Liquidation Portfolio, rather than 
to a Defaulting Member or Cross- 
Margining Account.
34
The Third A&R 
Agreement would also provide for the 
concept of a ‘‘Related GSD Account’’, 
which would be defined as, with respect 
to a Liquidation Portfolio of a Defaulting 
Member consisting of Proprietary Cross- 
Margining Accounts, the ‘‘Proprietary 
Accounts’’ (as defined in the GSD Rules) 
of the Defaulting Member at FICC, and 
with respect to a Liquidation Portfolio 
of a Defaulting Member consisting of 
Customer Cross-Margining Accounts, 
the Indirect Participant Account(s) of 
the Defaulting Member at FICC.
35
 
In addition, the Third A&R Agreement 
would revise Sections 7(b) through (g) to 
clarify that the provisions thereof would 
apply separately to each Liquidation 
Portfolio. These changes include 
replacing certain references to ‘‘Cross- 
Margining Account’’ with ‘‘Liquidation 
Portfolio,’’
36
additional language 
specifying that provisions apply with 
respect to each Liquidation Portfolio,
37
 
and deletions of language providing for 
liquidation actions or calculations to be 
performed with respect to a Defaulting 
Member.
38
In addition, as mentioned 
above, the definition of ‘‘Combined 
Portfolio’’ would be revised to mean, in 
the case of a Pair of Cross-Margining 
Accounts consisting of Proprietary 
Cross-Margining Accounts, all Eligible 
Positions in such Cross-Margining 
Accounts, and in the case of a Pair of 
Cross-Margining Accounts consisting of 
Customer Cross-Margining Accounts, all 
Eligible Positions of a single Customer 
in such Cross-Margining Accounts.
39
 
By virtue of these changes, upon a 
default of a Joint Clearing Member, the 
Proprietary Positions and associated 
margin of the Joint Clearing Member 
would be closed-out and netted into a 
single Net Gain or Net Loss, and the 
Customer Positions and associated 
margin would be separately close-out 
and netted into a separate Net Gain or 
Net Loss. As a result of these separate 
calculations, Customer Positions and 
associated margin could not be used to 
satisfy obligations arising under any 
Proprietary Positions. Similarly, 
variation margin gains in respect of 
Customer Positions would not be 
available to address losses on 
Proprietary Positions. However, the 
definition of ‘‘Other VM Gains’’ would 
be modified to make clear that, if there 
were Cross-Margin VM Gains in relation 
to Proprietary Positions at a time when 
the Clearing Organization with those 
Cross-Margin VM Gains also had losses 
on account of Customer Positions, the 
VM Gains may first be applied to satisfy 
the losses on the Customer Positions 
before being remitted to the other 
Clearing Organization.
40
 
Although the Clearing Organizations 
would generally close-out and net the 
Liquidation Portfolios of a Defaulting 
Member separately, Section 7(a) of the 
Third A&R Agreement would provide 
that the decision as to whether to 
commence the liquidation process with 
respect to a Joint Clearing Member 
would be made based on the Joint 
Clearing Member itself, rather than a 
particular Liquidation Portfolio. In 
accordance with this framework, 
Section 7(a) of the Third A&R 
Agreement would provide that if one 
Clearing Organization decides not to 
take default action against a Defaulting 
Member following a Default Event (the 
‘‘Non-Liquidating CO’’), the Non- 
Liquidating CO shall immediately 
require the Defaulting Member to pay 
the Non-Liquidating CO in immediately 
available funds the sum of (x) its Margin 
Reduction at the other Clearing 
Organization for all Combined Portfolios 
of the Defaulting Member, and (y) its 
Margin Reduction at the Non- 
Liquidating CO for all Combined 
Portfolios of the Defaulting Member, 
within one hour of demand.
41
 
E. Conforming Changes 
The Third A&R Agreement would also 
include a number of conforming 
changes in light of the addition of the 
Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement. These would include new 
recitals which describe the purpose of 
the Third A&R Agreement as to 
establish the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, introduce defined terms 
for the ‘‘Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement’’ and ‘‘Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement’’, and define 
the prior versions of the agreement as 
the ‘‘Original Agreement’’, the ‘‘First 
A&R Agreement’’, and the ‘‘Second A&R 
Agreement.’’ They would also include 
non-substantive revisions and 
movements of defined terms as shown 
in Exhibit 5 to conform to the addition 
of the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement and the provisions 
described above.

The Third A&R Agreement would also 
revise Section 3(b), which sets out 
certain requirements applicable to 
positions of Eligible Affiliates, to 
provide that it does not apply to 
Proprietary Positions of a Joint Clearing 
Member or to Customer Positions.
43
 
In addition, the Third A&R Agreement 
would revise Section 7(i) to clarify that 
the requirement for a Defaulting 
Member to reimburse a Clearing 
Organization in the event that the 
Clearing Organization is obligated to 
make a guaranty payment to the other 
Clearing Organization in respect of an 
obligation of such Defaulting Member 
applies in respect of the obligations of 
any Cross-Margining Customer.
44
 
F. Clarifying Edits 
The Third A&R Agreement would also 
include a number of clarifying edits not 
specifically related to the Customer 
Cross-Margining Arrangement. 
Specifically, Section 2(f) of the Third 
A&R Agreement would specify that 
FICC or CME may terminate the 
participation of a particular Cross- 
Margining Participant with respect to 
some or all Cross-Margining Accounts of 
the Cross-Margining Participant upon 
two business days’ prior written notice 
to the other Clearing Organization, 
provided that no such termination 
would be effective with respect to any 
reimbursement obligation or guaranty 
with respect to such Cross-Margining 
Participant that was incurred prior to 
such termination, or with respect to 
Section 7 of the Third A&R Agreement 
until the Stand-Alone Margin 
Requirement with respect to each Cross- 
Margining Account subject to such 
termination has been fully satisfied.
45
 
The Third A&R Agreement would also 
include a new Section 5 to make clear 
that, as is currently the case, the 
collateral acceptable to satisfy the Cross- 
Margin Requirement must meet the 
respective eligibility requirements of the 
Clearing Organization to which the 
collateral is posted.
46
 
In addition, the titles of the 
Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Agreements in Appendix A and 
Appendix B of the Third A&R 
Agreement would be amended to 
specify that they are for use in 
connection with the Proprietary Cross- 
Margining Arrangement.
47
 
G. Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement 
As described above, an Eligible BD– 
FCM would be required to enter into the 
Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement in order to 
participate in the Customer Cross- 
Margining Agreement. The Customer 
Cross-Margining Clearing Member 
Agreement would be set forth in 
Appendix C to the Third A&R 
Agreement.
48
 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement would be 
modeled on the Proprietary Clearing 
Member Agreement in Appendix A of 
the Second A&R Agreement (the 
‘‘Existing Joint Clearing Member 
Proprietary Clearing Member 
Agreement’’), with changes designed to 
facilitate compliance with the 
conditions in the Proposed Orders and 
to clarify the rights and obligations of 
the Clearing Organizations, the Eligible 
BD–FCM, and the Cross-Margining 
Customers.
49
 
The first three paragraphs of the 
Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement would be 
substantially identical to those of the 
Existing Joint Clearing Member 
Proprietary Clearing Member 
Agreement, except that the first 
paragraph would note that the Eligible 
BD–FCM is electing to become a Cross- 
Margining Participant for purposes of 
the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, rather than the Cross- 
Margining Arrangement generally, and 
the third paragraph (concerning the 
Eligible BD–FCM’s payment obligations) 
would reference the payment 
obligations arising in respect of 
Customer Cross-Margining Accounts. 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement would 
provide that the Eligible BD–FCM 
makes application to the Clearing 
Organizations to establish a Customer 
Cross-Margining Account at CME and 
one or more Customer Cross-Margining 
Accounts at FICC in the name of the 
Eligible BD–FCM, and clarify that each 
such account would be in addition to 
any Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Account of the Eligible BD–FCM 
established pursuant to the Third A&R 
Agreement. The Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing Member Agreement 
would provide that each Customer 
Cross-Margining Account shall be 
limited to transactions and positions 
carried by the Eligible BD–FCM for 
Cross-Margining Customers who have 
signed a Customer Agreement. The 
Eligible BD–FCM would be required to 
agree that it shall not commence 
clearing transactions through or carrying 
positions in a Customer Cross- 
Margining Account for any Cross- 
Margining Customer until such Cross- 
Margining Customer has executed a 
Customer Agreement. 
The Eligible BD–FCM would be 
required under the Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing Member Agreement 
to indemnify and hold harmless the 
Clearing Organizations, their respective 
directors, officers and employees and 
each person, if any, who controls either 
of the Clearing Organizations against 
any claims, losses, liabilities and 
expenses, including, without limitation, 
reasonable legal fees and expenses and 
amounts paid or payable in settlement 
of any action, proceeding or 
investigation arising from any claim by 
any party resulting from the carrying of 
positions in a Customer Cross- 
Margining Account that belong to any 
person other than a Cross-Margining 
Customer for whom a Customer 
Agreement is in effect. 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement would 
provide that the Eligible BD–FCM, as 
agent for each of its Cross-Margining 
Customers, (i) unconditionally promises 
immediate payment of any payment or 
reimbursement obligations to a Clearing 
Organization arising under the Third 
A&R Agreement or the GSD Rules or 
rules of CME in respect of a Cross- 
Margining Customer’s positions in a 
Customer Cross-Margining Account, and 
(ii) agrees that each Cross-Margining 
Customer is bound by the GSD Rules 
and the rules of CME as applicable to 
them and by the provisions of the 
Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement and the Third A&R 
Agreement. The Eligible BD–FCM 
would also be required to represent and 
warrant to the Clearing Organizations 
that it has full power and authority to 
bind each of its Cross-Margining 
Customers to the terms in the foregoing 
sentence. 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement would also 
provide for the Eligible BD–FCM to

pledge, as security for its and its Cross- 
Margining Customers’ present and 
future payment and reimbursement 
obligations to FICC and CME arising 
from its Customer Cross-Margining 
Accounts or otherwise under the 
Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement on behalf of itself 
and each Cross-Margining Customer, 
and grant to each Clearing Organization 
a first priority continuing security 
interest in, lien on and right of set-off 
against all of the positions, margin 
deposits or other property held by or 
subject to the control of or owing from 
either Clearing Organization including 
any and all Net Gains in respect of the 
Eligible BD–FCM’s Customer Cross- 
Margining Accounts and the proceeds in 
respect thereof. 
The Eligible BD–FCM would also 
provide for the Eligible BD–FCM to 
agree that (i) the rights of each Clearing 
Organization set forth in the preceding 
paragraph are in addition to any other 
rights arising out of the NYUCC or other 
statute, common law, or governmental 
regulation, or under their respective 
rules, (ii) the Eligible BD–FCM will 
execute, deliver, file and record any 
financing statement, specific assignment 
or other document and take any other 
action necessary or desirable and 
reasonably requested by FICC or CME to 
create, preserve, perfect or validate the 
security interest or lien granted in this 
paragraph, to enable such Clearing 
Organization to exercise or enforce its 
rights, (iii) the Eligible BD–FCM will 
promptly give notice to the Clearing 
Organizations of, and defend against, 
any suit, action, proceeding or lien that 
involves or could adversely affect the 
security interest and lien granted by the 
Eligible BD–FCM, and (iv) the Eligible 
BD–FCM authorizes FICC to comply 
with CME’s entitlement orders with 
respect to any Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin pursuant to the Third 
A&R Agreement without further consent 
of the Eligible BD–FCM or Cross- 
Margining Customer for whom such 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin is 
held. Clauses (i) through (iii) broadly 
align with the Existing Joint Clearing 
Member Proprietary Clearing Member 
Agreement, while clause (iv) would be 
designed to facilitate the perfection of 
CME’s security interest in the Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin and help 
ensure that Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin is treated as ‘‘customer 
property’’ under Part 190 of the CFTC’s 
regulations, as described in the 
Petitions. 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement would 
contain the same provision regarding 
the disclosure of Clearing Data as in the 
Existing Joint Clearing Member 
Proprietary Clearing Member 
Agreement. Consistently with the 
Existing Joint Clearing Member 
Proprietary Clearing Member 
Agreement, it would also provide that 
neither FICC nor CME guarantees to the 
Eligible BD–FCM that the calculation of 
the margin reduction for a Combined 
Portfolio pursuant to the Third A&R 
Agreement will yield any, or the highest 
possible, margin reduction for the 
Combined Portfolio. The Customer 
Cross-Margining Clearing Member 
Agreement would also, as in the 
Existing Joint Clearing Member 
Proprietary Clearing Member 
Agreement, provide that, without 
limiting any provision of the GSD Rules, 
the rules of CME or any other agreement 
between the Eligible BD–FCM and FICC 
or CME, any transfer by the Eligible BD– 
FCM or any Cross-Margining Customer 
of any rights it may have in the Net Gain 
(or any component thereof) shall be null 
and void and, in any event, subject to 
the prior payment in full of all payment 
and reimbursement obligations under 
the Third A&R Agreement. The 
Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement would contain the 
same representations as the Existing 
Joint Clearing Member Proprietary 
Clearing Member Agreement, except 
those concerning the proprietary nature 
of the positions and Eligible Affiliates. 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement would 
specify that the Eligible BD–FCM may 
terminate the Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement upon two 
business day’s written notice to FICC 
and CME, and that such termination 
shall be effective upon written 
acknowledgement by both FICC and 
CME provided that (i) all positions in 
the Customer Cross-Margining Accounts 
have been closed-out or transferred to 
other accounts in accordance with the 
GSD Rules or the rules of CME, and (ii) 
all Stand-alone Margin Requirement in 
respect of any such transferred positions 
and all obligations of the Eligible BD– 
FCM to the Clearing Organizations in 
respect of the Customer Cross-Margining 
Accounts have been fully satisfied. 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement would also 
specify that either Clearing Organization 
may terminate the Eligible BD–FCM’s 
participation with respect to any 
Customer Cross-Margining Account 
(defined as an ‘‘Affected Customer 
Cross-Margining Account’’) of the 
Eligible BD–FCM at any time upon 
written notice to the other Clearing 
Organization pursuant to the Third A&R 
Agreement and to the Eligible BD–FCM. 
In connection with such termination, 
the Clearing Organizations would be 
permitted to require the Eligible BD– 
FCM to close-out or transfer all 
positions in the Affected Customer 
Cross-Margining Accounts in 
accordance with the GSD Rules or the 
rules of CME, and the Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing Member Agreement 
would thereupon terminate with respect 
to Affected Customer Cross-Margining 
Accounts, provided that the Stand-alone 
Margin Requirement in respect of the 
transferred positions and all obligations 
of the Eligible BD–FCM to the Clearing 
Organizations in respect of the Affected 
Customer Cross-Margining Accounts 
have been fully satisfied. 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement would also 
include the same governing law, choice- 
of-jurisdiction, and execution in 
counterparts provisions as the Existing 
Joint Clearing Member Proprietary 
Clearing Member Agreement. The 
Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement would also provide 
that it would become effective upon the 
later of execution of the Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing Member Agreement, 
or on the receipt of all necessary 
regulatory approvals from the 
Commission and the CFTC. 
H. Customer Agreement 
The Customer Agreement would 
include the terms of the Subordination 
Agreement and acknowledgements 
corresponding to the disclosures 
required by the Proposed Orders.
50
In 
particular, the Customer Agreement 
would require the Cross-Margining 
Customer to acknowledge and agree 
that: 
€it agrees to the terms of the Subordination Agreement, under which 
the Cross-Margining Customer agrees 
that all of its Customer Positions and 
Customer Property (including any 
margin at FICC) (i) will not receive 
customer treatment under the Exchange 
Act or SIPA or be treated as ‘‘customer

a liquidation of Clearing Member, and 
(ii) will be subject to any applicable

require the Cross-Margining Customer to 
move or liquidate Eligible Positions in 
the Customer Cross-Margining Account 
at CME;
57
 
The Customer Agreement would also 
require the Cross-Margining Customer to 
pledge, as security for the Cross- 
Margining Customer’s present and 
future payment and delivery obligations 
in respect of its Customer Positions 
(including, without limitation, any 
obligation of the Cross-Margining 
Customer to reimburse the Eligible BD– 
FCM as a result of the Eligible BD– 
FCM’s performance of such obligations), 
and grant to the Eligible BD–FCM a 
continuing security interest in, lien on 
and right of set-off against its right, 
entitlement, and interest in all of 
positions in each Customer Cross- 
Margining Account, all margin posted 
by the Cross-Margining Customer in 
connection with such positions, and the 
proceeds in respect thereof.
58
The 
Customer Agreement would also require 
the Cross-Margining Customer to agree 
that the Eligible BD–FCM may enter into 
agreements with the Clearing 
Organizations on the Cross-Margining 
Customer’s behalf as set forth in the 
Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement.

(ii) Other Proposed Changes to the GSD 
Rules 
A. Overview 
FICC is proposing to make a number 
of changes to the GSD Rules to 
effectuate the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement. 
First, FICC proposes to create a new 
position Account type, the ‘‘Cross- 
Margining Customer Account,’’ in 
which Customer Positions would be 
recorded. The Cross-Margining 
Customer Account would constitute an 
‘‘Indirect Participants Account.’’ A 
Netting Member that is an Eligible BD– 
FCM and approved participant in the 
Customer Cross-Margining Arrangement 
would be permitted to designate an 
Indirect Participants Account (other 
than a Segregated Indirect Participants 
Account) as a Cross-Margining 
Customer Account.
60
Any such 
designation would constitute a 
representation to FICC by the Netting 
Member that the Netting Member has 
complied with all regulatory 
requirements applicable to it in 
connection with its participation in the 
Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, including the conditions 
in the Proposed Orders, and this 
representation would be deemed 
repeated each time the Netting Member 
deposits Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin. 
Second, FICC proposes to adopt rule 
changes to set forth how FICC would 
calculate, collect, and hold margin for 
positions recorded in a Cross-Margining 
Customer Account. As noted above, 
FICC proposes to collect and hold Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin pursuant to 
substantially similar provisions as apply 
to Segregated Customer Margin, with 
certain modifications to satisfy the 
requirements of the Proposed Orders 
and align with the treatment of futures 
margin. Specifically: 
€Consistent with Segregated Customer Margin and in accordance 
with the Proposed Orders, FICC would 
credit all Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin deposited by a Netting Member 
to a ‘‘securities account’’, as defined in 
the NYUCC,
61
on its books and records 
maintained for that Netting Member for 
the benefit of its Cross-Margining 
Customers (i.e., a Cross-Margining Customer Margin Custody Account). 
The GSD Rules would further provide 
that all cash and securities credited to 
the Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Custody Account shall be treated as 
‘‘financial assets’’ within the meaning of 
Article 8 of the NYUCC, New York shall 
be the ‘‘securities intermediary’s 
jurisdiction’’ for purposes of the NYUCC 
and New York law shall govern all 
issues specified in Article 2(1) of the 
Hague Securities Convention.
62
Such 
provisions are designed to ensure the 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
would not form part of FICC’s estate in 
the event FICC became subject to 
insolvency proceedings. They would 
also facilitate the ability of CME to 
perfect its security interest in the Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin. Such 
perfection would serve to protect CME, 
and in turn both the Cross-Margining 
Customers and the non-participating 
futures customers in the event of a 
Cross-Margining Participant default. It 
would also aim to ensure that the Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin is treated as 
‘‘customer property’’ under Part 190 in 
the event of an Eligible BD–FCM’s 
insolvency, by helping to establish that 
the Cross-Margining Customer Margin is 
held to secure the futures positions of 
customers. 
€In accordance with the Proposed Orders, FICC would hold Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin in (i) an 
account of FICC at a bank insured by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

We note that in this regard, unlike Segregated 
Customer Margin, FICC would be able to use all 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin to satisfy the 
obligations arising from all Customer Positions 
recorded in the same Cross-margining Customer 
Account, even if such Customer Positions are not 
the particular ones of the individual Cross- 
Margining Customer that posted such margin. This 
treatment would be consistent with how futures 
customer margin is generally treated.

See Self-Regulatory Organizations; Fixed Income Clearing Corporation; Order Approving

Cross-Margining Program With New York Portfolio

(‘‘FDIC’’) that is segregated from any 
other account of FICC and used 
exclusively to hold Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin, and (ii) an account at 
the FRBNY that is segregated from any 
other account of FICC and used 
exclusively to hold Segregated Customer 
Margin and Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin. The GSD Rules would provide 
that any such account (other than one at 
the FRBNY) would need to be subject to 
a written notice consistent with the 
Proposed Orders. 
€The same requirements applicable to Segregated Customer Margin with 
respect to the form and composition of 
eligible collateral, the minimum 
amounts of cash and Eligible Clearing 
Fund Treasury Securities, substitution 
and withdrawal, and treatment of excess 
margin would be applicable to Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin, except that 
(i) a Netting Member’s rights or FICC’s 
obligation with respect to any excess 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
would be subject to the Third A&R 
Agreement and the Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing Member Agreement, 
and (ii) FICC would be permitted to 
retain the excess Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin deposited by a Netting 
Member with respect to a Cross- 
Margining Customer when the Netting 
Member has any outstanding payment 
or margin obligation arising from any 
Customer Positions, including those of 
another Cross-Margining Customer. 
With regard to calculation, FICC 
proposes that, as with Segregated 
Customer Margin and in accordance 
with the requirements of the Proposed 
Orders, FICC would calculate the 
margin requirement in respect of each 
Cross-Margining Customer Account (the 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement’’) on a gross (i.e., Cross- Margining Customer-by-Cross- 
Margining Customer) basis, as though 
each Cross-Margining Customer were a 
separate Netting Member. However, 
such margin requirement would be 
subject to any margin reduction 
pursuant to the Third A&R Agreement 
(which, as discussed above, would be 
determined using the same margin 
reduction methodology under 
Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement). 
Third, FICC proposes to provide that 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
would be pledged to FICC to secure all 
obligations of the Netting Member and 
its Cross-Margining Customers arising 
under Customer Positions.
63
 
Fourth, FICC proposes to remove the 
existing Section 10(e) of Rule 3A, which 
currently prohibits Sponsored Members 
from participating in the Cross- 
Margining Arrangement. 
Fifth, FICC proposes to make 
conforming changes to Rule 43, which 
sets out the terms related to Cross- 
Margining Arrangements, so that the 
Rule encompasses the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement. In particular, 
FICC proposes to specify in Rule 43 that 
a Netting Member that is an Eligible 
BD–FCM may become a Cross- 
Margining Participant in connection 
with the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement with the consent of FICC 
and CME. An Eligible BD–FCM would 
become such a Cross-Margining 
Participant and be permitted to establish 
a Cross-Margining Customer Account 
upon acceptance by FICC and CME of 
an executed Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement. FICC 
further proposes to make clear that if 
FICC becomes obligated to make a 
payment to CME pursuant to the cross- 
guaranty under the Third A&R 
Agreement in relation to the obligations 
of a Cross-Margining Customer, both the 
Cross-Margining Customer and the 
relevant Eligible BD–FCM would be 
responsible for the reimbursement 
obligation that is owed to FICC as a 
result. If FICC receives a payment from 
CME pursuant to the Third A&R 
Agreement in connection with the 
Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, FICC would not be 
permitted to apply such payment to any 
obligation other than the obligations of 
Cross-Margining Customers (whether or 
not arising in connection with any 
Eligible Positions). 
Lastly, FICC proposes to remove 
provisions relating to ‘‘Market 
Professional’’ and ‘‘Market Professional 
Agreement for Cross-Margining’’ from 
the GSD Rules. Those provisions were 
adopted in connection with a ‘‘market 
professional’’ cross-margining program 
between FICC and New York Portfolio 
Clearing, LLC.
64
That program—which 
permitted certain ‘‘market professional’’ 
customers of Netting Members to 
participant in cross-margining—is no 
longer active as New York Portfolio 
Clearing, LLC has since become defunct. 
B. Summary of Proposed Rule Changes 
To effectuate the proposed changes 
described above, FICC proposes to make 
the following amendments to its Rules. 
New Defined Terms. FICC would 
revise Rule 1 to add the following new 
defined terms: (1) ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Customer’’, (2) ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Customer Account’’, (3) ‘‘Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin Custody 
Account’’, (4) ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin’’, (5) ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin Requirement’’, and (6) 
‘‘Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement.’’ 
The term ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Customer’’ would mean a Sponsored 
Member or Executing Firm Customer 
whose Transactions are recorded in a 
Cross-Margining Customer Account. 
The term ‘‘Cross-Margining Customer 
Account’’ would mean an Indirect 
Participants Account maintained by 
FICC for a Sponsoring Member or an 
Agent Clearing Member that has been 
designated pursuant to Rule 2B for 
purposes of recording Transactions of 
Cross-Margining Customers. 
The term ‘‘Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin Custody Account’’ would mean 
a securities account within the meaning 
of the NYUCC maintained by FICC, in 
its capacity as securities intermediary as 
such term is used in the NYUCC, for an 
Agent Clearing Member or Sponsoring 
Member for the benefit of such 
Member’s Cross-Margining Customers. 
The term ‘‘Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin’’ would mean all securities and 
funds deposited by a Sponsoring 
Member or an Agent Clearing Member 
with FICC to satisfy its Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin Requirement. 
The term ‘‘Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin Requirement’’ would mean the 
amount of cash or Eligible Clearing 
Fund Securities that an Agent Clearing 
Member or Sponsoring Member is 
required to deposit with FICC to support 
the obligations arising from 
Transactions recorded in its Cross- 
Margining Customer Accounts. 
Specifically, a Netting Member’s Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement would be the amount of 
the item listed in Section 2(a)(vii) of 
Rule 4 (as described below). This 
definition would specify that references 
to the Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement ‘‘for’’ or ‘‘with respect to’’ 
a particular Cross-Margining Customer 
Account or Cross-Margining Customer 
(or similar language) would mean the 
portion of a Netting Member’s Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin

or Cross-Margining Customer. 
The term ‘‘Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement’’ would mean a Cross- 
Margining Arrangement pursuant to 
which a Cross-Margining Participant, at 
the discretion of FICC and in 
accordance with the provisions of Rule 
43, may elect to have any of its Cross- 
Margining Customers’ margin 
requirement in respect of Eligible 
Positions at FICC and such Cross- 
Margining Customer’s margin 
requirements in respect of Eligible 
Positions at a clearing organization for 
a board of trade designated as a contract 
market under Section 5 of the CEA that 
has entered into a Cross-Margining 
Agreement with FICC (an ‘‘FCO’’) 
calculated by taking into consideration 
the net risk of such Eligible Positions at 
each of the clearing organizations. 
Revisions to Defined Terms. In 
addition, FICC would make conforming 
revisions to the following defined terms 
in Rule 1: (1) ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Affiliate,’’ (2) ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Agreement’’ (3) ‘‘Current Net Settlement 
Positions,’’ (4) ‘‘Indirect Participants 
Account,’’ and (5) ‘‘Type of Account’’ 
and ‘‘Type.’’ 
FICC proposes to amend the 
definition to ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Affiliate’’ to remove existing prong (ii), 
which relates to the ‘‘market 
professional’’ cross-margining program. 
FICC proposes to amend the 
definition to ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Agreement’’ to encompass the Customer 
Cross-Margining Arrangement by 
specifying that the applicable Cross- 
Margining Participant may have any of 
its Cross-Margining Customers’ margin 
requirement in respect of Eligible 
Positions at FICC and such Cross- 
Margining Customer’s margin 
requirements in respect of Eligible 
Positions at a relevant FCO calculated 
by taking into consideration the net risk 
of such Eligible Positions at each of the 
clearing organizations. FICC also 
proposes to remove the last sentence of 
this definition, which relates to the 
‘‘market professional’’ cross-margining 
program. 
FICC proposes to make conforming 
edits to the definition of ‘‘Current Net 
Settlement Positions’’ to add references 
to ‘‘Cross-Margining Customer,’’ ‘‘Cross- 
Margining Customer Account,’’ and 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement’’ after each reference to 
‘‘Segregated Indirect Participant,’’ 
‘‘Segregated Indirect Participants 
Account,’’ and ‘‘Segregated Customer 
Margin Requirement,’’ respectively. 
FICC proposes to amend the 
definitions of ‘‘Indirect Participants 
Account,’’ ‘‘Type of Account’’ and 
‘‘Type’’ to include a Cross-Margining 
Customer Account. 
Removal of defined terms. FICC 
proposes to remove the following 
defined terms from Rule 1: (1) ‘‘Market 
Professional’’ and (2) ‘‘Market 
Professional Agreement for Cross- 
Margining.’’ 
Establishment of Cross-Margining 
Customer Accounts. FICC proposes to 
amend Section 3 of Rule 2B to provide 
that a Cross-Margining Customer 
Account may not be designated as a 
Segregated Indirect Participants 
Account. 
In addition, FICC proposes to add a 
new Section 3a of Rule 2B to provide 
that (i) a Netting Member that is an 
Eligible BD–FCM and has been 
approved to become a Cross-Margining 
Participant in a Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement pursuant to a 
Cross-Margining Agreement may 
designate any of its Indirect Participants 
Accounts (other than a Segregated 
Indirect Participants Account) as a 
Cross-Margining Customer Account; (ii) 
any such designation of an Account 
shall constitute a representation to FICC 
by the Netting Member that the Netting 
Member has complied with all 
regulatory requirements applicable to it 
in connection with its participation in 
the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, including the conditions 
in the Proposed Orders; and (iii) the 
Netting Member shall be deemed to 
repeat this representation each time it 
deposits Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin. 
Treatment of Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin. FICC proposes to 
make the following changes in relation 
to FICC’s calculation, collection, and 
holding of Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin: 
FICC proposes to amend Section 1a of 
Rule 4 to make clear that FICC’s account 
at the FRBNY that is currently used to 
hold Segregated Customer Margin 
would also hold Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin. 
FICC proposes to renumber current 
Section 1b of Rule 4 to Section 1c and 
add a new Section 1b. The new Section 
1b would provide that: 
€Each Netting Member shall deposit Cross-Margining Customer Margin with 
FICC in an amount equal to its Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement, which requirement shall 
be determined in accordance with Rule 
4 and the Margin Component Schedule. 
The timing of the satisfaction of the 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement shall be determined in 
accordance with the provisions of 
Section 9 of Rule 4. 
€FICC shall establish and maintain on its books and records a Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin Custody 
Account to which all Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin deposited with FICC 
shall be credited. The Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin credited to a Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin Custody 
Account shall be used exclusively to 
secure the present and future payment 
and reimbursement obligations of the 
Netting Member and its Cross-Margining 
Customers in relation to Eligible 
Positions of the Netting Member’s Cross- 
Margining Customers at FICC and CME. 
€All assets credited to each Cross- Margining Customer Margin Custody 
Account shall be treated as ‘‘financial 
assets’’ within the meaning of Article 8 
of the NYUCC. New York is the 
‘‘securities intermediary’s jurisdiction’’ 
for purposes of the NYUCC and New 
York law shall govern all issues 
specified in Article 2(1) of the Hague 
Securities Convention. 
€FICC shall hold all Cross-Margining Customer Margin in an account of FICC 
at an FDIC-insured bank within the 
meaning of the Exchange Act that is a 
qualified custodian under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940, as 
amended, or at the FRBNY. Any account 
at an FDIC-insured bank shall be 
segregated from any other account of 
FICC and shall be used exclusively to 
hold Cross-Margining Customer Margin, 
and shall be subject to a written notice 
of the bank provided to and retained by 
FICC consistent with the Proposed 
Orders. The account at the FRBNY shall 
be segregated from any other account of 
FICC and shall be used exclusively to 
hold Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
and Segregated Customer Margin (the 
account at the FRBNY would not be 
subject to a written notice). 
FICC proposes to amend current 
Section 1b (to be renumbered as Section 
1c) of Rule 4 to (i) add references to 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Accounts’’ 
after references to ‘‘Segregated Indirect 
Participants Accounts’’ in current 
Section 1b(a), and (ii) add a new 
sentence at the end of current Section 
1b(b) to provide that FICC would 
calculate the Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin Requirement for a Cross- 
Margining Customer Account as the 
sum of the requirements applicable to 
each Cross-Margining Customer whose 
Transactions are recorded in such 
Account, as though each such Cross- 
Margining Customer were a separate 
Netting Member with a single Margin 
Portfolio consisting of such 
Transactions, in accordance with the 
Margin Component Schedule. 
FICC proposes to amend Section 2 of 
Rule 4 by (i) adding references to

Requirement’’ after references to 
‘‘Segregated Customer Margin 
Requirement’’ in the title of Section 2 
and Section 2(a), and (ii) adding a new 
clause (vii) of Section 2(a) to specify 
that the Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin Requirement would be an 
amount calculated with respect to the 
Netting Member’s Cross-Margining 
Customer Accounts. 
FICC proposes to add a new Section 
2c of Rule 4 entitled ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin Requirement’’ to 
provide that (i) each Netting Member 
shall deposit any Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin with FICC by the 
Required Fund Deposit Deadline 
through a separate Deposit ID 
established by the Netting Member for 
each Cross-Margining Customer 
Account, and (ii) FICC shall report the 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirements to each Netting Member 
twice daily in a Report which shall 
specify the Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin Requirement for each Cross- 
Margining Customer Account. 
FICC proposes to add a new Section 
3(d) of Rule 4 and insert it before the 
last sentence of Section 3. The new 
Section 3(d) would provide that each 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement for a particular Cross- 
Margining Customer Account would be 
subject to the requirements that (i) a 
minimum of 40 percent of the Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement for such Account shall be 
satisfied with cash and/or Eligible 
Clearing Fund Treasury Securities, and 
(ii) a minimum of the product of $1 
million and the number of Cross- 
Margining Customers whose 
Transactions are recorded in such Cross- 
Margining Account must be made and 
maintained in cash. In addition, FICC 
proposes to amend the last sentence of 
Section 3 by adding a reference to 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement’’ after the reference to 
‘‘Segregated Indirect Participants 
Requirement.’’ 
FICC proposes to amend Section 3a of 
Rule 4 to add a reference to ‘‘Cross- 
Margining Customers’’ after the 
reference to ‘‘Segregated Indirect 
Participants.’’ FICC also proposes to 
amend Section 3b of Rule 4 to add a 
reference to ‘‘Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin Custody Account’’ after the 
reference to ‘‘Segregated Customer 
Margin Custody Account.’’ 
FICC proposes to amend Sections 3a, 
3b, and 9 of Rule 4 to add references to 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin,’’ 
after each reference to ‘‘Segregated 
Customer Margin.’’ FICC also proposes 
to amend Sections 3b and 9 of Rule 4 
to add references to ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin Requirement,’’ after 
each reference to ‘‘Segregated Customer 
Margin Requirement.’’ 
FICC proposes to add a new Section 
4(c) of Rule 4 to provide that (i) as 
security for any and all obligations and 
liabilities of a Netting Member and any 
of its Cross-Margining Customers to 
FICC arising out of or in connection 
with any Cross-Margining Customer 
Accounts of such Netting Member or 
Transactions recorded therein, each 
such Netting Member on behalf of itself 
and its Cross-Margining Customers 
grants to FICC a first priority perfected 
security interest in its right, title and 
interest in and to all Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin, each Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin Custody Account, and 
all distributions thereon and proceeds 
thereof, and (ii) FICC shall be entitled to 
exercise the rights of a pledgee under 
common law and a secured party under 
Articles 8 and 9 of the NYUCC with 
respect to such assets. 
FICC proposes to amend Section 5 of 
Rule 4 by (i) adding a reference to 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin’’ 
after the reference to ‘‘Segregated 
Customer Margin’’ in the title of Section 
5, and (ii) adding a new paragraph at the 
end of Section 5 to provide that FICC 
shall only use Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin deposited by a Netting 
Member to (A) secure the Transactions 
of Cross-Margining Customers of such 
Netting Member recorded in any Cross- 
Margining Customer Account and 
satisfy payment and delivery obligations 
owing to FICC (including liquidating or 
otherwise using such Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin to obtain relevant cash 
or securities) in connection with a 
default in respect of such Transactions; 
and (B) for investment in U.S. Treasury 
securities with a maturity of one year or 
less. 
FICC proposes to amend Section 10 of 
Rule 4 by (i) adding a reference to 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin’’ 
after the reference to ‘‘Segregated 
Customer Margin’’ in the title of Section 
10, (ii) amending the first paragraph of 
Section 10 to require FICC to separately 
determine whether the amount of Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin supporting 
a Cross-Margining Customer’s 
Transactions is in excess of the Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement for such Cross-Margining 
Customer (‘‘Excess Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin’’), and (iii) adding a 
new Section 10(c) to provide that upon 
a Member’s request, and in accordance 
with such procedures as FICC may set 
forth from time to time, the Corporation 
shall return to the Member its Excess 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin, 
subject to the minimum amount of cash 
or Eligible Clearing Fund Securities 
required to be maintained pursuant to 
the GSD Rules (valued at their collateral 
value on the day of such withdrawal) 
and the terms of the Third A&R 
Agreement and Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing Member Agreement, 
as the Member requests, provided that, 
subject to the Third A&R Agreement and 
the Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement, and except to the 
extent required by applicable law or 
authorized by the Commission, FICC 
shall not retain Excess Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin due to any obligations 
of the Member unrelated to a Cross- 
Margining Customer Account of such 
Member. Section 10(c) of Rule 4 would 
further provide that FICC may, at its 
discretion, retain some or all of the 
Excess Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin if the Member has an 
outstanding payment or margin 
obligation to the Corporation with 
respect to the Transactions of any Cross- 
Margining Customer. 
FICC proposes to amend the Margin 
Component Schedule to set out how 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirements would be determined. 
Specifically, FICC proposes to insert a 
new paragraph at the end of Section 1 
to provide that (i) on each Business Day, 
each Netting Member for which FICC 
maintains a Cross-Margining Customer 
Account shall be required to deposit 
with FICC Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin equal to the sum of all Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin 
Requirements for all such Accounts, (ii) 
each Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement shall equal the sum of the 
amounts calculated pursuant to Section 
3a of the Margin Component Schedule 
for each Cross-Margining Customer 
whose Transactions are recorded in the 
relevant Cross-Margining Customer 
Account, and (iii) each such calculation 
shall be performed twice daily or on a 
more frequent basis if FICC deems it 
appropriate pursuant to the Margin 
Component Schedule and subject to the 
provisions of Rule 4. Further, FICC 
proposes to add a new Section 3a to the 
Margin Component Schedule titled 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement Calculations’’ to set out 
how specifically such requirement 
would be calculated, which would be 
substantially identical to how 
Segregated Customer Margin 
Requirement is calculated as set out in 
Section 3 of the Margin Component 
Schedule. Finally, FICC proposes to 
amend Section 5 to add references to 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer,’’ ‘‘Cross- 
Margining Customer Account,’’ and

Description of the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement. FICC proposes 
to amend Rule 43 to explicitly describe 
the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement as follows: 
FICC proposes to add a new Section 
2(c) of Rule 43 to provide that (i) a 
Netting Member that is an Eligible BD– 
FCM may become a Cross-Margining 
Participant in connection with the 
Customer Cross-Margining Arrangement 
with the consent of FICC and CME, and 
(ii) an Eligible BD–FCM that would 
become such a Cross-Margining 
Participant shall be permitted to 
establish a Cross-Margining Customer 
Account upon acceptance by FICC and 
CME of an executed Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing MSD Member 
Agreement. 
FICC proposes to amend Section 3 of 
Rule 43 to provide that, if FICC becomes 
obligated to make a payment to CME 
pursuant to the cross-guaranty under the 
Third A&R Agreement in relation to the 
obligations of a Cross-Margining 
Participant, its Cross-Margining 
Affiliate, or its Cross-Margining 
Customer, the Cross-Margining 
Participant (and, if FICC becomes 
obligated to make such a payment in 
respect of the obligations of a Cross- 
Margining Customer, the Cross- 
Margining Customer) shall thereupon 
immediately be obligated, whether or 
not FICC has then made payment to 
CME, to pay to FICC the amount of the 
reimbursement obligation that is owed 
to FICC as a result. 
FICC proposes to add a new sentence 
at the end of Section 5 of Rule 43 to 
provide that, if FICC receives a payment 
from CME pursuant to the Third A&R 
Agreement in connection with the 
Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, FICC would not be 
permitted to apply such payment to any 
obligation other than the obligations of 
Cross-Margining Customers (whether or 
not arising in connection with any 
Eligible Positions). 
Conforming and clarifying Changes. 
FICC proposes to make the following 
conforming or clarifying changes: 
FICC proposes to amend Section 
4(b)(i) of Rule 2A to make clear that an 
applicant to become a Netting Member 
must have sufficient financial ability to 
make anticipated required deposits to 
not only Clearing Fund and Segregated 
Customer Margin, but also any Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin. 
FICC proposes to remove Section 
10(e) of Rule 3A to remove the current 
prohibition of Sponsored Members from 
participating in any Cross-Margining 
Arrangements, and accordingly 
renumber current Section 10(f) of Rule 
3A to Section 10(e). 
FICC proposes to remove (i) the 
language in parentheticals in the first 
sentence of Section 1 of Rule 13, (ii) the 
second sentence in Section 2(b) of Rule 
22A, and (iii) the portions of Sections 
2(a) and 2(b) of Rule 43 that are crossed 
out in Exhibit 5, because those 
provisions relate to the ‘‘market 
professional’’ cross-margining program, 
which is no longer active and would not 
be used if the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement becomes available. 
Implementation Timeframe 
The proposed Third A&R Agreement 
would not become effective and replace 
the Second A&R Agreement until the 
latest of (i) the date on which all 
necessary regulatory approvals of the 
proposed Third A&R Agreement have 
been received by FICC and CME and (ii) 
a date agreed by FICC and CME.
65
FICC 
would issue an important notice to GSD 
Members providing the specific 
operative date at least two weeks prior 
to such date. 
Expected Effect on Management of Risk 
FICC believes that the proposed rule 
changes to extend the availability of the 
Cross-Margining Arrangement to 
positions cleared and carried for Cross- 
Margining Customers by an Eligible BD– 
FCM would enhance FICC’s and its 
Netting Members’ risk management. 
First, the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement would produce margin 
levels commensurate with the risks and 
particular attributes of the Eligible 
Positions. This is because FICC would 
first calculate initial margin 
requirements for Customer Positions 
using the same methodology as applies 
to Segregated Indirect Participant 
positions and then determine possible 
margin reductions using the same 
methodology as is used under the 
Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, with each Cross- 
Margining Customer treated effectively 
as an independent Netting Member. The 
Commission recently approved each of 
these methodologies in connection with 
other FICC rule filings, confirming in 
particular that they satisfied the 
requirements of Rule 17ad–22(e)(6) 
under the Exchange Act.
66
As with the 
margin methodology applicable to 
Segregated Indirect Participants, FICC 
would calculate margin requirements on 
a gross (i.e., Cross-Margining Customer- by-Cross-Margining Customer) basis and 
would not net Eligible Positions across 
separate Cross-Margining Customers. 
With respect to such gross calculation 
methodology in the context of 
Segregated Indirect Participants, the 
Commission noted in the approval order 
covering that rule filing that it would 
‘‘better isolate the risk profiles of 
individual indirect participants from 
Netting Members, which should help 
FICC better understand and monitor 
each individual participant’s risk 
exposures.’’
67
 
Second, by applying the same margin 
reduction methodology that is utilized 
under the Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, FICC would continue to 
recognize risk offsets that arise from 
Eligible Positions cleared at CME. This 
would help ensure that the margin 
requirements are not overstated or 
understated and are calibrated based on 
the particular risk the Cross-Margining 
Customer’s portfolio presents to FICC 
and CME. This would provide FICC 
with robust protection against a default, 
and incentivize Cross-Margining 
Customers to maintain portfolios that 
present lower risk. Such lower risk 
portfolios would, in turn, reduce the 
risk of a default in the first place. 
Third, the proposed changes would 
require Eligible BD–FCMs to collect 
from Cross-Margining Customers the 
initial margin calculated for the 
Customer Positions. The collateral 
posted by the Cross-Margining 
Customers would serve to reduce the 
exposure of an Eligible BD–FCM to its 
Cross-Margining Customers and thus 
reduce the risk of a default by the 
Eligible BD–FCM to FICC. 
Finally, the proposed rule changes 
would require an Eligible BD–FCM to 
enter into a Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement with FICC 
and CME, under which the Eligible BD– 
FCM would pledge to FICC, on behalf of 
itself and each Cross-Margining 
Customer, the positions and margin 
subject to the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement at both FICC and CME. 
This pledge, coupled with the cross- 
guaranty between FICC and CME set 
forth in the Third A&R Agreement, 
would help to ensure that FICC is able 
to look to the full portfolio of Customer 
Positions and associated margin at FICC

and CME in order to satisfy any 
obligations arising under the Customer 
Positions. 
Consistency With Section 805 of the 
Clearing Supervision Act 
FICC believes the proposed rule 
changes are consistent with Title VIII of 
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act entitled the 
Payment, Clearing Supervision Act.
68
 
Specifically, FICC believes the proposed 
rule changes are consistent with the risk 
management objectives and principles 
of Section 805 of the Clearing 
Supervision Act.
69
 
(i) Consistency With Section 805(b) of 
the Clearing Supervision Act 
Section 805(b) of the Clearing 
Supervision Act provides that ‘‘[t]he 
objectives and principles for the risk 
management standards prescribed under 
subsection (a) shall be to (1) promote 
robust risk management; (2) promote 
safety and soundness; (3) reduce 
systemic risks; and (4) support the 
stability of the broader financial 
system.’’
70
The proposed rule changes 
would do this by providing that FICC 
would calculate the margin requirement 
applicable to Customer Positions on a 
gross Cross-Margining Customer-by- 
Cross-Margining Customer basis, with 
margin reductions for Eligible Positions 
in futures at CME that present offsetting 
risk. This would ensure that margin 
requirements are calibrated based on the 
risk of each Cross-Margining Customer’s 
portfolio, which in turn would promote 
robust risk management by Cross- 
Margining Customers and reduce the 
risk of a default of a Cross-Margining 
Customer or its Eligible BD–FCM. 
The reduced margin requirements 
which would result from the proposed 
rule changes would also incentivize 
Cross-Margining Customers to post 
initial margin in respect of their Eligible 
Positions, rather than rely on their 
Eligible BD–FCM to do so. Currently, 
FICC understands that it is common 
practice for Sponsoring Members and 
Agent Clearing Members to use their 
own assets to satisfy the FICC initial 
margin requirements associated with 
FICC-cleared positions that Eligible BD– 
FCMs carry for their customers. This 
increases the costs to Sponsoring 
Members and Agent Clearing Members 
of offering customer clearing services 
and limits their capacity to do so. As a 
result of the proposed rule changes, a 
Cross-Margining Customer’s Eligible 
Positions at FICC would be eligible for 
a possible margin reduction with 
respect to offsetting futures positions at 
CME if the Cross-Margining Customer 
posts the initial margin instead of its 
Eligible BD–FCM doing so. It would 
thus incentivize indirect participants to 
post margin, which would likely result 
in an associated cost reduction from 
their Eligible BD–FCMs. Such posting 
would, in turn, serve to reduce Eligible 
BD–FCMs’ risk to their Cross-Margining 
Customers. 
The reduced costs to Eligible BD– 
FCMs would also enhance their ability 
to provide access to FICC’s clearance 
and settlement services to a greater 
number of indirect participants, and 
thereby increase the diversity and scope 
of market participants able to utilize 
FICC’s U.S. Treasury clearing services. 
These services can reduce systemic risk 
through FICC’s multilateral netting, 
support the stability of the financial 
system through FICC’s trade guaranty 
and centralized default management, 
and promote safety and soundness 
through FICC’s counterparty risk 
management.
71
 
The proposed rule changes would 
also allow Cross-Margining Customers 
to benefit from the margin offsets that 
are currently only available to Cross- 
Margining Participants and their 
Eligible Affiliates under the Proprietary 
Cross-Margining Arrangement, thereby 
facilitating increased access to clearing 
for indirect participants and promoting 
the maintenance of more balanced 
portfolios that present lower risk. The 
proposed rule changes would 
consequently serve to enhance liquidity 
in, and otherwise promote the resilience 
and robustness of, the U.S. Treasury 
market. 
As a result, FICC believes the 
proposed rule changes will advance 
Section 805(b)’s objectives and 
principles of promoting robust risk 
management, promoting safety and 
soundness, reducing systemic risks, and 
supporting the stability of the broader 
financial system. 
(ii) Consistency with Section 805(a)(2) 
of the Clearing Supervision Act 
Section 805(a)(2) of the Clearing 
Supervision Act authorizes the 
Commission to prescribe risk 
management standards for the payment, 
clearing, and settlement activities of 
designated clearing entities, like FICC.
72
 
Accordingly, the Commission has 
adopted risk management standards 
under this section and under Section 
17A of the Exchange Act.
73
These 
standards require registered clearing 
agencies to establish, implement, 
maintain, and enforce written policies 
and procedures that are reasonably 
designed to meet certain minimum 
requirements for their operations and 
risk management practices on an 
ongoing basis.
74
FICC believes that the 
proposed rule changes are consistent 
with Rules 17ad–22(e)(4)(i), (e)(6)(i), 
and (e)(18)(iv)(C), each promulgated 
under the Exchange Act.
75
 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(4)(i) under the 
Exchange Act requires that a covered 
clearing agency establish, implement, 
maintain, and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to 
effectively identify, measure, monitor, 
and manage its credit exposures to 
participants and those arising from its 
payment, clearing, and settlement 
processes by maintaining sufficient 
financial resources to cover its credit 
exposure to each participant fully with 
a high degree of confidence.
76
FICC 
believes that the proposed rule changes 
would ensure that FICC continues to 
effectively measure and manage its 
credit exposure to participants by 
maintaining sufficient financial 
resources to cover its exposure thereto 
with a high degree of confidence. This 
is because, under the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement, FICC would 
calculate the margin requirement 
applicable to Customer Positions on a 
gross Cross-Margining Customer-by- 
Cross-Margining Customer basis, with 
margin reductions for offsetting futures 
positions at CME calculated using a 
cross-margin methodology that the 
Commission recently approved.
77
As 
described above, the Commission found 
that similar customer-by-customer gross 
margining arrangements adopted by 
FICC for Segregated Indirect 
Participants would help FICC to better 
understand and monitor the risk 
exposures of individual participants.
78
 
In addition, the proposed rule 
changes would require each Eligible 
BD–FCM for whom FICC maintains one 
or more Cross-Margining Customer 
Account(s) to deposit to FICC cash or 
eligible securities to meet the Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin

Requirement that is calibrated to the 
risks of each Cross-Margining 
Customer’s portfolio. Such Eligible BD– 
FCM would also be required to enter 
into a Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement with FICC 
and CME, pursuant to which the 
Eligible BD–FCM would pledge to FICC, 
on behalf of itself and each Cross- 
Margining Customer, the positions and 
margin subject to the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement at both FICC 
and CME. This pledge, along with the 
cross-guaranty between FICC and CME 
set forth in the Third A&R Agreement, 
would allow FICC and CME to look to 
the full portfolio of Customer Positions 
and associated margin at FICC and CME 
in order to satisfy any obligations 
arising under Customer Positions. 
Accordingly, the proposed rule changes 
would ensure that FICC will have 
sufficient resources to rely on to cover 
cross-margining exposures under the 
Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, and would ensure 
compliance with Rule 17ad–22(e)(4)(i). 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(6)(i) under the 
Exchange Act requires that a covered 
clearing agency establish, implement, 
maintain, and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to 
cover its credit exposures to its 
participants by establishing a risk-based 
margin system that, at a minimum, 
considers, and produces margin levels 
commensurate with, the risks and 
particular attributes of each relevant 
product, portfolio, and market, and, if 
the covered clearing agency provides 
central counterparty services for U.S. 
Treasury securities, calculates, collects, 
and holds margin amounts from a direct 
participant for its proprietary positions 
in Treasury securities separately and 
independently from margin calculated 
and collected from that direct 
participant in connection with U.S. 
Treasury securities transactions by an 
indirect participant that relies on the 
services provided by the direct 
participant to access the covered 
clearing agency’s payment, clearing, or 
settlement facilities.
79
 
FICC believes that the proposed rule 
changes would satisfy these 
requirements. The Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement would produce 
margin levels commensurate with the 
risks and particular attributes of the 
Eligible Positions, as FICC would 
calculate initial margin requirements for 
each Cross-Margining Customer using 
the same methodology that FICC applies 
to Segregated Indirect Participants, with 
potential margin offsets for Customer 
Positions calculated using the same 
methodology as is used under the 
Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement. The Commission recently 
confirmed that such methodologies 
satisfied the requirements of Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(6) in connection with other FICC 
rule filings.
80
 
In addition, the proposed rule 
changes would provide that margin 
applicable to Customer Positions would 
be calculated separately and 
independently of the margin for any 
positions recorded in any Proprietary 
Account of a Cross-Margining 
Participant. The proposed rule changes 
would also provide for Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin to be collected and 
held in substantially a similar manner to 
Segregated Customer Margin. The 
Commission recently approved FICC’s 
arrangements for Segregated Customer 
Margin, finding in particular that they 
‘‘should ensure that a Netting Member’s 
proprietary transactions are not netted 
with indirect participant transactions 
for margin calculations and that margin 
for indirect participant transactions is 
collected and held separately and 
independently from margin for a Netting 
Member’s proprietary transactions.’’
81
 
Accordingly, the proposed rule changes 
would ensure compliance with Rule 
17ad–22(e)(6)(i). 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(18)(iv)(C) under the 
Exchange Act requires, among other 
things, that a covered clearing agency 
that provides central counterparty 
services for transactions in U.S. 
Treasury securities ensure that it has 
appropriate means to facilitate access to 
clearance and settlement services of all 
eligible secondary market transactions 
in U.S. Treasury securities, including 
those of indirect participants.
82
The 
proposed rule changes would expand 
the Cross-Margining Arrangement, 
which currently is available for 
proprietary positions of Cross-Margining 
Participants and those of their Eligible 
Affiliates, to Customer Positions. This 
expansion would serve to facilitate 
greater access to clearing for indirect 
participants of FICC by more effectively 
aligning the margin requirements 
applicable to such participants’ 
positions with the overall risk those 
positions present. 
Furthermore, by creating an incentive 
for Cross-Margining Customers to post 
margin for their positions, the proposed 
rule changes would serve to reduce the 
need for Eligible BD–FCMs to use their 
own liquidity resources to cover such 
margin obligations. As a result, it would 
reduce the costs and increase the 
capacity of Eligible BD–FCMs to provide 
clearing services, which would in turn 
allow Eligible BD–FCMs to increase the 
volume of transactions they submit to 
FICC for clearing. Moreover, by creating 
significant cost savings and efficiencies 
for Cross-Margining Customers that 
maintain offsetting futures positions at 
CME, the proposed rule changes would 
create an incentive for Eligible BD– 
FCMs to offer done-away clearing 
services. For Eligible BD–FCMs, clearing 
U.S. Treasury securities positions 
entered into by a customer with other 
trading counterparties would provide a 
potential opportunity to reduce overall 
financial risk without the cost of 
funding the customer’s margin 
obligations at FICC. Therefore, the 
proposed rule changes would facilitate 
enhanced access to clearance and 
settlement services of all eligible 
secondary market transactions in U.S. 
Treasury securities, including those of 
indirect participants.
83
 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the Advance 
Notice 
The proposed change may be 
implemented if the Commission does 
not object to the proposed change 
within 60 days of the later of (i) the date 
that the proposed change was filed with 
the Commission or (ii) the date that any 
additional information requested by the 
Commission is received. The clearing 
agency shall not implement the 
proposed change if the Commission has 
any objection to the proposed change. 
The Commission may extend the 
period for review by an additional 60 
days if the proposed change raises novel 
or complex issues, subject to the 
Commission providing the clearing 
agency with prompt written notice of 
the extension. A proposed change may 
be implemented in less than 60 days 
from the date the advance notice is 
filed, or the date further information 
requested by the Commission is 
received, if the Commission notifies the 
clearing agency in writing that it does 
not object to the proposed change and 
authorizes the clearing agency to 
implement the proposed change on an 
earlier date, subject to any conditions 
imposed by the Commission. 
The clearing agency shall post notice 
on its website of proposed changes that 
are implemented. 
The proposal shall not take effect 
until all regulatory actions required 
with respect to the proposal are 
completed.

at the principal office of FICC and on 
DTCC’s website (www.dtcc.com/legal/ 
sec-rule-filings). Do not include 
personal identifiable information in 
submissions; you should submit only 
information that you wish to make 
available publicly. We may redact in 
part or withhold entirely from 
publication submitted material that is 
obscene or subject to copyright 
protection. All submissions should refer 
to File Number SR–FICC–2025–801 and 
should be submitted on or before 
January 20, 2026. 
V. Date of Timing for Commission 
Action 
Section 806(e)(1)(G) of the Clearing 
Supervision Act provides that FICC may 
implement the changes if it has not 
received an objection to the proposed 
changes within 60 days of the later of (i) 
the date that the Commission receives 
the Advance Notice or (ii) the date that 
any additional information requested by 
the Commission is received,
84
unless 
extended as described below. 
Pursuant to Section 806(e)(1)(H) of the 
Clearing Supervision Act, the 
Commission may extend the review 
period of an advance notice for an 
additional 60 days, if the changes 
proposed in the advance notice raise 
novel or complex issues, subject to the 
Commission providing the clearing 
agency with prompt written notice of 
the extension.
85
 
Here, as the Commission has not 
requested any additional information, 
the date that is 60 days after FICC filed 
the Advance Notice with the 
Commission is February 10, 2026. 
However, the Commission finds that the 
changes proposed in the Advance 
Notice raise novel and complex issues. 
The Commission finds the issues novel 
because FICC proposes to extend the 
availability of its Cross-Margining 
Arrangement with CME to customers of 
an Eligible BD–FCM to allow Cross- 
Margining Customers to benefit from the 
margin reductions that are currently 
only available to Cross-Margining 
Participants and their Eligible Affiliates. 
The Commission also finds the issues 
raised by the Advance Notice complex 
because the proposed changes to the 
Cross-Margining Agreement between 
FICC and CME and the GSD Rules entail 
new provisions including criteria and 
requirements for participation in the 
Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, as well as consistency 
with the Petitions. Therefore, the 
Commission finds it appropriate to 
extend the review period of the 
Advance Notice for an additional 60 
days under Section 806(e)(1)(H) of the 
Clearing Supervision Act.
86
 
Accordingly, the Commission, 
pursuant to Section 806(e)(1)(H) of the 
Clearing Supervision Act,
87
extends the 
review period for an additional 60 days 
so that the Commission shall have until 
April 11, 2026, to issue an objection or 
non-objection to Advance Notice SR– 
FICC–2025–801. 
For the Commission, by the Division of 
Trading and Markets, pursuant to delegated 
authority.

A ‘‘legacy’’ port refers to a port that was 
subscribed to by a Phlx member or member 
organization prior to the technology migration and 
connects to the existing technology platform. 
5
A ‘‘new’’ port refers to a port acquired for the 
Phlx technology migration and would connect to 
the new technology migration. 
6
‘‘Specialized Quote Feed’’ or ‘‘SQF’’ is an 
interface that allows Lead Market Makers, 
Streaming Quote Traders (‘‘SQTs’’) and Remote 
Streaming Quote Traders (‘‘RSQTs’’) to connect, 
send, and receive messages related to quotes, 
Immediate-or-Cancel Orders, and auction responses 
into and from the Exchange. Features include the 
following: (1) options symbol directory messages 
(e.g., underlying and complex instruments); (2) system event messages (e.g., start of trading hours messages and start of opening); (3) trading action 
messages (e.g., halts and resumes); (4) execution messages; (5) quote messages; (6) Immediate-or- 
Cancel Order messages; (7) risk protection triggers 
and purge notifications; (8) opening imbalance 
messages; (9) auction notifications; and (10) auction 
responses. The SQF Purge Interface only receives 
and notifies of purge requests from the Lead Market 
Maker, SQT or RSQT. Lead Market Makers, SQTs 
and RSQTs may only enter interest into SQF in 
their assigned options series. Immediate-or-Cancel 
Orders entered into SQF are not subject to the Order 
Price Protection, the Market Order Spread 
Protection, or Size Limitation in Options 3, Section 
15(a)(1), (a)(2) and (b)(2), respectively. See Options 3, Section 7(a)(i)(B). 
7
An SQF Purge Interface only receives and 
notifies of purge request from the Market Maker. 
8
Clearing Trade Interface (‘‘CTI’’) is a real-time 
clearing trade update message that is sent to a 
member after an execution has occurred and 
contains trade details specific to that member. The 
information includes, among other things, the 
following: (i) The Clearing Member Trade 
Agreement or ‘‘CMTA’’ or ‘‘OCC’’ number; (ii) 
Exchange badge or house number; (iii) the Exchange 
internal firm identifier; (iv) an indicator which will 
distinguish electronic and non-electronically 
delivered orders; (v) liquidity indicators and 
transaction type for billing purposes; and (vi) 
capacity. See Options 3, Section 23(b)(1). 9
The duplicate new SQF Ports, SQF Purge Ports, 
and CTI Ports and duplicate mnemonics were 
offered at no cost will allow members and member 
organizations time to test ports to the new 
environment as well as provide continuous 
connection to the Exchange’s match engine during 
the migration. During the Transition Period, 
members and member organizations will be 
required to utilize their new ports on the new 
platform for symbols that have migrated to the new 
platform, while continuing to leverage legacy ports 
for symbols that have not yet migrated to the new 
platform. The technology migration does not 
require Phlx members and member organizations to 
acquire additional ports or any new ports that are 
being offered, rather the technology migration 
requires a new port to connect to the new 
environment. Phlx assessed port fees for December 
2025 as of December 1, 2025. 
10
See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 103593 (July 30, 2025), 90 FR 36479 (August 4, 
2025) (SR–Phlx–2025–32) (Notice of Filing and 
Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change 
To Amend Options 7, Section 9, B, Port Fees). 
11
As of January 1, 2026, the Exchange will assess 
a FIX Port Fee based on each mnemonic associated 
with new and legacy FIX Ports. 
12
As proposed, ‘‘Ouch to Trade Options’’ or 
‘‘OTTO’’ is an interface that allows member 
organizations and their Sponsored Customers to 
connect, send, and receive messages related to 
orders, auction orders, and auction responses to the 
Exchange. Features include the following: (1) 
options symbol directory messages (e.g., underlying and complex instruments); (2) system event 
messages (e.g., start of trading hours messages and start of opening); (3) trading action messages (e.g., halts and resumes); (4) execution messages; (5) 
order messages; (6) risk protection triggers and 
cancel notifications; (7) auction notifications; (8) 
auction responses; and (9) post trade allocation 
messages. OTTO will be located in the Exchange’s 
revised rules at Supplementary Material .03 of 
Options 3, Section 7. The Exchange will assess an 
OTTO Port fee of $400 per port, per month, per 
mnemonic, subject to a monthly cap of $4,000. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 102337 
(February 4, 2025), 90 FR 9267 (February 10, 2025) 
(SR–Phlx–2025–05) (Notice of Filing and Immediate 
Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change To Adopt 
a New OTTO Protocol), 
13
FIX DROP is a real-time order and execution 
update message that is sent to a member after an 
order has been received/modified or an execution 
has occurred and contains trade details specific to 
that member. The information includes, among 
other things, the following: (i) executions; (ii) 
cancellations; (iii) modifications to an existing 
order; and (iv) busts or post-trade corrections. FIX 
Drop will be located in the Exchange’s rules at 
Options 3, Section 23(b)(3). The Exchange will 
assess a FIX Drop Fee of $500 per port, per month, 
per account number. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 90 FR 8818 (February 3, 2025) (SR– 
Phlx–2025–04) (Notice of Filing and Immediate 
Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change To Adopt 
a FIX Drop Port and Related Fees). 
14
On November 1, 2025, Phlx began assessing 
OTTO Port Fees and FIX Drop Port Fees to any 
member or member organization that subscribed to 
these new ports. 
15
See 15 U.S.C. 78f(b). 16
See 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4) and (5). A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
Phlx recently completed a technology 
migration to a new platform on 
December 8, 2025. As part of the 
technology migration, Phlx members 
and member organizations acquired new 
ports to connect to the new technology 
platform to accommodate the symbol 
migration plan. Specifically, members 
and member organizations utilized both 
existing or ‘‘legacy’’
4
ports and ‘‘new’’
5
 
ports during the technology migration 
rollout which occurred over a 5 week 
period on a symbol-by-symbol basis. 
During the transition to the new 
platform, Phlx did not assess the SQF 
Port,
6
SQF Purge Port,
7
and CTI Port
8
 
fees in Options 7, Section 9, B for any 
new SQF Ports, SQF Purge Ports, and 
CTI Ports, which were duplicative of 
legacy SQF Ports, SQF Purge Ports, and 
CTI Ports, acquired as part of the 
migration from November 1, 2025 
through December 31, 2025 (‘‘Transition 
Period’’).
9
Phlx did assess the SQF Port, 
SQF Purge Port, and CTI Port fees in 
Options 7, Section 9, B for legacy SQF 
Ports, SQF Purge Ports, and CTI Ports 
during the Transition Period, including 
new SQF Ports, SQF Purge Ports, and 
CTI Ports. The prior Phlx rule change
10
 
provided that, as of January 1, 2026, 
Phlx will assess the SQF Port, SQF 
Purge Port, and CTI Port fees in Options 
7, Section 9, B for all new and legacy 
SQF Ports, SQF Purge Ports, and CTI 
Ports to which they subscribe. Phlx 
members and member organizations 
may return legacy SQF Ports, SQF Purge 
Ports, and CTI Ports in December 2025 
to avoid any fees. Legacy SQF Ports, 
SQF Purge Ports, and CTI Ports are no 
longer necessary since the Phlx 
migration is complete and all trading is 
currently on the new platform. 
SR–Phlx–2025–32 also discussed fees 
for FIX Ports during the Transition 
Period
11
as well as new OTTO
12
Port 
and new FIX Drop
13
Port Fees.
14
 
Finally, Phlx provided that it planned to 
sunset legacy FIX Ports, SQF Ports, SQF 
Purge Ports, and CTI Ports on February 
27, 2026, after which time these ports 
will no longer be available. 
Proposal 
At this time, the Exchange proposes to 
expedite the sunset date for SQF Ports, 
SQF Purge Ports, and CTI Ports from 
February 27, 2026 to January 1, 2026. 
The Phlx migration was complete on 
December 8, 2025. The Exchange 
believes that Phlx market participants 
have enough time to return their SQF 
Ports, SQF Purge Ports, and CTI Ports in 
December 2025 to allow the Exchange to 
sunset these ports. 
This proposal does not impact FIX 
Ports which would sunset on February 
27, 2026. As of January 1, 2026, Phlx 
will assess a FIX Port Fee based on each 
mnemonic associated with new and 
legacy FIX Ports. Phlx members and 
member organizations may return legacy 
FIX Ports in December 2025 to avoid 
any fees or opt to return them any time 
prior to February 27, 2026. 
The Exchange notes that legacy FIX 
Ports currently provide data from the 
new platform while legacy SQF Ports, 
SQF Purge Ports, and CTI Ports do not 
currently provide any data. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
15
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
16
in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees, and other charges 
among members and issuers and other 
persons using any facility, and is not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
Phlx’s proposal to expedite the sunset

and CTI Ports from February 27, 2026 to 
January 1, 2026 is reasonable because 
the Phlx migration was complete on 
December 8, 2025 and the SQF Ports, 
SQF Purge Ports, and CTI Ports are not 
functional at this time. Also, the 
Exchange believes that Phlx market 
participants have enough time to return 
these ports in December 2025 to allow 
the Exchange to sunset these ports. This 
proposal does not impact FIX Ports 
which would sunset on February 27, 
2026. Unlike legacy SQF Ports, SQF 
Purge Ports, and CTI Ports, legacy FIX 
Ports provide data from the new 
platform and are still functional. As of 
January 1, 2026, Phlx will assess a FIX 
Port Fee based on each mnemonic 
associated with new and legacy FIX 
Ports. Phlx members and member 
organizations may return legacy FIX 
Ports in December 2025 to avoid any 
fees. The Exchange notes that Market 
Makers acquire SQF Ports and SQF 
Purge Ports to quote on the Exchange. In 
contrast, all market participants utilize 
FIX Ports to enter orders and may utilize 
CTI Ports for clearing information. The 
Exchange believes that all members and 
member organizations would be able to 
return all legacy ports prior to December 
31, 2025. 
Phlx’s proposal to expedite the sunset 
date for SQF Ports, SQF Purge Ports, 
and CTI Ports from February 27, 2026 to 
January 1, 2026 is equitable and not 
unfairly discriminatory because no Phlx 
member or member organization is able 
to utilize SQF Ports, SQF Purge Ports, 
and CTI Ports today because they are 
not connected to a platform that is 
active. Also, no Phlx member or 
member organization would be able to 
log into their SQF Ports, SQF Purge 
Ports or CTI Ports after the sunset date. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
Intermarket Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
Intermarket Competition 
The Exchange believes its proposal 
remains competitive with other options 
markets, and will offer market 
participants with another choice of 
venue to transact options. The Exchange 
notes that it operates in a highly 
competitive market in which market 
participants can readily favor competing 
venues if they deem fee levels at a 
particular venue to be excessive, or 
rebate opportunities available at other 
venues to be more favorable. Because 
competitors are free to modify their own 
fees in response, and because market 
participants may readily adjust their 
order routing practices, the Exchange 
believes that the degree to which fee 
changes in this market may impose any 
burden on competition is extremely 
limited. 
Intramarket Competition 
Phlx’s proposal to expedite the sunset 
date for SQF Ports, SQF Purge Ports, 
and CTI Ports from February 27, 2026 to 
January 1, 2026 does not impose an 
undue burden on competition because 
no Phlx member or member 
organization is able to utilize SQF Ports, 
SQF Purge Ports or CTI Ports today 
because they are not connected to a 
platform that is active. Also, no Phlx 
member or member organization would 
be able to log into their SQF Ports, SQF 
Purge Ports or CTI Ports after the sunset 
date. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act.
17
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is: (i) necessary or appropriate in 
the public interest; (ii) for the protection 
of investors; or (iii) otherwise in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
If the Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

(defined in EDGX Rule 1.5(ee)) may attach to an 
order stating that the order is not to be displayed 
by the System (defined in EDGX Rule 1.5(cc)) on 
the EDGX Book (defined in EDGX Rule 1.5(d)). An 
order with a Non-Displayed instruction that is to be 
re-routed pursuant to the ‘‘Post to Away’’ routing

Pursuant to EDGX Rule 11.21(a)(2), a ‘‘Retail 
Order’’ is an agency order or riskless principal order 
that meets the criteria of FINRA Rule 5320.03 that 
originates from a natural person and is submitted 
to the Exchange by a Retail Member Organization, 
provided that no change is made to the terms of the 
order with respect to price or side of market and 
the order does not originate from a trading 
algorithm or any other computerized methodology. 
10
See Notice, supra note 3, at 48099. 11
See EDGX Rule 11.6(q)(1). Immediate-or-Cancel (‘‘IOC’’) is an instruction the User may attach to an 
order stating the order is to be executed in whole 
or in part as soon as such order is received. The 
portion not executed immediately on the Exchange 
or another trading center is treated as cancelled and 
is not posted to the EDGX Book. An order with an 
IOC instruction that does not include a Book Only 
instruction (defined in EDGX Rule 21.1(d)(7)) and 
that cannot be executed in accordance with EDGX 
Rule 11.10(a)(4) on the System when reaching the 
Exchange will be eligible for routing away pursuant 
to EDGX Rule 11.11. Under the proposal, because 
Retail Orders may be entered with a time-in-force 
other than IOC, Retail Orders will be allowed to 
post to the EDGX Book or route to away trading 
centers according to User instructions. See Notice, supra note 3, at 48099. 12
Under the proposed Retail Price Improvement 
Program, ‘‘Retail Price Improvement Orders’’ 
consist of non-displayed interest on the Exchange 
that is eligible to interact with incoming Retail 
Orders and that is identified as such. To be 
executable, a Retail Price Improvement Order must 
be priced at least $0.001 better than the Protected 
NBB or Protected NBO (each as defined in EDGX 
Rule 1.5(f)) and may be priced in $0.001 increments 
(e.g., $10.001). The Exchange states that it plans to submit a request for an exemption under Regulation 
NMS Rule 612 that would permit it to accept and 
rank non-displayed Retail Price Improvement 
interest. See Notice, supra note 3, at 48100, n.22. Rule 612 generally prohibits a national securities 
exchange from accepting, displaying, or ranking 
bids, offers, orders and indications of interest in an 
increment smaller than the minimum pricing 
increment. See 17 CFR 242.612. 13

Rule Change To Modify Rule 11.21 To 
Adopt a Retail Price Improvement 
Program and Modify Rule 11.6(e)(2)

Describe the Behavior of Orders 
Containing a Non-Displayed 
Instruction 
December 19, 2025. 
I. Introduction 
On September 30, 2025, Cboe EDGX 
Exchange, Inc. (‘‘EDGX’’ or the 
‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’), pursuant to Section 
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 
thereunder,
2
a proposed rule change to 
modify Rule 11.21 to adopt a Retail 
Price Improvement program (‘‘Retail 
Price Improvement Program’’). The 
Exchange also proposes to modify Rule 
11.6(e)(2) and Rule 11.10(a)(4)(C)–(D) in 
order to describe the behavior of orders 
containing a ‘‘Non-Displayed’’ 
instruction. The proposed rule change 
was published for comment in the 
Federal Register on October 3, 2025.
3
 
On November 3, 2025, pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
4
the 
Commission designated a longer period 
within which to approve the proposed 
rule change, disapprove the proposed 
rule change, or institute proceedings to 
determine whether to disapprove the 
proposed rule change.
5
 
The Commission is publishing this 
order to institute proceedings under 
Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act
6
to 
determine whether to approve or 
disapprove the proposed rule change. 
II. Summary of the Proposal 
As described in more detail in the 
Notice,
7
the Exchange proposes to 
modify Rule 11.21 to add a Retail Price 
Improvement Program, and to modify 
Rules 11.6(e)(2) and Rule 11.10(a)(4)(C)– 
(D) in order to describe the behavior of 
orders containing a ‘‘Non-Displayed’’ 
instruction.
8
 
According to the Exchange, its 
proposed Retail Price Improvement 
Program, designed to provide price 
improvement to Retail Orders,
9
is 
generally consistent with similar 
programs offered by other national 
securities exchanges with the following 
main differences:
10
(1) Retail Orders 
entered on the Exchange may be entered 
with a time-in-force other than 
Immediate-or-Cancel (‘‘IOC’’);
11
(2) 
Retail Price Improvement Orders
12
will 
only be eligible to execute against 
incoming Retail Orders and will not be 
eligible to remove resting Retail Orders 
from the EDGX Book; and (3) Users will 
have the ability to enter the proposed 
Retail Price Improvement Order as a 
MidPoint Peg Order as described in 
Rule 11.8(d).
13
 
The Exchange also proposes to amend 
Rule 11.6(e)(2) and Rule 11.10(a)(4)(C)– 
(D) in order to describe the price at 
which a Non-Displayed Order is posted 
and ranked to the EDGX Book and at 
what price a Non-Displayed Order may 
execute in certain situations.
14
 
III. Proceedings To Determine Whether 
To Approve or Disapprove SR– 
CboeEDGX–2025–072 and Grounds for 
Disapproval Under Consideration 
The Commission is instituting 
proceedings pursuant to Section 
19(b)(2)(B) of the Act
15
to determine 
whether the proposed rule change 
should be approved or disapproved. 
Institution of proceedings is appropriate 
at this time in view of the legal and 
policy issues raised by the proposal. 
Institution of proceedings does not 
indicate that the Commission has 
reached any conclusions with respect to 
any of the issues involved. Rather, as 
described below, the Commission seeks 
and encourages interested persons to 
provide comments on the proposed rule 
change. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)(B) of the 
Act,
16
the Commission is providing 
notice of the grounds for disapproval 
under consideration. As described 
above, the Exchange has proposed to 
modify its rules to add a Retail Price 
Improvement Program, as well as to 
modify its rules relating to how orders 
with Non-Displayed instructions will be 
posted, ranked, and executed. The 
Commission is instituting proceedings 
to allow for additional analysis of, and 
input from commenters with respect to, 
the proposal’s consistency with the Act, 
and in particular with Section 6(b)(5)
17
 
of the Act. Section 6(b)(5) of the Act 
requires that the rules of a national 
securities exchange be designed, among 
other things, to promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest, and not be designed to 
permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.

17 CFR 240.19b–4. 
19
Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, as amended by the 
Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Public Law 
94–29 (Jun. 4, 1975), grants to the Commission 
flexibility to determine what type of proceeding— 
either oral or notice and opportunity for written 
comments—is appropriate for consideration of a 
particular proposal by a self-regulatory 
organization. See Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing & Urban 
Affairs, S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 30 
(1975). 
20
17 CFR 200.30–3(a)(57). 
The Commission asks that 
commenters address the sufficiency of 
the Exchange’s statements in support of 
the proposal, in addition to any other 
comments they may wish to submit 
about the proposed rule change. In 
particular, the Commission seeks 
comment on whether the proposal, 
which would add a Retail Price 
Improvement Program and modify rules 
relating to Non-Displayed order 
instructions: would protect investors 
and the public interest, is not designed 
to permit unfair discrimination, or 
raises any new or novel concerns not 
previously contemplated by the 
Commission. 
IV. Procedure: Request for Written 
Comments 
The Commission requests that 
interested persons provide written 
submissions of their data, views, and 
arguments with respect to the issues 
identified above, as well as any other 
concerns they may have with the 
proposal. In particular, the Commission 
invites the written views of interested 
persons concerning whether the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
Section 6(b)(5) or any other provision of 
the Act, and the rules and regulations 
thereunder. Although there do not 
appear to be any issues relevant to 
approval or disapproval that would be 
facilitated by an oral presentation of 
data, views, and arguments, the 
Commission will consider, pursuant to 
Rule 19b–4 under the Act,
18
any request 
for an opportunity to make an oral 
presentation.
19
 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views, and 
arguments regarding whether the 
proposed rule change should be 
approved or disapproved by January 20, 
2026. Any person who wishes to file a 
rebuttal to any other person’s 
submission must file that rebuttal by 
February 2, 2026.

Upon Written Request, Copies Available 
From: Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 
100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549–2736 
Notice is hereby given that, pursuant 
to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(44 U.S.C. § 3501 et seq.), the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC or 
‘‘Commission’’) is soliciting comments 
on the proposed collection of 
information. 
Paragraph (g) of Rule 17f–1, 17 CFR 
240.17f–1(g), requires that all reporting 
institutions (i.e., every national securities exchange, member thereof, 
registered securities association, broker, 
dealer, municipal securities dealer, 
registered transfer agent, registered 
clearing agency, participant therein, 
member of the Federal Reserve System 
and bank insured by the FDIC) maintain 
and preserve a number of documents 
related to their participation in the Lost 
and Stolen Securities Program 
(‘‘Program’’) under Rule 17f–1. The 
following documents must be kept in an 
easily accessible place for three years, 
according to paragraph (g): (1) copies of 
all reports of theft or loss (Form X–17F– 
1A) filed with the Commission’s 
designee: (2) all agreements between 
reporting institutions regarding 
registration in the Program or other 
aspects of Rule 17f–1; and (3) all 
confirmations or other information 
received from the Commission or its 
designee as a result of inquiry. 
Reporting institutions utilize these 
records and reports (a) to report missing, 
lost, stolen or counterfeit securities to 
the database; (b) to confirm inquiry of 
the database; and (c) to demonstrate 
compliance with Rule 17f–1. The 
Commission and the reporting 
institutions’ examining authorities 
utilize these records to monitor the 
incidence of thefts and losses incurred 
by reporting institutions and to 
determine compliance with Rule 17f–1. 
If such records were not retained by 
reporting institutions, compliance with 
Rule 17f–1 could not be monitored 
effectively. 
The Commission estimates that there 
are approximately 10,018 reporting 
institutions (respondents) and, on 
average, each respondent would need to 
retain 33 records annually, with each 
retention requiring approximately 1 
minute (a total of 33 minutes or 0.5511 
hours per respondent per year). Thus, 
the total estimated annual time burden 
for all respondents is 5,521 hours 
(10,018 × 0.5511 hours = 5,521). Assuming an average hourly cost for 
clerical work of $50.00, the average total 
yearly record retention internal cost of 
compliance for each respondent would 
be $31.35 ($57 × 0.55 hours). Based on these estimates, the total annual internal 
compliance cost for the estimated 
10,018 reporting institutions would be 
approximately $314,064.3 (10,018 × 
$31.35). 
An agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
Control Number. 
Written comments are invited on: (a) 
whether this proposed collection of 
information is necessary for the proper

December 19, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
18, 2025, Cboe Exchange, Inc. (the 
‘‘Exchange’’ or ‘‘Cboe Options’’) filed 
with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ‘‘Commission’’) the 
proposed rule change as described in 
Items I, II, and III below, which Items 
have been prepared by the Exchange. 
The Commission is publishing this 
notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change from interested 
persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
Cboe Exchange, Inc. (the ‘‘Exchange’’ 
or ‘‘Cboe Options’’) proposes to amend 
its fee schedules to establish new fees 
for its 10 gigabit per second (‘‘Gb’’) 
physical port connection to the 
Exchange. The text of the proposed rule 
change is provided in Exhibit 5. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is also available on the Commission’s 
website (https://www.sec.gov/rules/ 
sro.shtml), the Exchange’s website 
(https://www.cboe.com/us/options/ 
regulation/rule_filings/bzx/), and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
fee schedule relating to physical port 
connectivity to the Exchange.
3
 
Specifically, the Exchange seeks to 
amend its fee schedule to establish a 
new fee for its physical port for a 10 
gigabit per second (‘‘Gb’’) circuit. By 
way of background, a physical port is 
utilized by a Trading Permit Holder 
(‘‘TPH’’)
4
or non-TPH to connect to the 
Exchange at the data centers where the 
Exchange’s servers are located. The 
Exchange currently assesses the 
following physical connectivity fees for 
TPHs and non-TPHs on a monthly basis: 
$7,000 per physical port for a 10 Gb 
circuit. The Exchange now seeks to raise 
the monthly per physical port fee for a 
10 Gb circuit from $7,000 to $8,000. The 
Exchange notes the proposed fee change 
will better enable it to continue to 
maintain and improve its market 
technology and services and also notes 
that the proposed fee amount, even as 
amended, continues to be in line with, 
or even lower than, amounts assessed by 
another exchange that offers similar 
functionality. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’) and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.7 [sic] 
Specifically, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)8 requirements that 
the rules of an exchange be designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative 
acts and practices, to promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, to foster 
cooperation and coordination with 
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, 
settling, processing information with 
respect to, and facilitating transactions 
in securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)9 [sic] requirement 
that the rules of an exchange not be 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. The 
Exchange also believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with Section 
6(b)(4)10 [sic] of the Act, which requires 
that Exchange rules provide for the 
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees, and other charges among its 
Members and other persons using its 
facilities. This belief is based on various 
factors as described below. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
fee is reasonable as it is lower than the 
amounts assessed by other exchanges 
for analogous market access connections 
and which were similarly adopted via 
the rule filing process and filed with the 
Commission. For instance, the Exchange 
notes that Nasdaq PHLX LLC (‘‘PHLX’’) 
currently charges its members a $1,650 
installation fee and an ongoing $18,500 
monthly fee for its 10Gb Ulta fiber 
connection.
5
Similarly, PHLX also 
charges its members a $1,000 
installation fee and an ongoing monthly 
fee of $11,000 for its 10Gb fiber 
connection.
6
Comparatively, the 
Exchange’s proposed fee of $8,000 is 
$10,500 less than the ongoing monthly

fee PHLX charges its members for its 
10Gb ultra fiber connection, and $3,000 
less than the ongoing monthly fee for 
PHLX’s 10Gb fiber connection. 
Moreover, unlike PHLX, the Exchange 
does not charge its TPHs and non-TPHs 
an installation fee for its 10 Gb physical 
port connection. 
The Exchange also believes the 
proposed fee change is reasonable as it 
will better align the price of this 
connectivity option to the value it offers 
to the market participants that utilize it. 
It will also better enable the Exchange 
to maintain and improve its 
connectivity services and facilities. 
Finally, the proposed fee change is 
reasonable as the resulting 10 Gb 
physical port fee will be lower than the 
amounts assessed by PHLX for similar 
market access connections. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes that 
the proposal will be an equitable 
allocation of fees and will not 
discriminate unfairly against market 
participants. The proposed fee change is 
an equitable allocation of fees because it 
reflects the substantial value that the 
10Gb circuit provides to TPHs and non- 
TPHs. This connectivity option is 
particularly attractive to TPHs and non- 
TPHs that desire low latency 
connectivity to the Exchange because it 
provides sufficient capacity to support 
most of their activities on the Exchange 
and does so at a reasonable comparative 
price point. The proposal is not unfairly 
discriminatory because 10 Gb physical 
port connectivity will be available to all 
customers at the same price. 
Furthermore, 10 Gb physical port 
connectivity is an optional connectivity 
product, and TPHs and non-TPHs are 
not required to purchase a 10 Gb 
physical port in order to access the 
Exchange. Indeed, TPHs and non-TPHs 
have a variety of options to connect to 
the Exchange, including amongst others, 
the 1 Gb physical port, the pricing for 
which is less expensive and remains 
unchanged. While the proposed price 
increase will impact users of the 10 Gb 
physical port connection, the Exchange 
believes this is fair because users of a 10 
Gb physical port connection generally 
consume more resources from the 
Exchange than do other participants. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
proposed fee change will not impact 
intramarket competition because it will 
apply to all similarly situated TPS and 
non-TPHs equally (i.e., all market participants that choose to purchase the 
10 Gb physical port). Additionally, the 
Exchange does not believe its proposed 
pricing will impose a barrier to entry to 
smaller participants and notes that its 
proposed connectivity pricing is 
associated with relative usage of the 
various market participants. For 
example, market participants with 
modest capacity needs can continue to 
buy the less expensive 1 Gb physical 
port (which cost is not changing) or may 
choose to obtain access via a third-party 
re-seller. While pricing may be 
increased for the larger capacity 
physical ports, such options provide far 
more capacity and are purchased by 
those that consume more resources from 
the network. Accordingly, the proposed 
connectivity fee does not favor certain 
categories of market participants in a 
manner that would impose a burden on 
competition; rather, the allocation 
reflects the network resources 
consumed by the various size of market 
participants—lowest bandwidth 
consuming members pay the least, and 
highest bandwidth consuming members 
pays the most. 
The proposed fee change also does 
not impose a burden on competition or 
on other Self-Regulatory Organizations 
that is not necessary or appropriate. As 
described above, in establishing its 
proposed fee change the Exchange 
compared its proposed fee increase to 
that of a competitor exchange’s 
analogous offering. As noted above, the 
proposed fee of $8,000 is $10,500 less 
than the ongoing monthly fee PHLX 
charges its members for its 10Gb ultra 
fiber connection, and $3,000 less than 
the fee PHLX charges its members for its 
10Gb fiber connection. Moreover, unlike 
PHLX, the Exchange does not charge its 
TPHs and non-TPHs an installation fee 
for its 10 Gb physical port connection. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received comments on the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) 
of the Act
7
and paragraph (f) of Rule 
19b–4
8
thereunder. At any time within 
60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved.

‘‘Specialized Quote Feed’’ or ‘‘SQF’’ is an 
interface that allows Lead Market Makers, 
Streaming Quote Traders (‘‘SQTs’’) and Remote 
Streaming Quote Traders (‘‘RSQTs’’) to connect, 
send, and receive messages related to quotes, 
Immediate-or-Cancel Orders, and auction responses 
into and from the Exchange. Features include the 
following: (1) options symbol directory messages 
(e.g., underlying and complex instruments); (2) system event messages (e.g., start of trading hours messages and start of opening); (3) trading action 
messages (e.g., halts and resumes); (4) execution messages; (5) quote messages; (6) Immediate-or- 
Cancel Order messages; (7) risk protection triggers 
and purge notifications; (8) opening imbalance 
messages; (9) auction notifications; and (10) auction 
responses. The SQF Purge Interface only receives 
and notifies of purge requests from the Lead Market 
Maker, SQT or RSQT. Lead Market Makers, SQTs 
and RSQTs may only enter interest into SQF in 
their assigned options series. Immediate-or-Cancel 
Orders entered into SQF are not subject to the Order 
Price Protection, the Market Order Spread 
Protection, or Size Limitation in Options 3, Section 
15(a)(1), (a)(2) and (b)(2), respectively. See Options 3, Section 7(a)(i)(B).

On December 8, 2025 the Exchange filed SR– 
Phlx–2025–69. On December 16, 2025 the Exchange 
withdrew SR–Phlx–2025–69 and filed this rule 
change.

The term ‘‘Market Maker’’ is defined in Options 
1, Section 1(b)(28) as a member of the Exchange 
who is registered as an options Market Maker 
pursuant to Options 2, Section 12(a). A Market 
Maker includes SQTs and RSQTs as well as Floor 
Market Makers. See Options 7, Section 1(c). The term ‘‘Floor Market Maker’’ is a Market Maker who 
is neither an SQT or an RSQT. A Floor Market 
Maker may provide a quote in open outcry. See 
Options 8, Section 2(a)(4). Only Market Makers 
utilize SQF Ports for quoting purposes.

Notice is hereby given that, pursuant 
to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities 
and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’) is soliciting comments 
on the collection of information 
summarized below. The Commission 
plans to submit this existing collection 
of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget for extension 
and approval. 
Form S–4 (17 CFR 239.25) is the form 
used for registration under the 
Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et 
seq.) of securities issued in business 
combinations transactions. The 
information collected is intended to 
ensure the adequacy of information 
available to investors in connection 
with business combination transactions. 
We estimate that Form S–4 takes 
approximately 3,816.24 hours per 
response to prepare and is filed once per 
year by approximately 228 issuers 
annually. We estimate that 25% of the 
3,816.24 hours per response is carried 
internally by the issuer for an annual 
reporting burden of approximately 
217,526 hours (3,816.24 hours per 
response × 25% × 228 responses annually). We estimate that 75% of the 
3,816.24 hours per response is carried 
externally by outside professionals 
retained by the issuer at an estimated 
rate of $600 per hour for a total annual 
cost burden of approximately 
$391,546,224 (3,816.244 hours per 
response × 75% × $600 per hour × 228 responses annually). 
An agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number. 
Written comments are invited on: (a) 
whether this proposed collection of 
information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the 
agency, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; 
(b) the accuracy of the agency’s estimate 
of the burden imposed by the collection 
of information; (c) ways to enhance the 
quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information collected; and (d) ways to 
minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including 
through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information

74770, 74782–83 (December 9, 2008) (SR– 
NYSEArca–2006–21)). 
At this time, the Exchange proposes to 
offer an opportunity to lower SQF Port 
Fees as of January 1, 2026. Specifically, 
the Exchange proposes to offer certain 
discounts to Market Makers that have 
transacted a certain percentage of Total 
National Volume in the prior month. 
For purposes of this proposal, the 
percentage of Total National Volume is 
calculated by taking the total Market 
Maker Penny Symbol and Market Maker 
Non-Penny Symbol volume (excluding 
index options) executed on the 
Exchange in the prior month and 
attributing a multiple of five times to 
that Non-Penny Symbol volume 
(numerator) and dividing that by Market 
Maker volume (‘‘M’’ capacity at The 
Options Clearing Corporation (‘‘OCC’’)) 
in multiply listed options across all 
options exchanges (denominator or 
Total National Volume). 
Tier Percentage of Total National Volume Percentage SQF Port discount 1 ........................ less than 0.10% ....................................................................................................................... 0 2 ........................ greater than or equal to 0.10% and less than 0.25% ............................................................. 10 3 ........................ greater than or equal to 0.25% and less than 0.40% ............................................................. 30 4 ........................ greater than or equal to 0.40% ................................................................................................ 50 With this proposal, a Market Maker 
that transacted less than 0.10% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
would not receive a discount on SQF 
Port Fees. A Market Maker that 
transacted greater than or equal to 
0.10% and less than 0.25% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
will be afforded a discount of 10% on 
their SQF Port Fees. A Market Maker 
that transacted greater than or equal to 
0.25% and less than 0.40% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
will be afforded a discount of 30% on 
their SQF Port Fees. Finally, a Market 
Maker that transacted greater than or 
equal to 0.40% of Total National 
Volume in the prior month will be 
afforded a discount of 50% on their SQF 
Port Fees. By way of example, a Market 
Maker that executed 3,000,000 in Penny 
Volume and 200,000 in Non-Penny 
Volume in a given month on the 
Exchange, where the Total National 
Volume was 1,000,000,000, would 
qualify for a discount of 50% on their 
SQF Port Fees ((200,000 × 5= 1,000,000) + 3,000,000 = 4,000,000 which is 0.40% 
of 1,000,000,000). 
The Exchange proposes to calculate 
Market Maker Non-Penny Symbol 
volume at five times the weight as 
compared to Market Maker Penny 
Symbol volume because Non-Penny 
Symbols tend to have lower volumes 
and this incentive should encourage a 
greater amount of volume in Non-Penny 
Symbols. Overall, the proposed 
discounts should encourage Market 
Makers to transact additional order flow 
on Phlx with which other market 
participants may interact, for an 
opportunity to lower SQF Port Fees. The 
Exchange proposes to exclude index 
options as index options are generally 
not multiply listed. 
The Exchange also proposes to add 
back the text which provided, ‘‘A 
Market Maker may not subscribe to 
more than 250 SQF Ports per month.’’ 
This rule text was inadvertently omitted 
in the rule text to SR–Phlx–2025–40 
which did not indicate that rule text 
was to be removed. Additionally, the 
Exchange proposes to remove the text 
that states, ‘‘for ports that receive 
inbound quotes at any time within that 
month (‘‘active port’’).’’ SR–Phlx–2025– 
40 replaced Phlx’s SQF Port Fee with an 
SQF Port Fee that was identical to 
Nasdaq ISE, LLC (‘‘ISE’’). 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
7
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
8
in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges 
among members and issuers and other 
persons using any facility, and is not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Commission and the courts have 
repeatedly expressed their preference 
for competition over regulatory 
intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities 
markets. In Regulation NMS, while 
adopting a series of steps to improve the 
current market model, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO 
revenues and, also, recognized that 
current regulation of the market system 
‘‘has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
9
 
Likewise, in NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission
10
 
(‘‘NetCoalition’’) the D.C. Circuit upheld 
the Commission’s use of a market-based 
approach in evaluating the fairness of 
market data fees against a challenge 
claiming that Congress mandated a cost- 
based approach.
11
As the court 
emphasized, the Commission ‘‘intended 
in Regulation NMS that ‘market forces, 
rather than regulatory requirements’ 
play a role in determining the market 
data . . . to be made available to 
investors and at what cost.’’
12
 
Further, ‘‘[n]o one disputes that 
competition for order flow is ‘fierce.’ 
. . . As the SEC explained, ‘[i]n the U.S. 
national market system, buyers and 
sellers of securities, and the broker- 
dealers that act as their order-routing 
agents, have a wide range of choices of 
where to route orders for execution’; 
[and] ‘no exchange can afford to take its 
market share percentages for granted’ 
because ‘no exchange possesses a 
monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in 
the execution of order flow from broker 
dealers’ ....’’13
Although the court 
and the SEC were discussing the cash 
equities markets, the Exchange believes 
that these views apply with equal force 
to the options markets. 
The proposed fee discounts for Phlx 
SQF Ports are reasonable because they 
will attract a greater amount of order 
flow to Phlx with which other market 
participants may interact while also 
lowering costs for certain Market 
Makers that are able to transact greater 
than 0.10% of Total National Volume in 
the prior month. The Exchange believes 
it is reasonable to lower costs for certain 
Market Makers that transact greater than 
0.10% of Total National Volume on 
Phlx because those Market Makers are 
affording other Phlx members and 
member organizations an opportunity to 
interact with that order flow. The 
proposal provides an incremental 
incentive for Market Makers that 
transact at least 0.10% of Total National 
Volume, which provides a higher

Cboe currently offers its market makers credits 
on their monthly BOE Bulk Port Fees. Specifically, 
if a Cboe market maker affiliate (‘‘affiliate’’ defined 
as having at least 75% common ownership between 
the two entities as reflected on each entity’s Form 
BD, Schedule A) or Cboe Appointed OFP receives 
a credit under the Exchange’s Volume Incentive 
Program (‘‘VIP’’), the Cboe market maker will 
receive an access credit on their BOE Bulk Ports 
corresponding to the VIP tier reached. The credit is 
based on the Performance Tier earned by a market 
maker under Cboe’s Liquidity Provider Sliding 
Scale Adjustment Table. Tiers 4 and 5 earn a 40% 
credit on monthly Cboe Bulk Port Fees. Cboe 
assesses BOE Bulk Logical Ports a fee of $1,500 for 
1 to 5 ports, a fee of $2,500 for 6 to 30 ports and 
a fee of $3,000 for over 30 ports. Additionally, each 
BOE Bulk Logical Port will incur the logical port 
fee indicated when used to enter up to 30,000,000 
orders per trading day per logical port as measured 
on average in a single month. Each incremental 
usage of up to 30,000,000 orders per day per BOE 
Bulk Logical Port will incur an additional logical 
port fee of $3,000 per month. Incremental usage 
will be determined on a monthly basis based on the 
average orders per day entered in a single month 
across all subscribed BOE Bulk Logical Ports. 
15
Penny Symbols typically are more liquid 
symbols. 
16
For example, a Phlx Market Maker may desire 
to utilize multiple SQF Ports for accounting 
purposes, to measure performance, for regulatory 
reasons or other determinations that are specific to 
that member organization. 
17
Phlx Market Makers have various regulatory 
requirements as provided for in Options 2, Section 
4. Additionally, Phlx Market Makers have certain 
quoting requirements with respect to their assigned 
options series as provided in Options 2, Section 5. 
SQF Ports are the only quoting protocol available 
on Phlx and only Market Makers may utilize SQF 
Ports. 
18
See Phlx Options 2, Section 5. 19
See Phlx Options 2, Section 4. 20
See Phlx Options 2, Section 1(a)(2). 21
See Phlx Options 2, Section 5. 22
See Phlx Options 2, Section 4. benefit for satisfying increasingly more 
stringent criteria. The Exchange believes 
that the value of the proposed discounts 
is commensurate with the difficulty to 
achieve the corresponding threshold. 
Additionally, the discounts may 
incentivize and attract more volume and 
liquidity to the Exchange, which will 
benefit all Exchange participants 
through increased opportunities to trade 
as well as enhancing price discovery. 
The Exchange’s proposed discounts are 
substantially similar to Cboe Exchange, 
Inc.’s (‘‘Cboe’’) credit for their BOE Bulk 
Port Fees.
14
 
Phlx believes it is reasonable to offer 
fee discounts to those Market Makers 
that primarily provide and post 
liquidity to the Exchange, as it should 
encourage Market Makers to continue to 
participate on the Exchange and add 
liquidity. Greater liquidity benefits all 
market participants by providing more 
trading opportunities and tighter 
spreads. The proposal would also 
mitigate the costs incurred by Market 
Makers on Phlx. 
Calculating Market Maker Non-Penny 
Symbol volume at five times the weight 
as compared to Penny Symbol volume 
is reasonable, equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory as Non-Penny Symbols 
tend to have lower volumes and this 
incentive should encourage a greater 
amount of volume in Market Maker 
Non-Penny Symbols.
15
The Exchange 
proposes to calculate the Market Maker 
Non-Penny Symbol volume in an 
uniform manner for all members and 
member organizations. The Exchange 
proposes to exclude index options as 
index options are generally not multiply 
listed. Index Options would be 
uniformly excluded. 
A Phlx Market Maker requires only 
one SQF Port to submit quotes in its 
assigned options series into Phlx. A 
Phlx Market Maker may submit all 
quotes through one SQF Port. While a 
Phlx Market Maker may elect to obtain 
multiple SQF Ports to organize its 
business,
16
only one SQF Port is 
necessary for a Phlx Market Maker to 
fulfill its regulatory quoting 
obligations.
17
 
The proposed fee discounts for Phlx 
SQF Ports are equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory as they would apply 
uniformly to each Phlx Market Maker. 
The Exchange would uniformly 
calculate the Market Maker’s percentage 
each month. Although only Market 
Makers may receive the proposed 
discounts, the Exchange notes that 
Market Makers are valuable market 
participants that provide liquidity in the 
marketplace and incur costs that other 
market participants do not incur. Unlike 
other market participants, Market 
Makers are required to provide 
continuous two-sided quotes on a daily 
basis,
18
and are subject to various 
obligations associated with providing 
liquidity.
19
While the Exchange is not 
offering a discount to those Market 
Makers that transact less than 0.10% of 
Total National Volume, the Exchange 
notes that these Market Makers transact 
a much lower amount of contracts on 
Phlx as compared to other Market 
Makers who qualify for a discount. In 
some cases, these Market Makers are not 
executing the requisite amount of Penny 
Symbols or Non-Penny Symbols to 
obtain the discount. Market Makers are 
required to demonstrate that they have 
significant market-making and/or Lead 
Market Maker experience in a broad 
array of securities, a proven ability to 
interact with order flow in all types of 
markets, and a willingness and ability to 
make competitive markets on the 
Exchange and otherwise to promote the 
Exchange in a manner that is likely to 
enhance the ability of the Exchange to 
compete successfully for order flow in 
the options it trades, among other 
things.
20
The Exchange believes that all 
Market Makers are capable of quoting 
tighter or in a greater amount of options 
classes to obtain the requisite volume to 
achieve a discount. 
The Exchange’s proposal to add back 
the text which provided, ‘‘A Market 
Maker may not subscribe to more than 
250 SQF Ports per month’’ is reasonable, 
equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory as that rule text was 
inadvertently not displayed in the rule 
text to SR–Phlx–2025–40 and was not 
intended to be removed. There was no 
mention of its removal in SR–Phlx– 
2025–40. The Exchange’s proposal to 
remove the words ‘‘for ports that receive 
inbound quotes at any time within that 
month (‘‘active port’’)’’ is reasonable, 
equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory as SR–Phlx–2025–40 
replaced Phlx’s SQF Port Fee with an 
SQF Port Fee that was identical to ISE. 
Other rule text that mentioned active 
SQF Ports was removed in SR–Phlx– 
2025–40. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
In terms of intra-market competition, 
the proposed fee discounts for Phlx SQF 
Ports do not impose a burden on 
competition because they would apply 
uniformly to each Phlx Market Maker 
and the Exchange would uniformly 
calculate the Market Maker’s percentage 
each month. Although only Market 
Makers may receive the proposed 
discounts, the Exchange notes that 
Market Makers are valuable market 
participants that provide liquidity in the 
marketplace and incur costs that other 
market participants do not incur. Unlike 
other market participants, Market 
Makers are required to provide 
continuous two-sided quotes on a daily 
basis,
21
and are subject to various 
obligations associated with providing 
liquidity.
22
Further, while the Exchange 
is not offering a discount to those 
Market Makers that transact less than 
0.10% of Total National Volume, the 
Exchange notes that these Market 
Makers transact a much lower amount 
of contracts on Phlx as compared to 
other Market Makers that qualify for the 
discount and/or these Market Makers 
are not executing the requisite amount 
of Penny Symbols or Non-Penny 
Symbols to obtain the discount. The

On December 12, 2025, FICC filed this proposed 
rule change as an advance notice (SR–FICC–2025– 
801) with the Commission pursuant to Section 
806(e)(1) of Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act entitled the 
Payment, Clearing, and Settlement Supervision Act 
of 2010, 12 U.S.C. 5465(e)(1), and Rule 19b– 
4(n)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.19b– 
4(n)(1)(i). A copy of the advance notice is available 
at www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings. 
4
Partial Amendment No. 1 makes clarifications 
and corrections to the narrative description of the 
proposed rule change and Exhibit 5A of the filing. 
Specifically, the Amendment corrects the narrative 
description of a proposed change to the GSD Rules 
to accurately reflect the change, as it appears in 
Exhibit 5A. The Amendment also modifies Exhibit 
to correct a typographical error and mismarked rule 
text as compared to the currently effective GSD 
Rules. These clarifications and corrections have 
been incorporated, as appropriate, into the 
description of the proposed rule change in Item II 
below. 
Exchange’s proposal does not impose an 
undue burden on competition because 
Market Makers are required to 
demonstrate that they have significant 
market-making and/or Lead Market 
Maker experience in a broad array of 
securities, a proven ability to interact 
with order flow in all types of markets, 
and a willingness and ability to make 
competitive markets on the Exchange 
and otherwise to promote the Exchange 
in a manner that is likely to enhance the 
ability of the Exchange to compete 
successfully for order flow in the 
options it trades, among other things.
23
 
The Exchange believes that all Market 
Makers are capable of quoting tighter or 
in a greater amount of options classes to 
obtain the requisite volume to achieve a 
discount. 
The Exchange’s proposal to add back 
the text which provided, ‘‘A Market 
Maker may not subscribe to more than 
250 SQF Ports per month’’ does not 
impose an undue burden on 
competition as that rule text was 
inadvertently not displayed in the rule 
text to SR–Phlx–2025–40 and was not 
intended to be removed. There was no 
mention of its removal in SR–Phlx– 
2025–40. Also, the Exchange’s proposal 
to remove the words ‘‘for ports that 
receive inbound quotes at any time 
within that month (‘‘active port’’)’’ does 
not impose an undue burden on 
competition as SR–Phlx–2025–40 
replaced Phlx’s SQF Port Fee with an 
SQF Port Fee that was identical to ISE. 
Other rule text that mentioned active 
SQF Ports was removed in SR–Phlx– 
2025–40. 
In terms of inter-market competition, 
the Exchange notes that it operates in a 
highly competitive market in which 
market participants can readily favor 
competing venues if they deem fee 
levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive, or rebate opportunities 
available at other venues to be more 
favorable. In such an environment, the 
Exchange must continually adjust its 
fees to remain competitive with other 
options exchanges. In addition to the 
Exchange, market participants have 
alternative options exchanges that they 
may participate on and direct their 
order flow. In sum, if the changes 
proposed herein are unattractive to 
market participants, it is likely that the 
Exchange will lose market share as a 
result. Accordingly, the Exchange does 
not believe that the proposed changes 
will impair the ability of members or 
competing options exchanges to 
maintain their competitive standing in 
the financial markets.

this notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change, as modified by 
Partial Amendment No. 1 (hereafter ‘‘the 
proposed rule change’’), from interested 
persons. 
I. Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Terms of Substance of the Proposed 
Rule Change 
FICC is proposing a rule change 
related to its cross-margining 
arrangement (the ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Arrangement’’) with the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange Inc. (‘‘CME,’’ and 
collectively with FICC, the ‘‘Clearing 
Organizations’’ or ‘‘Parties’’). The 
proposed rule change consists of (i) a 
proposed Third Amended and Restated 
Cross-Margining Agreement (the ‘‘Third 
A&R Agreement’’) between FICC and 
CME, which would replace the Second 
Amended and Restated Cross-Margining 
Agreement between the Parties (the 
‘‘Second A&R Agreement’’) in its 
entirety and would be incorporated into 
the FICC Government Securities 
Division (‘‘GSD’’) Rulebook (‘‘GSD 
Rules’’), and (ii) a number of related rule 
changes to the GSD Rules. Together, the 
proposed changes would extend the 
availability of the Cross-Margining 
Arrangement to positions cleared and 
carried for customers by a dually 
registered broker-dealer (‘‘BD’’) and 
futures commission merchant (‘‘FCM’’) 
that is a common member of FICC and 
CME (an ‘‘Eligible BD–FCM’’).

II. Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the 
Proposed Rule Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
clearing agency included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
clearing agency has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, 
and C below, of the most significant 
aspects of such statements. 
(A) Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the 
Proposed Rule Change 
1. Purpose 
Currently, the Cross-Margining 
Arrangement allows FICC and CME to 
recognize for margin purposes the 
offsetting risk of certain positions in 
futures on U.S. Treasury securities and 
other interest rate futures and Treasury 
market transactions (‘‘Eligible 
Positions’’) maintained by a member of 
both Clearing Organizations (a ‘‘Joint 
Clearing Member’’) for itself or certain 
eligible affiliates (an ‘‘Eligible 
Affiliate’’), or by affiliated members of 
CME and FICC (each, a ‘‘Cross- 
Margining Affiliate,’’ and each Joint 
Clearing Member and each Cross- 
Margining Affiliate, a ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Participant’’), at the two Clearing 
Organizations in circumstances when 
the Clearing Organizations can look to 
all of those positions (and all associated 
margin) for performance of the Joint 
Clearing Member’s or a pair of Cross- 
Margining Affiliates’ obligations (the 
‘‘Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement’’). In particular, the 
Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement allows the Clearing 
Organizations to consider the net risk of 
a Joint Clearing Member’s and its 
Eligible Affiliates’ Eligible Positions or a 
pair of Cross-Margining Affiliates’ 
Eligible Positions at FICC and CME 
when setting margin requirements for 
such positions.
6
Any resulting margin 
reductions create capital efficiencies for 
the Cross-Margining Participants and 
their Eligible Affiliates and incentivize 
them to maintain or carry portfolios that 
present lower overall risk. 
FICC and CME have submitted to the 
Commission and the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission (the 
‘‘CFTC’’) petitions for exemptive relief 
from certain provisions of the 
Commodity Exchange Act (‘‘CEA’’) and 
Exchange Act that would enable FICC 
and CME to make cross-margining 
available to customers (other than an 
Eligible Affiliate) of an Eligible BD–FCM 
(‘‘Cross-Margining Customers’’).
7
The 
proposed rule changes aim to set forth 
a customer cross-margining arrangement 
that is consistent with the descriptions 
in the Petitions and the requirements of 
the Proposed Orders (the ‘‘Customer 
Cross-Margining Arrangement’’). The 
Customer Cross-Margining Arrangement 
would allow Cross-Margining 
Customers to benefit from the margin 
reductions that are currently only 
available to Cross-Margining 
Participants and their Eligible Affiliates 
under the Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement. As a result, it would 
facilitate access to clearing for indirect 
participants, promote the maintenance 
of more balanced portfolios that present 
lower risk, and enhance liquidity in, 
and otherwise promote the resilience 
and robustness of, the Treasury market. 
The Third A&R Agreement would 
effectuate the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement via the following features: 
€Eligibility Criteria and Participation Requirements. The Third A&R Agreement would set out the eligibility 
criteria for a Joint Clearing Member and 
its Cross-Margining Customer to 
participate in the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement, as well as the 
requirements that would apply to such 
a Joint Clearing Member and its Cross- 
Margining Customer. These include the 
requirements that: 
ÆA Joint Clearing Member be an Eligible BD–FCM; 
ÆEach Cross-Margining Customer be a ‘‘futures customer’’ within the 
meaning of CFTC Regulation 1.3 and a 
‘‘Sponsored Member’’ or ‘‘Executing 
Firm Customer’’ as defined under the 
GSD Rules; 
ÆThe Joint Clearing Member enter into a participant agreement with the 
Clearing Organizations; and 
ÆThe Joint Clearing Member enter into an agreement with each Cross- 
Margining Customer containing certain 
terms, including that the Cross- 
Margining Customer agrees to 
subordinate its claims under the 
Securities Investor Protection Act of 
1970 (‘‘SIPA’’) and Subchapter III of 
Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code 
in relation to its cross-margined 
positions and associated margin (the 
‘‘Subordination Agreement’’). 
As discussed in greater detail below, 
these criteria and requirements for 
participation are designed to ensure that 
each participating Cross-Margining 
Customer and its Joint Clearing Member 
satisfy certain conditions set forth in the 
Proposed Orders. 
€Customer Cross-Margining Accounts. The Third A&R Agreement would include provisions to enable 
Eligible BD–FCMs to establish 
‘‘Customer Cross-Margining Accounts’’ 
for purposes of recording Eligible

The SLA is provided as confidential Exhibit 3 
to this proposed rule change. 
Positions at the Clearing Organizations 
(such Eligible Positions in a Customer 
Cross-Margining Account, ‘‘Customer 
Positions’’) and set forth a definition of 
‘‘Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Accounts’’ to refer to the accounts 
established by Eligible BD–FCMs at the 
Clearing Organizations for the purposes 
of recording positions subject to the 
Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement (‘‘Proprietary Positions’’). 
€Margin Methodology. The Third A&R Agreement would include 
provisions describing the methodology 
for calculating potential reductions to 
the margin requirements for Customer 
Positions. As discussed in greater detail 
below, FICC is proposing to apply the 
same margin reduction methodology to 
Customer Positions as it applies to 
Proprietary Positions, with margin 
reductions calculated on a customer-by- 
customer basis for each Cross-Margining 
Customer. 
€Default Management. The Third A&R Agreement would include 
provisions to address how the Clearing 
Organizations would manage a default 
of a Cross-Margining Participant (a 
‘‘Defaulting Member’’) carrying 
positions for Cross-Margining 
Customers. Under the Third A&R 
Agreement, the Clearing Organizations 
would follow substantially the same 
approach to handling Customer 
Positions carried by a Defaulting 
Member as applies to Proprietary 
Positions. However, Customer Positions 
and Proprietary Positions and associated 
margin would form part of separate 
‘‘Liquidation Portfolios’’ and therefore 
would not be netted against one another 
in calculating Net Gain or Net Loss (or 
VM Net Gain or VM Net Loss) under the 
Cross-Margining Agreement. By virtue 
of these changes, the Clearing 
Organizations would not be able to 
apply Customer Positions or associated 
margin to the obligations arising under 
a Defaulting Member’s Proprietary 
Positions. The Third A&R Agreement 
would also include edits clarifying that 
the Clearing Organizations may ‘‘port’’ 
Customer Positions to another clearing 
member in a default scenario. 
In addition to replacing the Second 
A&R Agreement with the Third A&R 
Agreement, FICC proposes the following 
changes to the GSD Rules to effectuate 
the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement: 
€Account Structure. FICC proposes to create a new Account type, the 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Account,’’ 
for purposes of recording FICC-cleared 
Customer Positions. 
€Margin Methodology and Treatment. As discussed in greater detail below, under the proposed 
changes, FICC would collect and hold 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin in a 
substantially similar manner to how it 
collects and holds ‘‘Segregated 
Customer Margin’’ (as defined under the 
GSD Rules), with certain adjustments to 
ensure consistency with the 
requirements of the Proposed Orders 
and the general requirements and 
conventions applicable to futures. 
Consistent with how it treats Segregated 
Customer Margin, FICC would credit all 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
collected from an Eligible BD–FCM to a 
securities account on its books and 
records in the name of the Eligible BD– 
FCM for the benefit of its customers (a 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Custody Account’’). FICC would also 
agree to treat all assets credited to the 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Custody Account as ‘‘financial assets’’ 
credited to a ‘‘securities account’’ for 
which FICC is the ‘‘securities 
intermediary,’’ as such terms are used in 
Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial 
Code as in effect in the State of New 
York (‘‘NYUCC’’). This treatment is 
designed to ensure that Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin does not form part of 
FICC’s bankruptcy estate and is not 
exposed to the claims of FICC’s general 
creditors, and is instead reserved for 
Eligible BD–FCMs claiming on behalf of 
their Cross-Margining Customers. 
Consistent with how it holds Segregated 
Customer Margin, FICC would hold 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin in a 
segregated account at a bank insured by 
the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation and at the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York (the ‘‘FRBNY’’). In 
accordance with the Proposed Orders, 
any such account (other than one at the 
FRBNY) would need to be subject to a 
written notice consistent with the 
Proposed Orders. 
€Conforming and Clarifying Changes. FICC proposes to make a number of clarifying and conforming 
edits to the GSD Rules, including (i) 
adding references to Cross-Margining 
Customer, Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin, Cross-Margining Customer 
Account, and Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin Requirements to relevant 
provisions that refer to Indirect 
Participants, initial margin collected by 
FICC, position accounts maintained by 
FICC, and FICC’s initial margin 
requirements; (ii) removing the existing 
prohibition under Section 10(e) of Rule 
3A on Sponsored Members from 
participating in the Cross-Margining 
Arrangement; (iii) expanding Rule 43, 
which sets forth certain terms related to 
the Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, to encompass the 
Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement; and (iv) removing 
references to the Market Professionals 
cross-margining arrangement, which is 
no longer offered by FICC. 
The Third A&R Agreement would also 
include a number of clarifying and 
conforming edits, including to make 
clear that, with respect to both the 
Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement and Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement, FICC and CME 
would only manage a default of a Joint 
Clearing Member independently of one 
another if a joint management or buy- 
out by one of the Clearing Organizations 
were not legally permissible or possible 
or would result in substantially greater 
losses to each Clearing Organization. 
In addition, the Second A&R 
Agreement is supplemented by a 
Service Level Agreement (‘‘SLA’’) 
between FICC and CME. FICC and CME 
will make edits to the SLA as necessary 
to ensure conformance with the 
proposed Third A&R Agreement.
8
 
(i) The Proposed Third A&R Agreement 
As noted above, FICC proposes to 
enter into the Third A&R Agreement 
with CME. The proposed changes to the 
Second A&R Agreement contained in 
the Third A&R Agreement are designed 
to make cross-margining available to 
Cross-Margining Customers consistently 
with the framework set out in the 
Proposed Orders. FICC believes that 
such amendments would promote the 
maintenance of more balanced 
portfolios that present lower risk and 
facilitate the access of indirect 
participants to central clearing in 
accordance with Rule 17ad-22 under the 
Exchange Act. 
A. Eligibility Criteria and Participation 
Requirements 
a. Eligibility Criteria for Joint Clearing 
Members 
The Third A&R Agreement would set 
forth the eligibility criteria for a Cross- 
Margining Participant to participate in 
the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement. To facilitate compliance 
with the conditions and limitations of 
the Proposed Orders, Section 2(a) of the 
Third A&R Agreement would provide 
that, to become a Cross-Margining 
Participant for the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement and establish a 
Customer Cross-Margining Account, a 
Clearing Member would need to be a 
Joint Clearing Member that is both a BD 
registered with the Commission and an 
FCM registered with the CFTC (i.e., an VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:17 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00188 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\29DEN1.SGM 29DEN1

Eligible BD–FCM).
9
Section 3(a) of the 
Third A&R Agreement would further 
require that the Eligible BD–FCM hold 
the Cross-Margining Customer’s 
Customer Positions at FICC and 
associated money, securities and 
property together with such customer’s 
Customer Positions at CME and the 
associated ‘‘futures customer funds,’’ as 
defined in CFTC Regulation 1.3, held by 
the Eligible BD–FCM, in a ‘‘futures 
account,’’ as defined in CFTC 
Regulation 1.3, ‘‘in accordance with any 
conditions set forth in the regulatory 
approvals of [the Third A&R Agreement] 
issued by [the Commission] and CFTC 
and applicable law.’’
10
 
In addition, the Eligible BD–FCM 
would be required to enter into a 
participant agreement with FICC and 
CME in the form of Appendix C to the 
Third A&R Agreement (the ‘‘Customer 
Cross-Margining Clearing Member 
Agreement’’), which is further described 
below.
11
The definition of ‘‘Clearing 
Member Agreement’’ would 
correspondingly be amended to refer, 
with respect to the Proprietary Cross- 
Margining Arrangement, to the existing 
participant agreement currently in 
Appendix A or Appendix B of the 
Second A&R Agreement (the 
‘‘Proprietary Clearing Member 
Agreement’’), as applicable, and with 
respect to the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, to the Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing Member 
Agreement.
12
 
As a conforming change, Sections 2(a) 
and (c) and the first sentence of Section 
2(a) of the Third A&R Agreement would 
also be amended to provide that the pre- 
existing language therein applies to a 
Cross-Margining Participant for the 
Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement.
13
 
b. Definition of Customer and Non- 
Customer 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement would only be available 
for the positions carried by an Eligible 
BD–FCM for ‘‘Customers.’’ To ensure 
compliance with the limitations under 
the Proposed Orders of the types of 
persons eligible to be Cross-Margining 
Customers, the Third A&R Agreement 
would define ‘‘Customer’’ as an indirect 
clearing participant that meets the 
definition of futures customer set out in 
CFTC Regulation 1.3 and is a 
‘‘Sponsored Member’’ or ‘‘Executing 
Firm Customer’’ as defined under the 
GSD Rules.
14
CFTC Regulation 1.3 
defines ‘‘futures customer’’ to mean any 
person who uses an FCM as an agent in 
connection with trading in any futures 
contract, but excludes persons whose 
futures positions are held in a 
‘‘proprietary account.’’
15
Any Customer 
wishing to participate in the Customer 
Cross-Margining Arrangement would 
need to enter into an agreement with its 
Eligible BD–FCM that includes certain 
terms described in greater detail below 
(the ‘‘Customer Agreement’’).
16
Because 
affiliates of the Eligible BD–FCM would 
generally have their CME-cleared 
futures positions held in a proprietary 
account of the Eligible BD–FCM, such 
affiliates would not constitute ‘‘futures 
customers’’ under CFTC Regulation 1.3. 
However, Eligible Affiliates would 
continue to be able to access cross- 
margining under the Proprietary Cross- 
Margining Arrangement so long as they 
constitute ‘‘Non-Customers.’’
17
The 
Third A&R Agreement would revise the 
definition of ‘‘Non-Customer’’ to mean 
any affiliate of the Eligible BD–FCM or 
any person that is an officer, director, 
partner or other related person of the 
Eligible BD–FCM (i) that is not a 
‘‘customer’’ of the Eligible BD–FCM 
within the meaning of SIPA, Subchapter 
III of Chapter VII of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code, or Exchange Act Rule 15c3–3, and 
(ii) whose CME-cleared positions are 
carried in a proprietary account of the 
Eligible BD–FCM.
18
 
c. Relationship Between the Clearing 
Organizations and Cross-Margining 
Customers 
Because a Cross-Margining 
Customer’s participation in the 
Customer Cross-Margining Arrangement 
would be intermediated through the 
Eligible BD–FCM, Section 2(a) of the 
Third A&R Agreement would specify 
that the Clearing Organizations would 
have no obligation to deal directly with 
a Cross-Margining Customer, and that a 
Cross-Margining Customer would have 
no right to assert a claim against a 
Clearing Organization with respect to, 
nor would a Clearing Organization be 
liable to a Cross-Margining Customer 
for, any obligations of a Clearing 
Organization in connection with the 
Cross-Margining Customer’s 
participation in the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement pursuant to the 
Third A&R Agreement.
19
These terms 
are consistent with those applicable to 
Eligible Firm Customers under the GSD 
Rules, as well as those applicable to 
customers under CME’s rules.
20
 
B. Customer Cross-Margining Account 
To effectuate the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement, the Third A&R 
Agreement would include changes to 
enable an Eligible BD–FCM to establish 
a ‘‘Customer Cross-Margining Account’’ 
separate from any of its ‘‘Proprietary 
Cross-Margining Accounts.’’ 
A Customer Cross-Margining Account 
would be defined as, with respect to 
FICC, an Indirect Participants Account 
(as defined in the GSD Rules) at FICC 
maintained for Cross-Margining 
Customers and identified in FICC’s 
books and records as being subject to 
the Third A&R Agreement (which, as 
discussed below, would be the ‘‘Cross- 
Margining Customer Account’’ under 
the GSD Rules) and with respect to 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:17 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00189 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\29DEN1.SGM 29DEN1

CME, an account carried on the books 
and records of CME for an Eligible BD– 
FCM, which contains only the positions, 
transactions, and margin of that Eligible 
BD–FCM’s Cross-Margining 
Customers.
21
A Proprietary Cross- 
Margining Account would be defined 
as, with respect to FICC, a Proprietary 
Account at FICC (as defined in the GSD 
Rules) or an Indirect Participants 
Account at FICC that is maintained for 
Non-Customers and identified in FICC’s 
books and records as being subject to 
the Third A&R Agreement, and, with 
respect to CME, an account carried on 
the books and records of CME for an 
Eligible BD–FCM, which contains only 
the positions, transactions, and margin 
of the ‘‘proprietary accounts’’ (as 
defined in CFTC Regulation 1.3) of the 
Eligible BD–FCM.
22
 
The Third A&R Agreement would also 
define ‘‘Cross-Margining Account’’ to 
mean either a Proprietary Cross- 
Margining Account or a Customer Cross- 
Margining Account.
23
An Eligible BD– 
FCM would be required to designate 
each Cross-Margining Account it opens 
at the Clearing Organizations as either a 
Customer Cross-Margining Account or a 
Proprietary Cross-Margining Account.
24
 
C. Margin Methodology 
The Third A&R Agreement would also 
specify how potential margin reductions 
would be calculated for Customer 
Positions carried in a Customer Cross- 
Margining Account. As with Proprietary 
Positions, each Clearing Organization 
would calculate the margin savings that 
would result from viewing the 
‘‘Combined Portfolio’’ of CME-cleared 
Customer Positions and FICC-cleared 
Customer Positions as a single portfolio 
rather than as separate standalone 
portfolios. The Clearing Organizations 
would then compare the respective 
margin reduction percentages, and each 
would then reduce the margin required 
for the Combined Portfolio by the lower 
percentage (subject to a cap of 80%). For 
Customer Positions, this process would 
occur on a Cross-Margining Customer- 
by-Cross-Margining Customer basis. In 
other words, each Cross-Margining 
Customer’s Customer Positions would 
form part of a separate Combined 
Portfolio. This customer-by-customer 
approach is consistent both with how 
futures contracts are required to be 
margined under the rules of the CFTC, 
as well as how FICC margins Segregated 
Indirect Participant positions.
25
 
To implement this margin reduction 
methodology, the Third A&R Agreement 
would redefine ‘‘Combined Portfolio’’ to 
mean, in the case of a Pair of Cross- 
Margining Accounts consisting of 
Proprietary Cross-Margining Accounts, 
all Eligible Positions in such Cross- 
Margining Accounts, and in the case of 
a Pair of Cross-Margining Accounts 
consisting of Customer Cross-Margining 
Accounts, all Eligible Positions of a 
single Customer in such Cross- 
Margining Accounts.
26
The term ‘‘Pair 
of Cross-Margining Accounts,’’ in turn, 
would be defined to mean a Customer 
Cross-Margining Account at CME and a 
Customer Cross-Margining Account at 
FICC or a Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Account at CME and a Proprietary 
Cross-Margining Account at FICC.
27
The 
Third A&R Agreement would clarify 
that an Eligible BD–FCM would only be 
able to establish one Pair of Cross- 
Margining Accounts for each type of 
Indirect Participants Account offered at 
FICC under the GSD Rules and that the 
Customer Positions of the same Cross- 
Margining Customer may not be 
maintained in multiple Pairs of Cross- 
Margining Accounts of the same Eligible 
BD–FCM.
28
This limitation is aimed at 
ensuring that, as is the case with futures 
contracts, an Eligible BD–FCM would 
not be permitted to establish a separate 
account at the Clearing Organization for 
a particular customer or group of 
customers. 
In addition to these changes, the 
Third A&R Agreement would include 
conforming changes in Section 4 to 
make clear that the margin calculations 
are performed on the Combined 
Portfolio and to provide that Sections 
4(c) and 4(e), concerning the ability of 
the Clearing Organizations to require 
margin equal to or in excess of the 
Standalone Margin Requirement, would 
apply in relation to each Cross- 
Margining Account.
29
The Third A&R 
Agreement would also make conforming 
changes to a number of defined terms 
by: 
€Revising the definition of ‘‘Cross- Margin Requirement’’ to refer to the 
joint amount of Margin required by 
FICC and CME in connection with a 
Combined Portfolio as provided for in 
Section 4(a) of the Third A&R 
Agreement; 
€Revising definitions of ‘‘Margin Reduction’’ and ‘‘Variation Margin’’ to 
clarify that these terms apply separately 
with respect to Proprietary Cross- 
Margining Accounts and Customer 
Cross-Margining Accounts; 
€Further revising the ‘‘Variation Margin’’ definition to reflect that 
amounts may be owed by or to a Cross- 
Margining Customer in relation to 
positions recorded in a Customer Cross- 
Margining Account; 
€Revising the definition of ‘‘Stand- Alone Margin Requirement’’ to provide 
that it is determined with respect to a 
particular Cross-Margining Account, 
and that with regard to a Stand-Alone 
Margin Requirement of FICC, such 
requirement is calculated without 
regard to any netting across positions of 
multiple Executing Firm Customers in 
the same Agent Clearing Member 
Omnibus Account (as such terms are 
defined in the GSD Rules); 
€Revising the definition of ‘‘Margin’’ to include Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin securing the obligations of a 
Cross-Margining Customer and to 
contemplate a Joint Clearing Member 
having multiple Cross-Margining 
Accounts; and 
€Removing the definition of ‘‘Cross- Margin Positions,’’ which would no 
longer be used.
30
 
Section 6(b) of the Third A&R 
Agreement would be revised to require 
FICC and CME to notify each other in 
the event a material problem arises with 
respect to a Cross-Margining Customer 
in the same manner as they are 
currently required to do with respect to 
Cross-Margining Participants.
31
 
D. Default Management 
The Third A&R Agreement would 
include certain adjustments to the 
default management provisions to 
describe how the Clearing Organizations 
would address a default of an Eligible 
BD–FCM that is carrying Customer 
Positions for Cross-Margining 
Customers, elaborate on the steps the 
Clearing Organizations may take in a 
joint liquidation, and clarify when the 
Clearing Organizations may manage the 
default of a Cross-Margining Participant 
independently of one another. 
The Third A&R Agreement would 
subject Customer Positions to 
substantially the same default 
management process as Proprietary 
Positions. In particular, under Section

7(b) of the Third A&R Agreement, the 
Clearing Organizations would attempt 
in good faith to jointly transfer, 
liquidate, or close-out the Proprietary 
Positions or Customer Positions, which 
may include a joint liquidating auction 
so that hedged positions can be closed- 
out simultaneously or, in the case of a 
transfer of Customer Positions, so that 
the positions of each Cross-Margining 
Customer in a Combined Portfolio can, 
if feasible, be transferred to the same 
clearing firm. Section 7(b) would further 
provide that if one Clearing 
Organization determines that such joint 
action is not feasible or advisable for 
any Liquidation Portfolio, then either 
Clearing Organization could buy-out the 
Proprietary Positions or Customer 
Positions in such Liquidation Portfolio 
at the other Clearing Organization in 
accordance with the existing terms of 
the Third A&R agreement related to buy- 
outs. Lastly, Section 7(b) would provide 
that if one Clearing Organization 
determines that neither the joint 
transfer, liquidation, or close-out option 
nor the buy-out option is legally 
permissible or possible as to a particular 
Liquidation Portfolio, or if such 
methods would result in substantially 
greater losses to each Clearing 
Organization than in the case of a 
separate liquidation by each Clearing 
Organization, the Clearing 
Organizations could conduct separate 
liquidations in accordance with the 
existing terms related to such separate 
liquidations.
32
The Clearing 
Organizations do not foresee particular 
circumstances that could lead to 
separate liquidations being applicable. 
To the contrary, the Clearing 
Organizations believe it is highly 
unlikely that they would engage in 
separate liquidations. However, the 
Clearing Organizations believe it is 
prudent to have a separate liquidation 
option so that there is a clear 
methodology in the very unlikely event 
that some unforeseen circumstance 
causes it not to be possible or legally 
permissible to conduct a joint 
liquidation or buy-out or for such 
methods to result in substantially 
greater costs. 
The Third A&R Agreement would also 
include provisions designed to ensure 
that Customer Positions and associated 
margin are not used by either Clearing 
Organization to satisfy obligations 
arising from Proprietary Positions. The 
principal mechanism to achieve this 
would be a new concept of a 
‘‘Liquidation Portfolio,’’ which would 
be defined as, with respect to a 
Defaulting Member, all such Defaulting 
Member’s Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Account(s) or all such Defaulting 
Member’s Customer Cross-Margining 
Account(s).
33
The definitions of 
‘‘Collateral on Hand,’’ ‘‘Net Gain,’’ ‘‘Net 
Loss,’’ ‘‘Cross-Margin VM Gain,’’ 
‘‘Cross-Margin VM Loss,’’ ‘‘Other VM 
Gain,’’ ‘‘Liquidation Cost,’’ and ‘‘Share 
of the Cross-Margining Requirement,’’ in 
turn, would be revised so that they are 
separately determined by reference to 
each Liquidation Portfolio, rather than 
to a Defaulting Member or Cross- 
Margining Account.
34
The Third A&R 
Agreement would also provide for the 
concept of a ‘‘Related GSD Account,’’ 
which would be defined as, with respect 
to a Liquidation Portfolio of a Defaulting 
Member consisting of Proprietary Cross- 
Margining Accounts, the ‘‘Proprietary 
Accounts’’ (as defined in the GSD Rules) 
of the Defaulting Member at FICC, and 
with respect to a Liquidation Portfolio 
of a Defaulting Member consisting of 
Customer Cross-Margining Accounts, 
the Indirect Participant Account(s) of 
the Defaulting Member at FICC.
35
 
In addition, the Third A&R Agreement 
would revise Sections 7(b) through (g) to 
clarify that the provisions thereof would 
apply separately to each Liquidation 
Portfolio. These changes include 
replacing certain references to ‘‘Cross- 
Margining Account’’ with ‘‘Liquidation 
Portfolio,’’
36
additional language 
specifying that provisions apply with 
respect to each Liquidation Portfolio,
37
 
and deletions of language providing for 
liquidation actions or calculations to be 
performed with respect to a Defaulting 
Member.
38
In addition, as mentioned 
above, the definition of ‘‘Combined 
Portfolio’’ would be revised to mean, in 
the case of a Pair of Cross-Margining 
Accounts consisting of Proprietary 
Cross-Margining Accounts, all Eligible 
Positions in such Cross-Margining 
Accounts, and in the case of a Pair of 
Cross-Margining Accounts consisting of 
Customer Cross-Margining Accounts, all 
Eligible Positions of a single Customer 
in such Cross-Margining Accounts.
39
 
By virtue of these changes, upon a 
default of a Joint Clearing Member, the 
Proprietary Positions and associated 
margin of the Joint Clearing Member 
would be closed-out and netted into a 
single Net Gain or Net Loss, and the 
Customer Positions and associated 
margin would be separately close-out 
and netted into a separate Net Gain or 
Net Loss. As a result of these separate 
calculations, Customer Positions and 
associated margin could not be used to 
satisfy obligations arising under any 
Proprietary Positions. Similarly, 
variation margin gains in respect of 
Customer Positions would not be 
available to address losses on 
Proprietary Positions. However, the 
definition of ‘‘Other VM Gains’’ would 
be modified to make clear that, if there 
were Cross-Margin VM Gains in relation 
to Proprietary Positions at a time when 
the Clearing Organization with those 
Cross-Margin VM Gains also had losses 
on account of Customer Positions, the 
VM Gains may first be applied to satisfy 
the losses on the Customer Positions 
before being remitted to the other 
Clearing Organization.
40
 
Although the Clearing Organizations 
would generally close-out and net the 
Liquidation Portfolios of a Defaulting 
Member separately, Section 7(a) of the 
Third A&R Agreement would provide 
that the decision as to whether to 
commence the liquidation process with 
respect to a Joint Clearing Member 
would be made based on the Joint 
Clearing Member itself, rather than a 
particular Liquidation Portfolio. In 
accordance with this framework, 
Section 7(a) of the Third A&R 
Agreement would provide that if one 
Clearing Organization decides not to 
take default action against a Defaulting 
Member following a Default Event (the 
‘‘Non-Liquidating CO’’), the Non- 
Liquidating CO shall immediately 
require the Defaulting Member to pay 
the Non-Liquidating CO in immediately 
available funds the sum of (x) its Margin 
Reduction at the other Clearing 
Organization for all Combined Portfolios 
of the Defaulting Member, and (y) its 
Margin Reduction at the Non- 
Liquidating CO for all Combined 
Portfolios of the Defaulting Member, 
within one hour of demand.
41
 
E. Conforming Changes 
The Third A&R Agreement would also 
include a number of conforming 
changes in light of the addition of the 
Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement. These would include new 
recitals which describe the purpose of 
the Third A&R Agreement as to 
establish the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, introduce defined terms

See Section 1 of the proposed Third A&R Agreement; see, e.g., Section 3(c) of the proposed Third A&R Agreement (updating references to 
‘‘Cross-Margining Account(s)’’ to refer to 
‘‘Proprietary Cross-Margining Account(s)’’); Section 
7(a) of the proposed Third A&R Agreement 
(updating a reference to ‘‘Eligible Affiliates’’ to refer 
to ‘‘Eligible Affiliates or Customers’’).

Arrangement’’ and ‘‘Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement,’’ and define 
the prior versions of the agreement as 
the ‘‘Original Agreement,’’ the ‘‘First 
A&R Agreement,’’ and the ‘‘Second A&R 
Agreement.’’ They would also include 
non-substantive revisions and 
movements of defined terms as shown 
in Exhibit 5 to conform to the addition 
of the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement and the provisions 
described above.
42
 
The Third A&R Agreement would also 
revise Section 3(b), which sets out 
certain requirements applicable to 
positions of Eligible Affiliates, to 
provide that it does not apply to 
Proprietary Positions of a Joint Clearing 
Member or to Customer Positions.
43
 
In addition, the Third A&R Agreement 
would revise Section 7(i) to clarify that 
the requirement for a Defaulting 
Member to reimburse a Clearing 
Organization in the event that the 
Clearing Organization is obligated to 
make a guaranty payment to the other 
Clearing Organization in respect of an 
obligation of such Defaulting Member 
applies in respect of the obligations of 
any Cross-Margining Customer.
44
 
F. Clarifying Edits 
The Third A&R Agreement would also 
include a number of clarifying edits not 
specifically related to the Customer 
Cross-Margining Arrangement. 
Specifically, Section 2(f) of the Third 
A&R Agreement would specify that 
FICC or CME may terminate the 
participation of a particular Cross- 
Margining Participant with respect to 
some or all Cross-Margining Accounts of 
the Cross-Margining Participant upon 
two business days’ prior written notice 
to the other Clearing Organization, 
provided that no such termination 
would be effective with respect to any 
reimbursement obligation or guaranty 
with respect to such Cross-Margining 
Participant that was incurred prior to 
such termination, or with respect to 
Section 7 of the Third A&R Agreement 
until the Stand-Alone Margin 
Requirement with respect to each Cross- 
Margining Account subject to such 
termination has been fully satisfied.
45
 
The Third A&R Agreement would also 
include a new Section 5 to make clear 
that, as is currently the case, the 
collateral acceptable to satisfy the Cross- 
Margin Requirement must meet the 
respective eligibility requirements of the 
Clearing Organization to which the 
collateral is posted.
46
 
In addition, the titles of the 
Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Agreements in Appendix A and 
Appendix B of the Third A&R 
Agreement would be amended to 
specify that they are for use in 
connection with the Proprietary Cross- 
Margining Arrangement.
47
 
G. Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement 
As described above, an Eligible BD– 
FCM would be required to enter into the 
Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement in order to 
participate in the Customer Cross- 
Margining Agreement. The Customer 
Cross-Margining Clearing Member 
Agreement would be set forth in 
Appendix C to the Third A&R 
Agreement.
48
 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement would be 
modeled on the Proprietary Clearing 
Member Agreement in Appendix A of 
the Second A&R Agreement (the 
‘‘Existing Joint Clearing Member 
Proprietary Clearing Member 
Agreement’’), with changes designed to 
facilitate compliance with the 
conditions in the Proposed Orders and 
to clarify the rights and obligations of 
the Clearing Organizations, the Eligible 
BD–FCM, and the Cross-Margining 
Customers.
49
 
The first three paragraphs of the 
Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement would be 
substantially identical to those of the 
Existing Joint Clearing Member 
Proprietary Clearing Member 
Agreement, except that the first 
paragraph would note that the Eligible 
BD–FCM is electing to become a Cross- 
Margining Participant for purposes of 
the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, rather than the Cross- 
Margining Arrangement generally, and 
the third paragraph (concerning the 
Eligible BD–FCM’s payment obligations) 
would reference the payment 
obligations arising in respect of 
Customer Cross-Margining Accounts. 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement would 
provide that the Eligible BD–FCM 
makes application to the Clearing 
Organizations to establish a Customer 
Cross-Margining Account at CME and 
one or more Customer Cross-Margining 
Accounts at FICC in the name of the 
Eligible BD–FCM, and clarify that each 
such account would be in addition to 
any Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Account of the Eligible BD–FCM 
established pursuant to the Third A&R 
Agreement. The Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing Member Agreement 
would provide that each Customer 
Cross-Margining Account shall be 
limited to transactions and positions 
carried by the Eligible BD–FCM for 
Cross-Margining Customers who have 
signed a Customer Agreement. The 
Eligible BD–FCM would be required to 
agree that it shall not commence 
clearing transactions through or carrying 
positions in a Customer Cross- 
Margining Account for any Cross- 
Margining Customer until such Cross- 
Margining Customer has executed a 
Customer Agreement. 
The Eligible BD–FCM would be 
required under the Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing Member Agreement 
to indemnify and hold harmless the 
Clearing Organizations, their respective 
directors, officers and employees and 
each person, if any, who controls either 
of the Clearing Organizations against 
any claims, losses, liabilities and 
expenses, including, without limitation, 
reasonable legal fees and expenses and 
amounts paid or payable in settlement 
of any action, proceeding or 
investigation arising from any claim by 
any party resulting from the carrying of 
positions in a Customer Cross- 
Margining Account that belong to any 
person other than a Cross-Margining 
Customer for whom a Customer 
Agreement is in effect. 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement would 
provide that the Eligible BD–FCM, as 
agent for each of its Cross-Margining 
Customers, (i) unconditionally promises 
immediate payment of any payment or 
reimbursement obligations to a Clearing 
Organization arising under the Third

A&R Agreement. 
A&R Agreement or the GSD Rules or 
rules of CME in respect of a Cross- 
Margining Customer’s positions in a 
Customer Cross-Margining Account, and 
(ii) agrees that each Cross-Margining 
Customer is bound by the GSD Rules 
and the rules of CME as applicable to 
them and by the provisions of the 
Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement and the Third A&R 
Agreement. The Eligible BD–FCM 
would also be required to represent and 
warrant to the Clearing Organizations 
that it has full power and authority to 
bind each of its Cross-Margining 
Customers to the terms in the foregoing 
sentence. 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement would also 
provide for the Eligible BD–FCM to 
pledge, as security for its and its Cross- 
Margining Customers’ present and 
future payment and reimbursement 
obligations to FICC and CME arising 
from its Customer Cross-Margining 
Accounts or otherwise under the 
Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement on behalf of itself 
and each Cross-Margining Customer, 
and grant to each Clearing Organization 
a first priority continuing security 
interest in, lien on and right of set-off 
against all of the positions, margin 
deposits or other property held by or 
subject to the control of or owing from 
either Clearing Organization including 
any and all Net Gains in respect of the 
Eligible BD–FCM’s Customer Cross- 
Margining Accounts and the proceeds in 
respect thereof. 
The Eligible BD–FCM would also 
provide for the Eligible BD–FCM to 
agree that (i) the rights of each Clearing 
Organization set forth in the preceding 
paragraph are in addition to any other 
rights arising out of the NYUCC or other 
statute, common law, or governmental 
regulation, or under their respective 
rules, (ii) the Eligible BD–FCM will 
execute, deliver, file and record any 
financing statement, specific assignment 
or other document and take any other 
action necessary or desirable and 
reasonably requested by FICC or CME to 
create, preserve, perfect or validate the 
security interest or lien granted in this 
paragraph, to enable such Clearing 
Organization to exercise or enforce its 
rights, (iii) the Eligible BD–FCM will 
promptly give notice to the Clearing 
Organizations of, and defend against, 
any suit, action, proceeding or lien that 
involves or could adversely affect the 
security interest and lien granted by the 
Eligible BD–FCM, and (iv) the Eligible 
BD–FCM authorizes FICC to comply 
with CME’s entitlement orders with 
respect to any Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin pursuant to the Third 
A&R Agreement without further consent 
of the Eligible BD–FCM or Cross- 
Margining Customer for whom such 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin is 
held. Clauses (i) through (iii) broadly 
align with the Existing Joint Clearing 
Member Proprietary Clearing Member 
Agreement, while clause (iv) would be 
designed to facilitate the perfection of 
CME’s security interest in the Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin and help 
ensure that Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin is treated as ‘‘customer 
property’’ under Part 190 of the CFTC’s 
regulations, as described in the 
Petitions. 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement would 
contain the same provision regarding 
the disclosure of Clearing Data as in the 
Existing Joint Clearing Member 
Proprietary Clearing Member 
Agreement. Consistently with the 
Existing Joint Clearing Member 
Proprietary Clearing Member 
Agreement, it would also provide that 
neither FICC nor CME guarantees to the 
Eligible BD–FCM that the calculation of 
the margin reduction for a Combined 
Portfolio pursuant to the Third A&R 
Agreement will yield any, or the highest 
possible, margin reduction for the 
Combined Portfolio. The Customer 
Cross-Margining Clearing Member 
Agreement would also, as in the 
Existing Joint Clearing Member 
Proprietary Clearing Member 
Agreement, provide that, without 
limiting any provision of the GSD Rules, 
the rules of CME or any other agreement 
between the Eligible BD–FCM and FICC 
or CME, any transfer by the Eligible BD– 
FCM or any Cross-Margining Customer 
of any rights it may have in the Net Gain 
(or any component thereof) shall be null 
and void and, in any event, subject to 
the prior payment in full of all payment 
and reimbursement obligations under 
the Third A&R Agreement. The 
Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement would contain the 
same representations as the Existing 
Joint Clearing Member Proprietary 
Clearing Member Agreement, except 
those concerning the proprietary nature 
of the positions and Eligible Affiliates. 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement would 
specify that the Eligible BD–FCM may 
terminate the Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement upon two 
business day’s written notice to FICC 
and CME, and that such termination 
shall be effective upon written 
acknowledgement by both FICC and 
CME provided that (i) all positions in 
the Customer Cross-Margining Accounts 
have been closed-out or transferred to 
other accounts in accordance with the 
GSD Rules or the rules of CME, and (ii) 
all Stand-alone Margin Requirement in 
respect of any such transferred positions 
and all obligations of the Eligible BD– 
FCM to the Clearing Organizations in 
respect of the Customer Cross-Margining 
Accounts have been fully satisfied. 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement would also 
specify that either Clearing Organization 
may terminate the Eligible BD–FCM’s 
participation with respect to any 
Customer Cross-Margining Account 
(defined as an ‘‘Affected Customer 
Cross-Margining Account’’) of the 
Eligible BD–FCM at any time upon 
written notice to the other Clearing 
Organization pursuant to the Third A&R 
Agreement and to the Eligible BD–FCM. 
In connection with such termination, 
the Clearing Organizations would be 
permitted to require the Eligible BD– 
FCM to close-out or transfer all 
positions in the Affected Customer 
Cross-Margining Accounts in 
accordance with the GSD Rules or the 
rules of CME, and the Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing Member Agreement 
would thereupon terminate with respect 
to Affected Customer Cross-Margining 
Accounts, provided that the Stand-alone 
Margin Requirement in respect of the 
transferred positions and all obligations 
of the Eligible BD–FCM to the Clearing 
Organizations in respect of the Affected 
Customer Cross-Margining Accounts 
have been fully satisfied. 
The Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement would also 
include the same governing law, choice- 
of-jurisdiction, and execution in 
counterparts provisions as the Existing 
Joint Clearing Member Proprietary 
Clearing Member Agreement. The 
Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement would also provide 
that it would become effective upon the 
later of execution of the Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing Member Agreement, 
or on the receipt of all necessary 
regulatory approvals from the 
Commission and the CFTC. 
H. Customer Agreement 
The Customer Agreement would 
include the terms of the Subordination 
Agreement and acknowledgements 
corresponding to the disclosures 
required by the Proposed Orders.

In 
particular, the Customer Agreement 
would require the Cross-Margining 
Customer to acknowledge and agree 
that:

the Cross-Margining Customer agrees 
that all of its Customer Positions and 
Customer Property (including any 
margin at FICC) (i) will not receive 
customer treatment under the Exchange 
Act or SIPA or be treated as ‘‘customer 
property’’ as defined in 11 U.S.C. 741 in 
a liquidation of Clearing Member, and 
(ii) will be subject to any applicable 
protections under Subchapter IV of 
Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code 
and rules and regulations thereunder 
including Part 190 of the CFTC’s 
Regulations (‘‘Part 190’’), and that the 
Cross-Margining Customer’s claims to 
‘‘customer property’’ as defined in SIPA 
or 11 U.S.C. 741 against the Eligible BD– 
FCM with respect to its Customer 
Positions and Customer Property 
(including any margin held at FICC) will 
be subordinated to the claims of all 
other customers, as the term ‘‘customer’’ 
is defined in 11 U.S.C. 741 or SIPA;

€all money, securities and property deposited with the Eligible BD–FCM by 
the Cross-Margining Customer to 
margin, guarantee or secure Customer 
Positions (the ‘‘Customer Property’’)

defined in CFTC Regulation 1.3 and 
subject to CEA Section 4d(a) and (b);
52
 
€its Customer Positions and associated margin may be commingled 
with the positions and property of other 
customers of the Eligible BD–FCM and 
may be used by the Eligible BD–FCM to 
purchase, margin, secure, settle, or

the Cross-Margining Customer or other 
futures customers of the Eligible BD– 
FCM;
53
 
€property held in connection with Customer Positions will be treated in a 
manner consistent with the CFTC Order 
and that such property held on the 
Cross-Margining Customer’s behalf by

accounted for, treated and dealt with by 
such FCM in a manner consistent with 
Section 4d of the CEA;

€in the event a Clearing Organization suspends or ceases to act for Clearing 
Member, it shall be within the sole 
discretion of the Clearing Organizations

Margining Account;
55
 
€its participation in the Customer Cross-Margining Arrangement is subject 
to the terms of (i) the Third A&R 
Agreement, (ii) the Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing Member Agreement, 
and (iii) the GSD Rules and the rules of 
CME;
56
and 
€if CME determines at any time that any Eligible Positions of the Cross- 
Margining Customer cleared through the 
Customer Cross-Margining Account at 
CME are non-risk reducing, CME may 
either restrict the Cross-Margining 
Customer from adding positions or 
require the Cross-Margining Customer to 
move or liquidate Eligible Positions in 
the Customer Cross-Margining Account 
at CME;
57
 
The Customer Agreement would also 
require the Cross-Margining Customer to 
pledge, as security for the Cross- 
Margining Customer’s present and 
future payment and delivery obligations 
in respect of its Customer Positions 
(including, without limitation, any 
obligation of the Cross-Margining 
Customer to reimburse the Eligible BD– 
FCM as a result of the Eligible BD– 
FCM’s performance of such obligations), 
and grant to the Eligible BD–FCM a 
continuing security interest in, lien on 
and right of set-off against its right, 
entitlement, and interest in all of 
positions in each Customer Cross- 
Margining Account, all margin posted 
by the Cross-Margining Customer in 
connection with such positions, and the 
proceeds in respect thereof.
58
The 
Customer Agreement would also require 
the Cross-Margining Customer to agree 
that the Eligible BD–FCM may enter into 
agreements with the Clearing 
Organizations on the Cross-Margining 
Customer’s behalf as set forth in the 
Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement.
59
 
(ii) Other Proposed Changes to the GSD 
Rules 
A. Overview 
FICC is proposing to make a number 
of changes to the GSD Rules to 
effectuate the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement. 
First, FICC proposes to create a new 
position Account type, the ‘‘Cross- 
Margining Customer Account,’’ in 
which Customer Positions would be 
recorded. The Cross-Margining 
Customer Account would constitute an 
‘‘Indirect Participants Account.’’ A 
Netting Member that is an Eligible BD– 
FCM and approved participant in the 
Customer Cross-Margining Arrangement 
would be permitted to designate an 
Indirect Participants Account (other 
than a Segregated Indirect Participants 
Account) as a Cross-Margining 
Customer Account.
60
Any such 
designation would constitute a 
representation to FICC by the Netting 
Member that the Netting Member has 
complied with all regulatory 
requirements applicable to it in 
connection with its participation in the 
Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, including the conditions 
in the Proposed Orders, and this 
representation would be deemed 
repeated each time the Netting Member 
deposits Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin. 
Second, FICC proposes to adopt rule 
changes to set forth how FICC would 
calculate, collect, and hold margin for 
positions recorded in a Cross-Margining 
Customer Account. As noted above, 
FICC proposes to collect and hold Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin pursuant to 
substantially similar provisions as apply 
to Segregated Customer Margin, with 
certain modifications to satisfy the 
requirements of the Proposed Orders 
and align with the treatment of futures 
margin. Specifically: 
€Consistent with Segregated Customer Margin and in accordance 
with the Proposed Orders, FICC would 
credit all Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin deposited by a Netting Member 
to a ‘‘securities account,’’ as defined in 
the NYUCC,
61
on its books and records 
maintained for that Netting Member for 
the benefit of its Cross-Margining 
Customers (i.e., a Cross-Margining Customer Margin Custody Account). 
The GSD Rules would further provide 
that all cash and securities credited to 
the Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Custody Account shall be treated as 
‘‘financial assets’’ within the meaning of 
Article 8 of the NYUCC, New York shall 
be the ‘‘securities intermediary’s 
jurisdiction’’ for purposes of the NYUCC 
and New York law shall govern all 
issues specified in Article 2(1) of the 
Hague Securities Convention.
62
Such 
provisions are designed to ensure the 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
would not form part of FICC’s estate in 
the event FICC became subject to 
insolvency proceedings. They would 
also facilitate the ability of CME to 
perfect its security interest in the Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin. Such

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60800 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices 63
We note that in this regard, unlike Segregated 
Customer Margin, FICC would be able to use all 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin to satisfy the 
obligations arising from all Customer Positions 
recorded in the same Cross-margining Customer 
Account, even if such Customer Positions are not 
the particular ones of the individual Cross- 
Margining Customer that posted such margin. This 
treatment would be consistent with how futures 
customer margin is generally treated. 
64
See Self-Regulatory Organizations; Fixed Income Clearing Corporation; Order Approving 
Proposed Rule Change To Expand the One-Pot 
Cross-Margining Program With New York Portfolio 
Clearing, LLC to Certain ‘‘Market Professionals,’’ 77 
FR 30032 (May 21, 2012). 
perfection would serve to protect CME, 
and in turn both the Cross-Margining 
Customers and the non-participating 
futures customers in the event of a 
Cross-Margining Participant default. It 
would also aim to ensure that the Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin is treated as 
‘‘customer property’’ under Part 190 in 
the event of an Eligible BD–FCM’s 
insolvency, by helping to establish that 
the Cross-Margining Customer Margin is 
held to secure the futures positions of 
customers. 
€In accordance with the Proposed Orders, FICC would hold Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin in (i) an 
account of FICC at a bank insured by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(‘‘FDIC’’) that is segregated from any 
other account of FICC and used 
exclusively to hold Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin, and (ii) an account at 
the FRBNY that is segregated from any 
other account of FICC and used 
exclusively to hold Segregated Customer 
Margin and Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin. The GSD Rules would provide 
that any such account (other than one at 
the FRBNY) would need to be subject to 
a written notice consistent with the 
Proposed Orders. 
€The same requirements applicable to Segregated Customer Margin with 
respect to the form and composition of 
eligible collateral, the minimum 
amounts of cash and Eligible Clearing 
Fund Treasury Securities, substitution 
and withdrawal, and treatment of excess 
margin would be applicable to Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin, except that 
(i) a Netting Member’s rights or FICC’s 
obligation with respect to any excess 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
would be subject to the Third A&R 
Agreement and the Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing Member Agreement, 
and (ii) FICC would be permitted to 
retain the excess Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin deposited by a Netting 
Member with respect to a Cross- 
Margining Customer when the Netting 
Member has any outstanding payment 
or margin obligation arising from any 
Customer Positions, including those of 
another Cross-Margining Customer. 
With regard to calculation, FICC 
proposes that, as with Segregated 
Customer Margin and in accordance 
with the requirements of the Proposed 
Orders, FICC would calculate the 
margin requirement in respect of each 
Cross-Margining Customer Account (the 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement’’) on a gross (i.e., Cross- Margining Customer-by-Cross- 
Margining Customer) basis, as though 
each Cross-Margining Customer were a 
separate Netting Member. However, 
such margin requirement would be 
subject to any margin reduction 
pursuant to the Third A&R Agreement 
(which, as discussed above, would be 
determined using the same margin 
reduction methodology under 
Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement). 
Third, FICC proposes to provide that 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
would be pledged to FICC to secure all 
obligations of the Netting Member and 
its Cross-Margining Customers arising 
under Customer Positions.
63
 
Fourth, FICC proposes to remove the 
existing Section 10(e) of Rule 3A, which 
currently prohibits Sponsored Members 
from participating in the Cross- 
Margining Arrangement. 
Fifth, FICC proposes to make 
conforming changes to Rule 43, which 
sets out the terms related to Cross- 
Margining Arrangements, so that the 
Rule encompasses the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement. In particular, 
FICC proposes to specify in Rule 43 that 
a Netting Member that is an Eligible 
BD–FCM may become a Cross- 
Margining Participant in connection 
with the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement with the consent of FICC 
and CME. An Eligible BD–FCM would 
become such a Cross-Margining 
Participant and be permitted to establish 
a Cross-Margining Customer Account 
upon acceptance by FICC and CME of 
an executed Customer Cross-Margining 
Clearing Member Agreement. FICC 
further proposes to make clear that if 
FICC becomes obligated to make a 
payment to CME pursuant to the cross- 
guaranty under the Third A&R 
Agreement in relation to the obligations 
of a Cross-Margining Customer, both the 
Cross-Margining Customer and the 
relevant Eligible BD–FCM would be 
responsible for the reimbursement 
obligation that is owed to FICC as a 
result. If FICC receives a payment from 
CME pursuant to the Third A&R 
Agreement in connection with the 
Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, FICC would not be 
permitted to apply such payment to any 
obligation other than the obligations of 
Cross-Margining Customers (whether or 
not arising in connection with any 
Eligible Positions). 
Lastly, FICC proposes to remove 
provisions relating to ‘‘Market 
Professional’’ and ‘‘Market Professional 
Agreement for Cross-Margining’’ from 
the GSD Rules. Those provisions were 
adopted in connection with a ‘‘market 
professional’’ cross-margining program 
between FICC and New York Portfolio 
Clearing, LLC.
64
That program—which 
permitted certain ‘‘market professional’’ 
customers of Netting Members to 
participant in cross-margining—is no 
longer active as New York Portfolio 
Clearing, LLC has since become defunct. 
B. Summary of Proposed Rule Changes 
To effectuate the proposed changes 
described above, FICC proposes to make 
the following amendments to its Rules. 
New Defined Terms. FICC would 
revise Rule 1 to add the following new 
defined terms: (1) ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Customer,’’ (2) ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Customer Account,’’ (3) ‘‘Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin Custody 
Account,’’ (4) ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin,’’ (5) ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin Requirement,’’ and (6) 
‘‘Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement.’’ 
The term ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Customer’’ would mean a Sponsored 
Member or Executing Firm Customer 
whose Transactions are recorded in a 
Cross-Margining Customer Account. 
The term ‘‘Cross-Margining Customer 
Account’’ would mean an Indirect 
Participants Account maintained by 
FICC for a Sponsoring Member or an 
Agent Clearing Member that has been 
designated pursuant to Rule 2B for 
purposes of recording Transactions of 
Cross-Margining Customers. 
The term ‘‘Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin Custody Account’’ would mean 
a securities account within the meaning 
of the NYUCC maintained by FICC, in 
its capacity as securities intermediary as 
such term is used in the NYUCC, for an 
Agent Clearing Member or Sponsoring 
Member for the benefit of such 
Member’s Cross-Margining Customers. 
The term ‘‘Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin’’ would mean all securities and 
funds deposited by a Sponsoring 
Member or an Agent Clearing Member 
with FICC to satisfy its Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin Requirement. 
The term ‘‘Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin Requirement’’ would mean the 
amount of cash or Eligible Clearing 
Fund Securities that an Agent Clearing 
Member or Sponsoring Member is 
required to deposit with FICC to support 
the obligations arising from 
Transactions recorded in its Cross-

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60801 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices Margining Customer Accounts. 
Specifically, a Netting Member’s Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement would be the amount of 
the item listed in Section 2(a)(vii) of 
Rule 4 (as described below). This 
definition would specify that references 
to the Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement ‘‘for’’ or ‘‘with respect to’’ 
a particular Cross-Margining Customer 
Account or Cross-Margining Customer 
(or similar language) would mean the 
portion of a Netting Member’s Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement arising from such Account 
or Cross-Margining Customer. 
The term ‘‘Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement’’ would mean a Cross- 
Margining Arrangement pursuant to 
which a Cross-Margining Participant, at 
the discretion of FICC and in 
accordance with the provisions of Rule 
43, may elect to have any of its Cross- 
Margining Customers’ margin 
requirement in respect of Eligible 
Positions at FICC and such Cross- 
Margining Customer’s margin 
requirements in respect of Eligible 
Positions at a clearing organization for 
a board of trade designated as a contract 
market under Section 5 of the CEA that 
has entered into a Cross-Margining 
Agreement with FICC (an ‘‘FCO’’) 
calculated by taking into consideration 
the net risk of such Eligible Positions at 
each of the clearing organizations. 
Revisions to Defined Terms. In 
addition, FICC would make conforming 
revisions to the following defined terms 
in Rule 1: (1) ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Affiliate,’’ (2) ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Agreement’’ (3) ‘‘Current Net Settlement 
Positions,’’ (4) ‘‘Indirect Participants 
Account,’’ and (5) ‘‘Type of Account’’ 
and ‘‘Type.’’ 
FICC proposes to amend the 
definition to ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Affiliate’’ to remove existing prong (ii), 
which relates to the ‘‘market 
professional’’ cross-margining program. 
FICC proposes to amend the 
definition to ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Agreement’’ to encompass the Customer 
Cross-Margining Arrangement by 
specifying that the applicable Cross- 
Margining Participant may have any of 
its Cross-Margining Customers’ margin 
requirement in respect of Eligible 
Positions at FICC and such Cross- 
Margining Customer’s margin 
requirements in respect of Eligible 
Positions at a relevant FCO calculated 
by taking into consideration the net risk 
of such Eligible Positions at each of the 
clearing organizations. FICC also 
proposes to remove the last sentence of 
this definition, which relates to the 
‘‘market professional’’ cross-margining 
program. 
FICC proposes to make conforming 
edits to the definition of ‘‘Current Net 
Settlement Positions’’ to add references 
to ‘‘Cross-Margining Customer,’’ ‘‘Cross- 
Margining Customer Account,’’ and 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement’’ after each reference to 
‘‘Segregated Indirect Participant,’’ 
‘‘Segregated Indirect Participants 
Account,’’ and ‘‘Segregated Customer 
Margin Requirement,’’ respectively. 
FICC proposes to amend the 
definitions of ‘‘Indirect Participants 
Account,’’ ‘‘Type of Account’’ and 
‘‘Type’’ to include a Cross-Margining 
Customer Account. 
Removal of defined terms. FICC 
proposes to remove the following 
defined terms from Rule 1: (1) ‘‘Market 
Professional’’ and (2) ‘‘Market 
Professional Agreement for Cross- 
Margining.’’ 
Establishment of Cross-Margining 
Customer Accounts. FICC proposes to amend Section 3 of Rule 2B to provide 
that a Cross-Margining Customer 
Account may not be designated as a 
Segregated Indirect Participants 
Account. 
In addition, FICC proposes to add a 
new Section 3a of Rule 2B to provide 
that (i) a Netting Member that is an 
Eligible BD–FCM and has been 
approved to become a Cross-Margining 
Participant in a Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement pursuant to a 
Cross-Margining Agreement may 
designate any of its Indirect Participants 
Accounts (other than a Segregated 
Indirect Participants Account) as a 
Cross-Margining Customer Account; (ii) 
any such designation of an Account 
shall constitute a representation to FICC 
by the Netting Member that the Netting 
Member has complied with all 
regulatory requirements applicable to it 
in connection with its participation in 
the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, including the conditions 
in the Proposed Orders; and (iii) the 
Netting Member shall be deemed to 
repeat this representation each time it 
deposits Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin. 
Treatment of Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin. FICC proposes to 
make the following changes in relation 
to FICC’s calculation, collection, and 
holding of Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin: 
FICC proposes to amend Section 1a of 
Rule 4 to make clear that FICC’s account 
at the FRBNY that is currently used to 
hold Segregated Customer Margin 
would also hold Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin. 
FICC proposes to renumber current 
Section 1b of Rule 4 to Section 1c and 
add a new Section 1b. The new Section 
1b would provide that: 
€Each Netting Member shall deposit Cross-Margining Customer Margin with 
FICC in an amount equal to its Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement, which requirement shall 
be determined in accordance with Rule 
4 and the Margin Component Schedule. 
The timing of the satisfaction of the 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement shall be determined in 
accordance with the provisions of 
Section 9 of Rule 4. 
€FICC shall establish and maintain on its books and records a Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin Custody 
Account to which all Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin deposited with FICC 
shall be credited. The Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin credited to a Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin Custody 
Account shall be used exclusively to 
secure the present and future payment 
and reimbursement obligations of the 
Netting Member and its Cross-Margining 
Customers in relation to Eligible 
Positions of the Netting Member’s Cross- 
Margining Customers at FICC and CME. 
€All assets credited to each Cross- Margining Customer Margin Custody 
Account shall be treated as ‘‘financial 
assets’’ within the meaning of Article 8 
of the NYUCC. New York is the 
‘‘securities intermediary’s jurisdiction’’ 
for purposes of the NYUCC and New 
York law shall govern all issues 
specified in Article 2(1) of the Hague 
Securities Convention. 
€FICC shall hold all Cross-Margining Customer Margin in an account of FICC 
at an FDIC-insured bank within the 
meaning of the Exchange Act that is a 
qualified custodian under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940, as 
amended, or at the FRBNY. Any account 
at an FDIC-insured bank shall be 
segregated from any other account of 
FICC and shall be used exclusively to 
hold Cross-Margining Customer Margin, 
and shall be subject to a written notice 
of the bank provided to and retained by 
FICC consistent with the Proposed 
Orders. The account at the FRBNY shall 
be segregated from any other account of 
FICC and shall be used exclusively to 
hold Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
and Segregated Customer Margin (the 
account at the FRBNY would not be 
subject to a written notice). 
FICC proposes to amend current 
Section 1b (to be renumbered as Section 
1c) of Rule 4 to (i) add references to 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Accounts’’ 
after references to ‘‘Segregated Indirect 
Participants Accounts’’ in current 
Section 1b(a), and (ii) add a new 
sentence at the end of current Section 
1b(b) to provide that FICC would

Margin Requirement for a Cross- 
Margining Customer Account as the 
sum of the requirements applicable to 
each Cross-Margining Customer whose 
Transactions are recorded in such 
Account, as though each such Cross- 
Margining Customer were a separate 
Netting Member with a single Margin 
Portfolio consisting of such 
Transactions, in accordance with the 
Margin Component Schedule. 
FICC proposes to amend Section 2 of 
Rule 4 by (i) adding references to 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement’’ after references to 
‘‘Segregated Customer Margin 
Requirement’’ in the title of Section 2 
and Section 2(a), and (ii) adding a new 
clause (vii) of Section 2(a) to specify 
that the Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin Requirement would be an 
amount calculated with respect to the 
Netting Member’s Cross-Margining 
Customer Accounts. 
FICC proposes to add a new Section 
2c of Rule 4 entitled ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin Requirement’’ to 
provide that (i) each Netting Member 
shall deposit any Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin with FICC by the 
Required Fund Deposit Deadline 
through a separate Deposit ID 
established by the Netting Member for 
each Cross-Margining Customer 
Account, and (ii) FICC shall report the 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirements to each Netting Member 
twice daily in a Report which shall 
specify the Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin Requirement for each Cross- 
Margining Customer Account. 
FICC proposes to add a new Section 
3(d) of Rule 4 and insert it before the 
last sentence of Section 3. The new 
Section 3(d) would provide that each 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement for a particular Cross- 
Margining Customer Account would be 
subject to the requirements that (i) a 
minimum of 40 percent of the Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement for such Account shall be 
satisfied with cash and/or Eligible 
Clearing Fund Treasury Securities, and 
(ii) a minimum of the product of $1 
million and the number of Cross- 
Margining Customers whose 
Transactions are recorded in such Cross- 
Margining Account must be made and 
maintained in cash. In addition, FICC 
proposes to amend the last sentence of 
Section 3 by adding a reference to 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement’’ after the reference to 
‘‘Segregated Indirect Participants 
Requirement.’’ 
FICC proposes to amend Section 3a of 
Rule 4 to add a reference to ‘‘Cross- 
Margining Customers’’ after the 
reference to ‘‘Segregated Indirect 
Participants.’’ FICC also proposes to 
amend Section 3b of Rule 4 to add a 
reference to ‘‘Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin Custody Account’’ after the 
reference to ‘‘Segregated Customer 
Margin Custody Account.’’ 
FICC proposes to amend Sections 3a, 
3b, and 9 of Rule 4 to add references to 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin,’’ 
after each reference to ‘‘Segregated 
Customer Margin.’’ FICC also proposes 
to amend Sections 3b and 9 of Rule 4 
to add references to ‘‘Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin Requirement,’’ after 
each reference to ‘‘Segregated Customer 
Margin Requirement.’’ 
FICC proposes to add a new Section 
4(c) of Rule 4 to provide that (i) as 
security for any and all obligations and 
liabilities of a Netting Member and any 
of its Cross-Margining Customers to 
FICC arising out of or in connection 
with any Cross-Margining Customer 
Accounts of such Netting Member or 
Transactions recorded therein, each 
such Netting Member on behalf of itself 
and its Cross-Margining Customers 
grants to FICC a first priority perfected 
security interest in its right, title and 
interest in and to all Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin, each Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin Custody Account, and 
all distributions thereon and proceeds 
thereof, and (ii) FICC shall be entitled to 
exercise the rights of a pledgee under 
common law and a secured party under 
Articles 8 and 9 of the NYUCC with 
respect to such assets. 
FICC proposes to amend Section 5 of 
Rule 4 by (i) adding a reference to 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin’’ 
after the reference to ‘‘Segregated 
Customer Margin’’ in the title of Section 
5, and (ii) adding a new paragraph at the 
end of Section 5 to provide that FICC 
shall only use Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin deposited by a Netting 
Member to (A) secure the Transactions 
of Cross-Margining Customers of such 
Netting Member recorded in any Cross- 
Margining Customer Account and 
satisfy payment and delivery obligations 
owing to FICC (including liquidating or 
otherwise using such Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin to obtain relevant cash 
or securities) in connection with a 
default in respect of such Transactions; 
and (B) for investment in U.S. Treasury 
securities with a maturity of one year or 
less. 
FICC proposes to amend Section 10 of 
Rule 4 by (i) adding a reference to 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin’’ 
after the reference to ‘‘Segregated 
Customer Margin’’ in the title of Section 
10, (ii) amending the first paragraph of 
Section 10 to require FICC to separately 
determine whether the amount of Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin supporting 
a Cross-Margining Customer’s 
Transactions is in excess of the Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement for such Cross-Margining 
Customer (‘‘Excess Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin’’), and (iii) adding a 
new Section 10(c) to provide that upon 
a Member’s request, and in accordance 
with such procedures as FICC may set 
forth from time to time, the Corporation 
shall return to the Member its Excess 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin, 
subject to the minimum amount of cash 
or Eligible Clearing Fund Securities 
required to be maintained pursuant to 
the GSD Rules (valued at their collateral 
value on the day of such withdrawal) 
and the terms of the Third A&R 
Agreement and Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing Member Agreement, 
as the Member requests, provided that, 
subject to the Third A&R Agreement and 
the Customer Cross-Margining Clearing 
Member Agreement, and except to the 
extent required by applicable law or 
authorized by the Commission, FICC 
shall not retain Excess Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin due to any obligations 
of the Member unrelated to a Cross- 
Margining Customer Account of such 
Member. Section 10(c) of Rule 4 would 
further provide that FICC may, at its 
discretion, retain some or all of the 
Excess Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin if the Member has an 
outstanding payment or margin 
obligation to the Corporation with 
respect to the Transactions of any Cross- 
Margining Customer. 
FICC proposes to amend the Margin 
Component Schedule to set out how 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirements would be determined. 
Specifically, FICC proposes to insert a 
new paragraph at the end of Section 1 
to provide that (i) on each Business Day, 
each Netting Member for which FICC 
maintains a Cross-Margining Customer 
Account shall be required to deposit 
with FICC Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin equal to the sum of all Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin 
Requirements for all such Accounts, (ii) 
each Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement shall equal the sum of the 
amounts calculated pursuant to Section 
3a of the Margin Component Schedule 
for each Cross-Margining Customer 
whose Transactions are recorded in the 
relevant Cross-Margining Customer 
Account, and (iii) each such calculation 
shall be performed twice daily or on a 
more frequent basis if FICC deems it 
appropriate pursuant to the Margin 
Component Schedule and subject to the 
provisions of Rule 4. Further, FICC

See UCC § 8–503(a) (‘‘To the extent necessary for a securities intermediary to satisfy all security 
entitlements with respect to a particular financial 
asset, all interests in that financial asset held by the 
securities intermediary are held by the securities 
intermediary for the entitlement holders, are not 
property of the securities intermediary, and are not 
subject to claims of creditors of the securities 
intermediary, except as otherwise provided in 
Section 8–511’’). The exceptions to the foregoing 
rule in Section 8–511 only apply in the event that 
the securities intermediary has pledged the 
financial assets underlying the security entitlements 
to creditors, which would not be relevant here. See 
UCC § 8–511(b)–(c). 
proposes to add a new Section 3a to the 
Margin Component Schedule titled 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement Calculations’’ to set out 
how specifically such requirement 
would be calculated, which would be 
substantially identical to how 
Segregated Customer Margin 
Requirement is calculated as set out in 
Section 3 of the Margin Component 
Schedule. Finally, FICC proposes to 
amend Section 5 to add references to 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer,’’ ‘‘Cross- 
Margining Customer Account,’’ and 
‘‘Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
Requirement’’ after each reference to 
‘‘Segregated Indirect Participant,’’ 
‘‘Segregated Indirect Participants 
Account,’’ and ‘‘Segregated Customer 
Margin Requirement,’’ respectively. 
Description of the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement. FICC proposes 
to amend Rule 43 to explicitly describe 
the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement as follows: 
FICC proposes to add a new Section 
2(c) of Rule 43 to provide that (i) a 
Netting Member that is an Eligible BD– 
FCM may become a Cross-Margining 
Participant in connection with the 
Customer Cross-Margining Arrangement 
with the consent of FICC and CME, and 
(ii) an Eligible BD–FCM that would 
become such a Cross-Margining 
Participant shall be permitted to 
establish a Cross-Margining Customer 
Account upon acceptance by FICC and 
CME of an executed Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing Member Agreement. 
FICC proposes to amend Section 3 of 
Rule 43 to provide that, if FICC becomes 
obligated to make a payment to CME 
pursuant to the cross-guaranty under the 
Third A&R Agreement in relation to the 
obligations of a Cross-Margining 
Participant, its Cross-Margining 
Affiliate, or its Cross-Margining 
Customer, the Cross-Margining 
Participant (and, if FICC becomes 
obligated to make such a payment in 
respect of the obligations of a Cross- 
Margining Customer, the Cross- 
Margining Customer) shall thereupon 
immediately be obligated, whether or 
not FICC has then made payment to 
CME, to pay to FICC the amount of the 
reimbursement obligation that is owed 
to FICC as a result. 
FICC proposes to add a new sentence 
at the end of Section 5 of Rule 43 to 
provide that, if FICC receives a payment 
from CME pursuant to the Third A&R 
Agreement in connection with the 
Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, FICC would not be 
permitted to apply such payment to any 
obligation other than the obligations of 
Cross-Margining Customers (whether or 
not arising in connection with any 
Eligible Positions). 
Conforming and Clarifying Changes. 
FICC proposes to make the following 
conforming or clarifying changes: 
FICC proposes to amend Section 
4(b)(i) of Rule 2A to make clear that an 
applicant to become a Netting Member 
must have sufficient financial ability to 
make anticipated required deposits to 
not only Clearing Fund and Segregated 
Customer Margin, but also any Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin. 
FICC proposes to remove Section 
10(e) of Rule 3A to remove the current 
prohibition of Sponsored Members from 
participating in any Cross-Margining 
Arrangements, and accordingly 
renumber current Section 10(f) of Rule 
3A to Section 10(e). 
FICC proposes to remove (i) the 
language in parentheticals in the first 
sentence of Section 1 of Rule 13, (ii) the 
second sentence in Section 2(b) of Rule 
22A, and (iii) the portions of Sections 
2(a) and 2(b) of Rule 43 that are crossed 
out in Exhibit 5, because those 
provisions relate to the ‘‘market 
professional’’ cross-margining program, 
which is no longer active and would not 
be used if the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement becomes available. 
(iii) Implementation of the Proposal 
The proposed Third A&R Agreement 
would not become effective and replace 
the Second A&R Agreement until the 
latest of (i) the date on which all 
necessary regulatory approvals of the 
proposed Third A&R Agreement have 
been received by FICC and CME and (ii) 
a date agreed by FICC and CME.
65
Not 
later than two (2) business days 
following the date of the Commission’s 
approval of the proposed rule changes, 
FICC would add a legend to the 
proposed Third A&R Agreement to state 
that the specified changes are approved 
but not yet operative. The legend would 
also include the file number of the 
approved proposed rule change, and 
would state that once operative, the 
legend would automatically be removed 
from the proposed Third A&R 
Agreement. FICC would issue a notice 
to members providing notice of the 
specific operative date at least two 
weeks prior to such date. 
2. Statutory Basis 
FICC believes that the proposed rule 
change is consistent with Section 17A of 
the Exchange Act
66
and the rules 
thereunder applicable to FICC. 
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Exchange 
Act, requires, in part, that the rules of 
a clearing agency be designed to assure 
the safeguarding of securities and funds 
which are in the custody or control of 
the clearing agency or for which it is 
responsible.
67
FICC believes that the 
proposed rule change would assure the 
safeguarding of securities and funds 
which are in its custody or control for 
which it is responsible for a number of 
reasons. 
First, the proposed Third A&R 
Agreement and the proposed changes to 
the GSD Rules would provide for funds 
and securities posted by Cross- 
Margining Participants in respect of 
Customer Positions, i.e., Cross- Margining Customer Margin, to be 
credited to the Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin Custody Account and 
treated as financial assets within the 
meaning of the NYUCC. These changes 
would have the effect of making FICC 
the ‘‘securities intermediary’’ in respect 
of such Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin and the Eligible BD–FCM, on 
behalf of its Cross-Margining Customers, 
the ‘‘entitlement holder’’ under the 
NYUCC.
68
By virtue of these 
designations, the Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin held by FICC would 
be unavailable to satisfy the claims of 
FICC’s general creditors and would be 
reserved for the Eligible BD–FCM (on 
behalf of its Cross-Margining 
Customers), including in an FICC 
insolvency.
69
Furthermore, the 
proposed changes would prohibit FICC 
from using Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin, except to satisfy the obligations 
arising from Customer Positions of the 
Cross-Margining Participant that posted 
such margin. Accordingly, it would 
reduce the possibility of such margin 
being exposed to loss on account of not 
only FICC’s insolvency, but also the 
default of the Cross-Margining 
Participant or another Netting Member. 
The proposed changes would thus 
assure the safeguarding of the Cross- 
Margining Customer Margin.

Second, the proposed changes 
adopting and implementing the 
Customer Cross-Margining Arrangement 
would reduce the likelihood of FICC, 
each Netting Member, and indirect 
participants incurring a loss on account 
of a default by aligning each Cross- 
Margining Customer’s margin 
requirements with the risk of such 
Cross-Margining Customer’s Eligible 
Positions. Such alignment would serve 
to incentivize a Cross-Margining 
Customer to maintain portfolios that 
present lower because such lower risk 
would generally lead to lower margin 
requirements. Lower risk portfolios, in 
turn, would serve to reduce the risk of 
such Cross-Margining Customer’s 
default and the Cross-Margining 
Participant’s and FICC’s exposure 
thereto. Accordingly, by allowing a 
Cross-Margining Customer to engage in 
cross-margining activity, the proposed 
changes would serve to promote the 
risk-reducing effects of cross-margining 
that are currently only available to 
Cross-Margining Participants and their 
Eligible Affiliates. They would thus 
serve to enhance FICC’s ability to 
safeguard the securities and funds in its 
control or for which it is responsible. 
The lower margin requirements which 
would result from these changes would 
also incentivize Cross-Margining 
Customers to post initial margin in 
respect of their Eligible Positions, rather 
than rely on their Eligible BD–FCM to 
do so. Currently, FICC understands that 
it is common practice for Sponsoring 
Members and Agent Clearing Members 
to use their own assets to satisfy the 
FICC initial margin requirements 
associated with FICC-cleared positions 
that Eligible BD–FCMs carry for their 
customers.
70
This increases the costs to 
Sponsoring Members and Agent 
Clearing Members of offering customer 
clearing services and limits their 
capacity to do so. As a result of the 
proposed changes adopting and 
implementing the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement, a Cross- 
Margining Customer’s Eligible Positions 
at FICC would be eligible for a margin 
reduction if the Cross-Margining 
Customer posts the initial margin 
instead of requiring its Eligible BD–FCM 
to do so. It would thus incentivize 
Cross-Margining Customers to post such 
margin, which would likely result in an 
associated cost reduction from their 
Eligible BD–FCMs. Such posting would, 
in turn, serve to reduce Eligible BD– 
FCMs’ risk to their Cross-Margining 
Customers and thereby promote the 
safeguarding of securities and funds in 
FICC’s control or for which it is 
responsible. 
The proposed changes adopting and 
implementing the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement would also 
promote the safeguarding of funds and 
securities for which FICC is responsible 
by ensuring that Customer Positions and 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
benefit from the customer protection 
regime applicable to futures contracts 
and associated margin. They would do 
this by requiring that Customer 
Positions and Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin be carried by the 
Cross-Margining Participant in a futures 
account and by satisfying the conditions 
necessary under the Proposed Orders to 
allow the Cross-Margining Participant to 
do that. Because the Customer Positions 
and Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
would be carried in a futures account, 
an Eligible BD–FCM would generally be 
required to safeguard Customer 
Positions and Cross-Margining 
Customer Positions to a substantially 
similar extent as is required for futures 
and associated margin. Furthermore, by 
requiring that Customer Positions and 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin be 
carried in a futures account and 
satisfying the other conditions of the 
Proposed Orders, the proposed changes 
would help to ensure that Customer 
Positions and Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin constitute ‘‘customer 
property’’ for purposes of Part 190 and 
that Cross-Margining Customer claims 
therefor constitute the claims of 
‘‘customers’’ on account of their ‘‘net 
equity’’ within the meaning of Part 
190.
71
Part 190 provides that, in the 
insolvency of an FCM, ‘‘customer 
property’’ shall be distributed to 
‘‘customers’’ ratably on the basis of their 
‘‘net equity’’ claims, in priority to all 
other claims (except administrative 
claims related to the administration of 
customer property).
72
Accordingly, by 
ensuring that Customer Positions and 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin 
constitute ‘‘customer property’’ and that 
Cross-Margining Customer claims 
therefore constitute ‘‘customer’’ ‘‘net 
equity’’ claims, the proposed changes 
would aim to provide Cross-Margining 
Customers with the same priority right 
to receive distributions on their allowed 
claims with respect to the Customer 
Positions and Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin as other public 
customers of the insolvent Eligible BD– 
FCM have in respect of their futures 
positions and associated margin. 
Accordingly, it would promote the 
safeguarding of Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin and the cash and 
securities distributed in respect of 
Customer Positions from the insolvency 
of the Cross-Margining Participant. 
In addition, the proposed changes 
would promote the safeguarding of 
funds and securities for which FICC is 
responsible by ensuring that customers 
of an Eligible BD–FCM that do not 
participate in cross-margining under the 
Customer Cross-Margining Arrangement 
(as well as Cross-Margining Customers 
in relation to positions and margin not 
subject to the arrangement) remain 
entitled to the full suite of protections 
under Section 15(c)(3) of the Exchange 
Act, Rule 15c3–3 under the Exchange 
Act, and SIPA. The proposed changes 
are designed to ensure this protection by 
requiring that Cross-Margining 
Customers enter into a Customer 
Agreement that includes the terms of 
the Subordination Agreement. Pursuant 
to such terms, each Cross-Margining 
Customer would agree that its claims to 
‘‘customer property’’ as defined in SIPA 
or 11 U.S.C. 741 against the Cross- 
Margining Participant with respect to its 
Customer Positions at FICC and 
associated Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin will be subordinated to the 
claims of all other customers.
73
Such 
subordination is designed to ensure that 
the claims of Cross-Margining 
Customers in relation to Customer 
Positions or Cross-Margining Customer 
Margin do not dilute the claims of non- 
participating customers of Eligible BD– 
FCMs in relation to Segregated 
Customer Margin (as well as any claims 
Cross-Margining Customers in relation 
to Segregated Customer Margin) in a 
SIPA proceeding. Accordingly, the 
Cross-Margining Arrangement would 
help to ensure that such Segregated 
Customer Margin remains safeguarded 
to the same extent as would be the case 
in the absence of the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement. 
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Exchange 
Act requires, among other things, that 
the rules of a clearing agency be 
designed to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a national 
system for the prompt and accurate 
clearance and settlement of securities 
transactions.
74
For the reasons set out 
below, FICC believes that the proposed 
rule change would remove impediments 
to and perfect the mechanism of a 
national system for the prompt and

accurate clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions. 
The proposed changes would extend 
the existing cross-margining 
arrangement to Customer Positions, 
which is currently only available for 
clearing members (and certain Eligible 
Affiliates) at FICC and CME with respect 
to proprietary positions. By doing so, 
the proposed changes would serve to 
eliminate impediments to Cross- 
Margining Customers submitting 
transactions for central clearing. 
Specifically, the proposed rule change 
would serve to align the margin 
requirements for Customer Positions 
with the risk the positions present. As 
a result, they would eliminate 
impediments to clearing that can arise 
from unduly high margin requirements. 
Furthermore, by aligning margin 
requirements with risk, the proposed 
changes would incentivize market 
participants to submit more Treasury 
securities transactions eligible to be 
cross-margined to be cleared at FICC. 
The maintenance of such incentives to 
submit transactions for clearance and 
settlement at FICC would promote the 
diversity and scope of market 
participants able to utilize FICC’s 
multilateral netting, trade guaranty and 
centralized default management 
services. Therefore, the proposed rule 
change would also serve to promote 
prompt and accurate clearance and 
settlement of securities transactions.
75
 
Accordingly, FICC believes that the 
proposed rule change is designed to 
remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a national system for the 
prompt and accurate clearance and 
settlement of securities transactions.
76
 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(6)(i) under the 
Exchange Act requires that a covered 
clearing agency establish a risk-based 
margin system that, at a minimum, 
considers, and produces margin levels 
commensurate with, the risks and 
particular attributes of each relevant 
product, portfolio, and market and, if 
the covered clearing agency provides 
central counterparty services for U.S. 
Treasury securities, calculates, collects, 
and holds margin amounts from a direct 
participant for its proprietary positions 
in Treasury securities separately and 
independently from margin calculated 
and collected from that direct 
participant in connection with U.S. 
Treasury securities transactions by an 
indirect participant that relies on the 
services provided by the direct 
participant to access the covered 
clearing agency’s payment, clearing, or 
settlement facilities.
77
FICC believes 
that the proposed changes would ensure 
the satisfaction of these requirements. 
First, the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement would produce margin 
levels commensurate with the risks and 
particular attributes of the Eligible 
Positions. This is because FICC would 
calculate initial margin requirements for 
Customer Positions using the same 
methodology as under the Proprietary 
Cross-Margining Arrangement, with 
each Cross-Margining Customer treated 
effectively as an independent Netting 
Member. The Commission recently 
approved this methodology, finding in 
particular that it satisfied the 
requirements of Rule 17ad–22(e)(6).
78
 
Second, the proposed changes would 
provide that FICC-cleared Customer 
Positions of a Cross-Margining Customer 
would be recorded in a Cross-Margining 
Customer Account, which account 
would be a separate Type of Account for 
purposes of the GSD Rules.
79
By virtue 
of these changes, the margin applicable 
to Customer Positions would be 
calculated separately and independently 
of the margin for any positions recorded 
in a different Type of Account, 
including any Proprietary Account of 
the Cross-Margining Participant. In 
addition, the proposed rule changes 
would provide for Customer Cross- 
Margining Margin to be collected and 
held in substantially a similar manner to 
Segregated Customer Margin. The 
Commission recently approved FICC’s 
arrangements for Segregated Customer 
Margin, finding in particular that they 
‘‘should ensure that a Netting Member’s 
proprietary transactions are not netted 
with indirect participant transactions 
for margin calculations and that margin 
for indirect participant transactions is 
collected and held separately and 
independently from margin for a Netting 
Member’s proprietary transactions.’’ 
Accordingly, the proposed rule change 
would ensure compliance with Rule 
17ad–22(e)(6)(i). 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(4)(i) under the 
Exchange Act requires that a covered 
clearing agency establish, implement, 
maintain, and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to 
effectively identify, measure, monitor, 
and manage its credit exposures to 
participants and those arising from its 
payment, clearing, and settlement 
processes by maintaining sufficient 
financial resources to cover its credit 
exposure to each participant fully with 
a high degree of confidence.
80
FICC 
believes that the proposed changes 
would ensure that FICC continues to 
effectively measure and manage its 
credit exposure to participants by 
maintaining sufficient financial 
resources to cover its exposure thereto 
with a high degree of confidence. This 
is because, under the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement, FICC would 
calculate the margin requirement 
applicable to Customer Positions on a 
gross (i.e., Cross-Margining Customer- by-Cross-Margining Customer) basis, 
with margin reductions for offsetting 
positions calculated using a 
methodology that the Commission 
recently approved.
81
Examining the 
similar customer-by-customer gross 
margining arrangements adopted by 
FICC for Segregated Indirect 
Participants, the Commission found that 
they would ‘‘better isolate the risk 
profiles of individual indirect 
participants from Netting Members, 
which should help FICC better 
understand and monitor each individual 
participant’s risk exposures.’’
82
In 
addition, the proposed rule change 
would require each Eligible BD–FCM for 
whom FICC maintains one or more 
Cross-Margining Customer Account(s) to 
deposit to FICC cash or eligible 
securities to meet the Cross-Margining 
Customer Margin Requirement that is 
calibrated to the risks of each Cross- 
Margining Customer’s portfolio. Such 
Eligible BD–FCM would also be 
required to enter into a Customer Cross- 
Margining Clearing Member Agreement 
with FICC and CME, pursuant to which 
the Eligible BD–FCM would pledge to 
FICC, on behalf of itself and each Cross- 
Margining Customer, the positions and 
margin subject to the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement at both FICC 
and CME. This pledge, coupled with the 
cross-guarantee set forth in the Third 
A&R Agreement, would ensure that 
FICC and CME are able to look to the 
full portfolio of Customer Positions and 
associated margin at FICC and CME in 
order to satisfy any obligations arising

under Customer Positions. Accordingly, 
the proposed changes would ensure that 
FICC will have sufficient resources to 
rely on to cover cross-margining 
exposures under the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement. 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(18)(iv)(C) under the 
Exchange Act requires, among other 
things, that a covered clearing agency 
that provides central counterparty 
services for transactions in U.S. 
Treasury securities ensure that it has 
appropriate means to facilitate access to 
clearance and settlement services of all 
eligible secondary market transactions 
in U.S. Treasury securities, including 
those of indirect participants. As 
described above, the proposed changes 
would expand the Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, which currently is only 
available for proprietary positions of 
Cross-Margining Participants and those 
of their Eligible Affiliates, to Customer 
Positions. This expansion would serve 
to facilitate access for indirect 
participants to FICC’s clearance and 
settlement services for Treasury 
transactions by aligning the margin 
requirements applicable to such 
participants’ positions with the risk 
those positions present. Such alignment 
would serve to eliminate impediments 
to access that can arise when there is a 
mismatch between margin and risk. 
Furthermore, by creating an incentive 
for Cross-Margining Customers to cover 
the margin requirements for their own 
positions, the proposed rule change 
would serve to reduce the need for 
Netting Members to use their own 
resources to cover such margin 
obligations. As a result, it would reduce 
the costs and increase the capacity of 
Netting Members to provide clearing 
services, which would in turn allow 
Netting Members to increase the volume 
of transactions they clear and reduce the 
prices at which they provide such 
clearing services. Moreover, by creating 
significant cost savings and efficiencies 
for Cross-Margining Customers that 
consolidate offsetting positions into a 
single clearing member regardless of 
execution counterparty, the proposed 
changes would create a natural 
incentive for Netting Members to offer 
done-away clearing services. For such 
Netting Members, carrying Treasury 
securities positions entered into by a 
customer with other parties would 
provide a potential opportunity to 
reduce the risk of the customer’s futures 
positions and earn clearing revenue 
without the cost of funding the 
customer’s margin obligations, and such 
clearing services could create 
opportunities to increase the Netting 
Member’s scope of customers. 
Therefore, the proposed changes would 
facilitate access to clearance and 
settlement services of all eligible 
secondary market transactions in U.S. 
Treasury securities, including those of 
indirect participants.
83
 
(B) Clearing Agency’s Statement on 
Burden on Competition 
FICC believes that the proposed 
changes to the GSD Rules and the Third 
A&R Agreement would promote 
competition by enabling customers of 
Eligible BD–FCMs to benefit from cross- 
margining. 
As described above, under the 
Existing Agreement, cross-margining is 
currently only available for a Cross- 
Margining Participant’s proprietary 
positions and those of an Eligible 
Affiliate. Accordingly, customers of 
Cross-Margining Participants are not 
able to benefit from cross-margining; 
they must continue to have their 
Eligible Securities Positions margined 
without regard to potential risk offsets 
involving other Eligible Futures 
Positions. By extending availability of 
cross-margining to Customer Positions, 
the proposed rule change would serve to 
place customers of Eligible BD–FCMs on 
a more level playing field with Cross- 
Margining Participants and Eligible 
Affiliates. It would ensure that such 
customers have the ability to achieve 
similar margin efficiencies and pursue 
similar trading strategies on similar 
terms as Cross-Margining Participants 
and Eligible Affiliates. As a result, the 
proposed changes would improve 
competitive parity in the U.S. Treasury 
market between direct participants and 
indirect participants at FICC. 
The proposed rule change would also 
promote competition by allowing all 
customers of Eligible BD–FCMs, rather 
than only market professionals or a 
similar subset, to access central clearing. 
As a result, the propose rule change 
would ensure that introducing cross- 
margining maintains competitive parity 
among customers of Eligible BD–FCMs. 
FICC believes that the proposed rule 
change would introduce a burden of 
competition as between Eligible BD– 
FCMs and other Netting Members 
because the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement would only be available 
for Customer Positions carried by 
Eligible BD–FCMs. However, FICC 
believes that this burden on competition 
is necessary in order to ensure that 
Customer Positions and associated 
Cross-Margining Customer Margin are 
safeguarded pursuant to robust 
customer protections. In particular, the 
dual registration of an Eligible BD–FCM 
as a broker-dealer and FCM is necessary 
to ensure that the Customer Positions 
and associated margin can be carried in 
a futures account under the CEA and 
applicable CFTC regulations and that 
they benefit from the Part 190 
distributional rules in the event of the 
clearing member’s failure. FICC has 
concluded that it would not be feasible 
to achieve similar customer protections 
if Customer Positions were carried at a 
Netting Member not registered as a BD 
and FCM. Indeed, FICC has observed 
that other U.S. cross-margining 
arrangements involving customers 
similarly require such dual registration 
as a condition to participation in the 
arrangement.
84
 
In addition, the proposed rule change 
would promote competition by 
providing market participants with 
greater flexibility in the methods 
through which transactions in U.S. 
Treasury securities can be cleared. With 
the introduction of the Customer Cross- 
Margining Arrangement, clearing 
members will be able to offer a wider 
variety of clearing methods to their 
indirect participant customers. Such 
indirect participants will accordingly be 
able to participate in a wider variety of 
clearing methods, and will be able to 
choose whether to clear transactions 
under the Customer Cross-Margining 
Arrangement or whether to clear 
transactions at FICC without engaging in 
cross-margining. 
Accordingly, the proposed rule 
change would promote competition by 
allowing Cross-Margining Customers to 
obtain the benefits associated with 
cross-margining, ensuring that Cross- 
Margining Customers are not at an 
undue competitive disadvantage relative 
to clearing members and certain Eligible 
Affiliates who are currently able to 
access such benefits under the 
Proprietary Cross-Margining 
Arrangement, and providing market 
participants with greater flexibility in 
the access models available for the 
clearing of transactions in U.S. treasury 
securities.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; MIAX 
PEARL, LLC; Notice of Filing of a 
Proposed Rule Change To Allow Post- 
Only Orders in Sub-Dollar Securities 
December 19, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
10, 2025, MIAX PEARL, LLC (‘‘MIAX 
Pearl’’ or the ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
subparagraph (c)(2) of Exchange Rule 
2614, Orders and Order Instructions, to 
allow the Post Only order instruction to 
be applied to orders in securities priced 
below $1.00 on its equity trading 
platform (referred to herein as ‘‘MIAX 
Pearl Equities’’).
3
The Exchange also 
proposes to adopt Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2)(i)(A) to reprice non-displayed 
orders in securities priced below $1.00 
to the locking price to help reduce the 
occurrence of an internally crossed 
book. Additionally, the Exchange 
proposes to make a related change to 
subparagraph (a)(4)(iv) of Exchange Rule 
2617, Order Execution and Routing, to 
also apply to orders in securities priced 
below $1.00 with a Post Only order 
instruction to help alleviate an 
internally locked or crossed book in the 
rare event they do occur. These 
proposed changes are designed to allow 
the Exchange to better compete with 
other exchanges with like functionality 
for order flow in securities trading 
below $1.00 while also seeking to attract 
more liquidity in securities that trade 
below $1.00 onto an exchange, where 
those orders may benefit from price 
discovery and improved market 
transparency. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at

II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, 
MIAX Pearl included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the

The increase in sub-dollar trading volume has 
not been due to any new or novel exchange order 
types, but rather increased retail participation, 
especially since the Covid–19 pandemic and social 
media-fueled hype; rise of off-exchange trading, 
including dark pools; reverse stock splits; and high 
market volatility causing prices to fall and making 
them prone to trading below $1.00. See, e.g., U.S

The Exchange notes that it reviewed these two 
order instructions because they are the only 
instructions available on the Exchange that may 
cause an internally non-displayed locked or crossed 
book.

The Exchange will not file a proposed fee

structure for securities priced below $1.00 to levels 
that may cause more than a de minimis increase in 
the occurrence of an internally non-displayed 
locked or crossed market on the Exchange. 
most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
Currently, with the exception of the 
Post Only instruction (described below), 
all order types and order instructions 
are available to orders in all securities 
regardless of price. Only the Post Only 
instruction is currently limited to 
securities priced at or above $1.00. The 
Exchange proposes to remove this 
exception and amend subparagraph 
(c)(2) of Exchange Rule 2614, Orders 
and Order Instructions, to allow the Post 
Only order instruction to be applied to 
orders in securities priced below $1.00 
on MIAX Pearl Equities. As explained 
below, this portion of the proposal is 
currently available on other equities 
exchanges. This proposal is, therefore, 
designed to increase competition among 
exchanges for order flow in securities 
priced below $1.00 and to make all 
order types and order instructions 
available equally to orders in all 
securities regardless of the order’s price. 
This proposal is not intended to 
encourage an increase in the overall 
volume or order flow in sub-dollar 
securities. Trading in sub-dollar 
securities both on- and off-exchange has 
grown significantly since the Exchange 
adopted Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2) and 
launched operations in September 2020. 
For example, average daily sub-dollar 
trading volume comprised 
approximately 9% of the overall daily 
volume in September 2025. In fact, the 
Exchange found that overall volume in 
sub-dollar securities has been slowly 
decreasing since June 2025 from 
approximately 14% to 9% in September 
2025. Meanwhile, off-exchange market 
share in sub-dollar securities remained 
high averaging over 60%.
4
 
There are numerous other factors that 
contribute to sub-dollar trading 
volumes, the majority of which occurs 
off-exchange.
5
The Exchange believes 
this proposal will increase exchange 
competition by allowing the Exchange 
to provide functionality that would 
allow it to attract a greater slice of the 
current volume in sub-dollar securities 
by encouraging market participants to 
send their sub-dollar trading volume to 
an exchange-level pool of liquidity, 
rather than the opaque off-exchange 
trading venues (i.e., dark pools), which are less transparent. In addition, various 
Equity Members
6
have recently 
requested the Exchange modify its 
functionality to allow the Post Only 
instruction to be available for orders in 
securities priced below $1.00. 
The Exchange notes that differences 
exist between the market structures for 
securities priced at or above $1.00 and 
those below $1.00 that impact how the 
Post Only order instruction may 
function. This includes different fee 
levels and minimum price increments 
which allow for both an internally 
locked or crossed market to be caused 
by an order with a Post Only instruction 
priced below $1.00. Meanwhile, these 
different fee levels and minimum price 
increments allow for only an internally 
locked market to be caused by an order 
with a Post Only instruction priced at or 
above $1.00. 
The Exchange reviewed its data and 
found that internally locked and crossed 
markets are rare events and should 
continue to be rare under this proposal. 
Based on the Exchange’s data for 
securities priced at or above $1.00, an 
internally non-displayed locked or 
crossed market caused by an order that 
includes a Minimum Execution 
Quantity (‘‘MEQ’’) instruction 
(described below) or an internally non- 
displayed locked market caused by an 
order with a Post Only instruction (also 
described below) is extremely rare.
7
For 
securities priced at or above $1.00, the 
Exchange reviewed a sampling of data 
that included high volume securities 
with increased usage of the Post Only 
and MEQ instructions on active trading 
days. The selected securities also 
experienced an increased usage of the 
MEQ and/or Post Only instructions. 
Based on this sampling, the Exchange 
experienced an internally locked book 
for the selected securities priced at or 
above $1.00 in approximately 1.00% of 
all order book updates and an internally 
crossed book in approximately 0.10% of 
all order book updates. 
The Exchange conducted a similar 
review for securities priced below $1.00 
but focused on a sampling of data that 
included high volume sub-dollar 
securities on active trading days that 
experienced an increased usage of the 
MEQ instruction. Unlike the above 
review of securities priced at or above 
$1.00, the Exchange could not review 
securities priced below $1.00 with a 
Post Only instruction because the 
Exchange does not currently offer such 
functionality and proposes to do so 
herein. Based on this review, the 
Exchange found that an internally non- 
displayed locked or crossed book in 
sub-dollar securities caused by an order 
that includes an MEQ instruction did 
not occur during a sampling of active 
trading days in any of the high volume 
sub-dollar securities the Exchange 
observed.
8
Based on the Exchange’s 
expertise and experience, the differing 
uses of the Post Only instruction and 
MEQ instruction, as well as other 
external factors, the Exchange does not 
anticipate that expanding the Post Only 
instruction to sub-dollar securities 
would cause a disproportionate increase 
in the use of the Post Only instruction 
as compared to the MEQ instruction 
with orders in securities priced below 
$1.00 that could result in anything other 
than, at most, a potential de minimis 
increase of internally non-displayed 
locked or crossed markets on the 
Exchange. Based on the Exchange’s 
observations and experience, in the rare 
event they do occur, an internally non- 
displayed locked or crossed book is 
typically alleviated almost immediately 
or within an extremely short period of 
time of their initial occurrence. 
Nonetheless, the Exchange has 
mechanisms to both avoid an internally 
crossed market and to alleviate an 
internally locked or crossed market, in 
the rare event they occur. First, the 
Exchange proposes to adopt Exchange 
Rule 2614(c)(2)(i)(A) to reprice non- 
displayed orders in securities priced 
below $1.00 to the locking price of the 
displayed order resting on the MIAX 
Pearl Equities Book to help reduce the 
occurrence of an internally crossed

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60809 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices 9
The Exchange notes that this functionality 
would also apply to orders in securities priced at 
or above $1.00 in the unlikely event that an 
incoming order in a security priced at or above 
$1.00 with a Post Only instruction would post to 
the MIAX Pearl Equities Book and result in an 
internally non-displayed crossed market. 
10
The term ‘‘Aggressing Order’’ is an order to buy 
(sell) that is or becomes marketable against sell 
(buy) interest on the MIAX Pearl Equities Book. A 
resting order may become an Aggressing Order if its 
working price changes, if the PBBO or NBBO is 
updated, because of changes to other orders on the 
MIAX Pearl Equities Book, or when processing 
inbound messages. See Exchange Rule 1901. 11
An order to buy (sell) a stated amount of a 
security that is to be executed at the PBO (PBB) or 
better. A Market Order shall not trade through a 
Protected Quotation. See Exchange Rule 2614(a)(2). 12
An order to buy or sell a stated amount of a 
security at a specified price or better. A 
‘‘marketable’’ Limit Order to buy (sell) will trade 
with all orders to sell (buy) priced at or below 
(above) the PBO (PBB) for the security. Once no 
longer marketable, the Limit Order will be ranked 
on the MIAX Pearl Equities Book pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 2616. An incoming Limit Order may 
be designated as ISO. See Exchange Rule 2614(a)(1). 13
See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 89563 (August 14, 2020), 85 FR 51510 (August 20,

Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by Amendment 
No. 1, to Establish Rules Governing the Trading of

14
The Exchange notes that an order in a security 
priced below $1.00 that includes the Post Only 
instruction will not remove liquidity when there is 
no marketable contra-side liquidity resting on the 
MIAX Pearl Equities Book, either due to the limit 
price of the resting and incoming orders or there 
being no contra-side liquidity available. 
15
To determine at the time of a potential 
execution whether the value of such execution 
when removing liquidity equals or exceeds the 
value of such execution if the order instead posted 
to the MIAX Pearl Equities Book and subsequently 
provided liquidity, the Exchange will use the 
highest possible rebate paid and highest possible 
fee charged for such executions on the Exchange. 
The Exchange provides for a maker/taker fee 
structure. For displayed orders in securities priced 
at or above $1.00, the highest possible fee is 
currently $0.00300 for removing liquidity and the 
highest possible rebate is currently ($0.0037) for 
providing liquidity, requiring at least $0.0067 of 
price improvement. See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Section 1)a). For non-displayed orders in 
securities priced at or above $1.00, the highest 
possible fee is currently $0.00300 for removing 
liquidity and the highest possible rebate is currently 
($0.00200) for providing liquidity, requiring at least 
$0.005 of price improvement. Id. 
16
The term ‘‘User’’ shall mean any Member or 
Sponsored Participant who is authorized to obtain 
access to the System pursuant to Exchange Rule 
2602. See Exchange Rule 1901. 17
See Exchange Rule 2614(a)(1)(iv). 18
See Exchange Rule 2614(a)(3)(v). 19
See supra note 15. The Exchange provides for 
a maker/taker fee structure. For both displayed and 
non-displayed orders in securities priced below 
$1.00, the highest possible fee is currently 0.20% 
of the trade’s dollar value for removing liquidity 
and the highest possible rebate is currently (0.15%) 
of the trade’s dollar value for providing liquidity, 
requiring at least 0.35% of the trade’s value as price 
improvement. See MIAX Pearl Equities Fee Schedule, Section 1)a). 
book.

Proposed Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2)(i)(A) is based on Exchange 
Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv), which describes 
similar re-pricing of orders with an 
MEQ instruction that cross a contra-side 
displayed order. 
In addition, should an internally 
locked or crossed market occur, the 
Exchange has a current mechanism 
under Exchange Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv) to 
alleviate those occurrences while 
honoring intra-market price priority. 
Specifically, Exchange Rule 
2617(a)(4)(iv) provides that, for 
securities priced equal to or greater than 
$1.00, in the case where a non- 
displayed order to sell (buy) is posted 
on the MIAX Pearl Equities Book at a 
price that locks or crosses a displayed 
order to buy (sell), an Aggressing 
Order
10
or an incoming order to buy 
(sell) that is a Market Order
11
or a Limit 
Order
12
priced more aggressively than 
the order to buy (sell) displayed on the 
MIAX Pearl Equities Book will execute 
against the non-displayed order to sell 
(buy) resting on the MIAX Pearl Equities 
Book at one-half minimum price 
variation greater (less) than the price of 
the resting displayed order to buy (sell). 
The Exchange proposes to expand this 
mechanism under Exchange Rule 
2617(a)(4)(iv) to securities priced below 
$1.00, which would allow for consistent 
treatment of all securities during an 
internally locked or crossed market, 
regardless of price. Expanding the re- 
pricing mechanism described in 
Exchange Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv) would 
allow the Exchange to treat orders in 
securities priced below $1.00 in the 
same manner as orders in securities 
priced at or above $1.00. This change 
would also ensure that intra-market 
price priority continues to be honored 
by treating all orders with a Post Only 
instruction in a similar manner 
regardless of price. Therefore, this 
portion of the proposal would facilitate 
transactions in securities as well as 
remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system in 
accordance with the Act. This 
functionality has also been considered 
by the Commission numerous times and 
does not raise any new or novel 
issues.
13
 
Each of these changes proposed 
herein are described in more detail 
below. 
Expanding Post Only Instruction to Sub- 
Dollar Securities 
Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2) describes 
the Post Only order instruction and 
provides that an order designated as 
Post Only is a non-routable order that is 
ranked and executed on the MIAX Pearl 
Equities Book pursuant to Exchange 
Rule 2616 and Exchange Rule 
2617(a)(4). Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2) 
further provides that an order 
designated as Post Only will only 
remove liquidity from the MIAX Pearl 
Equities Book when: (A) the order is for 
a security priced below $1.00;
14
or (B) 
the value of such execution when 
removing liquidity equals or exceeds the 
value of such execution if the order 
instead posted to the MIAX Pearl 
Equities Book and subsequently 
provided liquidity including the 
applicable fees charged or rebates 
paid.
15
An order designated as Post 
Only is subject to the price sliding 
processes set forth in Exchange Rule 
2614(g), unless otherwise instructed by 
the User
16
(i.e., the User elects that the order be cancelled rather than subject to 
a price sliding process). The Post Only 
instruction is available for Limit 
Orders
17
and Pegged Orders only.
18
 
The Exchange now proposes to 
provide the Post Only instruction to 
orders in securities priced below $1.00. 
To effectuate this change, the Exchange 
proposes to delete subparagraph 
(2)(i)(A) of Exchange Rule 2614(c) that 
limits the availability of the Post Only 
instruction to securities priced at or 
above $1.00. As a result, Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2) would provide that an order 
designated as Post Only will only 
remove liquidity from the MIAX Pearl 
Equities Book when the value of such 
execution when removing liquidity 
equals or exceeds the value of such 
execution if the order instead posted to 
the MIAX Pearl Equities Book and 
subsequently provided liquidity 
including the applicable fees charged or 
rebates paid.
19
The Exchange believes 
this proposal is reasonable because it is 
competitive in nature, designed to 
attract additional liquidity and quoting 
on the Exchange, and provides Equity 
Members with consistent order handling 
of all their orders, regardless of price. 
In sum, the Post Only instruction 
provides Equity Members with the 
ability to increase the likelihood that 
their order will add liquidity to the 
order book and will not remove 
liquidity unless certain price 
improvement requirements are satisfied. 
This effectively guarantees that the 
order will only trade at a price better 
than its limit price when removing 
liquidity, while potentially receiving 
rebates for adding liquidity to the

Nasdaq provides for Minimum Quantity 
Orders, which, like a Post Only instruction, may 
result in an internally non-displayed locked or 
crossed market, as discussed herein. See Nasdaq Equity 4, Rule 4703(e) (‘‘Minimum Quantity

25
The Exchange notes that this functionality 
would also apply to orders in securities priced at 
or above $1.00 in the unlikely event that an 
incoming order in a security priced at or above 
$1.00 with a Post Only instruction would post to 
the MIAX Pearl Equities Book and result in an 
internally non-displayed crossed market. 
market. This is designed to incentivize 
market participants to post aggressively 
priced liquidity and improve price 
discovery. By adding orders to the order 
book, orders with a Post Only 
instruction contribute to improved 
liquidity, market depth and, if 
displayed, price transparency. 
The Exchange believes this proposed 
rule change to expand Post Only 
functionality to orders in sub-dollar 
securities would provide an additional 
exchange-level pool of liquidity for 
market participants that utilize Post 
Only functionality for sub-dollar 
securities. As such, the proposed rule 
change may encourage market 
participants to send additional sub- 
dollar trading volume to an exchange, 
rather than off-exchange marketplaces 
(i.e., dark pools), which provide less transparent pricing. In general, the Post 
Only instruction allows for an order to 
be posted to the MIAX Pearl Equities 
Book at its limit price and, therefore, 
serves to improve on-exchange 
liquidity, which benefits all market 
participants by providing more trading 
opportunities. Orders with a Post Only 
instruction entered onto an exchange 
may also serve to improve price 
transparency if the entering firm elected 
such order to be displayed and made 
available via an exchange’s data feeds 
and disseminated by the applicable 
Securities Information Processor 
(‘‘SIP’’). This proposal serves to benefit 
market participants by expanding 
existing functionality available to orders 
in securities priced at or above $1.00 to 
orders in securities priced below $1.00, 
with no functional difference. 
The Exchange initially adopted its 
Post Only order instruction behavior as 
part of its broader proposal to adopt 
rules governing trading of equity 
securities, in which it sought to operate 
its equity market in a manner similar to 
that of other equity exchanges that it 
based its rules and functionality upon 
several years ago. This included 
adopting functionality that limited the 
functionality of the Post Only 
instruction to orders in securities priced 
at or above $1.00. The Exchange did not 
adopt this limitation due to fear of some 
potential nefarious activity in sub-dollar 
securities trading, but rather due to lack 
of interest by market participants in 
such functionality at the time MIAX 
Pearl Equities was being developed and 
had filed its initial rule set with the 
Commission for approval. 
Applying Post Only treatment to sub- 
dollar securities is also not unique. 
Today, a number of other equities 
exchanges allow securities priced below 
$1.00 to be treated as ‘‘post only.’’ For 
example, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 
(‘‘Nasdaq’’) provides a Post Only Order, 
which offers market participants the 
ability to submit an order that is not 
eligible for routing to away markets and 
posts to the Nasdaq book at prices below 
$1.00.

Specifically, Nasdaq’s Post 
Only Order acts like the Exchange’s Post 
Only order instruction in securities 
priced at or above $1.00 and provides, 
in sum, that a ‘‘Post-Only Order will be 
posted, ranked, and displayed at its 
limit price; provided, however, the Post- 
Only Order will execute if it is priced 
at $1.00 or more and the value of price 
improvement associated with executing 
against an Order on the Nasdaq Book 
equals or exceeds $0.01 per share.’’
21
 
Nasdaq applies the same behavior to 
Post-Only Orders in securities priced 
below $1.00 and provides that the Post- 
Only Order would execute if ‘‘the value 
of price improvement associated with 
executing against an Order on the 
Nasdaq Book (as measured against the 
original limit price of the Order) equals 
or exceeds the sum of fees charged for 
such execution and the value of any 
rebate that would be provided if the 
Order posted to the Nasdaq Book and 
subsequently provided liquidity’’.
22
 
This is identical to the functionality that 
the Exchange proposes herein and is 
also available on Nasdaq’s affiliate 
exchanges that trade equity securities.
23
 
The New York Stock Exchange LLC 
(‘‘NYSE’’) and its affiliate exchanges 
also provide similar ‘‘post only’’ 
functionality in the form of Add 
Liquidity Only (‘‘ALO’’) orders, which 
is also available to securities priced 
below $1.00.
24
This proposal would 
expand the population of exchanges that 
offer ‘‘post only’’ treatment for securities 
priced below $1.00 and would not only 
allow the Exchange to compete with 
exchanges that currently offer such 
functionality to sub-dollar securities, 
but also enable the Exchange to provide 
an additional exchange-level pool of 
liquidity where market participants may 
send such orders. 
Expanding Existing Functionality To 
Avoid or Alleviate Internally Locked or 
Crossed Markets to Securities Priced 
Below $1.00 With a Post Only 
Instruction 
As mentioned above, differences exist 
between the market structures for 
securities priced at or above $1.00 and 
those below $1.00, such as differing fee 
levels and minimum price increments. 
Due to these differences, orders in 
securities priced at or above $1.00 that 
contain a Post Only instruction do not 
result in an internally crossed market 
because the minimum tick increments 
allows the order to receive the required 
amount of price improvement to execute 
against a contra-side order. On the 
contrary, the minimum price increments 
and different fee levels for securities 
priced below $1.00 would not always 
ensure that an order with a Post Only 
instruction would receive the necessary 
price improvement to execute. As a 
result, unlike an order in a security 
priced at or above $1.00, an order in a 
security priced below $1.00 with a Post 
Only instruction may post at a price that 
results in an internally crossed market. 
According to the data discussed above, 
the Exchange does not expect a material 
increase in internally locked and 
crossed markets due to this proposal. 
However, should they occur, the 
Exchange has mechanisms in place 
today to avoid or alleviate an internally 
locked and crossed market that it 
proposes to expand to locked or crossed 
markets that may result from an order 
priced below $1.00 with a Post Only 
instruction. 
First, the Exchange proposes to adopt 
Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2)(i)(A) to 
reprice non-displayed orders in 
securities priced below $1.00 to the 
locking price of the displayed order to 
help reduce the occurrence of an 
internally crossed book.
25
As mentioned 
above, proposed Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2)(i)(A) is based on Exchange 
Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv), which describes 
similar re-pricing of orders with an 
MEQ instruction that cross a contra-side 
displayed order. 
Second, the Exchange proposes to 
make a related change to Exchange Rule 
2617(a)(4)(iv) to treat securities priced 
below $1.00 in the same manner as it 
currently treats securities priced at or 
above $1.00 during an internally locked 
or crossed market. Expanding Exchange 
Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv) as proposed herein

One byproduct of the Post Only order 
instruction is that it may result in the order for a 
security priced at or above $1.00 posting to the 
MIAX Pearl Equities Book at a price that results in 
an internally locked market on the Exchange. The 
Exchange notes that due to its fee structure, an 
incoming order in a security priced at or above 
$1.00 designated as Post Only that crosses a contra- 
side order resting on the MIAX Pearl Equities Book 
will execute upon entry because it would receive 
the necessary amount of price improvement in 
accordance with Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2). 
Therefore, such orders will not post to the MIAX 
Pearl Equities Book and cause an internally crossed 
market in securities priced at or above $1.00. 
27
The Exchange notes that this functionality 
would also apply to orders in securities priced at 
or above $1.00 in the unlikely event that an 
incoming order in a security priced at or above 
$1.00 with a Post Only instruction would post to 
the MIAX Pearl Equities Book and result in an 
internally non-displayed crossed market. 
28
See Exchange Rule 2614(g)(2). 29
See Nasdaq Rule 4703(e). For example, Nasdaq Rule 4703(e) provides that if there was an order to 
buy at $11 with a minimum quantity condition of 
500 shares, and there were resting orders on the 
Nasdaq Book to sell 200 shares at $10.99 and 300 
shares at $11, the order would be repriced to $10.98 
and ranked at that price. 
30
See IEX Rule 11.190(h)(2). would allow the Exchange to treat 
orders in securities priced below $1.00 
with a Post Only order instruction the 
same as orders in securities priced at or 
above $1.00 by allowing an execution at 
one-half minimum price variation 
greater (less) than the price of the 
resting displayed order to buy (sell) as 
set forth in the Rule. 
Both of these proposals are an 
expansion of existing functionality and 
Exchange Rules, and, therefore, do not 
raise any new or novel issues. Each of 
these changes are described separately 
below. 
Re-Pricing Non-Displayed Orders to the 
Locking Price To Decrease the 
Occurrence of an Internally Crossed 
Market 
As discussed above, if this proposal is 
approved, an order designated as Post 
Only in a security priced below $1.00 
may post to the MIAX Pearl Equities 
Book at a price that results in an 
internally crossed market.
26
However, 
the Exchange will never post a 
displayed or non-displayed order to the 
MIAX Pearl Equities Book at a price that 
would cross a contra-side displayed 
order. 
In keeping with this principle, the 
Exchange proposes to reprice non- 
displayed orders in securities priced 
below $1.00 in a similar scenario to help 
reduce the occurrence of an internally 
crossed book.
27
As proposed, Exchange 
Rule 2614(c)(2)(i)(A) would describe 
how a resting displayed order and an 
incoming non-displayed order 
designated as Post Only would be re- 
priced. Specifically, Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2)(i)(A) would provide that a 
non-displayed order designated as Post 
Only to buy (sell) that does not remove 
liquidity pursuant to Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2)(i), and that incoming non- 
displayed order, if posted at its limit 
price, would cross a displayed order to 
sell (buy) resting on the MIAX Pearl 
Equities Book, the non-displayed order 
will have a working price equal to the 
price of the displayed order to sell 
(buy). Proposed Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2)(i)(A) would also describe 
how a resting non-displayed order that 
would be crossed by an incoming 
displayed order with a Post Only 
instruction would be re-priced to have 
a working price equal to the locking 
price of the incoming displayed order. 
Specifically, proposed Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2)(i)(A) would provide that 
where a displayed order designated as 
Post Only to buy (sell) does not remove 
liquidity pursuant to Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2)(i), and that displayed order, if 
posted at its limit price, would cross a 
non-displayed order to sell (buy) resting 
on the MIAX Pearl Equities Book, the 
non-displayed order will have a 
working price equal to the price of the 
displayed order to sell (buy). 
The Exchange notes that this portion 
of the proposal is consistent with how 
it currently re-prices orders with an 
MEQ instruction in the same 
circumstances. Specifically, for orders 
with an MEQ instruction, Exchange 
Rule 2614(c)(7)(B)(ii) provides that 
where there is insufficient size to satisfy 
the minimum quantity condition of an 
incoming order to buy (sell) and that 
incoming order, if posted at its limit 
price, would cross a displayed order to 
sell (buy) resting on the MIAX Pearl 
Equities Book, the order to buy (sell) 
with the MEQ instruction will have a 
working price equal to the price of the 
displayed order to sell (buy). The 
Exchange proposes to apply the same 
behavior to other non-displayed orders 
as described herein. 
Not only is proposed Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2)(i)(A) similar to how the 
Exchange re-prices orders with an MEQ 
instruction under Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(7)(B)(ii), it is also similar to how 
the Exchange currently reprices non- 
displayed orders that cross the Protected 
Quotation of an external market.
28
Both 
IEX and Nasdaq re-price non-displayed 
orders to avoid an internally crossed 
market. In certain circumstances, 
Nasdaq re-prices non-displayed orders 
to buy (sell) to one minimum price 
increment below (above) the lowest 
(highest) price of resting orders to avoid 
an internally crossed market.
29
 
Likewise, IEX re-prices non-displayed 
orders that include a limit price more 
aggressive than the midpoint of the 
NBBO to the midpoint of the NBBO to 
prevent such orders from being posted 
at a price that crossed their midpoint of 
the NBBO.
30
 
The Exchange believes that this 
portion of the proposal is consistent 
with the Act because it enables the 
Exchange to avoid an internally crossed 
book. Proposed Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2)(i)(A) is also not new or novel 
as it is based on existing functionality 
in place on the Exchange and other 
equity exchanges to avoid internally 
crossed markets. The Exchange also 
believes re-pricing a non-displayed 
order as proposed herein is not unfairly 
discriminatory because it seeks to avoid 
an abnormal market condition, i.e., an internally crossed book, in favor of an 
order with Post Only instruction that 
could represent more aggressively 
priced liquidity and price improvement 
opportunities for other contra-side 
orders. Like the Exchange provides 
today for orders with an MEQ 
instruction, Equity Members would be 
immediately notified if their order is re- 
priced as proposed herein and may re- 
enter such order with a new price if 
they choose to do so. 
The following examples illustrate this 
proposed functionality. 
Example No. 1 
A non-displayed order with a Post 
Only instruction to buy at $0.8009 
(‘‘Order 1’’) is entered and there is a 
displayed order resting on the MIAX 
Pearl Equities Book to sell at $0.8008 
(‘‘Order 2’’). Order 1 does not remove 
liquidity upon entry pursuant to the 
Exchange’s economic best interest 
functionality under Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2) because it would not receive 
the requisite price improvement. The 
price of Order 1, if posted to the MIAX 
Pearl Equities Book, would cross the 
price of Order 2. In such case, to avoid 
an internally crossed book, the System 
will re-price Order 1 to $0.8008, the 
locking price of the displayed order 
resting on the MIAX Pearl Equities 
Book. 
Example No. 2 
A non-displayed order to buy at 
$0.8009 is resting on the MIAX Pearl 
Equities Book (‘‘Order 1’’). A displayed 
order with a Post Only instruction to 
sell at $0.8008 is entered (‘‘Order 2’’). 
Order 2 does not remove liquidity upon 
entry pursuant to the Exchange’s 
economic best interest functionality 
under Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2) because 
it would not receive the requisite price 
improvement. The price of Order 2, if

See supra note 15. Price improvement of 
$0.0004 does not exceed the required 0.35% of the 
trade’s value for there to be an execution pursuant 
to the Exchange’s economic best interest 
functionality under Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2). 
32
Exchange Rules 2617(a)(4)(i)–(ii) are based on 
NYSE Rule 7.37(a), Cboe BZX and Cboe BYX Rules 11.13(a)(4)(A)–(B), and Cboe EDGA and Cboe EDGX Rules 11.10(a)(4)(A)–(B). 
33
The term ‘‘System’’ means the automated 
trading system used by the Exchange for the trading 
of securities. See Exchange Rule 100. 34
Exchange Rule 2617(a)(4)(iii) is based on Cboe 
BZX and Cboe BYX Rules 11.13(a)(4)(C), and Cboe EDGA and Cboe EDGX Rules 11.10(a)(4)(C). 35
The Exchange notes that its rules and the Act 
prohibit the Exchange from displaying a locked or 
crossed market and an order that would create a 
displayed locked or crossed market on the 
Exchange would be rejected, if incoming, or 
cancelled, if resting. See, e.g., Exchange Rules 
2617(a)(4) (providing that ‘‘[a]n order will be 
cancelled back to the User if, based on market 
conditions, User instructions, applicable Exchange 
Rules and/or the Act and the rules and regulations 
thereunder, such order is not executable, cannot be 
routed to another Trading Center pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this Exchange Rule 2617 below and 
cannot be posted to the MIAX Pearl Equities 
Book’’); 2617(a)(4)(iii) (stating that ‘‘that the System 
will never display a locked or crossed market’’); 
and 2624(b) (stating that ‘‘the System shall not make available for dissemination, and Users shall 
reasonably avoid displaying, and shall not engage 
in a pattern or practice of displaying, any 
quotations that lock or cross a Protected Quotation, 
and any Manual Quotations that lock or cross a 
quotation previously disseminated pursuant to an 
Effective National Market System Plan’’). See also Rules 610 and 611 of Regulation NMS. 
36
See Exchange Rule 2612, Minimum Price Variations. Exchange Rule 2612(a) provides that 
bids, offers, orders or indications of interests in 
securities traded on the Exchange shall not be made 
in an increment smaller than: (1) $0.01 if those bids, 
offers or indications of interests are priced equal to 
or greater than $1.00 per share; or (2) $0.0001 if 
those bids, offers or indications of interests are 
priced less than $1.00 per share. 
37
This functionality is well established and has 
been previously approved by the Commission. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 89563 (August 
14, 2020), 85 FR 51510 (August 20, 2020) (SR– 
PEARL–2020–03) (adopting rules for MIAX Pearl 
Equities, including Exchange Rule 2617(a)(4)). See 
posted to the MIAX Pearl Equities Book, 
would cross the price of Order 1. In 
such case, to avoid an internally crossed 
book, the System will re-price Order 1 
to $0.8008, the locking price of the 
incoming displayed order. 
Example No. 3 
The following example describes 
when an incoming non-displayed order 
with a Post Only instruction is re-priced 
to the locking price pursuant to 
proposed Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2)(i)(A). Assume the PBBO is 
$0.50 by $0.53. A non-displayed Limit 
Order to buy at $0.5003 is entered and 
placed on the MIAX Pearl Equities Book 
(‘‘Order 1’’). Then, a non-displayed 
Limit Order to sell with a Post Only 
instruction at $0.5001 (‘‘Order 2’’) is 
entered. Order 2 cannot execute against 
Order 1 and remove liquidity upon 
entry pursuant to the Exchange’s 
economic best interest functionality 
under Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2) because 
it would not receive the requisite price 
improvement.
31
Therefore, Order 2 will 
be re-priced and posted to the MIAX 
Pearl Equities Book and be non- 
displayed at $0.5003, the price of the 
displayed contra-side order, Order 1, 
pursuant to proposed Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2)(1)(A) discussed above, 
resulting in an internally non-displayed 
locked book. Then, a displayed Limit 
Order to buy at $0.5004 (‘‘Order 3’’) is 
entered and executes against Order 2 at 
$0.50035, providing one-half minimum 
price increment of price improvement 
as compared to the price the order was 
posted at of $0.5003. However, if Order 
3 was an order to sell at $0.5003, it 
would execute against Order 1 at 
$0.5003, Order 1’s displayed price. If 
Order 3 was an order to sell at $0.5004, 
it would not execute because there is no 
marketable contra-side interest, and 
would be posted to the MIAX Pearl 
Equities Book at $0.5004. 
Expanding Current Internally Locked or 
Crossed Book Order Handling To 
Alleviate an Internally Locked or 
Crossed Market to Securities Priced 
Below $1.00 
By way of background, Exchange 
Rules 2617(a)(4)(i) and (ii) describe the 
process for matching incoming and 
Aggressing Orders for execution against 
contra-side orders resting on the MIAX 
Pearl Equities Book.
32
An Aggressing 
Order and an incoming order to buy 
(sell) will be automatically executed to 
the extent that it is priced at an amount 
that equals or exceeds (is less than) any 
order to sell (buy) on the MIAX Pearl 
Equities Book and is executable. Such 
order to buy (sell) will be matched for 
execution against sell (buy) orders 
resting on the MIAX Pearl Equities Book 
according to the price-time priority 
ranking of the resting orders. 
Exchange Rule 2617(a)(4)(iii) provides 
that certain orders, based on their 
operation and User instructions, are 
permitted to post and rest on the MIAX 
Pearl Equities Book at prices that lock 
or cross contra-side liquidity, provided, 
however, that the System
33
will never 
display a locked or crossed market.
34
 
Exchange Rule 2617(a)(4)(iii) further 
provides that if an Aggressing Order or 
an incoming order to buy (sell) would 
execute upon entry against an order to 
sell (buy) at the same or worse price as 
a displayed order to buy (sell), the 
Aggressing Order or incoming order to 
buy (sell) would be cancelled or posted 
to the MIAX Pearl Equities Book and 
ranked in accordance with Exchange 
Rule 2616. 
Again, one byproduct of the Post Only 
order instruction, and the MEQ 
instruction discussed above, is that they 
may result in the order posting to the 
MIAX Pearl Equities Book at a price that 
results in an internally locked or 
crossed market on the Exchange where 
one or both of the locking or crossing 
orders are non-displayed.
35
In the 
context of an order with a Post Only 
instruction, this may happen where an 
order does not remove all contra-side 
marketable resting liquidity pursuant to 
the Exchange’s economic best interest 
functionality under Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2) and is, therefore, posted to 
the MIAX Pearl Equities Book. 
As discussed above, based on the 
Exchange’s expertise, experience and 
data set forth above, the Exchange does 
not anticipate that expanding the Post 
Only instruction to sub-dollar securities 
would cause anything other a potential 
de minimis increase, if any, of internally 
non-displayed locked or crossed 
markets on the Exchange. Based on the 
Exchange’s observations and 
experience, in the rare event that an 
internally non-displayed locked or 
crossed book on Exchange does occur, 
such instances are typically alleviated 
almost immediately or within extremely 
short period of time of their initial 
occurrence. 
In the rare occurrence an internally 
non-displayed locked or crossed market 
does occur, the Exchange has method to 
resolve such instances in a manner that 
honors intra-market price priority. This 
mechanism is set forth under Exchange 
Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv), which governs the 
price at which a non-displayed order is 
executable when there is a contra-side 
displayed order at a price that results in 
an internally locked or crossed book. 
Today, for securities priced equal to or 
greater than $1.00 per share, in the case 
where a non-displayed order to sell 
(buy) is posted on the MIAX Pearl 
Equities Book at a price that locks a 
displayed order to buy (sell) pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 2617(a)(4)(iii) described 
above, an Aggressing Order or an 
incoming order to buy (sell) described 
in Exchange Rules 2617(a)(4)(i) and (ii) 
that is a Market Order or a Limit Order 
priced more aggressively than the order 
to buy (sell) displayed on the MIAX 
Pearl Equities Book, that Aggressing 
Order or incoming order will execute 
against the non-displayed order to sell 
(buy) resting on the MIAX Pearl Equities 
Book at one-half minimum price 
variation
36
greater (less) than the price 
of the resting displayed order to buy 
(sell).

context of a non-displayed locked or crossed market 
created by minimum execution quantity order 
types). 
40
See supra note 13. 
41
The Exchange notes that internally locked or 
crossed markets may occur on Nasdaq due to orders 
with a minimum quantity requirement or where one 
side of the market is non-displayed. In the scenario 
set forth in the above example, as well as similar 
scenario set forth in the below examples, the 
Exchange understands that during an internally 
locked or crossed market Nasdaq would execute 
Orders 1 and 3 at the locking price of $16.11. The 
Exchange believes it is preferential to execute these 
orders at a price other than the locking price 
because doing so honors the first principle of intra- 
market price priority, namely that a resting order to 
buy (sell) will not be eligible to trade: (i) at a price 
equal to or above (below) any sell (buy) displayed 
orders that have a ranked price equal to or below 
(above) the price of such resting buy (sell) order, as 
discussed above. 
amend Exchange Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv) to 
remove the phrase ‘‘for securities priced 
equal to or greater than $1.00 per share’’ 
and, therefore, provide the same 
behavior for bids or offers in securities 
priced below $1.00 per share as the 
Exchange does today for securities 
priced at or above $1.00 when executing 
orders during times when the Exchange 
is experiencing a non-displayed 
internally locked or crossed book. 
Exchange Rule 2616 sets forth the 
priority among orders resting on the 
MIAX Pearl Equities Book and there is 
no priority relationship between an 
incoming order and a same side resting 
order up to and until each order is 
resting on the MIAX Pearl Equities 
Book.
38
It is also well established that in 
the case of both an incoming order or 
between resting orders (as in the case 
when one order is an Aggressing Order) 
that, to comply with intra-market price 
priority, a resting order to buy (sell) will 
not be eligible to trade: (1) at a price 
equal to or above (below) any sell (buy) 
displayed orders that have a ranked 
price equal to or below (above) the price 
of such resting buy (sell) order; or (2) at 
a price above (below) any sell (buy) non- 
displayed order that has a ranked price 
below (above) the price of such resting 
buy (sell) order.
39
This behavior also 
allows the Exchange to manage an 
internally locked book while continuing 
to honor each order’s instructions while 
working to alleviate this infrequent, but 
abnormal market occurrence, and 
maintain a fair and orderly market. 
In keeping with the above principles, 
the Exchange would apply the same 
standards to securities priced below 
$1.00 as it does today for securities 
priced at or above $1.00 under Exchange 
Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv). In doing so, the 
Exchange would honor intra-market 
price priority by preventing an 
incoming or Aggressing Order from 
executing at the same price as a same- 
side displayed order on the MIAX Pearl 
Equities Book. 
This portion of the proposal is an 
expansion of existing rules and 
functionality available to securities 
priced at or above $1.00, and therefore, 
does not raise any new or novel issues 
not already considered by the 
Commission.

Exchange would handle securities 
priced below $1.00 pursuant to

Securities Priced at or Above $1.00 
(Current Behavior) 
The following examples illustrate 
how the Exchange handles securities 
priced at or above $1.00 pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv) for both 
incoming orders as well as when the 
Exchange reevaluates the MIAX Pearl 
Equities Book due to an external event, 
such as a change to the Limit Up-Limit 
Down (‘‘LULD’’) Price Bands and an 
Aggressing Order executes against 
contra-side interest. 
Incoming Order 
Assume the PBBO was $16.10 by 
$16.11 resulting in a midpoint of 
$16.105. An order to buy at $16.11 is 
resting non-displayed on the MIAX 
Pearl Equities Book (‘‘Order 1’’). A 
displayed Limit Order to sell at $16.11 
designated as Post Only is subsequently 
entered (‘‘Order 2’’). Assume that Order 
2 will not remove any liquidity upon 
entry pursuant to the Exchange’s 
economic best interest functionality 
under Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2), and 
will post to the MIAX Pearl Equities 
Book and be displayed at $16.11. The 
display of Order 2 will, in turn, make 
the resting Order 1 not executable at 
$16.11. An incoming order to sell at 
$16.10 is then entered (‘‘Order 3’’). 
Order 3 will execute against Order 1 at 
$16.105 per share upon entry, thus 
providing a half-penny of price 
improvement as compared to the Order 
1’s limit price of $16.11.
41
 
The following example describes 
where the execution occurs at a sub- 
penny price that is not at the midpoint 
of the PBBO. Assume the PBBO is 
$16.08 by $16.10 resulting in a midpoint 
of $16.09. An order to sell at $16.08 is 
resting non-displayed on the MIAX 
Pearl Equities Book (‘‘Order 1’’). A 
displayed Limit Order to buy at $16.08 
designated as Post Only is subsequently 
entered (‘‘Order 2’’). Assume that Order 
2 will not remove any liquidity upon 
entry pursuant to the Exchange’s 
economic best interest functionality 
under Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2), and 
will post to the MIAX Pearl Equities 
Book and be displayed at $16.08. The 
display of Order 2 will, in turn, make 
Order 1 not executable at $16.08. An 
incoming order to buy at $16.09 is 
entered (‘‘Order 3’’). Order 1 will 
execute against Order 3 at $16.085 per 
share, thus providing a half-penny of 
price improvement as compared to the 
Order 1’s limit price of $16.08. 
Re-Evaluation of MIAX Pearl Equities 
Book Due to External Event 
Assume the PBBO is $50.00 by 
$53.00, and the LULD Price Bands 
disseminated by the applicable SIP are 
$49.00 by $50.00. A non-displayed 
Limit Order to sell at $50.07 is entered 
and placed on the MIAX Pearl Equities 
Book (‘‘Order 1’’). Then, a displayed 
Limit Order to buy at $50.07 with a Post 
Only instruction is entered (‘‘Order 2’’). 
Order 2 cannot execute against Order 1 
and remove liquidity upon entry 
because of the LULD Price Bands, which 
result in Order 2 being posted to the 
MIAX Pearl Equities Book and re-priced 
to $50.00, the upper LULD Price Band 
pursuant to Exchange Rule 
2622(h)(2)(A)5.b. The Exchange BBO is 
now $50.00 by $50.07. Then, a 
displayed Limit Order to buy at $50.08 
is entered and is also re-priced to 
$50.00, the upper LULD Price Band 
pursuant to Exchange Rule 
2622(h)(2)(A)5.b (‘‘Order 3’’). The LULD 
Price Bands disseminated by the 
applicable SIP are then updated to 
$48.00 by $51.00, causing the Exchange 
to evaluate its book for potential 
executions. First, Order 2 is re-priced to 
$50.07, resulting in an internally non- 
displayed locked book. Order 2, the 
Aggressing Order, cannot execute 
against Order 1 and remove liquidity 
upon entry pursuant to the Exchange’s 
economic best interest functionality 
under Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2). Order 
3 is then evaluated and executes against 
Order 1 at $50.075, providing one-half 
minimum price increment of price

improvement as compared to the order’s 
limit price of $50.07. 
Securities Priced Below $1.00 
(Proposed) 
As stated above, the Exchange 
proposes to treat all securities the same 
pursuant to Exchange Rule 
2617(a)(4)(iv) regardless of price. The 
following example illustrates this 
behavior and describes how the 
Exchange would handle securities 
priced below $1.00 in the same manner 
as securities priced at or above $1.00 
pursuant to amended Exchange Rule 
2617(a)(4)(iv) for both incoming orders 
as well as how an Aggressing Order 
would behave when the Exchange 
reevaluates the MIAX Pearl Equities 
Book due to an external event, such as 
a change to the Limit Up-Limit Down 
Price Bands. 
Incoming Order 
The following examples illustrates 
how the Exchange handles securities 
priced below $1.00 pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv). 
Example No. 1 
Assume the PBBO is $0.500 by $0.502 
resulting in a midpoint of $0.501. A 
Midpoint Peg Order to sell at $0.501 is 
resting non-displayed on the MIAX 
Pearl Equities Book at $0.501, which is 
also the midpoint of the PBBO (‘‘Order 
1’’). A displayed Limit Order to buy 50 
shares at $0.501 designated as Post Only 
is subsequently entered (‘‘Order 2’’). 
Order 2 is an odd lot size and does not 
result in an update to the PBBO. Order 
2 will not remove any liquidity upon 
entry pursuant to the Exchange’s 
economic best interest functionality 
under Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2) because 
it would not receive the requisite price 
improvement, and will post to the 
MIAX Pearl Equities Book and be 
displayed at $0.501. The display of this 
order will, in turn, result in an 
internally locked book and make Order 
1 not executable at $0.501. If an 
incoming order to buy is entered into 
the MIAX Pearl Equities Book at a price 
of $0.5011 (‘‘Order 3’’), Order 1, 
originally priced at $0.501, will execute 
against Order 3 at $0.50105 per share, 
thus providing one-half minimum price 
increment of price improvement as 
compared to the order’s pegged price 
(i.e. midpoint of PBBO), which also equaled its limit price, of $0.501. 
Example No. 2 
The following example is a variation 
of the above example. Assume the PBBO 
is $0.50 by $0.53. A non-displayed 
Limit Order to sell at $0.5003 is entered 
and placed on the MIAX Pearl Equities 
Book (‘‘Order 1’’). Then, a displayed 
Limit Order to buy with a Post Only 
instruction at $0.5007 (‘‘Order 2’’) is 
entered. Order 2 cannot execute against 
Order 1 and remove liquidity upon 
entry pursuant to the Exchange’s 
economic best interest functionality 
under Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2) because 
it would not receive the requisite price 
improvement.
42
Therefore, Order 2 will 
post to the MIAX Pearl Equities Book 
and be displayed at $0.5007. As a result, 
Order 1 will be re-priced to $0.5007, the 
price of the displayed contra-side order, 
Order 2, pursuant to proposed Exchange 
Rule 2614(c)(2)(1)(A) discussed above, 
resulting in an internally non-displayed 
locked book. Then, a displayed Limit 
Order to buy at $0.5008 is entered and 
executes against Order 1 at $0.50075, 
providing one-half minimum price 
increment of price improvement as 
compared to the order’s limit price of 
$0.5007. However, if Order 3 was an 
order to sell, it would execute against 
Order 2 at $0.5007, Order 2’s displayed 
price. 
Example No. 3 
The following example describes 
when the execution occurs at a sub- 
penny price that is not at the midpoint 
of the PBBO. Assume the PBBO is 
$0.5000 by $0.5030 resulting in a 
midpoint of $0.5015. An order to sell at 
$0.5020 is resting non-displayed on the 
MIAX Pearl Equities Book. A displayed 
Limit Order to buy at $0.5020 
designated as Post Only is subsequently 
entered. Assume that the displayed 
order to buy designated as Post Only 
will not remove any liquidity upon 
entry pursuant to the Exchange’s 
economic best interest functionality 
under Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2), and 
will post to the MIAX Pearl Equities 
Book and be displayed at $0.5020. The 
display of this order will, in turn, result 
in an internally non-displayed locked 
book and make the resting non- 
displayed order to sell not executable at 
$0.5020. If an incoming order to buy is 
entered into the MIAX Pearl Equities 
Book at a price equal to or greater than 
$0.5021, the resting non-displayed order 
to sell originally priced at $0.5020 will 
execute against the incoming order to 
buy at $0.50205 per share, thus 
providing one-half minimum price 
increment of price improvement as 
compared to the order’s limit price of 
$0.5020. 
Example No. 4 
The following example describes 
when the execution occurs when the 
Exchange is experiencing an internally 
crossed market due to two contra-side 
non-displayed orders. Assume the 
PBBO is $0.5000 by $0.5030 resulting in 
a midpoint of $0.5015. An order to buy 
at $0.5003 is resting non-displayed on 
the MIAX Pearl Equities Book (‘‘Order 
1’’). A non-displayed Limit Order to sell 
at $0.5000 designated as Post Only is 
subsequently entered (‘‘Order 2’’). 
Assume Order 2 will not remove any 
liquidity upon entry pursuant to the 
Exchange’s economic best interest 
functionality under Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2), and will post to the MIAX 
Pearl Equities Book non-displayed at 
$0.5000. This will, in turn, result in an 
internally non-displayed crossed book 
of $0.5003 by $0.5000. An incoming 
order to sell is entered into the MIAX 
Pearl Equities Book at a price equal to 
or less than $0.5000 will execute against 
Order 1 at $0.5003. 
Re-Evaluation of MIAX Pearl Equities 
Book Due to External Event 
Assume the PBBO is $0.50 by $0.53, 
and the LULD Price Bands disseminated 
by the applicable SIP are $0.49 by $0.50. 
A non-displayed Limit Order to sell at 
$0.5003 is entered and placed on the 
MIAX Pearl Equities Book (‘‘Order 1’’). 
Then, a displayed Limit Order to buy 
with a Post Only instruction to buy at 
$0.5007 (‘‘Order 2’’). Order 2 cannot 
execute against Order 1 due to the LULD 
Price Bands which cause Order 2 to be 
posted to the MIAX Pearl Equities Book 
and re-priced to $0.50, the upper LULD 
Price Band pursuant to Exchange Rule 
2622(h)(2)(A)5.b. The Exchange BBO is 
now $0.50 by $0.5003. Then, a 
displayed Limit Order to buy at $0.5008 
is entered and is also re-priced to $0.50, 
the upper LULD Price Band pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 2622(h)(2)(A)5.b (‘‘Order 
3’’). The LULD Price Bands 
disseminated by the applicable SIP are 
then updated to $0.48 by $0.51, causing 
the Exchange to evaluate its book for 
potential executions. First, Order 2 is re- 
priced to $0.5007 and cannot execute 
against Order 1 and remove liquidity 
pursuant to the Exchange’s economic 
best interest functionality under 
Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2). As a result, 
Order 1 will be re-priced to $0.5007, the 
price of the displayed contra-side order, 
Order 2 pursuant to proposed Exchange 
Rule 2614(c)(2)(1)(A) discussed above, 
resulting in an internally non-displayed 
locked book. Order 2, the Aggressing 
Order, cannot execute against Order 1 
and remove liquidity upon entry 
pursuant to the Exchange’s economic

executes against Order 1 at $0.50075, 
providing one-half minimum price 
variation of price improvement as 
compared to the order’s limit price of 
$0.5007. 
Implementation 
Should the Commission approve this 
proposal, the Exchange will issue a 
trading alert publicly announcing the 
implementation date of the proposed 
amendments. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with Section 
6(b) of the Act,
43
in general, and furthers 
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5),
44
in 
particular, because it is designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative 
acts and practices, promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, foster 
cooperation and coordination with 
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, 
settling, processing information with 
respect to, and facilitating transactions 
in securities, remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Expanding Post Only Instruction to Sub- 
Dollar Securities 
In sum, the Exchange believes the 
proposed amendments to Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2) to extend the Post Only 
instruction to securities priced below 
$1.00 will remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system because it would provide for 
similar treatment to all orders in all 
securities regardless of price. This 
portion of the proposal also promotes 
just and equitable principles of trade 
because it will allow Equity Members to 
utilize the Post Only instruction on an 
order for a security at any price, rather 
than being limited to securities priced at 
or above $1.00. The Post Only 
instruction is an important tool in U.S. 
equities markets because it allows 
Equity Members to post aggressively 
priced liquidity, and provides certainty 
as to the fee or rebate that will be 
applied by the Exchange if their order 
is executed. Without such ability, the 
Exchange believes that certain Equity 
Members would simply post less 
aggressively priced liquidity, and prices 
available for market participants, 
including retail investors, may be 
adversely impacted. Orders with a Post 
Only instruction contribute to improved 
liquidity, market depth and, if 
displayed, price transparency. 
Expanding Post Only functionality to 
orders in sub-dollar securities would 
provide an additional exchange-level 
pool of liquidity for market participants 
that utilize Post Only functionality for 
sub-dollar securities. As such, the 
proposed rule change may encourage 
market participants to send additional 
sub-dollar trading volume to the 
Exchange, rather than the off-exchange 
marketplace, and, therefore, serve to 
improve on-exchange liquidity and 
price transparency in sub-dollar 
securities. Orders with a Post Only 
instruction entered on the Exchange 
could improve price transparency if the 
entering firm elected such order to be 
displayed and made available via an 
Exchange’s data feeds and disseminated 
by the applicable SIP. Allowing an order 
in a security priced below $1.00 to 
contain a Post Only instruction would 
also deepen the Exchange’s pool of 
available liquidity in sub-dollar 
securities, which is a growing area of 
trading, particularly for retail investors. 
A deeper and more liquid market 
supports the quality of price discovery, 
promotes market transparency, and 
improves market quality for all 
investors. 
As noted above, the Exchange 
adopted its current Post Only behavior 
as part of its broader proposal to adopt 
rules governing trading of equity 
securities, in which it sought to operate 
its equity market in a manner similar to 
that of other equity exchanges that it 
based its rules and functionality upon 
several years ago. This included 
adopting functionality that limited the 
availability of the Post Only instruction 
to orders in securities priced at or above 
$1.00. Again, and importantly, the 
Exchange did not adopt this limitation 
due to fear of some potential nefarious 
activity in sub-dollar securities trading, 
but rather due to lack of interest by 
market participants in such 
functionality at the time MIAX Pearl 
Equities was being developed and filing 
its initial rule set with the Commission 
for approval. 
This portion of the proposal also does 
not raise any new or novel issues as 
identical functionality is available on 
other equities exchanges. As discussed 
above, Nasdaq and their affiliated 
markets provide Post Only Orders to all 
securities regardless of price, which are 
posted, ranked, and displayed or posted 
non-displayed, as applicable, at their 
limit price upon entry. However, 
Nasdaq permits a Post-Only Order to 
execute upon entry if ‘‘the value of price 
improvement associated with executing 
against an Order on the Nasdaq Book (as 
measured against the original limit price 
of the Order) equals or exceeds the sum 
of fees charged for such execution and 
the value of any rebate that would be 
provided if the Order posted to the 
Nasdaq Book and subsequently 
provided liquidity’’.
45
This is analogous 
to the Exchange’s current behavior for 
orders with a Post Only instruction in 
securities priced at or above $1.00 as 
well as the Exchange’s proposed 
changes described herein for securities 
priced below $1.00. The NYSE and its 
affiliate exchanges also provide similar 
‘‘post only’’ functionality in the form of 
ALO orders, which is also available to 
securities priced below $1.00.
46
This 
portion of the Exchange’s proposal 
would remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open national market system because it 
seeks to expand the population of 
exchanges that offer ‘‘post only’’ 
treatment for securities priced below 
$1.00 by allowing the Exchange to 
provide an additional exchange-level 
pool of liquidity where market 
participants may send such orders. 
This proposal is designed to facilitate 
transactions in securities by increasing 
competition among exchanges for the 
currently available order flow in 
securities priced below $1.00 by 
ensuring that all order types and order 
instructions are available equally to all 
securities regardless of the order’s price. 
As explained above, providing ‘‘post 
only’’ treatment in securities priced 
below $1.00 should not increase the 
overall volume or order flow in sub- 
dollar securities but could encourage 
more aggressively priced liquidity, 
improve liquidity, market depth and, if 
displayed, price transparency in such 
securities. The Exchange believes this 
proposal will facilitate transactions in 
sub-dollar securities by increasing 
exchange competition by allowing the 
Exchange to provide functionality that 
would allow it to attract a greater slice 
of the current volume in sub-dollar 
securities, while also encouraging 
market participants to send their sub- 
dollar trading volume to an exchange- 
level pool of liquidity, rather than 
opaque off-exchange trading venues 
(i.e., dark pools), which are less transparent. Therefore, the Exchange 
believes this proposal will enhance 
exchange competition, facilitate 
transactions in sub-dollar securities, and 
not impose any burden on competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

https://memx.com/exchange-highlights-key-trading- 
trends-that-defined-another-banner-year-in-the- 
markets/. 
48
The Exchange notes that this functionality 
would also apply to orders in securities priced at 
or above $1.00 in the unlikely event that an 
incoming order in a security priced at or above 
$1.00 with a Post Only instruction would post to 
the MIAX Pearl Equities Book and result in an 
internally non-displayed crossed market. 
49
Exchange Rule 2614(c)(7)(B)(ii) provides that 
where there is insufficient size to satisfy the 
minimum quantity condition of an incoming order 
to buy (sell) and that incoming order, if posted at 
its limit price, would cross a displayed order to sell 
(buy) resting on the MIAX Pearl Equities Book, the 
order to buy (sell) with the MEQ instruction will 
have a working price equal to the price of the 
displayed order to sell (buy). 
50
This functionality is not unique and is similar 
to the Exchange’s current Non-Displayed Price 
Sliding Process where the Exchange re-prices a non- 
displayed order to buy (sell) that would cross the 
PBO (PBB) of an away Trading Center to the locking 
price. See Exchange Rule 2614(g)(2). The only difference being that the Exchange would re-price 
a non-displayed order, like it currently does for an 
order with a Minimum Execution Quantity 
instruction, that crosses the PBO (PBB) of the 
Exchange in addition to the PBO (PBB) of an away 
Trading Center. The Exchange also notes that both 
NASDAQ and IEX also re-price orders with a 
minimum quantity condition upon entry. See 
NASDAQ Rule 4703(e) and IEX Rule 11.190(h)(2). This proposal is not intended to 
encourage an increase in the overall 
volume or order flow in sub-dollar 
securities. Trading in sub-dollar 
securities both on- and off-exchange has 
grown significantly since the Exchange 
adopted Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2) and 
launched operations in September 2020. 
For example, average daily sub-dollar 
trading volume comprised 
approximately 9% of the overall daily 
volume in September 2025. In fact, the 
Exchange found that overall volume in 
sub-dollar securities has been slowly 
decreasing since June 2025 from 
approximately 14% to 9% in September 
2025. Meanwhile, off-exchange market 
share in sub-dollar securities remained 
high averaging over 60%.
47
 
As mentioned above, there are 
numerous factors that have contributed 
to the increase in sub-dollar trading 
volumes and approval of this proposal, 
alone, would not further encourage or 
contribute to an increase in sub-dollar 
trading volumes. Rather, the Exchange 
believes this proposal will remove 
impediments to a free and open market 
by increasing inter-market competition. 
The proposed changes will allow the 
Exchange to provide functionality to 
attract a greater slice of the current 
volume in sub-dollar securities by 
encouraging market participants to send 
their sub-dollar trading volume to 
another exchange-level pool of liquidity, 
rather than the opaque off-exchange 
trading venues (i.e., dark pools), which are less transparent. In addition, Equity 
Members recently requested the 
Exchange modify its Post Only 
instruction as proposed. The Exchange, 
therefore, believes this portion of the 
proposal is consistent with the Act. 
In addition, amended Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2) is not unfairly 
discriminatory, but rather promotes 
equal treatment of all Equity Members, 
as it will permit the Post Only 
instruction to be used by all Equity 
Members that submit orders for 
securities at any price and the order 
instruction will no longer be limited to 
securities priced at or above $1.00. 
Expanding Existing Functionality To 
Avoid or Alleviate Internally Locked or 
Crossed Markets to Securities Priced 
Below $1.00 With a Post Only 
Instruction 
As discussed above, differences exist 
between the market structures for 
securities priced at or above $1.00 and 
those below $1.00 that impact how the 
Post Only order instruction may 
function. This includes different fee 
levels and minimum price increments 
which could allow an order with a Post 
Only instruction to only result in an 
internally locked market in securities 
priced at or above $1.00 and both an 
internally locked or crossed market in 
securities priced below $1.00. Also, as 
discussed above, the Exchange reviewed 
its own data and found that internally 
locked and crossed markets are rare 
events and should continue to be rare 
under this proposal. Based on the 
Exchange’s expertise and experience, 
the Exchange anticipates that expanding 
the Post Only instruction to sub-dollar 
securities would cause at most, a 
potential de minimis, if any, increase of 
internally non-displayed locked or 
crossed markets on the Exchange. Also, 
based on the Exchange’s observations 
and experience, in the rare event such 
instances do occur, an internally non- 
displayed locked or crossed book is 
typically alleviated almost immediately 
or within extremely short period of time 
of their initial occurrence. 
Nonetheless, in the rare event they do 
occur, the Exchange has well 
established mechanisms to both avoid 
an internally locked or crossed market 
and to alleviate an internally locked or 
crossed market. This includes 
expanding current re-pricing 
functionality by adopting Exchange 
Rule 2614(c)(2)(i)(A) to reprice non- 
displayed orders in securities priced 
below $1.00 to the locking price of the 
displayed order resting on the MIAX 
Pearl Equities Book to help reduce the 
occurrence of an internally crossed 
book.
48
In addition, should an internally 
locked or crossed market occur, the 
Exchange has a current mechanism 
under Exchange Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv) to 
alleviate those occurrences while 
honoring intra-market price priority. 
Expanding this mechanism under 
Exchange Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv) to 
securities priced below $1.00 would 
allow for the Exchange to alleviate an 
internally locked or crossed book and 
would provide for the consistent 
treatment of all securities during an 
internally locked or crossed market, 
regardless of price. 
Re-Pricing Non-Displayed Orders to the 
Locking Price To Decrease the 
Occurrence of an Internally Crossed 
Market 
The Exchange believes proposed 
Exchange Rule 2614(c)(2)(i)(A) to re- 
price non-displayed orders to the 
locking price, including those with a 
Post Only instruction that would cross 
a contra-side displayed order promotes 
just and equitable principles of trade 
because it would serve to decrease the 
occurrence of the Exchange 
experiencing an abnormal market 
condition in the form of a non-displayed 
internally crossed book. The Exchange 
will never post a displayed or non- 
displayed order to the MIAX Pearl 
Equities Book at a price that would 
cross a contra-side displayed order. 
In addition, proposed Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2)(i)(A) is analogous to how the 
Exchange currently reprices orders with 
an MEQ instruction pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 2614(c)(7)(B)(ii).
49
The 
Exchange believes utilizing this re- 
pricing mechanism for sub-dollar 
securities with a Post Only instruction 
promotes just and equitable principles 
of trade because this functionality 
would be consistent with how the 
Exchange currently reprices orders with 
a MEQ instruction, which has 
previously been considered by the 
Commission.
50
This proposal simply 
seeks to expand such functionality 
without raising new discrimination 
concerns among orders below and above 
(or at) $1.00. Re-pricing non-displayed 
orders with a Post Only instruction to 
the locking price of the displayed order, 
as proposed, is appropriate and 
necessary to avoid an internally crossed 
market. Doing so in favor of the 
displayed order allows the displayed 
order to continue to contribute to price 
discovery at that price level while the 
non-displayed order does not provide

See Nasdaq Rule 4703(e). For example, Nasdaq Rule 4703(e) provides that if there was an order to 
buy at $11 with a minimum quantity condition of 
500 shares, and there were resting orders on the 
Nasdaq Book to sell 200 shares at $10.99 and 300 
shares at $11, the order would be repriced to $10.98 
and ranked at that price. 
52
See IEX Rule 11.190(h)(2). 53
This functionality is not unique and is similar 
to the Exchange’s current Non-Displayed Price 
Sliding Process where the Exchange re-prices a non- 
displayed order to buy (sell) that would cross the 
PBO (PBB) of an away Trading Center to the locking 
price. See Exchange Rule 2614(g)(2). The only difference being that the Exchange would re-price 
a non-displayed order, like it currently does for an 
order with a Minimum Execution Quantity 
instruction, that crosses the PBO (PBB) of the 
Exchange in addition to the PBO (PBB) of an away 
Trading Center. The Exchange also notes that both 
NASDAQ and IEX also re-price orders with a 
minimum quantity condition upon entry. See 
NASDAQ Rule 4703(e) and IEX Rule 11.190(h)(2). 
54
See, e.g., Exchange Rule 2614(c)(7)(ii)(C), NYSE 
Rule 7.31(i)(3)(C), and Cboe EDGX Rule 11.6(h) for a description of intra-market price priority in the 
context of a non-displayed locked or crossed market 
created by minimum execution quantity order 
types). 
like pre-trade price transparency. The 
Exchange’s rules would be clear as to 
when a non-displayed order may be re- 
priced to the locking price when there 
is contra-side displayed interest resting 
on the MIAX Pearl Equities Book and, 
thus, avoid an internally crossed 
market. Market participants who do not 
want their orders to be re-priced may 
enter the non-displayed order with a 
limit price that would prevent the order 
from being re-priced to an undesirable 
price level or those market participants 
may immediately cancel such order if 
they choose to do so. Equity Members 
are also free to choose which trading 
venues to route orders to and those that 
seek to avoid this functionality are free 
to route their non-displayed orders to 
another exchange. 
This is also analogous to the 
Exchange’s current Non-Displayed Price 
Sliding Process set forth under 
Exchange Rule 2614(g)(2) where the 
Exchange would also reprice a non- 
displayed order to the locking price. 
Pursuant to Exchange Rule 2614(g)(2), to 
avoid potentially trading through 
Protected Quotations of an away 
Trading Center, a non-displayed, non- 
routable order to buy (sell) that, upon 
entry or due to a change in the PBO 
(PBB), would cross the PBO (PBB) of an 
away Trading Center will be assigned a 
working price by the System equal to 
the PBO (PBB). Both IEX and Nasdaq re- 
price non-displayed orders to avoid an 
internally crossed market. In certain 
circumstances, Nasdaq re-prices non- 
displayed orders to buy (sell) to one 
minimum price increment below 
(above) the lowest (highest) price of 
resting orders to avoid an internally 
crossed market.
51
Likewise, IEX re- 
prices non-displayed orders that include 
a limit price more aggressive than the 
midpoint of the NBBO to the midpoint 
of the NBBO to prevent such orders 
from being posted at a price that crossed 
their midpoint of the NBBO.
52
The 
Exchange, therefore, believes that this 
portion of the proposal is consistent 
with the Act because it enables the 
Exchange to avoid an internally crossed 
book and is based on existing 
functionality in place on the Exchange 
and other equity exchanges to avoid 
internally crossed markets. The 
Exchange also believes re-pricing a non- 
displayed order as proposed herein 
promotes just and equitable principles 
of trade because it seeks to avoid an 
abnormal market condition, i.e., an internally crossed book, in favor of an 
order with the Post Only instruction 
that could represent more aggressively 
priced liquidity and price improvement 
opportunities for other contra-side 
orders. Like the Exchange provides 
today for orders with an MEQ 
instruction, Equity Members would be 
immediately notified if their order is re- 
priced as proposed herein and may re- 
enter such order with a new price if 
they choose to do so. The Exchange, 
therefore, believes the proposed changes 
do not raise any new or novel issues not 
already considered by the Commission. 
The Exchange believes it is 
appropriate and not unfairly 
discriminatory to reprice the non- 
displayed order as proposed above, and 
consistent with how it currently 
reprices orders with a MEQ instruction, 
which has previously been considered 
by the Commission.
53
This proposal 
simply seeks to expand such 
functionality without raising new 
discrimination concerns. Re-pricing 
non-displayed orders with a Post Only 
instruction to the locking price of the 
displayed order, as proposed, is 
appropriate and necessary to avoid an 
internally crossed market. Doing so in 
favor of the displayed order allows the 
displayed order to continue to 
contribute to price discovery at that 
price level while the non-displayed 
order does not provide like pre-trade 
price transparency. The Exchange’s 
rules would be clear as to when a non- 
displayed order may be re-priced to the 
locking price when there is contra-side 
displayed interest resting on the MIAX 
Pearl Equities Book and, thus, avoid an 
internally crossed market. Market 
participants who do not want their 
orders to be re-priced may enter the 
non-displayed order with a limit price 
that would prevent the order from being 
re-priced to an undesirable price level 
or those market participants may 
immediately cancel such order if they 
choose to do so. Equity Members are 
also free to choose which trading venues 
to route orders to and those that seek to 
avoid this functionality are free to route 
their non-displayed orders to another 
exchange. 
Expanding Current Internally Locked or 
Crossed Book Order Handling To 
Alleviate an Internally Locked or 
Crossed Market to Securities Priced 
Below $1.00 
The occurrence of a non-displayed 
internally locked or crossed market on 
the Exchange is an extremely rare 
occurrence, and the Exchange does not 
anticipate that this proposal would 
cause anything more than a potential de 
minimis increase, if any. Should they 
occur, the Exchange has an effective 
mechanism in place today for securities 
priced at or above $1.00 that it simply 
seeks to expand to securities priced 
below $1.00 to alleviate an internally 
locked or crossed book. Specifically, 
expanding Exchange Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv) 
to securities priced below $1.00 would 
facilitate transactions in securities 
during the extremely rare occurrence of 
a non-displayed internally locked or 
crossed market where a resting contra- 
side displayed order would otherwise 
prohibit such order from execution 
against an incoming or Aggressing Order 
by allowing an execution at one-half 
minimum price variation greater (less) 
than the price of the resting displayed 
order to buy (sell), as set forth in the 
Rule. In doing so, the proposal would 
also provide that all orders, regardless of 
price, are executable at the applicable 
one-half minimum price increment 
during a non-displayed internally 
locked or crossed market, while also 
ensuring that the Exchange continues to 
honor the intra-market price priority of 
all orders in such circumstances. 
As discussed above, the principle of 
intra-market price priority provides that, 
in the case of both an incoming order or 
between resting orders that a resting 
order to buy (sell) will not be eligible to 
trade: (1) at a price equal to or above 
(below) any sell (buy) displayed orders 
that have a ranked price equal to or 
below (above) the price of such resting 
buy (sell) order; or (2) at a price above 
(below) any sell (buy) non-displayed 
order that has a ranked price below 
(above) the price of such resting buy 
(sell) order.
54
The Exchange proposes to 
apply the same intra-market price 
priority standards to securities priced 
below $1.00 as it does today for 
securities priced at or above $1.00 under 
Exchange Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv). Doing so 
would ensure the Exchange continues to

The increase in sub-dollar trading volume has 
not been due to any new or novel exchange order 
types, but rather increased retail participation, 
especially since the Covid-19 pandemic and social 
media fueled hype; rise of off-exchange trading, 
including dark pools; reverse stock splits; and high 
market volatility causing prices to fall and making 
them prone to trading below $1.00. See, e.g., U.S. 
Equities Volume Drivers: Retail Trading in 
Subdollar Securities, dated November 24, 2024, 
available at https://www.cboe.com/insights/posts/u- 
s-equities-volume-drivers-retail-trading-in-

honor intra-market price priority in 
securities priced below $1.00 by 
preventing an incoming or resting order 
from executing at the same or better 
price as a displayed order or same price 
as a non-displayed order resting on the 
MIAX Pearl Equities Book. In doing so, 
the Exchange would not violate intra- 
market price priority for sub-dollar 
securities when trading out of an 
internally locked or crossed market. 
This portion of the proposal would 
allow the Exchange to treat orders in 
securities below $1.00 in a similar 
manner as securities priced at or above 
$1.00, thereby providing market 
participants with consistent handing of 
all orders regardless of price. This order 
handling is necessary in order to 
address specific conditions that are 
present on the MIAX Pearl Equities 
Book when an order containing a Post 
Only instruction is displayed opposite 
the ranked price of a non-displayed 
order resulting in an internally locked 
or crossed book. The proposal would 
also facilitate transactions in securities 
by making orders eligible for execution 
where a resting contra-side displayed 
order would otherwise prohibit such 
order from execution against an 
incoming or Aggressing Order. 
In sum, this would allow all orders to 
be treated in a similar manner, 
regardless of price by providing, under 
limited circumstances, a resting order 
priced below $1.00 that would 
otherwise be non-executable due to the 
presence of a displayed order, including 
a displayed order containing a Post 
Only instruction. Pursuant to Exchange 
Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv) an order that is 
currently unable to execute at the 
locking price due to the presence of a 
contra-side displayed order would be 
eligible to execute against an incoming 
order priced more aggressively than the 
contra-side displayed order at one-half 
minimum price increment above 
(below) the locking price. 
For the reasons set forth above, the 
Exchange believes amended Exchange 
Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv) is consistent with the 
Act because it would allow the 
Exchange to facilitate transactions in 
securities, honor intra-market price 
priority, and alleviate an internally non- 
displayed locked or crossed book that 
may occur due to expanding the 
availability of the Post Only instruction 
to securities priced below $1.00. The 
current one-half minimum price 
increment functionality for securities 
priced at or above $1.00 under Exchange 
Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv) has in fact been 
approved repeatedly by the Commission 
in the past and that identical 
functionality should be expanded to 
cover securities priced below $1.00.
55
 
The Exchange simply seeks to expand 
this functionality to securities priced 
below $1.00, therefore, believes its 
proposal is consistent with Section 
6(b)(5) of the Act. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
Intra-Market Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on intra-market competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
The proposed changes to Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2) will apply equally to all 
Equity Members and all Equity 
Members will be eligible to utilize the 
Post Only instruction for securities 
priced below $1.00, just as they do 
today for securities priced at or above 
$1.00. 
Similarly, the proposed change to 
Exchange Rule 2617(a)(4)(iv) applies 
similarly to all Equity Members because 
the proposed order handling behavior 
changes abide by the principles of intra- 
market price priority and will treat all 
securities in a similar fashion, 
regardless of price. Each proposed 
change is designed to expand an 
existing Exchange order instruction and 
existing order handling behavior to 
securities priced below $1.00, with no 
change, due to the growth in sub-dollar 
trading volumes that the Exchange has 
experienced since in launched 
operations in September 2020. 
Proposed Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2)(i)(A) to re-price to the locking 
price of non-displayed orders, including 
those with a Post Only instruction, that 
would cross a contra-side displayed 
order is similar to how the Exchange 
currently reprices orders with a MEQ 
instruction pursuant to Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(7)(B)(ii). This portion of the 
proposal simply seeks to provide 
consistent treatment of similarly 
situated orders and should not impose 
any burden on intra-market competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
Overall, the Exchange believes its 
proposal will not impose any burden on 
intra-market competition because the 
proposed functionality would be 
available to all Equity Members who 
may choose to utilize the proposed 
change based on their own business 
decisions and trading behaviors. 
Inter-Market Competition 
The Exchange similarly does not 
believe that the proposed rule change 
will impose any burden on inter-market 
competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. In fact, the 
Exchange notes other national equities 
exchanges already offer identical ‘‘post 
only’’ treatment of orders priced below 
$1.00.
56
There are numerous other 
factors that contribute to sub-dollar 
trading volumes, the majority of which 
occurs off-exchange.
57
This proposal 
would expand the population of 
exchanges that offer ‘‘post only’’ 
treatment for securities priced below 
$1.00 and would not only allow the 
Exchange to compete with exchanges 
that currently offer such functionality to 
sub-dollar securities, but also enable the 
Exchange to provide an additional 
exchange-level pool of liquidity where 
market participants may send such 
orders. The Exchange believes this 
proposal will increase exchange 
competition by allowing the Exchange 
to provide functionality that would 
allow it to attract a greater slice of the 
current volume in sub-dollar securities

by encouraging market participants to 
send their sub-dollar trading volume to 
an exchange-level pool of liquidity, 
rather than the opaque off-exchange 
trading venues (i.e., dark pools), which are less transparent. The Exchange 
believes its proposal to expand the use 
of the Post Only instruction to securities 
priced below $1.00 will promote 
competition between the Exchange and 
other exchanges for volume in sub- 
dollar securities. 
The Exchange similarly believes that 
its proposal to amend Exchange Rule 
2617(a)(4)(iv) does not impose a burden 
on inter-market competition as the 
change is not designed to address any 
competitive issue, but rather to address 
order handling behavior in a similar 
manner to how the Exchange treats 
orders priced at or above $1.00 while 
continuing to abide by the above stated 
principles of intra-market price priority. 
Proposed Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(2)(i)(A) to re-price to the locking 
price of a non-displayed orders, 
including those with a Post Only 
instruction, that would cross a contra- 
side is similar to how the Exchange 
currently reprices orders with a 
Minimum Execution Quantity 
instruction pursuant to Exchange Rule 
2614(c)(7)(B)(ii). This portion of the 
proposal simply seeks to provide 
consistent treatment of similarly 
situated orders and should not impose 
any burden on inter-market competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Rule 11.9(c)(8) to clarify Pegged Order 
operation and to align BYX Rules with 
the rules of its affiliate exchanges in 
order to provide consistency amongst 
the Exchange and its affiliates. The 
Exchange notes that the proposed rule 
text is based on EDGA/EDGX Rule 
11.6(j) and is different only to the extent 
necessary to conform to the Exchange’s 
current rules.
5
The proposed 
amendment does not propose to 
implement new or unique functionality 
that has not been previously filed with 
the Commission or is not available on 
EDGA or EDGX. 
By way of background, Exchange Rule 
11.9, Orders and Modifiers, lists and 
describes the types of orders Users
6
 
may enter into the System,
7
including 
Pegged Orders as described in Exchange 
Rule 11.9(c)(8). A Pegged Order
8
is a 
limit order that after entry into the 
System, the price of the order is 
automatically adjusted by the System in 
response to changes in the NBBO.
9
A 
Pegged Order will peg to the NBB or 
NBO or a certain amount away from the 
NBB
10
or NBO,
11
as described in 
Exchange Rules 11.9(c)(8)(A) and 
11.9(c)(8)(B). Pegged Orders are not 
eligible for routing pursuant to 
Exchange Rule 11.13(b).
12
A new time 
stamp is created for a Pegged Order each 
time it is automatically adjusted.
13
 
A Pegged Order may be a Primary 
Pegged Order or a Market Pegged 
Order.
14
A Primary Pegged Order will 
have its price pegged by the System to 
the NBB, for a buy order, or the NBO for 
a sell order.
15
A User may, but is not 
required to, specify that such order’s 
price will offset the inside quote on the 
same side of the market by an amount 
set by the User (the ‘‘Primary Offset 
Amount’’).
16
A Primary Pegged Order is 
eligible to be displayed or non- 
displayed, however, the Primary Offset 
Amount for a displayed Primary Pegged 
Order must result in the price of such 
order being inferior to or equal to the 
inside quote on the same side of the 
market.
17
A displayed Primary Pegged 
Order with a Primary Offset Amount 
shall only include a time-in-force of 
RHO,
18
or if entered during Regular 
Trading Hours,
19
a time-in-force of 
Day.
20
 
A Market Pegged Order has its price 
pegged by the System to the NBB, for a 
sell order, or the NBO, for a buy order.
21
 
A User entering a Market Pegged Order 
can specify that such order’s price will 
offset the inside quote on the contra side 
of the market by an amount set by the 
User (the ‘‘Offset Amount’’).
22
A Market 
Pegged Order is not eligible to be 
displayed on the Exchange.
23
 
Now, the Exchange proposes to 
amend the description of a Pegged 
Order under Rule 11.9(c)(8) to align 
with EDGA/EDGX Rule 11.6(j) and to 
clarify that a Pegged Order will not be 
eligible for execution where the NBB or 
NBO, as applicable, is no longer 
available. Further, the proposed rule 
text will provide that a new timestamp 
is created for an order that has been 
ineligible for execution and again 
becomes eligible for execution because 
the NBB or NBO it is pegged to becomes 
unavailable [sic]. 
Currently, when the NBB or NBO 
becomes unavailable, a Pegged Order is 
cancelled back to the User. As proposed, 
instead of being cancelled back to the 
User, a Pegged Order will remain on the 
BYX Book. When the NBB or NBO that 
the Pegged Order is pegged to becomes 
available again, the order will receive a 
new time stamp and be eligible for 
execution. The proposed rule change 
provides additional detail with regard to 
the operation of Pegged Orders when 
the NBB or NBO, as applicable, is 
unavailable, that is currently not 
included in Exchange Rule 11.9(c). This 
proposed rule change does not propose 
to implement new or unique 
functionality that has not been 
previously filed with the Commission or 
is not available on EDGA or EDGX. 
Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’) and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
24
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5)
25
requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged 
in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, 
and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
26
requirement that

17 CFR 240.19b–4(f)(6). 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The proposed rule change is designed to 
support the principles of Section 
11A(a)(1)
27
of the Act in that it seeks to 
assure fair competition among brokers 
and dealers and among exchange 
markets. 
The proposed rule change is intended 
to more thoroughly describe Pegged 
Order operation and to align BYX Rules 
with the rules of its affiliate exchanges 
in order to provide consistent offerings 
amongst the Exchange and its affiliates, 
which the Exchange believes is 
designed to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, thereby protecting investors and 
the public interest. Consistency amongst 
the rules of the Exchange and its 
affiliates, in turn, will promote rule 
compliance for Users of the Exchange 
that are also participants on EDGA and/ 
or EDGX. The proposed rule change 
does not propose to implement new or 
unique functionality that has not been 
previously filed with the Commission or 
is not described in the rules of its 
affiliate exchanges. By aligning BYX 
Rules with the rules of EDGA and 
EDGX, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change will remove 
impediments to the mechanism of a free 
and open market and protect investors 
by providing investors with increased 
transparency regarding rules that reflect 
the behavior of Pegged Order on the 
Exchange when the NBB or NBO, as 
applicable, becomes unavailable. As a 
result, the Exchange’s proposal will 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade and remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system. Additionally, the proposal does 
not permit unfair discrimination among 
customers, brokers, or dealers because 
the proposed Pegged Order behavior 
will apply to all Users equally in that 
any User’s Pegged Order will become 
non-executable in the event that the 
NBB or NBO, as applicable, becomes 
unavailable and a Pegged Order will 
receive a new timestamp when the NBB 
or NBO becomes available and the order 
again becomes eligible for execution. 
As described above, the proposed 
amendment is designed to ensure clarity 
in the Exchange’s rulebook with respect 
to the operation of Pegged Orders in the 
event that the NBB or NBO, as 
applicable, becomes unavailable. The 
Exchange notes that the proposed 
amendment is based on EDGA/EDGX 
Rule 11.6(j) and is different only to the 
extent necessary to conform to the 
Exchange’s current rules. Thus, the 
proposed amendment to Rule 11.9(c)(8) 
is directly targeted at removing 
impediments to and perfecting the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and national market system, as well as 
to assure fair competition among 
brokers and dealers and among 
exchange markets. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
Exchange notes that the proposed 
amendment to clarify Pegged Order 
behavior will provide consistent 
offerings amongst the Exchange and its 
affiliates. The Exchange does not believe 
the proposed change will have any 
impact on intermarket competition as 
the proposal is not being made for 
competitive reasons, but rather to align 
the text of BYX Rule 11.9(c)(8) with the 
corresponding rule text of its affiliate 
exchanges. In addition, the Exchange 
believes the proposed rule change will 
benefit all Users in that Users will have 
a more complete understanding of 
Pegged Order behavior when the NBB or 
NBO, as applicable, becomes 
unavailable. The proposed rule change 
will apply equally to all Users of Pegged 
Orders. 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed amendments will impose 
any burden on intra-market competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
The Exchange provides services in a 
highly competitive market in which 
participants may avail themselves of a 
wide variety of order types and order 
operations offered by self-regulatory 
organizations, other broker-dealers, 
market participants’ own proprietary 
routing systems, and service bureaus. In 
such an environment, more detailed 
descriptions of the types of orders Users 
may enter into the System, such as the 
changes proposed in this rule filing do 
not burden competition, because they 
can succeed in attracting order flow to 
the Exchange only if they offer investors 
higher quality and better value than 
services offered by others. The Exchange 
reiterates that the proposed rule change 
to clarify Pegged Order behavior is being 
proposed in an effort to add consistency 
to offerings across the Exchange and its 
affiliates. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received comments on the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: 
A. significantly affect the protection 
of investors or the public interest; 
B. impose any significant burden on 
competition; and 
C. become operative for 30 days from 
the date on which it was filed, or such 
shorter time as the Commission may 
designate, it has become effective 
pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the 
Act
28
and Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
29
 
thereunder. At any time within 60 days 
of the filing of the proposed rule change, 
the Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

Proposed Rule Change To Amend 
MSRB Rules A–11 and A–13 Pursuant 
to a Multi-Year Rate Card and To Make 
Related Technical Amendments 
December 19, 2025. 
I. Introduction 
On September 30, 2025, the 
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board 
(‘‘MSRB’’) filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’ or 
‘‘Commission’’), pursuant to Section 
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (‘‘Act’’ or ‘‘Exchange Act’’)
1
and 
Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
a proposed rule 
change to (i) amend MSRB Rule A–11, 
on assessments for municipal advisor 
professionals (‘‘Rule A–11’’), to 
establish new rates of certain 
assessments on municipal advisors 
pursuant to a multi-year rate card, (ii) 
amend MSRB Rule A–13, on 
underwriting and transaction 
assessments for brokers, dealers, and 
municipal securities dealers (‘‘Rule A– 
13’’), to establish new rates of certain 
assessments on brokers, dealers, and 
municipal securities dealers 
(collectively, ‘‘dealers’’ and, together 
with municipal advisors, ‘‘regulated 
entities’’) pursuant to a multi-year rate 
card, and (iii) make certain related 
technical amendments to Rules A–11 
and A–13 (collectively, the ‘‘proposed 
rule change’’).
3
 
The MSRB requested that the 
proposed rule change be approved with 
an effective date of January 1, 2026, 
provided that if approved by the 
Commission after January 1, 2026, the 
proposed rule change be made effective 
as of the first day of the month 
following Commission approval.
4
 
The proposed rule change was 
published for comment in the Federal 
Register on October 3, 2025.5
The 
Commission received four comment 
letters
6
on the proposed rule change. 
Pursuant to a notice published in the 
Federal Register on November 17, 2025, 
the date by which the Commission shall 
either approve or disapprove, or 
institute proceedings to determine 
whether to disapprove, the proposed 
rule change was extended from 
November 17, 2025, to January 1, 2026.
7
 
On December 2, 2025, the MSRB 
responded to the comment letters.
8
As 
described further below, the 
Commission is approving the proposed 
rule change with an effective date of 
January 1, 2026. 
II. Description of the Proposed Rule 
Change 
A. Background 
The MSRB established its annual rate 
card model in 2022.
9
Pursuant to the 
annual rate card model, in November 
2023, the MSRB filed with the 
Commission proposed amendments to 
Rules A–11 and A–13 to institute the 
rate card fees for 2024 (the ‘‘2024 Rate 
Card Proposal’’).
10
Five comment letters 
were submitted to the Commission in 
response to the 2024 Rate Card 
Proposal, all of which highlighted 
concerns, among others, related to the 
MSRB’s rate setting processes and the 
volatility and unpredictability of rates 
under the annual rate card model.
11
On 
January 29, 2024, the Commission 
temporarily suspended and instituted 
proceedings to determine whether to 
approve or disapprove the 2024 Rate 
Card Proposal.
12
The MSRB then 
withdrew the 2024 Rate Card Proposal 
on February 16, 2024.
13
 
Since withdrawing the 2024 Rate Card 
Proposal, the MSRB has reported that it 
has held outreach meetings with 
industry groups representing regulated 
entities and other stakeholders to 
discuss the MSRB’s budget and rate card 
process.
14
The MSRB also issued a 
Request for Information (‘‘RFI’’) on its 
rate card process on October 30, 2024, 
soliciting feedback from stakeholders on 
the MSRB’s rate setting process, the 
distribution of fees across regulated 
entities generally, and the MSRB’s 
management of its organizational 
reserve funds.
15
The MSRB received 
comments in response to the RFI, 
focusing on, among other matters, the 
volatility and unpredictability of the 
annual rate card model and strategies 
for management of reserve levels.
16
The 
MSRB subsequently revised its funding 
policy, effective October 1, 2025 
(‘‘Revised Funding Policy’’), to replace 
its annual rate setting process with a 
new multi-year rate setting process (the 
‘‘Multi-Year Rate Card Process’’).

See Notice, 90 FR at 48083. 19
See Notice, 90 FR at 48082–85. Underwriting assessments charged pursuant to Rule A–13(c) to 
dealers acting as underwriters of certain municipal 
fund securities are not included in the assessment 
rates that would be amended by this proposed rule 
change. See Notice, 90 FR at 48082, note 3. 20
See Notice, 90 FR at 48083–84. The Municipal Advisor Professional Fee included in the proposed 
new Rate Card Fees, for each year covered by the 
proposed rule change, would be set out in 
Supplementary Material .01 of Rule A–11. See 
Notice, 90 FR at 48084, note 14. Each of the Market 
Activity Fees included in the proposed new Rate 
Card Fees would be set out in Supplementary 
Material .01(a)(i)–(iii) of Rule A–13. See id. 
21
See Notice, 90 FR at 48084. 22
See id. As noted above, the Revised Funding 
Policy became effective as of October 1, 2025. Any 
future revisions to the Revised Funding Policy must 
be approved by the MSRB’s board of directors and 
would be posted on the MSRB website at https:// www.msrb.org/MSRB-Funding-Policy-1. See Notice, 
90 FR at 48084, note 17. Revisions to the Revised 
Funding Policy would not result in changes to the 
rates of filed Rate Card Fees absent a rule filing with 
the Commission, but instead would have an impact 
on future rate-setting through MSRB rulemaking. 
See id. The proposed rule change would amend 
Supplementary Material .01 to Rule A–11 and 
Supplementary Material .01(b) to Rule A–13 to 
delete language describing aspects of the prior rate 
setting process that would be superseded by the 
Multi-Year Rate Card Process, to explicitly state that 
if no new rate card is established at the end of the 
period covered by the proposed rule change then 
the applicable rates would remain at the same level 
as in effect prior to the end of that period, and to 
provide for the ongoing availability of the Revised 
Funding Policy, and any future revisions thereto, on 
the MSRB website so long as the Revised Funding 
Policy sets forth, in whole or in part, the MSRB’s 
rate card process. See id. 
23
See Notice, 90 FR at 48084. The Temporary Credits that would be applied to the Market 
Activity Fees included in the proposed new Rate 
Card Fees for the calendar years 2026 and 2027 
would be set out in Supplementary Material .01(c) 
of Rule A–13. See Notice, 90 FR at 48084, note 19. The Temporary Credits included in this proposed 
rule change would not apply to the Municipal 
Advisor Professional Fee. See Notice, 90 FR at 48084. The proposed rule change’s Temporary 
Credits apply to dealer Market Activity Fees 
because the MSRB’s excess reserves resulted from 
revenue derived from extraordinary market trading 
and issuance volume between 2023 and 2025. See Notice, 90 FR at 48086, note 40. 
24
See Notice, 90 FR at 48084. The net amount of Market Activity Fees, taking into account any 
applicable Temporary Credits, would be set out in 
Supplementary Material .01(c)(i)–(iii) of Rule A–13. 
See Notice, 90 FR at 48084, note 20. According to the MSRB, this Multi-Year 
Rate Card Process, the MSRB’s fiscal 
year 2026 budget, and the proposed rule 
change were developed after 
considering the RFI responses and 
feedback received from the MSRB’s 
outreach to stakeholders.
18
 
B. Summary of the Proposed Rule 
Change 
As discussed below and in the Notice, 
the proposed rule change would amend 
Rules A–11 and A–13 to establish new 
rates of certain assessments on 
municipal advisors under Rule A–11 
and dealers under Rule A–13 pursuant 
to the new Multi-Year Rate Card 
Process, as well as to make certain 
related technical amendments.
19
Rule 
A–11 currently requires municipal 
advisors to pay to the MSRB a recurring 
annual fee (the ‘‘Municipal Advisor 
Professional Fee’’) for each associated 
person qualified as a municipal advisor 
representative under MSRB Rule G–3 
and for whom the municipal advisor has 
on file with the Commission an active 
Form MA–I as of January 31 of the 
applicable year (‘‘covered 
professional’’). Rule A–13 currently 
requires dealers to pay (a) an 
underwriting fee under Rule A–13(b) 
(the ‘‘Underwriting Fee’’) for municipal 
securities purchased from an issuer by 
or through such dealer as part of a 
primary offering, (b) a transaction fee 
under Rule A–13(d)(i) and (ii) (the 
‘‘Transaction Fee’’) based on the par 
amount traded in inter-dealer trades and 
customer sales, and (c) a trade count fee 
under Rule A–13(d)(iv)(a) and (b) (the 
‘‘Trade Count Fee’’) based on the 
number of inter-dealer trades and 
customer sales (collectively, the 
‘‘Market Activity Fees,’’ and together 
with the Municipal Advisor 
Professional Fee, the ‘‘Rate Card Fees’’). 
Proposed Multi-Year Rate Card Fees 
The proposed rule change would 
establish Rate Card Fees for the next 
four calendar years: 2026, 2027, 2028, 
and 2029 (the ‘‘proposed Multi-Year 
Rate Card’’).
20
The Municipal Advisor 
Professional Fee included in the 
proposed Rate Card Fees for each of 
these years would be operative from 
January 1 of each calendar year until 
December 31 for that year and the 
Market Activity Fees included in the 
proposed Rate Card Fees would be 
operative from January 1, 2026 until 
December 31, 2029.
21
The proposed rule 
change would also require that any 
subsequent multi-year rate cards be 
established by amendment to Rules A– 
11 and A–13 and in accordance with the 
principles and guidelines of the MSRB’s 
Revised Funding Policy, available at 
https://www.msrb.org/MSRB-Funding- 
Policy-1.
22
 
Additionally, the proposed rule 
change would establish credits 
(‘‘Temporary Credits’’) of 45% applied 
to Market Activity Fees in 2026 and 
2027, which would result in a reduction 
in the amounts to be assessed to and 
paid by dealers for Market Activity Fees 
during such years.
23
The following table 
sets forth (a) the Rate Card Fees 
currently in effect under Rules A–11 
and A–13, and (b) the Rate Card Fees 
that the MSRB would establish under its 
proposed Multi-Year Rate Card, together 
with the net rates of assessment 
proposed for each year (taking into 
account the Temporary Credits):

fessional. Exhibit 5 of the MSRB’s Rule 19b–4 filing for the proposed rule change erroneously shows the current rate as $1,160 per covered 
professional.

See Notice, 90 FR at 48084. The Annual Rate Change Limit would be set out in Supplementary 
Material .01 of Rule A–11 and Supplementary 
Material .01(b) of Rule A–13. See Notice, 90 FR at 48084, note 23. 
26
See Notice, 90 FR at 48084. The Revised Funding Policy allows the MSRB to elect to utilize 
one or more Temporary Credits within the proposed 
Multi-Year Rate Card or in a future multi-year rate 
card. See Notice, 90 FR at 48085 (citing Revised Funding Policy, supra note 17, at ‘‘Organizational Reserves’’ and ‘‘Multi-Year Rate Card’’). If 
Temporary Credits are applied to a baseline Rate 
Card Fee, the Annual Rate Change Limit may be 
exceeded. See id. For example, the proposed rule change includes Temporary Credits during the first 
two years which result in the net rates of 
assessments for the Market Activity Fees increasing 
between 2027 and 2028 by more than the 
percentage of the Annual Rate Change Limit, 
notwithstanding the fact that the baseline rates 
would not change. See id. 
27
See Notice, 90 FR at 48084–85. 28
See Notice, 90 FR at 48085. 29
See id. The word ‘‘annual’’ would be removed 
in references to ‘‘annual rate card’’ in Rule A–11(b), 
Supplementary Material .01 to Rule A–11, Rule A– 
13(b), Rule A–13(d)(i)–(ii), Rule A–13(d)(iv)(a)–(b), 
and Supplementary Material .01 and .01(b). See Notice, 90 FR at 48085, note 32. 
30
See Notice, 90 FR at 48085. In the case of the Municipal Advisor Professional Fee, language 
would be added in Supplementary Material .01 to 
Rule A–11 to make explicit that the charge is based 
on the number of covered professionals in the 
respective year for which the fee is to be assessed, 
and the rates for each year would be listed in 
clauses (a)–(d) thereof. See Notice, 90 FR at 48085, note 33. The net rate of assessment of the Market 
Activity Fees for the first two years would be listed 
in Supplementary Material .01(c)(i)–(iii). See id.

49
See MSRB Letter at 3. 50
See MSRB Letter at 3–4. Multi-Year Rate Card Process 
As part of the new Multi-Year Rate 
Card Process, the proposed rule change 
would also establish a maximum annual 
increase or decrease in any baseline 
Rate Card Fee of 15% (the ‘‘Annual Rate 
Change Limit’’) within a multi-year rate 
card period (as compared to the annual 
25% cap on increases and no cap on 
decreases that are currently in effect),
25
 
subject to potential Temporary 
Credits.
26
 
The MSRB states that under the Rate 
Card Fees proposed in the proposed rule 
change, the baseline rates of the Market 
Activity Fees would remain unchanged 
both from the rates currently in effect 
under the prior rate card and throughout 
the course of the proposed Multi-Year 
Rate Card.
27
The MSRB further notes 
that the Municipal Advisor Professional 
Fee for 2026 would increase by 
approximately 6.6% from the rate 
currently in effect and would increase 
on an annual basis during the course of 
the proposed Multi-Year Rate Card by 
approximately 6% per year.
28
 
Related Technical Amendments 
The proposed rule change would 
include certain technical language 
changes. For example, references to the 
current ‘‘annual’’ process would be 
eliminated throughout Rules A–11 and 
A–13 and instead would reflect the four- 
year term of the proposed Multi-Year 
Rate Card in the proposed rule change.
29
 
The proposed rule change language 
would also refer to the rates that would 
be in effect (including any net rates due 
to Temporary Credits, as applicable) for 
each year within the course of the 
proposed Multi-Year Rate Card.
30
 
III. Summary of Comments Received 
and the MSRB’s Response 
The Commission received four 
comment letters
31
on the proposed rule 
change, as well as a response
32
from the 
MSRB to the comment letters. Three 
commenters expressed support for the 
proposed rule change,
33
one commenter 
stated that it did not oppose the 
proposed rule change,
34
and no 
commenters objected to the proposed 
rule change. 
One commenter expressed support for 
the proposed shift to a multi-year rate 
card, opining that it will improve the 
stability and predictability of rate card 
fees for regulated entities.
35
That 
commenter also stated that the MSRB 
should consider adopting an alternative 
fee structure applicable to municipal 
dealer operators of alternative trading 
systems.
36
In its response letter, the 
MSRB stated that it would engage in 
dialogue with stakeholders regarding 
potential alternative fee mechanisms for 
certain market participants.
37
 
One commenter expressed support for 
the proposed shift to a multi-year rate 
card but stated that it believes that a 
four-year fee window is probably too 
long to accurately predict market trends 
in issuance and trade volume as well as 
demands on MSRB resources, and a 
two-year window may be more 
appropriate.
38
The commenter also 
stated that the fees paid by municipal 
advisors are too small as a percentage of 
the MSRB’s revenue, and a market- 
activity based fee for municipal advisors 
would be appropriate.
39
The commenter 
also requested that the MSRB adopt a 
formalized process to periodically 
review its revenue throughout the 
proposed four-year fee-setting 
window.
40
In its response letter, the 
MSRB stated that it would engage in 
dialogue with stakeholders regarding 
the formulation of future charges, fees, 
and rate cards.
41
The MSRB also stated 
that it will conduct a periodic review of 
its organizational reserves target and 
will evaluate and consider actions if 
organizational reserves exceed or fall 
below the established target by 20% or 
greater, as required by the MSRB’s 
Revised Funding Policy.
42
 
One commenter expressed support for 
the lowered operational reserves target 
presented in the MSRB’s fiscal year 
2026 budget and the proposed shift to 
a multi-year rate card as reducing fee 
volatility and ensuring more 
predictability.
43
The commenter also 
urged the MSRB to consider increasing 
municipal advisor fees and/or imposing 
municipal advisor market activity fees 
in the future.
44
In its response letter, the 
MSRB stated that it would engage in 
dialogue with stakeholders regarding 
the formulation of future charges, fees, 
and rate cards.
45
 
One commenter stated that it did not 
oppose the proposed rule change and 
that the MSRB should not change its 
current approach of collecting fees from 
municipal advisors on a per-municipal 
advisor basis.
46
The commenter also 
stated that it supports the proposed 
four-year fee-setting window but 
expressed concern with how the MSRB 
will develop budgets during that four- 
year period to ensure that expenses 
adhere to its regulatory mandates under 
the Exchange Act so that fees are 
assessed on a reasonable basis.
47
The 
commenter also expressed a desire to 
engage in dialogue with the MSRB about 
recent changes to the MSRB’s Funding 
Policy, including the removal of 
language regarding the fair allocation of 
fee burdens on different classes of 
regulated entities.
48
In its response 
letter, the MSRB stated that it would 
engage in dialogue with stakeholders 
regarding the formulation of future 
charges, fees, and rate cards.
49
The 
MSRB also stated that it does not 
believe that its Revised Funding Policy 
diminishes the commitments laid out in 
its prior Funding Policy or alter any of 
the requirements imposed on the MSRB 
by statute.
50
 
The MSRB stated that it believes that 
it has undertaken a meaningful review

structure has occurred to warrant alteration of 
current target contribution levels. See Notice, 90 FR at 48086, note 40.

IV. Discussion and Commission 
Findings 
The Commission has carefully 
considered the proposed rule change, 
the comment letters received, and the 
MSRB’s response thereto. The 
Commission has also considered 
supplemental, non-public information 
regarding the MSRB’s expenses that the 
MSRB provided to the Commission at 
the Commission’s request. The 
Commission finds that the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
requirements of the Exchange Act and 
the rules and regulations thereunder 
applicable to the MSRB. In particular, 
the Commission finds that the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
provisions of Sections 15B(b)(2)(J),
52
 
3(f),
53
15B(b)(2)(C),
54
and 
15B(b)(2)(L)(iv)
55
of the Exchange Act. 
A. Reasonable Fees and Charges as May 
Be Necessary or Appropriate To Defray 
the Costs and Expenses of Operating 
and Administering the MSRB 
For the reasons outlined below, and 
in particular the MSRB’s commitment to 
the continued stakeholder outreach 
described below, the Commission finds 
that the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the provisions of 
Section 15B(b)(2)(J) of the Exchange 
Act.
56
Section 15B(b)(2)(J) of the 
Exchange Act requires the MSRB’s rules 
to provide that each regulated entity 
shall pay to the MSRB such reasonable 
fees and charges as may be necessary or 
appropriate to defray the costs and 
expenses of operating and administering 
the MSRB.
57
Such rules shall specify the 
amount of such fees and charges, which 
may include charges for failure to 
submit to the MSRB, or to any 
information system operated by the 
MSRB, within the prescribed 
timeframes, any items of information or 
documents required to be submitted 
under any rule issued by the MSRB.
58
 
As noted by the MSRB, the proposed 
rule change is designed to fund the 
operation and administration of the 
MSRB through the establishment of a 
fee structure that: (i) improves the 
stability and predictability of Rate Card 
Fees over time; (ii) maintains an 
appropriate balance of assessments on 
regulated entities; and (iii) improves the 
MSRB’s ability to manage organizational 
reserves responsibly while minimizing 
fee volatility and other operational 
disruptions to regulated entities.
59
The 
Commission finds that the proposed 
rule change represents a reasonable 
approach to achieve these goals by, 
among other changes, moving the 
process for determining Rate Card Fees 
from an annually calculated adjustment 
to a fixed multi-year rate schedule, 
establishing parameters to limit the 
degree of annual changes to Rate Card 
Fees (i.e., the Annual Rate Change Limit), establishing a framework to 
address surplus reserves through rate 
adjustments to Market Activity Fees 
(i.e., the Temporary Credits), and maintaining the MSRB’s target balance 
of Rate Card Fees between dealers and 
municipal advisors.
60
 
With respect to the proposed Multi- 
Year Rate Card, the Commission finds 
that the proposed Rate Card Fees are 
appropriate to defray the anticipated 
costs and expenses of operating and 
administering the MSRB over the next 
four years. The MSRB’s 2026 budgeted 
expenses total $46.2 million (a 5.2% 
decrease in expenses compared to its 
fiscal year 2025 budgeted expenses)
61
 
and the MSRB assumes an annual 
average expense growth rate of 3.4% for 
fiscal years 2027 through 2029, 
primarily due to the costs of inflation.
62
 
The MSRB anticipates the revenue from 
the proposed Rate Card Fees to 
represent 78% of total revenues in fiscal 
year 2026, with the remaining 22% of 
revenues comprised of data subscription 
fees, underwriting assessments for 
certain municipal fund securities 
offerings under MSRB Rule A–13(c), 
annual and initial fees under MSRB 
Rule A–12(b) and (c), investment 
income, fine revenue, and other 
miscellaneous revenue (including 
examination fees under MSRB Rule A– 
16).
63
Although the proposed rule 
change would also reduce the MSRB’s 
reserves balance through the use of a 
45% Temporary Credit for Market 
Activity Fees (as discussed above),
64
the 
MSRB maintains a targeted level of 
reserve funding in accordance with its 
Revised Funding Policy, which 
establishes a tolerance for variation from 
the organizational reserves target of 
+/¥20% of its target level (the ‘‘Reserve 
Target Tolerance’’), and provides for an 
evaluation, at the mid-point of a multi- 
year rate card, as to whether the Reserve 
Target Tolerance has been exceeded.
65
 
Finally, the MSRB stated that it 
developed its fiscal year 2026 budget, its 
Revised Funding Policy, and the 
proposed rule change after considering 
the RFI responses and feedback received 
from the MSRB’s outreach to 
stakeholders.
66
Based on commitments 
made by the MSRB,
67
the Commission 
expects that the MSRB will continue

See Notice, 90 FR at 48086–87. As noted above, the proposed rule change maintains the 
contribution targets set forth when the MSRB 
established its annual rate card process in 2022, 
which the MSRB believes remain appropriate as no 
durable, material shift in market structure has 
occurred to warrant alteration of current target 
contribution levels. See Notice, 90 FR at 48086, note 40.

See Notice, 90 FR at 48089. As noted above, the proposed rule change’s Temporary Credits apply to 
dealer Market Activity Fees because the MSRB’s

See Notice, 90 FR at 48089. such outreach, which is key to a 
determination by the Commission that 
the proposed rule change establishes 
reasonable fees and charges to be paid 
by regulated entities. Although the 
proposed Multi-Year Rate Card is a 
fixed rate schedule for its four-year term 
and is generally not intended to be 
modified during its effective term,
68
the 
MSRB has committed to continuing its 
stakeholder outreach during this four 
year term regarding the MSRB’s rate 
setting process, the distribution of fees 
across regulated entities generally, and 
the MSRB’s budget and management of 
its reserve funds.
69
Based on 
commitments made by the MSRB,
70
the 
Commission also expects that the MSRB 
will engage with the Commission and 
stakeholders regarding what additional 
data and information the MSRB should 
publicly disclose (that it does not 
currently publicly disclose) regarding 
the MSRB’s budget. The Commission 
also expects that, despite removing from 
its Revised Funding Policy certain 
previously included language affirming 
that stakeholder engagement is a 
funding priority of the MSRB,
71
the 
MSRB will engage with stakeholders to 
ensure that future budgets adhere to the 
MSRB’s regulatory mandates under the 
Exchange Act.
72
 
For these reasons, the Commission 
finds that the proposed rule change 
establishes reasonable fees and charges 
to be paid by regulated entities 
consistent with Section 15B(b)(2)(J) of 
the Exchange Act. 
B. Impact on Efficiency, Competition, 
and Capital Formation, and Related 
Provisions 
In approving the proposed rule 
change, the Commission has also 
considered the proposed rule change’s 
impact on efficiency, competition, and 
capital formation under Section 3(f) of 
the Exchange Act.
73
The Commission 
finds that the record for the proposed 
rule change does not contain any 
information to indicate that the 
proposed rule change would have a 
negative impact on efficiency, 
competition, or capital formation.
74
In 
fact, transitioning to the proposed 
Multi-Year Rate Card could promote 
market efficiency and capital formation 
because regulated entities will now 
know their Rate Card Fees through 2029 
instead of facing uncertainty under a 
one- or two-year rate card process. 
The Commission also finds that the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the provisions of Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of 
the Exchange Act.
75
Section 
15B(b)(2)(C) of the Exchange Act 
requires that MSRB rules not be 
designed to impose any burden on 
competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Exchange Act.
76
The 
Commission finds that the proposed 
rule change would not impose any 
burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Exchange Act because 
the proposed Rate Card Fees are 
applicable to all dealers and municipal advisors over the course of the four 
years covered by the proposed Multi- 
Year Rate Card, and the MSRB’s 
projected fee proportions would 
maintain balance between Municipal 
Advisor Professional Fees and Dealer 
Market Activity Fees, as well as among 
the three dealer fees that make up the 
Market Activity Fees.
77
Additionally, 
the proposed increases under the Rate 
Card Fees will be proportionately 
distributed across regulated entities.
78
 
The Commission further finds that the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the provisions of Section 
15B(b)(2)(L)(iv) of the Exchange Act.
79
 
Section 15B(b)(2)(L)(iv) of the Exchange 
Act
80
requires that MSRB rules not 
impose a regulatory burden on small 
municipal advisors that is not necessary 
or appropriate in the public interest and 
for the protection of investors, 
municipal entities, and obligated 
persons, provided that there is robust 
protection of investors against fraud. 
The Commission finds that the 
proposed Municipal Advisor 
Professional Fee would not impose an 
unnecessary or inappropriate regulatory 
burden on small municipal advisors 
since the total amount of the assessment 
payable by each municipal advisory 
firm would continue to be proportional 
to the number of Form MA-Is filed by 
a firm and, therefore, would result in 
lower relative assessments for smaller 
firms.
81
Based on the number of persons 
engaging in municipal advisory 
activities on behalf of a firm, the total 
fee would therefore bear a reasonable 
relationship to the level of regulated

The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Terms of Substance of the Proposed 
Rule Change 
The proposed rule change consists of 
amendments to FICC’s Government 
Securities Division (‘‘GSD’’) Rulebook 
(‘‘Rules’’)
5
to (1) update the definition 
of ‘‘Overnight Investment Rate’’ to 
reflect that such rate is applicable to 
cash held by FICC in connection with 
funds-only settlement; (2) change the 
frequency of GCF Interest Adjustment 
Payments and Interest Adjustment 
Payments to monthly, rather than daily, 
in certain circumstances; and (3) remove 
an outdated reference from a statement 
in Rule 13. 
II. Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the 
Proposed Rule Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
clearing agency included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
clearing agency has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, 
and C below, of the most significant 
aspects of such statements. 
(A) Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the 
Proposed Rule Change 
1. Purpose 
FICC is proposing changes to the 
Rules that would update a definition 
and certain provisions related to the 
components of GSD’s funds-only 
settlement, or ‘‘FOS.’’ Specifically, the 
proposed changes would update and 
clarify the definition of Overnight 
Investment Rate, which is the interest 
rate used in the calculation of two 
components of FOS, the GCF Interest 
Adjustment Payment and the Interest 
Adjustment Payment. The proposed 
changes would also update the 
frequency of GCF Interest Adjustment 
Payments and Interest Adjustment 
Payments to monthly, rather than daily, 
in certain circumstances. Finally, the 
proposed changes would remove an 
outdated reference from a statement in 
Rule 13, which was retained in the 
Rules in error. These proposed changes 
would update, clarify and correct the 
Rules related to FOS, providing Netting 
Members with a clearer understanding 
of these provisions and their rights 
thereunder. 
Overview of Funds-Only Settlement 
FOS is a twice-daily process of 
generating a net credit or debit cash 
amount for each Netting Member and 
settling those cash amounts between 
Netting Members and FICC. FOS is 
described in Rule 13 and is a cash pass- 
through process, meaning Netting 
Members who are in a debit position 
submit payments that are then used to 
pay Netting Members in a credit 
position.
6
 
Twice each Business Day, each 
Netting Member must pay (or is entitled 
to collect) an aggregate Funds-Only 
Settlement Amount across all CUSIPs in 
which it has outstanding positions. The 
main components of this amount 
include, among other payments, a mark- 
to-market amount for every Net 
Settlement Position, a mark-to-market 
amount for every Forward Net 
Settlement Position, fail marks for 
obligations that were scheduled to settle 
and have not yet settled, coupon 
payments and other adjustments.
7
 
The settlement ultimately occurs 
through the National Settlement Service 
(‘‘NSS’’), a payment system operated by 
the Federal Reserve System (‘‘FRS’’).
8
 
Cash debits and credits are paid out by 
Funds-Only Settling Bank Members, 
who are appointed by Netting Members. 
The individual debits and credits of 
each Netting Member using the same 
Funds-Only Settling Bank Member are 
totaled. Once the net debits and credits 
are approved by Funds-Only Settling 
Bank Members, the New York Federal 
Reserve Bank debits or credits each 
Funds-Only Settling Bank Member. 
Funds-Only Settling Bank Members 
then debit or credit the account of each 
Netting Member for which it settles. 
Funds transfers become final at the time 
the funds are moved through NSS. 
Proposed Changes to the Definition of 
Overnight Investment Rate 
The Rules define Overnight 
Investment Rate as the interest rate 
earned by FICC on the investment of the 
portion of the cash deposited to its 
Clearing Fund that is invested 
overnight. However, this term is 
currently only used in the definitions of 
two components of FOS—the GCF 
Interest Adjustment Payment and the 
Interest Adjustment Payment—and is 
not used in reference to FICC’s deposits

See Rule 1 (Definitions) (defined terms for ‘‘GCF Interest Adjustment Payment’’ and ‘‘Interest

Therefore, FICC is proposing to 
correct and clarify the definition of 
Overnight Investment Rate to mean the 
interest rate earned by FICC on the 
investment of cash held by FICC in 
connection with certain FOS debits that 
are invested overnight. The proposed 
change would correct the definition of 
this term, making the Rules clearer in 
describing the related components of 
FOS. 
Proposed Changes to Frequency of 
Certain FOS Component Processing 
The components of FOS credit and 
debit payments are described in Section 
1 of Rule 13, and Netting Members are 
required to make such credit and debit 
payments ‘‘one or more times each 
Business Day’’.
10
As stated above, in 
practice, FOS credit and debits are 
currently processed twice each Business 
Day. 
Because FOS is a pass-through 
process, if FICC debits a Netting 
Member for one component of FOS but 
does not have an equivalent credit to 
pay to another Netting Member, then 
FICC must hold and invest the cash 
amount it has debited overnight, until it 
can pay that amount to a Netting 
Member the next Business Day. This 
may occur in connection with the credit 
and debit payments of the Debit 
Forward Mark Adjustment Payments 
and the corresponding Credit Forward 
Mark Adjustment Payment, or with the 
Debit GCF Forward Mark Adjustment 
Payments and the corresponding Credit 
GCF Forward Mark Adjustment 
Payment.
11
 
The interest rate that FICC earns on 
such investments is the Overnight 
Investment Rate. The Interest 
Adjustment Payment and GCF Interest 
Adjustment Payment are components of 
FOS related to the overnight interest 
earned on such investments and, as 
noted above, may be assessed by FICC 
on the Debit Forward Mark Adjustment 
Payment, Credit Forward Mark 
Adjustment Payment, Debit GCF 
Forward Mark Adjustment Payment, 
and Credit GCF Forward Mark 
Adjustment Payment amounts. 
Historically, FICC has deposited 
amounts related to these FOS 
components at commercial banks that 
have paid interest on a daily basis, 
allowing FICC to pay its portion of the 
GCF Interest Adjustment Payment and 
the Interest Adjustment Payment 
components of FOS on a daily basis, 
within the timeframes specified in Rule 
13. 
However, fewer investment 
counterparties pay interest on deposits 
on a daily basis, and those that do offer 
daily interest payments do so at an 
interest rate that is not aligned with 
prevailing market rates. 
In order for FICC to earn an interest 
rate on its investments related to FOS 
debits that is more aligned with the 
market, FICC would begin depositing 
these amounts with investment 
counterparties that do not pay interest 
on a daily basis. Therefore, FICC is 
proposing to amend Rule 13 to reflect a 
less frequent payment of the accrued 
GCF Interest Adjustment Payment and 
Interest Adjustment Payment 
components of FOS, to a monthly basis. 
In order to reflect this change, FICC 
would amend Section 1 of Rule 13 to 
describe the circumstances in which it 
would pay the Credit Interest 
Adjustment Payment and the GCF 
Interest Adjustment Payment 
components of FOS on a less frequent 
basis than other components of FOS. 
Specifically, FICC would add a 
subsection (i) to Section 1(d) of Rule 13 
to provide that, when a Debit Forward 
Mark Adjustment Payment is collected, 
for which FICC does not have an 
equivalent Credit Forward Mark 
Adjustment Payment to pay to another 
Netting Member, the related Credit 
Interest Adjustment Payment would be 
paid on a monthly basis. FICC would 
also add a subsection (i) to Section 1(l) 
of Rule 13 to similarly provide that, 
when a Debit GCF Forward Mark 
Adjustment Payment is collected, for 
which FICC does not have an equivalent 
Credit GCF Forward Mark Adjustment 
Payment to pay to another Netting 
Member, the related Credit GCF Interest 
Adjustment Payment would be paid on 
a monthly basis. 
Proposed Changes To Remove Outdated 
Reference From Rule 13 
FICC is proposing to delete a 
reference to Section 3 of Rule 13 from 
a statement in Section 1 of Rule 13 
because Section 3 of Rule 13 was 
removed from the Rules in a prior 
proposed rule change. This reference to 
Section 3 was retained in the Rule in 
error. 
The relevant statement currently 
provides that, other than as provided for 
in Section 3, all payment obligations 
and collection rights with respect to the 
FOS components must be satisfied each 
Business Day on a net total basis 
through payment or collection, as set 
forth in Section 2 of Rule 13, of the 
Funds-Only Settlement Amount. The 
proposed rule change would correct this 
statement by replacing the reference to 
Section 3 of Rule 13 in this statement 
with a more general reference to ‘‘this 
Rule’’. 
Implementation Timeframe 
FICC would implement the proposed 
rule change by no later than February 
28, 2026 and would announce the 
implementation date of the proposed 
changes by an Important Notice posted 
to FICC’s website. 
2. Statutory Basis 
FICC believes the proposed rule 
changes are consistent with the 
requirements of the Act and the rules 
and regulations thereunder applicable to 
a registered clearing agency. In 
particular, FICC believes the proposed 
rule changes are consistent with Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act
12
and Rule 
17ad–22(e)(23)(ii), promulgated under 
the Act,
13
for the reasons described 
below. 
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act 
requires, in part, that the rules of a 
clearing agency be designed to promote 
the prompt and accurate clearance and 
settlement of securities transactions and 
assure the safeguarding of securities and 
funds which are in the custody or 
control of the clearing agency or for 
which it is responsible.
14
The proposed 
changes would describe a change in the 
timing of the Credit Interest Adjustment 
Payment and the Credit GCF Interest 
Adjustment Payment, and the 
circumstances in which that less 
frequent timing would be applicable, as 
described in more detail above. This 
proposed change is driven by a change 
in practice by FICC that would provide 
Netting Members with an interest rate 
on deposits of cash related to FOS 
payments and debits that is more 
aligned with prevailing market rates. In 
this way, the proposed rule change 
would assure the safeguarding of funds 
which are in the custody or control of 
FICC, consistent with Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.
15
 
The proposed rule changes would 
also update the defined term for

Overnight Investment Rate in the Rules 
and would remove a reference in Rule 
13 that was retained in error. These two 
proposed changes would correct the 
Rules, ensuring they are clear and easily 
understood by Netting Members. When 
participants better understand their 
rights and obligations regarding the 
Rules, such participants are more likely 
to act in accordance with the Rules, 
which FICC believes would promote the 
prompt and accurate clearance and 
settlement of securities transactions. 
Therefore, FICC believes that the 
proposed changes are consistent with 
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.
16
 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(23)(ii) under the Act 
requires that FICC establish, implement, 
maintain and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to 
provide sufficient information to enable 
participants to identify and evaluate the 
risks, fees, and other material costs they 
incur by participating in the covered 
clearing agency.
17
As stated above, the 
proposed rule changes would correct 
the Rules by updating the definition of 
Overnight Investment Rate and 
removing an incorrect reference in 
Section 1 of Rule 13. As such, these 
proposed changes would further 
improve the public disclosures in the 
Rules regarding FOS and the timing of 
certain payments related to the FOS 
process. Therefore, FICC believes that 
the proposed changes are consistent 
with Rule 17ad–22(e)(23)(ii) under the 
Act.
18
 
(B) Clearing Agency’s Statement on 
Burden on Competition 
FICC does not believe the proposed 
rule changes would have any impact on 
competition. First, the proposed 
changes regarding the timing of certain 
FOS payments would apply equally to 
all Netting Members. Further, the 
proposed changes to the definition of 
Overnight Investment Rate and the 
correction to Rule 13 are designed to 
improve market participants’ 
understanding of the provisions in the 
Rules governing FOS. As such, FICC 
does not believe such proposed 
amendments would have any effect on 
participants’ respective competitive 
positions. 
(C) Clearing Agency’s Statement on 
Comments on the Proposed Rule 
Change Received From Members, 
Participants, or Others 
FICC has not received or solicited any 
written comments relating to this 
proposal. If any written comments are 
received, they will be publicly filed as 
Exhibit 2 to this filing, as required by 
Form 19b–4 and the General 
Instructions thereto. 
Persons submitting comments are 
cautioned that, according to Section IV 
(Solicitation of Comments) of the 
Exhibit 1A in the General Instructions to 
Form 19b–4, the Commission does not 
edit personal identifying information 
from comment submissions. 
Commenters should submit only 
information that they wish to make 
available publicly, including their 
name, email address, and any other 
identifying information.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to provide 
Nasdaq with limited discretion to deny 
initial listing to companies, even where 
the applicant meets all stated listing 
requirements. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/nasdaq/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
Recently, Nasdaq has observed 
problematic or unusual trading in 
certain listed companies. Further, the 
Commission has imposed temporary 
trading suspensions pursuant to Section 
12(k) of the Act on several listed 
securities based, generally, on concerns 
about potential manipulation in the 
securities effectuated through 
recommendations made to investors by 
unknown persons via social media to 
purchase, hold, and/or sell the 
securities. The Commission stated its 
belief that these recommendations 
appear to be designed to artificially 
inflate the price and volume of the 
securities and that the public interest 
and the protection of investors require 
a suspension of trading in the 
securities.
3
In most cases, the affected 
securities were listed for less than one 
year. 
The Commission Suspension Orders 
generally appear to be based on 
activities of third parties, and there are 
no specific allegations in the 
Commission Suspension Orders against 
the companies, or persons associated 
with the companies, as being involved 
in the potentially manipulative trading 
activity. Nasdaq’s listing requirements, 
which these companies satisfied both at 
the time of listing and on an ongoing 
basis, are based on the characteristics of 
the company itself and the securities it 
seeks to list. Likewise, Nasdaq Rule 
5101, in conjunction with IM–5101–1, 
provides some discretion to deny listing 
where the company itself has engaged in 
misconduct or where an individual with 
a history of regulatory misconduct is 
associated with the company.
4
Nasdaq 
Rule 5101 does not allow denial of a 
listing based on the potential for one or 
more unaffiliated third parties to engage 
in misconduct impacting a company’s 
securities.
5
The Commission is obliged 
to set aside a decision to deny listing 
that does not comport with Nasdaq 
rules.
6
Therefore, Nasdaq requires 
additional authority to exercise 
discretion to deny a listing based on the 
potential for one or more third parties 
to engage in misconduct impacting a 
company’s securities. Similarly, Nasdaq 
rules do not presently allow it to deny 
listing to a company based on its review 
of trading patterns of other companies 
with similar characteristics or based on 
considerations related to the company’s 
advisors, and it requires additional 
authority to exercise discretion to do 
so.
7
 
Nasdaq is concerned about the 
allegedly manipulative trading taking 
place in listed securities and that 
pending applicants, despite meeting all 
listing requirements, have 
characteristics similar to those subject to 
the Commission’s trading suspensions 
and therefore may be susceptible to 
similar manipulation. While Nasdaq 
proposed certain changes to the listing 
requirements in September 2025,
8
those 
changes remain pending
9
and Nasdaq 
believes that additional rules would 
help to address the concerns identified 
in the Commission Suspension Orders. 
For example, Nasdaq may identify 
similarities between companies seeking 
initial listing and the advisors to the 
companies that are the subject of the 
Commission Suspension Orders 
(including auditors, underwriters, law 
firms, brokers, clearing firms, or other 
professional service providers). For 
another example, Nasdaq may consider 
the impact of foreign laws on the 
potential recourse available to U.S. 
regulators or investors in the event of 
misconduct. Accordingly, Nasdaq 
proposes to adopt a new rule, IM–5101– 
3, providing Nasdaq with authority 
under Rule 5101 to deny initial listing 
based on factors that could make the 
listed security susceptible to 
manipulation related to concerns 
Nasdaq and other regulators have 
identified with previously listed 
companies that are similarly situated to 
the company or based on considerations 
related to the company’s advisors 
(including auditors, underwriters, law 
firms, brokers, clearing firms, or other 
professional service providers), even 
where the applicant meets all stated 
listing requirements. 
The proposed rule change includes a 
series of non-exclusive factors that 
Nasdaq will consider in determining 
whether to apply this discretion. These 
factors include the following: 
€where the company is located, including the availability of legal 
remedies to U.S. shareholders in that 
jurisdiction, the existence of blocking

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60831 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices 10
Nasdaq believes it is important to consider the 
location of a person or entity that exercises 
substantial influence over the company to ensure 
that such individuals and entities are accountable 
to shareholders and regulators, as appropriate.

present challenges to regulators seeking

jurisdiction, and the transparency of

or entity is located, including the 
availability of legal remedies to U.S. 
shareholders in that jurisdiction, the

jurisdictions that may present 
challenges to regulators seeking to 
enforce rules against the person or 
entity, the ability of parties to conduct 
comprehensive due diligence in that 
jurisdiction, and the transparency of 
regulators in the jurisdiction; 
€whether the expected public float and dissemination of the share 
distribution, based on a review of 
underwriter, broker and clearing 
allocations and consideration of prior 
deals involving those service providers, 
at the time of the IPO and post offering, 
raises concerns about adequate liquidity 
and potential concentration; 
€whether there are issues concerning the company’s advisors (including 
auditors, underwriters, law firms, 
brokers, clearing firms, or other 
professional service providers), based 
on factors including, but not limited to, 
whether the advisor has been reviewed 
by applicable regulators and, if so, what 
were the results of those reviews; 
Æif the company’s advisor is a new entity, whether the advisor’s principals 
were involved with other firms with a 
regulatory history; 
€whether any of the company’s advisors were involved in prior 
transactions where the securities 
became subject to a pattern of 
concerning or volatile trading; 
€whether the company’s management and Board has experience 
or familiarity with U.S. public company 
requirements, including regulatory and 
reporting requirements under Nasdaq 
rules and federal securities laws; 
€whether there are any FINRA, SEC or other regulatory referrals related to 
the company or its advisors, which can 
be included in the record of the matter 
and, if applicable, the results of those 
referrals; 
€whether the company currently has, or recently has had, a going concern 
audit opinion and, if so, what is the 
Company’s plan to continue as a going 
concern; and 
€whether there are other factors that raise concerns about the integrity of the 
Company’s board, management, 
significant shareholders, or advisors. 
By giving Nasdaq the authority to 
exercise discretion in this manner, 
Nasdaq believes it can better address 
situations where a company satisfies 
Nasdaq’s listing requirements, but has 
characteristics similar to other 
companies’ securities where trading 
problems were observed and could 
make the company susceptible to 
manipulation. While Nasdaq may not 
otherwise have access to the facts 
underlying problematic or unusual 
trading that takes place across multiple 
U.S. exchanges as well as off-exchange, 
the factors will help identify situations 
where similar characteristics exist that 
are likely to create conditions that could 
allow problematic or unusual trading to 
also occur in the applicant’s securities. 
Moreover, the proposed rule change will 
also give Nasdaq the authority to 
consider the involvement of advisors to 
the company and gatekeepers in other 
transactions that had problematic or 
unusual trading, and to take action to 
deny initial listing to a company 
involved with these entities. 
When Nasdaq uses its authority to 
exercise discretion to deny listing, 
Nasdaq Staff will issue a written 
determination describing the basis for 
its decision. A Company must, within 
four business days from the date of 
Staff’s written determination, make a 
public announcement in a press release 
or other Regulation FD compliant 
manner about the receipt of the 
determination and the Rule(s) upon 
which the determination is based, 
describing each specific basis and 
concern identified by Nasdaq in 
reaching its determination.
11
The 
Company may within seven calendar 
days of when its application is denied 
seek review by a Hearings Panel, as set 
forth in Rule 5815. 
This proposed rule change is 
immediately effective, and Nasdaq 
proposes to apply the proposed rule to 
all companies currently in the 
application process. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
12
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
13
 
in particular, in that it is designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative 
acts and practices, to promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, to remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in 
general to protect investors and the 
public interest. Further, the Exchange 
believes that this proposal is not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Commission has previously 
opined on the importance of meaningful 
listing standards for the protection of 
investors and the public interest.
14
In 
particular, the Commission has stated: 
The development and enforcement of 
meaningful listing standards for an 
exchange is of critical importance to 
financial markets and the investing 
public. Among other things, such listing 
standards help ensure that exchange- 
listed companies will have sufficient 
public float, investor base, and trading 
interest to provide the depth and 
liquidity to promote fair and orderly 
markets.
15
 
Nasdaq believes that granting limited 
additional discretion to deny initial 
listing to companies, even when an 
applicant meets all stated listing 
requirements, is consistent with the 
requirements in Section 6(b)(5) of the 
Exchange Act. As noted, Nasdaq has 
observed trading patterns in certain 
securities—such as price swings 
unrelated to company news—and the 
Commission has issued multiple 
suspension orders alleging market 
manipulation in similar circumstances. 
The proposed factors will help provide 
transparency to situations where Nasdaq 
believes an applicant’s securities may be 
more susceptible to manipulation, based 
on comparable characteristics or the 
involvement of similar advisors. 
Accordingly, Nasdaq believes that 
adopting this additional authority is 
consistent with the requirements to 
protect investors and the public interest. 
Further, while Nasdaq’s use of this 
discretion may prevent some companies 
that otherwise meet the stated listing 
requirements from listing, such 
distinction between companies is not 
unfair because the affected companies 
will exhibit traits that increase their 
susceptibility to manipulation or share 
advisors with companies that previously 
demonstrated problematic or unusual 
trading patterns. Therefore the proposed

17
17 CFR 240.19b–4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6) requires a self-regulatory organization to give 
the Commission written notice of its intent to file 
the proposed rule change, along with a brief 
description and text of the proposed rule change, 
at least five business days prior to the date of filing 
of the proposed rule change, or such shorter time 
as designated by the Commission. The Exchange 
has satisfied this requirement.

19
17 CFR 240.19b–4(f)(6)(iii). 
20
For purposes only of waiving the 30-day 
operative delay, the Commission has also 
considered the proposed rule’s impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 
15 U.S.C. 78c(f).

rule change is consistent with Section 
6(b)(5). 
Nasdaq also believes that any impact 
on competition among companies as a 
result of the proposed rule change is 
necessary in furtherance of the investor 
protection goals of the Act. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
proposed rule change will not impose 
any burden on competition among 
exchanges, since other exchanges either 
already have, or are able to adopt, 
similar rules providing them with 
discretion to deny initial listing. The 
proposed rule change may impose a 
burden on companies that are denied 
listing, but this burden is necessary to 
protect investors and the public interest, 
which is a primary purpose of the Act. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: (i) significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant 
burden on competition; and (iii) become 
operative for 30 days from the date on 
which it was filed, or such shorter time 
as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
16
and Rule 
19b–4(f)(6)
17
thereunder. 
A proposed rule change filed under 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
18
normally does not 
become operative prior to 30 days after 
the date of filing. However, pursuant to 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii),
19
the Commission 
may designate a shorter time if such 
action is consistent with the protection 
of investors and the public interest. The 
Exchange asked that the Commission 
waive the 30-day operative delay so that 
the proposal may become operative 
immediately upon filing. The Exchange 
states that waiver of the 30-day 
operative delay will immediately 
provide the Exchange with additional 
authority to exercise discretion to deny 
initial listing based on factors that could 
make the listed security susceptible to 
manipulation. The Exchange further 
states that applying this authority to any 
companies that may otherwise seek to 
list during the 30-day period could 
potentially minimize subsequent 
manipulative trading in those 
companies’ securities. For these reasons, 
the Commission believes that waiver of 
the 30-day operative delay is consistent 
with the protection of investors and the 
public interest. Accordingly, the 
Commission hereby waives the 30-day 
operative delay and designates the 
proposal operative upon filing.
20
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

As defined in Rule 11.8(e)(1)(E), the term 
‘‘Minimum Performance Standards’’ means a set of 
standards applicable to an LMM that may be 
determined from time to time by the Exchange. 
Such standards will vary between LMM Securities 
depending on the price, liquidity, and volatility of 
the LMM Security in which the LMM is registered. 
The performance measurements will include: (A) 
percent of time at the NBBO; (B) percent of 
executions better than the NBBO; (C) average 
displayed size; and (D) average quoted spread. 
4
The ETP LMM Program was adopted in 2019 
and was designed to encourage LMMs to maintain 
better market quality in BZX-listed securities, and, 
in particular, in lower volume securities where 
transaction-based compensation (i.e., rebates) may not be sufficient. See Securities Exchange Act No. 91151 (February 10, 2021) 86 FR 11372 (February 
24, 2021) (SR–CboeBZX–2021–016) (the ‘‘Original 
Filing’’). 
5
The Exchange initially filed the proposed fee 
changes on November 21, 2025 (SR–CboeBZX– 
2025–150), withdrew that filing on December 4, 
2025, and submitted a replacement filing (SR– 
CboeBZX–2025–160). The Exchange withdrew SR– 
CboeBZX–2025–160 on December 12, 2025, and 
submitted this filing. 
6
Minimum Performance Standards generally 
refers to a set of standards applicable to an LMM 
that may be determined from time to time by the 
Exchange. See e.g., Exchange Rule 11.8(e)(1)(E). 7
The term ‘‘LMM Security’’ means BZX-listed 
securities for which a Member is an LMM. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (‘‘BZX’’ or 
the ‘‘Exchange’’) is filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’ or ‘‘SEC’’) a proposed 
rule change to modify the Minimum 
Performance Standards applicable to the 
Exchange’s Lead Market Maker 
(‘‘LMM’’) program in BZX-listed 
exchange-traded product (‘‘ETP’’) 
securities as provided in footnote 14 of 
the Exchange’s fee schedule and to 
remove Closed-End Funds (‘‘CEFs’’) 
from the ETP LMM program. The text of 
the proposed rule change is provided in 
Exhibit 5. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is also available on the Commission’s 
website (https://www.sec.gov/rules/ 
sro.shtml), the Exchange’s website 
(https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/ 
regulation/rule_filings/bzx/), and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
Fee Schedule applicable to its equities 
trading platform (‘‘BZX Equities’’) to (1) 
modify the Minimum Performance 
Standards
3
applicable to the ETP LMM 
program
4
by changing the criteria 
needed to earn the Base Rates and 
Enhanced Rates provided in footnote 
14(B) of the fee schedule; (2) 
memorialize those Minimum 
Performance Standards in the fee 
schedule; and (3) remove CEFs from the 
ETP LMM Program. The Exchange 
proposes to implement these changes 
effective December 1, 2025.
5
 
The Exchange first notes that its 
listings business operates in a highly- 
competitive market in which market 
participants, which includes issuers of 
securities, LMMs, and other liquidity 
providers, can readily transfer their 
listings, opt not to participate, or direct 
order flow to competing venues if they 
deem fee levels, liquidity provision 
incentive programs, or any other factor 
at a particular venue to be insufficient 
or excessive. The proposed rule changes 
reflect a competitive pricing structure 
designed to incentivize market 
participants to participate as LMMs in 
the Exchange’s LMM Program, which 
the Exchange believes will enhance 
market quality in all securities listed on 
the Exchange and encourage issuers to 
list new products and transfer existing 
products to the Exchange. 
The Exchange currently offers daily 
incentives for LMMs in ETPs and CEFs 
and listed on the Exchange for which 
the LMM meets certain ‘‘Base’’ or 
‘‘Enhanced’’ Minimum Performance 
Standards.
6
Such daily incentives are 
determined based on the number of 
BZX-listed ETPs/CEFs for which the 
LMM meets such Minimum 
Performance Standards and the average 
auction volume across such securities. 
Generally speaking, the more LMM 
Securities
7
for which the LMM meets 
the Minimum Performance Standards 
and the higher the auction volume 
across those ETPs/CEFs, the greater the 
total daily incentive to the LMM. 
The Exchange first proposes to 
eliminate CEFs from the ETP LMM 
Program provided under footnote 14(B) 
of the fee schedule. To effect this 
change, the Exchange proposes to 
remove CEFs from the definition of 
‘‘Qualified ETP LMM’’ and adopt a new 
term ‘‘Qualified CEF LMM’’ in the fee 
schedule. The Exchange proposes to 
define ‘‘Qualified CEF LMM’’ to mean 
an LMM in a BZX-listed CEF security 
that meets the LMM performance 
standards set forth in Rule 
11.8(e)(1)(E)(ii). The Exchange proposes 
to modify the existing definition of 
‘‘Qualified ETP LMM’’ to mean an LMM 
in a BZX-listed ETP that is registered as 
a market maker in good standing on the 
Exchange that meets the Base or 
Enhanced Minimum Performance 
Standards set forth in footnote 14(B). 
The Exchange also proposes to 
eliminate all references to CEFs in 
footnote 14(B) of the fee schedule. The 
Exchange proposes to adopt a new 
definition for the term ‘‘ETP Minimum 
Performance Standards’’ which would 
mean the ‘‘Base’’ or ‘‘Enhanced’’ 
standards set forth in footnote 14(B) of 
the fee schedule. The Exchange also 
proposes to modify references to 
Standard Rates in footnote 14(B) to Base 
Rates. 
The Exchange also proposes to amend 
both the Base and Enhanced Minimum 
Performance Standards under which an 
ETP LMM would qualify for the daily 
incentive. The Exchange proposes no 
changes to the amount of the daily 
incentives currently provided in the fee 
schedule. 
The Original Filing provided that the 
Exchange expects the Minimum 
Performance Standards to include the 
below, and before diverging 
significantly from those ranges, the 
Exchange would submit a rule filing to 
the Commission describing such 
proposed changes. Specifically, the 
Minimum Performance Standards 
included in Original Filing required: 
(i) registration as a market maker in 
good standing with the Exchange; 
(ii) time at the inside requirements 
(generally between 3% and 15% of 
Regular Trading Hours for Base 
Minimum Performance Standards and 
between 5% to 50% for Enhanced 
Minimum Performance Standards, 
depending on the average daily volume 
of the applicable LMM Security); 
(iii) auction participation 
requirements (generally requiring that 
the auction price is between 3% and 5% 
of the last Reference Price, as defined in 
Rule 11.23(a)(19), for Base Minimum 
Performance Standards and 1%–3% for 
Enhanced Minimum Performance 
Standards); 
(iv) market-wide NBB and NBO 
spread and size requirements (generally 
requiring between 200 and 750 shares at 
both the NBB and NBO for both Base 
and Enhanced Minimum Performance 
Standards with an NBBO spread 
between 1% and 10% for Base

The Exchange proposes six asset class categories 
as follows: (1) US Equity, (2) Single Stock, (3) 
Outcome Based, (4) Fixed Income, (5) International 
Equity, and (6) Other. 
9
See Exchange Rule 1.5(w). 10
The Exchange calculates time at the NBBO by 
separately determining the percentage of time the 
LMM is at the NBB and at the NBO, then averaging 
those two percentages. 
11
To calculate the time that the LMM meets the 
depth of book requirement, the Exchange considers 
the time during which the LMM has both bid(s) and 
offer(s) (i.e., a two-sided quote) posted to the Exchange that satisfy the notional value and price 
requirements. 
Minimum Performance Standards and 
.25% to 4% for Enhanced Minimum 
Performance Standards, depending on 
price of the ETP and underlying asset 
class); and 
(v) depth of book requirements 
(generally requiring between $25,000 
and $250,000 of displayed posted 
liquidity for both Base and Enhanced 
Minimum Performance Standards 
within 1% to 10% of both the NBB and 
NBO for Base Minimum Performance 
Standards and 0.25% and 5% for 
Enhanced Minimum Performance 
Standards, depending on price of the 
ETP and underlying asset class). 
Now, the Exchange proposes to 
modify the Base and Enhanced 
Minimum Performance Standards and 
memorialize those Minimum 
Performance Standards in the fee 
schedule. 
First, the Exchange proposes to 
provide under footnote 14(B) 
introductory language related to a 
Qualified ETP LMM. Specifically, the 
Exchange proposes to provide that 
Qualified ETP LMMs that meet the Base 
or Enhanced Minimum Performance 
Standards below are entitled to the 
Qualified ETP LMM daily incentive. 
Each assigned ETP is grouped based on 
an asset class categorization.
8
An ETP 
LMM is considered to have met the Base 
and Enhanced Minimum Performance 
Standard for an assigned ETP for the 
trading day if it meets each of the 
following Base or Enhanced 
requirements: 
(1) Time with Two-Sided Quotation: ETP LMM must maintain both bid(s) 
and offer(s) at least a certain percentage 
of the time the security is in a trading 
state during Regular Trading Hours 
(‘‘RTH’’).
9
Specifically, across all six 
asset class categories and for Base and 
Enhanced Minimum Performance 
Standards, the ETP LMM must maintain 
both bid(s) and off(s) at least 98% of the 
time the security is in a trading state 
during RTH, as follows: 
US equity 
(%) 
Single stock

Base .............................................98 98 98 98 98 98 Enhanced .....................................98 98 98 98 98 98 (2) Time at the National Best Bid and Offer (‘‘NBBO’’): ETP LMM must maintain both bid(s) and offer(s) at the 
NBBO at least a certain percentage of 
the time the security is in a trading state 
during RTH, as summarized in the table 
below.
10
The Base and Enhanced 
Minimum Performance Standard is 
applied based on consolidated average 
daily volume (‘‘CADV’’) of the ETP 
LMM Security.

must maintain bid(s) and offer(s) at the 
NBB or NBO, respectively, at least 5% 
of the time the security is in a trading 
state during RTH for ETP LMM 
Securities with a CADV equal than or 
greater than 500,000 shares across all six 
asset categories to meet the Base 
Minimum Performance Standard. For 
ETP LMM Securities with a CADV less 
than 500,000 shares, the ETP LMM must 
maintain bid(s) and offer(s) at the NBB 
or NBO, respectively, at least 20% of the 
time the security is in a trading state 
during RTH for ETP LMM Securities 
with a CADV equal than or greater than 
500,000 shares across all six asset 
categories to meet the Base Minimum 
Performance Standard. 
The Enhanced Minimum Performance 
Standard requires the ETP LMM must 
maintain bid(s) and offer(s) at the NBB 
or NBO, respectively, at least 15% of the 
time the security is in a trading state 
during RTH for ETP LMM Securities 
with a CADV equal than or greater than 
500,000 shares across all six asset 
categories. For ETP LMM Securities 
with a CADV less than 500,000 shares, 
the ETP LMM must maintain bid(s) and 
offer(s) at the NBB or NBO, respectively, 
at least 60% of the time the security is 
in a trading state during RTH for ETP 
LMM Securities with a CADV less than 
500,000 shares across all six asset 
categories. 
(3) Depth of Book: ETP LMM must maintain a minimum notional value of 
both bid(s) and offer(s) within a certain 
percentage of the NBBO for at least 
90%

ETP LMM must maintain a notional 
value of $150,000 on both the bid and 
the offer within at least 1–2% 
(dependent on the asset category) of the 
NBB and NBO, respectively, across the 
six asset categories. The Enhanced 
Minimum Performance Standard 
requires the LMM maintain a notional 
value ranging from $150,000 to 
$175,000 on both the bid and offer 
within at least 0.25–0.50% of the NBB 
and NBO, respectively, across the six 
asset categories. 
(4) Minimum Size at NBBO: market- wide NBBO must have a minimum 
number of shares available at both the 
NBB and NBO at least 50% during the 
time the security is in a trading state 
during RTH, as follows:

requires 300 to 500 shares available at 
the NBB and NBO across all market 
centers for at least 50% of the trading 
day based on the asset categorization of 
the LMM ETP Security. The Enhanced 
Minimum Performance Standard 
requires 1,000 to 1,300 shares available 
at the NBB and NBO across all market 
centers for at least 50% of the trading 
day based on the asset categorization of 
the LMM ETP Security. 
(5) Maximum NBBO Spread: market- wide NBBO spread must be within a 
certain percentage for at least 95%

Minimum Performance Standard 
requires the NBBO spread across all 
market centers be within 0.50–1% for at 
least 95% of the trading day based on 
the asset categorization of the LMM ETP 
Security. The Enhanced Minimum

consistent with the requirements of the 
Act for the reasons discussed below. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the Act 
and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
16
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5)
17
requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged 
in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, 
and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
18
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers as 
well as Section 6(b)(4)
19
as it is 
designed to provide for the equitable 
allocation of reasonable dues, fees and 
other charges among its Members and 
other persons using its facilities. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed changes to the ETP LMM 
Program are consistent with Section 
6(b)(5) of the Act because they are 
designed to enhance market quality and 
liquidity in Exchange-listed securities. 
Specifically, the proposed rule change 
memorializes the Minimum 
Performance Standards applicable to 
ETP LMMs in the fee schedule, 
providing greater transparency and 
clarity to market participants regarding 
the obligations and expectations for 
LMMs participating in the program. The 
Exchange notes that it is appropriate to 
memorialize the ETP Minimum 
Performance Standards in the Fee 
Schedule rather than the rule book, as 
this approach is consistent with NYSE 
Arca’s treatment of similar standards.
20
 
This transparency removes 
impediments to and perfects the 
mechanism of a free and open market by 
ensuring that all market participants 
have clear notice of the standards that 
must be met to qualify for LMM 
incentives. 
The Exchange believes that 
segmenting the Minimum Performance 
Standards into asset classes is consistent 
with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act and is in 
line with how the Exchange 
understands market makers to take on 
and quote ETP assignments. Different 
asset classes—including US Equity, 
Single Stock, Outcome Based, Fixed 
Income, International Equity, and 
Other—have distinct trading 
characteristics, liquidity profiles, and 
market dynamics that affect how market 
makers can effectively provide liquidity. 
By tailoring the performance standards 
to reflect these differences, the 
Exchange believes that aligning asset 
classes with respective quoting 
obligations will result in more 
correlated market making support to the 
tickers that fall in each asset class. This 
approach promotes just and equitable 
principles of trade by establishing 
performance standards that are 
appropriately calibrated to the unique 
characteristics of each asset class, which 
in turn enhances liquidity provision and 
market quality for investors trading in 
these securities. 
The proposed asset class-based 
structure benefits investors and protects 
the public interest by ensuring that 
LMMs are held to standards that reflect 
the realities of providing liquidity in 
different types of ETPs. For example, 
Fixed Income ETPs may have different 
spread and depth characteristics than 
US Equity ETPs, and International 
Equity ETPs may face different pricing 
dynamics than Single Stock ETPs. By 
recognizing these differences in the 
Minimum Performance Standards, the 
Exchange creates incentives for LMMs 
to provide high-quality, consistent 
liquidity that is appropriate for each 
product type. This tailored approach 
removes impediments to and perfects 
the mechanism of a free and open 
market by encouraging market making 
activity that is well-suited to the 
specific needs of each asset class. 
The Exchange also believes that 
removing CEFs from the ETP LMM 
Program and establishing a separate 
‘‘Qualified CEF LMM’’ definition is 
consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the 
Act. This change recognizes the distinct 
trading characteristics and liquidity 
profiles of CEFs compared to ETPs and 
allows the Exchange to tailor its LMM 
programs appropriately to each product 
type. By applying the LMM performance 
standards set forth in Rule 
11.8(e)(1)(E)(ii) to CEFs, the Exchange 
ensures that CEF LMMs are subject to 
appropriate standards while focusing 
the proposed ETP LMM Program 
standards on ETPs, where such 
standards are better suited to the 
product characteristics. This tailored 
approach promotes just and equitable 
principles of trade and protects 
investors by ensuring that LMM 
obligations are appropriately calibrated 
to the securities for which they are 
responsible. 
Furthermore, the proposed rule 
change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) 
because it operates in a competitive 
environment where market participants 
can readily choose among competing 
venues. The Exchange’s LMM Program 
is designed to attract and retain LMMs 
by offering competitive incentives in 
exchange for meeting rigorous 
performance standards. This 
competitive structure ensures that the 
Exchange’s fees and incentive programs 
remain fair and reasonable, as LMMs 
and issuers can direct their business 
elsewhere if they find the Exchange’s 
terms to be insufficient or excessive. 
The proposed changes reflect the 
Exchange’s efforts to balance the need 
for high-quality market making with 
appropriate incentives, which 
ultimately benefits all market 
participants and promotes the public 
interest. 
Finally, the Exchange believes that 
memorializing the specific Minimum 
Performance Standards in the fee 
schedule, including the detailed 
requirements across different asset class 
categories and CADV thresholds, 
enhances transparency and removes 
impediments to a free and open market. 
Market participants will have clear, 
accessible information about the 
standards applicable to the ETP LMM 
Program, enabling them to make 
informed decisions about participation 
and allowing for more effective 
monitoring and compliance. This 
transparency is consistent with the Act’s 
objectives of promoting just and 
equitable principles of trade and 
protecting investors. 
For these reasons, the Exchange 
believes the proposed rule change is 
consistent with the requirements of 
Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The

Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change will enhance competition. 
The Exchange does not believe the 
proposed rule change will impose any 
burden on intramarket competition that 
is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
The proposed Minimum Performance 
Standards apply equally to all ETP 
LMMs that choose to participate in the 
ETP LMM Program. All ETP LMMs have 
the opportunity to qualify for the daily 
incentives by meeting either the Base or 
Enhanced Minimum Performance 
Standards, and the standards are 
transparent and objective. The Exchange 
notes that participation in the ETP LMM 
Program is voluntary, and market 
makers can choose whether to 
participate based on their assessment of 
whether they can meet the performance 
standards and whether the incentives 
are attractive relative to their costs. 
The proposed asset class-based 
structure does not impose a burden on 
intramarket competition because it 
reflects the different characteristics and 
trading dynamics of various ETP types. 
Market makers specializing in different 
asset classes face different operational 
requirements and market conditions, 
and the tailored standards recognize 
these differences rather than creating 
competitive advantages or 
disadvantages. An ETP LMM’s ability to 
meet the standards for any particular 
asset class depends on its operational 
capabilities and market making 
strategies, which are within the control 
of each market participant. 
Additionally, the removal of CEFs 
from the ETP LMM Program does not 
burden intramarket competition. CEF 
LMMs will continue to be subject to the 
LMM performance standards set forth in 
Rule 11.8(e)(1)(E)(ii), ensuring that all 
CEF LMMs are treated equally. The 
separation of CEFs from ETPs in the 
LMM Program structure simply 
recognizes the distinct nature of these 
products and allows the Exchange to 
apply appropriate standards to each 
product type. 
The Exchange does not believe the 
proposed rule change will impose any 
burden on intermarket competition that 
is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
The Exchange operates in a highly 
competitive market in which market 
participants can readily direct their 
business to competing venues if they 
deem fee levels, incentive programs, or 
other factors at a particular venue to be 
insufficient or excessive. The proposed 
changes to the ETP LMM Program are 
designed to attract and retain LMMs by 
offering competitive incentives in 
exchange for meeting performance 
standards that enhance market quality. 
To the extent the proposed rule 
change makes the Exchange’s LMM 
Program more attractive to market 
makers or issuers, any resulting 
competitive impact would be the result 
of the Exchange’s competitive pricing 
and program design, which is 
appropriate and consistent with the Act. 
Other exchanges are free to adopt 
similar or different LMM programs and 
incentive structures to compete for 
market maker participation and issuer 
listings. The Exchange believes that 
competition among venues for LMM 
participation and listings benefits 
investors by encouraging exchanges to 
develop programs that promote liquidity 
and market quality. 
Furthermore, the proposed rule 
change may enhance intermarket 
competition by encouraging other 
exchanges to evaluate and potentially 
improve their own LMM programs. This 
type of competitive dynamic promotes 
innovation and improvement in market 
structure, which ultimately benefits 
investors and the broader market 
ecosystem. 
The Exchange also notes that the 
proposed Minimum Performance 
Standards are designed to enhance 
liquidity in Exchange-listed ETPs, 
which benefits all market participants 
regardless of where they choose to trade. 
Improved liquidity and tighter spreads 
resulting from the enhanced LMM 
Program contribute to better price 
discovery and more efficient markets 
across all trading venues, as the benefits 
of improved market quality are not 
limited to the Exchange’s platform. 
For these reasons, the Exchange does 
not believe the proposed rule change 
will impose any burden on competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From

‘‘Specialized Quote Feed’’ or ‘‘SQF’’ is an 
interface that allows Market Makers to connect, 
send, and receive messages related to quotes, 
Immediate-or-Cancel Orders, and auction responses 
into and from the Exchange. Features include the 
following: (1) options symbol directory messages 
(e.g., underlying instruments); (2) system event messages (e.g., start of trading hours messages and start of opening); (3) trading action messages (e.g., halts and resumes); (4) execution messages; (5) 
quote messages; (6) Immediate-or-Cancel Order 
messages; (7) risk protection triggers and purge 
notifications; (8) opening imbalance messages; (9) 
auction notifications; and (10) auction responses. 
The SQF Purge Interface only receives and notifies 
of purge requests from the Market Maker. Market 
Makers may only enter interest into SQF in their 
assigned options series. Immediate-or-Cancel 
Orders entered into SQF are not subject to the Order 
Price Protection, Market Order Spread Protection, 
or Size Limitation Protection in Options 3, Section 
15(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(2) respectively. See Options 3, Section 7(e)(1)(B).

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Nasdaq

Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed 
Rule Change To Amend SQF Port and 
SQF Purge Port Fees 
December 19, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
16, 2025, Nasdaq BX, Inc. (‘‘BX’’ or 
‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’ or 
‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III, below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
Specialized Quote Feed
3
or ‘‘SQF’’ Port 
and SQF Purge Port pricing at Options 
7, Section 3, BX Options Market—Ports 
and other Services. The Exchange also 
proposes to remove outdated rule text at 
Options 7, Section 2, BX Options 
Market–Fees and Rebates.

While the changes proposed herein 
are effective upon filing, the Exchange 
has designated the amendments become 
operative on January 1, 2026. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/bx/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
BX proposes to amend its SQF Port 
and SQF Purge Port pricing at Options 
7, Section 3, BX Options Market—Ports 
and other Services by offering an 
incentive to Market Makers
5
to lower 
their SQF Port and SQF Purge Port Fees. 
The Exchange also proposes to remove 
outdated rule text at Options 7, Section 
2, BX Options Market–Fees and Rebates. 
SQF Port and SQF Purge Port Fees 
Pursuant to a prior rule change,
6
as of 
January 1, 2026, BX will assess an SQF 
Port Fee and SQF Purge Port Fee as 
follows: The first 5 ports (1–5) would be 
assessed $1,620 per port, per month; the 
next 15 ports (6–20) would be assessed 
$1,080 per port, per month; and all ports 
over 20 ports (21 and above) would be 
assessed $540 per port, per month. SR– 
BX–2025–016 amended its SQF Port 
and SQF Purge Port Fees to be identical 
to NOM’s SQF Port and SQF Purge Port 
Fees. Today, NOM aggregates its SQF 
Port and SQF Purge Port Fees for 
purposes of the tier qualification. At this 
time, to make clear the manner in which 
BX will determine qualifications for the 
SQF Port and SQF Purge Port tiers, the 
Exchange proposes to note that, ‘‘The 
SQF Port Fee and the SQF Purge Port 
Fee are aggregated for the below 
incremental tiers as follows.’’
7
 
Additionally, the Exchange would 
relocate the tier qualifications to one 
table instead of two separate tables. The 
Exchange intends to calculate SQF Ports 
and SQF Purge Ports on January 1, 2026, 
the effective date of SR–BX–2025–016, 
identical to NOM. 
Additionally, at this time, the 
Exchange proposes to offer an 
opportunity to lower SQF Port and SQF 
Purge Port Fees. Specifically, the 
Exchange proposes to offer certain 
discounts to Market Makers that have 
transacted a certain percentage of Total 
National Volume in the prior month. 
For purposes of this proposal, the 
percentage of Total National Volume is 
calculated by taking the total Market 
Maker Penny Symbol and Market Maker 
Non-Penny Symbol volume (excluding 
index options) executed on the 
Exchange in the prior month and 
attributing a multiple of five times to 
that Non-Penny Symbol volume 
(numerator) and dividing that by Market 
Maker volume (‘‘M’’ capacity at The 
Options Clearing Corporation (‘‘OCC’’)) 
in multiply listed options across all 
options exchanges (denominator or 
Total National Volume).

Cboe currently offers its market makers credits 
on their monthly BOE Bulk Port Fees. Specifically, 
if a Cboe market maker affiliate (‘‘affiliate’’ defined 
as having at least 75% common ownership between 
the two entities as reflected on each entity’s Form 
BD, Schedule A) or Cboe Appointed OFP receives 
a credit under the Exchange’s Volume Incentive 
Program (‘‘VIP’’), the Cboe market maker will 
receive an access credit on their BOE Bulk Ports 
corresponding to the VIP tier reached. The credit is 
based on the Performance Tier earned by a market 
maker under Cboe’s Liquidity Provider Sliding 
Scale Adjustment Table. Tiers 4 and 5 earn a 40% 
credit on monthly Cboe Bulk Port Fees. Cboe 
assesses BOE Bulk Logical Ports a fee of $1,500 for 
1 to 5 ports, a fee of $2,500 for 6 to 30 ports and 
a fee of $3,000 for over 30 ports. Additionally, each 
BOE Bulk Logical Port will incur the logical port 
fee indicated when used to enter up to 30,000,000 
orders per trading day per logical port as measured 
on average in a single month. Each incremental 
usage of up to 30,000,000 orders per day per BOE 
Bulk Logical Port will incur an additional logical 
port fee of $3,000 per month. Incremental usage 
will be determined on a monthly basis based on the 
Continued 
With this proposal, a Market Maker 
that transacted less than 0.10% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
would not receive a discount on SQF 
Port and SQF Purge Port Fees. A Market 
Maker that transacted greater than or 
equal to 0.10% and less than 0.25% of 
Total National Volume in the prior 
month will be afforded a discount of 
10% on their SQF Port and SQF Purge 
Port Fees. A Market Maker that 
transacted greater than or equal to 
0.25% and less than 0.40% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
will be afforded a discount of 30% on 
their SQF Port and SQF Purge Port Fees. 
Finally, a Market Maker that transacted 
greater than or equal to 0.40% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
will be afforded a discount of 50% on 
their SQF Port and SQF Purge Port Fees. 
By way of example, a Market Maker that 
executed 3,000,000 in Penny Volume 
and 200,000 in Non-Penny Volume in a 
given month on the Exchange, where 
the Total National Volume was 
1,000,000,000, would qualify for a 
discount of 50% on their SQF Port and 
SQF Purge Port Fees ((200,000 × 5 = 1,000,000) + 3,000,000 = 4,000,000 
which is 0.40% of 1,000,000,000). 
The Exchange proposes to calculate 
Market Maker Non-Penny Symbol 
volume at five times the weight as 
compared to Market Maker Penny 
Symbol volume because Non-Penny 
Symbols tend to have lower volumes 
and this incentive should encourage a 
greater amount of volume in Non-Penny 
Symbols. Overall, the proposed 
discounts should encourage Market 
Makers to transact additional order flow 
on BX with which other market 
participants may interact, for an 
opportunity to lower SQF Port and SQF 
Purge Port Fees. The Exchange proposes 
to exclude index options as index 
options are generally not multiply 
listed. 
Options 7, Section 2 
The Exchange proposes to remove 
note 4 of Options 7, Section 2 which 
states, 
Participants that increase their 
executed Customer volume which 
removes liquidity in a given month by 
at least 70% above their September 2024 
volume as measured by a percentage of 
TCV will receive a Taker Fee discount 
of $0.05 per contract in Penny Symbols 
excluding AAPL, SPY, QQQ, and IWM. 
Participants with no Customer volume 
in the remove liquidity segment for the 
month of September 2024 may qualify 
for the Taker Fee discount by having 
any new volume considered as added 
volume. This note 4 incentive will be 
available through April 30, 2025. 
The incentive located at note 4 of 
Options 7, Section 2 was available 
through April 30, 2025 and is now 
outdated. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
8
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
9
in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges 
among members and issuers and other 
persons using any facility, and is not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Commission and the courts have 
repeatedly expressed their preference 
for competition over regulatory 
intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities 
markets. In Regulation NMS, while 
adopting a series of steps to improve the 
current market model, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO 
revenues and, also, recognized that 
current regulation of the market system 
‘‘has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
10
 
Likewise, in NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission
11
 
(‘‘NetCoalition’’) the D.C. Circuit upheld 
the Commission’s use of a market-based 
approach in evaluating the fairness of 
market data fees against a challenge 
claiming that Congress mandated a cost- 
based approach.
12
As the court 
emphasized, the Commission ‘‘intended 
in Regulation NMS that ‘market forces, 
rather than regulatory requirements’ 
play a role in determining the market 
data . . . to be made available to 
investors and at what cost.’’
13
 
Further, ‘‘[n]o one disputes that 
competition for order flow is ‘fierce.’ 
. . . As the SEC explained, ‘[i]n the U.S. 
national market system, buyers and 
sellers of securities, and the broker- 
dealers that act as their order-routing 
agents, have a wide range of choices of 
where to route orders for execution’; 
[and] ‘no exchange can afford to take its 
market share percentages for granted’ 
because ‘no exchange possesses a 
monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in 
the execution of order flow from broker 
dealers’....’’
14
Although the court 
and the SEC were discussing the cash 
equities markets, the Exchange believes 
that these views apply with equal force 
to the options markets. 
SQF Port and SQF Purge Port Fees 
The proposed fee discounts for SQF 
Ports and SQF Purge Ports are 
reasonable because they will attract a 
greater amount of order flow to BX with 
which other market participants may 
interact while also lowering costs for 
certain Market Makers that are able to 
transact greater than 0.10% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month. 
The Exchange believes it is reasonable 
to lower costs for certain Market Makers 
that transact greater than 0.10% of Total 
National Volume on BX because those 
Market Makers are affording other BX 
Participants an opportunity to interact 
with that order flow. The proposal 
provides an incremental incentive for 
Market Makers that transact at least 
0.10% of Total National Volume, which 
provides a higher benefit for satisfying 
increasingly more stringent criteria. The 
Exchange believes that the value of the 
proposed discounts is commensurate 
with the difficulty to achieve the 
corresponding threshold. Additionally, 
the discounts may incentivize and 
attract more volume and liquidity to the 
Exchange, which will benefit all 
Exchange participants through 
increased opportunities to trade as well 
as enhancing price discovery. The 
Exchange’s proposed discounts are 
substantially similar to Cboe Exchange, 
Inc.’s (‘‘Cboe’’) credit for their BOE Bulk 
Port Fees.

Penny Symbols typically are more liquid 
symbols. 
17
For example, a Market Maker may desire to 
utilize multiple SQF Ports for accounting purposes, 
to measure performance, for regulatory reasons or 
other determinations that are specific to that 
Participant. 
18
Market Makers have various regulatory 
requirements as provided for in Options 2, Section 
4. Additionally, Market Makers have certain 
quoting requirements with respect to their assigned 
options series as provided in Options 2, Section 5. 
SQF is the only quoting protocol offered on BX. 
19
See Options 2, Section 5. 20
See Options 2, Section 4. 21
See Options 2, Section 4(a)(3) and (6). 22
See Options 2, Section 5. 23
See Options 2, Section 4. 24
See Options 2, Section 4(a)(3) and (6). BX believes it is reasonable to offer 
fee discounts to those Market Makers 
that primarily provide and post 
liquidity to the Exchange, as it should 
encourage Market Makers to continue to 
participate on the Exchange and add 
liquidity. Greater liquidity benefits all 
market participants by providing more 
trading opportunities and tighter 
spreads. The proposal would also 
mitigate the costs incurred by Market 
Makers on BX. 
Calculating Market Maker Non-Penny 
Symbol volume at five times the weight 
as compared to Penny Symbol volume 
is reasonable, equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory as Non-Penny Symbols 
tend to have lower volumes and this 
incentive should encourage a greater 
amount of volume in Market Maker 
Non-Penny Symbols.
16
The Exchange 
proposes to calculate the Market Maker 
Non-Penny Symbol volume in an 
uniform manner for all Participants. The 
Exchange proposes to exclude index 
options as index options are generally 
not multiply listed. Index Options 
would be uniformly excluded. 
A BX Market Maker requires only one 
SQF Port to submit quotes in its 
assigned options series into BX. A 
Market Maker may submit all quotes 
through one SQF Port. This is also the 
case for an SQF Purge Port. While a 
Market Maker may elect to obtain 
multiple SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports 
to organize its business,
17
only one SQF 
Port is necessary for a BX Market Maker 
to fulfill its regulatory quoting 
obligations.
18
 
The proposed fee discounts for SQF 
Ports and SQF Purge Ports are equitable 
and not unfairly discriminatory as they 
would apply uniformly to each BX 
Market Maker. The Exchange would 
uniformly calculate the Market Maker’s 
percentage each month. Although only 
Market Makers may receive the 
proposed discounts, the Exchange notes 
that Market Makers are valuable market 
participants that provide liquidity in the 
marketplace and incur costs that other 
market participants do not incur. Unlike 
other market participants, Market 
Makers are required to provide 
continuous two-sided quotes on a daily 
basis,
19
and are subject to various 
obligations associated with providing 
liquidity.
20
While the Exchange is not 
offering a discount to those Market 
Makers that transact less than 0.10% of 
Total National Volume, the Exchange 
notes that these Market Makers transact 
a much lower amount of contracts on 
BX as compared to other Market Makers 
who qualify for a discount. In some 
cases, these Market Makers are not 
executing the requisite amount of Penny 
Symbols or Non-Penny Symbols to 
obtain the discount. Market Makers are 
required to compete with other Market 
Makers and maintain active markets in 
all options in which the Market Maker 
is registered.
21
The Exchange believes 
that all Market Makers are capable of 
quoting tighter or in a greater amount of 
options classes to obtain the requisite 
volume to achieve a discount. 
The Exchange’s proposal to note that, 
‘‘The SQF Port Fee and the SQF Purge 
Port Fee are aggregated for the below 
incremental tiers as follows’’ and to 
relocate the tier qualifications to one 
table instead of two separate tables is 
reasonable, equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory as it will reflect that BX 
intends to calculate the SQF Port Fee 
and the SQF Purge Port Fees by 
aggregating them for purposes of the tier 
calculation. This reflects the intent of 
SR–BX–2025–016, which stated that the 
BX SQF Port Fee and the SQF Purge 
Port Fees would be identical to the 
NOM SQF Port Fee and the SQF Purge 
Port Fees. 
Options 7, Section 2 
The Exchange’s proposal to remove 
note 4 of Options 7, Section 2 is 
reasonable because the incentive was 
available through April 30, 2025 and is 
now outdated. The Exchange’s proposal 
to remove note 4 of Options 7, Section 
2 is equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory because no Participant 
would be eligible for this incentive. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
In terms of intra-market competition, 
the proposed fee discounts for SQF 
Ports and SQF Purge Ports do not 
impose a burden on competition 
because they would apply uniformly to 
each Market Maker and the Exchange 
would uniformly calculate the Market 
Maker’s percentage each month. 
Although only Market Makers may 
receive the proposed discounts, the 
Exchange notes that Market Makers are 
valuable market participants that 
provide liquidity in the marketplace and 
incur costs that other market 
participants do not incur. Unlike other 
market participants, Market Makers are 
required to provide continuous two- 
sided quotes on a daily basis,
22
and are 
subject to various obligations associated 
with providing liquidity.
23
Further, 
while the Exchange is not offering a 
discount to those Market Makers that 
transact less than 0.10% of Total 
National Volume, the Exchange notes 
that these Market Makers transact a 
much lower amount of contracts on BX 
as compared to other Market Makers 
that qualify for the discount and/or 
these Market Makers are not executing 
the requisite amount of Penny Symbols 
or Non-Penny Symbols to obtain the 
discount. The Exchange’s proposal does 
not impose an undue burden on 
competition because Market Makers are 
required to compete with other Market 
Makers and maintain active markets in 
all options in which the Market Maker 
is registered.
24
The Exchange believes 
that all Market Makers are capable of 
quoting tighter or in a greater amount of 
options classes to obtain the requisite 
volume to achieve a discount. 
The Exchange’s proposal to note that, 
‘‘The SQF Port Fee and the SQF Purge 
Port Fee are aggregated for the below 
incremental tiers as follows’’ and to 
relocate the tier qualifications to one 
table instead of two separate tables does 
not impose an undue burden on 
competition as it will reflect that BX 
intends to calculate the SQF Port Fee 
and the SQF Purge Port Fees by 
aggregating them for purposes of the tier 
calculation. This reflects the intent of 
SR–BX–2025–016, which stated that the 
BX SQF Port Fee and the SQF Purge 
Port Fees would be identical to the 
NOM SQF Port Fee and the SQF Purge 
Port Fees. 
The Exchange’s proposal to remove 
note 4 of Options 7, Section 2 does not 
impose an undue burden on 
competition because no Participant 
would be eligible for this incentive. 
In terms of inter-market competition, 
the Exchange notes that it operates in a 
highly competitive market in which 
market participants can readily favor 
competing venues if they deem fee 
levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive, or rebate opportunities

‘‘Specialized Quote Feed’’ or ‘‘SQF’’ is an 
interface that allows Market Makers to connect, 
send, and receive messages related to quotes, 
Immediate-or-Cancel Orders, and auction responses 
into and from the Exchange. Features include the 
following: (1) options symbol directory messages 
(e.g., underlying instruments); (2) system event messages (e.g., start of trading hours messages and start of opening); (3) trading action messages (e.g., 
halts and resumes); (4) execution messages; (5) 
quote messages; (6) Immediate-or-Cancel Order 
messages; (7) risk protection triggers and purge 
notifications; (8) opening imbalance messages; (9) 
auction notifications; and (10) auction responses. 
The SQF Purge Interface only receives and notifies 
of purge requests from the Market Maker. Market 
Makers may only enter interest into SQF in their 
assigned options series. Immediate-or-Cancel 
Orders entered into SQF are not subject to the Order 
Price Protection, Market Order Spread Protection, 
or Size Limitation Protection in Options 3, Section 
15(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(2) respectively. See Options 3, Section 7(e)(1)(B).

On December 8, 2025 the Exchange filed SR– 
NASDAQ–2025–100. On December 16, 2025 the 
Exchange withdrew SR–NASDAQ–2025–100 and 
filed this rule change.

The term ‘‘NOM Market Maker’’ or (‘‘M’’) is a 
Participant that has registered as a Market Maker on 
NOM pursuant to Options 2, Section 1, and must 
Continued 
available at other venues to be more 
favorable. In such an environment, the 
Exchange must continually adjust its 
fees to remain competitive with other 
options exchanges. In addition to the 
Exchange, market participants have 
alternative options exchanges that they 
may participate on and direct their 
order flow. In sum, if the changes 
proposed herein are unattractive to 
market participants, it is likely that the 
Exchange will lose market share as a 
result. Accordingly, the Exchange does 
not believe that the proposed changes 
will impair the ability of members or 
competing options exchanges to 
maintain their competitive standing in 
the financial markets.

(‘‘Nasdaq’’ or ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘SEC’’ or ‘‘Commission’’) the proposed 
rule change as described in Items I, II, 
and III, below, which Items have been

Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
NOM proposes to amend its SQF Port 
and SQF Purge Port pricing at Options 
7, Section 3, Nasdaq Options Market— 
Ports and other Services by offering an 
incentive to Market Makers

Id. at 539 (quoting Securities Exchange Act Release No. 59039 (December 2, 2008), 73 FR 
74770, 74782–83 (December 9, 2008) (SR– 
NYSEArca–2006–21)). 
NOM currently assess an SQF Port 
Fee and an SQF Purge Port Fee as 
follows: The first 5 ports (1–5) would be 
assessed $1,620 per port, per month; the 
next 15 ports (6–20) would be assessed 
$1,080 per port, per month; and all ports 
over 20 ports (21 and above) would be 
assessed $540 per port, per month. 
Today, NOM aggregates the SQF Port 
and SQF Purge Ports for purposes of 
determining the applicable tier 
qualification. 
At this time, the Exchange proposes to 
amend the rule text to state, ‘‘The SQF 
Port Fee and the SQF Purge Port Fee are 
aggregated for the below incremental 
tiers as follows.’’ The addition of this 
language will add clarity to the current 
billing of these port. 
Additionally, at this time, the 
Exchange proposes to offer an 
opportunity to lower SQF Port and SQF 
Purge Port Fees. Specifically, the 
Exchange proposes to offer certain 
discounts to Market Makers that have 
transacted a certain percentage of Total 
National Volume in the prior month. 
For purposes of this proposal, the 
percentage of Total National Volume is 
calculated by taking the total Market 
Maker Penny Symbol and Market Maker 
Non-Penny Symbol volume (excluding 
index options) executed on the 
Exchange in the prior month and 
attributing a multiple of five times to 
that Non-Penny Symbol volume 
(numerator) and dividing that by Market 
Maker volume (‘‘M’’ capacity at The 
Options Clearing Corporation (‘‘OCC’’)) 
in multiply listed options across all 
options exchanges (denominator or 
Total National Volume). 
Tier Percentage of Total National Volume Percentage SQF Port and 
SQF Purge Port discount 
1 ........................ less than 0.10% ....................................................................................................................... 0 2 ........................ greater than or equal to 0.10% and less than 0.25% ............................................................. 10 3 ........................ greater than or equal to 0.25% and less than 0.40% ............................................................. 30 4 ........................ greater than or equal to 0.40% ................................................................................................ 50 With this proposal, a Market Maker 
that transacted less than 0.10% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
would not receive a discount on SQF 
Port and SQF Purge Port Fees. A Market 
Maker that transacted greater than or 
equal to 0.10% and less than 0.25% of 
Total National Volume in the prior 
month will be afforded a discount of 
10% on their SQF Port and SQF Purge 
Port Fees. A Market Maker that 
transacted greater than or equal to 
0.25% and less than 0.40% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
will be afforded a discount of 30% on 
their SQF Port and SQF Purge Port Fees. 
Finally, a Market Maker that transacted 
greater than or equal to 0.40% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
will be afforded a discount of 50% on 
their SQF Port and SQF Purge Port Fees. 
By way of example, a Market Maker that 
executed 3,000,000 in Penny Volume 
and 200,000 in Non-Penny Volume in a 
given month on the Exchange, where 
the Total National Volume was 
1,000,000,000, would qualify for a 
discount of 50% on their SQF Port and 
SQF Purge Port Fees ((200,000 × 5 = 1,000,000) + 3,000,000 = 4,000,000 
which is 0.40% of 1,000,000,000). 
The Exchange proposes to calculate 
Market Maker Non-Penny Symbol 
volume at five times the weight as 
compared to Market Maker Penny 
Symbol volume because Non-Penny 
Symbols tend to have lower volumes 
and this incentive should encourage a 
greater amount of volume in Non-Penny 
Symbols. Overall, the proposed 
discounts should encourage Market 
Makers to transact additional order flow 
on NOM with which other market 
participants may interact, for an 
opportunity to lower SQF Port and SQF 
Purge Port Fees. The Exchange proposes 
to exclude index options as index 
options are generally not multiply 
listed. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
6
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
7
in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges 
among members and issuers and other 
persons using any facility, and is not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Commission and the courts have 
repeatedly expressed their preference 
for competition over regulatory 
intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities 
markets. In Regulation NMS, while 
adopting a series of steps to improve the 
current market model, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO 
revenues and, also, recognized that 
current regulation of the market system 
‘‘has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
8
 
Likewise, in NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission
9
 
(‘‘NetCoalition’’) the D.C. Circuit upheld 
the Commission’s use of a market-based 
approach in evaluating the fairness of 
market data fees against a challenge 
claiming that Congress mandated a cost- 
based approach.
10
As the court 
emphasized, the Commission ‘‘intended 
in Regulation NMS that ‘market forces, 
rather than regulatory requirements’ 
play a role in determining the market 
data . . . to be made available to 
investors and at what cost.’’
11
 
Further, ‘‘[n]o one disputes that 
competition for order flow is ‘fierce.’ 
. . . As the SEC explained, ‘[i]n the U.S. 
national market system, buyers and 
sellers of securities, and the broker- 
dealers that act as their order-routing 
agents, have a wide range of choices of 
where to route orders for execution’; 
[and] ‘no exchange can afford to take its 
market share percentages for granted’ 
because ‘no exchange possesses a 
monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in 
the execution of order flow from broker 
dealers’....’’
12
Although the court 
and the SEC were discussing the cash 
equities markets, the Exchange believes 
that these views apply with equal force 
to the options markets. 
The proposed fee discounts for SQF 
Ports and SQF Purge Ports are 
reasonable because they will attract a 
greater amount of order flow to NOM 
with which other market participants

Cboe currently offers its market makers credits 
on their monthly BOE Bulk Port Fees. Specifically, 
if a Cboe market maker affiliate (‘‘affiliate’’ defined 
as having at least 75% common ownership between 
the two entities as reflected on each entity’s Form 
BD, Schedule A) or Cboe Appointed OFP receives 
a credit under the Exchange’s Volume Incentive 
Program (‘‘VIP’’), the Cboe market maker will 
receive an access credit on their BOE Bulk Ports 
corresponding to the VIP tier reached. The credit is 
based on the Performance Tier earned by a market 
maker under Cboe’s Liquidity Provider Sliding 
Scale Adjustment Table. Tiers 4 and 5 earn a 40% 
credit on monthly Cboe Bulk Port Fees. Cboe 
assesses BOE Bulk Logical Ports a fee of $1,500 for 
1 to 5 ports, a fee of $2,500 for 6 to 30 ports and 
a fee of $3,000 for over 30 ports. Additionally, each 
BOE Bulk Logical Port will incur the logical port 
fee indicated when used to enter up to 30,000,000 
orders per trading day per logical port as measured 
on average in a single month. Each incremental 
usage of up to 30,000,000 orders per day per BOE 
Bulk Logical Port will incur an additional logical 
port fee of $3,000 per month. Incremental usage 
will be determined on a monthly basis based on the 
average orders per day entered in a single month 
across all subscribed BOE Bulk Logical Ports. 
14
Penny Symbols typically are more liquid 
symbols. 
15
For example, a Market Maker may desire to 
utilize multiple SQF Ports for accounting purposes, 
to measure performance, for regulatory reasons or 
other determinations that are specific to that 
Participant. 
16
Market Makers have various regulatory 
requirements as provided for in Options 2, Section 
4. Additionally, Market Makers have certain 
quoting requirements with respect to their assigned 
options series as provided in Options 2, Section 5. 
NOM also offers a QUO protocol. Orders submitted 
by Market Makers into QUO are treated as quotes. 
17
See Options 2, Section 5. 18
See Options 2, Section 4. 19
See Options 2, Section 4(a)(3) and (6). 20
See Options 2, Section 5. 21
See Options 2, Section 4. 22
See Options 2, Section 4(a)(3) and (6). may interact while also lowering costs 
for certain Market Makers that are able 
to transact greater than 0.10% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month. 
The Exchange believes it is reasonable 
to lower costs for certain Market Makers 
that transact greater than 0.10% of Total 
National Volume on NOM because those 
Market Makers are affording other NOM 
Participants an opportunity to interact 
with that order flow. The proposal 
provides an incremental incentive for 
Market Makers that transact at least 
0.10% of Total National Volume, which 
provides a higher benefit for satisfying 
increasingly more stringent criteria. The 
Exchange believes that the value of the 
proposed discounts is commensurate 
with the difficulty to achieve the 
corresponding threshold. Additionally, 
the discounts may incentivize and 
attract more volume and liquidity to the 
Exchange, which will benefit all 
Exchange participants through 
increased opportunities to trade as well 
as enhancing price discovery. The 
Exchange’s proposed discounts are 
substantially similar to Cboe Exchange, 
Inc.’s (‘‘Cboe’’) credit for their BOE Bulk 
Port Fees.
13
 
NOM believes it is reasonable to offer 
fee discounts to those Market Makers 
that primarily provide and post 
liquidity to the Exchange, as it should 
encourage Market Makers to continue to 
participate on the Exchange and add 
liquidity. Greater liquidity benefits all 
market participants by providing more 
trading opportunities and tighter 
spreads. The proposal would also 
mitigate the costs incurred by Market 
Makers on NOM. 
Calculating Market Maker Non-Penny 
Symbol volume at five times the weight 
as compared to Penny Symbol volume 
is reasonable, equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory as Non-Penny Symbols 
tend to have lower volumes and this 
incentive should encourage a greater 
amount of volume in Market Maker 
Non-Penny Symbols.
14
The Exchange 
proposes to calculate the Market Maker 
Non-Penny Symbol volume in an 
uniform manner for all Participants. The 
Exchange proposes to exclude index 
options as index options are generally 
not multiply listed. Index Options 
would be uniformly excluded. 
A NOM Market Maker requires only 
one SQF Port to submit quotes in its 
assigned options series into NOM. A 
Market Maker may submit all quotes 
through one SQF Port. This is also the 
case for an SQF Purge Port. While a 
Market Maker may elect to obtain 
multiple SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports 
to organize its business,
15
only one SQF 
Port is necessary for a NOM Market 
Maker to fulfill its regulatory quoting 
obligations.
16
 
The proposed fee discounts for SQF 
Ports and SQF Purge Ports are equitable 
and not unfairly discriminatory as they 
would apply uniformly to each NOM 
Market Maker. The Exchange would 
uniformly calculate the Market Maker’s 
percentage each month. Although only 
Market Makers may receive the 
proposed discounts, the Exchange notes 
that Market Makers are valuable market 
participants that provide liquidity in the 
marketplace and incur costs that other 
market participants do not incur. Unlike 
other market participants, Market 
Makers are required to provide 
continuous two-sided quotes on a daily 
basis,
17
and are subject to various 
obligations associated with providing 
liquidity.
18
While the Exchange is not 
offering a discount to those Market 
Makers that transact less than 0.10% of 
Total National Volume, the Exchange 
notes that these Market Makers transact 
a much lower amount of contracts on 
NOM as compared to other Market 
Makers who qualify for a discount. In 
some cases, these Market Makers are not 
executing the requisite amount of Penny 
Symbols or Non-Penny Symbols to 
obtain the discount. Market Makers are 
required to compete with other Market 
Makers and maintain active markets in 
all options in which the Market Maker 
is registered.
19
The Exchange believes 
that all Market Makers are capable of 
quoting tighter or in a greater amount of 
options classes to obtain the requisite 
volume to achieve a discount. 
The Exchange’s proposal to amend 
the rule text to state, ‘‘The SQF Port Fee 
and the SQF Purge Port Fee are 
aggregated for the below incremental 
tiers as follows’’ is reasonable, equitable 
and not unfairly discriminatory. The 
addition of this language will add 
clarity to the current billing of these 
port. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
In terms of intra-market competition, 
the proposed fee discounts for SQF 
Ports and SQF Purge Ports do not 
impose a burden on competition 
because they would apply uniformly to 
each Market Maker and the Exchange 
would uniformly calculate the Market 
Maker’s percentage each month. 
Although only Market Makers may 
receive the proposed discounts, the 
Exchange notes that Market Makers are 
valuable market participants that 
provide liquidity in the marketplace and 
incur costs that other market 
participants do not incur. Unlike other 
market participants, Market Makers are 
required to provide continuous two- 
sided quotes on a daily basis,
20
and are 
subject to various obligations associated 
with providing liquidity.
21
Further, 
while the Exchange is not offering a 
discount to those Market Makers that 
transact less than 0.10% of Total 
National Volume, the Exchange notes 
that these Market Makers transact a 
much lower amount of contracts on 
NOM as compared to other Market 
Makers that qualify for the discount 
and/or these Market Makers are not 
executing the requisite amount of Penny 
Symbols or Non-Penny Symbols to 
obtain the discount. The Exchange’s 
proposal does not impose an undue 
burden on competition because Market 
Makers are required to compete with 
other Market Makers and maintain 
active markets in all options in which 
the Market Maker is registered.

Exchange believes that all Market 
Makers are capable of quoting tighter or 
in a greater amount of options classes to 
obtain the requisite volume to achieve a 
discount. 
The Exchange’s proposal to amend 
the rule text to state, ‘‘The SQF Port Fee 
and the SQF Purge Port Fee are 
aggregated for the below incremental 
tiers as follows’’ does not impose an 
undue burden on competition because 
the addition of this language will add 
clarity to the current billing of these 
port. 
In terms of inter-market competition, 
the Exchange notes that it operates in a 
highly competitive market in which 
market participants can readily favor 
competing venues if they deem fee 
levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive, or rebate opportunities 
available at other venues to be more 
favorable. In such an environment, the 
Exchange must continually adjust its 
fees to remain competitive with other 
options exchanges. In addition to the 
Exchange, market participants have 
alternative options exchanges that they 
may participate on and direct their 
order flow. In sum, if the changes 
proposed herein are unattractive to 
market participants, it is likely that the 
Exchange will lose market share as a 
result. Accordingly, the Exchange does 
not believe that the proposed changes 
will impair the ability of members or 
competing options exchanges to 
maintain their competitive standing in 
the financial markets.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Exchange Rules 11.180 and 14.002 to 
conform with a recent amendment to 
the definition of Round Lot under Rule 
600 of Regulation NMS recently 
approved by the Commission.
4
The 
Exchange also proposes to make 
conforming non-substantive changes to 
Exchange Rules 11.151(a)(1), Two-Sided 
Quote Obligation, 11.220, Priority of 
Orders, and 14.310, Initial Listing 
Requirements for Primary Equity 
Securities. 
In 2020, the Commission adopted 
amendments to Regulation NMS to 
modernize the NMS information 
provided within the national market 
system for the benefit of market 
participants and to better achieve 
Section 11A’s goals of assuring ‘‘the 
availability to brokers, dealers, and 
investors of information with respect to 
quotations for and transactions in 
securities that is prompt, accurate, 
reliable, and fair’’ (‘‘MDI Rules’’).
5
 
These changes included an amendment 
to Rule 600 of Regulation NMS to 
include a definition of ‘‘round lot’’ that 
assigns each NMS stock to a round lot 
size based on the stock’s average closing 
price. Prior to this change, a ‘‘round lot’’ 
was not defined in the Act or Regulation 
NMS. The definition of a ‘‘round lot’’ 
was included in the rules of each 
exchange, including Exchange Rules 
11.180 and 14.002, which typically 
defined a ‘‘Round Lot’’ as 100 shares, 
but they also allowed the exchange, or 
the primary listing exchange for the 
stock, discretion to define it otherwise. 
In light of delays in the 
implementation of the MDI Rules, 
including the definition of round lot, on 
September 18, 2024, the Commission, 
among other things, accelerated the 
implementation of the round lot 
definition. The Commission also revised 
the round lot definition as set forth 
below.
6
Rule 600(b)(93) of Regulation 
NMS, as adopted by the MDI Rules and 
as amended in 2024,
7
defines a round 
lot for NMS stocks
8
that have an 
average closing price on the primary 
listing exchange during the prior 
Evaluation Period
9
of: (1) $250.00 or 
less per share as 100 shares; (2) $250.01 
to $1,000.00 per share as 40 shares; (3) 
$1,000.01 to $10,000.00 per share as 10 
shares; and (4) $10,000.01 or more per 
share as 1 share. For any security that 
becomes an NMS Stock during an 
operative period, as described in Rule 
600(b)(93)(iv),
10
a round lot is 100 
shares. Adjustments to the round lot 
size for a security will occur on a 
semiannual basis and the calculation of 
the average closing price on the primary 
listing exchange will be based on a one 
month ‘‘Evaluation Period.’’ 
The implementation of the 
Commission’s revised definition was 
required to be completed on November 
3, 2025, and the Commission provided 
temporary exemptive relief to exchanges 
from the requirement to file proposed 
rule changes to amend their rules to 
reflect the round lot definition in Rule 
600(b)(93) of Regulation NMS until 30 
calendar days following the end of the 
lapse of appropriations.
11
The Exchange 
now proposes to amend Exchange Rules 
11.180 and 14.002 to conform with the 
definition of Round Lot under Rule 600 
of the Regulation NMS. 
Exchange Rule 11.180(q)(1) provides 
that ‘‘[o]ne hundred (100) shares or any 
multiple thereof shall constitute a 
Round Lot, unless an alternative 
number of shares is established as a 
Round Lot by the listing exchange for 
the security.’’ The Exchange proposes to 
replace this definition with a sentence 
that explicitly refers to the definition of 
round lots under Rule 600 of Regulation 
NMS. As a result, the above sentence 
will be deleted and replaced with the 
following, ‘‘For any NMS stock, the 
‘‘Round Lot’’ shall be the size assigned 
by the primary listing market pursuant 
to Rule 600 of Regulation NMS under 
the Exchange Act.’’ 
Similarly, Exchange Rule 14.002(a)(1) 
provides ‘‘ ‘‘Round Lot’’ or ‘‘Normal 
Unit of Trading’’ means 100 shares of a 
security[,]’’ and provides that the 
Exchange may determine when a 
‘‘Round Lot’’ would not mean 100 
shares. The Exchange now proposes to 
also amend Exchange Rule 14.002(a)(1) 
to explicitly refer to the definition of a 
round lot under Rule 600 of Regulation 
NMS. Again, the Exchange proposes 
these changes solely to conform the 
Exchange’s definition of Round Lot 
under Exchange Rule 11.180(q)(1) and 
Exchange Rule 14.002(a)(1) to the new 
definition of Round Lot under Rule 600 
of Regulation NMS. 
The Exchange also proposes to make 
conforming non-substantive changes to 
Exchange Rule 11.151(a)(1), Two-Sided 
Quote Obligation. Exchange Rule 
11.151(a)(1) currently provides that 
‘‘[u]nless otherwise designated, a 
‘normal unit of trading’ shall be 100 
shares.’’ The Exchange proposes to 
replace the aforementioned sentence 
with a sentence that conforms to the 
newly adopted definition of Round Lot 
in the Exchange’s Rulebook. As a result, 
the above sentence will be removed and 
replaced with the following: ‘‘[u]nless 
otherwise designated, a ‘normal unit of 
trading’ shall be a Round Lot as defined 
in Exchange Rule 11.180.’’ The 
Exchange also proposes to make 
conforming non-substantive changes to 
Exchange Rules 11.220, Priority of 
Orders and 14.310, Initial Listing 
Requirements for Primary Equity 
Securities. The Exchange proposes to 
capitalize the term Round Lot in each of 
these rules. The purpose of these 
changes is to provide greater clarity to 
exchange members and the public 
regarding the Rulebook. The Exchange 
does not propose any additional 
changes to these rules. 
Implementation Date 
The proposed rule changes will be 
implemented on December 12, 2025. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the provisions of Section 6 of the Act,
12
 
in general, and furthers the objectives of 
Section 6(b)(1)
13
in particular, in that it 
enables the Exchange to be so organized 
as to have the capacity to be able to 
carry out the purposes of the Act and to 
comply, and to enforce compliance by 
its exchange members and persons 
associated with its exchange members, 
with the provisions of the Act, the rules 
and regulations thereunder, and the 
rules of the Exchange. The Exchange 
also believed that the proposed rule 
change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5)

the proposed rule change, along with a brief 
description and text of the proposed rule change, 
at least five business days prior to the date of filing 
of the proposed rule change, or such shorter time 
as designated by the Commission. The Exchange 
has satisfied this requirement.

See supra note 3. 
24
For purposes only of waiving the 30-day 
operative delay, the Commission has also 
considered the proposed rule’s impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(f). 
of the Act
14
in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to foster cooperation and 
coordination with persons engaged in 
facilitating transactions in securities, to 
remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest. 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Exchange Rules 11.180 and 14.002 to 
conform with the definition of Round 
Lot under Rule 600 of the Regulation 
NMS that is to be implemented in 
November 2025.
15
These changes are 
being proposed solely to conform the 
Exchange’s definition of ‘‘Round Lot’’ 
under Exchange Rules 11.180 and 
14.002 to the new definition of Round 
Lot under Rule 600 of Regulation NMS. 
The Exchange also proposes to make 
conforming nonsubstantive changes to 
Rules 11.151(a)(1), Two-Sided Quote 
Obligation, 11.220, Priority of Orders, 
and 14.310, Initial Listing Requirements 
for Primary Equity Securities. These 
changes are limited to capitalizing the 
term Round Lot in each of these rules 
to conform with the changes to 
Exchange Rules 11.180 and 14.002. 
The proposed rule changes would 
reduce potential investor and market 
participant confusion and therefore 
remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system by 
ensuring that the Exchange’s rules 
properly reflect the requirements of 
Rule 600 of Regulation NMS. The 
Exchange also believes that the 
proposed rule changes would remove 
impediments to and perfects the 
mechanism of a free and open market by 
ensuring that persons subject to the 
Exchange’s jurisdiction, regulators, and 
the investing public can more easily 
navigate and understand the Exchange’s 
rules. The proposed rule changes would 
not be inconsistent with the public 
interest and the protection of investors 
because investors will not be harmed 
and in fact would benefit from the 
increased transparency and clarity, 
thereby reducing potential confusion. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule changes do not impose any burden 
on intramarket or intermarket 
competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. The proposed rule 
changes to amend the definition of 
Round Lot are not intended to address 
competitive issues but rather are 
concerned solely with amending the 
Exchange’s Rules to conform with the 
amended definition of Round Lot under 
Rule 600 of the Regulation NMS.
16
The 
proposed rule change to capitalize the 
term Round Lot in additional rules is 
conforming and non-substantive in 
nature, and is not intended to address 
competitive issues. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received comments on the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The Exchange has filed the proposed 
rule change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act
17
and Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6)
18
thereunder. Because the 
foregoing proposed rule change does 
not: (i) significantly affect the protection 
of investors or the public interest; (ii) 
impose any significant burden on 
competition; and (iii) become operative 
for 30 days from the date on which it 
was filed, or such shorter time as the 
Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act
19
and Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6)
20
thereunder. 
A proposed rule change filed under 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
21
normally does not 
become operative prior to 30 days after 
the date of the filing. However, pursuant 
to Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii),
22
the 
Commission may designate a shorter 
time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public 
interest. The Exchange has asked the 
Commission to waive the 30-day 
operative delay so that the proposed 
rule change may become operative 
immediately upon filing. The Exchange 
states that the proposed changes will 
not adversely impact investors and are 
solely designed to comply with the 
revised definition of Round Lot under 
Rule 600 of Regulation NMS recently 
approved by the Commission.
23
The 
Exchange also states that it is the public 
interest for the Rulebook to be specific, 
clear, and transparent, and that the 
proposed change would promote those 
interests. For these reasons, and because 
the proposed rule change does not raise 
any novel legal or regulatory issues, the 
Commission finds that waiver of the 30- 
day operative delay is consistent with 
the protection of investors and the 
public interest. Therefore, the 
Commission hereby waives the 30-day 
operative delay and designates the 
proposed rule change to be operative 
upon filing.
24
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES 
TRADE REPRESENTATIVE 
Notice of Action: China’s Acts, 
Policies, and Practices Related to 
Targeting of the Semiconductor 
Industry for Dominance 
AGENCY: Office of the United States Trade Representative. 
ACTION: Notice of action. SUMMARY: The United States Trade Representative (U.S. Trade 
Representative) has determined that 
China’s acts, policies, and practices are 
actionable under Section 301 of the 
Trade Act of 1974 and that appropriate 
responsive action includes taking tariff 
action now on semiconductors from 
China, with an initial tariff level of 0 
percent, increasing in 18 months on 
June 23, 2027, to a rate to be announced 
not fewer than 30 days prior to that 
date, as described below. 
DATES: December 23, 2025: The effective date of the action. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Philip Butler, Chair of the Section 301 
Committee or Nathaniel Halvorson, 
Deputy Assistant U.S. Trade 
Representative for Monitoring & 
Enforcement at (202) 395–5725. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
On December 23, 2024, the U.S. Trade 
Representative initiated a section 301 
investigation of China’s acts, policies, 
and practices related to targeting of the 
semiconductor industry for dominance, 
including to the extent that China’s 
semiconductors are incorporated as 
components into downstream products 
for critical industries like defense, 
automotive, medical devices, aerospace, 
telecommunications, and power 
generation and the electrical grid.
1
The 
U.S. Trade Representative also 
requested consultations with the 
Government of China pursuant to 
Section 303 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 
2413). The Government of China 
declined to hold consultations regarding 
the investigation under this statutory 
framework. The notice of initiation 
solicited written comments on, inter 
alia: 
€China’s acts, policies, and practices related to its targeting of the 
semiconductor industry for dominance. 
€Anticompetitive and non-market means employed by the PRC in pursuit 
of its semiconductor industry targeting 
objectives, including political guidance, 
directives, and control within state and 
private enterprises, activities of state- 
owned or state-controlled enterprises, 
market access restrictions, opaque 
regulatory preferences and 
discrimination, wage-suppressing labor 
practices, massive state support of 
industry (including government 
guidance funds), and forced technology 
transfer (including state-directed cyber 
intrusions and cybertheft of intellectual 
property). 
€Whether China’s acts, policies, and practices are unreasonable or 
discriminatory. 
€Whether China’s acts, policies, and practices burden or restrict U.S. 
commerce, and if so, the nature and 
level of the burden or restriction. This 
would include economic assessments of 
the burden or restriction on 
semiconductors, semiconductor 
manufacturing including foundries, 
silicon carbide substrates or other 
wafers, and downstream products, with 
a particular focus on critical industries, 
such as defense, automotive, medical 
devices, aerospace, telecommunications, 
and power generation and the electrical 
grid. 
€Whether China’s acts, policies, and practices are actionable under section 
301(b) of the Trade Act, and what 
action, if any, should be taken, 
including tariff and non-tariff actions. 
Interested persons filed 26 comments. 
In addition, USTR and the Section 301 
Committee convened a public hearing 
on March 11, 2025, during which 
witnesses provided testimony and 
responded to questions. The public 
submissions are available at: https://
comments.ustr.gov/s/ in docket number USTR–2024–0024, and a transcript of 
the hearing is available on USTR’s 
website. 
II. Determination of Actionability 
Based on information obtained during 
the investigation, and in consultation 
with the Section 301 Committee, 
China’s targeting of the semiconductor 
industry for dominance is unreasonable 
and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce 
and thus is actionable. 
For decades, China has targeted the 
semiconductor industry for dominance 
and has employed increasingly 
aggressive and sweeping non-market 
policies and practices in pursuing 
dominance of the sector. China’s pursuit 
of its dominance goals has severely 
disadvantaged U.S. companies, workers, 
and the U.S. economy generally through 
lessened competition and commercial 
opportunities and through the creation 
of economic security risks from 
dependencies and vulnerabilities. 
Top-down industrial planning is a 
critical feature of China’s state-led, non- 
market economic system. China 
organizes the development of its 
economy through broad, national-level 
five-year economic and social 
development plans. It then employs 
industry-specific plans and local plans 
at central and sub-central levels of 
government that typically align 
chronologically with the national five- 
year plans. These plans often contain 
detailed quantitative and qualitative 
targets, including for production, 
domestic content, domestic and 
international market shares, and outline 
the non-market policies and practices 
China should use to achieve these 
targets. 
Over the last 25 years, China has 
promulgated over 100 central and sub- 
central industrial plans that address the 
semiconductor industry, articulating 
over 300 qualitative and 170 
quantitative targets that seek to capture 
global and domestic market share, 
transfer technology, and indigenize the 
equipment needed to manufacture 
semiconductors. In its last publicly- 
released market share target for the 
semiconductor sector, China aimed to 
capture 56 percent of sales in the 
international market and 80 percent in 
the domestic market, according to 
industrial plans. Market share targets 
necessitate substitution by Chinese 
companies at the expense of foreign 
competitors—for Chinese companies to 
gain market share, they must displace 
foreign companies in existing markets 
and take new markets as they develop 
in the future. Across both qualitative 
and quantitative targets, China’s 
industrial plans target every major 
segment of the semiconductor supply 
chain, including fabrication; design; 
assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP); 
and materials & equipment. 
Unreasonable Acts, Policies, and 
Practices 
In particular, the U.S. Trade 
Representative has determined that 
China’s targeting of the semiconductor 
industry for dominance is unreasonable, 
including for the following reasons: 
First, China’s targeting of the 
semiconductor industry is unreasonable 
because China exerts extraordinary 
control over the semiconductor 
industry, and other economic actors, in 
order to achieve its targeted dominance, 
including through political guidance, 
directives, and control within state and 
private enterprises, activities of state- 
owned or state-controlled enterprises. 
Adherence to the objectives of China’s 
industrial plans is effectively 
mandatory. Both state actors and 
Chinese companies move toward the 
goals set by the central government and 
have little discretion to ignore China’s

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60849 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices industrial targets. The Chinese 
Communist Party also exerts control 
through personnel and enterprise 
structures. China’s control over 
economic actors enables China to direct 
and influence their commercial 
behavior in pursuit of its targeted 
dominance, in ways that run counter to 
fair competition and market-oriented 
principles. 
Through its control of economic 
actors and sectors, China directs non- 
market advantages to China’s 
semiconductor industry across every 
major segment of the semiconductor 
supply chain, including fabrication, 
design, ATP, materials, critical 
minerals, chemicals, photoresists, and 
manufacturing equipment. These non- 
market advantages include massive and 
persistent state financial support of 
industry, including market access 
restrictions and direction; government 
guidance funds; forced technology 
transfer and intellectual property theft; 
opaque regulatory preferences and 
discrimination; and wage-suppressing 
labor practices. Thus, China’s targeting 
of the semiconductor industry for 
dominance is unreasonable because of 
China’s extraordinary control over its 
economic actors and ability to direct 
non-market advantages to its 
semiconductor industry. 
Second, China’s targeting of the 
semiconductor industry for dominance 
is unreasonable because it is does not 
reflect market competition and is 
unconstrained by market forces. China’s 
targeting, both by design and in effect, 
displaces foreign firms, deprives 
market-oriented businesses and their 
workers of commercial opportunities, 
and lessens competition. China’s plans, 
including as demonstrated by specific 
market share targets, are to achieve a 
long-term dominant position in these 
economic sectors. Its targeting of the 
industry for dominance necessarily 
means displacing foreign firms from 
existing markets, and taking new 
markets as they arise, diminishing 
competition. Foreign firms are 
increasingly unable to compete with the 
resources of the Chinese state, resulting 
in lost sales, under-investment in 
capacity, diminished ability to attract 
financing, and lost jobs and lower 
wages. The dominant positions China 
seeks, and increasingly achieves, in 
numerous segments of the 
semiconductor industry give it market 
power over global supply, pricing, and 
access. 
Third, China’s targeting of the 
semiconductor industry for dominance 
harms foreign competitors and 
purchasers by creating and exploiting 
dependencies. China’s objective is to 
ultimately displace foreign competitors 
throughout the semiconductor value 
chain in domestic and foreign markets, 
which increases the world’s dependence 
on its companies, products, services, 
and technology. The creation of 
dependencies also increases risk for 
individual firms and their workers, for 
economic sectors (including workers’ 
communities), and for supply chain 
resilience. China has demonstrated in 
the past its willingness to weaponize 
dependencies for purposes of economic 
coercion, including in this sector 
through export restrictions on gallium, 
germanium, antimony, and other critical 
minerals. China has applied these 
export restrictions broadly without 
regard to end-use or end-users. China’s 
targeting of this sector for dominance is 
therefore unreasonable also due to the 
creation of dependencies and resulting 
vulnerabilities and risks. 
Burden or Restriction on U.S. Commerce 
Furthermore, the U.S. Trade 
Representative determined that China’s 
targeting of the semiconductor industry 
for dominance burdens or restricts U.S. 
commerce, including for the following 
reasons: 
First, China’s targeted dominance 
burdens or restricts U.S. commerce 
because it undercuts business 
opportunities for and investments in the 
U.S. semiconductor industry. China has 
targeted the semiconductor industry for 
dominance for decades and increasingly 
dominates segments of the 
semiconductor value chain. Indeed, 
China continues to build upon its 
dominance and seeks to expand into 
new segments of the value chain. 
China’s targeting for dominance 
contributes to lost sales, chronic 
underinvestment in numerous 
segments, and a diminished U.S. 
industry, constituting a burden and 
restriction on U.S. commerce. 
Second, China’s targeting for 
dominance burdens or restricts U.S. 
commerce because it creates economic 
security risks from dependence and 
vulnerabilities in sectors critical to the 
functioning of the U.S. economy. 
China’s targeting for dominance has 
created, and will continue to accelerate, 
dependencies for the U.S. 
semiconductor industry and for 
purchasers of semiconductors, creating 
vulnerabilities across the U.S. economy. 
China has also revealed the capacity and 
willingness to weaponize dependencies 
and vulnerabilities through economic 
coercion. Over-reliance on a single 
economy for semiconductors and 
related technology or products increases 
the cost of any disruption. The 
economic security risks U.S. firms and 
the U.S. economy bear from these 
dependencies and vulnerabilities, 
through their potential for disruption 
and coercion, burden or restrict U.S. 
commerce. 
III. Determination of Appropriate 
Action 
Section 301(b) provides that upon 
determining that the acts, policies, and 
practices under investigation are 
actionable and that action is 
appropriate, the U.S. Trade 
Representative shall take all appropriate 
and feasible action authorized under 
Section 301(c), subject to the specific 
direction, if any, of the President 
regarding such action, and all other 
appropriate and feasible action within 
the power of the President that the 
President may direct the U.S. Trade 
Representative to take under Section 
301(b), to obtain the elimination of that 
act, policy, or practice. Section 301(c) of 
the Trade Act authorizes the U.S. Trade 
Representative to take certain actions for 
purposes of carrying out the provisions 
of Section 301(b). For example, Section 
301(c)(1)(B) authorizes the U.S. Trade 
Representative to ‘‘impose duties or 
other import restrictions on the goods of 
[the foreign country subject to the 
investigation] and, notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, fees or 
restrictions on the services of, such 
foreign country for such time as the 
Trade Representative determines 
appropriate.’’ Section 301(c)(3)(A) 
provides that actions that the U.S. Trade 
Representative is authorized to take may 
be taken against any good or economic 
sector on a non-discriminatory basis or 
solely against the foreign country 
concerned. 
Pursuant to Sections 301(b) and (c), 
the U.S. Trade Representative has 
determined that responsive action is 
appropriate and that appropriate 
responsive action includes taking tariff 
action now on semiconductors from 
China, with an initial tariff level of 0 
percent, increasing in 18 months on 
June 23, 2027, to a rate to be announced 
not fewer than 30 days prior to that 
date. These new Section 301 tariffs 
would be additional to the existing 50 
percent Section 301 tariff on 
semiconductors from China imposed 
pursuant to the Section 301 
investigation related to forced 
technology transfer. The U.S. Trade 
Representative will continue to monitor 
the efficacy of this action, the progress 
made toward resolution of this matter, 
and the need for any additional action. 
This action applies to the following 8- 
digit subheadings:

and burden or restrict U.S. commerce, 
and are thus actionable under sections 
301(b) and 304(a) of the Trade Act (19 
U.S.C. 2411(b) and 2414(a)). See 90 FR 48511 (October 23, 2025) (October 23 
notice). 
In the October 23 notice, the U.S. 
Trade Representative proposed a range 
of actions including the suspension, 
withdrawal, or prevention of 
application of benefits of the Dominican 
Republic-Central America-United States 
Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA–DR) 
benefits to Nicaragua, and additional 
duties of up to 100 percent on some or 
all products of Nicaragua. See 90 FR 48511. USTR requested public 
comments regarding the proposed 
actions and in response received 2,006 
written comments. Commenters 
included representatives from numerous 
manufacturing and agricultural sectors 
as well as a submission from the 
Nicaraguan government.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES60851 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Notices On December 10, 2025, USTR 
announced the U.S. Trade 
Representative’s determination that 
action is appropriate, and that 
appropriate and feasible action in this 
investigation includes the imposition of 
a tariff that is phased-in over two years 
on all imported Nicaraguan goods that 
are not originating under CAFTA–DR. 
See 90 FR 57807 (December 12, 2025) (the December 12 notice). Specifically, 
all imported Nicaraguan goods that are 
not originating under CAFTA–DR will 
be subject to a 15 percent tariff that is 
phased-in, with the tariff set at zero 
percent on January 1, 2026, 10 percent 
on January 1, 2027, and 15 percent on 
January 1, 2028. Pursuant to Section 
305(a) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 
2415(a)(1)), USTR announced that it 
would issue a subsequent notice to 
implement this action. 
II. Implementation of Action 
In order to implement the U.S. Trade 
Representative’s determination, 
subchapter III of chapter 99 of the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States (HTSUS) is modified by 
the Annex of this notice, effective 
January 1, 2026. 
Products of Nicaragua that are 
provided for in the new HTSUS heading 
9903.89.01, as established by the Annex 
of this notice, shall continue to be 
subject to antidumping, countervailing, 
or other duties, fees, exactions and 
charges that apply to such products. 
Any product covered by the Annex to 
this notice, except any product that is 
eligible for admission under ‘domestic 
status,’ as defined in 19 CFR 146.43, 
which is subject to the additional duty 
imposed by this determination, and is 
admitted into a U.S. foreign trade zone 
on or after the effective date of the 
additional duties, only may be admitted 
as ‘privileged foreign status,’ as defined 
in 19 CFR 146.41. Such products will be 
subject upon entry for consumption to 
any ad valorem rates of duty or quantitative limitations related to the 
classification under the applicable 
HTSUS subheading. 
As provided in the December 12 
notice, the U.S. Trade Representative 
will continue to monitor the effects of 
the trade action and the progress made 
toward resolution of this matter. 
Additionally, the U.S. Trade 
Representative will continue to examine 
the efficacy of these actions. If it is 
determined that additional leverage is 
needed to encourage Nicaragua to 
eliminate the investigated acts, policies, 
and practices, the U.S. Trade 
Representative will consider taking 
additional action. 
Annex 
A. Effective with respect to articles of 
Nicaragua entered for consumption, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. 
eastern time on January 1, 2026, 
subchapter III of chapter 99 of the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States (HTSUS) is modified: 
1. by inserting new heading 
9903.89.01 in numerical sequence, with 
the material in the new heading inserted 
in the columns of the HTSUS labeled 
‘‘Heading/Subheading’’, ‘‘Article 
Description’’, ‘‘Rates of Duty 1-General’’, 
‘‘Rates of Duty 1-Special’’ and ‘‘Rates of 
Duty 2’’, respectively:

No change’’. .................
2. by inserting new additional U.S. 
note 29 in numerical sequence: 
‘‘29. (a) Heading 9903.89.01 imposes 
additional duties on imports of articles 
the product of Nicaragua, as provided in 
this note. The additional duties apply to 
products of Nicaragua that are subject to 
the rates of duty provided for in column 
1-general. The additional duties do not 
apply to originating goods of Nicaragua 
under the Dominican Republic-Central 
America-United States Free Trade 
Agreement (CAFTA–DR), as defined in 
general note 29 to the HTSUS. 
Notwithstanding U.S. note 1 to 
subchapter III of chapter 99 of the 
HTSUS, the articles of Nicaragua that 
are subject to the additional duties 
imposed by heading 9903.89.01 shall 
also be subject to the additional duties 
imposed on articles the product of 
Nicaragua by heading 9903.02.47. 
The additional duties imposed by 
heading 9903.89.01 do not apply to 
goods for which entry is properly 
claimed under a provision of chapter 98 
of the HTSUS, except for goods entered 
under subheadings 9802.00.40, 
9802.00.50, and 9802.00.60, and 
heading 9802.00.80. For subheadings 
9802.00.40, 9802.00.50, and 9802.00.60, 
the additional duties apply to the value 
of repairs, alterations, or processing 
performed abroad, as described in the 
applicable subheading. For heading 
9802.00.80, the additional duties apply 
to the value of the article less the cost 
or value of such products of the United 
States, as described in heading 
9802.00.80. 
Products of Nicaragua that are 
provided for in heading 9903.89.01 shall 
continue to be subject to antidumping, 
countervailing, or other duties, fees, 
exactions and charges that apply to such 
products. 
(b) The additional rates of duty that 
apply to articles the product of 
Nicaragua under column 1-general of 
heading 9903.89.01 shall be phased-in 
as follows: 
If entered during the period from 
January 1, 2026, though December 31, 
2026, . . . 0% 
If entered during the period from 
January 1, 2027, though December 31, 
2027, . . . 10% 
If entered on or after January 1, 2028,

B. Effective with respect to articles of 
Nicaragua entered for consumption, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. 
eastern time on January 1, 2027, the rate 
of duty 1-general column of heading 
9903.89.01 is modified by deleting 
‘‘0%’’ and by inserting ‘‘10%’’ in lieu 
thereof. 
C. Effective with respect to articles of 
Nicaragua entered for consumption, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. 
eastern time on January 1, 2028, the rate 
of duty 1-general column of heading 
9903.89.01 is modified by deleting 
‘‘10%’’ and by inserting ‘‘15%’’ in lieu 
thereof.

Public Comments Invited: You are 
asked to comment on any aspect of this 
information collection, including (a) 
Whether the proposed collection of 
information is necessary for FAA’s 
performance; (b) the accuracy of the 
estimated burden; (c) ways for FAA to 
enhance the quality, utility and clarity 
of the information collection; and (d) 
ways that the burden could be 
minimized without reducing the quality 
of the collected information. The agency 
will summarize and/or include your 
comments in the request for OMB’s 
clearance of this information collection. 
OMB Control Number: 2120–XXXX. 
Title: Designated Pilot Examiners: Post-Activity Survey. 
Form Numbers: N/A. 
Type of Review: This is a new 
information collection request. 
Background: The FAA delegates pilot- examination authority to qualified 
private citizens in accordance with 
section 183.23 of title 14, Code of 
Federal Regulations. In Section 833 of 
the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, 
Congress mandated that the FAA 
enhance its oversight of designated pilot 
examiners (DPEs) by, among other 
things, ‘‘[d]eploying a survey system to 
track the performance and merit of such 
examiners.’’ Because such a survey will 
necessarily constitute a time burden on 
pilots, the FAA is seeking OMB 
approval to collect pilots’ feedback 
through such a survey system. 
The FAA will ask pilots to complete 
a survey following practical 
examinations conducted by DPEs. The 
survey will consist of approximately 
twelve yes-or-no questions regarding 
DPEs’ level of professionalism; the 
suitability of the exam environment; the 
content of the exam; and the duration of 
the ground portion and the flight 
portion of the exam. The FAA will use 
the information collected to track the 
performance and merit of DPEs.

on September 22, 2025 (90 FR 45459). 
The Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA), through the Office of Aerospace 
Medicine (OAM), is responsible for the 
medical certification of pilots and 
certain other personnel under 14 CFR 
part 67 to ensure they are medically 
qualified to operate aircraft and perform 
their duties safely. In the 
accomplishment of this responsibility, 
OAM provides a number of services to 
pilots and has established goals for the 
performance of those services. This is a 
biennial survey designed to meet the 
requirement to survey stakeholder 
satisfaction under Executive Order No. 
12862, ‘‘Setting Customer Service 
Standards,’’ and the Government 
Performance and Results Act of 1993 
(GPRA). 
The survey of Airman Satisfaction 
with Aeromedical Certification Services 
assesses airman opinion of key 
dimensions of service quality. These 
dimensions, identified by the OMB 
Statistical Policy Office in the 1993 
‘‘Resource Manual for Customer 
Surveys,’’ are courtesy, competence, 
reliability, and communication. The 
survey also provides airmen with the 
opportunity to provide feedback on the 
services and a medical certificate 
application tool they use. This 
information is used to inform 
improvements in Aeromedical 
Certification Services. 
The survey was initially collected in 
2004 and collected approximately every 
2 years, most recently in 2023 (OMB 
Control No. 2120–0707). Across 
collections, minor revisions have been 
made to the survey items and response 
options to reflect changes in operational 
services and survey technology. To 
reduce the burden on the individual 
respondent and potentially improve the 
response rate, this information 
collection will be electronic. 
Respondents: Approximately 5,700 Airmen who have sought a medical 
certification within two years of the 
survey administration. 
Frequency: Every two years. Estimated Average Burden per 
Response: 15 minutes. Estimated Total Annual Burden: 
1,425 total burden hours.

December 22, 2025.

DOT is required to publish this notice 
in the Federal Register in accordance 
with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995. 
DATES: Interested persons are invited to submit comments on or before January 
28, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: DOT invites interested persons to submit comments identified 
by Docket No. DOT–OST–2025–1921 
through one of the following methods: 
€Federal eRulemaking Portal: http:// www.regulations.gov. Follow the instructions on the site. This website

Instructions: All items submitted must cite the OMB control numbers (see 
abstracts below). 
Note: Comments received generally will be posted without change to https://

20590, telephone: (202) 366–2267 or 
lawanda.morton-chunn@dot.gov. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: DOT invites comments on: (1) whether the 
proposed collection of information is 
necessary for the proper performance of 
the functions of DOT acquisitions, 
including whether the information will 
have practical utility; (2) the accuracy of 
the estimate of the burden of the 
proposed information collection; (3) 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and 
clarity of the information to be 
collected; and (4) ways to minimize the 
burden of the information collection on 
respondents, including the use of 
automated collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology. 
OMB has approved this information 
collection for use through December 31, 
2025. DOT proposes that OMB extend 
its approval for use for three additional 
years beyond the current expiration 
date. On October 27, 2025, OST 
published a 60-day notice in the Federal 
Register soliciting comment by December 26, 2025 on the ICRs for 
which it is now seeking OMB approval 
for the extension of a previously 
approved collection. See 90 FR 48600. OST received no comments in response 
to this 60-day notice. 
Before OMB decides whether to 
approve the proposed collection of 
information, it must provide 30 days for 
public comment. Federal law requires 
OMB to approve or disapprove 
paperwork packages between 30 and 60 
days after the 30-day notice is 
published. 44 U.S.C. 3507(b)–(c); 5 CFR 
1320.12(d); see also 60 FR 44978, 44983, 
Aug. 29, 1995. OMB believes the 30 day 
notice informs the regulated community 
to file relevant comments and affords 
the agency adequate time to digest 
public comments before it renders a 
decision. 60 FR 44983, Aug. 29, 1995. 
Therefore, respondents should submit 
their respective comments to OMB 
within 30 days of publication to best 
ensure having their full effect. 
Need for Extension 
As a result of the Revolutionary 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 
(RFO) Initiative, the Transportation 
Acquisition Regulation (TAR) is also 
under review. The TAR must align with 
on-going interim class deviations to the 
FAR issued by DOT, as well as a later 
planned FAR proposed rule to be 
published in the Federal Register by the 
FAR Council for public comment in 
2026. As a part of its review, DOT will 
consider revising and removing content 
where needed, adding agency-level 
statutory requirements, as required, and 
revising subpart and section numbering 
in each TAR part to align with new FAR 
parts. To implement this initiative and 
to comply with Executive Order 14275 
of April 15, 2025, ‘‘Restoring Common 
Sense to Federal Procurement,’’ and 
OMB Memorandum M–25–26, 
‘‘Overhauling the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation,’’ May 2, 2025, DOT is 
conducting a concurrent rigorous review 
of the TAR to streamline and update 
coverage, where appropriate or to 
remove content to internal agency 
procedures. DOT anticipates there may 
be substantive revisions to the TAR, 
revisions to current Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) solicitation 
provisions and contract clauses under 
Title 48, CFR chapter 12 (the TAR), part 
1252. This may include potential 
reductions in information collection 
requirements and burden under this 
approved OMB control number. This 
review and update will be worked by 
OSPE in conjunction with the Office of 
Information Technology after 
appropriate benchmarking and analysis 
of statutory and other requirements. 
DOT requires an extension of the 
current information collection 
requirements currently in the TAR at 48 
CFR chapter 12 until this analysis is 
completed, and a proposed TAR rule is 
developed and published in the Federal 
Register for public comment, anticipated later in 2026.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), Federal 
agencies must obtain approval from the 
OMB for each collection of information 
that they conduct or sponsor. 
‘‘Collection of information’’ is defined 
in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 
1320.3(c) to include agency requests or 
requirements imposed on ten or more 
persons, that members of the public 
submit reports, keep records, or provide 
information to a third party. Section 
3506(c)(2)(A) of title 44 generally 
requires Federal agencies to provide a 
60-day notice in the Federal Register 
concerning each proposed collection of 
information, including each proposed 
extension of an existing collection of 
information, before submitting the 
collection to OMB for approval. To 
comply with this requirement, the OCC 
is publishing notice of the renewal of 
this collection.

€12 CFR 163.76(c) (offers and sales of securities of a Federal savings 
association or its affiliates in any office 
of the savings association—form of 
certification). 
Federal savings associations use the 
reports and records that the regulations 
require for internal management control 
purposes, and examiners use them to 
determine whether savings associations 
are being operated safely, soundly, and 
in compliance with regulations. Without 
these reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements, it would be difficult for 
institutions to establish prudent internal 
controls and would limit the ability of 
examiners to determine the accurate 
performance and condition of Federal 
savings associations.

information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the 
OCC, including whether the information

comply with applicable requirements, restrictions,

other privacy and confidentiality laws that govern

such PII. 
Title: Generic Clearance for the Collection of Qualitative Feedback on 
Agency Service Delivery. 
OMB Control No.: 1557–0248. 
Type of Review: Regular. 
Affected Public: Businesses or 
individuals. 
Description: This generic information collection request (ICR) provides the 
OCC with a means to solicit qualitative 
stakeholder feedback in an efficient, 
timely manner, in accordance with the 
Federal government’s commitment to 
improving service delivery. Qualitative 
feedback is information that provides 
useful insights on perceptions and 
opinions but does not include statistical 
survey or quantitative results that can be 
attributed to the surveyed population. 
This qualitative feedback provides 
insights into stakeholder perceptions, 
experiences, and expectations; provides 
an early warning of issues with service; 
and/or focuses attention on areas where 
communication, training, or changes in 
operations might improve delivery of 
products or services. It also enables 
ongoing, collaborative, and actionable 
communications between the OCC and 
its stakeholders, while also utilizing 
feedback to improve program 
management. 
The OCC’s solicitations for feedback 
target areas such as timeliness, 
appropriateness, accuracy of 
information, courtesy, efficiency of 
service delivery, and resolution of 
issues related to service delivery. The 
OCC uses the responses to inform and 
plan efforts to improve or maintain the 
quality of service offered to the public. 
If the OCC does not collect this 
information, it will not have access to 
vital feedback from stakeholders. 
Under this generic ICR, the OCC will 
submit a specific information collection 
for approval only if the collection meets 
the following conditions: 
€It is voluntary; €It imposes a low burden on respondents (based on considerations of 
total burden hours, total number of 
respondents, or burden-hours per 
respondent) and a low cost on both 
respondents and the Federal 
government; 
€It is non-controversial and does not raise issues of concern to other Federal 
agencies; 
€It is targeted to solicit opinions from respondents who have experience 
with the program or will have 
experience with the program in the near 
future; 
€It includes personally identifiable information (PII) only to the extent 
necessary, and the OCC does not retain 
the PII;
1
 
€It gathers information intended to be used internally only for general 
service improvement and program 
management purposes and is not 
intended for release outside of the OCC; 
€It does not gather information to be used for the purpose of substantially 
informing influential policy decisions; 
€It gathers information that will yield qualitative information and will 
not be designed or expected to yield 
statistically reliable results or used to 
reach general conclusions about the 
surveyed population; and 
€Feedback collected provides useful information but does not yield data that 
can be attributed to the overall 
population. 
If these conditions are not met, the 
OCC will submit an information 
collection request to OMB for approval 
through the normal PRA process. 
The OCC will not use this type of 
generic clearance for the collection of 
qualitative feedback for any quantitative 
information collection. 
As a general matter, these information 
collections will not result in any new 
system of records containing privacy 
information and will not ask questions 
of a sensitive nature.

Weighted Selection Process for

File Cap-Subject H–1B Petitions 
AGENCY: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, DHS. 
ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is amending 
its regulations governing the process by 
which U.S. Citizenship and Immigration 
Services (USCIS) selects H–1B 
registrations for unique beneficiaries for 
filing of H–1B cap-subject petitions (or 
H–1B petitions for any year in which 
the registration requirement is 
suspended). Through this rule, DHS is 
implementing a weighted selection 
process that will generally favor the 
allocation of H–1B visas to higher- 
skilled and higher-paid aliens, while 
maintaining the opportunity for 
employers to secure H–1B workers at all 
wage levels, to better serve the 
congressional intent for the H–1B 
program. This rule will be effective in 
time for the FY 2027 registration season. 
DATES: This final rule is effective February 27, 2026.

I. Executive Summary 
DHS is amending its regulations 
governing the H–1B cap selection 
process. This final rule implements a 
weighted selection process that will 
generally favor the allocation of H–1B 
visas to higher-skilled and higher-paid 
aliens, while maintaining the 
opportunity for employers to secure H– 
1B workers at all wage levels. This final 
rule follows a notice of proposed 
rulemaking (NPRM) issued on this topic 
on September 24, 2025, ‘‘Weighted 
Selection Process for Registrants and 
Petitioners Seeking to File Cap-Subject 
H–1B Petitions,’’ 90 FR 45986 (Sept. 24, 
2025). 
A. Purpose and Summary of the 
Regulatory Action 
The purpose of this rule is to allow 
DHS to implement the numerical cap in 
a way that incentivizes employers to 
offer higher wages, or to petition for 
positions requiring higher skills and 
higher-skilled aliens, that are 
commensurate with higher wage levels. 
This weighted selection process will 
generally favor the allocation of H–1B 
visas to higher-skilled and higher-paid 
aliens, while maintaining the 
opportunity for employers to secure H– 
1B workers at all wage levels, to better 
serve the congressional intent for the H– 
1B program. Moreover, it will 
disincentivize abuse of the H–1B 
program to fill relatively lower-paid, 
lower-skilled positions, which is a 
significant problem under the present 
H–1B program. 
Through this rule, DHS is amending 
the process by which USCIS selects H– 
1B registrations for unique beneficiaries 
for filing of H–1B cap-subject petitions 
(or H–1B petitions for any year in which 
the registration requirement is 
suspended) to implement a weighted 
selection process generally based on 
each beneficiary’s equivalent wage 
level. When random selection is 
required because USCIS receives more 
registrations (or petitions) than USCIS 
projects to be needed to meet the 
numerical allocations, USCIS will 
conduct a weighted selection among the 
registrations for unique beneficiaries (or 
petitions) received generally based on 
the highest Occupational Employment 
and Wage Statistics (OEWS) wage level 
that the beneficiary’s proffered wage 
will equal or exceed for the relevant 
Standard Occupational Classification 
(SOC) code in the area(s) of intended 
employment. Under this process, 
registrations for unique beneficiaries or 
petitions will be assigned to the relevant 
OEWS wage level and entered into the 
selection pool as follows: registrations 
for unique beneficiaries or petitions 
assigned wage level IV will be entered 
into the selection pool four times, those 
assigned wage level III will be entered 
into the selection pool three times, those 
assigned wage level II would be entered 
into the selection pool two times, and 
those assigned wage level I will be 
entered into the selection pool one time. 
Each unique beneficiary will only be 
counted once toward the numerical 
allocation projections, regardless of how 
many registrations were submitted for 
that beneficiary or how many times the 
beneficiary is entered in the selection 
pool. 
As noted in the NPRM, although DHS 
is not codifying a severability clause in 
the regulatory text, DHS intends for the 
provisions of this rule to be severable 
from one another as well as severable 
from the registration requirement more 
broadly and the beneficiary-centric 
selection methodology. The absence of 
codified severability language is solely 
to avoid potential confusion within 8 
CFR 214.2, which governs a wide range 
of nonimmigrant classifications beyond 
the H–1B program and already contains 
multiple other severability provisions.

Although several provisions of the INA 
discussed in this final rule refer exclusively to the 
‘‘Attorney General,’’ such provisions are now to be 
read as referring to the Secretary of Homeland 
Security by operation of the HSA. See 6 U.S.C. 202(3), 251, 271(b), 542 note, 552(d), 557; 8 U.S.C. 
1103(a)(1), (g), 1551 note; Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. 392, 397 n.2 (2019); see also 6 U.S.C. 522 (‘‘Nothing 
in this chapter, any amendment made by this 
chapter, or in section 1103 of Title 8, shall be 
construed to limit judicial deference to regulations, 
adjudications, interpretations, orders, decisions, 
judgments, or any other actions of the Secretary of 
Homeland Security or the Attorney General.’’). 
2
Section 102(e) of the HSA, 6 U.S.C. 112(e), 
provides that ‘‘the issuance of regulations by the 
Secretary shall be governed by the provisions of 
chapter 5 of title 5, except as specifically provided 
in this chapter, in laws granting regulatory 
authorities that are transferred by this chapter, and 
in laws enacted after November 25, 2002.’’

Exempt petitions are petitions for (1) 
employment (or an offer of employment) at an 
institution of higher education or a related affiliated 
nonprofit entity, (2) employment (or an offer of 
employment) at a nonprofit research organization or 
a government research organization, or (3) H–1B 
workers who have earned a qualifying U.S. master’s 
degree or higher degree. Also exempt are those 
petitions for beneficiaries who have previously 
been counted under the cap, unless eligible for a 
full 6-years of authorized admission when the 
petition is filed, and who seek to change jobs or 
extend their stay during their 6-year period of 
authorized admission, and those exempt from the

C. No Changes From the Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking 
Following consideration of all public 
comments received on the NPRM, DHS 
is issuing this final rule as proposed in 
the NPRM, without modifications to the 
regulatory text. 
D. Implementation 
This rule will be effective in time for 
the FY 2027 registration season. The 
changes in this final rule will apply to 
all registrations (or petitions, in the 
event that registration is suspended), 
including those for the advanced degree 
exemption, submitted on or after the 
effective date of the final rule. The 
treatment of registrations and petitions 
filed prior to the effective date of this 
final rule will be based on the regulatory 
requirements in place at the time the 
registration or petition, as applicable, is 
properly submitted. DHS has 
determined that this manner of 
implementation best balances 
operational considerations with fairness 
to the public. 
II. Background 
A. Legal Authority 
The Secretary of Homeland Security 
(Secretary)’s authority for these 
regulatory amendments is found in 
various sections of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act (INA or the Act), 8 
U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and the Homeland 
Security Act of 2002 (HSA), Public Law 
107–296, 116 Stat. 2135, 6 U.S.C. 101 et 
seq. General authority for issuing this final rule is found in section 103(a) of 
the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1103(a), which 
authorizes the Secretary to administer 
and enforce the immigration and 
nationality laws and establish such 
regulations as the Secretary deems 
necessary for carrying out such 
authority, as well as section 102 of the 
HSA, 6 U.S.C. 112, which vests all of 
the functions of DHS in the Secretary 
and authorizes the Secretary to issue 
regulations.
1
Further authority for these 
regulatory amendments is found in: 
€Section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), 
which establishes the H–1B 
nonimmigrant classification;

including nonimmigrants described at 
section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of the INA, 8 
U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), as well as 
the form of the petition and the 
information that an importing employer 
must provide in the petition; 
€Section 214(g) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1184(g), which, inter alia, prescribes the 
H–1B numerical limitations, various 
exceptions to those limitations, and the 
period of authorized admission for H– 
1B nonimmigrants; 
€Section 214(i) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1184(i), which sets forth the definition 
and requirements of a ‘‘specialty 
occupation’’; 
€Section 235(d)(3) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1225(d)(3), which authorizes 
‘‘any immigration officer . . . to 
administer oaths and to take and 
consider evidence of or from any person 
touching the privilege of any alien or 
person he believes or suspects to be an 
alien to enter, reenter, transit through, 
or reside in the United States or 
concerning any matter which is material 
and relevant to the enforcement of [the 
INA] and the administration of [DHS]’’; 
€Section 287(b) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1357(b), which authorizes the taking 
and consideration of evidence 
‘‘concerning any matter which is 
material or relevant to the enforcement 
of [the INA] and the administration of 
[DHS]’’; 
€Section 101(b)(1)(F) of the HSA, 6 U.S.C. 111(b)(1)(F), which provides that 
a primary mission of DHS is to ‘‘ensure 
that the overall economic security of the 
United States is not diminished by 
efforts, activities, and programs aimed at 
securing the homeland’’; 
€Section 402 of the HSA, 6 U.S.C. 202, which charges the Secretary with 
‘‘[e]stablishing and administering rules
2
 
. . . governing the granting of visas or 
other forms of permission . . . to enter 
the United States’’ and ‘‘[e]stablishing 
national immigration enforcement 
policies and priorities’’; see also HSA 
sec. 428, 6 U.S.C. 236; and 
€Section 451(a)(3) and (b) of the HSA, 6 U.S.C. 271(a)(3) and (b), 
transferring to USCIS the authority to 
adjudicate petitions for nonimmigrant 
status, establish policies for performing 
that function, and set national 
immigration services policies and 
priorities. 
B. Background on H–1B Registration 
The H–1B visa program allows U.S. 
employers to temporarily hire foreign 
workers to perform services in a 
specialty occupation, services related to 
a U.S. Department of War (DOW) 
cooperative research and development 
project or coproduction project, or 
services of distinguished merit and 
ability in the field of fashion modeling. 
See INA sec. 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b); Immigration Act of 
1990, Public Law 101–649, sec. 
222(a)(2), 104 Stat. 4978 (Nov. 29, 1990); 
8 CFR 214.2(h). A specialty occupation 
is defined as an occupation that requires 
the (1) theoretical and practical 
application of a body of highly 
specialized knowledge, and (2) 
attainment of a bachelor’s or higher 
degree in the specific specialty (or its 
equivalent) as a minimum qualification 
for entry into the occupation in the 
United States. See INA sec. 214(i)(l), 8 U.S.C. 1184(i)(l). 
Congress has established limits on the 
number of foreign workers who may be 
granted initial H–1B nonimmigrant 
visas or status each fiscal year (FY) 
(commonly known as the ‘‘cap’’). See 
INA sec. 214(g), 8 U.S.C. 1184(g). The 
total number of foreign workers who 
may be granted initial H–1B 
nonimmigrant status during any fiscal 
year may not exceed 65,000. See INA sec. 214(g)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(1)(A). 
Certain petitions are exempt from the 
65,000 numerical limitation.

remanded the matter to DHS and DHS subsequently 
withdrew the rule. On December 22, 2021, DHS

exemption from the 65,000 cap for H– 
1B workers who have earned a 
qualifying U.S. master’s or higher degree 
may not exceed 20,000 foreign workers. 
See INA sec. 214(g)(5)(C), 8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(5)(C). 
To manage the annual cap, USCIS 
used a random selection process in 
years of high demand to determine 
which petitions were selected toward 
the projected number of petitions 
needed to reach the annual H–1B 
numerical allocations. In order to better 
manage the selection process, DHS 
created a registration requirement for H– 
1B cap-subject petitions, which was first 
implemented in 2020 for the FY 2021 
cap season. Through issuance of a final 
rule in 2019, ‘‘Registration Requirement 
for Petitioners Seeking To File H–1B 
Petitions on Behalf of Cap-Subject 
Aliens,’’ DHS developed a new way to 
administer the H–1B cap selection 
process to streamline processing and 
provide overall cost savings to 
employers seeking to file H–1B cap- 
subject petitions. See 84 FR 888 (Jan. 31, 2019). Under the current registration 
process, prospective petitioners (also 
known as registrants) that seek to 
employ H–1B cap-subject workers must 
first submit a registration for each 
requested worker. The H–1B selection 
process is then run on properly 
submitted electronic registrations. Only 
those with valid selected registrations 
are eligible to file H–1B cap-subject 
petitions. 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(1). 
In February 2024, DHS implemented 
a beneficiary-centric selection process 
for H–1B registrations to better ensure 
each beneficiary will have the same 
chance of being selected, regardless of 
the number of registrations submitted 
on his or her behalf, among other 
integrity measures. 89 FR 7456 (Feb. 2, 
2024). Under this beneficiary-centric 
selection process, registrations are 
counted based on the number of unique 
beneficiaries who are registered. 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(4). Each unique 
beneficiary is counted once toward the 
random selection, regardless of how 
many registrations are submitted for that 
beneficiary. Id. A prospective petitioner whose registration is selected is eligible 
to file an H–1B cap-subject petition 
based on the selected registration during 
the associated filing period. 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(1). 
C. Need for Regulatory Reform 
Congress provided DHS with the 
authority to better ensure a fair, orderly, 
and efficient allocation of H–1B cap 
numbers based on reasoned decision 
making, including consideration of the 
overall statutory scheme and purpose of 
the classification: the selection of highly 
skilled and highly paid nonimmigrants 
in the United States while protecting the 
wages, working conditions, and job 
opportunities of U.S. workers. 
Congressional intent behind creating the 
H–1B program was, in part, to help U.S. 
employers fill labor shortages in 
positions requiring highly skilled or 
highly educated workers.
4
A key goal of 
the program at its inception was to help 
U.S. employers obtain the temporary 
employees they need to meet their 
business needs to remain competitive in 
the global economy.
5
To address 
legitimate countervailing concerns of 
the adverse impact foreign workers 
could have on U.S. workers, Congress 
enacted a number of measures intended 
to protect U.S. workers, including the 
annual numerical limitations. Congress 
was concerned that a surplus of foreign 
labor could depress wages for all 
workers in the long run and recognized 
the cap as a means of ‘‘continuous 
monitoring of all admissions.’’
6
 
As noted above, USCIS has used a 
random selection process in years of 
high demand to determine which 
registrations (or petitions, as applicable) 
are selected toward the projected 
number needed to reach the annual H– 
1B numerical allocations. While the 
current random selection of petitions or 
registrations is reasonable, DHS believes 
it is neither the optimal, nor the 
exclusive method of selecting 
registrations or petitions toward the 
numerical allocations when more 
registrations or petitions, as applicable, 
are simultaneously submitted than 
projected as needed to reach the 
numerical allocations. Pure 
randomization does not serve the ends 
of the H–1B program or congressional 
intent to help U.S. employers fill labor 
shortages in positions requiring highly 
skilled workers.
7
 
DHS believes a better reasoned policy, 
consistent with the intent of the H–1B 
statutory scheme, is to utilize the 
numerical cap in a way that incentivizes 
a U.S. employer’s recruitment of 
beneficiaries for positions requiring the 
highest skill levels within the visa 
classification or otherwise earning the 
highest wages in an occupational 
classification and area of intended 
employment, which generally correlate 
with higher skill levels. Put simply, 
because demand for H–1B visas has 
exceeded the annual supply for more 
than a decade,
8
DHS prefers that 
simultaneously submitted registrations 
for cap-subject H–1B visas be selected in 
a manner that favors beneficiaries 
earning the highest wages relative to 
their SOC codes and area(s) of intended 
employment. 
While DHS prefers that cap-subject 
H–1B visas be allocated in a manner 
that favors beneficiaries earning the 
highest wages, DHS also recognizes the 
value in maintaining the opportunity for 
employers to secure H–1B workers at all 
wage levels. In this respect, this final 
rule differs from the wage-based 
selection rule that DHS proposed and 
finalized in 2020 and 2021, 
respectively.
9
Although the 2021 H–1B 
Selection Final Rule was subsequently 
vacated
10
and then withdrawn,
11
it 
would have ranked and selected 
registrations generally based on the 
highest equivalent prevailing wage 
level, as opposed to selecting by unique

Throughout this rule DHS uses the term ‘‘U.S. 
workers’’ but notes that the Proclamation uses the 
term ‘‘American workers.’’ DHS considers these 
terms synonymous for purposes of this rule. 
beneficiary and assigning a weight to 
them as in this finalized selection 
process. The 2021 H–1B Selection Final 
Rule was expected to result in the 
likelihood that registrations for level I 
wages would not be selected, as well as 
a reduced likelihood that registrations 
for level II would be selected. 86 FR 
1676, 1724 (Jan. 8, 2021). Although DHS 
believes the selection process finalized 
under the 2021 H–1B Selection Final 
Rule was a reasonable approach to 
facilitate the admission of higher-skilled 
or higher-paid workers, DHS believes 
that rule did not capture the optimal 
approach because it effectively left little 
or no opportunity for the selection of 
lower wage level or entry level workers, 
some of whom may still be highly 
skilled. Unlike the 2021 H–1B Selection 
Final Rule, under this final rule, USCIS 
will assign a weight to—rather than rank 
and select—registrations for each 
unique beneficiary generally based on 
the corresponding OEWS wage level. 
By engaging in a wage-level based 
weighting of registrations for unique 
beneficiaries, DHS will better ensure 
that the H–1B cap selection process 
favors relatively higher-skilled, higher- 
valued, or higher-paid foreign workers 
rather than continuing to allow 
numerically-limited cap numbers to be 
allocated predominantly to workers in 
lower skilled or lower paid positions.
12
 
Ultimately, this final rule will 
incentivize employers to offer higher 
wages or higher skilled positions to H– 
1B workers and disincentivize the 
existing widespread use of the H–1B 
program to fill lower paid or lower 
skilled positions, without effectively 
precluding beneficiaries with lower 
wage levels or entry level positions.
13
 
Facilitating the admission of higher- 
skilled workers ‘‘would benefit the 
economy and increase the United States’ 
competitive edge in attracting the ‘best 
and the brightest’ in the global labor 
market,’’ consistent with the goals of the 
H–1B program.
14
 
This rule is consistent with the 
Presidential Proclamation 10973 of 
September 19, 2025, ‘‘Restriction on 
Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant 
Workers’’ (‘‘H–1B Proclamation’’), 
which directed the Secretary of 
Homeland Security to initiate a 
rulemaking to prioritize the admission 
as nonimmigrants of high-skilled and 
high-paid aliens, consistent with INA 
sections 101, 212, and 214 of the INA, 
8 U.S.C. 1101, 1182, and 1184. 90 FR 
46027 (Sept. 24, 2025). As noted in the 
H–1B Proclamation, the H–1B 
nonimmigrant visa program was created 
to bring highly skilled temporary 
workers into the United States, but the 
program has been deliberately exploited 
to bring in lower-paid, lower-skilled 
workers to the detriment of U.S. 
workers.
15
Further, many employers, 
particularly employers in certain 
sectors, have abused the current H–1B 
framework to artificially suppress 
wages, resulting in a disadvantageous 
labor market for U.S. citizens, while at 
the same time making it more difficult 
to attract and retain the highest skilled 
subset of temporary workers. 
DHS believes that the current random 
selection of registrations (or petitions, as 
applicable) has contributed to the 
systematic abuse of the H–1B program 
as described in the H–1B Proclamation. 
Despite improvements DHS has made 
over the years to improve the integrity 
of the H–1B registration process and the 
H–1B program overall, companies 
continue to exploit the current legal 
framework to obtain a pool of relatively 
low-wage workers that are detrimental 
to U.S. workers’ wages, working 
conditions, and job opportunities. This 
final rule will help reverse this trend 
and help the program meet its original 
goals of attracting highly skilled foreign 
workers while better protecting the 
wages, working conditions, and job 
opportunities of U.S. workers. 
III. Response to Public Comments on 
the Proposed Rule 
In response to the proposed rule, DHS 
received 2,731 comments during the 30- 
day period for public comments on the 
NPRM. DHS received additional 
comments related to the associated 
information collections during the 
remainder of the 60-day period for 
public comments in accordance with 
the Paperwork Reduction Act. 
Commenters included individuals 
(including U.S. workers), companies, 
law firms, professional organizations, 
advocacy groups, nonprofit 
organizations, universities, healthcare 
providers, and trade and business 
associations. Some commenters 
expressed support for the rule or offered 
suggestions for improvement. Some 
expressed general opposition to the rule 
and some offered alternatives. For some 
of the public comments, DHS could not 
ascertain whether the commenter 
supported or opposed the proposed 
rule. 
DHS has reviewed all of the public 
comments received in response to the 
NPRM that were submitted in 
accordance with the instructions 
contained in the NPRM during the 
comment period. In this final rule, DHS 
has responded to public comments 
relevant to the NPRM and has addressed 
the significant issues raised therein. 
DHS’s responses are grouped by subject 
area, with a focus on the most common 
issues and suggestions raised by 
commenters. 
A. Support for the Rule and DHS 
Justifications 
1. General Support for the Rule 
Comment: Multiple commenters expressed general support for the rule. 
Other commenters explained their 
support in general terms that 
mentioned: promoting a more merit- 
based H–1B visa system; expanding 
employment options for U.S. citizens; 
promoting a more highly skilled 
workforce; providing an effective 
mechanism for weighted selection using 
wages across different locations; and

2025). See also Daniel Costa & Ron Hira, Economic

Level (May 4, 2020), https://www.epi.org/ 
publication/h-1b-visas-and-prevailing-wage-levels. 
promoting transparency in selection 
criteria. 
Some commenters said the proposed 
approach would better align with the H– 
1B program’s purpose by attracting top 
global talent and/or supporting 
innovation and economic growth in the 
United States while also reducing wage- 
based exploitation. Commenters 
predicted the new selection process 
would strengthen the U.S. economy and 
enhance the United States’ 
competitiveness. 
Multiple commenters stated that the 
new selection process would improve 
program integrity. Commenters 
generally noted that the wage-based 
selection process would improve both 
the integrity of the registration program 
and the H–1B program overall. Some 
commenters praised DHS’s efforts to 
protect the registration selection process 
against gaming by employers. 
Response: DHS agrees that this rule will improve program integrity and will 
better ensure that the H–1B cap 
selection process favors relatively 
higher-skilled, higher-valued, or higher- 
paid foreign workers, consistent with 
the congressional intent of helping U.S. 
employers hire highly skilled aliens to 
address gaps in the U.S. workforce. DHS 
agrees with the commenters’ statements 
that the weighted selection process 
implemented by this rule will expand 
employment prospects for U.S. citizens, 
support innovation, encourage skill 
development, reduce wage-based 
exploitation, promote integrity and 
transparency, and help to strengthen the 
economy. By facilitating the admission 
of highly skilled, highly paid H–1B 
workers, this rule helps the United 
States attract more highly skilled 
workers in the global labor market, 
ultimately enhancing U.S. 
competitiveness. 
2. Protecting U.S. Workers and Wages 
Comment: Many commenters supported the proposed rule, reasoning 
that it would address concerns about the 
current H–1B program’s harmful effects 
on U.S. workers. Commenters criticized 
the wage undercutting and wage 
suppression allowed by the current H– 
1B cap selection process. Some 
commenters shared their personal 
observations about how they, their 
colleagues, or U.S. workers have been 
harmed by companies that exploit the 
H–1B program to bring in large numbers 
of lower-skilled, lower-paid foreign 
workers. 
Multiple commenters predicted that 
the new H–1B selection process would 
benefit U.S. workers. Commenters 
emphasized that the skill- and wage- 
based selection criteria would promote 
fairness; discourage fraudulent 
practices; encourage prospective 
beneficiaries to pursue higher-paying, 
legitimate employment opportunities; 
and better complement the U.S. labor 
market. Commenters remarked that the 
new system would raise wages to more 
accurately reflect market demand for 
needed skills. Another noted the rise of 
artificial intelligence (AI) and the need 
to protect job opportunities for U.S. 
workers and graduates. Some 
commenters remarked that this rule 
would not only help U.S. citizens, but 
also lawful permanent residents and 
legal immigrant workers whose job 
opportunities have been negatively 
impacted by low-skill, low-wage H–1B 
workers. 
Many commenters predicted that the 
new selection process would encourage 
the hiring of U.S. workers by 
disincentivizing information technology 
(IT) staffing companies from hiring 
cheap, foreign labor. Many commenters 
said they support efforts to reform the 
H–1B registration process and expressed 
concern about IT consulting companies 
that hire lower-skilled, lower-paid 
foreign workers who displace U.S. 
workers. Commenters expressed 
criticism of the way some IT staffing 
companies can misuse or abuse the 
system, whether through loopholes or 
illegal practices. Some commenters 
cited data showing that currently 80% 
of H–1B visas are for workers in wage 
levels I and II, a statistic they tied to 
lower wages in affected industries. 
Response: DHS agrees that this rule will reduce problems with the H–1B 
program, which companies have been 
systematically exploiting to bring in 
large numbers of lower-skilled, lower- 
paid foreign workers to the detriment of 
U.S. workers. In particular, U.S. workers 
in computer-related fields have been 
significantly harmed by the prominent 
manipulation of the H–1B program by 
IT or outsourcing firms.
16
This rule will 
incentivize employers to use the H–1B 
program to primarily fill relatively 
higher-paid, higher-skilled positions to 
supplement, rather than replace, U.S. 
workers. Prioritizing registrations or 
petitions, as applicable, on the basis of 
equivalent wage levels will help restore 
the congressional intent for the program 
of helping U.S. employers fill labor 
shortages in positions requiring highly 
skilled and/or highly educated workers. 
DHS agrees that a decrease in the 
hiring of lower-paid foreign labor will 
encourage U.S. employers to hire 
available and qualified U.S. workers, 
potentially improving the wages, 
working conditions, and job 
opportunities for U.S. workers, 
particularly for certain positions and 
industries that have seen wage 
suppression or stagnation due to lower- 
paid H–1B workers. The weighted 
selection process finalized in this rule is 
expected to result in a marked decrease 
in registrations (or petitions, as 
applicable) being selected for workers 
who will be paid a level I corresponding 
wage, with a greater percentage of total 
selected registrations or petitions being 
for beneficiaries who will be paid a 
level III or level IV corresponding wage. 
DHS also agrees this rule will benefit 
lawful permanent residents and other 
legal immigrant workers who have been 
similarly harmed by lower-paid H–1B 
workers. 
3. Positive Impacts on Entry-Level 
Workers and Recent Graduates 
Comment: Many commenters said that the proposed rule would alleviate 
competition and provide more entry- 
level positions for U.S. workers. Citing 
previously published DHS data 
indicating that the ‘‘number of wage 
level I petitions will decrease by 10,099 
annually,’’ a commenter predicted that 
this decrease would encourage 
petitioners to seek out U.S. workers for 
these entry-level positions. One 
commenter predicted that the new rule 
will positively impact early career 
professionals, both U.S. workers and H– 
1B nonimmigrants, by raising wages. 
Many commenters remarked that this 
rule would help U.S. college students 
and other recent graduates, reasoning 
that the new selection process will help 
increase their chances of gainful 
employment and decrease competition 
against lower-paid foreign workers. 
Commenters also specifically noted that 
the proposed weighted selection process 
would offer some improvements for U.S. 
graduates in science, technology, 
engineering, and math (STEM) fields 
and other U.S. workers who are just 
starting out their IT careers. Some 
commenters noted the significant 
challenges faced by current U.S. 
graduates seeking work in the IT or 
STEM fields and stated that this rule 
would encourage U.S. students to 
pursue STEM training and positions. 
Response: DHS agrees that this rule will help to better protect the wages, 
working conditions, and job 
opportunities of U.S. workers, including 
U.S. college students and recent 
graduates. Employers that might have 
petitioned for cap-subject H–1B workers 
to fill relatively lower-paid, lower-

skilled positions may be incentivized to 
hire available and qualified entry-level 
U.S. workers for those positions as a 
result of this rule. DHS also agrees that 
this rule will offer improvements for 
U.S. students and graduates in STEM 
fields. As stated in the H–1B 
Proclamation, abuse of the H–1B 
program is creating disincentives for 
future U.S. workers to choose STEM 
careers. U.S. college graduates in some 
STEM fields are facing high 
unemployment rates as compared to 
graduates with other majors.

90 FR 
46027 (Sept. 24, 2025). Employers have 
abused the H–1B program to artificially 
suppress wages, resulting in a 
disadvantageous labor market for U.S. 
citizens and other legal workers, 
particularly in STEM fields. Id. 
4. Positive Impacts on International 
Students and New Graduates 
Comment: Several commenters expressed appreciation for the proposed 
rule, stating that it would be greatly 
beneficial to international students and 
graduates from U.S. universities who are 
highly skilled or have job offers at high 
wage levels. These commenters 
expressed frustration at not having been 
selected in several previous H–1B 
registration seasons despite earning 
level IV wages, saying that their chances 
of selection would have been much 
higher had a wage-based selection 
process been in place. A commenter 
similarly noted that a weighted 
selection will be more merit-based and 
favorable to students who invested in a 
U.S. education and have legitimate job 
offers, compared to the current random 
selection process which allows ‘‘many 
fake registrations’’ that ‘‘distort the 
odds.’’ A commenter said the new rule 
would benefit international students 
graduating with master’s degrees and 
Ph.D.’s. 
Response: DHS agrees that this rule will be greatly beneficial to 
international students who are highly 
skilled and have job offers with wages 
that correspond to a higher wage level, 
as the rule will increase their chances of 
being selected in any future H–1B 
lottery relative to their chance in the 
current randomized selection process. 
DHS agrees that this rule could be 
beneficial to aliens who have recently 
completed a master’s or doctoral 
program and are seeking to enter the 
workforce. For these aliens, this rule 
will further increase their chance of 
being selected in the H–1B lottery 
relative to their chance in the current 
randomized selection process, to the 
extent that such aliens secure job offers 
with salaries that correspond to higher 
wage levels. It should also be noted that 
recent graduates with master’s or higher 
degrees from U.S. institutions of higher 
education already benefit from the 
existing advanced degree exemption 
and cap selection order. 
5. Positive Impacts on Companies and 
the Economy 
Comment: Commenters articulated several ways that the proposed rule 
would benefit U.S. companies and the 
economy. For example, a commenter 
expressed support for the proposed rule 
and suggested it would encourage 
companies to hire the most qualified 
person for the job, which in turn helps 
companies succeed and improves the 
country’s economy. Commenters stated 
that foreign professionals earning higher 
wages, in addition to contributing 
directly to innovation, may add more to 
the U.S. economy through gross 
domestic product (GDP), tax revenue, 
innovation output per capita, and 
consumer spending. 
Some commenters mentioned ways 
this rule would help certain types of 
employers. For instance, a few 
commenters stated that the proposed 
rule would help start-ups hire and 
retain aliens with needed skills, while 
the current random selection process 
results in startups losing critical 
employees because most registrations go 
to other companies like consulting 
companies or outsourcing firms. A 
commenter stated that high-wage 
positions typically correspond to roles 
in cutting-edge sectors, such as AI, 
cybersecurity, semiconductor design, 
and advanced manufacturing, and stated 
that this rule would help companies 
attract and retain top global talent in 
these fields. A few commenters said the 
new weighted selection process would 
promote hiring of U.S. workers in 
industries key to national security. 
Another commenter praised the rule for 
supporting U.S. workers and said the 
United States should focus on educating 
and developing doctors from within its 
own population rather than recruiting 
doctors from other countries. 
Response: DHS agrees that the weighted selection process 
implemented by this rule will benefit 
some U.S. companies by facilitating the 
admission of highly skilled, highly paid 
workers, attracting the best and brightest 
in the global labor market. Unlike the 
current random selection process, 
which results in a higher proportion of 
lower wage and lower skilled H–1B 
workers, this rule will benefit 
companies of all types, including 
startups and those in critical sectors, 
that are seeking to hire highly skilled 
workers with wages that correspond to 
a higher wage level. These workers are 
more likely to spur innovation and help 
their employers succeed, ultimately 
benefiting the U.S. economy, whether 
directly through taxes paid, consumer 
spending, and contributions to 
corporate earnings, or indirectly through 
promoting growth in key industries, 
including those related to national 
security. Finally, DHS agrees that the 
new weighted selection process will 
help to better protect the wages, 
working conditions, and job 
opportunities for U.S. workers, 
including those in medicine and health- 
related fields. 
B. Opposition to the Rule and Policy 
Objections 
1. General Opposition to the Rule 
Comment: Some commenters opposed the rule based on general policy 
concerns, stating that the rule would, for 
example, be unfair, produce uncertainty 
for businesses, reduce diversity and 
inclusiveness in the workplace, and 
‘‘undermine[ ] the principles of equal 
opportunity that should guide 
immigration policy.’’ Other commenters 
generally asserted that the rule would 
weaken American competitiveness or 
harm innovation in the United States. 
Other commenters generally described 
the benefits of the H–1B program (e.g., 
that it allows companies to invest in 
domestic facilities, create additional 
jobs for U.S. employees, fill gaps in 
technical and scientific areas where 
shortages exist, and hire foreign workers 
with specialized skills which 
complement those of U.S. workers) and 
claimed that this rule is not needed. 
Response: As discussed in greater detail in response to more specific 
comments later in this preamble, DHS 
disagrees with these commenters that 
the rule will result in the asserted 
harms; moreover, to the extent that 
harm may occur in any individual case, 
DHS believes that on balance, this 
approach is more likely to support the 
purposes of the H–1B program and the 
national interest. In addition, DHS 
disagrees that the rule is not needed, as 
it is well documented that the H–1B 
program has been deliberately and 
systematically exploited. The current

2. Fairness and Equal Opportunity 
Concerns 
Comment: Many commenters expressed concerns about the fairness 
and equity of the proposed weighted 
selection process with some 
commenters saying the rule goes against 
U.S. values of opportunity and fairness. 
Other commenters stated that the 
current random selection process, 
though imperfect, provides all qualified 
applicants with an equal chance 
regardless of employer size, education 
level, or industry. The commenters 
stated that a weighted selection process 
would favor larger corporations, well- 
funded petitioners, and candidates with 
advanced U.S. degrees, unfairly 
disadvantaging skilled workers with 
comparable or greater expertise but 
different academic or geographic 
backgrounds. Another commenter 
remarked that one of the most echoed 
sentiments online is that the wage- 
weighted rule ‘‘only helps the rich get 
richer’’ by linking selection chances to 
salary, which favors those from 
privileged backgrounds and high-paying 
industries. Some commenters stated that 
the proposed rule would create a ‘‘pay- 
to-play’’ system. Another commenter 
stated that it is not fair that people with 
talent but limited resources would be 
ignored because of this proposal, 
questioning when money became the 
main priority over skills and potential. 
Another commenter remarked that 
companies may ‘‘lowball’’ their 
employees in order to control their 
spending on H–1B visas, leading to 
more unfair treatment. Another 
commenter stated that the proposed rule 
would distort fair competition for labor 
and would discourage legitimate 
participation in the H–1B program. 
Response: DHS believes that the ongoing exploitation of the H–1B 
program—to the detriment of U.S. 
workers and legitimate employers and 
job seekers who have been crowded out 
of the program—is contrary to the 
principles of fairness and equal 
opportunity. The current random 
selection process is not fair to U.S. 
workers whose wages may be adversely 
affected by an influx of relatively lower- 
paid H–1B workers, or to U.S. 
employers who have sought to petition 
for foreign workers at higher OEWS 
prevailing wage levels and are not 
selected. Regarding the concern about 
employers ‘‘lowballing’’ their employees 
to control costs on H–1B visas, DHS 
believes that as a result of this rule 
employers may choose to offer a higher 
wage to a prospective beneficiary whose 
skill level they value and who they wish 
to retain. Additionally, this rule may 
offer highly skilled H–1B workers 
greater leverage in negotiating for a 
higher salary, which in turn could 
encourage competition for labor among 
petitioners seeking similarly qualified 
workers. 
DHS does not view the weighted 
selection process as a ‘‘pay-to-play’’ 
system, but rather a process that attracts 
the best and the brightest, increases the 
chance of selection for those who will 
be paid wages at higher corresponding 
wage levels, and disincentives 
petitioning employers from offering 
wages at the lower corresponding wage 
levels. As stated throughout the NPRM, 
DHS believes that salary generally is a 
reasonable proxy for skill level.
18
The 
purpose of this rule is to implement the 
numerical cap in a way that will 
generally favor the allocation of H–1B 
visas to higher-skilled and higher-paid 
aliens, while maintaining the 
opportunity for employers to secure H– 
1B workers at all wage levels. DHS 
believes this approach serves 
congressional intent for the H–1B 
program more faithfully than the current 
random selection process. DHS believes 
that this rule appropriately balances the 
interests of U.S. workers with the 
interests of petitioning employers and 
the alien workers they seek to employ 
as H–1B nonimmigrants. 
Comment: Some commenters expressed concern that the proposed 
weighted selection process would 
complicate the registration selection 
process by creating uncertainty, 
complexity, and unfair bias. The 
commenters said that the weighting 
process would make outcomes harder to 
understand and undermine trust in the 
lottery, compared to the current random 
lottery which is transparent and simple 
to understand. A commenter likewise 
asserted that a ‘‘fundamental flaw’’ with 
the proposed rule’s approach is that it 
retains the elements of uncertainty and 
randomness, such that someone being 
offered a $300,000 salary, for example, 
would have no certainty of winning the 
weighted lottery. Another commenter 
said that the rule adds uncertainty and 
makes workforce planning less 
predictable, thus making the H–1B 
program impractical to use. 
Response: DHS disagrees with these commenters that the weighted selection 
process creates uncertainty and 
unpredictability. To the contrary, this 
rule will increase certainty and 
predictability by increasing the chances 
that a registration for a highly skilled, 
highly paid alien will be selected in the 
selection process. Under the current 
system, the chance that any particular 
beneficiary is selected in the lottery is 
just under 30 percent, regardless of how 
highly skilled that beneficiary may be. 
These low chances of selection increase 
uncertainty for all beneficiaries. In 
contrast, under this final rule the 
chances of selection for a beneficiary 
weighted at a level IV wage will 
increase to over 61 percent and a 
beneficiary weighted at a level III wage 
will increase to over 45 percent. 
While the final rule retains some 
degree of uncertainty because it retains 
an element of randomness, DHS 
believes it is important to retain these 
aspects of the lottery. As stated in the 
NPRM, DHS believes it is optimal to 
increase the chances of selection for 
highly skilled aliens while maintaining 
the opportunity for employers to secure 
H–1B workers at all wage levels. 
DHS disagrees that the weighted 
selection process finalized in this rule 
will complicate the H–1B registration 
selection process or make outcomes 
harder to understand. USCIS is fully 
prepared to implement the weighted 
selection process from an operational 
and technical perspective in time for the 
upcoming H–1B cap season. DHS 
believes that the public has received 
sufficient notice of the weighted 
selection process and that the 
parameters of the process have been 
made clear. 
Finally, DHS disagrees that the 
weighted selection process undermines 
trust in the H–1B cap selection process. 
As previously described, the prevalent 
and systematic abuse of the current H– 
1B program undermines public trust. 
DHS believes that the new weighted 
selection process will restore trust in the 
H–1B program by returning the program 
to its original intended purpose of 
helping U.S. employers fill labor

DHS reviewed the research cited by the 
commenter from the Economic Innovation Group 
and George Mason University entitled, Unintended 
Consequences of Restrictions on H–1B Visas (Jan. 
28, 2021), https://www.mercatus.org/research/ 
policy-briefs/unintended-consequences-restrictions- 
h-1b-visas. 
shortages in positions requiring highly 
skilled or highly educated workers 
while protecting the wages, working 
conditions, and job opportunities of 
U.S. workers, rather than allowing the 
continued abuse of the H–1B program to 
displace and otherwise harm U.S. 
workers. 
3. Negative Impacts on Companies, the 
Workforce, and the Economy 
Comment: Several commenters asserted that H–1B professionals drive 
innovation, productivity growth, and 
entrepreneurship. Some commenters 
addressed the contributions of 
international students to innovation and 
economic growth and said that limiting 
their job opportunities would 
undermine such growth. Other 
commenters specified that startups and 
small businesses are significant drivers 
of innovation and economic growth in 
the United States, and limiting their 
access to international talent could stifle 
such innovation and entrepreneurship. 
Other commenters said that innovation 
and breakthroughs often come from 
early-career professionals, startups, and 
research institutions that typically 
cannot compete with the salaries of 
larger, established companies. Another 
commenter stated that startups rely on 
the H–1B program to attract talented 
workers who possess ‘‘niche expertise,’’ 
and that this rule will make the H–1B 
program more expensive and difficult to 
use, and ultimately limit the growth of 
U.S. tech innovation and global 
leadership. 
Response: DHS disagrees that the rule will stifle innovation, economic growth, 
and global leadership. Rather than 
limiting access to international talent, 
DHS believes that this rule will facilitate 
employers of all types and sizes to 
attract and retain highly skilled and 
highly paid aliens. This rule will help 
the United States to attract the best and 
brightest workers by increasing the 
chance of selection for highly skilled, 
highly paid aliens who are more likely 
to spur innovation and make significant 
contributions to their employers and 
industry, while also better protecting 
the wages, working conditions, and job 
opportunities of U.S. workers. 
Additionally, this rule does not treat 
people who work for startups or small- 
sized entities differently than those who 
work for other larger companies. While 
DHS recognizes that some startups and 
small businesses may operate on smaller 
margins compared to other companies, 
if an employer values a beneficiary’s 
work and the unique qualities the 
beneficiary possesses, the employer 
could offer a higher wage than required 
by the prevailing wage level to reflect 
that value. DHS recognizes that this 
could result in increased costs for a 
business, however, DHS believes that 
the tradeoff of having a greater chance 
to recruit or retain talented employees 
may offset these increased costs. If a 
company is unable to pay an employee 
a higher wage for a greater chance of 
selection, they could then try to find a 
substitute U.S. worker. This rule, by 
weighting selection, allows employers 
seeking workers at any wage level to 
have an opportunity for selection, such 
that they are not precluded from 
participating in the program solely 
because they are unable to pay a wage 
that corresponds to a higher wage level. 
Comment: Commenters claimed that this rule would result in companies 
outsourcing more work overseas, 
directly contrary to the intent of this 
rule. Commenters remarked that 
employers who depend on entry-level 
talent would either cut back on hiring 
or outsource jobs abroad, reducing job 
creation within the United States. Some 
commenters specifically stated that the 
proposed rule would result in IT 
companies replacing onsite H–1B 
workers with lower-paid offshore 
resources, with some commenters 
remarking that this would be an 
additional way to undercut U.S. 
workers’ wages by paying significantly 
lower salaries to offshore employees. A 
manufacturing association stated that in 
industries that cannot meet their labor 
force needs domestically, if companies 
cannot use the H–1B program to address 
shortages, employers may be 
incentivized to move production and 
workforce positions offshore. Another 
commenter noted that their industry 
will be unable to substitute lost global 
talent with U.S. workers who still need 
training and education, meaning that 
changes to the H–1B program will leave 
critical positions unfilled, slowing 
innovation and overall job growth. This 
same commenter went on to state that 
research from the Economic Innovation 
Group and George Mason University 
shows that restrictions on H–1B visas 
drives companies to offshore work or 
expand operations abroad, undermining 
the goal of supporting U.S. workers. 
Response: DHS disagrees that this rule will cause employers to outsource more 
jobs or move operations to other 
countries. While DHS acknowledges 
this rule may impose some costs to 
individual employers, the commenters 
do not address the countervailing 
impact on those employers benefited by 
this rule, including those U.S. 
employers offering level III and IV 
wages that will have higher chances of 
selection, or U.S. employers that have 
historically been squeezed out of the H– 
1B lottery that will likely see an 
increased chance to participate in the 
H–1B program. DHS believes that this 
rule, instead, will facilitate the 
admission of higher-skilled workers, 
which will benefit the economy and 
increase the United States’ competitive 
edge in attracting the best and the 
brightest in the global labor market, 
consistent with the goals of the H–1B 
program. 
DHS is not persuaded that U.S. 
companies would rather incur the time 
and expense to move their operations 
abroad instead of increasing their hiring 
of U.S. workers, particularly for entry 
level positions where U.S. workers have 
been replaced with lower-paid, lower- 
skilled foreign labor. DHS believes that 
U.S. employers are more likely to 
change their hiring practices in the 
United States, rather than offshoring 
work abroad, as evidenced by news 
articles highlighting how more and 
more companies have signaled their 
intent to increase their investment in 
America and hire more U.S. workers 
rather than to rely on foreign workers.
19
 
Likewise, DHS is not persuaded by the 
research cited by a commenter 
concluding that H–1B ‘‘visa restrictions 
lead to offshoring.’’
20
This analysis 
primarily discussed ‘‘visa restrictions’’ 
in terms of companies unable to hire H– 
1B workers due to the statutory 65,000 
visa cap and not because they were not 
selected ‘‘by pure ‘luck’ of the H–1B 
lottery process.’’ However, this rule 
does not restrict the number of H–1B 
visas available under the statutory cap, 
nor does it preclude any company from 
selection in the H–1B cap selection 
process.

would disproportionately benefit from 
this rule, as they are more likely to pay 
higher wages and could exploit the 
proposed rule to their advantage, 
contrary to the intent of this rule. 
Commenters remarked that this 
approach would unfairly favor large, 
established corporations that are able to 
pay higher salaries, including the large 
tech companies that are the 
predominant users of the H–1B 
program, with one commenter claiming 
that this weighted lottery system 
‘‘would exaggerate their dominance of 
the program.’’ A commenter remarked 
that IT companies may end up profiting 
even more under the proposed rule, 
while others said that outsourcing 
companies would be ‘‘rewarded’’ by this 
rule and fill positions in areas of ‘‘less 
critical need.’’ A few commenters 
claimed that the rule will actually 
increase the number of large IT 
outsourcing companies selected in the 
lottery, as these companies generally 
certify at levels II and III. For instance, 
a commenter claimed that ‘‘large IT 
outsourcers would be awarded 7.4 
percent more visas under the proposed 
rule than under current policy’’ while 
other commenters cited an analysis 
indicating that large IT outsourcing 
firms would receive 8 percent more 
visas under the rule. 
In addition to benefitting large 
outsourcing companies, a commenter 
said that the proposed system would 
also benefit other H–1B-dependent 
employers, even though they pay less 
than other companies. The commenter 
explained that large outsourcers and 
other H–1B-dependent employers pay 
less than other H–1B employers, but 
they get certified at higher wage levels 
because they use H–1Bs for workers in 
lower-skilled, lower-paid occupations, 
and provided an analysis to support this 
contention.
21
This analysis indicated 
that the rule would increase the share of 
selected registrations for H–1B 
dependent companies by 4 percent. 
Response: DHS disagrees with the assertion that the weighted selection 
process will disproportionately benefit 
large IT or outsourcing companies and 
H–1B-dependent employers that use the 
H–1B program to fill lower-skilled, 
lower-paid occupations. Under the new 
selection process, registrations or 
petitions for positions with salaries that 
correspond to lower wage levels will 
have a lower chance of selection than 
those with salaries that correspond to 
higher wage levels. This will incentivize 
all H–1B cap-subject employers, 
including outsourcing companies and 
H–1B dependent employers, to offer 
higher wages to increase their chances 
of selection, thereby aligning with the 
program’s goal of prioritizing highly 
skilled and highly paid workers. 
DHS acknowledges the analysis cited 
by some commenters that this rule will 
likely increase the share of selected 
registrations from large IT outsourcers 
and, to a lesser extent, H–1B dependent 
employers. However, this analysis 
appears to misunderstand the nature of 
the weighting process which is 
generally based on the highest wage 
level that the proffered salary would 
equal or exceed and is not based purely 
on Department of Labor (DOL) wage 
levels. For instance, commenters cited 
to a report that says: ‘‘On the surface, 
this seems like a merit-based reform: 
higher wages should mean higher skills. 
In reality, DOL’s Wage Levels are very 
different from actual wages. The Wage 
Level framework was never designed to 
compare wages across occupations 
because it measures relative seniority 
within a job category, not actual pay. 
There are many workers paid at the 
highest DOL Wage Level but making 
below the median American wage, 
while some at the lowest DOL Wage 
Level are among the best-paid in the 
economy.’’
22
This statement does not 
acknowledge that the weighted 
registration process accounts for the 
actual salary proffered by employers, 
which could correspond to a higher 
wage level. For registration purposes, 
the requirements of the position 
corresponding to the DOL wage level 
would only be relevant if OEWS wage 
data is not available. But even if this 
analysis were reliable, DHS reiterates 
that the weighted selection process is 
not intended to treat any companies or 
industries better or worse than others. 
Again, the goal of this rule is to 
implement a weighted selection process 
that would generally favor the allocation 
of H–1B visas to higher-skilled and 
higher-paid aliens, regardless of 
company type or industry. 
Comment: Commenters wrote that the proposed rule would have a negative 
impact on the workforce and U.S. 
economy. Some commenters stated that 
the proposed rule would negatively 
impact the United States’ ability to 
maintain key talent pipelines, asserting 
that entry-level positions are crucial for 
developing the future workforce and 
that removing early-career talent from 
the workforce pipeline would harm 
long-term economic growth. Another 
commenter remarked that the United 
States relies on the contributions of 
global talent for innovation, economic 
growth, and competitiveness. 
A few commenters remarked that new 
or growing companies, which often hire 
foreign talent and would be 
disadvantaged by this rule, create most 
new U.S. jobs. One commenter asserted 
that in the technology industry, each H– 
1B request is associated with an 
increase of approximately five jobs, 
while another said that unemployment 
in technology fields declined from 3.4 
percent to 3 percent over the past year, 
even as the number of H–1B workers 
remained significant. A commenter 
pointed out that studies have shown 
that ‘‘high-skilled immigration causes 
large increases in productivity and 
economic growth in the United States’’ 
and that U.S. firms employing highly 
skilled international graduates are more 
likely to expand business, research, and 
development. Other commenters 
suggested that high-skilled immigration 
generates additional domestic 
employment opportunities, reduces 
unemployment in certain occupations, 
and complements U.S. workers rather 
than replacing them. 
Some commenters stated that by 
making it difficult to hire recent 
graduates, the rules would interfere 
with investment and innovation in 
industries that rely on highly skilled 
entry-level workers to fill critical roles 
that cannot be met by the U.S. labor 
market alone. Similarly, a commenter 
said that limiting access to H–1B visas 
for early-career professionals would 
reduce the flow of new ideas, constrain 
entrepreneurship, and slow wage 
growth in high-productivity sectors. 
Another commenter stated that the 
proposed rule would reduce the 
diversity of specialty occupations in the 
U.S. workforce and weaken innovation. 
A commenter wrote that instead of 
benefiting U.S. workers, the rule would 
‘‘hit entry- and mid-level workers the 
hardest, blocking young Americans’’ 
from certain jobs. 
Response: The goal of this rule is to favor the allocation of H–1B visas to 
higher-skilled and higher-paid aliens. 
DHS believes the weighted selection 
process implemented through this rule 
will best achieve this goal and disagrees 
that this rule will have a net negative 
impact on the workforce and the U.S. 
economy. Instead, DHS believes this 
rule will incentivize employers to 
proffer higher wages, or to petition for 
positions requiring higher skills and 
higher-skilled aliens that are 
commensurate with higher wage levels, 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:36 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\29DER2.SGM 29DER2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260877 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations thereby attracting the best and the 
brightest employees and promoting 
innovation across all industries and 
occupations. DHS further believes that 
increasing the chance of selection for 
higher-skilled, higher-paid aliens will 
encourage competition and better 
protect the wages, working conditions, 
and job opportunities of U.S. workers. 
Regarding the studies and benefits of 
high-skilled immigration mentioned by 
some commenters, DHS acknowledges 
that high-skilled immigration in general 
can be beneficial to companies, the 
workforce, and the economy at large. 
However, these studies and commenters 
do not acknowledge the specific 
problem that this rule addresses, which 
is the abuse of the H–1B program to 
bring in lower-skilled workers in lower- 
paid positions. Further, this rule favors 
the allocation to higher-skilled aliens 
but does not alter the numerical 
limitations, such that higher-skilled 
aliens who are selected and ultimately 
granted H–1B status may still provide 
the general benefits that the commenter 
alludes to, while better protecting the 
wages, working conditions and job 
opportunities of U.S. workers. DHS does 
not agree that the rule will ‘hit entry and 
mid-level U.S. workers the hardest’ or 
‘block young Americans’ from jobs. The 
commenter offers no data connecting 
the weighted selection process to 
reduced job opportunities for U.S. 
workers. The rule does not change the 
number of H–1B cap-subject visas. It 
does not eliminate lower-wage jobs or 
employers’ ability to hire or train entry- 
level workers. Employers must comply 
with statutory and regulatory 
requirements ensuring that H–1B 
workers do not adversely affect the 
wages and working conditions of U.S. 
workers. The purpose of the rule is not 
to raise H–1B wages at the expense of 
U.S. workers. Instead, by improving the 
probability that higher-wage H–1B 
positions are selected, the weighted 
selection process may reduce reliance 
on lower wage filings and can help 
preserve more entry- and mid-level 
employment opportunities for U.S. 
workers. 
Comment: Some commenters remarked that negative impacts to U.S. 
industries would affect U.S. citizens and 
young Americans, stating that: losing 
access to educators would lead to fewer 
learning opportunities for American 
students; fewer international engineers 
would impact mid-sized manufacturers, 
slowing innovation and hurting U.S. 
workers who rely on these jobs; fewer 
international doctors would impact 
healthcare for Americans; 
disadvantaging startups reduces 
opportunities for Americans; 
disadvantaging justice and public 
interest firms that rely on international 
workers could create inequities in the 
justice system, ultimately harming U.S. 
citizens; disadvantaging engineers and 
architects would shut out mid-sized 
construction companies, which would 
slow projects and drive up costs for 
American homeowners; and 
disadvantaging companies involved in 
supply chain operations can increase 
delivery costs and create delays that 
would impact American consumers. 
Another commenter noted that as a U.S. 
citizen, they may see fewer employment 
opportunities if research labs that 
depend on international workers 
downsize because of the proposed rule. 
A commenter claimed that the rule 
would result in costs to the U.S. 
economy in terms of U.S. employers not 
having access to necessary skills, which 
would delay productivity and 
innovation, disrupt delivery of essential 
services to the American public, and 
cause employers to abandon projects or 
move the projects overseas. The 
commenter concluded that these costs 
outweigh the benefits of this rule. 
Response: DHS disagrees with the commenters’ assertions that this rule 
will negatively impact U.S. industries, 
U.S. citizens, and young Americans. As 
explained in the other responses 
throughout this rule, the weighted 
selection process would likely have 
little effect on certain occupations, such 
as professors and doctors, since these 
occupations are usually cap-exempt or 
have other immigration pathways for 
employment in the United States (such 
as J–1 or the Conrad 30 program for 
doctors). Regarding small and mid-size 
companies and startups, these 
employers will be treated the same as all 
other employers and have the option to 
pay any highly sought after beneficiary 
a higher wage for a better chance at 
selection. As for opportunities for U.S. 
citizens, DHS disagrees that they will 
see fewer employment opportunities at 
research labs if these labs are not able 
to hire as many international workers. 
Rather, DHS anticipates that if these 
companies hire fewer international 
workers, they may look to fill such roles 
with U.S. workers, thereby improving 
job prospects for U.S. workers. 
With respect to the commenter’s 
assertion that the asserted economic 
costs of the rule outweigh the benefits, 
DHS disagrees with this commenter. 
The commenter did not provide data to 
support the claimed costs of this rule on 
the U.S. economy. In addition, this 
commenter did not consider the costs to 
U.S. workers who have been displaced 
or denied employment opportunities, or 
whose wages have been suppressed, due 
to the abuse of the H–1B program. 
Incentivizing employers to proffer 
higher wages to aliens seeking H–1B 
status to increase their chance of 
selection would indirectly benefit the 
wages, working conditions, and job 
opportunities of U.S. workers and 
mitigate the claimed costs to the U.S. 
economy that the commenter described. 
Comment: Some commenters warned that the proposed rule would create 
artificial wage inflation, which harms 
U.S. workers. The commenters claimed 
that the rule would encourage 
employers to inflate wages and overpay 
foreign workers compared to U.S. 
workers, creating inequity for U.S. 
workers performing the same work who 
are paid less. 
Response: This rule does not mandate what wages employers must pay their 
employees and does not mandate 
employers to pay more for their H–1B 
workers. Rather, this rule fills in a 
statutory gap regarding how to 
administer the H–1B numerical 
allocations in years of excess demand 
and does so in a manner that will 
incentivize employers to employ highly 
paid, highly skilled workers. Rather 
than overpaying foreign workers as 
compared to U.S. workers, DHS believes 
that U.S. employers that might have 
petitioned for cap-subject H–1B workers 
to fill relatively lower-paid, lower- 
skilled positions may be incentivized to 
hire available and qualified U.S. 
workers for those positions. DHS also 
believes that an employer who offers a 
higher wage than required by the 
prevailing wage level only would do so 
if it was in their economic interest to do 
so based on the beneficiary’s skill level 
and relative value to the employer. 
Comment: Many commenters said that the proposed rule would negatively 
affect the United States’ ability to 
compete for global talent. A commenter 
said that America’s competitors focus 
on attracting young talent and the 
proposed rule would limit the United 
States’ ability to do the same. Several 
commenters stated that the proposed 
rule may cause a ‘‘brain drain’’ or 
‘‘talent migration’’ away from the 
United States, including from certain 
industries. Some commenters expressed 
concern that the proposed rule, when 
viewed alongside other recent 
immigration policy changes, will 
negatively impact U.S. companies’ 
ability to access, retain, and move talent 
needed for global competition, which 
they said will diminish the country’s 
economic security, contrary to DHS’s 
statutory mission under the Homeland 
Security Act. Some commenters said 
that the proposed rule could lead

companies to deprioritize roles in key 
fields, such as STEM and AI research. 
Response: DHS does not agree that this rule will weaken America’s 
competitiveness, harm innovation and 
entrepreneurship, or lead to ‘‘brain 
drain.’’ On the contrary, DHS believes 
this rule will strengthen America’s 
competitiveness and innovation by 
incentivizing and facilitating the 
admission and retention of higher-paid, 
higher-skilled foreign workers, 
including those in key fields, such as 
STEM and AI research. Under this rule, 
U.S. employers will have increased 
access to more talented, higher-paid 
foreign workers, thus increasing 
innovation and productivity for these 
employers and contributing to American 
competitiveness. 
DHS disagrees with the claims that 
this rule will diminish the country’s 
economic security and is contrary to 
DHS’s statutory mission under the 
Homeland Security Act. As already 
discussed earlier in this preamble, the 
large-scale replacement of U.S. workers 
through systemic abuse of the program 
has undermined both the United States’ 
economic and national security. By 
addressing these abuses, this rule 
supports the nation’s economic and 
national security and is consistent with 
DHS’s statutory mission under the 
Homeland Security Act to ‘‘ensure that 
the overall economic security of the 
United States is not diminished by 
efforts, activities, and programs aimed at 
securing the homeland.’’ HSA sec. 
101(b)(1)(F), 6 U.S.C. 111(b)(1)(F). 
4. Negative Impacts on National 
Security 
Comment: Some commenters expressed opposition to the proposed 
rule on the basis of national security 
and strategic interests. A commenter 
stated that international students 
account for over half of graduate 
enrollments in computer science and 
engineering in U.S. universities, fields 
that directly contribute to advances in 
AI, cybersecurity, biotechnology, and 
semiconductor design—all areas 
identified by the Departments of War 
and Commerce as critical to U.S. 
national security and economic 
resilience. Other commenters stated that 
the proposed rule will undermine the 
global competitiveness of U.S. 
businesses and negatively impact the 
overall economic security of the United 
States. One commenter said that 
international students in key technical 
and scientific fields at U.S. universities 
will be more likely to find post-graduate 
employment outside the United States if 
this rule is passed, noting that 
‘‘competitor countries that recognize the 
value of attracting these highly sought- 
after professionals are strengthening 
their analogous programs.’’ Another 
commenter similarly emphasized the 
importance of retaining foreign students 
that pursue in-demand degrees at U.S. 
universities, asserting that it is in the 
national interest that foreign students 
completing U.S. graduate degrees apply 
their skills to advancing U.S. interests, 
rather than seeking opportunities in 
their home country or another country 
with more flexible early-career 
immigration pathways. 
Response: DHS does not believe this rule will disadvantage prospective 
beneficiaries contributing to 
advancements that strengthen national 
security or innovation in critical sectors, 
and the commenters have not provided 
evidence that this is likely to occur. A 
general correlation between degrees 
obtained by international students and 
fields that contribute to national 
security does not demonstrate that this 
rule will negatively impact critical 
industries or undermine national 
security. Rather, DHS believes this rule 
will incentivize employers to proffer 
higher wages, or to petition for positions 
requiring higher skills and higher- 
skilled aliens that are commensurate 
with higher wage levels, thereby 
attracting the best and the brightest 
employees and promoting 
advancements and innovation across all 
industries, including those that are 
important to national security. 
Further, as noted in the H–1B 
Proclamation, abuses of the H–1B 
program present a national security 
threat by discouraging Americans from 
pursuing careers in science and 
technology, risking American leadership 
in these fields. 90 FR 46027 (Sept. 24, 
2025). This rule will help reverse this 
trend of abuse and help strengthen 
national security. 
5. Negative Impacts on Entry-Level 
Workers and Recent Graduates 
Comment: Many commenters expressed concern that the proposed 
weighted selection process would 
disproportionately disadvantage recent 
graduates and entry-level workers, 
reducing or eliminating their chance of 
selection. One commenter said that the 
proposed weighted selection process 
will penalize early-career, U.S.-educated 
international talent because the wage 
levels measure seniority within an 
occupation and most international 
students are hired at level I or level II 
wages, and provided an analysis to 
support this contention.
23
Commenters 
remarked that most new graduates 
typically start their careers at level I 
wages due to their limited work 
experience, but many soon become 
valuable contributors and leaders and 
the rule would harm these graduates’ 
ability to be employed, undermine the 
‘‘education-to-employment pipeline,’’ 
and harm companies’ ability to attract 
qualified talent in the future. Similarly, 
some commenters remarked that talent 
or value is not always correlated with 
wage level or years of experience, but 
the proposed rule would create a system 
that rewards seniority or wage level 
rather than merit, pushing out the next 
generation of early-career innovators 
and harming the companies that employ 
them. One commenter stated it does not 
make sense to prioritize older, higher- 
paid workers who have fewer years left 
in their career. Commenters also noted 
that international graduates already 
have difficulty securing an entry-level 
role due to lack of U.S. work experience, 
and the proposed rule would present an 
additional challenge that is unfair for 
aliens who had studied in the United 
States legally and would limit career 
opportunities for these aliens. 
Other commenters wrote that entry- 
level positions are important and 
legitimate roles, not examples of 
program abuse, and represent the 
natural starting point for professional 
growth. Commenters reasoned that 
‘‘blocking’’ level I beneficiaries from the 
H–1B program undermines upward 
mobility and creates an artificial barrier 
to career development. Some 
commenters stated that under the 
current system, level I applicants 
already face low selection odds of 
approximately 10–15%, and the 
proposed weighted system would 
reduce these chances to ‘‘nearly zero,’’ 
effectively creating what some described 
as a ‘‘de facto ban’’ on early-career 
professionals. One commenter said that 
the probability of a level I applicant 
being selected would be reduced by 48 
percent, and another commenter said 
the probability of a level I or II applicant 
being selected could decrease to 15 
percent. 
Some commenters stated that while 
their companies’ starting salaries for 
recent graduates are competitive, they 
cannot compare to big corporations that 
can offer high salaries. A commenter 
stated that certain industries generate 
essential public and economic benefits, 
but tend to pay less, which does not 
reflect a lack of skill or potential. 
Commenters said that the emphasis on 
wage-based selection could harm the

nation’s long-term interests, and that the 
U.S. economy benefits from attracting 
and retaining individuals at all career 
levels. Another commenter also 
emphasized that wage level is not 
dispositive of an employee’s 
contribution value and remarked that 
limiting the amount of level I and II 
professionals is not sound economic 
policy and would lead to negative 
impacts greater than any benefit derived 
from higher wages paid to level III and 
IV employees. 
Response: DHS disagrees that this rule would be ‘‘blocking’’ or amount to a ‘‘de 
facto ban’’ on all entry-level workers or 
early-career professionals, or that their 
chances of selection would be ‘‘nearly 
zero.’’ As stated in the NPRM, DHS 
recognizes the value in maintaining the 
opportunity for employers to secure H– 
1B workers at all wage levels. In this 
respect, this rule differs from the 
selection process in the 2021 H–1B 
Selection Final Rule, through which 
USCIS would have ranked and selected 
registrations generally based on the 
highest equivalent OEWS wage level 
that the proffered wage equaled or 
exceeded for the relevant SOC code and 
area(s) of intended employment, 
beginning with level IV and proceeding 
in descending order with levels III, II, 
and I. The 2021 rule was expected to 
result in the likelihood that registrations 
for level I wages would not be selected, 
as well as a reduced likelihood that 
registrations for level II would be 
selected. Conversely, as noted in Table 
13 of the NPRM, DHS projects that 
through the weighted selection process 
implemented by this rule, those with a 
level I registration (or petition, as 
applicable) will have a 15.29-percent 
probability of being selected to file a 
cap-subject petition, and those with a 
level II registration (or petition, as 
applicable) will have an increased 
chance of selection as compared to the 
current random selection process 
(30.58% up from 29.59%, respectively). 
DHS believes commenters’ claims that 
this rule would result in a de facto ban 
or block on early-career professionals 
are inaccurate and overstated. For 
instance, prior to implementation of the 
beneficiary-centric selection process, 
780,884 total registrations for 85,000 
statutorily capped H–1B visas allocated 
randomly in cap fiscal year 2024 
yielded a mere 10.9-percent probability 
that a foreign student educated in the 
United States would ultimately be able 
to obtain an H–1B cap-subject visa.
24
 
DHS acknowledges that, under this 
rule, in years of excess demand, 
relatively lower-paid or lower-skilled 
positions will have a reduced chance of 
selection. However, this rule maintains 
the opportunity for employers to secure 
H–1B workers at all levels, including 
recent graduates or those who are just 
starting out in their professions. 
Additionally, if an employer chooses to 
offer a recent foreign graduate a wage 
that equals or exceeds a particular wage 
level, the registration will be weighted 
accordingly, regardless of the 
beneficiary’s experience level or the 
requirements of the position. In fact, 
this rule will benefit talented 
international graduates who are offered 
wages at higher levels, as they will have 
a higher chance of selection compared 
to the current random selection process. 
DHS notes that this rule does not 
require any employer to offer higher 
wages. Rational employers will not offer 
wages exceeding the expected value of 
the employee’s work. To the extent an 
employer chooses to offer a higher wage, 
they are doing so because that higher 
wage is a clear reflection of the 
beneficiary’s value to the employer. 
With respect to the analysis provided 
by a commenter about the ‘‘wage level 
mirage,’’ this article appears to 
misunderstand the nature of the 
weighted selection process. The 
weighting process is generally based on 
the beneficiary’s equivalent wage level, that is, the highest wage level that the 
proffered salary would equal or exceed. 
The weighting process specifically 
allows for consideration of the proffered 
salary. Thus, even if a job offer would 
otherwise be classified as level I under 
the OEWS wage level structure for Labor 
Condition Application (LCA) purposes 
based on the requirements of the 
position, the beneficiary could still be 
assigned to a higher equivalent wage 
level based on a high salary for 
registration purposes. Furthermore, the 
analysis grouped firms that registered 
more than 2,000 H–1Bs in FYs 2021, 
2022, 2023, or 2024 together as 
‘‘outsourcers’’ to argue that ‘‘other 
companies’’ with fewer than 2,000 
registrations are disadvantaged by this 
rule because they generally register 
more level I positions despite paying 
generally higher salaries. This overlooks 
the direct impact of the rule on lottery 
outcomes of those employers of more 
than 2,000 H–1Bs who, like all other 
companies, will see fewer level I 
registrations selected and more level II, 
III and IV registrations selected. The 
comment presents no evidence that 
these ‘‘outsourcers’’ are more likely to 
register positions for workers educated 
outside the United States and neither 
the comment nor analysis acknowledges 
that the referenced cap fiscal years 
2021–2024 saw exponential growth of 
eligible registrations for beneficiaries 
with multiple eligible registrations. 
Thus, DHS does not find this analysis 
persuasive. 
To the extent that this rule may 
disadvantage recent graduates and entry 
level alien workers seeking positions 
corresponding to a lower wage level, 
these positions may instead be made 
available to U.S. graduates and workers 
starting out in their careers. This result 
would be consistent with the purpose of 
the H–1B program, which is to help 
employers fill labor shortages with 
highly skilled workers, rather than as a 
program for employers to use to replace 
U.S. workers with lower-paid, lower- 
skilled labor. As noted in the H–1B 
Proclamation, exploitation of the H–1B 
program to replace, rather than 
supplement, U.S. workers with lower- 
paid, lower-skilled labor has resulted in 
a disadvantageous labor market for U.S. 
citizens and especially for U.S. college 
graduates who are facing higher 
unemployment rates.
25
90 FR 46027 
(Sept. 24, 2025). 
Lastly, DHS disagrees that the rule is 
not sound economic policy. This rule 
will help the United States attract the 
best and brightest workers by increasing 
the chance of selection for highly 
skilled, highly paid aliens who are more 
likely to make significant contributions 
to their employers and industry, while 
also better protecting the wages, 
working conditions, and job 
opportunities of U.S. workers. 
Comment: Some commenters stated that this rule would make it more 
difficult for foreign students, recent 
graduates, trainees, postdoctoral 
fellows, and specialists seeking to 
transition from F–1 to H–1B status 
through Optional Practical Training 
(OPT) or STEM OPT extensions so that 
they can enter the workforce and launch 
their professional careers. Some 
commenters stated the proposed rule 
would limit career paths available in the 
United States for recent graduates and 
early-career professionals and would 
disrupt the F–1 to H–1B pipeline, 
potentially causing employers to stop 
hiring students and terminate OPT 
participants. A commenter remarked 
that the uncertainty of H–1B selection is 
already a source of instability for these

individuals and their employers, and 
the proposed weighted selection process 
would further disadvantage those in 
entry-level and research positions. A 
different commenter noted that OPT is 
a temporary transitional program and 
should not be viewed as guaranteed 
employment for international students, 
and without a bridge to H–1B status, 
international students would be ‘‘forced 
to leave’’ the United States despite years 
of education and contribution. Another 
commenter noted that this rule likewise 
negatively impacts companies who are 
already employing aliens as part of the 
F–1 program, but will not be able to 
transition them to the H–1B program. At 
least one commenter cited an analysis 
that found that the proposed selection 
process would reduce H–1B visas 
awarded to F–1 graduates by 7 percent 
despite these graduates earning higher 
salaries on average than other H–1B 
workers.
26
 
Response: DHS disagrees. This rule will not preclude F–1 students in the 
United States from transitioning from 
OPT to employment under the H–1B 
visa or ‘‘force’’ such students to leave. 
As stated in the NPRM, DHS recognizes 
the value in maintaining the 
opportunity for employers to secure H– 
1B workers at all wage levels, including 
those employers seeking to hire workers 
in F–1 status. While this rule generally 
may reduce the chance of selection for 
relatively lower-paid or lower-skilled 
positions, it does not create a barrier to 
being selected in the H–1B lottery. 
Further, this rule has no impact on 
OPT. To the extent that F–1 students are 
talented and obtain job offers 
corresponding to high wage levels, this 
rule may facilitate their ability to 
transition to the H–1B program. 
DHS disagrees with the analysis cited 
by some commenters about the impact 
on international students because this 
article misunderstands the nature of the 
weighted selection process that 
generally weights registrations (or 
petitions, if applicable) based on the 
highest wage level that the proffered 
wage will equal or exceed. For example, 
one commenter cites to data showing 
that ‘‘F–1 students entering the H–1B 
process earned higher salaries on 
average than non-F–1 workers, but they 
were far more likely to be placed at the 
lowest Wage Levels.’’
27
Under the 
weighted process finalized by this rule, 
F–1 students who earn relatively high 
salaries may be ranked at higher wage 
levels (the wage level that their 
proffered wage equals or exceeds, if 
OEWS wage level data is available for 
that occupation and area of 
employment) and would not be 
constrained to the ‘‘lowest wage levels’’ 
for registration purposes. 
Finally, to the extent that this rule 
does make it more difficult for some F– 
1 students seeking lower-skilled, lower- 
paid positions to transition to an H–1B 
visa, it is important to note that the 
purpose of the H–1B visa program is not 
to serve as an early career transition 
program for foreign students. Instead, 
the H–1B program was created to help 
U.S. employers fill labor shortages in 
positions requiring highly skilled or 
highly educated workers while 
protecting the wages, working 
conditions, and job opportunities of 
U.S. workers. The entry-level or other 
lower-skilled, lower-paid positions that 
these F–1 students may have filled 
could instead be made available to 
American students and recent 
graduates. DHS believes that this rule 
appropriately balances the interests of 
U.S. workers with the interests of 
petitioning employers and the alien 
workers they seek to employ as H–1B 
nonimmigrants. 
6. Negative Impacts on Mid-Level 
Workers 
Comment: In addition to negatively impacting entry-level professionals, 
some commenters claimed that this rule 
would also negatively impact mid-level 
professionals seeking H–1B visas or 
status. For instance, a commenter 
claimed that a mid-wage level employee 
would be disadvantaged by this rule 
because they would have a lower 
chance of selection. A commenter 
provided an example of a level II 
professional who is ‘‘uniquely qualified 
to lead a critical project involving 
cutting-edge technology’’ and claimed 
that the level II wage does not diminish 
the employee’s value. The commenter 
concluded that ‘‘limiting employers’ 
access to foreign talent at the two lower 
levels is not sound economic policy.’’ 
Response: DHS disagrees with the assertion that the rule would 
disadvantage mid-level professionals 
earning wages corresponding to wage 
levels II and III. Under the weighted 
selection process, level II and level III 
registrations or petitions will still have 
a reasonable chance of selection, as 
outlined in the NPRM. Specifically, as 
noted in Table 13 of the NPRM, DHS 
projects that these groups will have an 
increased probability of selection 
compared to the current random 
selection process, with the probability 
of selection increasing by 3 percent for 
level II and by 55 percent for level III. 
As noted previously, the weighted 
selection process is designed to 
incentivize employers to offer higher 
wages, which generally correlate with 
higher skill levels, while maintaining 
opportunities for employers to secure 
H–1B workers at all wage levels. This 
approach strikes a balance between 
prioritizing highly skilled and highly 
paid workers and preserving access to 
foreign talent across all wage levels. 
Comment: A commenter claimed that the proposed rule makes it more likely 
that U.S. companies could shift their 
talent acquisition policy to favor foreign 
mid-career to senior-level professionals 
rather than focusing on hiring recent 
international graduates from U.S. 
universities. 
Response: As noted, the goal of this rule is to incentivize employers to offer 
higher wages, or to petition for positions 
requiring higher skills and higher- 
skilled aliens, that are commensurate 
with higher wage levels. A U.S. 
company shifting their talent 
acquisition policy to use the H–1B 
program only for higher-skilled aliens 
more advanced in their careers aligns 
with that goal. If a U.S. company wishes 
to focus its talent acquisition policies on 
hiring recent graduates, it may focus its 
search among American graduates. 
7. Negative Impacts on International 
Students 
Comment: Many commenters expressed concern about the negative 
impact the proposed rule would have on 
international students who are studying 
at U.S. universities. Commenters stated 
that these students invest significant 
time and financial resources to obtain 
U.S. degrees, often paying substantially 
higher tuition than domestic students. 
Some commenters stated that the 
proposed rule would make it more 
difficult for these students to secure 
employment in the United States after 
graduation, effectively wasting their 
investment in U.S. education or sending 
the message that their investment and 
contributions mean little if they are not 
also high earners. Another commenter 
remarked on the many benefits that 
recent graduates bring, which help 
global companies. 
Many commenters stated that the 
proposed rule may cause international 
graduates who studied in the United 
States to relocate to other countries that 
actively welcome skilled workers, 
ultimately harming the U.S. economy 
and innovation. Some commenters 
remarked that this rule sends a

discouraging signal to prospective 
international students, who may choose 
to study in other countries with clearer 
pathways to employment and 
immigration. Some commenters noted 
that because the rule applies to the 
20,000 advanced degree exemption, it 
will deprive the workforce of graduates 
in high-demand fields. 
Another commenter said that tighter 
H–1B policies will cause the academic 
profile of international applicants to 
U.S. schools to worsen, in that the best 
students are the ones most likely to be 
discouraged from coming to the United 
States. This commenter also noted that 
despite being disproportionately at 
relatively low wage levels, international 
students currently appear to have higher 
average salaries than other H–1B visa 
holders. The commenter noted that the 
difference reflects, at least in part, the 
concentration of petitions for 
international students in relatively high- 
wage occupations and areas. 
Response: DHS disagrees that this rule will significantly harm international 
students. First, this rule will not impact 
the ability of international students to 
study in the United States, which is the 
basis of their admission to the United 
States in student status. While the 
prospect of future H–1B employment 
may be a factor in deciding whether to 
study in the United States, the 
reputation of the academic institutions 
themselves is also an important factor 
for students choosing to study in the 
United States. DHS also disagrees that 
this rule will worsen the profile of 
international students. Conversely, DHS 
believes this rule will help attract the 
best and brightest international 
students, to the extent that they will 
earn relatively high wages, as they will 
see their chances of being selected in 
the H–1B lottery increase compared to 
the current random selection process. 
As a commenter pointed out, 
international students appear to have 
higher average salaries than other H–1B 
nonimmigrants, which seems to suggest 
that international students will 
generally benefit from this rule, contrary 
to the commenter’s claims. 
DHS disagrees that this rule will lead 
U.S.-educated international students to 
relocate to other countries. On the 
contrary, DHS believes this rule will 
incentivize and facilitate the admission 
and retention of the best and brightest 
international students. Facilitating the 
admission of higher-skilled foreign 
workers, as indicated by their earning of 
wages that equal or exceed higher 
prevailing wage levels, will increase the 
United States’ competitive edge in 
attracting the ‘‘best and the brightest’’ 
students in the global labor market, 
consistent with the goals of the H–1B 
program. DHS also reiterates that recent 
graduates with master’s or higher 
degrees from U.S. institutions of higher 
education already benefit from the 
existing advanced degree exemption 
and cap selection order. 
Comment: Some commenters stated that the proposed rule would discourage 
foreign students from studying in the 
United States, citing a survey of 
international graduate students in the 
United States conducted by the Institute 
for Progress and National Association of 
Foreign Student Advisers (NAFSA): 
Association of International 
Educators.
28
Specifically, commenters 
cited the survey results finding that 53 
percent of international graduate 
student respondents would not have 
enrolled in U.S. universities if ‘‘access 
to H–1B visas was determined by wage 
levels.’’ The same survey also found that 
48 percent of master’s students, 52 
percent of Ph.D. students, and 38 
percent of postdoctoral respondents, 
who said they are currently likely to try 
to obtain another visa under current 
rules, would not do so if access to H– 
1B visas was determined by wage levels. 
Response: DHS reviewed the survey results and does not find them 
convincing.
29
In pertinent part, the 
survey concluded that ‘‘53% of 
respondents said they would not have 
enrolled in the first place if access to H– 
1B was determined by Wage Levels.’’ 
However, this rule will not result in 
‘‘access to H–1B [being] determined by 
Wage Levels.’’ Again, this final 
weighted selection process will 
maintain the opportunity for employers 
to secure H–1B workers at all wage 
levels and thus does not preclude 
‘‘access’’ to the H–1B program. While 
selection will be weighted generally 
based on corresponding wage level, it 
will not be ‘‘determined’’ by wage 
levels. This final rule also does not 
affect H–1B petitioners who are exempt 
from the H–1B cap. Similarly, the 
relevant survey question asked: ‘‘Think 
back to your decision to enroll in a US 
program. If eligibility to work for a for- 
profit employer after graduation were 
out of reach unless you are compensated 
at the highest levels and above the 
median wage for all Americans working 
in your occupation, including those 
most experienced, how likely would 
you have been to enroll in a degree- 
granting program in the US?’’ The 
survey question itself was inaccurate. 
This wage-based selection rule does not 
impact eligibility for H–1B 
classification. It also does not make 
selection in the H–1B registration ‘‘out 
of reach’’ as this rule does not create a 
barrier to getting an entry level job and 
being selected in the registration. 
Comment: Some commenters discussed how the proposed rule would 
have a negative impact on businesses 
supported by foreign students and 
faculty who provide important 
economic contributions. Some 
commenters pointed to data indicating 
that international students contribute 
billions to the U.S. economy through 
direct spending and support hundreds 
of thousands of jobs, stating the rule 
would be a setback for those 
contributions. Some commenters 
similarly remarked that lower 
enrollment of foreign students would 
mean losing the boost to local economic 
activity and jobs that they bring, and 
would have ‘‘ripple’’ or ‘‘cascading’’ 
effects on businesses that support 
colleges and universities, including 
service providers, such as restaurants 
and retail stores. One such commenter 
cited Institute of International 
Education (IIE) Open Doors data 
estimating the contribution of foreign 
students to the United States economy 
to be $44.7 billion from 2018–2019. 
Another commenter suggested that in 
2026, a 40 percent plunge to 
approximately 657,000 students would 
eviscerate $17.5 billion and 151,000 
jobs. A different commenter similarly 
expressed that NAFSA reports that 
international students contribute $43.8 
billion to the U.S. economy and create 
or support 378,175 jobs. 
A commenter said that new 
international graduates also support the 
local economies by paying rent, 
shopping in local stores, and 
volunteering. A different commenter 
remarked that the proposed rule will 
remove the ability of international 
graduates of U.S. universities to 
transition into the workforce, and 
asserted that the resulting loss in 
innovation output, startup formation, 
and tax generation would be staggering. 
The commenter suggested that the 
cumulative impact could exceed $1–2 
trillion in lost economic productivity. 
The commenter expressed that 
declining international enrollment 
would create a chain reaction, causing 
a collapse in university revenues, 
layoffs and program closures, local 
economic contraction, reduced tax 
bases, and weakened national

motivation for studying in the United States. Table

other obstacles are not related to an expectation of

competitiveness. Some commenters 
stated that new international graduates 
often are employed outside of major 
metropolitan areas, and that businesses 
in these areas rely on new graduates to 
support development, technical 
workflows, and business growth. Some 
commenters remarked that 
concentrating international students in 
major cities would strain infrastructure 
and increase housing costs. 
Response: DHS disagrees with these commenters. Since this rule does not 
impact the ability of international 
students to study in the United States, 
it does not take away the economic and 
other benefits these international 
students provide for their local 
economies and communities. In 
addition, DHS disagrees that this rule 
removes the ability of international 
graduates to enter the workforce. While 
this rule may disadvantage some recent 
graduates to the extent that they have 
job offers with salaries at relatively 
lower wage levels, this rule does not 
prevent recent graduates on F–1 status 
from transitioning to H–1B status. 
Rather, the rule will generally favor the 
allocation of H–1B visas to higher- 
skilled and higher-paid aliens while 
maintaining the opportunity for 
employers to secure H–1B workers at all 
wage levels, without disadvantaging 
employment opportunities for recent 
American graduates in the same or 
similar fields. 
Further, this rule will facilitate the 
admission of higher-skilled workers. 
Facilitating the admission of higher- 
skilled foreign workers, as indicated by 
their earning of wages that equal or 
exceed higher prevailing wage levels, is 
expected to increase the United States’ 
competitive edge in attracting the ‘‘best 
and the brightest’’ in the global labor 
market and benefit the economy. H–1B 
workers earning higher wages as a direct 
result of this rule are likely to increase, 
not decrease, many of the economic 
impacts that were described by 
commenters, such as housing or 
shopping in local stores. 
Comments citing Open Doors data 
and NAFSA analysis provided no 
evidence or rationale for their own 
beliefs that the rule would result in 
reduced enrollment and dire cascading 
effects. DHS again emphasizes that the 
weighted-selection mechanism 
preserves the possibility that level I 
registrations will be selected. Open 
Doors’ data on enrollment trends show 
total number of international students 
has grown every year since 2004/2005 
with the exception of temporary 
declines in 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 
due to COVID–19.
30
DHS notes that this 
growth in international students 
occurred despite decades of generally 
diminishing probability of obtaining an 
H–1B cap-subject visa.
31
Open Doors 
data affirm international students’ 
motivations for studying in the United 
States are complex and unlikely to 
exhibit the sensitivity commenters 
speculated would lead to a collapse of 
this talent and innovation pipeline.
32
 
8. Negative Impacts on STEM Fields 
Comment: Multiple commenters remarked on negative impacts on 
international graduates and workers 
with degrees in STEM fields as well as 
on their employers that depend on 
them. Many commenters remarked that 
recent graduates often bring the most 
current knowledge in rapidly evolving 
fields like AI, clean energy, climate 
science, public health, machine 
learning, semiconductors, 
bioinformatics, and biotechnology, and 
that they play indispensable roles on 
their teams. Commenters stated that the 
rule would lock out entry-level STEM 
graduates trained in U.S. universities, 
wasting U.S. educational investment, 
and preventing those graduates from 
contributing to the U.S. economy. 
Commenters remarked that the United 
States competes for a global talent 
pipeline, especially in areas, such as 
STEM, biotechnology, AI, data 
infrastructure, cybersecurity, 
semiconductors, quantum computing, 
advanced manufacturing, and 
healthcare, and that this rule would 
undermine the talent pipeline in these 
fields. A commenter cited data that 
foreign nationals comprise a significant 
percentage of U.S. college graduates in 
STEM fields, and noted that ‘‘U.S. 
employers aggressively recruit the top 
students from U.S. colleges and 
universities to fill early career positions 
that leverage their skills.’’ This 
commenter similarly concluded that the 
rule would erode the pipeline of ‘‘highly 
educated and talented professionals, of 
which foreign students are a critical 
component pipeline.’’ Similarly, 
another commenter cited data showing 
that foreign students represent the 
majority of STEM masters and Ph.D. 
graduates in the United States, many of 
which are entering the labor market for 
the first time. 
Commenters also specifically 
addressed the proposed rule’s negative 
impact on science and technology more 
generally, including in AI, robotics, 
machine learning, quantum computing, 
cybersecurity, electronics design and 
manufacturing, semiconductor 
manufacturing, biotechnology, digital 
health, automation, and data analytics 
fields or industries. 
The commenters expressed that their 
companies and industries rely on access 
to global talent through the H–1B 
program, and that they will be harmed 
without access to this talent. Some 
commenters claimed that there is not 
sufficient domestic talent in STEM 
fields, which is why they need 
continued access to the H–1B program. 
A commenter claimed that this rule 
would go against President Trump’s 
efforts to increase investments in the 
U.S. semiconductor industry. 
Response: DHS disagrees with these commenters. This rule will not preclude 
early-career STEM graduates from being 
selected in the H–1B lottery. While this 
rule generally may reduce the chance of 
selection for an early-career STEM 
graduate who is relatively lower-paid, it 
does not create a barrier to getting an 
entry level job and being selected in the 
H–1B cap selection process. 
Additionally, this rule incentivizes 
employers to offer a wage that equals or 
exceeds a higher wage level for a 
beneficiary with desirable skills, 
regardless of the beneficiary’s 
experience level or the requirements of 
the position, in order to increase a 
beneficiary’s chance of selection in the 
H–1B lottery. Thus, contrary to 
commenters’ claims, DHS believes this 
rule will facilitate the admission and 
retention of the best and brightest 
international students and enhance the 
talent pipeline in STEM fields.

1990s levels’’ and concluding that ‘‘the United 
States has more than a sufficient supply of workers 
available to work in STEM occupations.’’). 
To the extent that this rule will 
disincentivize U.S. companies to hire 
fewer low-skilled, low-wage foreign 
STEM workers, DHS views this as an 
overall benefit to U.S. workers. First, 
these companies could instead be 
incentivized to hire qualified U.S. 
workers to fill STEM positions, 
including those U.S. workers who have 
STEM degrees but are currently 
unemployed or underemployed.
33
As 
highlighted in the H–1B Proclamation, a 
recent study indicated that in 2023, 
unemployment among recent computer 
science and computer engineering 
graduates was high as compared to 
graduates with other majors.
34
90 FR 
46027 (Sept. 24, 2025). Notably, the 
abuse of the H–1B visa program has 
made it even more challenging for 
college graduates trying to find IT jobs, 
allowing employers to hire foreign 
workers at a significant discount to U.S. 
workers. 90 FR 46027 (Sept. 24, 2025). 
Observers have written that there are 
plenty of qualified U.S. workers with 
STEM degrees or pursuing such degrees 
who are seeking employment in these 
fields.
35
 
Second, companies that have 
historically relied on a steady pool of 
lower-skilled, lower-wage foreign STEM 
workers could instead be incentivized to 
hire highly skilled foreign workers who 
would be more likely to supplement, 
rather than replace, U.S. workers. Many 
of these companies are the same 
companies that have laid off their U.S. 
workers and replaced them with low- 
paid H–1B workers. Again, as 
highlighted in the H–1B Proclamation, 
reports indicate that many U.S. tech 
companies have laid off their qualified 
and highly skilled U.S. workers and 
simultaneously hired thousands of H– 
1B workers.
36
90 FR 46027 (Sept. 24, 
2025). Information technology firms, in 
particular, have prominently 
manipulated the H–1B system, 
significantly harming U.S. workers in 
computer-related fields. The high 
numbers of relatively low-wage workers 
in the H–1B program undercut the 
integrity of the program and are 
detrimental to U.S. workers’ wages and 
labor opportunities, especially at the 
entry level, in industries where such 
low-paid H–1B workers are 
concentrated. In fact, workers in 
computer related fields have seen 
virtually no real wage growth in 
decades; and real wages for all types of 
engineers as well as several other STEM 
occupations, including software 
developers, have stagnated or even 
declined in the past decades.
37
 
9. Negative Impacts on Academic 
Institutions 
Comment: Some commenters expressed concern that the proposed 
weighted H–1B selection process would 
negatively impact U.S. universities and 
higher education institutions. 
Commenters stated that the rule would 
reduce the attractiveness of U.S. 
universities for international students 
and undermine the competitiveness of 
U.S. higher educational institutions. 
Commenters stated that international 
students provide essential tuition 
revenue for U.S. universities, which this 
rule would threaten. At least one 
commenter claimed that international 
students essentially subsidize domestic 
students at U.S. colleges and 
universities, making it cheaper for U.S.- 
born students to receive higher 
education and cushioning public 
universities’ budgets in the face of 
declining state appropriations. Some 
commenters acknowledged that U.S. 
institutions of higher education are 
exempt from the H–1B cap, but that the 
proposed changes to the H–1B selection 
process would still have negative, and 
potentially long-term, effects on U.S. 
higher education. A commenter 
mentioned that the U.S. higher 
education system would be destabilized 
by the proposed rule as it recovers from 
low enrollment and financial strain due 
to the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 
(COVID–19) pandemic. Commenters 
also noted that international students 
provide other types of benefits to 
educational institutions and their 
surrounding communities, including 
exposure to new ideas and cultures. 
A commenter referenced a survey 
conducted by NAFSA estimating a 
possible 30 to 40 percent drop in foreign 
student enrollment for the 2025–2026 
academic year, which could have a 
significant impact on the U.S. economy. 
Response: DHS does not believe that this rule will have a significant negative 
impact on the ability of U.S. colleges 
and universities to recruit talented 
international students. To the contrary, 
DHS believes this rule is more likely to 
enhance an academic institution’s 
ability to attract the best and brightest 
international students through offering 
them an increased chance of H–1B 
employment if they secure a job offer at 
a salary that corresponds to a higher 
wage level. To the extent that this 
change will negatively affect the ability 
of some colleges and universities to 
recruit lower-skilled or less-experienced 
international students, DHS believes 
that any such harm will be outweighed 
by the benefits of better ensuring that 
initial H–1B visas and status grants

The commenter cited to a Fall 2025 
International Student Enrollment Outlook and 
Economic Impact survey conducted by NAFSA: 
Association of International Educators (Aug. 8, 
2025), https://www.nafsa.org/fall-2025- international-student-enrollment-outlook-and- 
economic-impact. DHS reviewed the survey. The survey listed four factors as driving the claimed 
decline in international student enrollment: visa 
interview suspension, limited appointment 
availability, visa issuance trends, and visa bans. All 
four factors specifically relate to visa issues, not the 
H–1B registration process. 
39
DHS, USCIS, OPQ, CLAIMS 3 and ELIS, 
queried 10/2025, PAER0019172. Approvals of 
Petitions from Cap Exempt Employers, By Cap 
Exemption and New Employment and Renewal/ 
Amendment Filings, October 2025. This data shows 
the following breakdown for total cap-exempt H–1B 
approvals in FY25: 24,835 for institutions of higher 
education; 19,866 for affiliated or related nonprofit 
entities; 5,654 for nonprofit research organizations 
or governmental research organizations; and 3,634 
for beneficiaries employed at a qualifying cap 
exempt entity. This data further shows total cap- 
exempt approvals in the above categories as 
follows: 25,452 for New Employment and 23,901 for 
Renewals/Amendments. Some petitioners selected 
‘‘Yes’’ on multiple questions, which is why the 
totals are higher than the sum of the individual 
categories. 
would more likely go to higher-paid, 
higher-skilled beneficiaries. Facilitating 
the admission of higher-skilled foreign 
workers, as indicated by their earning of 
wages that equal or exceed higher 
prevailing wage levels, would benefit 
the economy and increase the United 
States’ competitive edge in attracting the 
‘‘best and the brightest’’ in the global 
labor market, consistent with the goals 
of the H–1B program discussed in the 
NPRM. Concerning the survey the 
commenter referenced, the commenter 
did not indicate that there was a 
correlation between the potential 
change in international student 
enrollment and this rule.
38
Further, DHS 
expects this rule to have a positive effect 
on the economy, which could 
counteract any negative economic 
effects caused by a potential drop in 
enrollment. Regarding the cultural 
benefits that international students 
provide, DHS reiterates that this rule 
will not ban international students from 
coming to or remaining in the United 
States, so this aspect is unlikely to be 
affected. 
Comment: Commenters remarked that this rule would negatively impact U.S. 
universities to attract the best students 
because many students select the United 
States for the opportunity to work in the 
United States following graduation. 
Some of these commenters specifically 
addressed the OPT program and the 
possibility of F–1 students transitioning 
to an H–1B visa. The commenters stated 
that this rule risks deterring 
international students who wish to 
study in the United States specifically 
because of the prospect of OPT 
employment. Some commenters stated 
that the proposed rule would create a 
policy contradiction: the government 
issues student visas, allows OPT, and 
promotes U.S. degrees as a pathway to 
opportunity, but then erects a barrier to 
getting the first job. 
Response: DHS does not believe that this rule creates a policy contradiction 
or threatens the pipeline of students 
who wish to study in the United States. 
This rule will not impact the ability of 
international students to study in the 
United States, which is the basis of their 
admission to the United States in F–1 
nonimmigrant status. Further, this rule 
has no impact on OPT. While this rule 
generally may reduce the chance of 
selection for relatively lower-paid or 
lower-skilled positions, it does not 
create a barrier to getting a job on OPT 
or transitioning to H–1B nonimmigrant 
status. Rather, as explained previously, 
for international students who are 
offered jobs with a salary that 
corresponds to a higher wage level, this 
rule increases their chance for selection 
in the H–1B cap selection process as 
compared to their chances in the current 
random selection process. 
Comment: Some commenters opposed the proposal because they reasoned it 
would harm research, stating that 
universities and research labs depend 
on international students and graduates. 
For instance, a commenter stated that 
entry-level graduates are essential to the 
future of the U.S. workforce as they 
often work in research labs, develop 
new technologies, and fill important 
roles. Another commenter said master’s 
and Ph.D. graduates perform a 
disproportionate share of research labor 
and contribute to Federal grant 
deliverables, and denying them 
equitable access to H–1B visas reduces 
the return on public and private 
educational spending. A different 
commenter noted that research labs 
depend on international workers, and 
that if research labs cannot obtain the 
foreign workers they need, then this rule 
could also harm U.S. students who wish 
to work in research labs after 
graduation. Similarly, a commenter 
wrote that the large population of 
international students in STEM doctoral 
programs and federally funded labs 
generate patents, publications, and 
breakthroughs, significantly 
contributing to U.S. scientific discovery. 
The commenter stated discoveries in 
labs can emerge from researchers who 
begin in wage level I positions and 
eliminating these positions through the 
proposed rule would lead to fewer 
advancements, and reduced U.S. 
influence in global research. 
Response: DHS disagrees with the assertions that this rule will harm 
research or research facilities. The 
weighted selection process 
implemented through this rule impacts 
the probability of selection towards the 
H–1B cap. H–1B petitions for aliens 
who are employed by, or have received 
offers of employment at, U.S. 
institutions of higher education, 
nonprofit entities related to or affiliated 
with U.S. institutions of higher 
education, or nonprofit research 
organizations or governmental research 
organizations are exempt from the H–1B 
cap. See INA sec. 214(g)(5), 8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(5). Many employers and aliens 
described by these commenters would 
be cap-exempt and therefore not 
impacted by this rule. In FY 2025 alone, 
USCIS approved over 49,000 petitions 
that qualified under one of these cap 
exemptions.
39
In the scenarios where 
researchers are not cap-exempt, DHS 
believes this rule will have a positive 
impact by increasing the chance of 
selection for highly paid, highly skilled 
foreign researchers and encouraging 
employers to hire American graduates 
for research positions instead of lower- 
paid aliens. Additionally, DHS disagrees 
with the concern that level I positions 
will be eliminated by this rule. The 
weighted selection implemented 
through this rule favors the allocation of 
H–1B visas to higher-skilled and higher- 
paid aliens while maintaining the 
opportunity for employers to secure H– 
1B workers at all wage levels. 
Comment: Some commenters said the rule would decrease U.S. universities’ 
access to or ability to recruit 
international faculty. One commenter 
asserted that wage-based weighting 
could exacerbate dental faculty 
shortages at schools accredited by the 
Commission on Dental Accreditation 
and could thereby limit access to dental 
education. 
Response: DHS disagrees that this rule will decrease the ability of academic 
institutions to recruit or retain 
international faculty. Again, this rule 
will increase the chance of selection for 
those who will be paid a wage that 
corresponds to higher wage levels and 
thus is more likely to facilitate the 
selection of higher paid, higher skilled 
international faculty for cap-subject H– 
1B status. 
Also, many petitions for U.S. 
universities and other academic 
institutions of higher learning will 
likely not be affected by this rule. 
Congress already exempted from the 
annual H–1B cap aliens who are 
employed by, or have received offers of 
employment at, U.S. institutions of 
higher education, nonprofit entities

DHS notes that some commenters use the term 
International Medical Graduate (IMG) when 
addressing this rule. DHS further notes that, as 
stated in a study cited by a commenter, the term 
IMG may refer to the location of a physician’s 
medical school, rather than citizenship, and as such 
IMGs may include U.S. citizens and other aliens not 
seeking H–1B status. See Awad Ahmed, Wei-Ting

Comment: Some commenters expressed concern that the proposed 
weighted selection process would 
negatively impact public and private 
schools that are already experiencing 
difficulties recruiting qualified K–12 
teachers in certain areas, such as STEM 
subjects. Some of these commenters 
specifically noted the difficulties faced 
by public schools, particularly in rural, 
low income, or other underserved 
communities. These commenters stated 
that the rule would harm such schools, 
leaving them without critical staff. 
Another commenter, expressing concern 
over the rule’s impact on public schools, 
stated that public school districts cannot 
adjust salaries to compete for higher 
wage levels, because teacher 
compensation is determined by state or 
district salary schedules which are 
established through statute or collective 
bargaining. The commenter emphasized 
the importance of prioritizing all 
qualified educators, including those at 
entry or mid-career level likely to be at 
level I or level II wage levels. 
Response: Some public schools may be exempt from the H–1B cap based on 
their affiliation with U.S. institutions of 
higher education. For those public or 
private schools that are not cap-exempt 
and are unable to proffer wages that 
equal or exceed prevailing wage levels 
with greater chances of selection, 
including those with compensation 
levels outside of the employer’s control, 
they may be able to find available and 
qualified workers outside of the H–1B 
program, including U.S. workers. 
10. Negative Impacts on the Healthcare 
Sector 
Comment: Multiple commenters said the proposed rule would have a negative 
impact on the healthcare sector. A 
commenter stated that International 
Medical Graduates (IMGs)
41
account for 
significant portions of healthcare 
personnel, with others noting that H– 
1Bs are heavily utilized in the field. 
Some commenters stated that when 
hospitals face staffing shortages, in 
specialized areas and generally, 
international medical professionals help 
fill gaps in the workforce and that a 
weighted selection would limit access to 
qualified healthcare workers. Some 
commenters cited a U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services statistic 
estimating a shortfall of around 187,000 
physicians by 2037. Another commenter 
also noted that the proposed rule could 
encourage highly qualified, early-career 
physicians to practice in other 
countries. A commenter noted that 
international doctors were critical 
during COVID–19 and, without them, 
public health crises would be harder to 
manage. 
Numerous commenters remarked that 
critical fields, such as healthcare, may 
offer lower starting salaries compared to 
other sectors and said that the proposed 
rule would ‘‘restrict access to 
international experts’’ who rely on H– 
1B visas to work in these sectors. 
Another commenter, expressing concern 
about eliminating a healthcare talent 
pipeline, wrote that healthcare 
professionals in their required training 
period are in level I or level II positions 
and that level I wages reflect the cost 
structure of supervised practice. 
Another commenter, using the 
healthcare industry as an example of 
industries whose wage structures are 
incompatible with the proposed rule, 
wrote that medical residents and 
fellows, despite being some of the most 
highly educated workers in the United 
States, earn wages that would typically 
be categorized as level I, leading to a 
reduced probability of being granted H– 
1B status and an exacerbation of the 
physician shortage. 
More than one commenter wrote that 
hospitals and healthcare systems cannot 
easily meet higher wage levels or absorb 
compliance costs, particularly small to 
mid-sized healthcare providers. Another 
commenter remarked that the OEWS 
system under the proposed rule does 
not reflect healthcare compensation 
schemes, which often use standardized 
pay scales determined by facility 
budgets and Medicare reimbursement. 
One commenter predicted that adoption 
of the final rule would lead to 
consolidation in the healthcare field and 
higher costs for patients. Another 
commenter suggested that non-profit 
hospitals, even in urban areas, would be 
at a disadvantage compared to for-profit 
corporations, creating disparities within 
the same city. 
A commenter noted that wages for 
physicians vary by medical specialty. 
The commenter expressed concern 
about the impacts of the rule on primary 
care physicians, stating that primary 
care physicians’ wages tend to be lower 
than the wages of procedure-oriented 
specialists. The commenter stated the 
rule could incentivize IMGs to apply for 
higher paying subspecialty positions to 
increase their chance of selection, 
which would further exacerbate 
shortages in lower paying specialties. 
The commenter stated that the rule will 
exacerbate shortages in nephrologists 
and thus lead to an increase in mortality 
for people burdened by kidney disease. 
Similarly, another commenter 
expressed concern that the new rule 
would disproportionately disadvantage 
dentists serving in community health 
centers and public hospitals and could 
worsen access to dental care for 
vulnerable populations, including in 
underserved and rural areas. The 
commenter stated that many federally 
qualified health centers that employ H– 
1B dentists operate on fixed budgets and 
cannot match salaries offered by private 
or technology sectors. 
Response: DHS disagrees that this rule will negatively affect the healthcare 
sector. Many H–1B petitions for 
healthcare workers are cap-exempt. 
From FY 2020 through FY 2025, more 
than 94 percent of H–1B petitions 
approved for initial employment for 
physicians, surgeons, and dentists were 
cap-exempt and thus not subject to the 
H–1B cap selection process.
42
In 
addition, Congress has established 
programs meant to encourage certain 
recent foreign medical graduates to 
serve in the United States as H–1B 
nonimmigrants. These programs are 
exempt from the annual H–1B cap and 
unaffected by this rule. Certain J–1 
exchange visitors are subject to a 2-year

requires them to return to their country 
of nationality or country of last 
residence for at least two years in the 
aggregate prior to being eligible to apply 
for an immigrant visa; adjustment of 
status; or certain nonimmigrant visas, 
including H–1B visas (with limited 
exceptions). See INA sec. 212(e), 8 U.S.C. 1182(e); INA sec. 248, 8 U.S.C. 
1258. However, INA sec. 214(l), 8 U.S.C. 
1184(l), contains provisions authorizing 
waivers of the 2-year foreign residence 
requirement for certain aliens, including 
foreign medical graduates who agree to 
work full-time (at least 40 hours per 
week) in H–1B classification for not less 
than three years in a shortage area 
designated by the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS) with 
a request from an interested Federal 
Government agency or state agency of 
public health or its equivalent, or with 
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. 
See INA sec. 214(l), 8 U.S.C. 1184(l). See also 8 CFR 212.7(c)(9). The petition requesting a change to H–1B 
nonimmigrant status for these 
physicians is not subject to the 
numerical limitations contained in INA 
sec. 214(g)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(1)(A). 
See INA sec. 214(l)(2)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1184(l)(2)(A). While participation in the 
Conrad 30 program (relating to waivers 
based on requests from a state agency of 
public health or its equivalent for 
service in an HHS-designated shortage 
area) is limited to 30 participants per 
eligible jurisdiction annually, the other 
programs have no limits on the number 
of participants. See INA sec. 214(l)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. 1184(l)(1)(B). 
In the scenarios where they are not 
cap-exempt, DHS believes this rule may 
have a positive impact for some highly 
skilled, highly paid aliens. DHS notes 
that shortages of medical professionals 
are multi-causal and beyond the scope 
of one visa category to address. With 
respect to the ability to offer increased 
wages generally, DHS acknowledges 
that healthcare institutions, like 
employers in all industries, are 
impacted by a variety of factors in 
determining employee salary. For 
employers unable to proffer wages that 
equal or exceed prevailing wage levels 
with greater chances of selection, they 
may be able to find available and 
qualified workers outside of the H–1B 
program, including U.S. workers. 
Additionally, it is possible that aliens 
filling the positions described by these 
commenters would be eligible for 
alternate immigrant or nonimmigrant 
classifications offering employment 
authorization. 
Further, DHS disagrees with the 
comment that this rule may unfairly 
discriminate against primary care 
physicians who typically have lower 
annual salaries than certain specialty 
physicians. In general, family 
physicians or other primary care 
physicians have different SOC codes 
than specialty physicians. As DOL 
prevailing wage level calculations 
generally differ by SOC codes, when 
wage data is available, the 
corresponding wage level would 
necessarily account for the different 
occupational classification for primary 
care physicians as opposed to other 
types of physicians. When such wage 
level data is unavailable, wage level 
weighting will be based on the skill, 
education, and experience requirements 
for the position, again taking into 
account the particulars of the relevant 
occupational classification, such that 
registrations or petitions for primary 
care physicians will be weighted in 
comparison to the normal requirements 
for primary care physicians and not in 
comparison to other types of physicians. 
As such, DHS does not believe that this 
rule will disadvantage registrations or 
petitions for primary care physicians or 
any other subset of physicians. 
Comment: Some commenters identified other employers and 
professionals in the healthcare field 
who would be negatively impacted by 
this rule, including nurses; pharmacists; 
laboratory technologists, healthcare IT 
professionals working in data security, 
analytics, and telehealth systems who 
are protecting patient data and 
furthering innovation; and therapists 
and counselors providing mental health 
and other services. Some commenters 
noted that those in emergency 
preparedness fields who partner with 
healthcare workers will be negatively 
impacted by this rule. These 
commenters generally stated that the 
rule would make it financially and 
logistically difficult for healthcare- 
related employers to recruit and retain 
essential staff. 
Response: Overall, DHS believes this rule will have a positive impact by 
increasing the chance of selection for 
the most highly skilled, highly paid 
aliens within each SOC code and 
encouraging companies to hire U.S. 
workers. For employers unable to 
proffer wages that equal or exceed 
prevailing wage levels with greater 
chances of selection, they may be able 
to find available and qualified workers 
outside of the H–1B program, including 
U.S. workers. DHS notes that shortages 
in the number, distribution, and 
specialties of medical professionals are 
multi-causal and beyond the scope of 
one visa category to address. DHS 
believes that this rule will promote the 
interests of U.S. workers—and those 
students and trainees who are future 
workers—in line with administration 
priorities. Additionally, it is possible 
that aliens filling the positions 
described by these commenters would 
be eligible for alternate immigrant or 
nonimmigrant classifications offering 
employment authorization. 
11. Negative Impacts on Rural or 
Underserved Communities 
Comment: Multiple commenters stated that the proposed rule would 
have a particularly negative impact on 
healthcare in rural and underserved 
areas with one commenter noting the 
unique and complex challenges faced by 
patients in rural areas. A commenter 
stated that in falsely assuming high- 
skilled workers are paid a higher wage, 
the rule devalues high-skilled 
physicians in underserved areas and 
could lead to the consolidation of 
physicians in larger healthcare 
organizations, leading to greater costs 
for patients. Some commenters 
expressed specific concerns that 
underserved or rural areas that are 
reliant on international doctors would 
face difficulties with or lose healthcare 
access, with one commenter noting such 
areas could potentially face facility 
closure. Without citing specific data, a 
commenter remarked that IMGs are 
more likely to serve in rural and 
underserved areas compared to their 
U.S. counterparts. The commenter said 
that the proposed rule disincentivizes 
entering specialty programs with lower 
wages, further exacerbating primary care 
shortages in rural and underserved 
areas. Another commenter similarly 
opined that because U.S. medical 
graduates typically apply for and locate 
in urban and higher-income areas, when 
non-urban medical facilities lose access 
to IMGs because of the proposed rule, 
they would struggle to find alternative 
healthcare worker options. The 
commenter reasoned that the result 
would be the closure of emergency 
rooms, obstetric services, and specialty 
care, creating ‘‘medical deserts’’ that 
require rural residents to travel hours 
for basic medical care. 
Response: DHS acknowledges the important role that foreign physicians 
may play in providing healthcare in 
rural and/or underserved communities, 
including early career and entry level 
physicians. As explained in response to 
the previous comments, Congress has 
established programs meant to direct 
foreign medical graduates to those 
communities.

2025, PAER0019171, showing that, from FY 2020 
through FY 2025, on average more than 94 percent 
of H–1B petitions approved for initial employment 
for physicians, surgeons, and dentists were cap- 
exempt and not subject to the H–1B cap selection 
process). 
As noted previously, physicians 
whose nonimmigrant status is changed 
to H–1B through their participation in 
any of the three waiver programs in INA 
sec. 214(l), 8 U.S.C. 1184(l), are not 
subject to the annual H–1B caps. The 
Conrad 30 program (relating to waivers 
based on requests from a state agency of 
public health or its equivalent for 
service in an HHS-designated shortage 
area) is limited to 30 participants per 
eligible jurisdiction annually. See INA sec. 214(l)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. 1184(l)(1)(B). 
However, there are no annual limits on 
the number of aliens who can obtain a 
waiver through service in an HHS- 
designated shortage area based on the 
request of an interested Federal 
Government agency. Since these 
programs are not subject to the annual 
H–1B caps, they will not be affected by 
this rule and the programs will continue 
to provide a pipeline for these 
physicians to serve in HHS-designated 
shortage areas. 
Congress has established a similar 
statute in the immigrant context, which 
also channels physicians to serve in 
HHS-designated shortage areas, 
commonly known as the Physician 
National Interest Waiver Program. See 
INA sec. 203(b)(2)(B)(ii)(I), 8 U.S.C. 
1153(b)(2)(B)(ii). That program has no 
limits on the number of physicians who 
can participate in a given fiscal year, 
though there are numerical limitations 
on the number of employment-based 
immigrant visas that can be allocated 
annually. This program is unaffected by 
this rule and will continue to provide a 
pipeline for an unlimited number of 
physicians to serve in HHS-designated 
shortage areas. 
DHS acknowledges that some alien 
physicians seeking to serve in rural or 
underserved areas would be subject to 
H–1B numerical limitations. DHS is 
aware that medical institutions in rural 
or underserved areas may not be U.S. 
institutions of higher education, related 
or affiliated non-profit entities, or non- 
profit research organizations or 
governmental research organizations 
and, as a result, aliens who are 
employed by or who have received an 
offer of employment from such medical 
institutions may not be exempt from the 
annual H–1B numerical limitations 
under INA sec. 214(g)(5), 8 U.S.C. 
1184(g)(5). DHS also acknowledges that 
not all alien physicians who serve in 
rural or underserved areas as H–1B 
nonimmigrants are participating in the 
waiver programs of INA sec. 214(l), 8 
U.S.C. 1184(l). However, some medical 
institutions in rural or underserved 
areas do meet the requirements to be 
cap-exempt, and their employees will 
not be subject to the numerical 
limitations.
43
To the extent these 
physicians are subject to H–1B 
numerical limitations, DHS believes this 
rule will have a positive impact by 
increasing the chance of selection for 
highly skilled, highly paid aliens. 
Additionally, it is possible physicians 
may avail themselves of alternative 
pathways to serve in these areas. 
Further, as with all other registrations, 
DHS will weigh and select registrations 
for these positions generally according 
to the highest OEWS prevailing wage 
level that the proffered wage equals or 
exceeds, which necessarily takes into 
account the area of intended 
employment when such wage level data 
is available. Where there is no current 
OEWS prevailing wage information for 
the proffered position, which DHS 
recognizes is the case for some 
physician positions based on limitations 
in OEWS data, the registrant would 
follow DOL guidance on prevailing 
wage determinations to determine 
which OEWS wage level to select on the 
registration. The determination of the 
appropriate wage level in those 
instances would be based on the skill, 
education, and experience requirements 
of the position, and generally does not 
take into consideration the area of 
intended employment. Therefore, DHS 
does not believe that this rule 
necessarily will disadvantage rural and/ 
or underserved communities relative to 
registrations or petitions based on offers 
of employment in other areas. 
Comment: Expressing concern about the impact of the rule on rural 
healthcare, a commenter pointed 
specifically to the impact on nurses in 
H–1B status, stating that in fiscal year 
2025, 34 out of the 367 nurses they 
hired were on H–1B visas. The 
commenter interpreted data presented 
in the NPRM as stating that nurses will 
be treated as a level I position, 
disadvantaging them as compared to 
certain other SOC codes. 
Response: DHS disagrees with the commenter’s blanket assumption that 
nurses will be treated as a level I 
position or will be disadvantaged 
compared to other SOC codes. DHS 
aims to incentivize employers to offer 
higher wages, or to petition for positions 
requiring higher skills and higher 
skilled aliens that are commensurate 
with higher wage levels, across all 
occupations. Under this rule, 
registrations (or petitions, as applicable) 
will be weighted generally based on the 
highest OEWS wage level that the 
prospective beneficiary’s proffered wage 
equals or exceeds for the relevant SOC 
code in the area(s) of intended 
employment. Employers may choose to 
offer a higher wage to a prospective 
beneficiary whose skill level they value 
and who they wish to retain to increase 
that beneficiary’s chances of selection. 
12. Negative Impact on Small 
Businesses, Startups, and Nonprofits 
Comment: Several commenters said the proposed rule would have a negative 
impact on small businesses, startups, 
and nonprofits. Multiple commenters 
stated that smaller entities, startups, and 
nonprofits cannot afford to pay higher 
wage levels compared to large 
corporations and often rely on 
international talent or new graduates to 
support their business. A commenter 
said that small businesses and startups 
will not be able to afford such wage 
premiums, as they frequently operate 
with limited capital while offering 
alternative incentives like equity 
ownership, stock options, or future 
profit participation, which would not be 
recognized under the proposed 
weighted-lottery selection process. 
Similarly, commenters wrote that small 
companies typically lack financial 
resources or legal staff compared to 
large corporations with more resources. 
One commenter did an analysis to show 
that small businesses would be 
disproportionately adversely affected by 
the proposed weighting scheme. This 
analysis showed that since small 
businesses disproportionately have 
petitions at wage levels I and II, their 
projected share of H–1B visas would 
fall. 
A few commenters specified that the 
burden of increased compliance, 
including documenting wage levels, 
SOC codes, and matching registration 
and petition data, may 
disproportionately strain small 
companies with fewer resources and 
often without in-house legal or human 
resources (HR) compliance teams. 
One commenter remarked that the 
proposed rule may deter talented 
workers who are seeking opportunities 
at small businesses or startups that 
typically offer lower wages. Another 
commenter stated that although the 
proposed weighted selection process 
will disadvantage all U.S. companies 
that have talent needs that are not met 
by the domestic labor market, the 
problem will be worse for smaller-sized 
employers, and especially for small non- 
profit employers that are not cap-

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260888 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations exempt. Numerous commenters 
suggested that the proposed rule would 
disadvantage veteran-owned businesses 
that are often small and benefit from 
specialized international workers. Some 
commenters remarked that nonprofits 
help underserved communities and 
without international experts, 
vulnerable populations could suffer 
without support. 
Response: This rule does not treat people who work for small businesses, 
startups, non-profits, or other small- 
sized entities (including veteran-owned 
businesses) differently than those who 
work for large, established companies. 
While DHS recognizes that some small- 
sized entities may operate on smaller 
margins than larger companies, if an 
employer values a beneficiary’s work 
and the unique qualities the beneficiary 
possesses, the employer could offer a 
higher wage than required by the 
prevailing wage level to reflect that 
value. This rule will benefit those small 
entities that are applying for relatively 
higher-paid employees, as they will 
have a greater chance of their employees 
being selected compared to the current 
random selection process. If a small- 
sized entity is unable to pay a 
beneficiary at a higher wage level for a 
greater chance of selection, they could 
try to find a U.S. worker. U.S. 
employers, including small-sized 
entities, could also consider hiring 
recent American graduates to meet their 
business needs while playing an integral 
part in the U.S. worker’s career growth. 
DHS acknowledges that this final rule 
will have an economic impact on small 
businesses, startups, or other small- 
sized entities that can only offer a level 
I wage, as those registrations will have 
a lesser chance of selection than under 
the current random selection process. 
However, as explained in the NPRM, 
DHS conducted an initial regulatory 
flexibility analysis and found no other 
alternatives that achieved the stated 
objectives with less burden to small 
entities. 90 FR 45986, 46016 (Sept. 24, 
2025). Given that 76 percent of unique 
cap-subject H–1B filers are small 
entities, and 47 percent of H–1B cap 
petitions in FY 2024 were filed by small 
entities, any alternative process that 
provides a different, preferential 
weighting scheme for small entities 
would undermine the overall utility of 
this rule, which is to generally favor the 
allocation of H–1B visas to higher- 
skilled and higher-paid aliens. And as 
mentioned previously, it is possible that 
any alternative that imposes a lower 
burden on small entities generally could 
also reduce those employers’ chance of 
selection for higher wage level workers. 
DHS also disagrees that the burden of 
complying with the rule will 
disproportionately affect smaller 
employers. As stated in the NPRM, DHS 
estimates that the changes implemented 
in this rule would increase the time 
burden by 20 minutes for each 
registration and by 15 minutes for each 
petition, whether completed by an HR 
specialist, in-house lawyer, or 
outsourced lawyer. If a smaller 
employer is using an outsourced 
specialist for H–1B work in general, the 
additional paperwork burden associated 
with this rule is unlikely to be 
substantial in most cases. 
Finally, DHS does not believe this 
rule will have a significant negative 
impact on nonprofit organizations. 
Congress already exempted from the H– 
1B cap any alien who is employed or 
has received an offer of employment at 
a U.S. institution of higher education, a 
non-profit entity related or affiliated 
with a U.S. institution of higher 
education, or a non-profit research 
organization or a governmental research 
organization. See INA sec. 214(g)(5), 8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(5); 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(8)(iii)(F). Thus, many petitions 
for nonprofits will not be affected by 
this rule. For those nonprofit entities 
that are not cap-exempt and are unable 
to proffer wages that equal or exceed 
prevailing wage levels with greater 
chances of selection, they may be able 
to find available and qualified U.S. 
workers. 
13. Industry and Occupational 
Disparities 
Comment: Some commenters expressed concern that the proposed 
rule would disproportionately favor 
certain industries and occupations over 
others, as some sectors have more 
financial resources and are more readily 
able to absorb the costs associated with 
offering higher wages. Some 
commenters said that industries with 
naturally higher wage structures, such 
as technology and finance, would have 
an advantage over sectors with lower 
prevailing wages, regardless of the 
importance or skill level of the 
positions. 
Other commenters asserted that the 
rule would put some industries at a 
competitive disadvantage. Many 
commenters said that wage-based 
selection would privilege existing high- 
income sectors and reinforce barriers for 
professionals working in critical lower- 
paying fields, positions that are often 
hard to fill and vital to U.S. long-term 
competitiveness. Some commenters 
remarked that the proposed rule may 
have a negative effect on the arts and 
other creative and recreational 
endeavors in the United States. One 
commenter said that the rule will harm 
educators, health care workers, and 
nonprofit professionals. A commenter 
said that a wage-based selection system 
is biased against certain professions, 
particularly lower-paying professions 
like research, healthcare, urban 
planning, and civil engineering. This 
commenter asserted that the additional 
financial burden of offering higher 
wages would eliminate some industries’ 
abilities to use the H–1B program. Other 
commenters wrote that the rule creates 
a significant bias towards large 
multinational technology corporations 
and disfavors the engineering industry, 
which is already facing a critical labor 
shortage. One commenter said that 
architecture, engineering, and 
construction industries would be 
disadvantaged under the proposed 
rule’s weighting system, and another 
commenter suggested that every 
engineering hire should be in a bracket 
based on the specific industry, rather 
than all competing against software 
engineers. A few other commenters 
discussed the rule’s perceived 
disproportionate harm on 
manufacturers, particularly on small- 
and medium-sized manufacturers and 
manufacturers in the electro-industry, 
stating that many jobs in the 
manufacturing industry fall into lower 
wage levels. A different commenter 
suggested that employers, such as 
universities, hospitals, regional service 
firms, and manufacturers that maintain 
distributed or hybrid operations would 
be penalized. A commenter said that the 
proposed rule unfairly disadvantages 
essential infrastructure and public- 
interest professions—such as civil, 
structural, environmental, and 
transportation engineering—whose 
wages are tied to public-sector pay 
scales and regional cost-of-living 
differences rather than individual skill 
or value to the nation. Citing data on 
median salaries per wage level, another 
commenter stated that the proposed H– 
1B cap selection process disadvantages 
innovative technology companies that 
pay significantly higher wages even at 
lower wage levels, and remarked that 
the proposed rule fails to fulfill 
President Trump’s directive to prioritize 
high-paid nonimmigrants, as it does not 
account for the substantial wage 
differences between industries and 
employers at the same wage level. 
Other commenters expressed concern 
that the wage-based weighting system 
would create a system that prioritizes 
‘‘roles less important to U.S. interests.’’ 
The commenters stated that, due to the 
complex nature of wage level 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:36 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\29DER2.SGM 29DER2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260889 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations calculations, there are scenarios where 
individuals assigned a high wage level 
in an occupation that the commenter 
considered less important to national 
interests would receive more entries in 
the H–1B lottery than an individual 
assigned a lower wage level in a more 
important occupation. The commenter 
provided examples of how a landscape 
architect and acupuncturist with higher 
wage level salaries would have higher 
chances of selection than an AI 
researcher, surgeon, or startup 
executive. 
Response: This rule does not, and is 
not intended to, treat any industries 
better or worse than others. Nor does 
this rule seek to prioritize ‘‘roles less 
important to U.S. interests.’’ DHS 
acknowledges that, as stated in the 
NPRM, this rule will likely impact the 
number of selected registrations for 
certain SOC codes, with some 
occupations possibly seeing a decrease 
in selected H–1B registrations while 
others seeing an increase. 90 FR 45986, 
46008–09 (Sept. 24, 2025). However, the 
goal of this rule is to implement a 
weighted selection process that would 
generally favor the allocation of H–1B 
visas to higher-skilled and higher-paid 
aliens, while ensuring meaningful 
opportunities for selection regardless of 
industry or profession. An employer 
could offer a higher wage than required 
by the prevailing wage level to reflect 
the value of the prospective employee; 
an employer that chooses not to do so, 
or cannot do so, may still enter a 
registration that would potentially be 
selected. DHS believes this rule will 
benefit the best and brightest workers in 
all professions and industries. 
14. Geographic and Regional Disparities 
Comment: Some commenters said that the weighted selection process fails to 
account for regional differences in wage 
levels, creating geographic inequities 
and favoring employers in high-wage 
metropolitan areas while disadvantaging 
those in regions with lower costs of 
living and correspondingly lower 
prevailing wages. Some commenters 
remarked that talent would concentrate 
in high-cost regions, such as Silicon 
Valley and the Bay Area, noting that 
wages differ substantially by location 
due to regional cost-of-living variation, 
not worker skill. Conversely, other 
commenters claimed that the proposed 
weighted selection process would 
benefit companies in lower-cost areas 
while hurting startups and other tech 
companies in high-cost hubs like 
Silicon Valley, with one commenter 
stating that pushing talent away from 
such hubs would make these regions 
less globally competitive. 
Some commenters wrote that the rule 
would exacerbate existing regional 
economic imbalances by concentrating 
talent in a few major metropolitan areas 
and leaving rural areas with talent 
shortages. Multiple commenters said 
companies in rural areas providing 
competitive wages for their location are 
disadvantaged against employers in 
high-cost metropolitan areas that can 
offer higher wages. Some commenters 
also remarked that the proposed rule 
would leave rural areas underserved 
and exacerbate economic inequality. A 
commenter wrote that the proposed rule 
would undermine the ‘‘billions of 
dollars’’ the United States has invested 
into encouraging regional development 
in smaller cities. Another commenter 
said that the proposed rule would create 
severe economic disruptions in regions 
that have built their economies around 
industries that depend on international 
talent by restricting the flow of such 
talent. 
Response: DHS does not believe that this rule will necessarily disadvantage 
certain geographic regions as compared 
with others. As with all other cap- 
subject H–1B registrations (or petitions), 
DHS will weight registrations for these 
positions generally according to the 
highest OEWS prevailing wage level 
that the proffered wage equals or 
exceeds, which necessarily takes into 
account the area of intended 
employment. In other words, under this 
rule, registrations corresponding to the 
same wage level will be weighted the 
same regardless of whether their 
proffered wages are different owing to 
their areas of intended employment. 
This final rule neutralizes geographic 
differences in salary amounts by taking 
into account the area of intended 
employment when weighting 
registrations. DHS therefore does not 
agree that this rule would disadvantage 
certain geographic regions, exacerbate 
existing regional economic imbalances, 
or undermine regional development. 
With respect to the commenter’s 
concern about regions with economies 
built around specific industries that 
depend on international talent, DHS 
disagrees that this rule would restrict 
the flow of such talent. Instead, the rule 
will generally favor the allocation of H– 
1B visas to higher-skilled and higher- 
paid aliens, while maintaining the 
opportunity for employers to secure H– 
1B workers at all wage levels. 
15. Negative Impacts on Mixed 
Compensation Models 
Comment: Commenters expressed concern that a wage-based selection 
process does not consider all aspects of 
compensation. A commenter pointed 
out that while the OEWS data takes into 
account a range of other types of pay 
(such as commission, cost-of living 
allowance, hazard pay, incentive pay, 
piece rate, production bonus, and tips,) 
employers are only allowed to use the 
base wages when complying with wage 
requirements in the H–1B program. 
Commenters wrote that an employee’s 
pay can go beyond base pay and can 
include: bonuses, equity, benefits, 
commission, cost-of-living allowance, 
deadheading pay, guaranteed pay, 
hazard pay, incentive pay, longevity 
pay, over-the-road pay, piece rate, 
portal-to-portal pay, production bonus, 
and tips, with some commenters noting 
that such incentives may vary by 
industry. Other commenters expressed 
concern that small businesses and 
startups, which often rely on equity 
compensation, future profit 
participation, or stock options rather 
than high salaries, would be particularly 
disadvantaged. Some commenters said 
that if only base salary is considered, it 
would not provide a standardized 
comparison and could distort the H–1B 
selection process. 
Some commenters remarked that 
employers relying on equity-based pay 
may appear to offer lower wages despite 
competitive packages and cautioned 
that these employers could inflate base 
salaries without improving total 
compensation, potentially distorting the 
system. Similarly, a commenter 
remarked that the proposed rule would 
overlook the challenge of adjudicating 
disputes about compensation packages 
that include bonuses, equity, or other 
non-cash benefits. The commenter 
stated that because the system privileges 
base salary alone, employers will be 
incentivized to overstate base pay on 
paper while cutting back on other 
components of total compensation. The 
commenter expressed concern that this 
creates enforcement disputes that USCIS 
is ill-equipped to resolve at scale. 
Some commenters suggested that DHS 
could improve the system by 
incorporating total compensation, 
including the cash value of stock and 
bonuses. A commenter suggested that if 
wages are considered, it would make 
sense to consider past Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) transcripts of candidates to 
get a more complete picture of 
compensation. 
Response: DHS recognizes that companies may offer various forms of 
pay and benefits provided as 
compensation for services, such as cash 
bonuses, stock options, paid insurance, 
retirement and savings plans, and profit- 
sharing plans. While cash bonuses may, 
in limited circumstances, be counted 
towards the annual salary (see 20 CFR VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:36 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\29DER2.SGM 29DER2

higher wages than jobs that require few skills and 
little education.’’). See also ‘‘Wage Methodology for 
the Temporary Non-Agricultural Employment H–2B

occupations that require sophisticated skills and 
training receive higher wages based on those 
skills.’’); Daniel Costa & Ron Hira, Economic Policy

655.731(c)(2)), other forms of benefits, 
such as stock options, profit sharing 
plans, and flexible work schedules may 
not be readily quantifiable or 
guaranteed, which means that they 
cannot reliably be calculated into 
proffered wages. While this may affect 
some petitioners and beneficiaries 
negatively, DHS does not believe there 
is a viable alternative that could 
consider all of the various forms of 
compensation that companies may offer 
that could be implemented in an 
uncomplicated and predictable way. 
Additionally, DOL regulations define 
payment of wages for purposes of 
satisfying the H–1B required wage. See 
20 CFR 655.731(c)(2). This rule does not 
change how wages are defined or 
measured. Regarding the suggestion to 
consider past IRS transcripts of 
candidates, DHS notes that proffered 
wages at the time of registration and 
petition filing generally relate to future 
employment, so it is unclear what 
purpose transcripts or other IRS 
documentation of prospective 
employees would serve. 
16. General Concerns on Wage-Based 
Selection 
Comment: Many commenters said that wage is not a proxy for experience, 
skill, or education and that the rule 
erroneously assumes those who earn 
more contribute more to the economy or 
society. Other commenters stated the 
proposed rule would significantly 
reduce the chances of obtaining an H– 
1B visa in entrepreneurial, academic, 
and research spaces which would 
restrict access to international workers 
with specialized skills in these areas. 
Other commenters said that the new 
system would disadvantage top earners, 
as a highly paid individual with a level 
I wage in a high-earning field would be 
ranked lower than someone who earns 
far less as a level IV in a lower-earning 
field. Commenters also stated that the 
proposed rule would favor only 
experienced, high-paid workers and big 
firms, while shutting out early-career 
professionals and the startups, 
healthcare institutions, and research 
sectors that rely on them. One 
commenter said that by conflating wage 
level with skill and innovation 
potential, DHS would systematically 
disadvantage the early-career talent 
pipeline that drives technological 
breakthroughs. Another commenter 
stated that the proposed weighted 
selection process does not account for a 
level IV H–1B employee who may be 
laid off and may need to accept a bridge 
job at level II or III, putting their status 
in jeopardy. 
Response: DHS disagrees with these comments and believes that salary 
generally is a reasonable proxy for skill 
level.
44
DHS believes that an employer 
who offers a higher wage than required 
by the prevailing wage level does so 
because that higher wage is a clear 
reflection of the beneficiary’s value to 
the employer, which reflects the unique 
qualities the beneficiary possesses. DHS 
does not believe this rule will favor 
certain high paying professions or 
companies, because the rule takes into 
account wage level relative to the SOC 
code when weighting registrations (or 
petitions). Additionally, DHS recognizes 
that this rule will decrease the chance 
of H–1B cap selection for jobs with a 
proffered wage that corresponds to a 
level I wage, but it does not shut out 
early-career professionals. As stated in 
the NPRM and throughout this final 
rule, DHS recognizes the value in 
maintaining the opportunity for 
employers to secure H–1B workers at all 
wage levels. DHS also disagrees with the 
concern that wage levels are inadequate 
to compare workers across occupations 
as this rule is designed to generally 
favor the allocation of H–1B visas to 
higher-skilled and higher-paid aliens, 
while ensuring meaningful 
opportunities for selection regardless of 
industry or profession. 
DHS also does not believe that this 
rule will disadvantage particular 
industries or employers based on 
geography, size, or other factors. Wage 
levels already account for these factors 
by taking into account the area of 
intended employment and SOC code. 
While the weighted selection process 
may not account for every scenario, 
such as a laid-off worker taking a 
temporary lower paying job, DHS 
believes that this is a rare scenario and 
is unable to provide for every possible 
scenario when implementing a 
weighting process that is uncomplicated 
and predictable for prospective 
petitioners. Further, DHS believes that 
the advantages of the new selection 
process and the benefits it will bring to 
the economy overall outweigh any 
possible disadvantages that may occur 
in rare cases. 
17. Concerns With the OEWS Program 
Comment: Several commenters expressed concern with using the OEWS 
program. For instance, a commenter 
noted that the rule relied on faulty wage 
level assumptions in using the OEWS 
data and said that the OEWS wage 
survey, on which H–1B wage levels are 
based, was never intended to measure 
skill or productivity. The commenter 
explained that its purpose is to 
represent mean and percentile wage 
distributions within occupational codes, 
and it makes no adjustment for the 
employer’s industry, business model, or 
regional cost factors. The commenter 
said that the proposed rule’s assumption 
that positions commanding a wage that 
corresponds to a level IV wage represent 
the ‘‘most skilled’’ workers ignores the 
structural wage differentials that exist 
across industries. The commenter notes 
that DOL’s OEWS data aggregate wages 
across all employers within an 
occupation, without adjusting for the 
profit structure, funding model, or 
public versus private character of the 
employer, and that the wage levels are 
based primarily on statistical percentiles 
of pay, not individualized measures of 
experience. As a result, the proposed 
weighted selection process risks 
granting preferential treatment to junior 
employees in lucrative markets over 
experienced professionals in essential 
but lower-paying fields, such as 
education, public health, and 
infrastructure engineering. Similarly, 
several commenters stated that wage 
levels are inadequate to compare 
workers across occupations. 
A commenter also expressed concern 
with wage inflation, noting that it 
reflects market conditions rather than 
skill increases. The commenter noted 
that some areas, such as technology, 
finance, and law have seen wage 
inflation in recent years, where 
compensation has escalated due to 
market competition rather than 
measurable increases in skill and the 
proposed weighted selection process 
would reward industries that can inflate 
salaries fastest, not those that develop or 
employ the most capable workers. Other 
commenters stated that the selection 
process artificially inflates the chances 
of roles requiring less training, 
experience, or responsibility. 
Response: DHS appreciates these concerns but maintains that salary 
generally is a reasonable proxy for skill

45
While DHS is aware that some 
structural wage differentials may exist 
across industries, DHS is not aware of 
an efficient and uncomplicated way to 
incorporate such differentials into the 
OEWS wage system or to otherwise 
account for these differentials when 
weighting and selecting registrations or 
petitions. Similarly, DHS is not aware of 
an alternate program (other than OEWS) 
that would consider such unique factors 
as individualized experience and wage 
inflation. While no data set is perfect, 
the OEWS data represents the best 
available resource for this purpose. DHS 
favors using the OEWS wage level 
system because it is already used in the 
H–1B program, widely recognized, 
publicly available, and updated 
annually by DOL. DHS intentionally 
chose a selection methodology that used 
information and resources already 
familiar to most petitioners and 
stakeholders. Utilizing OEWS wage 
levels allows USCIS to leverage 
employers’ existing knowledge of the 
wage levels in order to implement the 
weighted selection process. Employers 
are already required to complete LCAs 
and access OEWS wage information or 
alternative wage sources. This rule 
simply requires that the employer will 
look at the wage they are offering the 
alien and, when OEWS wage level is 
available, select the wage level that 
corresponds to that offered wage for the 
offered position’s SOC codes and 
metropolitan statistical area (MSA). 
Although OEWS does not collect 
information on skill or experience 
levels, DHS believes it is reasonable to 
use features of the OEWS wage 
distribution as a proxy for those 
variables. If OEWS wage level is 
unavailable, the employer determines 
the wage level using the DOL guidance 
that the employer would otherwise 
follow when determining the relevant 
wage level to select on the LCA. 
Comment: A commenter expressed concern that the rule would create 
confusion between the wage level 
offered for USCIS purposes and the 
wage level required under DOL rules. 
The commenter noted that if a petitioner 
decides to pay a beneficiary a higher 
wage level than what is required under 
DOL rules for a better chance at 
selection (such as a level IV wage), then 
the prevailing wage level indicated in 
its registration submitted to USCIS will 
not match the prevailing wage level 
indicated on its LCA submitted with the 
petition (which may have been a level 
I wage). The commenter stated that at 
minimum, USCIS should refine 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(1) to make clear that 
the actual LCA submitted with an H–1B 
petition should still calculate the 
prevailing wage based upon existing 
DOL rules, and the offered wage listed 
in the registration is to be used solely 
for determining the weighting of the 
lottery entry. 
Response: As clearly stated in the NPRM, a registrant is required to select 
the box for the highest OEWS wage level 
(‘‘wage level IV,’’ ‘‘wage level III,’’ 
‘‘wage level II,’’ or ‘‘wage level I’’) that 
the beneficiary’s proffered wage 
generally equals or exceeds for the 
relevant SOC code in the area(s) of 
intended employment. 90 FR 45986, 
45992 (Sept. 24, 2025). DHS does not 
agree that this is confusing. Conversely, 
DHS believes it would be confusing to 
add language in 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(1) that discusses how 
to calculate the prevailing wage under 
DOL rules since this provision is about 
filing procedures with USCIS. 
18. Other Opposition 
Comment: A commenter expressed concern that the rule allows the 
government to manipulate market-based 
wages through the use of immigration 
policy, saying this rule establishes 
‘‘dangerous precedents for government 
wage determination.’’ The commenter 
claimed that this represents ‘‘a 
fundamental departure from how the 
United States has historically 
approached labor markets,’’ and noted 
that in the labor market, wages are 
primarily determined through 
negotiations between employers and 
workers. While the commenter 
acknowledged that the government is 
justified in ensuring fair wages for U.S. 
workers and H–1B workers, the 
commenter concluded that the proposed 
weighted selection system goes beyond 
these legitimate interests into 
government intervention in market- 
based wages. 
Response: DHS disagrees with this commenter. This rule merely fills in a 
statutory gap regarding how to 
administer the H–1B numerical 
allocations in years of excess demand, 
consistent with DHS’s statutory 
authority to determine the form and 
manner of submitting H–1B petitions 
and the administration of the H–1B 
numerical allocations. See INA secs. 103(a) and 214(c)(1), 8 U.S.C. 1103(a) 
and 1184(c)(1). This rule does not 
constitute government intervention in 
market-based wages. Through this rule, 
DHS is not mandating what wages 
employers must pay their employees. 
Employers that wish to participate in 
the H–1B program may be incentivized 
to offer higher wages to their 
prospective H–1B workers in order to 
increase their chances of selection 
under the cap, but they remain free to 
determine what wages they want to offer 
prospective H–1B employees. 
Employers also remain free to choose 
not to participate in the H–1B program. 
Further, this rule does not represent 
‘‘government intervention’’ in the labor 
market nor a ‘‘fundamental departure 
from how the United States has 
historically approached labor markets,’’ 
as the commenter claimed. In order to 
participate in the H–1B program, 
employers have always had to meet 
certain wage requirements, including 
prevailing wage requirements as 
determined by DOL and other generally 
applicable Federal and state wage 
requirements. See 20 CFR 655.40. It is therefore unclear what the commenter 
means by claiming that this rule would 
establish ‘‘dangerous precedents for 
government wage determination’’ when 
various government agencies routinely 
regulate an employer’s wage obligations 
and given that this rule does not 
mandate what wages employers must 
pay their employees. 
Comment: A few commenters discussed how the proposed rule would 
unfairly and disproportionately harm 
certain minority groups. Some of these 
commenters specifically noted the 
disproportionate impact on Asian and 
Pacific Islander groups, pointing out 
that Asian workers account for the 
majority of H–1B workers in the United 
States. Another commenter said that the 
rule would have a disparate impact on 
Hispanic groups, claiming that the rule 
would deepen existing racial wealth 
disparities. 
Response: DHS disagrees that this rule will unfairly impact certain minority 
groups or deepen racial wealth 
disparities. This rule does not target or 
favor any particular minority group. 
This rule merely increases the chance of 
selection for aliens who will be paid a 
wage that corresponds to a higher wage 
level, regardless of their race, ethnicity, 
or country of origin.

Background 
1. Statutory Authority 
Comment: Several commenters supported the rule, saying that the 
changes to H–1B selection are consistent 
with statutory language. Commenters 
stated that the statutory language is 
ambiguous and silent as to how visas 
should be allocated if they cannot be 
issued in the order that they were filed, 
and that the proposed wage level 
weighting scheme is reasonable and 
within DHS’s authority. Some 
commenters agreed that DHS has the 
authority to determine how the 
government selects H–1B petitions 
when they receive more petitions than 
available visas. 
Response: DHS agrees that the statute is silent as to how USCIS must select H– 
1B petitions, or registrations, to be filed 
toward the numerical allocations in 
years of excess demand; the term ‘‘filed’’ 
as used in INA sec. 214(g)(3), 8 U.S.C. 
1184(g)(3), is ambiguous;
46
and these 
changes are reasonable and within 
DHS’s general authority. See INA secs. 103(a), 214(a), and (c)(1), 8 U.S.C. 
1103(a), 1184(a), and (c)(1). 
Comment: Some commenters said the proposed rule would violate the INA, 
which prioritizes the selection of H–1B 
cap-subject petitions in the ‘‘order in 
which they are filed,’’ and that USCIS 
lacks the statutory authority for the 
proposed weighted selection process. 
Some commenters stated that the INA 
says that DHS ‘‘shall’’ issue visas in the 
order in which they are filed, 
underscoring that this is a statutory 
mandate not subject to DHS’s discretion. 
Commenters stated that, while the 
random lottery is permissible, there is 
nothing in the statute allowing for wage- 
based prioritization and thus the 
proposed rule exceeds DHS’s statutory 
authority. Commenters remarked that 
INA sec. 214(g) is silent on allocation 
methods beyond random selection, and 
that USCIS cannot use the statute’s 
silence as an invitation to adopt wage- 
or skill-based criteria. Echoing other 
commenters’ concerns about DHS’s lack 
of statutory authority for the rule, some 
commenters added that an executive 
action like the one proposed in the 
NPRM would require legislative action 
or approval by Congress. Commenters 
stated that the Executive Branch does 
not have ‘‘plenary authority’’ and there 
are processes in place to amend laws. 
A commenter said the rule is ultra 
vires because it improperly changes the 
process and adds new requirements to 
the selection order for H–1B cap subject 
petitions that exceed what is clearly 
stated in the INA. The commenter cited 
INA sec. 214(g)(3), which states: 
Individuals subject to H–1B numerical 
limitations ‘‘. . . shall be issued visas 
(or otherwise provided nonimmigrant 
status) in the order in which petitions 
are filed for such visas or status.’’ 
Pointing out that Congress did not 
change this section when it amended it 
through the H–1B Visa Reform Act of 
2004, the commenter asserted that the 
proposal to add the wage level element 
violates clear congressional intent. The 
commenter added that the well- 
established principle of law remains 
that an agency cannot modify a statute 
by regulation, and that since the statute 
is neither ambiguous nor silent, 
Congress did not leave a gap for USCIS 
interpretation via regulation. The 
commenter added that it is particularly 
telling that the agency previously 
evaluated this very issue in January 
2019 and concluded that the INA is 
clear and does not permit the type of 
prioritization it proposes here.
47
The 
commenter asserted that USCIS cites no 
congressional intent relating to the H– 
1B numerical cap and its justification 
and reasoning lacks analysis from 
official research or studies by 
government agencies. 
Several other commenters also noted 
that DHS previously determined in its 
2019 rule, Registration Requirement for 
Petitioners Seeking to File H–1B 
Petitions on Behalf of Cap-Subject 
Aliens, that prioritization based on 
salary would require statutory changes. 
Some commenters said that senators 
introduced bipartisan legislation four 
days after the publication of this 
proposed rule to authorize DHS to 
process H–1B petitions on proffered 
wages, and commented that Congress 
would not be legislating on this exact 
issue if it thought DHS could implement 
these changes to the H–1B program on 
its own. 
Some commenters wrote that the 
Supreme Court’s 2024 overruling of the 
Chevron framework eliminated the judicial deference to agencies in 
Administrative Procedure Act (APA) 
rulemaking. A commenter noted that 
since the 2024 Supreme Court decision 
in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, Chevron deference has been 
overturned, ‘‘thereby removing the 
power of administrative agencies to 
interpret ambiguous statutes.’’ 
Similarly, another commenter stated 
that the proposed rule would go beyond 
the discretion afforded by Congress and 
that USCIS discretion is constrained by 
Loper Bright such that USCIS may not 
simply use its preferred interpretation of 
‘‘filing’’ under that statute, but instead 
must use ‘‘the best’’ interpretation, as 
any other interpretation is 
impermissible. The same commenter 
indicated support for the 
Administration’s goal of prioritizing 
high-skilled immigration, but stated that 
USCIS’ obligation to administer the INA 
does not give USCIS the flexibility to 
select applicants in the manner 
proposed by this rule. 
Response: DHS disagrees with the commenters’ assertions that the 
weighted selection process would 
violate the INA or that DHS lacks the 
statutory authority to implement a 
weighted selection process. The statute 
is silent as to how USCIS must select H– 
1B petitions, or registrations, to be filed 
toward the numerical allocations in 
years of excess demand; the term ‘‘filed’’ 
as used in INA sec. 214(g)(3), 8 U.S.C. 
1184(g)(3), is ambiguous;
48
and these 
changes are reasonable and within 
DHS’s general authority. See INA secs. 103(a), 214(a), and (c)(1), 8 U.S.C. 
1103(a), 1184(a), and (c)(1). 
Excess demand for numerically 
limited H–1B cap numbers created a 
rush of simultaneous submissions at the 
beginning of each H–1B cap petition 
period, preventing application of the 
numerical limitations based solely on 
the order in which the petitions are 
received by USCIS. See Liu v. Mayorkas, 588 F. Supp. 3d 43, 48 (D.D.C. 2022) 
(discussing the high demand for H–1B 
visas, the operational challenges USCIS 
faced administering the H–1B cap 
because of the high demand, and the 
creation of the registration requirement). 
DHS acknowledges that Congress 
directed DHS to process earlier-filed 
petitions before later-filed petitions, see 
INA sec. 214(g)(3), 8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(3) 
(stating that aliens who are subject to 
the numerical limitations will be 
‘‘issued visas (or otherwise provided 
nonimmigrant status) in the order in 
which the petitions are filed’’),

application would necessarily mean that processing 
delays pertaining to a petition earlier in the petition 
filing order would preclude issuance of a visa or 
provision of status to all other H–1B petitions later 
in the petition filing order.’’ Therefore, USCIS’ 
‘‘longstanding approach to implementing the 
numerical limitation has been to project the number 
of petitions needed to reach the numerical 
limitation. . . .’’). 
50
See Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 395 (2024) (explaining that a statute’s meaning 
may be that the agency is authorized to exercise a 
degree of discretion and empowered to prescribe 
rules to fill in statutory gaps based on ‘‘reasoned 
decision making’’); see also Liu v. Mayorkas, 588 F. Supp. 3d 43, 55 (D.D.C. 2022) (finding that the 
registration requirement does not violate the INA, 
is not ultra vires, and that registration is merely ‘‘an 
antecedent procedural step to be eligible to file an 
H–1B cap[-subject] petition’’); Walker Macy LLC v. 
USCIS, 243 F. Supp. 3d 1156 (D. Or. 2017). 51
DHS notes that the registration process, like the 
petition process that applies when registration is 
suspended, faithfully implements INA sec. 
214(g)(3), 8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(3) by, among other 
things, ensuring that earlier-filed registrations and 
petitions receive priority over later ones. For 
instance, in addition to allowing for a more efficient 
administration of the annual numerical allocations, 
the process accounts for the possibility that DHS 
will receive an insufficient number of 
simultaneously submitted registrations during the 
initial registration to meet the H–1B regular cap; in 
such a circumstance, registration will remain open 
until USCIS has received a sufficient number of 
registrations for unique beneficiaries to meet the 
cap. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(5)(i); see also 84 FR 896 (Jan. 31, 2019) (explaining that, where an 
insufficient number of registrations have been 
received during the initial registration period, 
USCIS would select all of the registrations properly 
submitted during the initial registration period, and 
that registrations submitted after the initial 
registration would continue to be selected on a 
rolling basis until such time as a sufficient number 
of registrations have been received).

performance (last visited Nov. 24, 2025). Congress did not define what it means 
to ‘‘file’’ a petition, or how to order 
petitions that are filed during the same 
timeframe. 
The Secretary has broad authority to 
administer and enforce the INA, 
establish such regulations as the 
Secretary deems necessary for carrying 
out such authority, and to prescribe the 
time and conditions under which an 
alien may be admitted to the United 
States as a nonimmigrant and how an 
importing employer may petition for 
nonimmigrant workers. See INA secs. 103(a), 214(a)(1), and 214(c)(1), 8 U.S.C. 
1103(a), 1184(a)(1), and (c)(1). Such 
authority includes prescribing rules to 
fill statutory gaps.
50
 
DHS has leveraged these authorities to 
make significant improvements to the 
H–1B selection process over the years in 
response to the high demand, consistent 
with the purpose and structure of the 
annual numerical limitations. The 
registration process, for instance, selects 
among ‘‘registrations submitted 
electronically over a designated period 
of time to ensure the fair and orderly 
administration of the numerical 
allocations.’’ 84 FR 896 (Jan. 31, 2019).
51
 
DHS’s random selection process is a 
similar type of gap-filling measure. 
When this process was previously 
challenged, DHS prevailed.
52
The court 
observed that ‘‘[i]t is not difficult to 
envision a scenario where many more 
petitions arrive on the final receipt date 
than are needed to fill the statutory cap, 
and processing them ‘in order’ . . . may 
also be random and arbitrary.’’
53
This 
court importantly held that ‘‘Congress 
left to the discretion of USCIS how to 
handle simultaneous submissions’’ and 
‘‘USCIS has discretion to decide how 
best to order those petitions.’’
54
In 
short, DHS has authority to engage in 
reasoned decision making with regard to 
how to administer the H–1B petitioning 
process (including whether to require a 
registration process as an antecedent 
procedural step to be eligible to file an 
H–1B cap-subject petition), and how to 
best select among simultaneously 
submitted H–1B registrations or 
petitions.
55
Congress provided DHS 
with the authority to better ensure a fair, 
orderly, and efficient allocation of H–1B 
cap numbers based on reasoned 
decision making, including 
consideration of the overall statutory 
scheme and purpose of the 
classification: the selection of highly 
skilled and highly paid nonimmigrants 
in the United States while protecting the 
wages, working conditions and job 
opportunities of U.S. workers. 
DHS acknowledges that it has 
implemented regulations over the years 
that provide for a random selection from 
all petitions or registrations that occur 
within a certain timeframe. See, e.g.,70 
FR 23775 (May 5, 2005), 84 FR 888 (Jan. 
31, 2019). However, while the current 
random selection of petitions or 
registrations is reasonable, DHS believes 
it is neither the optimal, nor the 
exclusive method of selecting 
registrations or petitions toward the 
numerical allocations when more 
registrations or petitions, as applicable, 
are simultaneously submitted than 
projected as needed to reach the 
numerical allocations. Pure 
randomization does not serve the ends 
of the H–1B program or congressional 
intent to help U.S. employers fill labor 
shortages in positions requiring highly 
skilled workers.
56
Under the current 
random selection process, in every fiscal 
year from FY 2019 through FY 2024, 
petitions for beneficiaries at wage level 
III and wage level IV were the least 
represented among all wage levels in 
cap-subject H–1B filings, both under the 
regular cap and the advanced-degree 
exemption.
57
 
Regarding the comments that 
referenced recently proposed legislation 
to support assertions that this rule 
exceeds DHS’s authority, DHS notes that 
proposed legislation that is not enacted 
is not a reliable indicator of 
congressional intent, particularly as it 
pertains to previously enacted 
legislation. See Red Lion Broadcasting v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 381 n.11 (1969) (‘‘unsuccessful attempts at legislation 
are not the best of guides to legislative 
intent.’’). 
Regarding commenters’ assertions that 
the statute is neither ambiguous nor 
silent on allocation methods beyond 
random selection, DHS observes that the 
statute does not expressly refer to 
allocation by random selection or 
address how the numerical allocations 
should be administered when demand 
exceeds the available supply of H–1B 
visa numbers. Rather, that is the silence 
that DHS permissibly filled in prior 
rules providing for random selection, 
and is the same silence that DHS is 
permissibly filling in this final rule by 
implementing a reasonable selection 
process, consistent with a key goal of 
the program: protecting the wages, 
working conditions, and job 
opportunities of U.S. workers. 
DHS recognizes that it considered the 
issue of cap selection by wage level in 
2019 and concluded at that time that 
prioritization by wage level or other 
bases would require statutory change. 
DHS acknowledged that prior statement 
in footnote 20 in the preamble to the 
proposed rule. 90 FR 45986, 45990 
(Sept. 24, 2025). DHS reconsidered the 
analysis as far back as 2020, and again

determined that selection by wage level 
is consistent with its broad statutory 
authority and fills a statutory gap in a 
way that is consistent with a key goal 
of the program. 
2. Congressional Intent 
Comment: Commenters stated that the wage-based system is reasonable 
because it is consistent with the intent 
of the H–1B program, which is to help 
U.S. businesses obtain highly skilled 
foreign workers to supplement the 
domestic workforce. Some commenters 
said that a weighted, wage-based 
selection process would better reflect 
the statutory intent to admit ‘‘highly 
skilled’’ workers and help mitigate 
negative labor market impacts. 
Response: DHS agrees with these comments that the rule is consistent 
with congressional intent and statutory 
language; the statute is silent as to how 
USCIS must select H–1B petitions, or 
registrations, to be filed toward the 
numerical allocations in years of excess 
demand; the term ‘‘filed’’ as used in INA 
sec. 214(g)(3), 8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(3), is 
ambiguous; and these changes are 
reasonable and within DHS’s general 
authority. DHS, therefore, is relying on 
its general statutory authority to 
implement an H–1B cap selection 
process that prioritizes selection 
generally based on the highest 
prevailing wage level that a proffered 
wage equals or exceeds. See INA secs. 103(a), 214(a), and (c)(1), 8 U.S.C. 
1103(a), 1184(a), and (c)(1). 
Comment: Some commenters wrote that the proposed weighted selection 
process would violate the clear 
congressional intent of the H–1B 
program—to fill existing gaps in the 
U.S. labor supply in specialized fields. 
One commenter said Congress 
deliberately chose prescriptive statutory 
language that forecloses the type of 
‘‘executive branch creativity’’ proposed 
in this rule. Another commenter said 
that the rule’s weighted selection 
process would transform the 
congressionally established H–1B 
program into a wage-based preference 
system, for which there is no basis in 
the text of the INA. 
Some commenters wrote that 
Congress designed the H–1B program to 
be accessible across wage levels, and 
that the current random lottery reflects 
congressional intent for fairness and 
equal opportunity. A comment from 
multiple organizations stated that 
Congress and DOL designed the system 
to ensure wage parity within an 
occupation and within a local labor 
market, not to stack-rank different 
workers. Some commenters said that the 
H–1B program was created to give U.S. 
employers access to specialized workers 
across all experience levels, and that the 
NPRM would undermine that purpose. 
Another commenter wrote that the INA 
requires USCIS to implement a ‘‘fair’’ 
selection process when petitions exceed 
the visa cap, and suggested that the 
proposed selection process would fail to 
meet this requirement by 
disproportionately disfavoring early- 
career workers. A commenter wrote that 
the H–1B program has ‘‘drifted far from 
its congressional intent’’ and 
fundamental reforms are needed to 
ensure the visa holders are not used to 
replace U.S. workers with ‘‘cheaper 
foreign labor.’’ 
Some commenters wrote that DHS’s 
proposed weighting toward more skilled 
workers directly conflicts with the 
statutory definition of ‘‘specialty 
occupation,’’ which is defined in terms 
of a minimum requirement of a 
bachelor’s degree for entry into the 
occupation, and does not depend on an 
experience requirement. One of the 
commenters said that DHS has no 
authority to enact its policy preference 
for admitting H–1B workers based on 
their experience as a deciding factor in 
selecting their registrations as it is 
contrary to the statutory definition. 
Another commenter wrote that the 
NPRM is ‘‘unjustified’’ in its citation to 
6 U.S.C. 111(b)(1)(E) as one of its legal 
bases. The commenter asserted that this 
provision was intended as a constraint 
on DHS’s regulatory power, and that it 
obligates DHS ‘‘to avoid initiatives that 
would weaken economic stability or 
burden lawful sectors of American 
commerce.’’ The commenter suggested 
that the proposed rule conflicts with 
this limitation by diminishing, rather 
than safeguarding, the nation’s overall 
economic security. The commenter 
stated that because the rule ‘‘constrains 
U.S. employers’ ability to access 
specialized talent,’’ it undermines the 
statutory mission Congress assigned to 
DHS. 
Response: DHS disagrees with the commenters’ assertions that the 
weighted selection process would 
violate the INA or that DHS lacks the 
statutory authority to implement a 
weighted selection process. The statute 
is silent as to how USCIS must select H– 
1B petitions, or registrations, to be filed 
toward the numerical allocations in 
years of excess demand; the term ‘‘filed’’ 
as used in INA sec. 214(g)(3), 8 U.S.C. 
1184(g)(3), is ambiguous;
58
and these 
changes are reasonable and within 
DHS’s general authority. See INA secs. 103(a), 214(a), and (c)(1), 8 U.S.C. 
1103(a), 1184(a), and (c)(1). 
While the current random selection of 
petitions or registrations is reasonable, 
DHS believes it is neither the optimal, 
nor the exclusive method of selecting 
registrations or petitions toward the 
numerical allocations when more 
registrations or petitions, as applicable, 
are simultaneously submitted than 
projected as needed to reach the 
numerical allocations. Pure 
randomization does not serve the ends 
of the H–1B program or congressional 
intent to help U.S. employers fill labor 
shortages in positions requiring highly 
skilled workers.
59
Under the current 
random selection process, in every fiscal 
year from FY 2019 through FY 2024, 
petitions for beneficiaries at wage level 
III and wage level IV were the least 
represented among all wage levels in 
cap-subject H–1B filings, both under the 
regular cap and the advanced-degree 
exemption.
60
 
Contrary to commenters’ assertions, 
the weighted selection process does not 
preclude access to skilled workers at the 
lower wage levels or diminish, rather 
than safeguard, the nation’s overall 
economic security. Congress imposed an 
annual numerical limitation on the 
number of foreign workers who may be 
issued an initial H–1B visa or otherwise 
provided initial H–1B status. See INA sec. 214(g)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(1)(A). 
Congress, however, ‘‘left to the 
discretion of USCIS how to handle 
simultaneous submissions’’ and ‘‘USCIS 
has discretion to decide how best to 
order those petitions.’’
61
As DHS 
explained in the preamble to the 
proposed rule (90 FR 45991 (Sept. 24, 
2025)), by engaging in a wage-level- 
based weighting of registrations for 
unique beneficiaries, DHS will better 
ensure that initial H–1B visas and status 
grants would more likely go to the 
highest skilled or highest paid 
beneficiaries, while not effectively 
precluding those at lower wage levels.

skilled workers ‘‘would benefit the 
economy and increase the United States’

3. Previous H–1B Rulemakings and 
Related Court Cases 
Comment: A commenter wrote that DHS attempted to make a similar change 
in 2021 and it was vacated by a Federal 
court in Chamber of Commerce v. DHS, No. 4:20–cv–07331, 2021 WL 4198518 
(N.D. Cal. Sept. 15, 2021), adding that 
DHS has not explained how the 
approach described in the NPRM would 
avoid the same legal defects of that 
previous rule. Another commenter 
similarly stated that wage-based 
selection policies have faced legal 
challenges in the past, raising 
significant questions about the statutory 
authority for such a weighted selection 
process. Commenters stated that this 
rule would similarly likely face legal 
challenges. One commenter said that 
DHS should withdraw the rule to avoid 
litigation. 
Some commenters wrote that while 
the Walker Macy court decision upheld USCIS’ use of a random lottery for 
simultaneously submitted petitions, it 
does not support introducing wage- 
based preference as a new requirement 
to determine eligibility or priority. Some 
commenters wrote that the proposed 
rule improperly cites Liu v. Mayorkas.63
 
One of these commenters asserted that 
Liu ‘‘does not support the agency’s proposed imposition of a thumb-on-the- 
scale lottery system based on wage 
levels,’’ and in any case cannot be relied 
upon because it is a single, nonbinding 
district court decision and not 
controlling law. The commenter added 
that the court described the lottery as an 
antecedent measure that did not replace 
the statutory requirement of 
chronological allocation; rather, it was a 
preliminary step taken before the 
chronological allocation process begins. 
Another commenter reasoned that Liu v. Mayorkas only addressed the narrow challenge to online registration system 
implementation and the prevention of 
multiple filings, and therefore that using 
Liu to justify the significant shift to an unequal, wage-based weighted lottery 
expands beyond precedent and what the 
INA mandates. The commenter added 
that Liu specifically warned that agency discretion must adhere to statutory 
language and purpose. 
One commenter asserted that this 
rulemaking represents a ‘‘premature 
departure’’ from the 2024 final rule. 89 
FR 7456 (Feb. 2, 2024). The commenter 
noted that the 2024 final rule was 
designed to reduce ‘‘gaming’’ the system 
to ensure that each beneficiary has the 
same chance of selection and said that 
it is premature to change that framework 
before evaluating outcomes across the 
FY 2025 and FY 2026 cycles. 
Response: DHS notes that the court in Chamber of Commerce v. DHS, No. 4:20–cv–07331, 2021 WL 4198518 (N.D. 
Cal. Sept. 15, 2021), did not reach the 
issue of DHS’s statutory interpretation 
and the substantive merits of the 2021 
H–1B Selection Final Rule. Because the 
court did not reach the substantive 
merits of that rulemaking, DHS 
disagrees with the commenter’s 
assertion that the 2021 H–1B Selection 
Final Rule was inconsistent with DHS’s 
statutory authority or that DHS has not 
sufficiently explained how this current 
rulemaking is consistent with DHS’s 
statutory authority. 
DHS also disagrees with the 
commenters’ assertions that the 
weighted selection process would 
violate the INA or that DHS lacks the 
statutory authority to implement a 
weighted selection process. The statute 
is silent as to how USCIS must select H– 
1B petitions, or registrations, to be filed 
toward the numerical allocations in 
years of excess demand; the term ‘‘filed’’ 
as used in INA sec. 214(g)(3), 8 U.S.C. 
1184(g)(3), is ambiguous;
64
and these 
changes are reasonable and within 
DHS’s general authority. See INA secs. 103(a), 214(a), and (c)(1), 8 U.S.C. 
1103(a), 1184(a), and (c)(1). 
The Secretary has broad authority to 
administer and enforce the INA, 
establish such regulations as the 
Secretary deems necessary for carrying 
out such authority, and to prescribe the 
time and conditions under which an 
alien may be admitted to the United 
States as a nonimmigrant and how an 
importing employer may petition for 
nonimmigrant workers. See INA secs. 103(a), 214(a)(1), and (c)(1), 8 U.S.C. 
1103(a), 1184(a)(1), and (c)(1). Such 
authority includes prescribing rules to 
fill statutory gaps.
65
 
DHS disagrees with the commenters’ 
assertion that Liu was improperly cited in the proposed rule. The Liu decision, while not a binding precedential 
decision, is persuasive authority 
pertaining to DHS’s authority to fill the 
statutory silence and implement a 
registration requirement.
66
The court in 
Liu correctly recognized that registration is not a petition, but rather an 
antecedent procedural step.
67
Creation 
of an antecedent registration 
requirement, and random selection of 
registrations or petitions, as applicable, 
are reasonable gap filling regulations 
just as the current rulemaking is a 
reasonable gap filling regulation 
consistent with the Secretary’s broad 
statutory authority. 
DHS also disagrees with the 
commenter’s assertion that it is 
premature to implement a new selection 
process before at least a couple of years 
have passed since the implementation 
of the beneficiary-centric selection 
process. DHS notes that this final rule 
builds on, and does not replace, the 
changes made by the final rule 
implementing the beneficiary-centric 
selection process.
68
DHS also notes that 
the gaming addressed by the final rule 
implementing the beneficiary-centric 
selection process was the submission of 
multiple registrations for the same 
beneficiary by companies that were 
working together to unfairly increase a 
beneficiary’s chance of selection. That is 
a different issue than what this final 
rule will address. This final rule builds 
on the 2024 final rule to continue 
selecting beneficiaries, such that the 
selection process remains beneficiary- 
centric rather than registration-centric, 
but weights each unique beneficiary in

rule builds on the 2024 final rule, DHS 
disagrees with the commenter’s 
assertion that DHS should have waited 
longer before making additional changes 
to the H–1B cap selection process. 
4. DHS Background and Justification for 
the Rule 
Comment: Some commenters expressed support for DHS’s 
justifications for the proposed rule and 
reasoned that the H–1B program does 
not bring in high-skilled workers and is 
instead used to replace U.S. workers at 
lower costs. A commenter similarly 
expressed support for DHS’s 
justifications, concluding that the 
current random lottery allows for 
program abuse and has become the 
primary mechanism through which the 
H–1B program fails to meet its core 
mission. Another commenter 
acknowledged that given the high 
volume of H–1B applications USCIS 
simultaneously receives exceeding the 
cap, it is impossible to determine the 
order in which they were filed. The 
commenter stated that because the 
original statute cannot be adhered to, 
DHS’s rationale in proposing an 
updated selection process is reasonable. 
Response: As noted in the H–1B Proclamation, the H–1B program has 
been deliberately exploited to replace, 
rather than supplement, U.S. workers 
with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor. 90 
FR 46027 (Sept. 24, 2025). The large- 
scale replacement of U.S. workers 
through systemic abuse of the program 
has undermined both our economic and 
national security. 90 FR 46027 (Sept. 24, 
2025). The current random selection 
process has contributed to the ongoing 
exploitation of the H–1B program to 
benefit certain companies in certain 
sectors, while crowding out other 
companies and legitimate job seekers. 
For this primary reason, DHS is 
implementing a weighted selection 
process that would generally favor the 
allocation of H–1B visas to higher- 
skilled and higher-paid aliens, while 
maintaining the opportunity for 
employers to secure H–1B workers at all 
wage levels, to better serve the 
congressional intent for the H–1B 
program. 
Comment: Some commenters opposed the rule, claiming that the proposed rule 
is based on the false premise that 
foreign workers displace or take away 
job opportunities from U.S. workers and 
depress wages. For instance, some 
commenters cited statistics highlighting 
the positive impacts H–1B workers 
make to the economy and showing that 
H–1B workers make wages above the 
median for U.S. workers. Likewise, a 
commenter said that the NPRM ignores 
studies that convincingly show that 
workers with H–1B visas earn more than 
similarly situated U.S. workers. The 
commenter added that the proposed 
rule fails to show why it is necessary to 
prioritize more-senior workers given 
that the average H–1B visa holder is 
already earning more than similar U.S. 
workers, particularly if doing so risks 
eroding many of the economic benefits 
of the H–1B program. Another 
commenter said that entry level roles 
are not displacing U.S. workers and that 
removing international graduates from 
the applicant pool simply excludes 
equally qualified candidates. 
Response: DHS disagrees with the commenters. As an initial matter, DHS 
does not dispute the general premise 
that H–1B workers can make positive 
contributions to the U.S. economy. DHS 
sees the value that highly skilled H–1B 
workers can bring to the economy, 
provided that the H–1B program 
functions as originally intended, which 
is to help employers bring temporary 
workers into the United States to 
perform additive, high-skilled functions 
to supplement the U.S. workforce and to 
help the U.S. economy. 
However, the H–1B program is not 
functioning as intended. Instead, it is 
being exploited on a large scale to bring 
in lower-paid, lower-skilled workers. As 
noted in the H–1B Proclamation the H– 
1B program has been deliberately 
exploited to replace, rather than 
supplement, U.S. workers with lower- 
paid, lower-skilled labor. 90 FR 46027 
(Sept. 24, 2025). The H–1B 
Proclamation also indicated that many 
U.S. tech companies have laid off their 
qualified and highly skilled U.S. 
workers and simultaneously hired 
thousands of H–1B workers, and some 
even forced their U.S. workers to train 
the foreign workers. 90 FR 46027 (Sept. 
24, 2025). Further, unemployment 
among recent computer science and 
computer engineering graduates has 
reached some of the highest levels in the 
country and has been exacerbated by 
abuse of the H–1B visa program. 90 FR 
46027 (Sept. 24, 2025). This rule is an 
important step to reversing the abuse of 
the H–1B program. This rule will 
disincentivize the existing widespread 
use of the H–1B program to fill lower 
paid or lower skilled positions. Instead, 
U.S. employers that might have 
petitioned for cap-subject H–1B workers 
to fill relatively lower-paid, lower- 
skilled positions, may be incentivized to 
hire available and qualified U.S. 
workers for those positions. 
Comment: Many commenters disputed the premise that wage is a 
proxy for experience, skill, or education. 
Several commenters stated that the 
proposed rule is based on the false 
premise that salary alone equates with 
value and individuals who earn more in 
their profession contribute more to the 
economy. Some commenters said that 
DHS failed to provide empirical support 
for its core assumptions—that higher 
wage levels reliably correlate with 
higher skills, productivity, or greater 
economic benefit to the United States, 
or that some industries paying higher 
wages are more valuable to the economy 
and society than other industries that 
offer more modest salaries. Commenters 
emphasized that wage levels do not 
accurately reflect skill, innovation, 
potential, economic contributions, 
contributions to underserved 
communities, or other contributions. 
One commenter noted that wage levels 
do not necessarily reflect skill or 
economic contribution and cited 
multiple studies that demonstrate that 
using wage level as a proxy for skill 
level lacks empirical evidence and may 
harm both employers and workers. 
Some commenters remarked that wages 
are impacted by a variety of factors not 
taken into account in the rule, including 
different industries, market, employer 
size, or geography, and it is an 
unreliable proxy for skill and 
professional level. 
A commenter said level I reflects 
standard entry-level positions and that 
removing the level would contradict 
‘‘the government’s own system and 
unfairly redefines ‘‘specialty 
occupation’’ as something only senior 
employees can fill.’’ Another 
commenter voiced concern that the 
proposed rule would significantly skew 
H–1B lottery outcomes and urged DHS 
to reconsider its impact on lower-wage 
applicants. 
Response: DHS disagrees with these comments and believes that salary 
generally is a reasonable proxy for skill 
level. As stated in the NPRM, in most 
cases where the proffered wage equals 
or exceeds the prevailing wage, a 
prevailing wage rate reflecting a higher 
wage level is a reasonable proxy for the 
higher level of skill required for the 
position, based on the way prevailing 
wage determinations are made. DHS 
believes that an employer who offers a 
higher wage than required by the 
prevailing wage level does so because 
that higher wage is a clear reflection of 
the beneficiary’s value to the employer, 
which, even if not related to the 
position’s skill level per se, reflects the 
unique qualities the beneficiary 
possesses. DHS believes that the rule

See DOL, ETA, ‘‘Wage Methodology for the Temporary Non-Agricultural Employment H–2B 
Program,’’ 76 FR 3452, 3453 (Jan. 19, 2011) (it is a 
‘‘largely self-evident proposition that workers in 
occupations that require sophisticated skills and 
training receive higher wages based on those 
skills.’’); Daniel Costa & Ron Hira, Economic Policy 
Institute, ‘‘H–1B Visas and Prevailing Wage Level’’ 
(May 4, 2020), https://www.epi.org/publication/h-

typically a function of inherent capability, 
education level, and experience. It would be

70
For example, in Computer and Mathematical 
Occupations, the FY 2024 national median salary of 
H–1B workers for Level I was $89,253; for Level II 
was $106,000; for Level III was $140,000; and for 
Level IV was $163,257. USCIS OPQ, SAS PME C3 
Consolidated, VIBE, DOL OFLC TLC Disclosure

illustrates that median wages generally increase

wage levels increase to account for a higher-than- 
usual skill or other job requirements, the data show 
the correlation between higher median wages and 
higher skill and wage levels. 
will incentivize an employer to proffer 
a higher wage to increase their chances 
of selection, but that the employer only 
would do so if it was in their economic 
interest to do so based on the 
beneficiary’s skill level and relative 
value to the employer. 
DHS acknowledges that aliens may be 
offered salaries at level I prevailing 
wages to work in specialty occupations 
and may be eligible for H–1B status. 
DHS is not removing the possibility of 
selection for registrations for positions 
paid at level I wages through this 
rulemaking. However, DHS also believes 
that, in years of demand exceeding the 
annual limits for initial H–1B visas or 
status grants subject to the numerical 
allocations, the current process of 
purely random selection does not 
optimally serve Congress’ purpose for 
the H–1B program. Instead, in years of 
excess demand, selection of H–1B cap- 
subject petitions generally on the basis 
of the OEWS prevailing wage level that 
the proffered wage equals or exceeds, 
which generally correlates to higher 
skills, is more consistent with the 
purpose of the H–1B program and with 
the administration’s goal of improving 
policies such that H–1B classification is 
more likely to be awarded to petitioners 
seeking to employ higher-skilled and 
higher-paid beneficiaries. The purpose 
of this rule is to implement a weighted 
selection process that will generally 
favor the allocation of H–1B visas to 
higher-skilled and higher-paid aliens, 
while maintaining the opportunity for 
employers to secure H–1B workers at all 
wage levels. 
Comment: Multiple commenters stated that wage levels are inadequate to 
compare workers across occupations 
and that wage levels are intended to 
ensure fair pay within occupation and 
area of intended employment. Some 
commenters stated that wage levels are 
based on experience, education, and 
supervisory level within a given 
occupation and geographic location, 
while other commenters stated that 
wage levels are more reflective of 
seniority and career progression rather 
than skill. A commenter similarly 
indicated that the prevailing wage levels 
were not intended to be used in this 
way, but rather meant to ensure that 
employing foreign workers does not 
adversely impact the wages and working 
conditions of U.S. workers, and are used 
by DOL to characterize career 
progression. 
Some commenters stated opposition 
to the rule, reasoning that it would favor 
lower-skilled and lower-paid positions, 
contrary to its stated goal of prioritizing 
higher-skilled, higher-paid workers. A 
commenter referenced how prevailing 
wage levels are calculated based on the 
average wage for similarly employed 
workers in a specific occupation and 
location, which could advantage 
occupations with lower entry-level 
requirements. Similarly, a commenter 
stated that the use of wage levels would 
prioritize lower-skilled, lower-paid 
workers, undermining the purpose of 
the rule, which is to prioritize top talent 
with scarce and in-demand skills. 
Additionally, the commenter stated that 
while wage levels correlate well with 
wages within a specific occupation, 
wages between occupations can vary 
significantly, which was not taken into 
account in the proposed rule, and 
provided several examples to illustrate 
this point. Some commenters stated the 
proposed selection process could favor 
seniority in lower-paid occupations over 
high-wage, high-skill roles in other 
fields, and is not supported by 
underlying statute, DOL regulations, 
guidance, or ‘‘the government’s own 
data.’’ 
While voicing concern about the use 
of prevailing wage levels in the 
proposed weighted selection process, a 
commenter stated that applying wage 
levels across industries was 
‘‘inappropriate,’’ as DOL’s prevailing 
wage system accounts for factors, such 
as job duties, education, experience, and 
location, which vary significantly by 
occupation. The commenter remarked 
that high-skilled roles—such as 
physicians, lawyers, and professors— 
may still fall under level I wages due to 
standard entry requirements, while 
other occupations with lower 
educational thresholds could qualify for 
higher wage levels. The commenter 
reasoned that this mismatch could lead 
to inequitable outcomes, where 
individuals in lower-paid occupations 
might receive more chances in the 
lottery than those in higher-skilled, 
higher-paid roles. 
Multiple commenters discussed 
concerns in associating lower wage 
levels with low skill work, noting that 
more advanced occupations with more 
rigorous job requirements may be 
assigned lower wage levels compared to 
less advanced occupations with lower 
job requirements. For example, some 
commenters said that a specialized 
surgeon earning $300,000 would be 
certified as a level I and a Ph.D. working 
at a high tech company earning 
$280,000 would be certified at a level II, 
whereas an acupuncturist earning 
$41,600 is considered level III and a 
landscape architect with a $36,000 
salary is certified as level IV. Another 
commenter noted that a Master’s degree 
requirement for a Job Zone 4 occupation 
can result in a level II wage while the 
same requirement for a Job Zone 5 
occupation can result in a level I wage, 
despite the Job Zone 5 position being 
more advanced. Another commenter 
similarly noted that employees in 
occupations with a higher Specific 
Vocational Preparation (SVP) and higher 
levels of compensation may be assigned 
lower prevailing wage levels than 
occupations with a lower SVP and said 
that a position requiring a doctorate and 
2–4 years of experience may have a 
prevailing wage level I that is set at 
$200,000 per year, whereas a position in 
an occupation that has an entry level 
requirement of a Bachelor’s degree and 
0–2 years of experience may yield a 
salary of $150,000 per year at prevailing 
wage level 3. Another commented noted 
the different wage levels resulting from 
differing job requirements of 
cardiologists as compared to civil 
engineers. 
Response: DHS disagrees that wage levels are inadequate to compare 
workers across occupations. DHS is 
aware that different occupational 
classifications carry differing position 
and wage requirements and that wage 
levels reflect a comparison within an 
occupation, rather than across 
occupations. DHS also recognizes that 
higher wage levels may correspond with 
seniority, but this does not negate the 
fact that they also reflect higher skills 
required for the position. 
As noted in the NPRM, DHS believes 
that salary generally is a reasonable 
proxy for skill level.

beyond those of an entry level worker). 
corresponding prevailing wage.
71
A 
proffered wage that corresponds to the 
prevailing wage rate reflecting a higher 
wage level is generally a reasonable 
proxy for the higher level of skill of the 
alien or value placed by the employer 
on the alien’s value to the employer. 
DHS recognizes, however, that some 
employers may choose to offer a higher 
proffered wage to a certain beneficiary 
to be more competitive in the H–1B 
selection process. 
Regarding the occupational examples 
provided by commenters, DHS notes 
that the purpose of this rule is not to 
prioritize certain occupations or 
industries over others. The purpose of 
this rule is to implement the numerical 
cap in a manner that generally favors 
the allocation of H–1B visas to higher- 
skilled and higher-paid aliens, while 
maintaining the opportunity for 
employers to secure H–1B workers at all 
wage levels and in all eligible 
occupations. 
Comment: Some commenters criticized the proposed rule as lacking 
clarity and justification, specifically 
stating that the rule does not clearly 
explain how ‘‘wages’’ will be defined or 
measured, whether future positions are 
considered, how wage amendments 
after approval will be handled, how 
wage levels will be set or updated, or 
how part-time versus full-time work 
will be treated. A commenter stated that 
the rule lacks necessary specificity, as it 
fails to define key terms (e.g., how ‘‘wage’’ is computed for remote work 
and for split worksites), and it offers no 
credible description of enforcement 
mechanisms to prevent wage 
manipulation, post-selection wage 
reductions, or worksite misreporting. 
The commenter concluded that this 
vagueness would invite both litigation 
and systemic abuse. 
Response: DHS disagrees with these commenters’ assertions that the rule 
lacks clarity and justification and 
disputes the claims made by these 
commenters. DOL regulations define 
payment of wages for purposes of 
satisfying the H–1B required wage. See 
20 CFR 655.731(c)(2). This rule does not 
change how wages are defined or 
measured, including how wages are 
computed for remote work and split 
worksites. It is unclear what the 
commenter is referring to when stating 
that the rule does not clearly explain 
‘‘whether future positions are 
considered,’’ but notes that at the time 
a registration is submitted, each 
prospective petitioner is required to sign 
an attestation, under penalty of perjury, 
that the registration reflects a legitimate 
job offer (among other attestations). 
Regarding the comment claiming a lack 
of clarity around how wage 
amendments after approval will be 
handled, DHS refers to new 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(10)(iii), finalized in this rule, 
which allows USCIS to deny a 
subsequent new or amended petition 
filed by the petitioner, or a related 
entity, on behalf of the same beneficiary 
if USCIS were to determine that the 
filing of the new or amended petition is 
part of the petitioner’s attempt to 
unfairly increase the odds of selection 
during the registration (or petition, if 
applicable) selection process, such as by 
reducing the proffered wage to an 
amount that would be equivalent to a 
lower wage level than that indicated on 
the original registration or petition. 
Furthermore, DHS does not set or 
update wage levels and did not propose 
to do so through this rule. Finally, the 
adjudication of part-time employment is 
not relevant in the selection process. 
5. Concerns the Rule Is Arbitrary and 
Capricious 
Comment: Some commenters raised concerns that the proposed weighted 
selection process’s core assumption— 
that higher salaries correlate with 
economic value, innovation potential, 
and long-term contributions to U.S. 
competitiveness—is arbitrary and 
capricious. A commenter stated that 
treating salary as a universal proxy for 
skill across occupations and regions is 
insufficiently substantiated. The 
commenter said the change effectively 
converts a beneficiary-centric lottery 
into a salary screen, raising ‘‘arbitrary 
and capricious’’ risk and disregarding 
reliance interests of diverse 
stakeholders. A commenter stated that 
every agency has a constitutional duty 
under the Administrative Procedure Act 
(APA) to act in good faith, to prevent 
arbitrary discrimination, and to uphold 
the rule of law, and this rule fails all 
three tests. Another commenter noted 
that OEWS updates trail the market, so 
similar offers can receive different 
weights based on timing alone. The 
commenter concluded that elevating 
salary to the ‘‘decisive lever,’’ without 
robust evidence that it consistently 
tracks skill across occupations and 
regions, raises serious APA concerns. 
One commenter said that the 
proposed rule is arbitrary and 
capricious because it overlooks the 
impact on H–1B petitions for essential 
roles in healthcare, education, and other 
sectors reliant on early-career 
professionals. Citing Motor Vehicle 
Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm, the commenter said DHS failed to consider 
a key aspect of the issue, resulting in a 
policy that harms U.S. businesses and 
contradicts the Administration’s goals. 
Other commenters stated that the 
proposed rule was arbitrary and 
capricious because it failed to address 
the impact on small and mid-sized 
employers. 
Response: Based on its comprehensive review of the submitted 
comments and available evidence, DHS 
has concluded that, by changing the 
selection process from a purely random 
lottery selection to a weighted selection 
process generally based on the OEWS 
prevailing wage level that the proffered 
wage equals or exceeds, DHS will 
implement the statute more faithfully to 
its dominant legislative purpose. DHS 
disagrees with the claim that this rule is 
arbitrary or capricious, or that it fails to 
account for potential negative impacts 
on certain types of H–1B positions and 
industries. First, DHS reiterates that the 
new weighted selection process will 
neither exclude nor ‘‘effectively 
exclude’’ H–1B visa petitions for level I 
wages. Second, DHS has determined, 
after considering possible negative 
impacts, that pure randomization does 
not serve the ends of the H–1B program 
or congressional intent to help U.S. 
employers fill labor shortages in 
positions requiring highly skilled 
workers. DHS believes that the potential 
costs of engaging in a wage-level-based 
weighting of registrations for unique 
beneficiaries are outweighed by the 
benefits of better ensuring that initial H– 
1B visas and status grants would more 
likely go to the highest skilled or highest 
paid beneficiaries, while not effectively 
precluding those at lower wage levels. 
Comment: A commenter said that the proposed rule ‘‘represents a substantial 
policy shift’’ from when the agency said 
in 2019 that prioritizing H–1B petitions 
beyond degree-based criteria ‘‘would 
require statutory change.’’ The 
commenter noted that under the APA, 
agencies are expected to provide a 
reasoned explanation when changing 
interpretations. The commenter claimed 
DHS did not do so, and that DHS’s 
change in interpretation is ‘‘[w]ithout a 
compelling factual record or new 
statutory mandate’’ and risks being 
found arbitrary and capricious. Another 
commenter said that the proposed rule 
disregards established reliance interests 
for certain industries and fails to 
provide a rational basis for its changes, 
rendering it legally unsupported and 
arbitrary.

today,] believed that facilitating the admission of 
higher-skilled immigrants would benefit the 
economy and increase the United States’ 
competitive edge in attracting the ‘best and the 
brightest’ in the global labor market.’’). 
Response: DHS recognizes that it considered the issue of cap selection by 
wage level in 2019 and concluded at 
that time that prioritization by wage 
level or other bases would require 
statutory change. DHS acknowledged 
that prior statement in footnote 20 in the 
preamble to the proposed rule. See 90 FR 45986, 45990 (Sept. 24, 2025). DHS 
reconsidered the analysis as far back as 
2020, and again in the context of this 
rulemaking, and determined that 
selection by wage level is consistent 
with its broad statutory authority and 
fills a statutory gap in a way that is 
consistent with a key goal of the 
program. 
DHS recognizes that some employers 
may have relied on a random selection 
process to prepare for the possibility 
that the beneficiary(ies) the employer 
registered for might be selected. DHS, 
however, disagrees with any assertion 
that a purely random selection process 
engenders strong reliance interests or 
that such reliance interests outweigh the 
benefit of a weighted selection process 
that better protects the wages, working 
conditions, and job opportunities of 
U.S. workers. 
DHS disagrees with the assertion that 
it did not provide a rational basis for the 
rule. As explained in the preamble to 
the proposed rule, while the current 
random selection of petitions or 
registrations is reasonable, DHS believes 
it is neither the optimal, nor the 
exclusive method of selecting 
registrations or petitions toward the 
numerical allocations when more 
registrations or petitions, as applicable, 
are simultaneously submitted than 
projected as needed to reach the 
numerical allocations. See 90 FR 45986, 45990 (Sept. 24, 2025). Pure 
randomization does not serve the ends 
of the H–1B program or congressional 
intent to help U.S. employers fill labor 
shortages in positions requiring highly 
skilled workers.
72
Under the current 
random selection process, in every fiscal 
year from FY 2019 through FY 2024, 
petitions for beneficiaries at wage level 
III and wage level IV were the least 
represented among all wage levels in 
cap-subject H–1B filings, both under the 
regular cap and the advanced-degree 
exemption.
73
 
As DHS explained in the preamble to 
the proposed rule, by engaging in a 
wage-level-based weighting of 
registrations for unique beneficiaries, 
DHS will better ensure that initial H–1B 
visas and status grants would more 
likely go to the highest skilled or highest 
paid beneficiaries, while not effectively 
precluding those at lower wage levels. 
See 90 FR 45986, 45991 (Sept. 24, 2025). Facilitating the admission of higher 
skilled workers ‘‘would benefit the 
economy and increase the United States’ 
competitive edge in attracting the ‘best 
and the brightest’ in the global labor 
market,’’ consistent with the goals of the 
H–1B program and will help to 
safeguard the nation’s overall economic 
security.

Comment: A commenter alleged that USCIS failed to explain why it is 
changing direction based on its previous 
findings that foreign nationals employed 
in STEM fields are important for 
businesses and the economic 
development of the United States. See 
81 FR 13040, 13047–48 (Mar. 11, 2016) 
(cap gap STEM OPT rule). The 
commenter concluded that USCIS failed 
to explain or justify the reasons for its 
‘‘reverse in course’’ in light of those 
prior findings and policy 
determinations. The commenter also 
claimed that DHS failed to consider the 
related reliance interests of employers 
in employing recent international 
student graduates. See Dep’t of 
Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Ca., 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020). 
Response: DHS disagrees with the commenter’s assertion that statements 
made nearly one decade ago in the 
context of a rulemaking pertaining to F– 
1 nonimmigrants indicate a change of 
course in the H–1B nonimmigrant 
context. DHS notes that this final rule, 
which pertains to the selection of 
beneficiaries in the H–1B cap selection 
process, does not preclude employers 
from registering H–1B beneficiaries with 
STEM degrees in the H–1B cap and, if 
selected, from filing a petition on their 
behalf. 
As DHS explained in the preamble to 
the proposed rule, by engaging in a 
wage-level-based weighting of 
registrations for unique beneficiaries, 
DHS will better ensure that initial H–1B 
visas and status grants would more 
likely go to the highest skilled or highest 
paid beneficiaries, while not effectively 
precluding those at lower wage levels. 
See 90 FR 45986, 45991 (Sept. 24, 2025). As explained previously in response to 
other comments, pure randomization 
does not serve the ends of the H–1B 
program or congressional intent to help 
U.S. employers fill labor shortages in 
positions requiring highly skilled 
workers, regardless of whether those 
positions are in STEM related fields. 
DHS recognizes that some employers 
may have relied on a purely random 
selection process to prepare for the 
possibility that the beneficiary(ies) the 
employer registered for might be 
selected. DHS, however, disagrees with 
any assertion that a purely random 
selection process engenders strong 
reliance interests or that such reliance 
interests outweigh the benefit of a 
weighted selection process that better 
protects the wages, working conditions, 
and job opportunities of U.S. workers, 
including those in STEM related 
positions. 
6. Other Legal Comments 
Comment: Some commenters wrote that terminating or changing the lottery 
system has broad political and 
economic consequences that implicates 
the major questions doctrine, so clear 
congressional authority is required to 
change the system. Another commenter 
said that the rule implicates the major 
questions doctrine, explaining that 
when an agency claims authority to 
make decisions of ‘‘vast economic and 
political significance,’’ courts require 
clear congressional authorization West 
Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 723–4 (2022). The commenter added that 
fundamentally restructuring how H–1B 
visas are allocated constitutes a major 
question and that the INA’s directive 
that visas be issued ‘‘in the order’’ 
petitions are filed does not clearly 
authorize DHS to create a wage-based 
preference system. 
Response: The major questions doctrine, as articulated in West Virginia 
v. EPA, applies in ‘‘extraordinary cases’’ where an agency claims a 
‘‘transformative expansion’’ of its 
regulatory authority without clear 
congressional authorization. However, 
the selection process detailed in this 
rule does not trigger the major questions 
doctrine. 
This rule deals with the Secretary’s 
administration and enforcement of the 
H–1B numerical allocations—a topic 
that DHS has long regulated, including

See Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 395 (2024) (explaining that a statute’s meaning 
may be that the agency is authorized to exercise a 
degree of discretion and empowered to prescribe 
rules to fill in statutory gaps based on ‘‘reasoned 
decision making’’); see also Liu v. Mayorkas, 588 F. Supp. 3d 43, 55 (D.D.C. 2022) (finding that the 
registration requirement does not violate the INA, 
is not ultra vires, and that registration is merely ‘‘an 
antecedent procedural step to be eligible to file an 
H–1B cap[-subject] petition’’); Walker Macy LLC v. 
USCIS, 243 F. Supp. 3d 1156 (D. Or. 2017). via the random selection process that 
this rule will replace. Specifically, and 
as discussed elsewhere in this rule, the 
Secretary has broad authority to 
administer and enforce the INA, 
establish such regulations as the 
Secretary deems necessary for carrying 
out such authority, and to prescribe the 
time and conditions under which an 
alien may be admitted to the United 
States as a nonimmigrant and how an 
importing employer may petition for 
nonimmigrant workers. See INA secs. 103(a), 214(a)(1), and (c)(1), 8 U.S.C. 
1103(a), 1184(a)(1), and (c)(1). Such 
authority includes prescribing rules to 
fill statutory gaps, which DHS has done 
for years.
75
 
In West Virginia v. EPA, the Court found that the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) lacked clear 
congressional authorization to 
implement a generation-shifting 
approach to regulating power plant 
emissions under the Clean Air Act. By 
contrast, DHS’s authority under the INA 
and the HSA is broad and clear and falls 
under DHS’s traditional role. Unlike the 
EPA’s Clean Power Plan, which sought 
to restructure the nation’s energy grid— 
a task far outside the EPA’s traditional 
role—DHS’s wage-based selection 
process is well within its traditional role 
of administering and regulating the H– 
1B visa program. DHS has long 
exercised authority over the selection 
process for H–1B petitions, and this rule 
simply refines the selection 
methodology to prioritize higher paid 
and higher skilled workers. This is not 
a novel or transformative assertion of 
authority but rather a refinement of an 
existing regulatory function. 
In addition, in West Virginia v. EPA, the Court emphasized that the major 
questions doctrine applies when an 
agency’s action is inconsistent with 
Congress’s broader design. Here, the 
wage-based weighted selection process 
aligns with Congress’s intent in the INA 
to protect the wages, working 
conditions, and job opportunities of 
U.S. workers by ensuring that H–1B 
workers are not used to undercut 
domestic wages. See INA sec. 212(n), 8 U.S.C. 1182(n). The INA explicitly ties 
H–1B eligibility to wage requirements 
contained in the LCA process, which 
requires employers to pay the greater of 
the actual or the prevailing wage to H– 
1B workers. The INA also mandates the 
computation of prevailing wage levels. 
See INA sec. 212(p), 8 U.S.C. 1182(p). This rule builds on this statutory 
framework by prioritizing higher-wage 
workers in the selection process, 
thereby furthering Congress’s goal of 
protecting the wages, working 
conditions, and job opportunities of 
U.S. workers. 
The Court in West Virginia was 
concerned with the EPA’s assertion of 
authority to ‘‘substantially restructure 
the American energy market’’ under a 
‘‘long-extant statute.’’ The wage-based 
H–1B weighted selection process does 
not involve a comparable expansion of 
DHS’s authority. DHS is not asserting 
new or unheralded powers; it is merely 
adjusting the methodology for selecting 
H–1B registrations (or petitions) in a 
way that is consistent with its statutory 
mandate and historical practice. The 
rule does not create a new regulatory 
regime or fundamentally alter the 
structure of the H–1B program. 
The majority in West Virginia 
identified several factors that might 
trigger the major questions doctrine, 
including whether the agency action 
involves a matter of ‘‘vast economic and 
political significance’’ or represents an 
‘‘unheralded power.’’ None of those 
factors apply here. The wage-based 
weighted selection process does not 
have vast economic or political 
significance; it affects only the method 
by which DHS selects H–1B 
registrations (or petitions) under the 
statutory cap. While the rule may be 
significant to those U.S. workers who 
have had to compete with lower-paid 
H–1B workers who have dominated the 
current random selection process, and 
will help to attract the ‘‘best and 
brightest’’ to the United States by 
increasing the chance of selection for 
higher-skilled, higher-paid aliens, the 
rule’s overall economic impact is not 
vast. And this rule does not assert a new 
power; DHS has long exercised 
authority over the H–1B selection 
process and has previously modified 
that process through rulemakings. 
While the wage-based H–1B selection 
process is economically significant 
under Executive Order (E.O.) 12866, it 
does not rise to the level of ‘‘vast 
economic and political significance’’ 
required to trigger the major questions 
doctrine. The threshold for economic 
significance under E.O. 12866 is 
relatively low ($100 million annual 
impact), whereas the major questions 
doctrine requires a much higher level of 
economic and political impact. In West 
Virginia v. EPA, the Court applied the doctrine to the EPA’s Clean Power Plan 
because it sought to restructure the 
entire energy grid—a matter of 
extraordinary economic and political 
significance. By contrast, DHS’s wage- 
based H–1B weighted selection process 
does not involve a comparable 
restructuring of the economy or labor 
market. The rule affects only the 
selection methodology for H–1B 
registrations (or petitions), a discrete 
regulatory function within DHS’s 
traditional authority. The wage-based 
weighted selection process is narrowly 
tailored to incentivize employers 
seeking initial classification of H–1B 
cap-subject aliens to offer higher wages, 
or to petition for positions requiring 
higher skills and higher-skilled aliens, 
that are commensurate with higher wage 
levels. It affects the odds of selection for 
a program that has long been over- 
subscribed and under which selection 
was previously random and never 
guaranteed. It does not fundamentally 
alter the structure of the H–1B program 
or the broader labor market. While the 
rule may shift the composition of H–1B 
workers toward higher-wage positions, 
it does not impose new substantive 
requirements on employers or workers 
beyond the existing statutory 
framework. 
Comment: A commenter wrote that DHS has not demonstrated that it has 
considered and ruled out alternative 
methods to accomplish its goals, which 
is required by the APA. The commenter 
wrote that ‘‘[t]he only other means DHS 
appears to have considered is the 
‘ranking’ model the agency pursued in 
2020, which would have had even more 
drastic impacts on early-career talent, 
and was vacated in court and later 
withdrawn.’’ 
Some commenters expressed concern 
that the proposed rule could make the 
program more susceptible to legal 
challenges. One commenter stated that 
legal challenges regarding statutory 
authority for the weighted selection 
approach would be likely, and litigation 
would leave employers with lingering 
uncertainty about whether the process 
might ‘‘change midstream.’’ The 
commenter wrote that ‘‘[e]mployers 
begin planning months in advance of 
the H–1B registration window, and it is 
critical for businesses to be able to fulfill 
talent needs in their operations with 
confidence that the rules will not 
change midstream. Expected litigation 
could cause companies to lose global 
talent to other countries, especially in 
the midst of competition for dominance 
in AI and other critical technologies.’’

instead chose to propose a weighted 
selection process. See 90 FR 45986, 46013 (Sept. 24, 2025). DHS also 
requested potential alternatives to the 
proposed weighted selection process. 90 
FR at 46013. The commenter, however, 
did not identify alternatives for DHS to 
consider and instead asserted that the 
statute is unambiguous and that DHS is 
not permitted to establish a 
prioritization scheme through 
rulemaking. (See subsequent Section III 
F.1 Alternatives to the Proposed Weighted Selection Process for DHS’ 
consideration of alternatives suggested 
by other commenters.) 
DHS disagrees with the commenter’s 
assertion that DHS should not finalize 
the rule because it may lead to litigation 
challenging the rule and uncertainty as 
to the cap selection process while 
litigation is pending. DHS does not 
believe that the threat of future 
litigation, and speculation as to the 
ultimate outcome of any future litigation 
pertaining to the final rule, is a 
reasonable basis not to finalize a rule 
that will improve the administration of 
the H–1B cap selection process and 
better protect the wages, working 
conditions, and job opportunities of 
U.S. workers. 
D. Proposed Changes to the Registration 
Process for H–1B Cap-Subject Petitions 
1. Proposed Weighted Selection Process 
Comment: Some commenters expressed their support for the proposed 
weighted selection process. For 
instance, a commenter stated their 
support for maintaining opportunities 
across all wage levels. The commenter 
remarked that while the proposed rule 
prioritizes higher wage levels, it still 
would allow employers offering 
positions at wage levels I and II to 
participate in the H–1B program. The 
commenter concluded that this 
approach would help ensure the 
program remains accessible to a wide 
range of employers and industries that 
require specialized knowledge but may 
not offer top-tier wages. Another 
commenter stated support for the 
weighted selection process and 
particularly commented on the use of 
OEWS wage levels for a SOC code 
within a particular area of intended 
employment as an effective mechanism 
for wage and geographic normalization. 
The commenter explained that this 
‘‘astutely avoids an unfair advantage’’ 
for employers in certain areas. 
Response: DHS agrees that the weighted selection approach will help 
ensure the program remains accessible 
to a wide range of employers and 
industries. The purpose of this rule is to 
implement a weighted selection process 
that will generally favor the allocation 
of H–1B visas to higher skilled and 
higher-paid aliens, while maintaining 
the opportunity for employers to secure 
H–1B workers at all wage levels. DHS 
also agrees that the use of OEWS wage 
levels is effective for wage and 
geographic normalization. 
Comment: Some commenters asserted that the proposed weighting (four times 
chance for level IV, three times chance 
for level III, two times chance for level 
II, and one times chance for level I) is 
arbitrary. One commenter said the 
weighting appears to simply reflect the 
numbers assigned to the four wage 
levels, not workers’ relative salaries, 
skill levels, or economic value. Another 
such commenter added that the usage of 
4x, 3x, 2x, and 1x weighting lacks 
evidence demonstrating that the 
multiples would meet the H–1B 
program’s goals, address integrity gaps 
left unresolved by previous reform, and 
protect U.S. workers. 
Response: DHS disagrees that the proposed weights are arbitrary. The 
multiples of 4 times, 3 times, and 2 
times, correspond to wage levels IV, III, 
and II, respectively, as selected on the 
registration form (or petition if 
registration is suspended). It is 
reasonable to tie the probability of an 
alien’s chances of selection in the 
lottery to the highest OEWS wage level 
that the proffered salary equals or 
exceeds because salary is generally a 
reasonable proxy for skill level.
76
DHS 
data show a correlation between higher 
salaries and higher skill and wage 
levels.
77
As a position’s required skill 
level increases relative to the 
occupation, so too, may the wage level, 
and necessarily, the corresponding 
prevailing wage. A proffered wage that 
corresponds to the prevailing wage rate 
reflecting a higher wage level is 
generally a reasonable proxy for the 
higher level of skill required for the 
position. The proposed weighting 
scheme was chosen because it would 
achieve the policy goals of increasing 
the average skill level of the H–1B 
worker, thus better protecting U.S. 
workers, while balancing that goal with 
the competing policy goal of ensuring 
that U.S. employers who are unable to 
pay a proffered wage that corresponds to 
a higher wage level are not precluded 
from the opportunity to obtain H–1B 
workers if otherwise eligible. DHS 
believes that this rule appropriately 
balances the interests of U.S. workers 
with the interests of petitioning 
employers and the alien workers they 
seek to employ as H–1B nonimmigrants. 
2. Required Information From 
Petitioners 
a. OEWS Wage Level 
Comment: A commenter asked about the timing of the wage level ‘‘lock-in.’’ 
Specifically, the commenter said that 
the rule requires that ‘‘the OEWS wage 
level selected on the petition must 
reflect the corresponding OEWS wage 
level as of the date that the registration 
underlying the petition was submitted.’’ 
See 90 FR 45986, 45993 (Sept. 24, 2025). The commenter asked DHS to clarify 
which data controls if OEWS wage data 
is updated between registration and 
petition filing, which can be 90 or more 
days apart. The commenter also asked 
how registrants should account for this 
uncertainty when making initial wage 
level selections. 
A few commenters expressed 
concerns about potential consequences 
if OEWS prevailing wage data were to 
change in between the time of 
registration submission and petition 
filing. A commenter stated that OEWS 
updates can lag, which could result in 
identical job offers that straddle release 
cycles to receive different weights for 
reasons unrelated to skill, producing 
arbitrary outcomes. Another commenter 
discussed annual wage appreciation that 
is effective for their position each May, 
which could affect the wage level 
selected, but would not be anticipated 
or reflected in their March petition. The 
commenter expressed concerns about 
being penalized if they submit lower or 
higher wage estimate of their future 
wage. The commenter suggested more 
flexible prevailing wage levels, rather 
than a fixed wage level. A commenter 
expressed that requiring employers to 
commit to specific wage levels during 
registration, then verifying that petition 
wages match registration wages months

79
As stated in the NPRM, in this context, a 
‘‘legitimate job offer’’ and a ‘‘bona fide job offer’’ 
mean the same thing. DHS is finalizing the phrase 
‘‘bona fide job offer’’ to more closely align with the 
definition of a ‘‘United States employer’’ at 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(4)(ii), which requires that the employer 
have ‘‘a bona fide job offer for the beneficiary to 
work within the United States.’’ 
80
See DOL, Labor Condition Application for H– 1B, H–1B1 and E–3 Nonimmigrant Workers, Form 
ETA–9035CP—General Instructions for the 9035 & 
9035E, https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/ oflc/pdfs/Form%20ETA-9035CP%20Instructions_exp.%2010.31.2027.pdf (expires Oct. 31, 2027). later, would create multiple 
opportunities for technical violations 
that have nothing to do with fraud or 
abuse but reflect the reality of how 
hiring processes work in practice. 
Response: The OEWS wage level selected on the petition must reflect the 
corresponding OEWS wage level as of 
the date that the underlying registration 
was submitted, unless registration is 
suspended. In other words, in years that 
registration is required, the OEWS wage 
data used to determine the wage level 
on the registration is ‘‘locked in’’ as of 
the date of the registration. As clearly 
stated in the NPRM 90 FR 45986, 45993 
(Sept. 24, 2025) and finalized at new 8 
CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(1), petitioners 
must submit evidence of the basis of the 
wage level selected on the registration 
as of the date that the registration 
underlying the petition was submitted 
(emphasis added). 
Specifically, as finalized, the 
revisions to Form I–129 direct 
petitioners to follow the form 
instructions to select the appropriate 
wage level box in response to question 
2, Section 3.
78
The revisions to the Form 
I–129 instructions list the following as 
required initial evidence if filing for an 
H–1B cap petition in a year that 
registration is required: ‘‘Evidence of the 
basis of the wage level selected on the 
registration. Such evidence could 
include, but is not limited to, a printout 
from the DOL [Office of Foreign Labor 
Certification] (OFLC) Wage Search 
website for the beneficiary’s SOC code 
and area(s) of intended employment as 
of the date of registration’’ (emphasis 
added). The revisions to the Form I–129 
instructions further state: ‘‘The OEWS 
wage level selected must reflect the 
corresponding OEWS wage level as of 
the date that the registration underlying 
the petition was submitted’’ (emphasis 
added). However, if the registration 
process is suspended, the OEWS wage 
level selected must reflect the 
corresponding OEWS wage level as of 
the date that the petition is submitted.’’ 
Thus, DHS believes it is sufficiently 
clear that the appropriate wage level 
selected in response to Section 3, 
question 2 pertains to OEWS wage data 
that was current as of the date of 
registration. Even if OEWS wage data 
changes in between the registration and 
the petition filing, the Form I–129 
petition (i.e., the appropriate wage level box selected on question 2, Section 3) 
should still reflect information that was 
current as of the time of registration. For 
example, if the proffered wage at the 
time of registration corresponded to a 
level IV wage, but a subsequent change 
in OEWS wage data resulted in the same 
proffered wage corresponding to a level 
III wage at the time of filing the petition, 
the petitioner would select the level IV 
wage box in response to Section 3, 
question 2, on the Form I–129 petition. 
However, the petitioner may wish to 
submit an explanation of any relevant 
changes in OEWS wage data with the 
petition. 
Regarding the commenters’ concerns 
about committing to the OEWS wage 
level at the time of registration and the 
suggestion for more flexible prevailing 
wage levels, DHS must collect the wage 
information at the time of registration, 
prior to petition filing in April, in order 
to weight and select registrations. DHS 
does not see another viable solution for 
collecting wage information at a later 
date or allowing flexible wage levels. 
Additionally, under the current 
registration process, registrants must 
attest that the registration reflects a 
legitimate job offer. Through this rule 
making, DHS is modifying this language 
to require registrants certify that the 
registration reflects a bona fide job offer 
and codifying that ‘‘a valid registration 
must represent a bona fide job offer’’ at 
new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(ii).
79
A bona 
fide job offer is one that exists as 
described on the registration and 
petition and in which the employer 
intends to employ the beneficiary. As 
such, DHS believes that registrants (or 
petitioners) should be able to accurately 
reflect the corresponding wage level at 
the time of registration. 
Comment: A commenter stated that it is unclear whether DHS will rely on the 
wage level reflected on the LCA or the 
OEWS level that the offered wage equals 
or exceeds. The commenter requested 
DHS confirm this point. 
Response: DHS disagrees that the rule is unclear on which wage level will be 
the basis for weighting in the selection 
process. The rule clearly states that, on 
the registration (or petition, in the event 
of suspended registration), the registrant 
(or petitioner, if applicable) must select 
the highest OEWS wage level that the 
beneficiary’s proffered wage equals or 
exceeds for the relevant SOC code in the 
area(s) of intended employment. 
The wage level selected on the LCA 
may differ from the appropriate wage 
level selected on the registration as a 
result of this rule allowing registrants to 
choose the highest OEWS wage level 
that the beneficiary’s proffered wage 
generally equals or exceeds for the 
relevant SOC code in the area(s) of 
intended employment. It is important to 
distinguish the appropriate wage level 
selected for purposes of the registration 
with the wage level selected for 
purposes of the LCA. The wage level 
and prevailing wage requirements are 
part of the LCA process regulated by 
DOL. A petitioner is required to file an 
LCA with DOL attesting that H–1B 
nonimmigrants will be paid either the 
actual wage paid by the employer to all 
other individuals with similar 
experience and qualifications for the 
specific employment in question or the 
prevailing wage for the occupational 
classification in the area of intended 
employment, whichever is greater. See 
INA secs. 212(n)(1)(A)(i) through (ii), 8 
U.S.C. 1182(n)(1)(A)(i) through (ii); 20 
CFR part 655, subpart H. Petitioners 
must follow DOL instructions to specify 
the appropriate wage level for the 
requirements of the offered position for 
purposes of the LCA.
80
 
Comment: A commenter stated that allowing employers to interpret key 
factors that determine the prevailing 
wage (e.g., employers interpreting the occupation and wage level differently 
and granting employers substantial 
front-end discretion over choices when 
they have conflicts of interest) 
introduces errors. The commenter 
claimed that this can be remedied with 
stronger back-end enforcement. The 
commenter provided examples of H–1B 
data from two large H–1B employers 
that they state demonstrate the failure of 
prevailing wage regulations in achieving 
their goal of protecting workers, labor 
standards, and labor market integrity. 
Response: DHS recognizes that allowing employers to select the factors 
(i.e., the SOC code, wage level, and location) that determine prevailing wage 
may introduce some errors. However, 
DHS does not see another viable 
solution for allowing petitioners to self- 
select such factors at the registration 
stage. DHS notes that, as part of the DOL 
process, petitioners already select the 
factors determining the prevailing wage 
and include such information on the 
LCA. DOL must certify the application 
within 7 days unless the application is 
incomplete or contains obvious 
inaccuracies. See INA sec. 212(n)(1), 8 VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:36 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\29DER2.SGM 29DER2

U.S.C. 1182(n)(1). If the LCA is certified, 
the petitioner may file a petition with 
USCIS based on the certified LCA. See 
INA sec. 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), 8 U.S.C. 
1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b). Further, both DOL 
and DHS already have several integrity 
measures in place to ensure that 
employers follow the prevailing wage 
regulations and make truthful 
attestations on the LCA, registration, 
and petition. See 20 CFR 655.705(b); 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(i)(B)(1)(ii); 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(10)(ii) and (11)(iii)(A)(2). 
DHS agrees with the need for stronger 
back-end enforcement. This rule 
finalizes new integrity measures to 
guard against petitioners intentionally 
misclassifying the occupation, for 
example, by requiring the H–1B petition 
filed after registration selection to 
contain and be supported by the same 
position information and contain a 
proffered wage that equals or exceeds 
the prevailing wage for the 
corresponding OEWS wage level in the 
registration for the SOC code in the 
area(s) of intended employment. See 
new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(1). The 
rule also finalizes a provision allowing 
USCIS to deny a subsequent new or 
amended petition in certain 
circumstances suggesting an attempt to 
unfairly increase the odds of selection. 
See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iii). These new provisions will complement 
existing integrity provisions and 
enhance DHS’s back-end enforcement. 
i. Prevailing Wage Not Based on OEWS 
or No Current OEWS Prevailing Wage 
Information Available 
Comment: A few commenters stated that the rule would have a negative 
impact on petitioners using alternative 
wage sources, such as private wage 
surveys, collective bargaining 
agreements (CBAs), Service Contract Act 
(SCA) wage determinations, or other 
legitimate sources. For instance, a 
commenter stated that where employers 
rely on CBAs or legitimate private 
surveys, if the proffered wage falls 
below OEWS level I, the registration is 
forced into level I—reducing selection 
weight even for highly specialized jobs. 
The commenter said this punishes 
lawful, collectively bargained structures 
and sectors with atypical wage curves. 
A different commenter similarly 
expressed concerns that the rule does 
not treat wages arising out of alternative 
sources on equal footing. Another 
commenter wrote that the proposed rule 
conflicts with the DOL’s regulations 
defining prevailing wages based on 
collective bargaining agreements and 
SCA wage determinations because it 
would render those wage 
determinations ‘‘disadvantageous when 
they are correlated with a level I or level 
II OEWS wage rate under the 
corresponding SOC-listed occupation. 
As a result, USCIS’ proposed rule 
undercuts those prevailing wage rates 
and deems them detrimental for 
employers seeking to employ H–1B 
workers whose wages are subject to 
collective bargaining or SCA wage 
rates.’’ 
Response: When determining how to rank and select registrations (or 
petitions, as applicable) by wage level, 
DHS decided to use OEWS prevailing 
wage levels because they are the most 
comprehensive and objective source for 
comparing wages. The OEWS program 
produces employment and wage 
estimates annually for approximately 
830 occupations.
81
Additionally, most 
registrants and petitioners are familiar 
with the OEWS wage levels since they 
are used by DOL and have been used in 
the foreign labor certification process 
since 1997.
82
 
OEWS prevailing wage level data is 
publicly available through DOL’s 
Foreign Labor Application Gateway 
(FLAG) system. Wages based on 
alternate sources, such as private wage 
surveys, collective bargaining 
agreements, and SCA wage 
determinations, are not always publicly 
available and do not always have four 
wage levels. 
DHS disagrees with the assertions that 
petitioners that use non-OEWS wage 
sources would be disadvantaged by the 
rule. Petitioners may continue to use 
private wage surveys and other 
alternative wage sources, if they choose 
to do so, to establish that they will be 
paying the beneficiary a required wage. 
This rule, however, will weight 
registrations (or petitions, as applicable) 
generally based on the highest OEWS 
wage level that the proffered wage 
equals or exceeds as OEWS wage data 
is the most comprehensive and objective 
source for comparing wages.
83
 
Petitioners that use a private wage 
survey may choose to increase the 
proffered wages of their prospective 
beneficiaries in order to increase their 
chances of selection. 
To help avoid disadvantaging 
prospective petitioners that rely on a 
private wage survey or other alternative 
sources to determine the required wage 
level for the proffered position for 
registration purposes, new 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(4)(i) states that 
registrants relying on a prevailing wage 
that is not based on the OEWS survey 
would select the ‘‘wage level I’’ box on 
the registration form if the proffered 
wage were less than the corresponding 
level I OEWS wage. DHS expects that all 
petitioners offering a wage lower than 
the OEWS wage level I wage will be 
using another legitimate source other 
than the OEWS survey. However, DHS 
deliberately chose to group these 
registrations together with level I 
registrations so that petitioners relying 
on non-OEWS sources would have a 
better chance of selection than if there 
were an additional category below level 
I and these registrations would have 
been weighted below level I 
registrations. 
Comment: A commenter stated that although 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(4)(i) 
requires registrants to follow DOL 
guidance on prevailing wage 
determinations (PWDs) when no OEWS 
prevailing wage information is 
available, the rule does not specify 
which version of the guidance applies. 
Response: As indicated in the NPRM, in the limited instance where there is no 
current OEWS prevailing wage 
information for the proffered position, 
the registrant would follow DOL 
guidance on PWDs to determine which 
OEWS wage level to select on the 
registration. 90 FR 45986, 45993 (Sept. 
24, 2025). The sentence included a 
footnote to the proper guidance in effect 
as of the time of publication of the 
NPRM: DOL, Employment and Training 
Administration (ETA), Prevailing Wage 
Determination Policy Guidance: 
Nonagricultural Immigration Programs 
(last modified Nov. 2009), https://
www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/ 
oflc/pdfs/NPWHC_Guidance_Revised_11_2009.pdf. As of the time of publication of this final rule, this is still 
the guidance in effect that registrants 
should use, however, in the event DOL 
updates their guidance in the future, 
registrants should use any updated 
version of the Prevailing Wage 
Determination guidance published by 
DOL.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260904 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations ii. Supporting Evidence of Basis of Wage 
Level 
Comment: A commenter requested clarification on the requirement to 
‘‘submit evidence of the basis of the 
wage level selected on the registration 
as of the date that the registration 
underlying the petition was submitted.’’ 
The commenter asked what specific 
evidence would be accepted, asking for 
example if a printout from the DOL 
OFLC Wage Search website would 
suffice in all cases, and asking how 
petitioners should document 
determinations made using alternative 
methodologies when OEWS data is 
unavailable. 
Response: Petitioners must submit evidence of the basis of the wage level 
selected on the registration as of the 
date that the registration underlying the 
petition was submitted. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(1). As noted in the 
NPRM, such evidence could include, 
but is not limited to, a printout from the 
DOL OFLC Wage Search website for the 
beneficiary’s SOC code and area(s) of 
intended employment as of the relevant 
date. 90 FR 45986, 45993 (Sept. 24, 
2025). Where an alternate wage source 
is used, a petitioner should submit 
evidence that is appropriate for that 
source, such as a private wage source or 
collective bargaining agreement. 
iii. Lowest Equivalent OEWS Wage 
Level When Beneficiary Would Work in 
Multiple Locations or Positions 
Comment: A commenter expressed support for the proposals to use the 
lowest applicable wage or location for 
multi-site roles, and to treat multiple 
registrations for the same beneficiary by 
the lowest wage level, saying these 
proposals will address abuse patterns. 
Conversely, a commenter stated that the 
proposal directing employers to choose 
the lowest level of multiple locations 
that the proffered wage meets or exceeds 
undermines the policy objective of 
rewarding higher wages and skills. 
Response: DHS agrees with the commenter that said using the lowest 
applicable wage level if the beneficiary 
will work in multiple locations makes 
the most sense to preserve program 
integrity. DHS disagrees with the 
commenter that said that this 
requirement undermines the policy 
objective of the rule. As noted in the 
NPRM, this requirement removes a 
potential incentive to inflate wage levels 
through strategic location or position 
choices and helps ensure integrity of the 
selection process. 90 FR 45986, 45993 
(Sept. 24, 2025). While a major policy 
objective of the rule is to favor the 
allocation of H–1B visas to higher- 
skilled and higher-paid aliens, it is also 
important that DHS not jeopardize 
program integrity. 
Comment: Regarding agents placing beneficiaries in multiple positions, a 
commenter asked how they should 
calculate and document the ‘‘lowest 
corresponding OEWS wage level’’ when 
positions may have different SOC codes, 
different locations, and different wage 
structures. 
Response: As indicated in the NPRM, if the beneficiary will work in multiple 
locations, or in multiple positions if the 
petitioner is an agent, the petitioner 
must select the lowest corresponding 
OEWS wage level that the beneficiary’s 
proffered wage will equal or exceed. 90 
FR 45986, 45992–93 (Sept. 24, 2025). 
Petitioners must submit evidence of the 
basis of the wage level selected on the 
registration as of the date that the 
registration underlying the petition was 
submitted. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(1). As noted in the 
NPRM, such evidence could include, 
but is not limited to, a printout from the 
DOL OFLC Wage Search website for the 
beneficiary’s SOC code and area(s) of 
intended employment as of the relevant 
date. 90 FR 45986, 45993 (Sept. 24, 
2025). Such evidence may also include 
a separate print-out for each location, 
and each position if there are multiple 
positions. USCIS will consider all 
submitted evidence, in addition to the 
information contained in the 
registration, LCA, and petition, to 
determine if the registrant indeed 
selected the lowest corresponding 
OEWS wage level among the multiple 
locations or positions. 
iv. Lowest OEWS Wage Level Among 
All of the Registrations Submitted on a 
Beneficiary’s Behalf (if the Registrations 
Have Different Wage Levels) 
Comment: Expressing concern about ‘‘loopholes’’ in the rule, a commenter 
recommended, in cases where multiple 
employers petition on behalf of the 
same individual, only the petitions at 
the highest wage level should be 
considered, and to require beneficiaries 
to remain at the same position title and 
receive at least the same wages as 
shown in their application for the 
duration of their visa. 
Conversely, a commenter stated that 
the proposal for USCIS to assign a wage 
level to a beneficiary based on the 
lowest OEWS wage level among all 
registrations for a beneficiary will erase 
legitimate higher wage offers and give 
controlling significance to the lowest 
bid. Another commenter said that this 
approach would penalize a legitimate 
employer with a level IV wage, and 
requested that DHS consider the highest 
OEWS wage level among the 
registrations to avoid the ‘‘cascading 
effect that would otherwise allow one 
lower-wage registration to dilute the 
merit-based weighting for all employers 
associated with the same worker.’’ 
Another commenter discussed the 
situation where multiple entries are 
created for registrants who file H–1B 
petitions at wage level II and the 
resulting dilution of any advantage of 
higher wage level registrants. Further, 
the commenter discussed handling of 
beneficiaries with multiple offers and 
where the lower-level offer will 
determine the lottery positioning of all 
of that beneficiary’s petitions. Another 
commenter said that the rule creates 
inequity for multi-location employers, 
pointing to proposed 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(4)(i), which says that 
if a position involves multiple 
worksites, the employer must base the 
registration on the lowest applicable 
wage level across all sites. The 
commenter explained that a software 
engineer dividing time between Atlanta 
(level III) and Birmingham (level II) 
must therefore be registered at level II. 
The commenter said that this ‘‘lowest- 
common-denominator’’ rule penalizes 
universities, hospitals, regional service 
firms, and manufacturers that maintain 
distributed or hybrid operations, forcing 
them into lower-weighted categories 
and further reducing selection odds. 
Response: DHS is aware that multiple employers may register or petition on 
behalf of the same individual at various 
corresponding wage levels. However, 
rather than assign the highest wage level 
among multiple registrations as the 
commenters suggest, DHS believes that 
assigning the lowest wage level is 
preferable because it would create less 
of an incentive for unscrupulous 
employers to try to game the system. In 
this scenario, a beneficiary for whom a 
level I registration and a level IV 
registration have been submitted will be 
assigned to wage level I for the purpose 
of weighted selection. The proposal to 
assign the beneficiary to the lowest 
OEWS wage level among all of the 
registrations submitted on his or her 
behalf is intended to remove an 
incentive for multiple registrants to 
submit frivolous registrations with 
artificially high wage levels in an 
attempt to unfairly increase a 
beneficiary’s chances of selection. 
DHS is aware of the potential that a 
registration with a wage corresponding 
to a lower wage level would negatively 
impact other registrations for the same 
beneficiary at higher wage levels,

DOL, ETA, Prevailing Wage Determination 
Policy Guidance: Nonagricultural Immigration 
Programs (last modified Nov. 2009), https://
www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/oflc/pdfs/ 
NPWHC_Guidance_Revised_11_2009.pdf. registrants will communicate with 
beneficiaries to make informed 
decisions regarding whether other 
companies have submitted registrations 
on their behalf, and under which 
corresponding wage level. 
Regarding multi-location employers, 
DHS does not agree that this rule will 
generally penalize the list of employer 
types that the commenter indicated. 
Employers should be aware that, if they 
are placing beneficiaries at multiple 
locations, DHS will assign the 
registration the lowest corresponding 
wage level for selection purposes. DHS 
does not believe that this is a common 
enough scenario that it is worth leaving 
open a loophole for unscrupulous 
employers to try to game the system. 
v. Other Comments Related to OEWS 
Wage Data 
Comment: Some commenters expressed other concerns about 
perceived inadequacies of OEWS data 
and survey methodology. One 
commenter raised concerns about 
relying solely on OEWS data to 
determine wage levels, noting it could 
lack detail for emerging, specialized, or 
hybrid roles. Another commenter raised 
concerns about OEWS survey 
methodology, saying that urban 
respondents outnumber rural 
respondents, artificially inflating wages 
for many positions. The commenter also 
said that the voluntary nature of DOL’s 
wage survey makes it highly unlikely 
that there will be an accurate depiction 
of physician wage levels across all 
specialties and all geographic areas. A 
different commenter wrote that the 
prevailing wage system concentrates 
opportunities in lower-wage localities or 
remote arrangements, disadvantaging 
large cities that serve as innovation 
hubs. This commenter wrote that a 
prevailing wage framework should 
better align level I wages ‘‘to the true 
entry level percentile for the occupation 
and locality’’ and should allow 
alternative wage sources when OEWS 
data for a locality are skewed by senior 
level concentrations. 
Response: DHS recognizes that the OEWS system has certain data 
limitations but disagrees that an 
alternative method of calculating wages 
is necessary to implement a fair and 
efficient weighted H–1B cap selection 
process. DHS notes that DOL guidance 
on prevailing wage determinations 
provides for use of the OEWS survey.
84
 
Additionally, DHS believes that OEWS 
provides the most comprehensive and 
objective publicly available source for 
obtaining prevailing wage information 
and, thus, is still the best available 
option to serve the overarching goal of 
this rule. Further, DHS believes that 
incorporating non-OEWS wage sources 
into the registration selection process 
would add unnecessary complexity into 
the process and frustrate the goal of 
administering the cap selection process 
in an efficient and effective manner. 
vi. SOC Code of Proffered Position 
Comment: A commenter said the proposed rule assumes that SOC codes 
can serve as a precise proxy for labor 
market value and skill differentiation, 
but in practice SOC codes are broad 
occupational groupings developed for 
statistical tracking, not for making 
nuanced distinctions in immigration 
benefit allocation. For example, the 
commenter wrote that the SOC 
classification ‘‘Attorney’’ encompasses 
all practice areas regardless of 
specialization, meaning a newly 
licensed attorney in a small firm and a 
highly experienced attorney in a 
specialized practice are treated 
identically, which would create 
distortions when wage-based weighting 
is applied without regard to function or 
expertise. 
Another commenter wrote that there 
are significant ambiguities in choosing 
SOC codes, as many positions fall 
between two or three SOC codes, and 
beneficiaries often have 
interdisciplinary educational 
backgrounds, which could create 
inconsistencies in how wage levels and 
lottery weights are applied. Similarly, a 
commenter stated that because multiple 
roles can map to multiple plausible SOC 
codes with different wage ladders, the 
SOC choice will directly affect selection 
odds, which increases the stakes and the 
chance of misclassification disputes. A 
couple of commenters discussed 
inconsistencies between how employers 
classify occupations using SOC codes. A 
commenter stated that the proposed 
wage level construct is misleading 
because it does not allow for effective 
comparison or ordering for, or among, 
specific or detailed occupations. 
Response: While DHS understands that SOC codes sometimes provide 
broad occupational groupings that may 
not allow for nuances in certain 
occupations, DHS does not see a viable 
alternative for sorting and classifying 
occupations for the purpose of this rule. 
Employers already must select the 
appropriate SOC code when submitting 
an LCA and when filing an H–1B 
petition, and this rule relies on that 
longstanding practice to implement a 
process to efficiently and effectively 
determine the corresponding wage level 
for purpose of weighting registrations or 
petitions, as applicable. DHS disagrees 
with the commenter’s assertion that a 
newly experienced attorney would be 
treated the same as a specialized and 
experienced attorney. DHS believes that 
employers will offer a wage 
commensurate with the difference in 
experience and specialization, such that 
it is more likely that an experienced, 
specialized attorney would be paid a 
wage that corresponds to a higher wage 
level than a newly experienced attorney 
and have a greater chance of selection 
based on this final rule. 
b. Area of Intended Employment 
Comment: Multiple commenters stated that wage levels based on 
geographic location could lead to 
inconsistent outcomes, where the same 
salary places applicants in different 
wage levels depending on the region. A 
commenter stated that there is a risk of 
introducing inequitable geographic and 
sectoral consequences because 
prevailing wage data are inconsistent 
across metropolitan areas and 
occupational codes, causing firms in 
lower-cost regions to potentially face 
artificially lower selection odds than 
when offering competitive wages 
relative to local market. 
Some commenters claimed that the 
proposed rule would disproportionately 
disadvantage applicants in high-cost 
areas, even when their compensation 
and skill level are equivalent to those in 
lower-cost regions. Some commenters 
said that cost-of-living differences 
across regions create structural bias 
where employers in high-cost 
metropolitan areas struggle to meet 
wage thresholds while those in lower- 
cost regions can more easily offer higher 
wage levels for similar roles. Similarly, 
a commenter stated that a salary-based 
weighting system would benefit 
outsourcing firms in lower-cost areas 
while hurting start-ups and other tech 
companies in high-cost hubs like 
Silicon Valley. One commenter stated 
that the proposed wage weighting 
would punish ‘‘agglomeration centers’’ 
and reward lower-cost regions, 
‘‘skewing outcomes away from where 
spillovers and mentorship are largest.’’ 
Another commenter suggested that the 
proposed weighting could penalize 
applicants in ‘‘innovation-driven 
regions,’’ such as San Francisco and 
Seattle where employees earn higher 
wages due to living costs and 
competitive markets. 
In contrast, a few commenters stated 
that the proposed rule would favor 
companies in high-cost areas, where

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260906 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations higher salaries are more common, over 
those in lower-cost areas. A commenter 
expressed concern that a pure wage- 
based model would unfairly penalize 
employers in States with lower costs of 
living, even if they are paying fair, 
market-competitive salaries locally. A 
commenter expressed concern that the 
proposed rule could create geographic 
bias by favoring workers in high-cost 
metropolitan areas over those in rural or 
lower-cost regions, potentially 
undermining national economic 
development goals. A commenter said 
this geographic distortion could lead to 
inequities and make the program appear 
arbitrary. 
Response: DHS disagrees that this rule will disproportionately disadvantage or 
advantage registrants in certain 
geographic areas. The rule neutralizes 
geographic differences in salary 
amounts by taking into account the area 
of intended employment when 
weighting registrations. Particularly, 
USCIS will select H–1B registrations 
generally based on the highest OEWS 
prevailing wage level that the proffered 
wage equals or exceeds for the relevant 
SOC code and area(s) of intended 
employment. In weighting according to 
the equivalent wage level, which 
already considers the area(s) of intended 
employment, the final rule makes it so 
that registrations for the same wage 
level will be weighted the same 
regardless of whether their proffered 
wages are different owing to their areas 
of intended employment. 
Comment: A commenter expressed concern that the prevailing wage system 
would set entry-level thresholds too 
high in certain regions, creating barriers 
for junior international workers and 
misaligning wages with real cost-of- 
living. Another commenter said that 
while they support the wage level 
concept, they are concerned it could 
disadvantage workers at mid-sized 
companies who perform similar work as 
those at larger firms but receive lower 
pay due to location-based constraints, 
potentially leading to unfair outcomes 
in visa eligibility. Another commenter 
said that current wage tiers are too low 
to reflect market conditions, especially 
in certain regions. Another commenter 
stated that the NPRM does not provide 
supporting analysis of economic or 
regional impacts across metropolitan 
and nonmetropolitan areas. The 
commenter predicted the proposed 
wage-level weighting system would 
affect different occupations and 
geographic regions in different ways due 
to inequities that arise from local wage 
variations. The commenter stated the 
inequities in wage variations would 
impact lower nominal wage industries 
like healthcare, nonprofit research, and 
early-stage innovation, and would 
reduce the industry diversity and 
geographic reach of the H–1B program. 
Response: DHS disagrees that this rule will favor companies in certain areas 
since the rule neutralizes geographic 
differences in salary amounts by taking 
into account the area of intended 
employment when weighting 
registrations. The OEWS prevailing 
wage inherently accounts for wage 
variations by location, as such data is 
broken down by occupational 
classification in an area of employment. 
DHS agrees that some wage levels are 
below market rate, which is part of the 
reason DHS sees the need for this 
rulemaking. One of the goals of this rule 
is to better ensure that the H–1B cap 
selection process favors relatively 
higher-skilled, higher-valued, or higher- 
paid foreign workers rather than 
continuing to allow numerically limited 
cap numbers to be allocated 
predominantly to workers in lower 
skilled or lower paid positions. While 
DHS did not conduct an in-depth 
analysis to measure regional impacts 
across metropolitan and 
nonmetropolitan areas, DHS notes that 
the rule neutralizes geographic 
differences in salary amounts by taking 
into account the area of intended 
employment when weighting 
registrations. 
c. Other Comments Related to Required 
Information 
Comment: Some commenters discussed how certain staffing or 
contracting companies are deliberately 
altering or misrepresenting a 
beneficiary’s passport number so as to 
enter an individual multiple times in 
the registration. To avoid this problem, 
a commenter said that DHS must ensure 
that each registration must be 
accompanied by a scanned copy of the 
beneficiary’s passport with clearly 
identifiable information. 
Response: DHS does not believe requiring a scanned copy of the 
beneficiary’s passport with the 
registration is necessary, as the current 
regulations already require the 
petitioner to provide the beneficiary’s 
passport or travel document information 
at the time of registration. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(4)(i). Further, on the 
registration form the registrant must 
certify under penalty of perjury that the 
registration represents a bona fide job 
offer and that the organization(s) on 
whose behalf this registration is being 
submitted intends to file an H–1B 
petition on behalf of the beneficiary 
named in each registration if the 
beneficiary is selected. 
Petitioners are also required to submit 
evidence of the passport or travel 
document used at the time of 
registration to identify the beneficiary at 
the time of filing. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(1). The H–1B petition 
filed on behalf of a beneficiary must 
contain and be supported by the same 
identifying information, and if the 
passport numbers do not match, USCIS 
may deny or revoke the petition. USCIS 
may also deny or revoke a petition if the 
statement of facts contained on the 
registration or petition submission was 
inaccurate, fraudulent, materially 
misrepresents any fact, or was not true 
and correct. Additionally, USCIS may 
refer an individual or entity to 
appropriate Federal law enforcement 
agencies for investigation and further 
action, as appropriate. 
E. Process Integrity 
1. Certifying the Contents of the 
Registration and Consequences 
Comment: A commenter asked what documents must be provided at 
registration to demonstrate that the 
registration represents a bona fide job 
offer. 
Response: On the registration form, the registrant must certify under penalty 
of perjury, among other things, that the 
registration represents a bona fide job 
offer and that the organization(s) on 
whose behalf this registration is being 
submitted intends to file an H–1B 
petition on behalf of the beneficiary 
named in each registration, if the 
beneficiary is selected. Aside from the 
requisite certification, documentation is 
not required to be provided at the time 
of registration because USCIS does not 
adjudicate the registration. Registration 
is merely an antecedent procedural step 
to efficiently administer the H–1B cap 
selection process and determine 
eligibility to file an H–1B cap petition 
in years of excess demand. 
If USCIS has reason to believe that the 
certifications made during registration 
are not true and correct, it will 
investigate the parties in question, 
including examining evidence of 
collusion and patterns of non-filing of 
petitions. If USCIS finds that a 
certification was not true and correct, 
USCIS will find the registration to not 
be properly submitted. The prospective 
petitioner would not be eligible to file 
a petition based on that registration, and 
USCIS may deny a petition, or revoke a 
petition approval, based on an invalid 
registration that contained a false 
certification. New 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(10)(ii). USCIS may make 
findings of fraud or willful material 
misrepresentation against petitioners, if

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260907 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations the facts of the case support such 
findings. USCIS may also refer the 
individual or entity who submitted a 
false certification to appropriate Federal 
law enforcement agencies for 
investigation and further action, as 
appropriate. 
2. Potential Employer Wage 
Manipulation 
Comment: Numerous commenters said the proposed rule would 
incentivize employer wage 
manipulation at the registration stage. 
Multiple commenters reasoned that 
employers might inflate wages to 
increase their chances in the lottery 
without actually paying the stated 
wages. Many commenters also remarked 
that job titles or descriptions for a 
beneficiary could be inflated to increase 
the salary level and chance of selection. 
Some commenters discussed how 
companies could engage in fraudulent 
payroll practices by inflating paychecks 
to increase chances in the lottery. 
Commenters stated that companies may 
issue inflated paychecks to meet wage 
requirements on paper, but in reality 
pay employees much less. A commenter 
characterized the rule as a ‘‘half- 
measure,’’ writing that employers will 
inflate proffered wages on paper, then 
bench workers or dodge pay via 
loopholes like phantom bonuses— 
fueling abuse by outsourcers who 
undercut U.S. wage rates. One 
commenter discussed that small 
companies could inflate paychecks to 
meet wage requirements, sometimes 
reclaiming the excess amount from 
employees through unofficial means, 
even when there is no actual job. 
Another commenter suggested that 
companies could collude in determining 
which level of wage to offer to increase 
the chance of selection. 
A commenter said the rule may 
inadvertently encourage wage 
manipulation, such as by employers: 
artificially increasing wages to reach 
higher tiers without genuine job 
changes; cutting benefits or other 
compensation to offset inflated base 
pay; clustering wages just above OEWS 
thresholds (‘‘bunching’’); or narrowing 
job roles to maintain appearance of high 
pay. Other commenters suggested that a 
self-sponsored H–1B could claim they 
make a salary that would allow them to 
gain an advantage in the lottery. 
A commenter also raised concerns 
about employers manipulating salary 
timing to meet H–1B requirements, such 
as paying low wages for most of the year 
and increasing pay shortly before 
submitting a petition, thereby USCIS 
only seeing the higher recent pay on 
submitted paystubs. The commenter 
recommended requiring all paystubs or 
income tax records to verify consistent 
compensation. The commenter further 
cautioned that advances in AI could 
make it easier to falsify documents, 
urging USCIS to take greater care in 
validating submitted materials. 
Some commenters also expressed 
doubts about USCIS’ ability to enforce 
the proposed wage-based selection 
process and verify that employers pay 
the wages promised. A commenter said 
that the proposed rule does not address 
how companies will be prevented from 
inflating wages for the lottery and 
reducing them later. Another 
commenter recommended that 
employers report any changes to wage 
or position in real-time to USCIS, and 
that penalties for violations be 
significant enough to deter gaming the 
system, including fines and potential 
disqualification from future H–1B 
filings. Some commenters provided 
suggestions to detect and deter 
employer wage manipulation, including 
ensuring: 
€Employers provide supporting documentation that demonstrates the 
offered wage is appropriate for the 
position and location, such as internal 
compensation policies or comparable 
industry data. 
€Companies demonstrate real ability to pay the stated wage; 
€The occupational classification aligns with actual job duties; 
€The selected wage be paid for a minimum of 12 months after the H–1B 
start date; 
€Payroll records verify consistent compensation; 
€The employer provides a signed attestation confirming the wage 
commitment; 
€Penalties for violations or misclassification, including repayment 
of the difference and potential bans on 
future H–1B filings; 
€Tie the wage level used for weighting to the certified LCA at filing; 
€Require attestations under penalty of perjury; 
€Run post-selection audits against DOL OEWS and LCA data; and 
€Set meaningful penalties for misclassification. 
Response: DHS is also concerned about wage manipulation and program 
integrity, but this rule and existing 
regulations contain provisions to 
sufficiently address these concerns. This 
rule will require an H–1B petition filed 
after registration selection to contain 
and be supported by the same 
identifying information and position 
information, including SOC code, 
provided in the selected registration and 
indicated on the LCA used to support 
the petition. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(1). The petition must 
also include a proffered wage that 
equals or exceeds the prevailing wage 
for the corresponding OEWS wage level 
in the registration for the SOC code in 
the area(s) of intended employment as 
described in 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(4)(i). See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(1). In addition, USCIS 
may deny a subsequent petition by the 
employer if USCIS determines that the 
filing of the new or amended petition is 
part of the petitioner’s attempt to 
unfairly increase the chance of selection 
during the registration or petition 
selection process, as applicable, such as 
by changing the proffered wage in a 
subsequent new or amended petition to 
an amount that would be equivalent to 
a lower wage level than that indicated 
on the registration. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iii). 
These new requirements will work in 
conjunction with existing H–1B 
regulations to prevent unscrupulous 
actors from entering information at the 
registration stage to increase their 
chance of selection without intending to 
employ the beneficiary under the same 
terms indicated at registration. Both the 
submitted registrations and filed 
petitions are signed under penalty of 
perjury that the information on the 
registration or petition is true and 
correct and that both the registration 
and petition represent the offer of a 
legitimate or bona fide job. USCIS may 
deny a petition or, if approved, revoke 
the approval of a petition, if the 
statement of facts contained on the 
registration form is inaccurate, 
fraudulent, misrepresents any material 
fact, or is not true and correct. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(ii) and (11)(iii)(A)(2). 
Employers must also attest on the 
registration submission, under penalty 
of perjury, that they have not colluded 
to increase their chances of selection. 
DHS likewise agrees that petitioners 
misrepresenting the salary (including 
salary timing) in order to inflate the 
odds of selection, while not actually 
paying the beneficiary that salary, is an 
important integrity concern. DHS 
acknowledges these concerns but does 
not agree that the weighted selection 
framework will produce the harm 
described. Existing DHS and DOL 
regulations clearly require the petitioner 
to meet the obligations of the LCA and 
the petition, including the proffered 
wage requirements. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(B), 20 CFR 655.705(c)(1), 
and 655.731. This rule does not address 
or change DOL regulations regarding the 
petitioner’s wage obligations. Employers 
cannot inflate wages on paper to obtain 
higher wage levels because prevailing

wage classifications are based on job 
requirements and location, and 
employers are legally required to pay 
the actual or prevailing wage, whichever 
is higher. See INA sec. 212(n)(1), 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(1). Failure to pay at least 
the required wage is illegal and the rule 
does not change these obligations or 
create incentives for wage 
misclassification. Similarly, existing H– 
1B rules already prohibit unpaid 
benching and require employers to pay 
the required wage during nonproductive 
time. These protections remain fully in 
place under the weighted-selection 
process. 
Additionally, DHS
85
and DOL
86
have 
mechanisms in place to report concerns 
of fraud or misrepresentation in the H– 
1B process. If DOL finds that an 
employer has violated the LCA 
attestations and wage obligations, DOL 
may impose administrative sanctions 
and notify USCIS that the employer 
shall be disqualified from approval of 
petitions filed by the employer for a 
designated period of time, depending on 
the nature of the violations. See 20 CFR 655.800. Moreover, as noted previously, 
if USCIS discovers that a petitioner is 
violating the terms and conditions of the 
petition, including not paying the 
beneficiary the required wage, USCIS 
may revoke the petition approval on 
notice. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(11)(iii). During the adjudication of any petition 
based on a selected registration, USCIS 
will confirm that the OEWS wage level 
and LCA information support the 
submitted registration and petition. 
DHS notes that these regulations 
apply to all registrations, including 
those submitted by beneficiary owners. 
If a beneficiary owner submits a 
registration with a wage level that is 
higher than that which corresponds to 
what the offered position actually pays, 
the petition would be denied. If the 
beneficiary owner instead misrepresents 
the salary on the LCA or petition, the 
petition will be denied or the approval 
revoked because the information 
contained in the LCA or petition was 
not true and correct. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(ii) and (11)(iii)(A)(2). 
DHS declines to add additional 
evidentiary requirements to verify salary 
at the registration stage through this 
rulemaking, such as requiring all 
paystubs or income tax records, as 
USCIS does not adjudicate registrations. 
Further, requiring such documents as 
initial evidence during the petition stage 
may not be feasible, as many 
registrations are for prospective jobs 
such that this evidence would not be 
available at the time of filing. Moreover, 
USCIS already requires such evidence to 
determine whether the beneficiary 
maintained status when adjudicating an 
extension petition. USCIS also uses a 
compliance review program as an 
additional way to verify information in 
certain visa petitions.
87
Under this 
program, USCIS Fraud Detection and 
National Security (FDNS) officers make 
unannounced site visits to collect 
information as part of a compliance 
review. A compliance review verifies 
whether petitioners and beneficiaries 
are following the immigration laws and 
regulations that are applicable in a 
particular case. During a compliance 
review, FDNS officers may assess 
whether the beneficiary is being paid 
the wage as stated on the petition and 
consistent with the wage level marked 
on the registration. Therefore, DHS 
believes this rule and existing 
regulations are sufficient to address 
these issues. 
Concerning the comments on existing 
integrity issues, such as bad actors 
claiming to employ or pay beneficiaries 
when in reality the job does not actually 
exist and the beneficiary is then paying 
their ‘‘wage’’ back to the company, DHS 
continues to explore ways to improve 
the integrity of the H–1B petition 
process. However, as this concern is not 
a result of the proposed weighted 
selection process, it is beyond the scope 
of this narrowly tailored rule. Similarly, 
the suggestions that DHS pursue 
additional enforcement mechanisms, 
such as ‘‘penalties’’ for violations or 
misclassification, or potential bans from 
the registration, are also out of scope of 
this rulemaking. USCIS may, however, 
refer an individual or entity who 
submitted a false certification to 
appropriate Federal law enforcement 
agencies for investigation and further 
action, as appropriate. 
a. Part-Time Employment Concerns 
Comment: Several commenters expressed concerns about the possibility 
of abuse by companies that would offer 
part-time positions at greater hourly 
wages, but would reduce overall 
working hours, to increase their chance 
of selection. Other commenters 
expressed similar concerns about 
potential abuse of part-time positions or 
ways to manipulate work hours to 
artificially inflate the salary used as the 
basis for the registration. Commenters 
proposed that USCIS should only count 
the annual salary for lottery purposes, or 
require full-time employment. 
Response: DHS appreciates these concerns but believes they are 
adequately addressed by existing 
regulations and the provisions finalized 
by this rule. USCIS may already deny a 
petition or, if approved, revoke the 
approval of a petition, if the statement 
of facts contained on the registration 
form is inaccurate, fraudulent, 
misrepresents any material fact, or is not 
true and correct. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(ii) and (11)(iii)(A)(2). This 
final rule authorizes USCIS to deny or 
revoke approval of a subsequent new or 
amended petition filed by the petitioner, 
or a related entity, on behalf of the same 
beneficiary, if USCIS determines that 
the filing of the new or amended 
petition is part of the petitioner’s 
attempt to unfairly decrease the 
proffered wage to an amount that would 
be equivalent to a lower wage level, 
after listing a higher wage level on the 
registration to increase the odds of 
selection. See new CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iii) and (11)(iii)(A)(8). Thus, if USCIS finds 
that an employer misrepresented the 
part-time or full-time nature of a 
position, the number of hours the 
beneficiary would work, or the proffered 
salary, then USCIS could deny the 
petition or revoke the petition approval. 
See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(ii) and (11)(iii)(A)(2). The ability to deny or 
revoke approval of an H–1B petition in 
this context will militate against 
registrants and petitioners attempting to 
abuse the H–1B cap selection process 
through misrepresentation. 
b. Domestic vs. Consular Petitions 
Comment: Some commenters mentioned that employers who file 
petitions for consular processing can 
offer higher wages yet avoid paying 
those wages until the worker enters the 
United States, allowing them to gain 
selection process advantages without 
financial commitment. The commenters 
noted that this creates asymmetry 
between petitioners who must pay 
wages immediately for workers inside of 
the United States and those who delay 
activating their workers located abroad. 
Response: DHS declines to make any changes to address this perceived 
advantage or asymmetry. By the 
commenters’ logic, a petitioner 
requesting a one-year validity period 
would have an unfair advantage over a 
petitioner requesting a three-year 
validity period because they would not

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260909 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations have to pay the employee the stated 
wage for as long. However, the timing of 
wage obligations is governed by DOL 
regulations and is not being addressed 
or changed with this rule. DHS further 
notes that the petitioner must still be 
offering a bona fide job to the alien with 
the intent that the alien will enter the 
United States to perform the offered 
work. Employers are obligated to pay 
aliens in H–1B status in compliance 
with DOL regulations. Additionally, as 
noted previously, if the company or 
related entity were to file an amended 
petition in an attempt to later lower the 
proffered wage after using a higher wage 
level to gain an unfair advantage in 
registration, USCIS could deny that 
petition. See new CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iii). 3. Consistency Between the Registration 
and the Petition 
Comment: A commenter discussed the need for consistency of requirements 
between the registration and the petition 
stating that (1) a ‘‘zero-tolerance policy 
for bait-and-switch tactics’’ should be 
adopted and any discrepancy between a 
petition and registration result in an 
automatic denial; and (2) a cross-agency 
data verification (e.g., H–1B registration, DOL LCA filing, and Form I–129 
petition) should be used to flag 
inconsistencies in wage and position 
data for immediate manual review. 
Response: As noted in the NPRM, this rule will require an H–1B petition filed 
after registration selection to contain 
and be supported by the same 
identifying information and position 
information, including SOC code, 
provided in the selected registration and 
indicated on the LCA used to support 
the petition. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(1). 90 FR 45986, 
45995 (Sept. 24, 2025). This is necessary 
to prevent unscrupulous actors from 
entering information at the registration 
stage to increase their chance of 
selection without intending to employ 
the beneficiary under the same terms 
indicated at registration. USCIS will 
utilize available USCIS and DOL 
systems to ensure that the information 
on the LCA supports, and is consistent 
with, the registration and petition. 
4. Potential SOC Code Manipulation 
Comment: Some commenters reasoned the proposed rule would 
create opportunities for the SOC codes 
to be exploited to boost selection odds 
and manipulated to exaggerate job 
complexity. Another commenter said 
that the standards for assigning wage 
levels are not strict enough. Expanding 
on this same point, another commenter 
said that explicitly prioritizing wage 
levels will encourage employers to 
manipulate them, which they can 
achieve without actually raising 
salaries. The commenter explained that 
the largest new incentive will be to 
reclassify a job into an occupational 
category with a lower prevailing wage 
so that they will get more lottery entries 
for the same salary. 
One commenter provided an example 
of how two managerial roles could be 
classified under the Industrial Engineer 
SOC code (primary duties include 
technical process improvement, metrics 
analysis, and workflow optimization) to 
achieve a higher wage level, even 
though the position is effectively a 
managerial role. Some commenters also 
remarked that job titles or descriptions 
for a beneficiary could be manipulated 
to support selection of an SOC code 
where the proffered wage would place 
the beneficiary into a higher wage level 
rather than the true SOC code, which 
would put the beneficiary in a lower 
wage level, thereby inflating the 
beneficiary’s selection chances. 
Commenters also stated that lower- 
skilled job codes could be selected that 
have higher prevailing wages because 
the SOC framework permits multiple 
plausible classifications for a given role 
and not all specialized occupations have 
a perfectly matching SOC code. 
Response: All petitioners are required to identify the appropriate SOC code for 
the proffered position on the LCA. 
During the adjudication process, USCIS 
‘‘will determine whether the labor 
condition application involves a 
specialty occupation as defined in 
section 214(i)(1) of the Act and properly 
corresponds with the petition.’’ See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(i)(B). If USCIS has 
reason to question whether the SOC 
code selected by the petitioner properly 
corresponds with the petition, USCIS 
will comply with 8 CFR 103.2(b)(8) and 
may provide the petitioner an 
opportunity to explain the selected SOC 
code, as applicable. If USCIS determines 
that the petitioner failed to meet its 
burden of proof in establishing that it 
selected the appropriate SOC code for 
the position, USCIS may deny the 
petition. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(ii). Further, a petition will be denied if 
USCIS determines ‘‘that the statements 
on the petition, H–1B registration (if 
applicable), the application for a 
temporary labor certification, or the 
labor condition application, were 
inaccurate, fraudulent, or 
misrepresented a material fact, 
including if the attestations on the 
registration are determined to be false.’’ 
See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(ii). As such, a petitioner’s misrepresentation of the 
offered position on the LCA, 
registration, or petition is already 
grounds for denial of the petition. 
Additionally, if USCIS discovers that 
the petitioner is violating the terms and 
conditions of the petition (for example, 
employing the beneficiary in a position 
that does not align with the SOC code 
and position described in the petition, 
registration, or on the LCA), USCIS may 
revoke the petition approval on notice. 
See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(11)(iii). DHS believes that USCIS’ ability to verify 
that the LCA, including the SOC code 
on the LCA, properly corresponds with 
the petition will help to prevent 
possible abuse, such as choosing an 
inaccurate SOC code to increase the 
chance of selection. 
5. Potential Job Location Manipulation 
Comment: Several commenters expressed concerns that employers 
could manipulate job locations to meet 
specific salary thresholds, thereby 
improving an applicant’s chances of 
selection. Some commenters discussed 
how companies could choose a low-cost 
location with a level IV wage as the 
work location when entering the 
location, but after a brief period of stay, 
move the individual to the actual work 
location. Conversely, multiple 
commenters said employers could also 
promise a high-cost city wage level far 
above what they intend to pay and shift 
workers to lower-cost regions after 
activation where pay is significantly 
lower. A commenter noted that the 
proposed rule would effectively 
encourage companies to reposition jobs 
toward cheaper regions to gain lottery 
advantage, because the same job may be 
treated as ‘‘high level’’ in a smaller city 
and ‘‘low level’’ in a metropolitan hub. 
Commenters expressed concern that 
outsourcing firms could exploit the rule 
by relocating operations to smaller cities 
with lower wages. Citing examples of 
multiple office locations with the same 
wage package in different regions, a 
commenter asked how employee- 
preferred relocation to a position in a 
low-cost area (where the position would 
have a higher wage level) for a better 
chance in the lottery would be treated 
in terms of compliance. Some 
commenters questioned how USCIS will 
distinguish between permissible 
disclosure of multiple locations versus 
impermissible gaming of the wage level 
selection. 
Response: As noted in the NPRM, this rule will require an H–1B cap-subject 
petition filed after registration selection 
to contain and be supported by the same 
identifying information and position 
information, including SOC code, 
provided in the selected registration and 
indicated on the LCA used to support 
the petition. See new 8 CFR VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:36 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\29DER2.SGM 29DER2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260910 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(1). 90 FR 45986, 
45995 (Sept. 24, 2025). Such petition 
must also include a proffered wage that 
equals or exceeds the prevailing wage 
for the corresponding OEWS wage level 
in the registration for the SOC code in 
the area(s) of intended employment as 
described in 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(4)(i). See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(1). These 
requirements are necessary to prevent 
unscrupulous actors from entering 
information at the registration stage to 
increase their chance of selection 
without intending to employ the 
beneficiary under the same terms 
indicated at registration. DHS also 
expects that the area of intended 
employment provided at registration 
will be reflected as a worksite in the 
subsequently filed petition, such that 
the petition continues to support the 
requirement that the registration was 
based on a bona fide job offer. See new CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(1). While the 
registration will require the registrant to 
list only one work location— 
specifically, the work location 
corresponding to the lowest equivalent 
wage level as the area of intended 
employment if the beneficiary will work 
in multiple locations—the petition will 
have to list all addresses where the 
beneficiary is expected to work. 
The final rule will also allow USCIS 
to deny a subsequent new or amended 
petition filed by the petitioner, or a 
related entity, on behalf of the same 
beneficiary if USCIS were to determine 
that the filing of the new or amended 
petition was part of the petitioner’s 
attempt to unfairly increase the odds of 
selection during the registration (or 
petition, if applicable) selection process, 
such as by reducing the proffered wage 
to an amount that would be equivalent 
to a lower wage level than that indicated 
on the original registration or petition. 
See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iii). If the new or amended petition included the 
same proffered wage but changed the 
work location such that the proffered 
wage now corresponded to a lower 
OEWS wage level for the new location 
than the level indicated on the 
registration, USCIS will consider that 
change in determining whether the new 
or amended petition was part of the 
petitioner’s attempt to unfairly increase 
the odds of selection. These regulations 
will apply regardless of the reason for 
relocation and whether it was employer 
or employee driven. 
This rule does not prevent employers 
from making business decisions about 
the location or relocation of their 
operations and the terms of employment 
for their employees. If an employer 
chooses to move a position to a low-cost 
area while retaining a salary 
commensurate with a high-cost location, 
such that the salary would result in a 
higher wage level designation in the 
low-cost area, that is in the purview of 
the business. This would be permissible 
under this rule as long as the employer 
is offering a bona fide position at that 
location and the beneficiary will in fact 
work in that location. However, 
attempts to then move the beneficiary 
back to a high-cost location would be 
heavily scrutinized and the petition 
could be denied if USCIS finds that the 
employer did not meet its burden of 
proof to show that the move was not 
made to unfairly increase the chances of 
selection. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iii). 
In regard to questions about how 
USCIS will distinguish between 
legitimate multiple locations and 
impermissible gaming, the proposed 
rule makes clear that the position, as 
described on the LCA and registration, 
must be bona fide and if the offered 
position involved work in multiple 
locations, the employer must submit a 
registration corresponding to the lowest 
wage level associated with the locations. 
See new 8 CFR 214.1(h)(8)(iii)(A)(5)(i). For example, if a job involves work in 
two different MSAs, one where the 
proffered salary equals a level I wage 
and one where the proffered salary 
equals a level II wage, the employer 
must submit a registration at level I. 
Failure to do so will result in denial of 
the petition. Whether a change 
represents ‘‘impermissible gaming’’ is 
case specific based on the facts 
presented. USCIS will examine the 
registration and the petition, which 
includes the LCA, to compare the 
offered positions, SOC codes, locations, 
and wage levels, along with the totality 
of the circumstances to determine 
whether the petitioner has established 
that the change in employment is not 
part of an attempt to game the selection 
process and increase the chance of 
selection. 
a. Remote Work Considerations 
Comment: Many commenters specifically addressed remote work 
considerations in the context of gaining 
an unfair advantage in the weighted 
selection process. A commenter said 
that the proposed rule contemplates the 
possibility of someone working at two 
different locations (onsite work plus 
remote work, the hybrid model) but 
does not address the possibility of 
someone working entirely remotely. A 
commenter discussed how an employer 
could apply for a low-cost-of-living 
location and an occupational category 
having a lower wage level to increase 
chances in the lottery, but have the 
beneficiary work remotely in a high- 
cost-of-living location. Similarly, 
another commenter reasoned that an 
employer could list fully remote 
positions in low-wage areas in order to 
claim a level IV wage in a rural 
nonmetropolitan area, thereby offering a 
lower wage but higher chance for the 
beneficiary to be selected. The 
commenter added they could foresee a 
‘‘wave’’ of H–1B registrations claiming 
level IV wages, not because a job 
requires high-level skills or offers truly 
high compensation, but because 
artificial work locations give a statistical 
edge. A commenter said USCIS should 
clarify how remote workers are to be 
treated under the weighted selection 
process, including guidance on 
relocations, wage determination, and 
weight eligibility. Another commenter 
suggested that to prevent gaming of the 
system, wage levels must be binding 
once selected, and remote work should 
default to the primary worksite for 
prevailing wage purposes, and 
misrepresentation should incur strict 
penalties. 
Response: Regardless of whether the work will be performed at an office or 
remotely, the registrant must provide 
the appropriate SOC code of the 
proffered position and the area of 
intended employment that served as the 
basis for the OEWS wage level indicated 
on the registration, in addition to any 
other information required on the 
electronic registration form (and on the 
H–1B petition) as specified in form 
instructions. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(4)(i). The registrant 
must also certify, under penalty of 
perjury, that all of the information 
contained in the registration is true and 
correct. Importantly, if the beneficiary 
will work in multiple locations, the 
registrant must select the lowest 
corresponding OEWS wage level that 
the beneficiary’s proffered wage will 
equal or exceed. Id. This provision removes a potential incentive to inflate 
wage levels through strategic location 
choices, including through remote work, 
to help ensure integrity of the selection 
process. 
The rule also allows USCIS to deny a 
subsequent new or amended petition 
filed by the petitioner, or a related 
entity, on behalf of the same beneficiary 
if USCIS were to determine that the 
filing of the new or amended petition 
was part of the petitioner’s attempt to 
unfairly increase the odds of selection 
during the registration selection process, 
such as by reducing the proffered wage 
to an amount that would be equivalent 
to a lower wage level than that indicated 
on the original registration or petition.

Nothing in this rule changes the Department of 
Labor’s administration and enforcement of statutory 
and regulatory requirements related to labor 
condition applications. 
See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iii). Further, USCIS will deny a petition if it 
determines ‘‘that the statements on the 
petition, H–1B registration (if 
applicable), the application for a 
temporary labor certification, or the 
labor condition application, were 
inaccurate, fraudulent, or 
misrepresented a material fact, 
including if the attestations on the 
registration are determined to be false.’’ 
See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(ii). As such, a petitioner’s misrepresentation of the 
offered position’s location on the LCA, 
registration, or petition is already 
grounds for denial of the petition.
88
 
Additionally, if USCIS discovers that a 
petitioner is violating the terms and 
conditions of the petition (for example, 
employing the beneficiary in a location 
that does not align with the location 
described in the petition, registration, or 
on the LCA), USCIS may revoke the 
petition approval on notice. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(11)(iii). 
6. Multiple Registrations 
Comment: Some commenters stated that companies could submit multiple 
registrations using shell companies or 
subsidiaries to game the weighted 
selection process. Another commenter 
reasoned that employers could 
‘‘manufacture’’ job positions to game the 
system by submitting for multiple job 
applicants, even though there is only 
one position available. 
Response: DHS disagrees that the weighted selection process will allow 
companies to submit multiple 
registrations on behalf of an individual 
alien through subsidiaries or shell 
companies to increase their chance of 
selection. Importantly, the weighted 
selection process is built on the 
beneficiary centric registration selection 
process. All registrations submitted on 
behalf of each unique individual will be 
identified and grouped together. If more 
than one registration is submitted for a 
beneficiary, USCIS will use the lowest 
equivalent wage level provided in any 
of the registrations submitted on that 
individual’s behalf when determining 
the weight to be accorded to that 
beneficiary in the weighted selection 
process. The number of registrations 
submitted on an alien’s behalf does not 
impact the chance of selection. Further, 
the existing registration attestation 
requires an employer to certify that that 
the registration reflects a legitimate job 
offer. Through this rule making, DHS is 
also adding that ‘‘a valid registration 
must represent a bona fide job offer’’ to 
the regulatory language. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(ii). A bona fide job offer is 
one that exists as described on the 
registration and petition and in which 
the employer intends to employ the 
beneficiary. If the employer is 
submitting registrations for different 
individuals for the same job 
opportunity, those registrations do not 
represent a bona fide job offer. As such, 
petitions filed based on these 
registrations would be subject to denial 
or revocation of the petition’s approval. 
See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(ii) and (11)(iii). 7. Related Entities 
Comment: A commenter remarked that the proposed rule references 
‘‘related entity’’ at proposed 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(10)(iii) and (11)(iii)(A)(8) but 
provides only general factors (familial 
ties, proximity, leadership structure), 
and questioned how USCIS would make 
these determinations and if there would 
be guidance or precedent decisions 
published to provide predictability. 
Another commenter expressed similar 
concern, adding that USCIS should 
revise 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(G) to codify 
a clear, enforceable definition for the 
term ‘‘legitimate business need’’ and 
that it should explicitly operate 
pursuant to the objectives of the INA. 
Response: The proposed regulations at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iii) and 
(11)(iii)(A)(8) use the term ‘‘related 
entity’’ as it has been understood and 
applied in the H–1B program for many 
years. The term is not new and USCIS 
issued policy guidance on this term in 
Matter of S- Inc., Adopted Decision 
2018–02 (AAO Mar. 23, 2018). 
Therefore, proposed 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(10)(iii) and (11)(iii)(A)(8) will 
be finalized without change. DHS did 
not propose to amend the regulation at 
8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(G) and DHS will 
not modify that provision in the final 
rule. Like the term ‘‘related entity,’’ the 
term ‘‘legitimate business need’’ is not 
new and was likewise explained in 
USCIS-issued policy guidance Matter of 
S- Inc., Adopted Decision 2018–02 
(AAO Mar. 23, 2018). 
8. Other Comments Related to Process 
Integrity 
Comment: A commenter referenced proposed 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iii), stating 
the proposed rule only provides one 
example of attempting to ‘‘unfairly 
increase the odds of selection’’ 
(reducing the proffered wage to a lower 
wage level). The commenter questioned 
what other scenarios would trigger this 
provision, and how USCIS would 
provide notice and opportunity to 
respond before making such 
determinations. A commenter expressed 
that the proposed rule’s integrity 
provisions would create particularly 
severe problems by allowing USCIS to 
deny or revoke petitions based on 
subjective determinations about 
whether changes between registration 
and petition represent attempts to 
‘‘unfairly increase the odds of 
selection.’’ The commenter added that 
the proposed rule provides limited 
guidance about what types of changes 
would be permissible versus 
impermissible. A different commenter 
suggested that the proposed rule would 
allow USCIS to deny a petition or 
revoke a petition approval if it appears 
the petitioner made a subsequent 
change to wage level after selection as 
evidence of inconsistency, even when 
ordinary business conditions may 
explain the adjustment. 
Response: Whether an employer has attempted to unfairly increase the odds 
of selection is a case specific 
determination based on the facts in the 
record. USCIS will examine the 
registration, the original petition, and 
any subsequent petition to compare the 
offered positions, SOC codes, locations, 
and wage levels, along with the totality 
of the circumstances to determine 
whether the petitioner has established 
that the change in employment is not 
part of an attempt to game the selection 
process and increase the chance of 
selection. 
As explained in the proposed rule, the 
petition must contain and be supported 
by the same identifying information and 
position information, including SOC 
code, provided in the selected 
registration and indicated on the LCA 
used to support the petition. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(1). The petition 
must also include a proffered wage that 
equals or exceeds the prevailing wage 
for the corresponding OEWS wage level 
in the registration for the SOC code in 
the area(s) of intended employment. See 
new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(1). USCIS 
may deny or revoke the approval of an 
H–1B petition that does not meet these 
requirements. However, in its 
discretion, USCIS may find that a 
change in the area(s) of intended 
employment between registration 
submission and petition filing is 
permissible, provided such change is 
consistent with the requirement of a 
bona fide job offer at the time of 
registration. 
For changes between an initial 
petition and subsequent new or 
amended petitions filed by the 
petitioner or a related entity, if the 
petition would lower the wage level that 
would have been selected in 
registration, USCIS would scrutinize

Comment: Numerous commenters expressed concerns regarding fraud and 
system abuse in the H–1B program as it 
relates to this rule. A few commenters 
remarked that the existing random, 
beneficiary-centric lottery, while 
imperfect, treats all registrants equally 
and avoids inequities and potential 
loopholes. Many commenters expressed 
concern that the proposed weighted 
selection process would do nothing to 
fix the systemic fraud and abuse issues 
in the H–1B program. 
A commenter stated that USCIS has 
already established mechanisms for 
guarding against fraud and 
misrepresentation, and that the 
proposed rule would provide minimal 
benefit regarding program integrity, 
while disproportionately increasing the 
risk of penalizing employers for 
unavoidable discrepancies. Another 
commenter voiced opposition to the 
proposed rule and expressed that the 
proposed rule is a ‘‘half measure’’ to fix 
a system that harms U.S workers’ 
careers by prioritizing foreign labor. 
Another commenter suggested that 
without modernizing the visa cap and 
improving administrative efficiency, a 
wage-based selection process will only 
deepen existing challenges. 
A commenter voiced concern about 
whether the proposed rule would 
adequately address fraud and 
enforcement, stating that vague 
provisions around wage calculation and 
job tracking could enable manipulation. 
Another commenter questioned whether 
the rule provides sufficient procedural 
clarity, remarking on the lack of detail 
on wage enforcement, worksite 
transfers, and post-approval wage 
amendments. A commenter expressed 
general concern about fraud in the H– 
1B program and questioned whether 
USCIS could effectively manage this 
issue. Similarly, another commenter 
said that USCIS and DOL lack the 
capacity to verify beneficiary 
qualifications and that the proposed 
rule could increase financial incentives 
to exploit the program through falsified 
credentials and kickback schemes. 
Response: DHS agrees that enhancing the integrity of the H–1B program is 
important. This narrowly scoped rule 
seeks to build on the success of the 
beneficiary-centric registration selection 
process to reduce registration fraud 
while at the same time achieving the 
policy goal of incentivizing employers 
to use the H–1B program to employ 
highly paid, highly skilled workers. The 
rule includes provisions to prevent 
gaming of the weighted selection 
process as detailed previously, 
including provisions governing changes 
in wage, location, and position, as well 
as provisions addressing changes in 
amended petitions. Additionally, 
existing regulations also allow USCIS to 
address fraud or misrepresentation in 
the registration, LCA, or petition process 
through denial or approval revocation. 
Further, where USCIS determines that 
an employer is attempting to subvert the 
weighted selection process and has 
submitted false attestations, USCIS may 
refer the individual or entity who 
submitted a false attestation to 
appropriate Federal law enforcement 
agencies for investigation and further 
action, as appropriate. Although DHS 
declines to add additional anti-fraud 
provisions to this narrowly scoped rule, 
DHS will continue to look for ways to 
improve the H–1B program and to 
protect the interests of U.S. workers. 
Comment: A commenter remarked that a result of the proposed rule could 
be the increased use of alternative visa 
categories and employment structures to 
avoid H–1B restrictions. The commenter 
suggested, for example, that employers 
unable to secure H–1B workers at 
desired wage levels might increase use 
of L–1 intracompany transferee visas, 
O–1 extraordinary ability visas, or other 
categories not subject to the numerical 
cap or wage-based selection. 
Response: DHS is focused on ensuring the integrity of all the employment- 
based classifications and will continue 
to carefully adjudicate all benefit 
requests. Although DHS is aware of 
employers and individuals filing 
frivolous petitions for which they are 
not qualified, it is possible that an alien 
and his or her employer would qualify 
under more than one nonimmigrant 
classification. Moreover, the goal of this 
rule is to enhance the H–1B cap 
selection process, not to prevent aliens 
from seeking other classifications for 
which they may be eligible. 
F. Other Issues Relating to the Rule 
1. Alternatives to the Proposed 
Weighted Selection Process 
a. Recommendations To Weight Wage 
Levels More Heavily 
Comment: Some commenters expressed a preference for the wage- 
based approach that DHS finalized in 
2021. Under that approach, DHS would 
adopt a selection process that would be 
fully determined by wage level, starting 
with selecting all level IV registrations 
and proceeding sequentially to levels III, 
II, and I only if the cap were not met. 
If, at any wage level, the number of 
applicants exceeds the remaining cap, 
then a random lottery should be 
conducted only among that wage level. 
Some commenters asserted that, while 
the proposed weighted approach would 
still be a notable improvement from the 
status quo, it would be less effective at 
protecting the interests of U.S. and 
foreign workers than the approach 
described in the 2021 final rule. 
Another commenter advocated for a 
‘‘wage-based allocation system’’ 
modelled on the 2021 rule stating that 
that system would advantage direct-hire 
employers, including start-ups and 
small businesses, and more effectively 
improve the H–1B visa allocation 
process in comparison to the proposed 
weighted selection. A different 
commenter stated that the proposed rule 
is insufficient to address the issues 
caused by the random lottery and 
provided several reasons why it 
preferred the 2021 rule, including: this 
rule still retains the element of 
randomness while the 2021 rule created 
more certainty; this rule will only 
minimally raise the median salary of H– 
1B workers compared to the 2021 rule; 
this rule still allows outsourcing firms 
to benefit; and the 2021 rule provided 
more benefits to U.S. early-career 
workers who would face reduced 
competition from H–1B workers. 
Response: While the approach in the 2021 final rule was reasonable to 
facilitate the admission of higher-skilled 
or higher-paid workers, that rule did not 
capture the optimal approach. DHS 
believes that the weighted selection 
process as proposed in the NPRM and 
being finalized in this rule is the 
optimal approach because it increases 
the chance of selection for beneficiaries 
who will be paid a wage that 
corresponds to a higher wage level 
while not excluding those at lower wage 
levels, unlike the 2021 final rule. While 
DHS prefers that cap-subject H–1B visas 
be allocated in a manner that favors 
higher-paid, higher-skilled beneficiaries, 
DHS also recognizes the value in 
maintaining the opportunity for 
employers to secure H–1B workers at all 
wage levels. DHS believes that this rule 
appropriately balances the interests of 
U.S. workers with the interests of 
petitioning employers and the alien 
workers they seek to employ as H–1B 
nonimmigrants. 
Comment: Commenters provided various alternatives that would 
prioritize registrations for higher level 
wages while giving less weight to 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:36 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\29DER2.SGM 29DER2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260913 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations registrations for lower wage levels than 
proposed. These commenters generally 
reasoned that level I and II workers have 
fewer skills, are more likely used by 
consulting companies to replace higher- 
paid U.S. employees, and that 
prioritizing level IV registrations would 
be truer to the original purpose of the 
H–1B program since workers at higher 
wage levels better reflect Congress’ 
intended recipients of H–1B visas as 
high-skilled, high-wage workers, among 
other reasons. For example, many 
commenters recommended that level IV 
registrations should have much higher 
chances of selection than just four 
times, whereas level I and II 
registrations should have much lower 
chances. Others recommended an 
allocation framework involving ‘‘pools’’ 
or ‘‘caps’’ for each wage level, wherein 
the allocation for level IV registrations 
would be the highest and would 
decrease in order of the remaining wage 
levels. 
Response: DHS appreciates these suggestions but believes that the 
weighted selection process proposed in 
the NPRM and finalized in this rule is 
a reasonable approach because it 
increases the chance of selection for 
beneficiaries who will be paid a wage 
that corresponds to a higher wage level 
while not entirely excluding those at 
lower wage levels. With regard to the 
asserted benefits of the proposed 
alternatives, DHS believes the approach 
in this final rule similarly offers these 
benefits with respect to incentivizing 
higher wages, mitigating unfair 
competition to U.S. workers, and 
providing greater access to visas for 
higher-paid, higher-skilled beneficiaries. 
Comment: A couple of commenters suggested that DHS should ensure 100% 
selection or guarantee ‘‘approval’’ of all 
level IV registrations. Likewise, some 
commenters recommended guaranteeing 
selection for levels III and IV, while 
excluding levels I and/or II entirely. 
Response: It is unclear whether the commenters were suggesting guaranteed 
petition approval or guaranteed 
selection in the registration process for 
aliens at higher wage levels. In either 
case, DHS declines to adopt this 
suggestion. USCIS does not adjudicate 
registrations. Additionally, DHS 
declines to ensure 100% petition 
approval or guaranteed work visas to all 
aliens at certain wage levels. It is 
possible that the number of prospective 
alien H–1B beneficiaries at levels III and 
IV could exceed congressionally 
established numerical limitations. 
Additionally, USCIS adjudicates every 
petition to ensure eligibility and does 
not offer blanket guaranteed approvals, 
regardless of proffered wage or wage 
level. DHS believes the proposed 
approach of weighting registrations (or 
petitions, as applicable) for selection 
based on a beneficiary’s equivalent wage 
levels meets the goal of favoring higher- 
skilled and higher-paid aliens, while 
still ensuring the integrity of the 
registration process (or petition filing 
process, as applicable). 
Regarding the commenters’ 
suggestions to entirely exclude lower 
wage levels from the selection process, 
DHS prefers a weighted selection 
process that does not effectively 
eliminate the odds of selection for wage 
levels I and II. DHS reiterates that this 
rule strikes an appropriate balance 
between prioritizing high wage levels 
while also recognizing the value in 
maintaining the opportunity for 
employers to secure H–1B workers at all 
wage levels. This rule also preserves the 
opportunity for employers utilizing non- 
OEWS wage sources to be selected. DHS 
recognizes that there may be some 
occupations or geographic areas for 
which OEWS wage data is not available, 
or positions for which a private wage 
survey or CBA may be used to 
determine the required wage. In these 
cases, the registration might be assigned 
a level I wage and as such would be 
effectively precluded if registrations at 
lower wage levels were excluded. DHS 
believes that the weighted selection 
process finalized in this rule is optimal 
because it increases the chance of 
selection for those with wages that 
correspond to higher wage levels but 
does not effectively preclude 
beneficiaries from being selected solely 
because of variables, including OEWS 
data limitations. DHS believes that this 
rule appropriately balances the interests 
of U.S. workers with the interests of 
petitioning employers and the alien 
workers they seek to employ as H–1B 
nonimmigrants. 
Comment: A commenter stated that DHS must cap the number of level I 
registrations, or else the weighted 
registration system would continue to 
have issues. The commenter reasoned 
that employers could still 
‘‘manufacture’’ job positions to game the 
system by submitting for multiple 
beneficiaries at low wage levels, 
therefore making it even less likely that 
higher wage levels would be selected. 
Response: DHS appreciates the commenter’s concern for potential 
gaming in the manner described. It is 
theoretically possible that all registrants 
will collude with each other to submit 
only level I registrations, such that this 
rule would not have the intended 
impact of incentivizing employers to 
hire higher-skilled H–1B workers. 
However, DHS does not believe this 
scenario to be likely. Further, under the 
existing registration process, all 
registrants must certify that: each 
registration represents a legitimate job 
offer; all of the information contained in 
the submission is complete, true and 
correct; and that they have not worked 
with or agreed to work with another 
registrant, petitioner, agent, or other 
individual or entity to submit a 
registration to unfairly increase a 
beneficiary’s chances of selection. If 
DHS discovers that any of these 
certifications are not true, DHS may 
deny or revoke the petition based on the 
underlying registration and potentially 
pursue other appropriate action. 
Through this rulemaking, DHS is also 
adding that ‘‘a valid registration must 
represent a bona fide job offer’’ to the 
regulatory language (see new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(ii)) and updating the 
registration attestation regarding a 
legitimate job offer to attest to a ‘‘bona 
fide job offer.’’ These provisions should 
further deter any registrant from 
colluding with other registrants to 
manipulate wage levels during the 
registration stage, thus rendering a cap 
on the number of level I registrations 
unnecessary. 
b. Recommendations To Select or 
Weight by Highest Salary, Not Wage 
Level 
Comment: Many commenters recommended allocating all H–1B visas 
by the highest offered salaries rather 
than wage levels. Allocating by salary 
would guarantee that the highest offered 
salaries would be selected, without any 
random lottery elements. The 
commenters generally explained that 
this alternative would ensure that the 
rule better advances the objectives DHS 
laid out in the NPRM of increasing the 
share of H–1Bs going to high-skilled, 
high-paid workers, and better aligns 
with the program’s intent to fill 
specialized positions while ensuring fair 
compensation that does not undercut 
domestic wages, among other reasons. A 
commenter similarly wrote that a wage- 
based system would provide greater 
employer certainty, incentivize 
competitive wages, advantage direct- 
hire employers over outsourcing firms, 
and increase opportunities for 
international graduates from U.S. 
institutions. Another commenter 
explained that allocating visas 
according to wage would yield a more 
precise reflection of current market 
demand and better reward petitioners 
who pay compensation that reflects 
market demand. Some commenters 
stated that actual salary is a better 
measure of skill rather than wage level, 
and cited research that, according to the 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:36 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\29DER2.SGM 29DER2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260914 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations commenters, showed that the proposed 
rule would increase median H–1B salary 
by 3 percent, while a compensation- 
based system could lead to a 52 percent 
increase. A commenter stated that 
ranking by salary would alleviate 
uncertainty and decrease the likelihood 
of fraud by companies miscoding or 
misclassifying their sponsored workers. 
Conversely, another commenter 
expressed opposition to other 
commenters’ proposals for a selection 
method based solely on salary. The 
commenter stated that under the pure 
salary-based allocation system, they 
would expect a greater share of H–1B 
visas being allocated to computer and 
engineering occupations in high cost-of- 
living urban and coastal areas. The 
commenter reasoned that this would 
undermine the H–1B program’s goals, 
since such occupations are not 
experiencing labor shortages. 
Furthermore, the commenter remarked 
that this kind of salary-based allocation 
system would be clearly inconsistent 
with the statute, and that since all 
occupations have value, the H–1B 
program should not use an allocation 
system that would mostly award visas to 
tech companies 
Response: DHS declines the suggestions to select registrations purely 
based on the highest salary. DHS 
believes that selecting registrations or 
petitions, as applicable, solely based on 
the highest salary would unfairly favor 
certain professions, industries, or 
geographic locations, such as computer 
and engineering occupations in high 
cost-of-living urban areas as mentioned 
by a commenter. DHS believes that 
prioritizing generally based on the 
highest OEWS wage level that the 
proffered wage equals or exceeds for the 
relevant SOC code and in the area of 
intended employment is the better 
alternative. While DHS appreciates the 
commenter’s concerns about the need to 
alleviate uncertainty for employers, 
DHS also needs to balance this with the 
countervailing interest H–1B employers 
have in maintaining the opportunity to 
secure workers at all wage levels in all 
eligible occupations, and without 
introducing unintended preference for 
geographical locations. 
DHS is also concerned about 
miscoding or misclassifying through 
SOC code manipulation but believes it 
has sufficient enforcement mechanisms 
in place to deter and penalize such 
behavior. DHS must also balance the 
concerns for SOC code manipulation 
with the concerns of potentially 
shutting out entire professions, 
industries, or geographic locations that 
happen to be lower paying. 
Regarding the comments that this rule 
would not sufficiently increase the 
median H–1B salary, DHS appreciates 
these concerns but notes that the 
primary goal of this rule is to generally 
favor the allocation of H–1B visas to 
higher-skilled and higher-paid aliens, 
while maintaining the opportunity for 
employers to secure H–1B workers at all 
wage levels, to better serve the 
congressional intent for the H–1B 
program. Moving to a weighted 
selection process is expected to increase 
the number and share of equivalent 
level IV wage selections, resulting in 
higher average offered wages among 
selected H–1B cap-subject workers. 
While the expected increase to average 
H–1B wages may not be as much as the 
increase that might result from the 
compensation-based selection system 
advocated by these commenters, DHS 
considered the disadvantages of such an 
alternative, e.g., unfairly favoring certain professions, industries, or 
geographic locations, to outweigh the 
benefits. 
c. Recommendations To Account for 
Geographic Differences 
Comment: Commenters provided various recommendations to adjust 
wages or wage levels to account for 
geographic differences. These 
recommendations included: considering 
national benchmarks or adjusted 
weighting to avoid disadvantaging 
beneficiaries in major metro areas; apply 
a nationally uniform wage-level 
standard to better reflect the value of 
high-skilled labor; set wage limits based 
on the highest wage levels in the State 
where a business operates (with the 
example that entry-level programmer 
salaries in states like California or 
Washington are typically at least 30 
percent higher than in Midwestern 
states, such as Michigan); normalize 
wage levels across regions; adjust wage 
levels based on local statistical areas; 
normalize wages for cost-of-living or 
purchasing power parity; and 
incorporate cost-of-living or regional 
adjustments into the weighting model so 
the rule is consistent for high-skilled 
workers in all U.S. regions. 
Response: DHS declines to adopt these alternatives. This final rule 
neutralizes geographic differences in 
salary amounts by taking into account 
the area of intended employment when 
weighting registrations. DHS disagrees 
that additional adjustments for national 
benchmarks or a nationwide wage-level 
standard would improve the proposed 
weighted selection process, or that it is 
necessary to set wage limits based on 
the State where the business operates. 
Similarly, DHS does not believe that 
normalizing wages across regions, or 
adjusting wages based on local 
statistical areas is necessary, and such 
recommendations related to the 
prevailing wage system go beyond 
DHS’s expertise. While DHS appreciates 
the additional recommendations, DHS 
does not believe that they are necessary 
or feasible to incorporate into a 
weighted selection process that is 
efficient to administer in a fair and 
effective way. 
d. Recommendations To Account for 
Multiple Factors 
Comment: A few commenters suggested that DHS could make 
adjustments to salary to account for 
various factors. A commenter said that 
if directly weighting salaries, DHS could 
adjust for various factors, including: age 
and experience to ensure that workers 
who are early in their careers (who may 
earn less, but are likely to make larger 
economic contributions over their 
careers), are still able to get H–1B visas, 
or alternatively, to prioritize workers 
with higher skill levels by assigning 
weights based on applicants’ highest 
degree and major field, with larger 
weights for advanced degree holders in 
science and engineering majors. One 
commenter stated that a salary-based 
selection could be adjusted to select 
high-earning, high-value workers by 
projecting earnings over a lifetime, for 
example, through adjusting for age by 
taking the net present value of the 
discounted future earnings stream. A 
different commenter recommended 
using actual wages paid rather than 
wage levels as the selection metric, 
potentially adjusted for geography and 
age. The commenter provided analysis 
that they characterized as showing that 
this approach would decrease H–1B 
outsourcing while increasing the share 
going to F–1 students, especially Ph.D.s. 
The commenter added that such a 
system would be harder to game than 
wage levels and better achieve the 
agency’s goals. A commenter suggested 
normalizing wages nationally by 
adjusting for cost of living and region, 
calculating an adjusted ‘‘national 
equivalent’’ wage percentile to ensure 
fairness across geographic regions. 
Another commenter similarly requested 
that DHS recognize regional differences 
in wage structures so that businesses 
outside major cities are not unfairly 
excluded. Some commenters 
recommended tying H–1B pay scales to 
inflation. Another commenter suggested 
prioritizing by wages while also 
implementing weighted adjustments for 
designated critical shortage 
occupations—such as healthcare 
providers in medically underserved 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:36 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\29DER2.SGM 29DER2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260915 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations communities, teachers in low-income 
school districts, and national security- 
relevant technical occupations in lower- 
cost regions—determined in 
coordination with certain government 
agencies. 
Response: DHS believes that selecting registrations (or petitions, as applicable) 
based on the highest salary would 
unfairly favor certain professions, 
industries, or geographic locations. DHS 
believes that prioritizing generally based 
on the highest OEWS wage level that the 
proffered wage equals or exceeds for the 
relevant SOC code and in the area of 
intended employment is the better 
alternative. 
DHS also believes that combining and 
weighing multiple factors is not feasible, 
as such an approach could be overly 
complicated, unpredictable, and 
subjective. DHS believes that 
incorporating adjustments based on 
multiple factors, such as the geographic 
area, cost of living, the beneficiary’s age, 
projected earnings over a lifetime, and 
inflation would add unnecessary 
complexity into the process and 
frustrate the goal of administering the 
cap selection process in an efficient and 
effective manner. Some of these factors 
could change over time or may be 
subjective, which increases the chance 
of unpredictability and undermines 
some of the commenters’ concerns about 
the need for predictability. Therefore, 
DHS prefers to use the OEWS wage level 
system that is already used in the H–1B 
program, publicly accessible, and 
updated annually by DOL. DHS further 
notes that the OEWS prevailing wage 
already takes into consideration 
variations in wages due to different 
occupations and geographic locations. 
Regarding the suggestion to reserve 
visas or otherwise adjust weighting for 
critical shortage occupations in the 
healthcare industry, DHS believes that 
employers should be able to utilize the 
H–1B program within a broad range of 
occupations and industries. Further, 
DHS reiterates that H–1B petitions for 
aliens who are employed by, or have 
received offers of employment at, U.S 
institutions of higher education, 
nonprofit entities related to or affiliated 
with U.S. institutions of higher 
education, or nonprofit research 
organizations or governmental research 
organizations are exempt from the H–1B 
cap. See INA sec. 214(g)(5), 8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(5). Many employers and aliens 
in the healthcare industry described by 
this commenter would be cap-exempt 
and therefore not impacted by this rule. 
In the scenarios where such aliens are 
not cap-exempt, DHS believes this rule 
will have a positive impact by 
increasing the chance of selection for 
higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign 
workers for employers in all industries 
and encouraging employers to hire U.S. 
workers. 
Comment: A commenter suggested that DHS should weight by the OEWS 
wage level that corresponds to the 
requirements of the position, rather than 
focusing on the salary being paid. The 
commenter said that this method would 
ensure that the most highly skilled and 
talented employees have the highest 
odds of selection, rather than 
incentivizing employers to artificially 
increase wages regardless of the skill 
requirements of the position. 
Response: DHS continues to believe that salary, as demonstrated by the 
equivalent OEWS wage level, remains 
the better proxy for skill. Relying only 
on the OEWS wage level for each 
petition, as determined by the 
education, skill and responsibility 
required for each position, would only 
reflect the requirements for a position 
and would not necessarily benefit an 
employer seeking to hire the most 
talented candidate for a position, which 
undermines the primary purpose of this 
rule. 
e. Recommendations To Preserve 
Opportunity for Lower Wage Levels 
Comment: A few commenters expressed the need to preserve 
opportunity for all wage levels to be 
selected, claiming that the rule will 
disproportionately advantage level IV 
registrations. The commenters provided 
various alternatives intended to mitigate 
the risk of overconcentration and 
preserve fair competition across wage 
levels, including: capping the number of 
weighted entries assigned to higher 
wage positions; setting a maximum 
selection weight to avoid giving higher 
wage levels an ‘‘overwhelming’’ 
advantage; setting a proportional 
selection floor or tiered quota that 
would ensure opportunity for all wage 
levels; reserving a proportion of H–1B 
visas for recent graduates as level I and 
II applicants, or at each wage level; and 
increasing the selection chances for 
level II applicants to ensure equitable 
access for talented professionals across 
all wage levels. 
Response: DHS declines to adopt these suggestions, as the goal of this rule 
is to implement a weighted selection 
process that would generally favor the 
allocation of H–1B visas to higher- 
skilled and higher-paid aliens. Further, 
this rule already preserves the chance 
that registrations with wages 
corresponding to any one of the four 
wage levels may be selected. As stated 
in Table 13 of the NPRM and the 
analysis accompanying this final rule, 
this rule is expected to provide an 
estimated 89,911 level I registrations a 
15.29% chance of selection and an 
estimated 177,216 level II registrations a 
30.58% chance of selection based on a 
simple weighted-probability calculation. 
While the Monte Carlo simulation may 
be more difficult for some commenters 
to interpret, the results presented in row 
F of Table 13 show an estimated 15,330 
selected registrants out of 89,911 for 
level I, reflecting a slightly higher 
probability than the calculated 15.29%. 
Because the Monte Carlo simulation 
accounts for non-replacement in the 
selection process, the probabilities will 
be closer to the simple weighted 
probability but not exact. DHS believes 
this result, summarized in row F of 
Table 13, is sufficient to address the 
commenters’ concerns about ensuring 
opportunity for all corresponding wage 
levels. 
f. Recommendations To Set Minimum 
Salaries for Each Wage Level 
Comment: Numerous commenters proposed setting various minimum 
salaries for each wage level. The 
commenters’ suggestions varied widely, 
requesting DHS to set the level I 
minimum salary as low as $120,000 per 
year to as high as $175,000 per year, and 
the level IV minimum salary to be as 
low as $250,000 per year to as high as 
$800,000 per year. 
Response: DHS declines the suggestions to set minimum salaries for 
each wage level. The weighted selection 
process will use the OEWS wage levels, 
which is already used in the H–1B 
program, publicly accessible, and 
updated annually. Importantly, OEWS 
prevailing wages and wage levels are set 
by DOL. DHS does not have the 
expertise nor manpower to create an 
entirely new prevailing wage system 
that would need to be regularly 
updated, so this is not a feasible 
alternative. 
g. Recommendations Regarding SOC 
Codes 
Comment: Some commenters cautioned that weighting by wages 
could unfairly weight identical SOC 
codes differently based on location. The 
commenters recommended DHS weight 
offers by SOC codes and ‘‘local SOC 
percentile’’ so that offers that are 
equally competitive for their respective 
location receive the same lottery weight, 
regardless of location. Likewise, a 
commenter noted that the proposed 
weighting approach could unfairly 
disadvantage professionals in certain 
occupations and locations; this 
commenter recommended that USCIS

weight wages within each occupation 
rather than across all fields. 
Response: DHS believes that the weighted selection process proposed in 
the NPRM and finalized in this rule 
addresses the concerns raised by these 
commenters. Wage levels are based on 
the OEWS survey wage distribution for 
a specific occupation and location, with 
wage level I currently set at 
approximately the 17th percentile of the 
OEWS wage distribution for the relevant 
occupation in the relevant location, 
wage level II set at approximately the 
34th percentile, wage level III set at 
approximately the 50th percentile, and 
wage level IV set at approximately the 
67th percentile. 90 FR 45986, 45990 
(Sept. 24, 2025). Accordingly, by using 
wage levels, the weighted selection 
process takes into consideration 
variations in wages due to different 
occupations and geographic locations 
and avoids favoring particular 
occupations or locations. 
h. Recommendation Regarding Four- 
Digit SOC Codes 
Comment: In order to mitigate the adverse effects of occupational 
misclassification during registration, a 
commenter recommended that 
employers use a four-digit, instead of a 
six-digit, SOC code to identify the wage 
level for registration purposes. 
According to this commenter, 
employers would select the six-digit 
occupation with the highest median 
wage within its four-digit SOC family, 
and then map their proffered wage to 
the corresponding wage level. For 
example, applications with any 
computer occupation (15–12XX) would 
map their wage levels to 15–1221, 
Computer and Information Research 
Scientists. The commenter concluded 
that correcting occupational 
misclassification this way is analogous 
to the proposed rule’s handling of 
multiple worksite locations and would 
prevent gaming of the weighted 
selection process through the selection 
of favorable SOC codes. 
Response: DHS is also concerned with employers gaming the system through 
SOC codes and appreciates this 
suggestion. However, selecting the six- 
digit occupation with the highest 
median wage within its four-digit SOC 
family code—rather than the six-digit 
SOC code corresponding to the nature of 
the job offer—could cause confusion for 
stakeholders as it deviates from long-

DHS believes there are 
sufficient provisions to detect and deter 
occupational misclassification during 
registration and declines this 
suggestion. 
i. Recommendations Related to U.S. 
Education 
Comment: Commenters provided various suggestions on how to prioritize 
registrations based on a prospective 
beneficiary’s U.S. education or degree. 
Some commenters suggested prioritizing 
graduates from U.S. universities 
regardless of their starting salary level. 
To retain talent at all levels, several 
commenters suggested giving additional 
weight or preference to graduates of U.S. 
institutions, with some commenters 
suggesting extra consideration for 
graduates of top-tier schools, graduates 
completing U.S. master’s or higher 
degrees, or graduates of highly ranked 
U.S. universities. These commenters 
reasoned that the selection process 
should reward individuals who are 
already invested in U.S. institutions, 
and have paid high amounts of tuition 
and undergone a rigorous admission 
process, and successfully assimilated 
into U.S. culture and values. Some 
commenters specifically recommended 
that DHS give priority to individuals 
who have completed OPT in the United 
States or who are in F–1 status. 
Some commenters recommended 
exempting registrations towards the 
master’s degree cap from the proposed 
wage-based weighting. Other 
commenters wrote that only 
beneficiaries with Ph.D.s should be 
admitted, or that beneficiaries with 
Ph.D.s should automatically be assigned 
to level IV in the registration. A 
commenter proposed a qualification- 
based allocation system that would 
assign higher selection priority to Ph.D. 
holders, followed by master’s degree 
holders, and then bachelor’s degree 
holders. 
Some commenters suggested 
prioritizing applicants with U.S. degrees 
in STEM fields. A commenter 
recommended, as one potential 
alternative to the proposed wage- 
weighted selection process, that DHS 
apply weighting by education level with 
higher weights for advanced degrees, 
particularly in STEM fields, to prioritize 
beneficiaries whose skills most closely 
align with U.S. economic needs, 
reasoning that this would avoid 
distortions inherent to a percentile- 
based OEWS wage level weighting. 
More specifically, another commenter 
recommended awarding one additional 
registration chance to U.S.-educated 
applicants who submit a registration 
within 12 months of graduation, with a 
second additional chance for graduates 
in critical STEM fields identified by the 
administration. Some commenters 
recommended exempting or otherwise 
prioritizing STEM Ph.D.s, to ensure 
intelligent individuals, invested in the 
U.S. education system, are able to 
contribute to the United States, even if 
they have low wages. 
Response: DHS declines these suggestions to further prioritize 
registrations based on a prospective 
beneficiary’s U.S. education or degree. 
Registrations or petitions, as applicable, 
submitted for beneficiaries who have 
earned a master’s or higher degree from 
a U.S. institution of higher education 
already have a higher chance of 
selection through the administration of 
the selection process. DHS has already 
reversed the order in which USCIS 
selects registrations or petitions, as 
applicable, which resulted in an 
increase in the number of H–1B 
beneficiaries with a master’s degree or 
higher from a U.S. institution of higher 
education selected.
90
 
DHS declines to adopt the suggestion 
to give every F–1 graduate an equal 
entry-level opportunity, as this goes 
against the stated goal of the rule, which 
is to generally favor the allocation of H– 
1B visas to higher-skilled and higher- 
paid aliens. DHS also declines to ensure 
that U.S.-educated recent graduates, 
including those in critical fields, are 
given increased weighting in the 
selection process. The weighted 
selection process discussed in the 
NPRM is intended to incentivize 
employers to pay a higher proffered 
wage to a certain beneficiary to be more 
competitive in the H–1B selection 
process. 90 FR 45986, 45990 (Sept. 24, 
2025). This process also maintains the 
opportunity for employers to secure H– 
1B workers at all wage levels, thus it 
will not completely leave out aliens in 
entry-level positions. Similarly, DHS 
declines to give priority to aliens who 
completed OPT in the United States. 
DHS believes that prioritizing an alien 
based on their degree field, including 
whether their degree is from a STEM 
field, is not necessary. The purpose of 
this rule is not to prioritize the 
admission of foreign STEM workers. 
Further, DHS generally notes that 
prioritizing registrations on multiple

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260917 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations characteristics—for example, a STEM 
degree plus an advanced degree—is not 
feasible, as such an approach could be 
overly complicated, unpredictable, and 
subjective. Therefore, DHS declines to 
adopt the commenters’ suggestions. 
Comment: Some commenters recommended exempting international 
students who have graduated from U.S. 
institutions from the visa cap or wage 
selection requirements, or both. Another 
commenter recommended using a 
lottery system for graduates already in 
the United States and only applying 
wage-based selection to beneficiaries 
outside the United States. One 
commenter stated support for expanding 
and preserving the advanced degree 
exemption selection. 
Response: DHS did not propose exempting students who have graduated 
from U.S. institutions from the cap or 
granting this group a carve-out from the 
proposed rule and declines to do so 
now. However, many students may 
already qualify for the annual, 
numerically limited exemption from the 
65,000 cap for H–1B workers who have 
earned a qualifying U.S. master’s or 
higher degree. See INA sec. 214(g)(5)(C), 8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(5)(C). DHS does not 
have the authority to expand this 
congressionally created, numerically 
limited exemption. 
j. Recommendations Related to 
Particular Industries, Occupations, and 
Employer Sizes 
Comment: Commenters expressed concerns that the wage-based approach 
does not account for wage variations 
across various industries and sectors. 
For example, some commenters 
recommended that DHS consider 
additional weighting for registrations in 
‘‘critical sectors’’ or ‘‘essential 
industries’’ such as AI, quantum 
computing, semiconductors, 
cybersecurity, aerospace, and 
healthcare. Other commenters proposed 
implementing industry carve-outs or 
quotas for ‘‘critical sectors’’ to ensure 
that these roles are prioritized over 
others. 
Some commenters requested 
alternatives specific to the tech 
industry. For example, a commenter 
said the proposed weighting approach 
should only apply to the tech industry 
where employers can afford high wages, 
while registrations from all other 
industries should be weighted as level 
IV by default. Other commenters 
recommended disallowing level I or II 
registrations from tech industry 
companies, and some commenters 
recommended revising the rule to 
ensure that it does not unfairly favor the 
IT industry. 
Several commenters noted that certain 
industries like manufacturing or some 
engineering fields generally pay lower 
salaries compared to other industries, 
such as the tech industry, and 
recommended that H–1B visa slots be 
allocated by industry, rather than 
through a general pool. A commenter 
urged USCIS to adapt the proposed rule 
to mitigate negative effects on the 
manufacturing sector, particularly by 
reserving a portion of the cap or 
enhancing selection odds for lottery 
registrations for small and medium- 
sized manufacturers applying for H–1B 
visas for engineering and similar roles. 
Other commenters expressed concern 
that the proposed rule disadvantages 
employers in lower paying, non-tech 
sectors, and recommended various 
measures, such as bonus weighting or 
special carve-outs. Commenters said the 
proposed approach may unfairly 
disadvantage public sector and local 
government functions where wages are 
typically lower. A commenter expressed 
concern about the proposed rule’s effect 
on school districts’ ability to address 
staffing shortages amid a national 
teacher shortage and recommended DHS 
prioritize K–12 teaching as a priority 
occupation eligible for additional 
weighting. A commenter suggested 
prioritizing teachers, especially in areas 
of shortage, such as math and science. 
Other commenters suggested various 
alternatives for universities, nonprofits, 
and research institutions, as well as for 
small employers and startups. These 
commenters indicated that these 
alternative weighting methods would 
help ensure employers are not 
disadvantaged solely because they are 
unable to pay high salaries compared to 
other employers. 
Commenters suggested exceptions for 
their industry, such as exempting all 
alien physicians from the rule’s 
weighted selection process, or weighting 
all healthcare workers at wage level IV. 
Another commenter generally 
recommended exempting all doctors 
and nurses from the proposed rule. 
Several commenters requested special 
consideration for healthcare 
professionals in underserved and rural 
areas. For example, a commenter 
recommended implementing exceptions 
for physicians practicing in shortage 
areas and in lower-paying but needed 
specialties like primary care. Another 
commenter suggested that DHS consider 
special weighting or exemption for 
healthcare occupations designated by 
DOL as shortage occupations or listed 
on Schedule A. A different commenter 
recommended adjusting the weighting 
formula for occupations where 
supervised clinical training is required, 
including for occupational and physical 
therapists, noting that the healthcare 
field depends on a structured, 
supervised clinical hierarchy that by 
definition are wage levels I or II. 
Another commenter recommended that 
the rule exclude the legal industry, 
stating that big law firms already pay 
high salaries and thus would be unfairly 
advantaged in the weighted lottery. 
Response: DHS declines to adopt special carve outs for certain industries 
or sectors or give additional weighting 
for registrations in ‘‘critical sectors’’ or 
‘‘essential industries.’’ Similarly, DHS 
declines to provide exemptions, 
weighting, or other special treatment for 
small businesses, non-profits, the public 
sector, startups, or other specific 
occupations or fields from the rule. 
While DHS appreciates the challenges 
faced by certain sectors, industries, and 
types or sizes of employers, carving out 
exceptions for some would be highly 
problematic. DHS believes that such an 
approach would be overly complicated, 
unpredictable, and subjective. For 
example, DHS recognizes that there are 
many occupations that can be 
considered ‘‘critical’’ or ‘‘essential’’ now 
but could change in the future. Making 
these types of determinations is not 
feasible for efficiently conducting the 
registration selection process on an 
annual basis. Therefore, DHS declines to 
adopt these commenters’ suggestions. 
k. Recommendations To Weight Other 
‘‘Merit-Based’’ Factors Related to the 
Petitioner 
Comment: Expressing concern that the proposed rule would not achieve its 
goals, multiple commenters 
recommended that DHS consider 
alternatives that incorporate a more 
‘‘merit-based’’ approach that would 
weight multiple factors. Commenters 
provided various suggestions for factors 
that are specific to the petitioning 
employer, such as, but not limited to: 
the petitioner’s industry and whether 
such industry is critical, essential, or 
important to the national interest; 
company type and size; occupational 
and labor-market shortages; industry or 
occupational need; employer demand or 
need for the position; the nature of the 
job duties, including the level of 
complexity or rarity of the job; societal 
impact; employer credibility and 
compliance history; whether the 
petitioner is in a ‘‘high-unemployment 
commuting zones and for occupations 
with plentiful domestic supply’’; the 
employer’s percentage of ‘‘local’’ or U.S. 
workers; or whether the hiring of the 
foreign worker displaces a U.S. worker. 
The commenters generally claimed that 
weighting various factors would make

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260918 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations the lottery process more fair and 
balanced, as the proposed rule’s 
approach of using salary as a proxy for 
skill may be skewed towards certain 
types of employers. 
Response: DHS declines to adopt the commenters’ suggestions. As previously 
discussed, DHS believes that identifying 
and weighing multiple factors is not 
feasible, as such an approach could be 
overly complicated, unpredictable, and 
subjective. Incorporating multiple 
factors would add unnecessary 
complexity into the process and 
frustrate the goal of administering the 
cap selection processing in an efficient 
and effective manner. Further, some of 
these additional factors, such as high 
unemployment commuting zones or 
whether the employer recently 
conducted layoffs, are not feasible for 
efficiently conducting the selection 
process on an annual basis and may 
involve determinations that are beyond 
DHS’s expertise. 
Furthermore, the goal of this 
rulemaking is not to favor employers 
with certain characteristics in the 
allocation of H–1B visas. Rather, the 
goal of this rule is to efficiently and 
effectively implement a weighted 
selection process that would generally 
favor the allocation of H–1B visas to 
higher-skilled and higher-paid aliens. 
l. Recommendations To Weight Other 
‘‘Merit-Based’’ Factors Related to the 
Beneficiary 
Comment: Numerous commenters requested DHS consider various factors 
that are specific to the individual 
beneficiary. These factors include, but 
are not limited to, the beneficiary’s: 
degree field; industry certification; 
entrepreneurial promise; whether the 
beneficiary is a ‘‘founder’’ of a bona fide 
startup or is an owner of the petitioner; 
U.S. work history and professional 
experience; seniority; professional 
tenure; patents, research contributions; 
personal references; commitment to 
professional development; 
demonstrated expertise in critical 
technology or STEM fields; whether the 
beneficiary has completed or are still 
studying under OPT; length of legal 
residence in the United States; IQ; and 
English proficiency. The commenters 
generally claimed that weighing various 
factors would make the lottery process 
more fair and balanced, as the proposed 
rule’s approach of using salary as a 
proxy for skill does not capture all 
indicators of a beneficiary’s value, 
including his or her talent, potential, 
and contributions to an employer. 
Some commenters suggested giving 
higher weight to beneficiaries based on 
the number of prior H–1B registration 
attempts, such that a person in their 
second or third attempt would get a 
higher priority. Another commenter 
made a similar recommendation, but 
added that for candidates that are 
selected but do not apply, their chances 
should be reduced if they enter the 
lottery again. Other commenters 
suggested providing ‘‘last-chance’’ 
priority (e.g., +1 weight or guarantee minimum selection) for students 
transitioning from F–1/OPT to H–1B. 
Another commenter said the rule should 
grandfather current F–1/OPT cohorts 
and phase-in changes, so current 
students are not suddenly trapped. 
Response: DHS declines to adopt the commenters’ suggestions. As previously 
discussed, DHS believes that identifying 
and weighing multiple factors is not 
feasible, as such an approach could be 
overly complicated, unpredictable, and 
subjective. DHS acknowledges that 
salary is a proxy for skill, but maintains 
that this approach is reasonable and 
optimal because it provides ease of 
implementation, predictability, and 
objectivity that would not be found in 
a multi-factor approach, and 
accomplishes the policy goal of 
increasing the chance of selection for 
beneficiaries who will be paid a wage 
that corresponds to a higher wage level. 
Regarding the suggestions to 
specifically consider a beneficiary’s 
prior H–1B registration attempts or time 
left in F–1 status, DHS does not believe 
these factors are relevant to a 
beneficiary’s skill level. As explained in 
the NPRM, the purpose of the weighted 
selection process is to generally favor 
the allocation of H–1B visas to higher- 
skilled and higher-paid aliens. 
Facilitating the admission of higher- 
skilled workers would benefit the U.S. 
economy and increase the United States’ 
competitive edge in attracting the ‘‘best 
and the brightest.’’ 90 FR 45986, 46011 
(Sept. 24, 2025). Giving priority to F–1 
students or beneficiaries solely because 
they have made several unsuccessful 
attempts to obtain an H–1B visa would 
not achieve this purpose. 
Comment: A commenter recommended that USCIS allow 
companies to purchase additional 
chances in the lottery for particular 
candidates, reasoning that this would 
increase the likelihood of selection for 
priority candidates while remaining 
consistent with the lottery system’s 
intent and avoiding wage discrimination 
against U.S. employees. Citing two 
articles, another commenter said that a 
better way is to prioritize workers with 
greater economic value by ‘‘auctioning’’ 
to employers the right to hire a foreign 
worker through the H–1B program. 
Response: DHS declines to allow companies to ‘‘purchase’’ or create an 
‘‘auction’’ as suggested. Similar to 
DHS’s concerns with a selection method 
based purely on the highest salary, DHS 
believes that auctioning registrations to 
the highest bidders would favor large 
corporations with more resources. 
Further, with respect to the concerns 
about wage discrimination against U.S. 
employees, as explained elsewhere, 
DHS does not agree that the rule would 
result in or encourage such 
discrimination. The rule does not 
mandate what wages employers must 
pay their employees and does not 
require employers to artificially raise 
wages. DHS believes businesses are 
unlikely to offer higher wages if the 
employee’s skills do not justify the cost. 
DHS expects that companies will 
continue to make business decisions 
that align with their operational and 
financial interests. 
m. Other Recommendations Regarding 
the Registration Process 
Comment: Commenters suggested that the proposed weighted selection process 
could still be gamed unless DHS 
restricts the maximum number of 
registrations that may be submitted by a 
single company or its affiliated entities. 
Response: While DHS appreciates the concerns the commenters raised, the 
intent of the weighted selection process 
is to generally favor the allocation of H– 
1B visas to higher-skilled and higher- 
paid aliens, while maintaining the 
opportunity for employers to secure H– 
1B workers at all wage levels. It is 
unclear that limiting the maximum 
number of registrations a company or 
related entity may submit in a fiscal 
year would accomplish this goal. 
Further, it would not be possible to 
determine at the registration stage 
whether a registrant is affiliated with or 
related to another registrant, as USCIS 
does not adjudicate the registration. 
Therefore, DHS declines this suggestion. 
Comment: A commenter suggested, without further elaboration, ‘‘integrating 
a beneficiary-centric appeal process’’ for 
workers to report occurrence of wage 
reduction or misrepresentation. 
Response: DHS is unclear what a ‘‘beneficiary-centric appeal process’’ 
means. Regardless, DHS encourages 
individuals to report instances of wage 
reduction or misrepresentation to DOL 
or USCIS, depending on the specific 
facts, through existing channels. DHS 
maintains a tip form where individuals 
can report these and other issues of 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:36 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00056 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\29DER2.SGM 29DER2

www.ice.gov/webform/ice-tip-form. 
compliance and fraud.
91
When 
investigating tips received, USCIS also 
works with Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement and DOL, referring cases as 
needed to those agencies. 
n. Recommendations To Strengthen 
Enforcement Actions 
Comment: Many commenters stated that DHS should strengthen its 
enforcement actions against bad actors 
and fraudulent companies and provided 
alternative anti-fraud measures that 
DHS could pursue instead of broadly 
changing the registration system. Some 
of these commenters stated that targeted 
or more effective enforcement is 
preferable to broadly changing the entire 
registration system which could impact 
bona fide employers and prospective 
beneficiaries. Some commenters 
similarly reasoned that instead of 
adding burdens on all applicants, USCIS 
should focus on tracking, auditing, and 
penalizing the bad actors or fraudulent 
agencies thereby not risking harming the 
entire system when only a minority of 
players are responsible for abuses. The 
commenters’ various anti-fraud 
recommendations included: 
€Increased targeted audits and compliance checks, background checks; 
€Post-approval and post-activation audits to verify that employers follow 
through on wage and job commitments; 
€Run post-selection audits against DOL OEWS and LCA data; 
€Annual compliance reporting to monitor whether wage commitments are 
being honored; 
€Mandatory post-selection wage verification to confirm that promised 
wages are actually paid; 
€Verified reporting of work hours and actual worksite locations to ensure 
compliance with labor conditions; 
€Stricter oversight of remote work arrangements to prevent 
misrepresentation of job locations; 
€Upfront scrutiny of SOC code classifications to reduce manipulation 
of job categories; 
€Increased penalties for fraudulent registrations, violators, and those who 
have misrepresented facts. 
€Closer scrutiny of certain types of companies; and 
€Bans or caps on registrations from firms with patterns of overuse; 
€Bans on outsourcing companies or third-party placements. 
These commenters said that targeted 
enforcement would better protect 
program integrity while preserving 
fairness for bona fide petitioners. 
Response: While DHS agrees with the commenters that stronger measures 
against fraud and abuse of the H–1B 
program are necessary, DHS disagrees 
that the weighted selection process is 
unnecessary. The changes finalized in 
this rule generally favor the allocation of 
H–1B visas to higher-skilled and higher- 
paid aliens, while maintaining the 
opportunity for employers to secure H– 
1B workers at all wage levels, to better 
serve the congressional intent for the H– 
1B program. This rule represents an 
important step the agency is taking 
towards improving the integrity of the 
overall H–1B program. 
With respect to the suggestions to 
increase post-selection verification 
efforts, USCIS officers are trained to 
appropriately scrutinize each petition to 
ensure eligibility during the 
adjudication process, including 
scrutinizing the wage level, SOC code, 
and area of intended employment 
selected on the LCA to determine that 
the LCA properly corresponds to the 
petition, and ensuring that the petition 
includes the same identifying and 
position information. If USCIS were to 
determine that the statement of facts 
contained on the registration or petition 
submission was inaccurate, fraudulent, 
materially misrepresents any fact, or 
was not true and correct, USCIS would 
deny the petition or, if approved, would 
revoke the petition approval. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(ii) and (11)(iii)(A)(2). In 
addition, USCIS would deny (or revoke, 
if approved) an H–1B cap-subject 
petition if it were not based on a valid 
selected registration for the beneficiary 
named or identified in the petition. See 
8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(ii) and (11)(iii)(A)(6). 
Regarding comments about increasing 
upfront scrutiny at the registration stage, 
USCIS does not adjudicate registrations. 
Because registration is not intended to 
replace the petition adjudication 
process or to assess eligibility, USCIS 
cannot feasibly determine at the time of 
registration selection whether a 
registrant has manipulated SOC codes. 
Finally, it is noted that commenters 
provided various other suggestions 
about increasing enforcement or anti- 
fraud activities. Although DHS is 
concerned about preventing fraud and 
abuse in the H–1B program, this rule is 
narrowly focused on governing the 
process by which USCIS selects H–1B 
registrations for unique beneficiaries for 
filing H–1B cap-subject petitions. 
Therefore, DHS considers those 
comments out of scope. However, DHS 
may consider ways to improve the 
integrity of the H–1B program through 
future rulemakings and policy. 
o. Recommendations for Pilot Program 
Comment: Some commenters generally recommended starting with a 
pilot program to assess the proposed 
changes on a smaller scale, rather than 
finalizing the rule as proposed. Other 
commenters recommended that DHS 
proceed with a pilot program, using a 
multi-factor model, including weights 
for occupational shortages, role 
complexity, and employer size, with 
wages normalized to localities and 
published transparently, accompanied 
by a rigorous impact analysis. 
Response: DHS declines to adopt these recommendations and will 
finalize the rule as proposed. As 
previously noted, DHS believes that 
identifying and weighing multiple 
factors is not feasible, as such an 
approach could be overly complicated, 
unpredictable, and subjective. 
p. Recommendations for Staggered 
Filing 
Comment: A commenter who supported the proposed rule 
recommended having staggered filing 
deadlines for petitions by wage levels as 
an alternative in case the proposed rule 
is met with legal challenges. Under this 
alternative, USCIS could have a first 
filing period, where only petitions with 
jobs paying level IV are considered. 
Once all the level IV petitions are 
submitted and approved, then a second 
filing period at a later date could be set 
to receive only petitions with jobs 
paying level III wages. After those are 
collected and approved, if there are any 
visas remaining under the H–1B cap, 
then a filing period for level II wages 
would be next, and finally a filing 
period for level I. This way, all of the 
petitions would not be submitted at 
once, thereby still allowing USCIS to 
adjudicate and allocate petitions ‘‘in the 
order in which’’ they were filed, as the 
statute requires. If there were more 
petitions than available H–1B slots at a 
particular wage level, there could be a 
‘‘mini-lottery’’ within that wage level. 
Another commenter similarly stated that 
the proposed weighted selection scheme 
is lawful but additionally suggested 
amending the proposed process to 
‘‘more closely align with the statute.’’ 
Specifically, the commenter suggested 
that USCIS create different ‘‘application 
windows’’ for each wage level starting 
with wage level IV and proceeding in 
descending order such that when USCIS 
selects a level IV petition it will have 
been received before any petition with 
a lower wage level, consistent with INA 
sec. 214(g)(3). The commenter asserted 
that this process would offer increased

predictability and would better 
withstand legal challenges. 
Response: DHS declines the suggestions to use staggered filing 
deadlines or petition filing windows by 
wage levels. DHS believes these 
suggestions are not necessary because, 
as explained above, this rule is 
consistent with and permissible under 
DHS’s general statutory authority 
provided in INA secs. 103(a), 214(a), 
and (c); 8 U.S.C. 1103(a), 1184(a), and 
(c); and HSA sec. 102, 6 U.S.C. 112. 
2. Effective Date and Implementation 
Comment: Some commenters who supported the rule urged DHS to 
implement the changes immediately 
before the next H–1B registration 
season. 
Response: This rule will be effective in time for the upcoming FY 2027 
registration period, which is set to begin 
in March 2026. 
Comment: Some commenters who disagreed with the proposed rule said 
that, if USCIS were to finalize the 
proposed rule, it should refrain from 
implementing the proposed rule for the 
FY 2027 H–1B registration season 
because changes so late in the year 
would adversely impact U.S. employers, 
immigration lawyers, and individuals. 
The commenters explained that hiring 
decisions and filing processes and 
procedures have already begun based on 
the existing registration system, so 
delaying implementation until after the 
FY 2027 cap filing season would give 
the regulated community time to adapt 
to the new process. A commenter stated 
that a phased-in implementation 
approach would be consistent with 
principles of regulatory fairness and 
would allow stakeholders to adjust 
hiring strategies and educational 
planning accordingly. Likewise, a 
commenter suggested that 
implementation should be delayed until 
at least the FY 2028 H–1B cap filing 
season. The commenter stated that 
USCIS should provide a minimum of six 
months in advance of any H–1B 
registration period, as U.S. employers 
need time to adapt their recruitment 
procedures, hiring process, and filing 
process to the new selection process. 
Another commenter suggested 
withdrawing or delaying the 
implementation of the rule by two years. 
A different commenter suggested 
implementing the weighting gradually, 
with transparent data collection and 
public reporting on effects by wage 
level, employer size, and geographic 
area. A few commenters urged USCIS to 
engage directly with stakeholders before 
finalizing any wage selection rule. 
Response: DHS is not delaying the implementation of this rule. DHS 
believes that this rule is being published 
with sufficient time to allow employers 
to plan appropriately prior to the start 
of the registration period for FY 2027. 
While some petitioners may benefit 
from additional time to adjust to the 
new weighted selection process, DHS 
does not believe that petitioners will 
face significant adverse impacts with 
the implementation of this change in the 
selection process and believes that 
employers have sufficient time to make 
any decisions they believe are needed as 
a result of this rule, such as increasing 
proffered wages to increase the odds of 
selection. In addition, DHS believes that 
it is important to implement the rule as 
soon as possible to prevent further 
adverse impacts on U.S. workers who 
are competing with lower paid H–1B 
workers. 
3. Processing Time Outlook 
Comment: Some commenters remarked that the current system is 
already difficult for people to navigate, 
and the proposed rule would make the 
system more confusing and add 
unnecessary complexity and burden. 
Other commenters similarly noted that 
the proposed weighted selection process 
would be far more complex, resource 
intensive, and lead to adjudication 
delays, inconsistent adjudications, and 
possibly filing errors or erroneous 
rejections. A commenter expressed 
concern that the new, complex weighted 
process would increase the risk of 
technical system errors and unfair 
rejections due to factors outside of the 
petitioner’s control, which could lead to 
delays and add on to what some 
commenters described are already 
lengthy processing times. Some 
commenters stated that increased 
complexity and bureaucracy would lead 
to more costs for the government, 
petitioners, and taxpayers. 
Response: DHS does not agree that the weighted selection process 
implemented through this rule adds 
unnecessary complexity or confusion 
for stakeholders. DHS also does not 
agree that the weighted selection 
process would lead to lengthy 
adjudication or processing times. First, 
DHS notes that USCIS does not 
adjudicate the registration. If 
commenters were referring to the 
petition adjudication process, DHS 
acknowledges there may be some added 
complexity to the adjudication, for 
which DHS will need to train officers, 
and USCIS adjudicators will need 
additional time to review newly 
required information during the 
adjudication of the petition. However, 
DHS does not anticipate any 
unnecessary delays and believes that 
any additional adjudicative burden will 
be outweighed by the overall benefits of 
the weighted selection system. With 
respect to the commenters’ concerns 
about increased costs to the government, 
this rule does not impact current H–1B 
filing or registration fees. In general, 
USCIS reviews the fees for its services 
on a biennial basis. If the review 
determines the current fees are 
inadequate to recover costs, or that they 
otherwise need to be adjusted, then the 
fee schedule adjustment would be 
determined at USCIS’ next 
comprehensive biennial fee review.
92
It 
is unclear what other costs to the 
government the commenters 
contemplated. Regarding the claim that 
this rule would increase costs to 
taxpayers, DHS disagrees and finds 
these comments unclear as to how or 
why this rule would impact taxpayers in 
general as USCIS is primarily a fee- 
funded agency and is not dependent on 
taxpayer dollars.
93
 
With respect to technical errors, 
USCIS is confident that the new system 
and process will be operable in time for 
the FY 2027 registration and cap filing 
season. In the unlikely event that USCIS 
discovers that the new weighted 
selection process is inoperable in time 
for the FY 2027 season, USCIS would 
take remedial measures at that time. 
4. Data and Transparency 
Comment: A commenter recommended publishing the exact 
weighting scheme in advance, including 
any caps, so employers and schools can 
plan accordingly. The commenter 
requested DHS publish ‘‘final technical 
guidance’’ and ‘‘selection outcomes by 
wage level, degree type, employer size, 
North American Industry Classification 
System code, and geography,’’ adding 
that transparency will let DHS validate 
that the system is meeting program goals 
without unintended effects. Another 
commenter requested clear guidance on 
how geographic wage differences will be 
handled. A different commenter 
suggested publishing annual,

anonymized statistics on weighting 
outcomes by wage level, SOC code, and 
metro area to allow labor markets to 
adjust and deter misuse. 
Response: DHS believes that the regulations finalized by this rule 
sufficiently detail the weighted 
selection process for the H–1B cap. As 
described in the NPRM and codified at 
new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(4)(ii) and 
(5)(ii), a beneficiary assigned wage level 
IV will be entered into the selection 
pool four times, a beneficiary assigned 
wage level III will be entered into the 
selection pool three times, a beneficiary 
assigned wage level II will be entered 
into the selection pool two times, and a 
beneficiary assigned wage level I will be 
entered into the selection pool one time. 
It is unclear what ‘‘caps’’ the commenter 
is referring to, as DHS is not 
implementing caps of any particular 
wage level or otherwise altering the 
existing H–1B cap. 
Regarding the request to publish data 
on selection outcomes, DHS notes that 
it is not legally required to publish such 
information. However, DHS already 
makes certain information about H–1B 
beneficiaries public on an annual basis. 
Specifically, pursuant to Section 
416(c)(2) of the American 
Competitiveness and Workforce 
Improvement Act of 1998 (ACWIA),
94
 
DHS submits information on the 
countries of origin and occupations of, 
educational levels attained by, and 
compensation paid to, aliens who were 
issued H–1B visas or otherwise 
provided H–1B nonimmigrant status 
during the previous fiscal year to the 
Committees on the Judiciary of the 
United States House of Representatives 
and the Senate on an annual basis.
95
 
DHS plans to closely monitor the 
impacts of weighting under this 
rulemaking and will consider what 
information, if any, it may be 
appropriate to make publicly available 
beyond what USCIS already provides 
through the annual report to Congress 
and the H–1B Data Hub.
96
 
Comment: A commenter said the need for the proposed weighting approach is 
premature because DHS has not yet 
published a transparent assessment of 
FY 2025–FY 2026 outcomes under the 
beneficiary-centric rule, which was 
designed to reduce gaming and ensure 
each beneficiary has the same chance of 
selection. The commenter further said 
that DHS must first provide evidence 
that ‘‘material integrity gaps persist’’ 
that the beneficiary-centric changes did 
not solve but that wage weighting 
would. Another commenter said that the 
proposed rule does not account for the 
recently implemented H–1B 
Modernization Rule and the beneficiary- 
centric registration system, which have 
significantly strengthened the integrity 
of the H–1B program. 
Response: DHS disagrees with these commenters. Beneficiary-centric 
selection and weighted selection serve 
different, though complementary, policy 
goals. It is therefore appropriate to have 
both beneficiary-centric selection and 
weighted selection. In February 2024, 
DHS amended its regulations to 
implement a beneficiary-centric 
selection process for H–1B registration 
to ensure each beneficiary would have 
the same chance of being selected, 
regardless of the number of registrations 
submitted on his or her behalf, among 
other integrity measures. 89 FR 7456 
(Feb. 2, 2024). The beneficiary-centric 
selection process is needed to prevent 
unscrupulous actors from unfairly 
increasing the odds that a beneficiary 
will be selected, thus it is important to 
keep the beneficiary-centric selection 
process in place. The goal of this rule is 
to implement a selection process that 
builds on the beneficiary-centric 
selection process and favors the 
allocation of H–1B visas to higher- 
skilled and higher-paid workers. Even 
with the weighted selection process, the 
need to prevent unscrupulous actors 
from unfairly increasing the odds of 
selection remains. Therefore, the wage- 
based selection process finalized in this 
rule will operate in conjunction with 
the existing beneficiary-centric selection 
process and there is no reason to delay 
this rule. Similarly, the commenters 
have failed to explain how they believe 
the integrity measures in the final rule 
‘‘Modernizing H–1B Requirements, 
Providing Flexibility in the F–1 
Program, and Program Improvements 
Affecting Other Nonimmigrant 
Workers’’ impact the weighted selection 
process. While the integrity measures in 
that rule have value, they did not 
implement a weighted selection process 
to favor the allocation of H–1B visas to 
higher-skilled and higher-paid aliens. 
The weighted selection process will 
build upon improvements made in prior 
rules, and the commenters provided 
nothing to suggest otherwise. 
5. Comments Related to Presidential 
Proclamation 10973, Restriction on 
Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers 
(September 19, 2025) 
Comment: Some commenters who opposed the rule stated that the impact 
of the proposed rule must be considered 
in combination with the $100,000 fee. 
For instance, commenters noted that 
certain businesses, such as small and 
mid-sized businesses, startups, 
nonprofits, and universities, would 
essentially be priced out of the H–1B 
program. Other commenters remarked 
that the combination of the new fee plus 
the weighted registration would deter 
skilled international students and 
workers from choosing to work and 
study in the United States. A few 
commenters further argued that the fee 
would be cost-prohibitive and thus 
employers in less geographically- 
desirable locations will have even more 
difficulty filling open positions. 
Another commenter noted that the new 
fee along with a new weighted lottery 
system introduces two significant 
procedural changes which will likely 
cause investment uncertainty and risk 
for companies that utilize H–1B visas, 
which will harm U.S. companies and 
not help U.S. workers. 
Response: DHS disagrees with these commenters. In the H–1B Proclamation, 
President Trump noted that the H–1B 
program ‘‘has been deliberately 
exploited to replace, rather than 
supplement, American workers with 
lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.’’ 90 FR 
46027 (Sept. 19, 2025). The President 
concluded that it was, therefore, 
‘‘necessary to impose higher costs on 
companies seeking to use the H–1B 
program in order to address the abuse of 
that program while still permitting 
companies to hire the best of the best 
temporary foreign workers.’’ 90 FR 
46027 (Sept. 19, 2025). The President, in 
the H–1B Proclamation, also directed 
the Secretary of Homeland Security to 
‘‘initiate a rulemaking to prioritize the 
admission as nonimmigrants of high- 
skilled and high-paid aliens.’’ 90 FR 
46027 (Sept. 19, 2025). This rule is 
consistent with the President’s policy 
direction and is an important 
component of the effort to favor the 
allocation of H–1B visas to higher- 
skilled and higher-paid aliens. That is, 
even where the H–1B Proclamation 
applies, this rule is needed to help 
ensure the allocation of H–1B visas to 
higher-skilled and higher-paid aliens, 
while maintaining the opportunity for 
employers to secure H–1B workers at all 
wage levels. 
Further, DHS notes that the $100,000 
payment required by the H–1B 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:36 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\29DER2.SGM 29DER2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260922 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations 97
USCIS, H–1B Specialty Occupations, https://
www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/h-1b- 
specialty-occupations (last modified Oct. 20, 2025). Proclamation does not apply to all H– 
1B petitions. For example, USCIS has 
clarified that the H–1B Proclamation 
‘‘does not apply to a petition filed at or 
after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on 
September 21, 2025, that is requesting 
an amendment, change of status, or 
extension of stay for an alien inside the 
United States where the alien is granted 
such amendment, change, or 
extension.’’
97
In addition, exceptions to 
the $100,000 payment may be granted 
by the Secretary of Homeland Security 
to any individual alien, all aliens 
working for a company, or all aliens 
working in an industry. Finally, the H– 
1B Proclamation will expire, absent 
extension, 12 months from its effective 
date. This rule, in contrast, will 
continue indefinitely. 
For these reasons, DHS believes that 
this rule remains necessary to better 
ensure that initial H–1B visas and status 
grants would more likely go to the 
highest-skilled or highest-paid 
beneficiaries. While DHS recognizes 
that this could result in increased costs 
for a business, and that the combined 
effect of the two policies could further 
disadvantage businesses that lack the 
resources to pay the $100,000 fee and 
higher wages, DHS believes that having 
a greater chance to recruit or retain 
talented employees may offset these 
increased costs. If a company is unable 
to pay an alien a higher wage for a 
greater chance of selection, they could 
alternatively try to find and hire a U.S. 
worker. 
Comment: A few commenters noted the combined impact of the $100,000 fee 
with the proposed rule. A commenter 
stated that the $100,000 fee represents a 
substantial enough surcharge such that 
it already limits H–1B petitions to 
beneficiaries who are ‘‘very valuable to 
the company and America.’’ The 
commenter suggested that DHS should 
first allow more time to measure the 
impact of these recent changes on the 
H–1B program without further 
complicating it with a weighted 
selection process. Another commenter 
said that the new $100,000 fee helps to 
ensure that only genuine and serious H– 
1B filings will be submitted and will 
address issues of registration abuse. 
This commenter concluded that the new 
fee renders a weighted lottery 
‘‘unnecessary and redundant.’’ 
Response: DHS disagrees with these commenters. As previously explained, 
the weighted selection process 
implemented in this rulemaking 
complements the stated goals of the H– 
1B Proclamation, in that it seeks to 
‘‘prioritize the admission as 
nonimmigrants of high-skilled and high- 
paid aliens.’’ 90 FR 46027 (Sept. 19, 
2025). Further, the H–1B Proclamation 
applies to a subset of petitions, whereas 
this rule applies to all cap-subject 
petitions, and the H–1B Proclamation 
has an expiration date, whereas this rule 
does not. DHS therefore believes that 
this rule remains necessary, and that 
there is no need to allow more time for 
the implementation of this final rule. 
G. Statutory and Regulatory 
Requirements 
1. Administrative Procedure Act (APA) 
a. Request for 30-Day Extension 
Comment: Some commenters requested that USCIS extend the 
comment period by 30 days, stating that 
given the complexity and impact of the 
proposed changes the current 30-day 
window is insufficient for meaningful 
public input on a rule of this scope. For 
example, one such commenter cited the 
rule’s economic significance, technical 
detail, and broad impact across sectors, 
and said that a longer period would 
support informed public participation, 
strengthen the administrative record, 
and align with established practices 
under the APA and Executive Order 
12866. 
Commenters stated that E.O.s 12866 
and 13563 recommend a minimum 60- 
day comment period for economically 
significant regulatory actions and wrote 
that DHS’s delay in publishing the rule 
undermines the urgency argument. The 
commenters also said that the 
government shutdown on October 1, 
2025, disrupted normal operations since 
it resulted in the cessation of operations 
of National Archives and Records 
Administration (NARA), which controls 
the Federal Register. The commenters said that although public comments can 
still be submitted during the shutdown, 
NARA noted on the Federal Register 
page that it will not provide any 
technical assistance. The commenter 
did not explain what technical 
assistance they may have required in 
this regard. 
The commenters expressed concern 
over the lack of prior notice about the 
rule and cited past DHS statements and 
court decisions that questioned the 
legality of prioritizing H–1B petitions 
based on wages. Several commenters 
requested more time to conduct 
economic and legal analysis, collect 
data, and to propose viable alternatives, 
asserting that DHS should provide a full 
60-day period to allow employers time 
to analyze the rule, prepare feedback, 
and adjust operations to reduce 
unintended negative impacts. 
Response: While DHS acknowledges that E.O.s 12866 and 13563 indicate that 
agencies generally should provide 60 
days for public comment, DHS believes 
that the 30-day comment period was 
sufficient in this case given: (1) the 
narrow scope of the rulemaking (i.e., 
addressing the selection process, which 
is a discrete aspect of the H–1B 
program), and (2) the history of 
rulemaking on this topic. In addition, 
DHS has a compelling policy interest, as 
well as a rulemaking directive from the 
President to propose a rule that 
prioritizes the admission of high skilled 
and high paid aliens. 90 FR 46027 (Sept. 
19, 2025). Therefore, DHS did not 
extend the comment period. Given the 
narrow scope of this rulemaking, and 
the fact that DHS had previously 
proposed a similar, though not 
identical, concept of wage-based 
selection, DHS believes that 30 days was 
sufficient time for the public to 
determine the impacts of the proposed 
rule and to prepare and submit 
comments. The sufficiency of the 30-day 
comment period is demonstrated by the 
number of high-quality comments 
received from the public, including 
individuals, attorneys, employers, and 
organizations. 
Comment: Some commenters discussed perceived shortcomings of the 
NPRM and urged DHS to reconsider the 
proposal and, as necessary, to publish a 
supplemental NPRM addressing these 
shortcomings and requesting public 
comment. Some commenters discussed 
such perceived shortcomings and 
requested that DHS at a minimum delay 
implementation of the rule until the 
following (FY 2028) cap season. Among 
other issues, commenters stated that the 
proposal to tie selection to wage levels 
could deter employers from filling hard- 
to-fill roles or result in employers 
pushing work offshore, and that DHS 
failed to consider variable compensation 
factors, provide exemptions for roles 
tied to critical infrastructure, or clarify 
ambiguities regarding situations 
involving relocations, multiple office 
locations, SOC code classification 
flexibility, and lottery allocation 
uncertainty. Commenters wrote that 
these issues must be addressed to 
ensure fairness, predictability, and 
transparency in the H–1B process. 
Other commenters advised DHS to 
take into consideration other factors to 
prioritize selection, such as age, tenure, 
performance, and long-term 
contribution potential and issue an 
updated proposal or not implement 
changes until the FY 2028 cap season, 
particularly ‘‘[g]iven that many

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260923 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations international workers cannot even 
access their official wage level data 
during this public comment period, 
proceeding now would be premature.’’ 
Response: DHS declines to delay the implementation of this final rule until 
the FY 2028 cap season. DHS has 
addressed proposed alternatives to the 
wage selection methodology elsewhere 
in this rule but believes that the 
weighted methodology strikes a balance 
between addressing policy goals of 
selecting higher-paid and higher-skilled 
beneficiaries in a fair manner and 
creating a methodology that is 
administrable in the context of the H– 
1B registration process, as well as the 
H–1B petition process, in the event the 
registration process is ever suspended. 
With respect to commenters who said 
they could not access wage-level data 
during the comment period, it is unclear 
what they were referencing. However, 
DHS does not believe that a temporary 
inability to access wage-level data 
prevents the commenters from 
understanding the weighted selection 
methodology included in this rule. DHS 
also notes that wage-level data changes 
from year to year based on adjustments 
to the OEWS. As discussed elsewhere in 
this rule, DHS believes that it has 
compelling reasons to move 
expeditiously to implement the wage- 
level-based selection for the upcoming 
FY 2027 cap season. 
2. Regulatory Impact Analysis and 
Benefits (E.O.s 12866 and 13563) 
Comment: A commenter stated that the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) 
failed to fully address the impacts of the 
proposed selection process on the 
broader economy. The commenter cited 
DHS analysis that showed that 76 
percent of H–1B petitioners are small 
business owners, and that the proposed 
regulation would impose significant 
financial burdens on a substantial 
number of small entities, with many 
facing cost increases greater than 1–5 
percent of their revenue. However, the 
commenter claimed that DHS failed to 
address the fact that small businesses 
are the primary drivers of job creation 
and innovation in the United States. 
The commenter further claimed that 
imposing heavy costs or pricing small 
businesses out of the global talent 
market undermines national interests by 
impeding their ability to hire and 
innovate. The commenter concluded 
that, ultimately, these burdens could 
lead to higher costs or reduced services 
for American communities. 
An industry group commented that 
using LCA wage data as a proxy for 
registration wage data leaves 
considerable ambiguity on the projected 
impact of the rule, because the LCA is 
not currently required to be submitted at 
registration. The commenter encouraged 
USCIS to conduct a comprehensive 
impact assessment that quantifies 
potential effects on critical industries. 
One commenter said that DHS has not 
‘‘adequately quantified and considered 
the distortions of this proposal, 
including potential disparate impacts on 
the economies of different geographic 
areas.’’ A commenter highlighted the 
need for DHS to estimate the number of 
affected small entities, detail 
compliance burdens, consider 
significant alternatives, and therefore 
reopen comments to allow meaningful 
input from small businesses. 
A commenter said that DHS failed to 
adequately address the negative impacts 
on particular employers, such as those 
in critical infrastructure sectors. The 
commenter further stated that DHS 
acknowledged a significant reduction in 
H–1B selections for civil engineers and 
architects yet failed to provide a 
comprehensive economic assessment of 
the resulting labor shortages. 
Response: DHS acknowledges the importance of small businesses to the 
U.S. economy and that the rule may 
have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities. 
DHS notes that these impacts primarily 
reflect distributional outcomes inherent 
in administering a fixed statutory cap, 
rather than new compliance costs 
created by the rule. Establishing 
different standards or preferential 
treatment for small businesses would be 
inconsistent with the policy objective of 
facilitating the admission of higher- 
skilled alien workers for employers and 
would undermine fairness and program 
integrity. Prioritizing registrations by 
higher wage level equivalencies aligns 
with the policy objective to allocate 
limited H–1B visas to positions that 
reflect higher skill and pay and supports 
innovation and competitiveness by 
increasing the chance of selection for 
higher-paid, higher-skilled beneficiaries. 
DHS recognizes that an LCA is not 
required at registration and, therefore, 
DHS does not have data on the number 
of registrations by wage level. For 
analytical purposes, DHS assumes that 
the distribution of wage levels observed 
in cap-subject petitions (from LCA data) 
reasonably approximates the 
distribution of wage levels in 
registrations. To the extent proffered 
wages exceed the wage levels indicated 
on the LCA, the projections presented 
here should be viewed as an upper 
bound of the rule’s impact. Because 
DHS cannot estimate how many 
registrants would select a higher wage 
level than required on the LCA, DHS 
uses LCA wage data as a reasonable 
proxy for registration wage data. DHS 
did not receive any alternative data 
sources from commenters that would 
allow for a more reasonable proxy for 
registration data or that could 
appropriately substitute for the petition 
data used in the analysis. 
LCA wage data are based on the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics’ OEWS wage 
survey which is derived from employer 
compensation data and produces 
estimates by occupation and geographic 
area, reflecting national patterns and 
regional labor-market conditions. The 
LCA wage levels are adjusted to 
correspond to progressively higher 
degrees of skill, experience, and 
responsibility within an occupation, 
and using them in the selection process 
helps normalize comparisons across 
local labor markets. 
DHS declines to establish carve-outs 
for particular employers or occupations, 
and such carve-outs would be 
impractical within the H–1B framework. 
Accordingly, DHS applied a consistent 
allocation method while ensuring that 
all employers—including small entities 
and those in essential occupations— 
retain meaningful opportunities for 
selection under the same criteria. 
In the Initial Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis (IRFA) accompanying the 
NPRM, DHS carefully addressed the 
number of affected small entities and 
the estimation methods, the principal 
North American Industry Classification 
System (NAICS) sectors among filers, 
wage-level distributions by entity size, 
the direct economic impacts and counts 
of impacted entities, projected 
reporting, recordkeeping, and other 
compliance requirements, and the 
significant alternatives considered. 
Accordingly, DHS has determined that 
reopening the comment period is not 
warranted to obtain additional 
meaningful input from small entities. 
DHS declines to include an economic 
assessment on separate occupation- 
specific labor shortages. The new 
weighted selection process is not 
designed to project occupational 
demand, nor does DHS seek to set 
occupation-specific priorities, 
guarantees, or reserved allocations. The 
H–1B program is a general specialty 
occupation visa category, not a targeted 
labor shortage program. The weighted 
selection process applies uniformly and 
neutrally across all SOC codes and 
industries. DHS’s goal is to fairly and 
efficiently administer the H–1B cap 
selection process whenever registrations 
(or petitions, as applicable) exceed the 
annual numerical limitations. It is not

selected each year. 
DHS appreciates the commenter’s 
concerns regarding the potential broader 
economic impacts of the proposed 
selection process, particularly on small 
businesses and their role in job creation 
and innovation. However, the RFA does 
not require agencies to assess indirect or 
secondary effects, such as broader 
economic impacts or downstream 
consequences on the economy as a 
whole. The IRFA and Final Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) prepared for 
this rule focus on the direct economic 
impacts on small entities that are 
subject to the proposed selection 
process. While DHS recognizes the 
importance of small businesses to the 
U.S. economy and innovation, the 
broader economic considerations raised 
by the commenter are not part of the 
RFA’s requirements. 
3. Methodology and Adequacy of the 
Cost-Benefit Analysis 
Some commenters stated that the cost- 
benefit analysis conducted by DHS is 
flawed. Specific issues that were raised 
are addressed below. 
a. Quantifying the Impacts 
Comment: A commenter stated that given the availability of multi-year DHS 
data on registrations, selections, and 
petition approvals, the cost-benefit 
analysis should have simulated how the 
proposed weighted selection process 
would affect selections by wage level, 
employer size, occupation, and 
geography, as well as to estimate 
expected changes in labor market 
outcomes. Without such quantitative 
analysis, the regulatory impact analysis 
is incomplete. 
Response: DHS disagrees with this comment. The RIA quantified expected 
impacts by wage level using DOL LCA 
data, which is the best available dataset 
aligned with the rule’s use of LCA wage 
levels. Because the LCA process 
generally relies on OEWS prevailing 
wages that are specific to occupation 
and geographic area, the wage-level 
analysis inherently reflects occupational 
and regional labor market differences. 
The IRFA accompanying the NPRM also 
addressed employer size, including the 
number of affected small entities, the 
principal NAICS sectors among 
petitioners, and wage-level distributions 
by entity size. Accordingly, the RIA 
provided rigorous quantification where 
data permitted and qualitative 
assessment where measurement 
constraints exist. 
Comment: A commenter stated that the NPRM did not adequately model or 
quantify the broader economic costs of 
reducing access to high-skilled foreign 
talent. The commenter argued that wage 
level is not the same as skill, and the 
NPRM does not convincingly show that 
the new process will actually raise skill 
or pay levels. 
Response: DHS disagrees with these comments. The rule does not alter the 
eligibility criteria, numerical cap limits, 
or availability of H–1B visas, nor does 
it affect the availability of foreign 
students’ enrollment and post 
completion OPT. Accordingly, DHS 
does not expect direct effects on the 
foreign talent pipeline. DHS believes 
that wages reflect market valuation of 
skills and productivity. OEWS wage 
levels, derived from employer 
compensation data, provide occupation- 
and geography-specific estimates that 
capture national and regional conditions 
and the higher wage levels are a 
reasonable proxy for progressively 
higher skill. 
DHS also disagrees with the comment 
that the NPRM does not convincingly 
show that the new process will actually 
raise skill or pay levels. As shown in 
Table 12 of the NPRM, over a five-year 
period, the wage-level distribution of 
cap-subject petition receipts was 
approximately 28 percent (level I), 55 
percent (level II), 12% (level III), and 
5% (level IV). Because receipts are 
concentrated in levels I and II, a purely 
random selection would mirror that 
distribution. The rule’s shift from 
random to weighted selection is 
intended to encourage employers to 
offer higher wages to higher-skilled H– 
1B workers to increase their chance of 
selection and to reduce incentives to use 
the program for relatively lower-paid, 
lower-skilled workers. As discussed in 
the RIA, moving to a weighted selection 
process is expected to increase the 
number and share of selected 
registrations with wages that correspond 
to a level IV, resulting in higher average 
offered wages among selected H–1B cap- 
subject workers. 
b. Calculation Error 
Comment: A commenter identified what he or she characterized as a 
calculation error in DHS’s analysis that 
led the agency to understate the 
negative impact on workers at level I 
and overstate the benefits for those at 
levels III and IV. After correcting the 
error, the commenter found that 
individuals at level I would receive 
11,518 fewer H–1B selections, more 
than DHS’s estimate, while those at 
level IV would receive 4,426 more 
selections, and level III and II would 
also see increased selections. Another 
commenter raised the same issue, 
stating that there were calculation errors 
in the NPRM’s tables (specifically Table 
13), where the method for estimating the 
number of petitions by wage level is 
unclear or incorrect. The commenter 
claimed that this issue affected 
subsequent estimates of how the rule 
would change the distribution of 
petitions by wage level. 
Response: DHS clarifies that the final line in Table 13 is not an error; it is the 
simulation result rather than the 
product of the number of petitions and 
the suggested weighted probability. In 
this final rule, further explanation is 
added in the notes to Table 13, 
explaining why DHS presented 
simulation results rather than using a 
weighted probability. Since unique 
beneficiaries can be selected only once, 
the selection process is conducted 
without replacement. However, 
multiplying the number of petitions by 
the selection probability assumes a 
with-replacement lottery (e.g., for a wage level IV registrant, four entries are 
placed into the lottery. If one of the 
beneficiary’s registrations is selected, 
the remaining three registrations for that 
beneficiary would still have an equal 
chance of selection. However, under the 
USCIS selection process, the remaining 
three registrations would be removed 
once the first registration was selected). 
In practice, selections are made without 
replacement, so this calculation 
overstates the number of selected 
beneficiaries and the estimated impact 
under the proposed rule. Also, 
calculating the weighted probability 
without replacement is intractable to 
compute explicitly, so DHS used a 
Monte Carlo simulation method to 
estimate line F in Table 13. 
Comment: A commenter said the NPRM relies on petitions (winners) 
rather than registrations (all 
submissions) and fails to align its 
analysis with the ‘‘unique beneficiary’’ 
selection process. The commenter wrote 
that DHS’s calculations in the NPRM 
were based on FY 2020–FY 2024 
lotteries among registrations instead of 
unique beneficiaries, even though 
USCIS shifted to beneficiary-centric 
selection for the FY 2025 cap season. 
The commenter also wrote that the 
NPRM incorrectly stated that 
implementation occurred in FY 2024, 
which creates confusion, and the 
analysis should be conducted under the 
current unique beneficiary process. 
Moreover, the commenter stated that 
DHS presumably has the information 
necessary to merge registrations with 
LCA data, but the NPRM did not merge 
registrations with LCAs to obtain wage 
levels for all submissions, and relying 
only on petition winners may bias

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260925 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations estimates and overstate shifts to higher 
wage levels under weighting. 
Response: To clarify the timeline, the beneficiary-centric process applied to 
the FY 2025 cap season, and the 
operational work for that season 
occurred during FY 2024. Stating that 
the beneficiary-centric process was 
implemented in FY 2024 refers to when 
USCIS operationalized the change, not 
the cap year label. The timing does not 
affect the analytical framework, and an 
explanatory note was included in Table 
3 in the NPRM. 
Contrary to the commenter’s 
assumption, DHS does not have the 
information necessary to merge 
registrations with LCA data. LCAs are 
not required for registrations. 
Registrations currently do not include 
verified wage level information. Wage 
levels are verified at the petition stage 
via the associated LCA. Also, not every 
registration can be cleanly merged with 
an LCA by employer and position, and 
a substantial share of registrations never 
mature into petitions. For those reasons, 
wage distributions derived by merging 
registrations and LCAs by employer and 
position would be noisy and potentially 
misleading. DHS acknowledges the 
limitation of using petition data to 
estimate the impact at the registration 
stage; however, using petition data 
ensures wage levels are validated and 
provides a reliable basis for analysis. 
The beneficiary-centric change 
reduced the issue of duplicate 
registrations for the same individual and 
substantially reduced any potential 
divergence between petition 
distributions and registration-level wage 
mixes for multi-registration 
beneficiaries. This effort has anchored 
the registration process to real 
registration entries rather than 
speculative ones. For the remaining 
small number of multi-registration 
beneficiaries, assigning the lowest wage 
level across multiple registrations as 
proposed and finalized in this rule 
prevents gaming and creates a 
consistent beneficiary-level input for 
weighting. Because the lowest wage 
level will govern selection probability at 
the registration stage under the new rule 
when multiple registrations are 
submitted for the same beneficiary or 
the beneficiary will work in multiple 
locations, unique beneficiaries have less 
incentive to choose to have multiple 
registrations submitted on their behalf at 
different wage levels. Therefore, DHS’s 
use of petition data to estimate the 
wage-level distribution of the 
registration population is expected to 
reasonably reflect the wage-level 
distribution that will occur under the 
new rule. 
Comment: A commenter stated that DHS calculations combined both the 
regular cap (65,000 visas) and the 
advanced degree exception pool (20,000 
visas). However, the distribution of 
beneficiaries across wage levels is 
different for these two groups. 
Specifically, a much higher proportion 
of advanced degree beneficiaries are at 
wage level I (36 percent) compared to 
other beneficiaries (20 percent). Because 
advanced degree holders get two 
chances in the lottery (first in the 
advanced degree pool, then in the 
regular pool if not selected), they are 
more likely to be chosen. Without 
accounting for this, DHS calculations 
overstated how much the new weighted 
selection process would reduce the 
share of low-wage (level I) petitions. 
Response: Since the wage level distribution of advanced degree 
registrants is slightly different from that 
of regular cap registrants and advanced 
degree registrants have slightly higher 
concentration in wage level I compared 
to regular cap registrants, DHS 
recognizes combining the pool of 
beneficiaries for the regular cap and the 
advanced degree exemption would 
result in a decrease in wage level I 
beneficiaries under the rule. However, 
modeling the proposed weighted 
selection as a single pooled draw across 
all registrations is more tractable and 
clarifies the rule’s impact with minor 
loss of accuracy. 
Despite the difference, the wage level 
distribution of advanced degree 
registrants and regular cap registrants is 
similar between groups: concentrations 
at wage level I and II are heavy, while 
wage level III and IV are lighter. The 
difference between the two-step and 
pooled model is small because only 
20,000 out of 85,000 cap slots go 
towards the advanced degree 
exemption, and the wage-level mix of 
advanced degree filings is broadly 
similar to that of the total pool. See 
Table 12 of the NPRM and the analysis 
in this final rule. As a result, DHS 
expects the two-step selection process 
model would affect the overall wage- 
level share by only a small amount, 
while the weighting itself changes 
selection rates by much larger margins. 
The analysis provided aims to help 
readers better understand how the rule 
may modify the selection process, while 
recognizing that it cannot precisely 
capture all potential impacts. 
Comment: A commenter questioned the accuracy of Figures 2 and 3 in the 
NPRM, noting they show civil 
engineers, statisticians, and architects 
(except landscape and naval) with no or 
virtually no petitions above wage level 
I, and ‘‘Computer Occupations, All 
Other’’ with no petitions at wage level 
I, despite other data indicating 
otherwise. The commenter noted that 
USCIS data on H–1B petitions obtained 
by Bloomberg merged with the DOL 
LCA data indicate that in FYs 2021– 
2024, over 5 percent of petitions with 
the SOC title ‘‘Computer Occupations, 
All Other’’ were at wage level I. The 
commenter stated that this is 
inconsistent with the claim in the notice 
that there were no petitions in that 
occupation at wage level I during fiscal 
years 2020–2024. The commenter also 
objected to the NPRM’s claim that 
‘‘Electronics Engineers, Except 
Computer,’’ ‘‘Materials Engineers,’’ and 
‘‘Engineers, All Other’’ would have no 
petitions at wage level I under the 
proposed weighting, citing evidence 
that these occupations have had non- 
trivial wage level I shares under the 
current process. The commenter added 
that the USCIS data on H–1B petitions 
obtained by Bloomberg merged with the 
DOL LCA data indicate that in fiscal 
years 2021–2024 almost 20 percent of 
petitions with the SOC title ‘‘Electronics 
Engineers, Except Computer’’ were at 
wage level I, over 12 percent of petitions 
with the SOC title ‘‘Materials 
Engineers’’ were at wage level I, and 
almost 45 percent of petitions with the 
SOC title ‘‘Engineers, All Other’’ were at 
wage level I. The commenter stated that 
it is unclear why DHS asserted in the 
NPRM that these occupations ‘‘are not 
expected to contain any wage level I 
registrations’’ under the proposed rule. 
Response: Figures 2 and 3 show only the top five SOC 6-digit occupations 
within SOC major group 15 (Computer 
and Mathematical Occupations) and 
SOC major group 17 (Architecture and 
Engineering Occupations). DHS 
presented only the top five because they 
cover more than 70 percent of the 
distribution and are intended to 
illustrate that DHS projected 
distributional changes in occupations 
due to the rule. Both figures have titles 
that indicate these are the top five SOC 
6-digit codes. The figures illustrate the 
distributional impacts across SOC codes 
and should not be interpreted as 
indicating that no petitions exist for 
occupations or wage levels not shown. 
Figure 2 shows, for each wage level, the 
top five six-digit SOC codes within the 
Computer and Mathematical 
Occupations category. SOC 15–1299 
does not appear in the top five at wage 
level I, but it does at wage levels II, III, 
or IV. The NPRM misstated that there 
were no petitions at certain wage levels 
within specific SOC codes. Such 
petitions did exist but for those wage 
levels, the relevant SOC codes did not

The commenter referenced ‘‘partial weighting’’ 
whereby minimally acceptable weights might apply 
to only a portion of locations or occupations to 
correct for differences within specific subgroups, 
whereas ‘‘steep weighting’’ refers to assigning 
relatively larger weights to correct for overall 
differences. 
have enough petitions to appear among 
the top five SOC codes presented in the 
figures. This has been clarified in the 
final rule. It did not affect the 
underlying analysis or conclusions. 
c. Distributional Effects and Transfers 
Comment: A commenter stated that the distributional effects and transfers 
associated with the proposed process 
were not appropriately analyzed. The 
commenter wrote that the proposed 
weighting favors higher-wage firms and 
certain regions or occupations with high 
prevailing wages, while disadvantaging 
small, resource-constrained employers 
and lower-wage areas. Additionally, if 
weighting results in higher offered 
wages, it constitutes a transfer from 
employers to workers, which the 
commenter said should be described 
and, where possible, quantified across 
different firm sizes and geographic 
locations. Another commenter further 
claimed that DHS failed to monetize the 
economic impact of employers 
offshoring jobs due to reduced access to 
entry-level H–1B workers, as well as the 
loss of revenue from declining foreign 
student enrollment at U.S. institutions. 
The commenter wrote that these transfer 
costs, money and economic activity 
moving abroad should have been 
quantified and balanced against any 
supposed benefits of the rule. The 
commenters concluded that because 
DHS omitted this analysis, its cost- 
benefit assessment is incomplete and 
procedurally flawed, undermining the 
justification for the proposed rule. 
Response: DHS disagrees that distributional effects and transfers were 
not appropriately analyzed. The 
regulatory impact analysis quantifies 
transfers and evaluates distributional 
effects across SOC codes, and the IRFA 
presents impacts by firm size. With 
respect to geography, wage weighting 
uses prevailing wages by occupation 
and area of intended employment, 
which normalizes for local labor 
markets and mitigates any systematic 
advantage for higher-cost regions. 
DHS disagrees that the economic 
impact of employers potentially 
offshoring jobs and the loss of revenue 
from potentially declining foreign 
student enrollment at U.S. institutions 
are transfers that an economic analysis 
for this rule is able to isolate and 
monetize. Decisions to offshore work or 
changes in foreign student enrollment 
are influenced by numerous factors 
beyond this rule. DHS is unable to 
isolate the factors contributing to any 
potential future decline in foreign 
student enrollment from the impacts of 
this rule. The commenter did not 
provide data to support the assertion 
that this rule would result in a decline 
in foreign student enrollment. 
DHS is currently unable to effectively 
model the economic impact of 
employers potentially offshoring jobs, as 
there is no reliable publicly available 
data on how many specific jobs are 
currently offshored due to unsuccessful 
H–1B petitions or how that number 
might change as a result of this rule. 
Additionally, the commenter did not 
provide any data or a methodology to 
quantify the economic impact of one 
company offshoring a job due to not 
receiving an H–1B petition in the lottery 
versus another company retaining a 
position in the U.S. after successfully 
obtaining a petition. While DHS 
acknowledges that this may be a 
business decision some companies are 
already making, DHS is unable to 
determine how the changes in the 
weighted selection process under this 
rule might influence these decisions in 
the future. 
d. Assessment of Alternatives 
Comment: Some commenters stated that the cost-benefit analysis did not 
compare the proposed weighted 
selection process to reasonable 
alternatives, such as maintaining a 
purely random selection, adjusting 
weighting by region or occupation, or 
reserving selections for small entities. 
Commenters stated that DHS could have 
analyzed, for instance, a beneficiary- 
centric random selection with enhanced 
anti-fraud measures, partial weighting 
(e.g., with limited multipliers) versus steep weighting (increasing weighting 
for higher wage levels), geographic or 
occupation-adjusted weighting to avoid 
penalizing low-cost areas, and 
safeguards for small entities, such as 
floors or set-asides. 
Response: In the NPRM DHS considered reasonable alternatives but 
determined that they do not sufficiently 
meet the rule’s policy objective of 
facilitating the admission of higher 
skilled, higher paid beneficiaries, or 
would undermine program integrity and 
administrability. DHS also carefully 
reviewed and considered a number of 
alternatives suggested by commenters 
and addressed them in detail in the 
Alternatives Considered section of the 
economic analysis portion of this 
preamble. Regarding the alternatives 
proposed by the commenter, DHS 
provides the following responses. 
Retaining a purely random selection 
process (with or without anti-fraud 
measures) does not advance the policy 
objective and leaves incentives for mass 
registration at lower wage levels. Anti- 
fraud tools are complementary and not 
substitutes for an allocation mechanism. 
Partial vs steep weighting does not meet 
the objectives of the rule because partial 
weighting produces only modest 
adjustments that leave selection 
outcomes largely unchanged from the 
current selection process, and steep 
weighting would function more akin to 
a carve-out for wage levels III and IV 
wages while crowding out wage levels 
I and II even more aggressively.
98
 
Geographic or occupation adjusted 
weighting is moot because the weighted 
selection process already normalizes by 
local labor market via prevailing wage 
levels for the occupation and area of 
intended employment. Adding explicit 
regional or occupation carve-outs would 
be complex, subjective, and more 
susceptible to gaming. Any alternative 
process that provides a different, 
preferential weighting scheme 
especially for small entities would 
undermine the overall utility of this 
rule, which is to generally favor the 
allocation of H–1B visas to higher- 
skilled and higher-paid aliens. 
e. Costs to Employers 
Comment: A commenter stated that the analysis failed to fully account for 
the significant costs to employers. 
According to the commenter, while DHS 
acknowledged that the new weighted 
selection process would sharply reduce 
the chances of selecting registrations or 
petitions for entry-level positions, it did 
not adequately analyze the broader 
economic consequences for employers. 
Specifically, the agency overlooked the 
increased liability risks associated with 
artificially raising wage rates for H–1B 
workers, which could expose employers 
to claims of wage discrimination under 
Federal law if domestic workers are not 
similarly compensated. To avoid such 
litigation, employers may be forced to 
raise wages for all entry-level 
employees, resulting in substantial, 
unaddressed costs, especially for small 
businesses operating on fixed contracts 
and narrow margins. The commenter 
wrote that DHS’s analysis only 
considered transfer costs to H–1B 
workers and failed to provide a 
comprehensive cost analysis of these 
broader impacts, despite acknowledging 
its ability to do so. This omission is a 
fundamental flaw, as many small 
employers may be unable to absorb 
these costs, jeopardizing their ability to 
hire skilled workers and fulfill existing 
contracts.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260927 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations Response: DHS assesses the primary economic effect as distributional 
transfers among petitioners due to a 
reallocation of selections from wage 
level I to higher wage levels within a 
fixed cap. This leads to an unquantified 
cost in terms of lost producer surplus 
for employers who registered at wage 
level I and were not selected, and a 
corresponding benefit in producer 
surplus for employers at higher wage 
levels whose registrations have higher 
selection probabilities. The rule does 
not require employers to artificially 
raise wages nor does it encourage wage 
discrimination. Businesses are unlikely 
to offer higher wages if the employee’s 
skills do not justify the cost. DHS 
expects that companies will continue to 
make business decisions that align with 
their operational and financial interests. 
The weighted selection process does 
not mandate any specific wage level; 
employers remain legally obligated to 
pay H–1B workers at least the prevailing 
wage or the actual wage, whichever is 
higher. See INA sec. 212(n)(1), 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(1). Differentiated wages are 
already required under existing law, if 
necessary to comply with the prevailing 
wage obligation, and this rule does not 
change those existing obligations or 
create additional wage liabilities. 
f. Other Comments 
Comment: A commenter stated that the economic analysis underpinning the 
proposed rule overly relies on outdated 
studies and does not account with 
sufficient care for USCIS’ own recent 
statistics. The commenter pointed to 
Figure 1 in the proposed rule and said 
that it clearly shows the vast majority of 
H–1B petitions for positions within the 
most relevant SOC codes are filed at 
wage level I and II, with the 
overwhelming majority of computer and 
mathematical occupations filed at level 
II. The commenter added that 
presenting the wage level selection 
effect proposed by DHS by looking only 
at the two-digit SOC code, which breaks 
occupations down only into broad 
‘‘major groups,’’ is itself misleading 
because wage levels are provided for H– 
1B by the DOL based on six-digit SOC 
codes, which breaks the classification 
down much further into detailed, 
specific jobs. The commenter concluded 
that the wage level construct does not 
allow for effective comparison or 
ordering among specific, detailed 
occupations. 
Response: DHS disagrees with the comment. The RIA uses the most 
current H–1B registration and petition 
data available and presents wage- 
distribution information at both the two- 
digit SOC ‘‘major group’’ level and the 
six-digit detailed SOC level. Figure 1 in 
the RIA provides a program-wide 
overview of wage distributions across 
major occupational groups to orient 
readers to broad patterns, while Figures 
2 and 3 supply the more granular six- 
digit SOC analysis that the commenter 
claims is missing. 
Comment: A commenter asserted that the weighted selection process does not 
sufficiently reduce the number of level 
I workers selected. The commenter 
showed self-selected examples of wage 
level distribution of which level I 
registrations still have a big share and 
concluded DHS’s new system is flawed. 
The commenter proposed much more 
aggressive weighing (up to sixteen times 
for level IV) to shift selections toward 
level III and IV. The commenter also 
recommended visa reservations for 
specific occupations, restrictions on 
remote H–1B work, removal of the 
master’s cap exemption, and 
prioritization based on university 
rankings. 
Response: DHS disagrees with the comment that the rule is ‘‘flawed’’ based 
on the commenter’s illustrative tables. 
The commenter picked an example 
where level I registrations are extremely 
dominant so even with weighting, the 
percentage of selected level I 
registrations is extremely high such that 
the commenter concludes that DHS’s 
system is flawed since it could not 
redistribute the selected outcome using 
the proposed weighting. The weighted 
selection process does not guarantee 
that level I registrations will be 
eliminated or reduced to some specific 
target number but rather increases 
relative selection probabilities by 
corresponding wage level. If level I 
registrations massively outnumber 
registrations at higher wage levels, level 
I registrations would still get a 
substantial selected share. DHS declines 
to use much more aggressive weighting. 
DHS believes that the extremely steep 
weighting ratios would create 
disproportionate selection distribution, 
including the exclusion of workers at 
levels I and II. DHS does not intend to 
exclude level I and II workers from 
participation in H–1B program. Also, 
DHS must ensure that the weighted 
selection process remains administrable, 
predictable, and transparent. Extreme 
weighting would greatly exacerbate 
year-to-year variation in selection 
outcomes, which create instability and 
uncertainty for employers. The 
commenter mentioned occupation 
specific visa reservations, limitations on 
remote work, and elimination of the 
congressionally mandated master’s cap 
exemption, but these fall outside of the 
scope of the rule. DHS also declines to 
adopt the commenter’s recommendation 
to prioritize registrations based on 
university’s ranking because specialty 
occupation is not based on the prestige 
or ranking of the academic institution. 
Comment: A commenter, citing several studies, wrote that the proposed 
rule ignores evidence showing that H– 
1B workers earn more than their U.S. 
counterparts. Meanwhile, the 
commenter claimed that the studies 
cited in the proposed rule fail to adjust 
for observable characteristics, such as 
age and experience when comparing 
U.S. and foreign workers and do not 
provide support for the wage-level 
weighting framework. The commenter 
reasoned that because the proposed rule 
aims to increase average salaries of H– 
1B workers and given that the average 
H–1B worker already makes more than 
similar U.S. workers, it is significant 
that the rule fails to show the need to 
prioritize senior workers. Like other 
comments, the commenter also stated 
that wage level may not reflect skill and 
does not allow for cross-occupational 
comparisons. Finally, the commenter 
reasoned that a selection process based 
only on wage levels may shift wage 
distribution leftward as upper wage 
level, low wage occupations dominate 
the selection process. 
Response: DHS acknowledges that it is important to control for observable 
characteristics when comparing wages 
of H–1B workers and U.S. workers. 
However, DHS relies on OEWS wage 
levels reported in LCA filings for H–1B 
positions, which show that most 
petitions are submitted at wage levels I 
and II. Because OEWS wage levels are 
structured so that wage level III 
represents the median wage for an 
occupation and geographic area, the 
concentration of fillings at level I and II 
indicate that H–1B positions are 
generally offered below the local 
median wage. The rule is intended to 
increase the likelihood that petitions 
offering wages at level III and IV will be 
filed. As shown in Table 12, the wage- 
level distribution of cap-subject petition 
receipts is approximately 28% (level I), 
55% (level II), 12% (level III), and 5% 
(level IV). Because receipts are 
concentrated in lower levels I and II, a 
purely random selection would mirror 
that distribution. The rule’s shift from 
random to weighted selection is 
intended to encourage petitioners to 
offer wages that reflect higher-skilled 
specialty occupation positions, and to 
reduce incentives to rely on the program 
for relatively lower-paid, lower-skilled 
positions to displace U.S. workers. As 
discussed in the RIA, moving to a 
weighted selection process is expected 
to increase the number and share of

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260928 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations level IV wage selections, resulting in 
higher average offered wages among 
selected H–1B cap-subject workers. 
4. Costs 
a. Impacts on the Economy, Employers/ 
Registrants/Petitioners, Legal Services 
Providers/HR Specialists 
Comment: A commenter indicated that the NPRM’s estimate of $1.6 billion 
in ‘‘gains’’ from higher H–1B wages is 
‘‘illusory,’’ as this number ignores the 
costs to U.S. workers who have lost jobs 
or promotion opportunities to H–1B 
workers, including ‘‘family costs and 
billions in suppressed labor that stifles 
necessary upskilling.’’ 
Response: DHS disagrees that the NPRM’s estimated $1.6 billion in wage 
gains is illusory. The estimate reflects 
the material change in wages that arises 
when H–1B cap-subject visas are more 
likely to be allocated to higher-paid, 
higher-skilled H–1B workers under the 
weighted selection process. DHS 
quantified the change in the number of 
affected cap-subject workers relative to 
the baseline and the average wage 
differential between higher-wage and 
lower-wage offers and multiplied these 
values to produce the economic impact. 
This is the direct impact of the change 
in the H–1B cap selection process. The 
commenter’s references to family costs 
are outside the scope of the wage gain 
estimate, although DHS agrees that the 
rule may not have captured all the 
effects of the H–1B program at large on 
U.S. workers and their families. 
Comment: One commenter noted that the rule would increase administrative 
burdens, likely in excess of the $15 
million annually that USCIS estimated 
at the registration stage. Another 
commenter said that requiring detailed 
documentation of wage levels and SOC 
codes across multiple worksites would 
impose new administrative burdens on 
employers, particularly smaller 
employers. 
Response: The commenter provides no empirical support for the assertion 
that annual burden will exceed DHS’s 
estimate. As shown in Table 10, the 
change will add additional requirements 
for registrants, and it will increase the 
time burden by an estimated 20 
minutes. DHS estimates the additional 
annual cost for registrants (employers), 
whether completed by an HR specialist, 
in-house lawyer, or outsourced lawyer, 
to be approximately $15 million. The 
change will add questions to the 
petition form, increasing the estimated 
time burden by 15 minutes. DHS 
estimates the additional annual cost to 
petitioners (employers) at 
approximately $15 million (see Table 
18). The total estimated annual cost to 
employers will be about $30 million. 
Comment: Some commenters stated that the DHS analysis did not 
adequately assess the impact of 
international students and workers’ 
contribution to the STEM workforce and 
the resulting impact on the U.S. 
economy. A commenter cited economic 
research that demonstrates high-skilled 
immigration, especially those with 
STEM training, causes large increases in 
productivity and economic growth in 
the United States. Specifically, the 
commenter wrote, the increase in U.S. 
city-level productivity caused by 
inflows of foreign STEM workers from 
1990 to 2010 is sufficient in magnitude 
to explain between 30 and 50 percent of 
all aggregate productivity growth in the 
United States during that period. 
Moreover, the influx of highly skilled 
immigrant graduates to the United 
States during the 1990s caused a 12 to 
21 percent rise in the annual number of 
high-technology innovations reflected 
by annual patent applications, which in 
turn raised U.S. GDP per capita by 
between 1.4 and 2.4 percent—the 
equivalent, in today’s dollars, of adding 
$267–458 billion to the U.S. economy 
each year. And ‘‘a substantial reduction 
in the supply of foreign talent to the 
U.S. workforce will have large, negative, 
and lasting effects on productivity and 
economic growth in the United States.’’ 
The commenter further estimated that 
if the number of foreign STEM graduates 
from U.S. universities drops by 10 
percent, due to policies that deter 
foreign students from enrolling or 
staying, this would reduce the total 
supply of high-skilled STEM workers in 
the United States by 1.9 percent. In turn, 
this reduction in high-skilled foreign 
STEM workers would decrease annual 
Total Factor Productivity growth by 
0.024 to 0.048 percentage points. Over 
a decade, this would make U.S. GDP 
0.24 to 0.48 percent smaller than it 
otherwise would have been. In today’s 
terms, that would equal a loss of $72– 
$145 billion—comparable to the entire 
economy of a small U.S. state, such as 
Delaware or New Hampshire. The loss 
of international STEM talent would not 
just affect tech hubs like Silicon Valley 
and Boston, but also innovation clusters 
across the country—including the 
South, Midwest, and smaller cities that 
rely on international graduates to 
compete globally. These regions could 
see weakened innovation ecosystems 
and reduced competitiveness. 
Another commenter stated 
international students are critical to the 
U.S. STEM workforce, making up about 
20 percent of all STEM graduates and 44 
percent of advanced STEM degree 
recipients. They contribute 
disproportionately to U.S. innovation, 
filing more patents and starting more 
businesses than U.S. natives or other 
immigrants. Similarly, although H–1B 
nonimmigrants are a small share of the 
total U.S. workforce, they make up a 
significant portion of highly educated 
workers in technology-intensive 
industries. The commenter cited 
academic research showing that H–1B 
workers earn more than similar U.S. 
workers, fill critical skill shortages, 
boost productivity, and drive 
innovation, helping the United States 
maintain a competitive edge in science 
and technology. According to the 
commenter, the proposed process could 
make it harder for international students 
to transition from F–1 to H–1B status, 
narrowing the early-career talent 
pipeline. This would reduce the 
economic benefits of the H–1B program 
and threaten U.S. competitiveness in 
key sectors. The potential costs of this 
reduction could far outweigh any wage 
gains from the new system. Finally, a 
commenter estimated that the present 
value of the lost contributions from even 
a single talented worker over a 30–40- 
year career would easily reach millions 
of dollars in economic value. Multiplied 
across 10,000 workers annually, the 
long-term cost to the American economy 
would reach hundreds of billions of 
dollars. 
Response: DHS appreciates the commenters’ detailed discussion of the 
economic literature on the contributions 
of international students and highly 
skilled foreign workers to U.S. 
innovation, productivity, and long-run 
economic growth. DHS recognizes that 
highly skilled foreign STEM graduates 
and H–1B workers play an important 
role in the U.S. economy and that high- 
skilled migration has been associated 
with increased patenting, productivity 
growth, and expansions in technology- 
intensive sectors. DHS also 
acknowledges that international 
students constitute a substantial share of 
advanced STEM degree recipients and 
contribute to U.S. research and 
development capacity. 
However, DHS disagrees that the H– 
1B weighted selection process would 
diminish these contributions or that the 
rule requires a separate productivity- or 
innovation-specific economic impact 
analysis. The commenters’ discussion 
largely describes the macroeconomic 
benefits of high-skilled immigration in 
general, not the direct effects of any 
particular H–1B selection mechanism. 
The new weighted selection process 
does not reduce the overall number of 
H–1B cap-subject workers, but it 
changes the likely distribution of

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260929 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations selection across wage levels. The rule 
does not restrict participation by 
employers in STEM fields, innovation 
hubs, or critical technology sectors. 
Accordingly, the assertions that the rule 
would reduce the overall foreign talent 
are speculative and lack empirical 
support. 
b. Impacts on U.S. Workers 
Comment: A commenter stated that contrary to DHS claims that H–1B 
workers displace U.S. workers, research 
by the National Foundation for 
American Policy demonstrates that H– 
1B professionals complement U.S. 
workers. The commenter wrote that the 
presence of H–1B workers is associated 
with lower unemployment rates among 
college graduates, faster earnings growth 
for U.S. workers in fields with more H– 
1B nonimmigrants, and better career 
alignment for U.S.-born graduates. The 
commenter argued that data show that 
increasing the share of H–1B workers in 
an occupation reduces unemployment 
and boosts wage growth for U.S. 
workers, with no evidence of 
displacement, even among recent 
graduates. Thus, restricting H–1B visas 
could inadvertently harm U.S. workers 
by reducing opportunities for 
collaboration, innovation, and overall 
job growth. Another commenter cited 
research indicating that H–1B workers 
are generally complements, not 
substitutes, for U.S. workers, and help 
prevent offshoring of jobs. 
Response: DHS appreciates the commenters’ reference to research 
suggesting that high-skilled foreign 
workers, including H–1B workers, 
complement U.S. workers and may 
contribute to innovation, collaboration, 
and economic growth. However, DHS 
disagrees with the commenters that the 
new weighted selection process would 
restrict H–1B visas. The rule is designed 
to increase the chance of selection for 
higher-paid, higher-skilled beneficiaries 
in years of excess demand for 
numerically limited H–1B visas. The 
rule does not restrict access to the 
program, reduce the number of H–1B 
workers, or respond to general labor- 
market effects. Also, the analysis cited 
by the commenter does not suggest that 
a reduction in the share of H–1B 
workers in an occupation would 
increase unemployment or lower wage 
growth. The studies the commenter cites 
generally examine correlations between 
higher H–1B presence and positive 
labor-market indicators. These studies 
do not establish causality. 
c. Impacts on USCIS 
Comment: One commenter predicted that the new rule would result in a 
greater burden on USCIS employees to 
examine and differentiate between 
occupational definitions, increasing the 
time spent reviewing each petition. 
Another commenter suggested that 
verification requirements of ensuring 
that the petition wages match 
registration wages could increase 
processing times and increase 
operational costs for USCIS, potentially 
leading to increased fees. 
Response: DHS agrees that the new weighted selection process will require 
updates to USCIS IT systems for 
registration and additional time by 
USCIS adjudicators to review newly 
required information during the 
adjudication of the petition. DHS notes 
that if the rule increases USCIS’ costs, 
then the fee schedule adjustment would 
be determined at USCIS’ next 
comprehensive biennial fee review. 
5. Benefits 
Comment: A commenter supporting the proposed weighted selection process 
stated that a benefit of the rule could be 
increased average salaries in specialty 
occupations and that could raise wages 
for U.S. workers. The commenter further 
stated that this rule could benefit U.S. 
STEM graduates who are currently 
facing difficulties finding employment, 
explaining that U.S. tech workers have 
been harmed by the abuse of the H–1B 
program to bring in lower-paid workers 
compared to U.S. workers. 
Response: DHS appreciates comments and analysis submitted by U.S. tech 
workers who believe their careers have 
been harmed by decades of industries’ 
reliance on the H–1B program to 
provide foreign entry-level workers at 
level I and II wages that are, by 
definition, below the median for their 
occupation. The Department aims to 
implement the numerical cap in a way 
that incentivizes employers to offer 
higher wages, or to petition for positions 
requiring higher skills and higher- 
skilled aliens, that are commensurate 
with higher wage levels. The rule would 
favor the allocation of H–1B visas to 
higher-skilled and higher-paid aliens, 
while maintaining the opportunity for 
employers to secure H–1B workers at all 
wage levels. DHS believes that this is 
expected to increase average salaries 
among selected H–1B cap-subject 
workers, while also better protecting the 
wages, working conditions, and job 
opportunities of U.S. workers. 
Comment: A commenter disagreed with the Department’s assessment that 
increased wages paid to H–1B 
nonimmigrants would benefit the U.S. 
economy. While DHS’s analysis 
concluded that higher wages paid to H– 
1B workers could increase overall 
economic activity and tax revenue, the 
commenter stated that U.S. employers 
are more likely to lose access to 
essential skills, leading to delays in 
productivity and innovation, disruption 
of critical services, and even the 
abandonment or relocation of projects 
outside the United States. The 
commenter wrote that these 
consequences impose real costs on the 
American economy that outweigh the 
theoretical benefits that DHS assessed. 
Response: DHS disagrees with the commenter. The commenter’s 
predictions that the rule will cause 
employers to lose access to essential 
skills, abandon projects, or relocate 
work outside the United States are 
speculative. The commenter did not 
provide any empirical evidence, such as 
documented cases, case level data, or 
any quantitative or qualitative analyses 
to support the claim. Without 
substantiating data, DHS cannot verify 
these claimed impacts or conclude that 
they would outweigh the benefits 
identified in the regulatory impact 
analysis. The rule does not change the 
statutory cap, restrict eligibility for H– 
1B classification, limit access for any 
particular industry, or alter employers’ 
ability to hire. 
Comment: A commenter said that estimated benefits (total salary 
increases) in Table 15 are unverifiable 
because H–1B petition data are not 
public and urged DHS to release 
petition and registration data. The 
commenter said DHS must provide the 
underlying data and assumptions so the 
public can assess the validity and 
impact of the proposed rule, and that 
the current record does not provide 
enough information for meaningful 
evaluation. The commenter specifically 
questioned how DHS converted hourly, 
weekly, or monthly pay into annual 
figures and handled implausibly low or 
high salaries that may reflect typos. 
Pointing to what the commenter 
described as factual and mathematical 
errors, the commenter urged DHS to 
release the underlying data and 
assumptions so the public can assess the 
validity of its conclusions and their 
impact on the H–1B program. The 
commenter argued that the notice does 
not provide enough information for 
meaningful public evaluation of the 
proposed rule. 
Response: DHS declines to release individual level raw data because DHS 
believes that the rulemaking record 
provides sufficient detail to allow 
meaningful evaluation of the estimates 
in Table 15 without disclosing raw data. 
Average annual salary estimates for H– 
1B cap-subject workers were derived 
from LCA wage data by converting all

reported pay frequencies to annual 
amounts using standard factors (hourly 
× 2,080; weekly × 52; monthly × 12; annual as reported) and then computing 
the mean. To mitigate undue influence 
from extreme high values and apparent 
entry errors, annualized wages were top 
coded at $1,000,000.
99
A review of the 
lower tail identified no anomalies, so no 
bottom-coding or exclusions were 
applied. DHS conducted quality checks 
to ensure internal consistency in the 
average annual salary for H–1B cap- 
subject workers. For these reasons, DHS 
disagrees that the estimates are 
unverifiable and regardless, DHS 
maintains that the current record 
provides adequate information for 
public review of the rule’s economic 
impact. 
6. Transfers 
Comment: A commenter stated that the DHS analysis that estimated $502 
million in annual benefits from the 
proposed rule is misleading. Rather than 
representing new economic value, the 
figure reflects a transfer of wages from 
lower-paid (level I) workers to higher- 
paid workers. According to the 
commenter, such a transfer is not a true 
benefit but a redistribution of existing 
resources and therefore DHS did not 
demonstrate that the rule creates new 
value or improved efficiency. 
Response: DHS disagrees with the commenter. As explained in the RIA, 
the estimated $502 million first-year 
effect reflects higher average wages 
among cap-subject H–1B workers 
selected under the weighted selection 
process relative to the baseline. The 
benefit captures the increased amount of 
total wages paid after implementation. 
The NPRM discusses separately the 
transfer of wages from lower-paid 
workers to higher-paid workers in the 
RIA. The estimated annual transfer is 
$858 million; with the fixed number of 
caps, shifting selections from level I to 
higher wage levels reallocates earnings 
from wage level I to higher wage levels. 
This reallocated portion of the earnings 
is captured as transfers, which is the 
total earnings of wage level I workers in 
the baseline. 
7. Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) 
Comment: A few commenters expressed support for the proposed 
information collection regarding wage 
levels, stating that these questions are 
necessary to ensure that the weighted 
selection process will function as 
intended and that the H–1B program is 
used to bring in highly skilled workers. 
These commenters stated that the 
burden of reporting the required 
information is minimal, especially 
compared to the benefits. 
Response: DHS agrees that the proposed information collection is 
necessary and beneficial, and will 
finalize the H–1B registration, petition 
form, and form instructions as 
proposed. 
Comment: A commenter said that the PRA burden is negligible compared to 
the costs that the failures of the H–1B 
program has imposed on U.S. workers 
and the United States economy through 
lost wages, displaced jobs, foregone 
innovation, and human costs. The 
commenter further said that the PRA 
analysis should be expanded to quantify 
these costs. 
Response: DHS believes that the PRA burden is relatively minor compared to 
the benefits of this rule. The new 
information collection is necessary and 
beneficial to enhance the integrity of the 
H–1B program and further prevent the 
harms that the commenter described. 
DHS declines to expand the PRA 
analysis because the PRA analysis is 
limited to the burdens associated with 
the information collection on the Form 
I–129, Form I–129 instructions, and the 
registration tool. The Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3501 
et seq., requires federal agencies to 
minimize paperwork burdens on the 
public; it does not require an agency to 
address costs outside of the information 
collection requirement. 
Comment: A commenter said that DHS’s treatment of information 
collection under the PRA is incomplete. 
Implementing a weighted selection 
process for H–1B visas would require 
new or revised information to be 
collected during registration, such as 
offered wage, DOL OEWS wage level, 
SOC code, and worksite location. These 
requirements would increase the time 
and cost for each registration, especially 
for employers without in-house 
immigration counsel, resulting in 
hundreds of thousands of additional 
burden hours and millions of dollars in 
annual costs. The commenter asserted 
that the proposal does not provide a 
clear, itemized accounting of these new 
burdens or evaluate alternatives to 
reduce them. The commenter asserts 
that DHS must publish a revised 60-day 
PRA notice with specific burden-hour 
and cost estimates, consider less 
burdensome alternatives, and obtain 
Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) approval before implementing 
the proposed process. Another 
commenter said that because DHS has 
proposed form revisions to implement 
this rule, employers will need time not 
only to review and comment on the 
proposed revisions, but also to adopt 
and ‘‘operationalize’’ the revised forms. 
This commenter said the introduction of 
revised forms would be ‘‘extremely 
disruptive’’ to firms already planning 
for the FY 2027 cap season. 
Response: DHS believes that the data collection requirements proposed with 
the NPRM will provide the information 
needed to implement the weighted 
selection process and no additional data 
elements are being added through this 
final rule. With no change to the form 
or instructions resulting from this 
comment, no change in burden needs to 
be addressed and updated from the 
burden estimate included in the NPRM. 
DHS also believes that the burden 
estimate associated with the data 
collections was accurately captured in 
the proposed rule, and no additional 
time for comment is necessary. DHS 
disagrees that the introduction of the 
new data collection requirements on the 
revised form will be extremely 
disruptive. DHS believes that the public 
has received sufficient notice of the 
weighted selection process and that 
employers will have sufficient time to 
operationalize the new data collection 
requirements on the revised form. 
Comment: A commenter opposed the information collection related to this 
rule, noting several concerns with the 
proposed additions to Form I–129, 
specifically, the proposed addition of 
questions 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 on the H– 
1B and H–1B1 Data Collection and 
Filing Fee Exemption Supplement. The 
commenter claimed that these 
additional questions are unnecessary, 
inconsistent with DOL processes, 
outside of DHS’s authority, represent a 
significant burden which was not 
adequately assessed in the proposed 
rule, and are beyond the scope of the 
rule. The commenter also stated that the 
information collection changes to the 
registration tool fail to provide adequate 
guidance to ensure compliance. 
Regarding Form I–129, H–1B and H– 
1B1 Data Collection and Filing Fee 
Exemption Supplement, the commenter 
claimed the additional questions 7 
through 11 are unnecessary, as the LCA 
already provides information about the 
SOC code, wage level and area of 
intended employment. The commenter 
claimed that these questions are outside 
the scope of the proposed rulemaking, 
as these questions relate to the 
prevailing wage level determination and 
the specialty occupation determination 
whereas the proposed rule is limited to 
the issue of administering the 
registration process for cap-subject 
petitions. The commenter additionally

While these questions derive from DOL 
prevailing wage guidance, DHS emphasizes that 
these questions serve different purposes than the 
LCA. 
101
DOL, Employment and Training 
Administration (ETA), Prevailing Wage 
Determination Policy Guidance: Nonagricultural 
Immigration Programs (last modified Nov. 2009). 
claimed that these questions are ultra 
vires because they solicit information 
about how a prevailing wage 
determination was made during the 
LCA process, so that USCIS can 
question whether the appropriate SOC 
code and wage level was selected. The 
commenter concluded that this 
information would be used to ‘‘second- 
guess’’ DOL’s determinations on the 
LCA which ‘‘exceeds USCIS’ authority 
over LCAs because Congress clearly 
vested the DOL with exclusive authority 
over LCAs’’ at INA section 212(n). 
Further, the commenter said that DHS 
failed to adequately assess the burden of 
adding these questions to the form, as 
these questions are applicable to all H– 
1B petitioners, not just those that are 
cap-subject. The commenter claimed 
that ‘‘[t]he proposed rule lacks any 
assessment of the impact in terms of the 
total universe of petitions filed with 
USCIS that would be subject to and 
impacted by this change.’’ 
Additionally, the commenter noted 
that the questions did not contain 
corresponding instructions. The 
commenter claimed that these questions 
are overly broad and confusing, and that 
the lack of instructions is a ‘‘fatal error.’’ 
Finally, regarding the registration 
tool, the commenter stated that the 
proposed form does not provide 
meaningful guidance for situations in 
which the OEWS wage information is 
unavailable for the relevant SOC code. 
The commenter requested a link to DOL 
guidance and ideally more detailed 
instructional language. 
Response: DHS disagrees with this commenter. Questions 7 through 11 on 
the supplement form are directly related 
to this rule. As stated in the NPRM and 
in this final rule, the submission of 
additional information on the petition 
form (including wage level information 
and the SOC code) allows USCIS to 
further improve the integrity of the H– 
1B cap selection and adjudication 
processes. Specifically, these new 
questions allow USCIS to confirm that: 
the registrant selected the correct wage 
level for the proffered position; the 
position information provided in the 
selected registration is the same as the 
information provided in the petition; 
the position information on the 
registration was true and correct and 
represents a bona fide job offer; and the 
filing of a new or amended petition was 
not part of an attempt to unfairly 
increase the odds of selection during the 
registration (or petition, if applicable) 
selection process. While DHS 
acknowledges that these questions have 
greater applicability beyond these 
purposes, these questions are 
nevertheless necessary for USCIS to 
ensure the integrity of the weighted 
selection process and the adjudication 
process. 
These questions do not merely 
duplicate the LCA process. While the 
LCA does provide information about the 
SOC code, wage level, and area of 
intended employment, DHS cannot rely 
solely on the information provided on 
the LCA for registration purposes 
because the LCA process differs from 
the process by which a registrant selects 
a wage level on the registration. 
Specifically, the weighted selection 
process takes into account the highest 
wage level that the proffered salary 
equals or exceeds, whereas the LCA 
wage level is based solely on the 
requirements of the position. In 
instances where the wage level marked 
on the registration differs from the LCA 
wage level, USCIS will rely on these 
questions to assess whether the wage 
level marked on the registration was 
appropriate. These questions are 
necessary for USCIS to determine 
whether there was any gaming during 
the registration process, which is fully 
consistent with USCIS’s authority to 
administer the cap selection process and 
ensure program integrity. 
DHS disagrees with the commenter’s 
assertion that these questions are 
outside the scope of DHS’ authority or 
that DOL has ‘‘exclusive authority over 
LCAs.’’ Contrary to the commenter’s 
assertion, DHS has broad authority to 
administer and enforce the INA. See 
INA sec. 103(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(1). 
USCIS may consider LCA-related issues 
in exercising its own authority to 
administer and enforce the INA, 
including provisions pertaining to the 
H–1B program. See ITServe All., Inc. v. 
DHS, 71 F.4th 1028, 1037 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (‘‘[P]olicing compliance with the 
terms of an LCA plainly constitutes 
‘administration and enforcement’ of the 
INA, which section 1103(a)(1) 
independently authorizes.’’). 
DHS also disagrees with the claim 
that the burden estimate was inadequate 
because all petitioners, not just those 
that are cap-subject, need to respond to 
these questions. In the NPRM, DHS 
estimated the burden of these additional 
questions ‘‘for all H–1B petitions, not 
just H–1B cap-subject petitions, because 
these requirements would apply to any 
H–1B petitions.’’ 90 FR at 46011. DHS 
believes the proposed placement of 
these questions in section 1 of the 
supplement was reasonable, as section 1 
requires petitioners to provide general 
information about the position 
including the major/primary field of 
study, rate of pay, SOC code, and 
NAICS code. DHS will maintain these 
questions in section 1 of the 
supplement. 
Further, DHS declines to add 
corresponding instructions for these 
questions. DHS disagrees that these 
questions are overly broad and 
confusing, and instead, believes these 
questions are self-explanatory. These 
questions generally derive from DOL 
prevailing wage guidance, with which 
most if not all H–1B petitioners should 
be familiar.
100
For example, question 7, 
which asks, ‘‘What level of education is 
required for the position?,’’ tracks with 
step 3 of the DOL guidance, which 
requires petitioners to compare the 
education requirement generally 
required for an occupation to the 
education requirement in the 
employer’s job offer. 
Finally, DHS disagrees that the 
registration tool fails to provide 
adequate guidance. As stated in the 
NPRM, in the limited instance where 
there is no current OEWS prevailing 
wage information for the proffered 
position, the registrant would follow 
DOL guidance on PWDs to determine 
which OEWS wage level to select on the 
registration. 90 FR 45986, 45993 (Sept. 
24, 2025). This sentence included a 
footnote to the proper guidance in effect 
as of the time of publication of the 
NPRM.
101
It is possible that DOL will 
update their guidance in the future. In 
such case, registrants would use any 
updated version of the Prevailing Wage 
Determination guidance published by 
DOL. 
8. Other Regulatory Requirements 
Comment: A commenter said that the rule contradicts the deregulation goals 
of Executive Order 14192, Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation. 
Response: DHS disagrees with the commenter’s assertion that this rule 
contradicts E.O. 14192, as this E.O. 
expressly states that it does not include 
regulations issued with respect to an 
immigration-related function of the 
United States. This final rule pertains to 
the administration of the annual 
numerical allocations for H–1B 
nonimmigrants under section 214(g) of 
the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1184(g), and is 
therefore an immigration-related 
function of the United States. 
Comment: A commenter said that DHS should be required to clarify its 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:36 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00069 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\29DER2.SGM 29DER2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260932 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations 102
Under 2 U.S.C. 658(6) and 1502, the term 
‘‘Federal mandate’’ means a Federal 
intergovernmental mandate or a Federal private 
sector mandate, as defined in 2 U.S.C. 658(5) and 
(7). Specifically, UMRA defines the term ‘‘Federal 
private sector mandate’’ as any provision in 
legislation, statute, or regulation that would impose 
an enforceable duty upon the private sector except, 
among other things, a duty arising from 
participation in a voluntary Federal program. 
(UMRA) determination and explain the 
basis for concluding that private-sector 
expenditures do not meet UMRA 
thresholds because the proposed 
weighted selection process would likely 
increase private-sector compliance 
expenditures (as discussed under the 
PRA) and create significant 
distributional effects. 
Response: DHS disagrees with the commenter that it should clarify its 
UMRA statement in the rule. As 
discussed in that section of this rule, 
neither the proposed nor the final rule 
constitute a Federal mandate for 
purposes of UMRA.
102
Particularly with 
respect to the Federal private sector 
mandates, this rule imposes no 
enforceable duty on the private sector. 
Rather the H–1B program is voluntary, 
and this rule establishes a process for 
selection where employers may, but are 
not required to, offer higher wages to 
beneficiaries they wish to sponsor in 
order to increase their chances of 
selection. For these reasons, no further 
analysis is required. 
H. Out of Scope 
Numerous commenters provided 
comments outside the scope of this 
rulemaking (e.g., comments seeking changes in regulations and agency 
policies unrelated to the changes 
proposed in the NPRM). DHS provides 
a brief overview of the out of scope 
comments below. However, DHS is not 
providing substantive responses to those 
comments as they address policy 
questions beyond the limited changes 
proposed and cannot be resolved 
through this rulemaking. Comments that 
DHS considered out of scope include: 
€General comments about terminating the H–1B program or 
halting immigration in general; 
€General comments about the qualities of H–1B workers; 
€General comments calling for comprehensive H–1B reform and urging 
DHS to make structural changes, 
including changes to the statutory cap; 
€Comments solely about the $100,000 fee pursuant to the H–1B 
Proclamation; 
€Comments about H–1B renewals, including suggestions for new fees for 
renewals; 
€General concerns about staffing or outsourcing companies, and requests to 
ban such companies from the H–1B 
program permanently or for a limited 
period of time; 
€Comments that would require DOL action, such as increasing the H–1B 
prevailing wage and improving DOL 
audits; 
€Comments that would require joint DHS and DOL action, such as enhanced 
employee screening and deploying a 
digital platform to aid recruitment of 
U.S. workers; 
€Comments about the L–1 visa program and perceived abuse of that 
program; 
€Comments about the F–1 visa program and OPT/Curricular Practical 
Training; 
€Comments about H–4 nonimmigrant status and employment 
authorization for H–4 spouses; 
€Comments about other immigration programs, including the J–1, O–1, and 
H–2 nonimmigrant classifications and 
the EB–1 immigrant classification. 
IV. Statutory and Regulatory 
Requirements 
A. Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory 
Planning and Review), 13563 
(Improving Regulation and Regulatory 
Review), and 14192 (Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation) 
Executive Orders 12866 (Regulatory 
Planning and Review) and 13563 
(Improving Regulation and Regulatory 
Review) direct agencies to assess the 
costs and benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits. 
Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the 
importance of quantifying both costs 
and benefits, of reducing costs, of 
harmonizing rules, and of promoting 
flexibility. Executive Order 14192 
(Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation) directs agencies to 
significantly reduce the private 
expenditures required to comply with 
Federal regulations and provides that 
‘‘any new incremental costs associated 
with new regulations shall, to the extent 
permitted by law, be offset by the 
elimination of existing costs associated 
with at least 10 prior regulations.’’ 
This rule has been designated a 
‘‘significant regulatory action’’ that is 
economically significant, under section 
3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866. 
Accordingly, the rule has been reviewed 
by the Office of Management and 
Budget. 
This rule is not an Executive Order 
14192 regulatory action because it is 
being issued with respect to an 
immigration-related function of the 
United States. The rule’s primary direct 
purpose is to implement or interpret the 
immigration laws of the United States 
(as described in INA sec. 101(a)(17), 8 
U.S.C. 1101(a)(17)) or any other function 
performed by the U.S. Federal 
Government with respect to aliens. See 
OMB Memorandum M–25–20, Guidance 
Implementing Section 3 of Executive 
Order 14192, titled ‘Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation’ (Mar. 
26, 2025). 
1. Summary of Changes From the Notice 
of Proposed Rulemaking 
In this final rule, the estimated 10- 
year total benefits and transfers are 17 
percent higher than in the NPRM. This 
change reflects updated data on the 
average tenure of cap-subject H–1B 
workers, including extensions. The 
NPRM assumed a 4-year average period 
of stay as an H–1B nonimmigrant. The 
final rule uses a 5-year average based on 
observed extensions, including those 
available beyond the standard six-year 
limit. The longer average duration 
means benefits and transfers accrue for 
more time, increasing the 10-year totals 
by accounting for an additional year of 
annual benefits ($502 million) and 
transfers ($858 million). Figures in 
Tables 4 and 16–21 have been updated 
to reflect the most recent data source 
and may differ immaterially from those 
in the NPRM. Table 1.2 summarizes the 
changes in estimated annualized and 
discounted impacts from the proposed 
rule to the final rule.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260933 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations 2. Summary of Changes 
As discussed in the preamble, the 
purpose of this rule is to amend DHS 
regulations governing the process by 
which USCIS selects H–1B registrations 
for filing of H–1B cap-subject petitions 
(or H–1B petitions for any year in which 
the registration requirement will be 
suspended), by implementing a process 
in which all unique beneficiaries, while 
still randomly selected, will be 
weighted generally according to the 
highest OEWS wage level that the 
proffered wage equals or exceeds for the 
relevant SOC code in the area(s) of 
intended employment. Specifically, 
USCIS will weight and select each 
unique beneficiary (or petition, if 
registration is suspended) as follows: a 
beneficiary (or petition) assigned to 
wage level IV will be entered into the 
selection pool four times, a beneficiary 
(or petition) assigned to wage level III 
will be entered into the selection pool 
three times, a beneficiary (or petition) 
assigned to wage level II will be entered 
into the selection pool two times, and a 
beneficiary (or petition) assigned to 
wage level I will be entered into the 
selection pool one time. 
For the 10-year implementation 
period of the rule (FY2026 through 
FY2035), DHS estimates the annual 
costs will be about $30 million. DHS 
estimates the annual net benefits 
(undiscounted) will be approximately 
$472 million in FY2026, $974 million in 
FY2027, $1,476 million in FY2028, 
$1,978 million in FY2029, and $2,480 
million in each year from FY2030 
through FY2035. DHS estimates the 
annualized net benefits of the rule will 
be about $1,925 million at 3 percent and 
$1,854 million at 7 percent. DHS 
estimates the annual transfers 
(undiscounted) will be approximately 
$858 million in FY2026, $1,717 million 
in FY2027, $2,575 million in FY2028, 
$3,434 million in FY2029 and $4,292 
million in each year from FY2030 
through FY2035. DHS estimates the 
annualized transfers of the rule will be 
about $3,343 million at 3 percent and 
$3,222 million at 7 percent. 
Table 1.3 provides a detailed 
summary of estimated quantifiable and 
unquantifiable impacts of the final rule.

3. Background and Population 
The H–1B nonimmigrant visa program 
allows U.S. employers to temporarily 
hire foreign workers to perform services 
in a specialty occupation, services 
related to a DOD cooperative research 
and development project or 
coproduction project, or services of 
distinguished merit and ability in the 
field of fashion modeling.
104
A specialty 
occupation is defined as an occupation 
that requires the (1) theoretical and 
practical application of a body of highly 
specialized knowledge and (2) 
attainment of a bachelor’s or higher 
degree in the specific specialty (or its 
equivalent) as a minimum qualification 
for entry into the occupation in the 
United States. See INA sec. 214(i)(l), 8 U.S.C. 1184(i)(l). 
The number of aliens who may be 
issued initial H–1B visas or otherwise 
provided initial H–1B nonimmigrant 
status during any fiscal year has been 
capped at various levels by Congress 
over time, with the current numerical 
limit being 65,000 per fiscal year. See 
INA sec. 214(g)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. 
1184(g)(1)(A). Congress has also 
provided for various exemptions from 
this annual numerical limit, including 
an exemption for 20,000 aliens who 
have earned a master’s or higher degree 
from a U.S. institution of higher 
education. See INA secs. 214(g)(5) and (7), 8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(5) and (7). 
Under the current regulation, all 
petitioners seeking to file an H–1B cap- 
subject petition must first electronically 
submit a registration for each 
beneficiary on whose behalf they seek to 
file an H–1B cap-subject petition, unless 
USCIS suspends the registration 
requirement. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A). USCIS monitors the

producer surplus to the petitioners who registered at wage level I and were not selected due to the changes. This transfer will be an unquantifiable benefit in terms of gained producer surplus to the petitioners who registered at higher wage levels and got their H-1 B registrations selected due to the higher probability of getting selected. From wage level I H-1 B petitioners to wage level 11, 111, and IV H-18 petitioners. NIA 
OHS estimates that the final rule will result in a 
significant economic impact on 5,193 small entities (30 percent of small entities that filed a cap-subject petition in FY 2024) due to loss of 
labor.

The terms ‘‘Non-master’s’’ and ‘‘Master’s or 
higher’’ used in this analysis refer to the 
beneficiary’s degree type, not which cap type they 
were selected under.

number of H–1B registrations for unique 
beneficiaries properly submitted during 
the announced registration period of at 
least 14 days. At the conclusion of that 
period, if more registrations for unique 
beneficiaries are submitted than 
projected as needed to reach the 
numerical allocations, USCIS randomly 
selects from among unique beneficiaries 
for whom registrations were properly 
submitted, the number of unique 
beneficiaries projected as needed to 
reach the H–1B numerical allocations. 
See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(5) and (6). Under this purely random H–1B 
registration selection process, USCIS 
first selects from a pool of all unique 
beneficiaries, including those eligible 
for the advanced degree exemption. 
USCIS then selects from the remaining 
unique beneficiaries a sufficient number 
projected as needed to reach the 
advanced degree exemption. A 
prospective petitioner that properly 
registered for a beneficiary who is 
selected is notified of the selection and 
instructed that the petitioner is eligible 
to file an H–1B cap-subject petition for 
the beneficiary named in the selected 
registration within a filing period that is 
at least 90 days in duration. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(3). When registration 
is required, a petitioner seeking to file 
an H–1B cap-subject petition is not 
eligible to file the petition unless the 
petition is based on a valid, selected 
registration for the beneficiary named in 
the petition. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(1). 
In general, prior to filing an H–1B 
petition, the employer is required to 
obtain a certified LCA from the DOL. 
See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(i)(B). The LCA collects information about the employer 
and the occupation for the H–1B 
worker(s). The LCA requires certain 
attestations from the employer, 
including, among others, that the 
employer will pay the H–1B worker(s) at 
least the required wage. See 20 CFR 655.731 through 735. 
This final rule will amend DHS 
regulations concerning the selection of 
electronic registrations submitted by or 
on behalf of prospective petitioners 
seeking to file H–1B cap-subject 
petitions (or the selection of petitions, if 
the registration process is suspended), 
which includes petitions subject to the 
regular cap and those asserting 
eligibility for the advanced degree 
exemption, to allow for weighting and 
selection generally based on OEWS 
wage levels for simultaneously 
submitted registrations (including 
registrations submitted within the same 
window of time). When applicable, 
USCIS will weight and select the 
registrations for unique beneficiaries (or 
petitions) received generally based on 
the highest OEWS wage level that the 
beneficiary’s proffered wage would 
equal or exceed for the relevant SOC 
code and in the area(s) of intended 
employment. Although the allocation of 
regular cap (65,000) slots and advanced 
degree exemption (20,000) slots are 
approximately 75 percent and 25 
percent respectively, the multiple-stage 
random selection process results in an 
increased probability that H–1B 
beneficiaries with a qualifying master’s 
degree or higher will be selected. 
Table 3 shows the number of H–1B 
registrations received for beneficiaries 
without a qualifying master’s degree 
(Non-master’s), and with a qualifying 
master’s degree or above (Master’s or 
higher) for FY 2020 through FY 2024.
105
 
Table 3 includes the number of unique 
beneficiaries because DHS implemented 
a beneficiary-centric selection process 
for H–1B registrations in FY 2024 (for 
the FY 2025 cap selection process), 
which is when USCIS started selecting 
registrations by unique beneficiary 
instead of selecting by registration. 89 
FR 7456 (Feb. 2, 2024). Based on a 5- 
year annual average, DHS estimates the 
annual average receipts of registrations 
to be 465,523. The 5-year annual 
average of registrations received for non- 
master’s is 299,935, the 5-year annual 
average of registrations received for 
master’s or higher is 165,587, and the 5- 
year annual average of number of 
unique beneficiaries with eligible 
registrations is 320,711. 
Table 4 shows the number of H–1B 
cap-subject petitions (Form I–129, 
Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker) 
received for non-master’s and master’s 
or higher as well as historical Form G– 
28 filings by attorneys or accredited 
representatives accompanying H–1B 
cap-subject petitions for FY 2020 
through FY 2024. DHS notes that these 
forms are not mutually exclusive. Based 
on the 5-year average, DHS estimates 80 
percent of H–1B cap-subject petitions 
will be filed with Form G–28.

Providing the area of intended employment 
that corresponds to the lowest equivalent wage 
level at registration will not preclude the registrant, 
if selected and eligible to file a petition, from listing 
any additional concurrent work location(s) on the 
petition. 
108
For instance, in the case of multiple positions, 
if DHS were to instead require registrants to select 
the box for the highest corresponding OEWS wage 
level that the proffered wage were to equal or 
exceed, then a petitioner could place the 
beneficiary in a lower paying position for most of 
the time and a higher paying position for only a 
small percent of the time, but use that higher paying 
position to increase their chances of being selected 
in the registration process. Similarly, in the case of 
multiple locations, a petitioner could place the 
beneficiary in a higher paying locality for only a 
small percent of time but use that higher paying 
locality to increase their chances of being selected 
in the registration process. 
109
OFLC, a component of DOL, administers the 
OFLC Wage Search for OEWS prevailing wage 
information at https://flag.dol.gov/wage-data/wage- 
search (last visited Dec. 8, 2025). petitions for beneficiaries with master’s 
or higher degrees than 20,000 because 
some beneficiaries with master’s or 
higher degrees are selected during the 
regular cap selection process. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(5). 
In this analysis, DHS uses historical 
data of both registrations and received 
petitions to estimate the future 
registration and petition population. 
Specifically, DHS uses 5-year averages 
to estimate the number of registrations 
and H–1B cap-subject petitions received 
annually. DHS does not adjust these 
estimates to account for the H–1B 
Proclamation because, as discussed 
earlier in this preamble, (1) that 
Proclamation applies to only a subset of 
H–1B petitions, (2) exceptions to the 
$100,000 payment may be granted by 
the Secretary of Homeland Security to 
any individual alien, all aliens working 
for a company, or all aliens working in 
an industry; and (3) the H–1B 
Proclamation will expire, absent 
extension, 12 months from its effective 
date. This rule, in contrast, will 
continue indefinitely. DHS 
acknowledges that the rule’s effects 
could differ in years when the H–1B 
Proclamation or a similar policy is in 
effect, but for the reasons stated above 
DHS is unable to adjust for the potential 
impacts of the Proclamation. 
4. Costs, Transfers, and Benefits of the 
Final Rule 
a. Required Information on the 
Registration 
For purposes of the weighting and 
selection process in this rulemaking, a 
registrant will be required to select the 
box for the highest OEWS wage level 
(‘‘wage level IV,’’ ‘‘wage level III,’’ 
‘‘wage level II,’’ or ‘‘wage level I’’) that 
the beneficiary’s proffered wage 
generally equals or exceeds for the 
relevant SOC code in the area(s) of 
intended employment. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(4)(i). The registrant 
will also be required to provide the 
appropriate SOC code of the proffered 
position and the area of intended 
employment that served as the basis for 
the OEWS wage level indicated on the 
registration, in addition to any other 
information required on the electronic 
registration form (and on the H–1B 
petition) as specified in the registration 
form instructions. 
For registrants relying on a prevailing 
wage that is not based on the OEWS 
survey, if the proffered wage is less than 
the corresponding level I OEWS wage, 
the registrant will select the ‘‘wage level 
I’’ box on the registration form. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(4)(i). If the 
proffered wage is expressed as a range, 
the registrant will select the OEWS wage 
level that the lowest wage in the range 
will equal or exceed. If the H–1B 
beneficiary will work in multiple 
locations, or in multiple positions if the 
registrant is an agent, the registrant will 
select the box for the lowest equivalent 
wage level among the corresponding 
wage levels for each of those locations 
or each of those positions and will list 
the location corresponding to that 
lowest equivalent wage level as the area 
of intended employment.
107
Id. The provision to require a registrant to select 
the lowest among the corresponding 
wage levels if a beneficiary will work in 
multiple locations, or in multiple 
positions if the registrant is an agent, is 
meant to prevent gaming of the 
weighted selection process.
108
 
DHS recognizes that some 
occupations do not have current OEWS 
prevailing wage information available 
on DOL’s OFLC Wage Search 
website.
109
In the limited instance 
where there is no current OEWS 
prevailing wage information for the 
proffered position, such that there are 
not four wage levels for the 
occupational classification or there are 
not wage data for the area of intended 
employment, the registrant will follow 
DOL guidance on PWDs to determine 
which OEWS wage level to select on the

DHS limited its analysis to HR specialists, in-

estimated costs. However, DHS understands that 
not all entities employ individuals with these 
occupations and, therefore, recognizes equivalent 
occupations may also prepare and submit these 
registrations.

cost to employers for wages and salaries and 
benefits per employee hour worked. 
registration.
110
DHS expects each 
registrant will be able to identify the 
appropriate SOC code for the proffered 
position because all petitioners are 
required to identify the appropriate SOC 
code for the proffered position on the 
LCA, even when there are no applicable 
wage level data available or the OEWS 
survey is not used as the prevailing 
wage source on the LCA. Using the SOC 
code and the previously mentioned DOL 
guidance, all registrants will be able to 
determine the appropriate OEWS wage 
level for purposes of completing the 
registration, regardless of whether they 
were to specify an OEWS wage level or 
utilize the OEWS program as the 
prevailing wage source on an LCA. 
This change will add additional 
requirements for registrants. DHS 
estimates that this change will increase 
the time burden by 20 minutes for each 
registration (0.3333 hours) from 36 
minutes (0.6 hours) to 56 minutes 
(0.9333 hours). The change will offer 
qualitative benefits. Specifically, 
submission of additional wage level 
information and the SOC code on both 
an electronic registration and on Form 
I–129 will result in the benefit of 
allowing USCIS to further improve the 
integrity of the H–1B cap selection and 
adjudication processes. 
Table 5 shows the number of total H– 
1B registrations and estimated total 
registrations with Form G–28 attached. 
Based on a 5-year annual average, DHS 
estimates the annual average 
registrations are 465,523. The estimated 
5-year annual average of registrations 
with Form G–28 attached is 180,970. 
DHS estimates the opportunity cost of 
time of gathering and preparing 
information by multiplying the 
estimated increased time burden for 
those submitting an H–1B registration 
by the compensation rate of a human 
resources (HR) specialist, in-house 
lawyer, or outsourced lawyer, 
respectively. 
In order to estimate the opportunity 
cost of time for completing and 
submitting an H–1B registration, DHS 
assumes that a prospective petitioner 
will use an HR specialist, an in-house 
lawyer, or an outsourced lawyer to 
prepare an H–1B registration.
111
DHS 
uses the mean hourly wage of $36.57 for 
HR specialists to estimate the 
opportunity cost of the time for 
preparing and submitting an H–1B 
registration.
112
Additionally, DHS uses 
the mean hourly wage of $84.84 for in- 
house lawyers to estimate the 
opportunity cost of the time for 
preparing and submitting an H–1B 
registration.
113
 
DHS accounts for worker benefits 
when estimating the total costs of 
compensation by calculating a benefits- 
to-wage multiplier using the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics (BLS) report detailing 
the average employer costs for employee 
compensation for all civilian workers in 
major occupational groups and 
industries. DHS estimates that the 
benefits-to-wage multiplier is 1.45 and, 
therefore, is able to estimate the full 
opportunity cost per registration, 
including employee wages and salaries 
and the full cost of benefits, such as 
paid leave, insurance, retirement, etc.

The DHS analysis in Exercise of Time-Limited 
Authority to Increase the Fiscal Year 2018 
Numerical Limitation for the H–2B Temporary 
Nonagricultural Worker Program, 83 FR 24905 (May 
31, 2018), used a multiplier of 2.5 to convert in- 
house attorney wages to the cost of outsourced 
attorney wages. 
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
rule, Final Small Entity Impact Analysis: ‘Safe- 
Harbor Procedures for Employers Who Receive a 
No-Match Letter’ at G–4 (Aug. 25, 2008), https://
www.regulations.gov/document/ICEB-2006-0004-

attorney based on information received in public 
comment to that rule. The methodology used in that 
analysis remains sound for using 2.5 as a multiplier 
for outsourced labor wages in this rule. 
of $53.03 per hour for an HR 
specialist
115
and $123.02 per hour for 
an in-house lawyer.
116
DHS recognizes 
that a firm may choose, but is not 
required, to outsource the preparation of 
these registrations and, therefore, 
presents two wage rates for lawyers. To 
determine the full opportunity costs of 
time if a firm hired an outsourced 
lawyer, DHS multiplied the average 
hourly U.S. wage rate for lawyers by 2.5 
for a total of $212.10 to approximate an 
hourly cost for an outsourced lawyer to 
prepare and submit an H–1B 
registration.
117
 
DHS does not know the exact number 
of registrants who will choose an in- 
house or an outsourced lawyer but 
assumes it may be a 50/50 split and, 
therefore, provides an average. The 
estimated number of registrations with 
Form G–28 attached is 180,970 from 
Table 5. Table 6 shows the current total 
annual average cost for a lawyer to 
complete the registration on behalf of a 
prospective petitioner. The current 
opportunity cost of time for submitting 
an H–1B registration using an attorney 
or other representative is estimated to 
range from $13,357,758 to $23,030,242, 
with an average of $18,194,000. 
To estimate the current remaining 
opportunity cost of time for an HR 
specialist submitting an H–1B 
registration without a lawyer, DHS 
applies the estimated public reporting 
time burden (0.6 hours) to the 
compensation rate of an HR specialist. 
Table 7 estimates the current total 
annual opportunity cost of time to HR 
specialists completing and submitting 
an H–1B registration will be 
approximately $9,053,907. 
Table 8 shows the final estimated 
time burden will increase by 20 minutes 
(0.3333 hours) to 56 minutes (0.9333 
hours) to the eligible population and 
compensation rates of those who may 
submit registrations with or without a 
lawyer due to changes in the 
instructions, adding clarifying language 
regarding denying or revoking approved 
H–1B petitions, adding passport or 
travel document instructional language, 
and providing the corresponding wage 
level, the appropriate SOC code of the 
proffered position, and the area of 
intended employment that served as the 
basis for the OEWS wage level indicated 
on the registration. DHS does not know

In the current selection process for H– 
1B registrations, USCIS randomly 
selects from among properly submitted 
registrations the number of unique 
beneficiaries projected as needed to 
reach the H–1B numerical allocations. 
This final rule will change the way 
USCIS selects unique beneficiaries, and 
the registrations submitted on their 
behalf for H–1B cap-subject petitions (or 
petitions, if the registration process is 
suspended), including those eligible for 
the advanced degree exemption. USCIS 
will weight and select the registrations 
for unique beneficiaries (or petitions) 
received generally on the basis of the 
highest OEWS wage level that the 
beneficiary’s proffered wage will equal 
or exceed for the relevant SOC code in 
the area(s) of intended employment. The 
changes to weight and select 
registrations will result in the benefit of 
increasing the chance that registrations 
or petitions, as applicable, will be 
selected for higher paid, and 
presumably higher-skilled or higher- 
valued, beneficiaries. 
Congress has established the limits on 
certain initial H–1B nonimmigrant visas 
or status grants each fiscal year not to 
exceed 65,000 (regular cap) with an 
annual exemption for those who have 
earned a qualifying U.S. master’s degree 
or higher from a U.S. institution of 
higher education not to exceed 20,000 
(advanced degree exemption). USCIS 
monitors the number of H–1B 
registrations for unique beneficiaries it 
receives during the announced 
registration period. At the conclusion of 
the registration period, USCIS randomly 
selects from among properly submitted 
registrations a number of registrations 
for unique beneficiaries projected as 
needed to reach the H–1B numerical 
allocations. Although the allocation of 
regular cap (65,000) and advanced 
degree exemption (20,000) are 
approximately 75 percent and 25 
percent respectively, the multiple-stage 
random selection process results in an 
increased probability that H–1B 
beneficiaries with a master’s degree or 
higher will be selected. Table 11 shows 
the historical numbers of H–1B cap- 
subject petitions received by wage level 
and by the beneficiary’s degree type for 
FY 2020 through FY 2024. Based on the 
5-year annual average, DHS estimates 
the annual average receipts of H–1B 
cap-subject petitions are 94,900 per 
year. The 5-year annual average of non- 
master’s degree receipts is 46,379, and 
the 5-year annual average of master’s or 
higher degree receipts is 48,522.

Table 12 presents the percentage of 
H–1B cap-subject receipts by wage 
levels for the estimated 94,900 average 
annual receipts, based on corresponding 
5-year averages for FY 2020 through FY 
2024. For both non-master’s degree and 
master’s or higher degree, wage level II 
has the most H–1B receipts followed, in 
order, by level I, level III, and level IV. 
Master’s or higher degree petitions have 
slightly more receipts in level I and 
level II as shown by the cumulative 
percentage of 86 percent compared to 
the non-master’s degree petitions’ 
cumulative percentage of 81 percent. 
Currently, wage level data are only 
collected for those beneficiaries who 
were selected in the registration 
selection process and on whose behalf 
a Form I–129 for H–1B petition was 
filed because H–1B petitioners must 
obtain a certified LCA from DOL that 
includes the applicable wage level. An 
LCA is not a requirement for 
registration. Therefore, DHS does not 
have information on the number of 
registrations for each wage level. DHS 
assumes that the H–1B cap-subject 
petition receipts percentages by wage 
levels from LCA data are predictive of 
the H–1B registrations percentages by 
wage levels. However, to the extent that 
proffered wages may exceed the wage 
levels indicated on the LCA, the 
projections in this discussion will 
represent the upper bound of the impact 
of the final rule. DHS does not have a 
way to estimate how many registrants 
will select a higher wage level than 
required on the LCA, so DHS uses LCA 
wage level data as a reasonable proxy 
for registration wage level data. 
DHS uses the percentages of H–1B 
cap-subject petition receipts by wage 
level to estimate the distribution of 
registrations for beneficiaries by wage 
level. Table 12 shows that the 
distribution of current H–1B cap-subject 
petition receipts, 94,900, by wage level 
is 28 percent, 55 percent, 12 percent, 
and 5 percent for wage levels I, II, III, 
and IV, respectively. DHS uses the 5- 
year average of the number of unique 
beneficiaries with eligible registrations, 
320,711 from Table 3 and applies the 
distribution of current H–1B cap-subject 
petition receipts to estimate the number 
of unique beneficiaries with eligible 
registrations by wage level shown in 
Table 12.

DHS recognizes combining the pool of 
beneficiaries for the regular cap and the advanced 
degree exemption would result in a decrease in 
wage level I beneficiaries under the final rule. 
However, modeling the weighted selection as a 
single pooled draw across all registrations is more 
tractable and clarifies the rule’s impact with minor 
loss of accuracy. 
This final rule will change the way 
USCIS selects registrations for H–1B 
cap-subject petitions (or petitions, if the 
registration process is suspended), 
including those eligible for the 
advanced degree exemption. When 
random selection is required, USCIS 
will weight and select unique 
beneficiaries with properly submitted 
registrations generally based on the 
highest OEWS wage level that the 
beneficiary’s proffered wage will equal 
or exceed for the relevant SOC code in 
the area(s) of intended employment. A 
registrant will be required to select the 
box for the highest OEWS wage level 
(‘‘wage level IV,’’ ‘‘wage level III,’’ 
‘‘wage level II,’’ or ‘‘wage level I’’) that 
the proffered wage generally equals or 
exceeds for the relevant SOC code in the 
area of intended employment or 
otherwise select the appropriate box 
according to the form instructions. 
Registrations for unique beneficiaries or 
petitions will be assigned to the relevant 
OEWS wage level and entered into the 
selection pool as follows: registrations 
for unique beneficiaries or petitions 
assigned wage level IV will be entered 
into the selection pool four times, those 
assigned wage level III will be entered 
into the selection pool three times, those 
assigned wage level II will be entered 
into the selection pool two times, and 
those assigned wage level I will be 
entered into the selection pool one time. 
Each unique beneficiary will only be 
counted once toward the numerical 
allocation projections, regardless of how 
many registrations were submitted for 
that beneficiary or how many times the 
beneficiary is entered in the selection 
pool. If a beneficiary has multiple 
registrations, the unique beneficiary will 
be allotted to the lowest wage level of 
all registrations submitted on his or her 
behalf. This rule will increase the odds 
of being selected to file H–1B cap- 
subject petitions for beneficiaries with 
proffered wages that correspond to 
higher wage levels. DHS examines the 
impacts of the change in three different 
dimensions: probability of being 
selected, estimated number of unique 
beneficiaries selected by wage levels, 
and economic impact of the change. 
Under the current H–1B selection 
process, if more registrations for unique 
beneficiaries are submitted than 
projected as needed to reach the 
numerical allocations, USCIS randomly 
selects from among unique beneficiaries 
for whom registrations were properly 
submitted, the number of unique 
beneficiaries projected as needed to 
reach the H–1B numerical allocations. 
Under this random H–1B registration 
selection process, USCIS first selects 
from a pool of all unique beneficiaries, 
including those eligible for the 
advanced degree exemption. USCIS 
then selects from the remaining unique 
beneficiaries a sufficient number 
projected as needed to reach the 
advanced degree exemption. 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(5) through (6). This 
process allows beneficiaries who have 
earned a qualifying U.S. master’s degree 
or higher a greater chance to be selected. 
The final rule will maintain this two- 
stage selection process to keep a higher 
chance of beneficiaries with a qualifying 
U.S. master’s degree or higher of being 
selected. However, for the simplicity of 
comparing the probabilities of being 
selected in the current random selection 
process and in the weighted selection 
process, DHS combines the pool of 
beneficiaries for the regular cap and the 
advanced degree exemption and 
presents the probabilities of being 
selected at different wage levels in this 
analysis.

Table 13 compares the probabilities of 
being selected and corresponding 
estimated petition receipts by wage 
level for the current random selection 
process and new weighted selection 
process. Under the current random 
selection process in which every unique 
beneficiary has an equal chance of being 
selected, the probability of being 
selected to file an H–1B cap-subject 
petition for a unique beneficiary is 29.59 
percent across all the wage levels. 
Under the new weighted selection, DHS

NI A counts in H-1 B cap-subject receipts by wage level were redistributed among wage levels using the percent of total. For example, for wage level II, 28,238 is 26,975, the 5-
year average of non-master's for level II from Table 11, plus 1,264, which is 61 percent of the total NIA 
count, 2,075. The estimated number of beneficiaries with eligible registrations by wage level is estimated using percentages 
by wage level (level I, 28%; level II, 55%; level III, 12%; and level IV, 5%) of the 5-year average 
of the number of beneficiaries with eligible registrations, 320,711. The 5-year annual average of 
number of beneficiaries with eligible registrations, 320,711, is from Table 3. 60948 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations 119
Calculating weighted probability is complex 
due to the involvement of conditional probabilities 
and distributional assumptions. For this analysis, 
DHS uses simple weighted probabilities to 
approximate the expected distribution of each wage 
level in the sample (see Table 13), comparing 
probabilities of being selected. The new weighted 
probability distribution assumes that companies 
will keep their current wage rates when submitting 
registrations or petitions. As a result, the analysis 
may underestimate the number of registrations or 
petitions for higher-wage positions selected in the 
future if companies offer higher wages to improve 
their chance of selection. 
120
Note that the estimated number of H–1B cap- 
subject petitions (94,900) exceeds the number of H– 
1B visas authorized under the statutory cap 
(approximately 85,000, after certain deductions are 
made for certain numerical set-asides) to allow for 
the possibility that some approved workers would 
either not seek a visa or admission, would not be 
issued a visa, or would not be admitted to the 
United States. 
estimates that the probability of being 
selected to file a H–1B cap-subject 
petition for a unique beneficiary will be 
15.29 percent for level I, 30.58 percent 
for level II, 45.87 percent for level III, 
and 61.16 percent for level IV.
119
The 
estimated petition receipts for the 
current selection process and new 
selection process are shown in Table 13. 
DHS estimates that the percentage 
change in probability of being selected 
to file an H–1B cap-subject petition from 
the current to the new process will 
decrease by 48 percent for level I and 
will increase by 3 percent, 55 percent, 
and 107 percent for level II, level III, 
and level IV, respectively. DHS projects, 
based on the weighted selection process, 
that the probability of being selected to 
file an H–1B cap-subject petition will be 
allocated more to levels II, III, and IV, 
and less to level I.

the number of initial H–1B visas, rather 
than the historical 5-year annual average

percent of total petitions. Figure 1 
breaks out the wage levels for these SOC 
codes. The H–1B cap-subject petitions 
by wage level presented in previous 
tables show that most of the petitions 
are at wage level II. As seen in Figure

Mathematical Occupations. Petitions for 
Computer and Mathematical 
Occupations are overwhelmingly at 
wage level II, whereas petitions for

However, it is possible that such prospective 
employers already pay a wage that corresponds to 
a higher wage level such that the chance of 
selection would not be reduced under the final rule, 
or that they would choose to pay a wage that 
corresponds to a higher wage level in order to 
increase the chance of selection for workers in level 
I positions. 
122
This does not mean there are no petitions filed 
at Wage Level I for SOC 15–1299 (Computer 
Occupations, All Other). The figure shows, by wage 
level, the top five six-digit SOC codes within the 
Computer and Mathematical Occupations category. 
SOC 15–1299 does not rank in the top five at Wage 
Level I, but it does at Wage Levels II, III, or IV. 
Given that the analysis estimates a 48 
percent drop in selections for wage level 
I beneficiaries, the distribution of wage 
levels at the SOC code will determine 
the effects of the final rule for 
occupations under that SOC code. DHS 
examines these effects for the top two 
SOC major group codes (15 and 17) by 
breaking out the distribution into 6-digit 
SOC codes. The results are summarized 
in Figure 2 and Figure 3. 
Of the 470,023 H–1B cap-subject 
petitions received in FY 2020–FY 2024, 
69 percent (326,000) were associated 
with SOC major group 15 (Computer 
and Mathematical Occupations). This 
major occupation group contains 460 
distinct 6-digit SOC codes, each 
corresponding to a different detailed 
occupation. Examples of detailed 
occupations include 15–1252 (Software 
Developers) and 15–2051 (Data 
Scientists). The top five detailed 
occupations make up 71 percent of the 
326,000 petitions received under SOC 
major group 15. Figure 2 details the 
counts for these five detailed 
occupations, separated by whether they 
were grouped at wage level I or at one 
of the higher wage levels (II, III, IV). As 
Figure 2 shows, all detailed occupations 
under SOC major group 15 have counts 
of petitions in wage level I and in higher 
wage levels except 15–2041 
(Statistician). 
The final rule does not project a 
significant increase in the selection of 
higher wage level workers in the 15– 
2041 (Statistician) occupation.
121
SOC 
code 15–1299 (Computer Occupations, 
All Other) is also one of the notable 
exceptions—it is not one of the top five 
SOC codes for level I petitions.
122
SOC 
code 15–1299 is used to encompass 
detailed occupations that do not have a 
specific code within the broad group. 
The final rule will have material effects 
on these detailed occupations since 
registrations under this code will 
receive a large boost in probability that 
they are selected.

To the extent that some of these employers 
may already be paying a wage, or offering to pay 
a wage, that corresponds to a higher wage level, or 
may choose to do so, DHS recognizes this projected 
reduction represents the upper bound of estimated 
impact. However, because DHS does not have a way 
to estimate how many registrants would pay a 
proffered wage that corresponds to a higher wage 
level than the wage level required on the LCA, DHS 
uses the wage level selected on the LCA as a proxy 
for the wage level that is likely to be selected on 
the registration.

However, it is possible that such prospective 
employers already pay a wage that corresponds to 
a higher wage level such that the chance of 
selection would not be reduced under the final rule, 
or that they would choose to pay a wage that 
corresponds to a higher wage level in order to 
increase the chance of selection for workers in level 
I positions. 
After SOC major group code 15, the 
major group with the next greatest 
number of petitioners is SOC major 
group code 17 (Architecture and 
Engineering Occupations). This major 
group had 52,402 petitions filed in FY 
2020 through FY 2024. Figure 3 details 
the counts for the top five detailed 
occupations within SOC major group 
code 17 that had the greatest number of 
petitions in FY 2020 through FY 2024. 
As for SOC major group code 17, many 
of these occupations have petition 
counts in wage level I and in higher 
wage levels. SOC code 17–2051 (Civil 
Engineers) and 17–1011 (Architects, 
Except Landscape and Naval) are also a 
notable exception since all the petitions 
under this code in the figure were wage 
level I. The final rule will reduce the 
number of selected H–1B registrations 
for Civil Engineers and Architects by up 
to 48 percent, assuming such 
registrations will be submitted at wage 
level I consistent with historical LCA 
wage level data for Civil Engineers.
123
 
On the other hand, the final rule will 
likely increase the number of selected 
H–1B registrations for SOC code 17– 
2072 (Electronics Engineers except 
Computer), SOC code 17–2131 
(Materials Engineers), and 17–2100 
(Engineers, All Other) since these 
detailed occupations are not top five 
SOC codes for wage level I registrations, 
assuming such registrations will be 
submitted at higher wage levels 
consistent with historical LCA wage 
level data for these occupations.
124

Architecture and Engineering 
Occupations for FY 2020–FY 2024, by 
Wage Level 
Most of the petitions are filed with the 
same top 6-digit SOC codes across wage 
levels, with several exceptions. The 
final rule projects that almost half of the 
registrations for beneficiaries with a 
proffered wage that corresponds to a 
wage level I typically associated with 
entry-level workers will not be selected 
but registrations for beneficiaries with a 
proffered wage that corresponds to a 
higher wage level typically associated 
with more experienced workers will be 
selected in the same occupational 
categories.
125
However, for certain 
occupations that have historically 
included only petitions for level I 
positions, such as Civil Engineers or 
Architects, except Landscape and Naval, 
the final rule does not project a 
significant increase in the selection of 
higher wage level workers in the same 
occupations.
126
Instead, the final rule 
projects increased distribution in 
occupations that have historically 
included petitions for higher wage level 
positions, such as Computer 
Occupations (all other), Electronics 
Engineers (except computer), Materials 
Engineers, or Engineers, All Other 
shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. 
Therefore, DHS expects that the final 
rule will have an impact on the 
occupational distribution of H–1B 
workers. 
A prospective petitioner (employer) 
may respond to the final rule in several 
ways. An employer could choose to 
increase the proffered wage to increase 
the probability of getting its H–1B 
registration selected. If employers 
choose to increase the proffered wage, 
or if employers were already offering a

DHS has not quantified this cost but notes that 
in the analysis accompanying the 2021 final rule, 
DHS ‘‘assume[d] that an entity whose H–1B petition 
is denied will incur an average cost of $4,398 per 
worker (in 2019 dollars) . . . to search for and hire 
a U.S. worker in place of an H–1B worker during 
the period of this economic analysis. If petitioners 
cannot find suitable replacements for the labor H– 
1B cap-subject beneficiaries would have provided if 
selected and, ultimately, granted H–1B status, this 
final rule primarily will be a cost to these 
petitioners through lost productivity and profits.’’ 
86 FR 1676, 1724 (Jan. 8, 2021). 
salary corresponding to a higher wage 
level, then this final rule might result in 
more registrations (or petitions, if 
registration is suspended) with a 
proffered wage that will correspond to 
wage level II, III, or IV, and fewer 
registrations corresponding to wage 
level I. It is also possible that an 
employer may choose not to make any 
changes in response to this rule, 
especially those employers that were 
already offering a salary corresponding 
to a higher wage level. 
Other prospective employers may 
leave the position vacant if the alien 
beneficiary they registered is not 
selected, because they will not be able 
to justify raising the proffered wage to 
an amount that corresponds to a higher 
wage level and that will have improved 
their chance of selection. These 
employers might be unable to fill their 
position(s). And other employers might 
incur additional costs to find available 
replacement workers, such as by seeking 
out and/or training other workers.
127
 
The effects of this rulemaking on any 
given employer will depend in part on 
the interaction of a number of complex 
variables that constantly are in flux, 
including national, state, and local labor 
market conditions, economic and 
business factors, the type of occupations 
and skills involved, and the 
substitutability between H–1B workers 
and U.S. workers. 
DHS acknowledges costs incurred 
associated with loss of output from not 
being able to employ H–1B 
beneficiaries. Costs incurred associated 
with loss of potential output will be 
discussed as a transfer later in this 
section. 
Table 15 shows the annual quantified 
economic impacts of the final rule. To 
estimate the economic impact of the 
final rule, DHS uses the average annual 
salary of H–1B cap-subject workers by 
wage level in FY 2024. In Table 15, the 
average annual salary for wage level I is 
$85,006, for wage level II is $103,071, 
for wage level III is $131,454, and for 
wage level IV is $162,528. The 
estimated total annual salary paid to H– 
1B cap-subject workers under the 
current selection process in FY 2024 
dollars will be $8,862,595,799. 
However, under the weighted selection 
process, the estimated total annual 
salary paid to initial H–1B cap-subject 
workers will increase because there will 
be fewer wage level I workers and more 
wage level II, III, and IV workers. DHS 
estimates that the total annual salaries 
paid to H–1B workers will increase by 
$502,080,486 to $9,364,676,285. The 
$502 million increase is the estimated 
quantifiable economic benefit resulting 
from the final rule in the first year.

BILLING CODE 9111–97–C 
The maximum initial granted period 
of stay for H–1B status is three years, 
with extensions for up to three years 
thereafter. An H–1B worker is generally 
limited to a six-year period of 
authorized stay, unless eligible for an 
exemption from the general 6-year 
period of stay limitation under 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(13)(iii)(D) and (E). Based on a 
DHS analysis of FY2017 through 
FY2019 cohort of initial H–1B cap- 
subject approvals, the average total 
validity period, including extensions, is 
5.2 years among beneficiaries whose 
extension basis for classification is 
‘‘Continuation of previously approved 
employment without change with the 
same employer.’’
128
DHS recognizes 
that H–1B extensions vary across 
petitions and workers. For the purpose 
of this analysis, DHS believes it is 
appropriate to assume the average H–1B 
cap-subject worker’s duration of H–1B 
status is 5 years to estimate the benefits 
and transfers of the final rule. 
The estimated economic benefits in 
the first year when the new registration 
selection process is in effect are 
approximately $502 million. Assuming 
H–1B cap-subject workers work an 
average of five years in the United 
States, these benefits will accrue for four 
additional years. The benefits in the 
second year will be about $1,004 
million, which includes the initial $502 
million in benefits accrued from new H– 
1B cap-subject workers with higher 
wages in the first year plus an estimated 
$502 million in benefits accrued from 
new H–1B cap-subject workers in the 
second year. Similarly, the benefits in 
years 3 and 4 are $1,506 million and 
$2,008 million, respectively, reflecting 
granted H–1B cap-subject workers

granted in the current year and the prior 
two years (year 3) and in the current 
year and the prior three years (year 4). 
From year 5 onward, accrued five-year 
benefits are $2,510 million each year. 
In addition to the $502 million in 
first-year benefits discussed previously, 
the $9.4 billion in first-year H–1B wages 
resulting from the final rule also 
contains a transfer from wage level I 
workers to wage level II, III, and IV 
workers. When a regulation generates a 
gain for one group and an equal-dollar- 
value loss for another group, the 
regulation is said to cause a transfer 
from the latter group to the former.
129
 
When H–1B allocations change from 
wage level I workers to higher wage 
level workers, the benefits of the H–1B 
classification are transferred from wage 
level I workers to higher wage level 
workers. For example, if a wage level IV 
worker whose annual salary is $160,000 
is selected instead of a wage level I 
worker whose annual salary is $85,000, 
then $85,000 of benefits are transferred 
from the wage level I worker to the wage 
level IV worker (the difference of 
$75,000 is a benefit to the level IV 
worker). DHS estimates that transfers 
from wage level I workers to other wage 
level workers will be $858 million in 
the first year under the final rule. 
Assuming H–1B cap-subject workers 
work an average of five years in H–1B 
nonimmigrant status, transfers will also 
accrue for four additional years. The 
transfers in the second year will be 
approximately $1,717 million and in 
years 3 and 4 the transfers will be about 
$2,575 million and $3,434 million, 
respectively. In years 5 and beyond, the 
transfers will be approximately $4,292 
million. These transfers are the costs 
incurred associated with loss of output 
from not being able to employ the labor 
of wage level I H–1B workers for the 
employers who registered H–1B workers 
at wage level I. Whereas the transfers are 
a benefit to the employers who 
registered H–1B workers at higher wage 
levels because they will expect gains in 
output by being able to employ H–1B 
workers. To the extent that benefits and 
transfers are estimated using LCA data, 
and proffered wages may exceed the 
wage levels indicated on the LCA, the 
projections in this discussion will 
represent the upper bound of the impact 
of the final rule. 
There is an unquantifiable transfer 
from the employers who will lose an 
opportunity to employ wage level I H– 
1B workers to the employers who will 
gain an opportunity to employ higher 
wage level workers in terms of output 
produced. When an employer gets into 
an economic activity of hiring workers 
and producing output, they will expect 
the output to at least recover the labor 
cost of hiring workers. DHS is not able 
to quantify this producer surplus. 
According to this analysis, half of the 
employers who hire H–1B workers at 
wage level I will lose the opportunity to 
gain the surplus under the final rule. 
This gained surplus will be transferred 
to the employers who will have an 
opportunity to hire workers at higher 
wage levels. 
By engaging in a wage-level-based 
weighting of registrations for unique 
beneficiaries, DHS will increase the 
chances that initial H–1B visas and 
status grants will go to higher-skilled or 
higher-paid beneficiaries. Facilitating 
the admission of higher-skilled workers 
‘‘will benefit the economy and increase 
the United States’ competitive edge in 
attracting the ‘best and the brightest’ in 
the global labor market,’’

consistent 
with the goals of the H–1B program. 
c. Required Information on Petition 
Unless registration is suspended, a 
petitioner may file an H–1B petition for 
a beneficiary who may be counted 
under section 214(g)(1)(A) of the Act, or 
eligible for exemption under section 
214(g)(5)(C) of the Act, only if the 
petition is based on a valid selected 
registration. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(1). An H–1B cap- 
subject petition filed on behalf of a 
beneficiary will be required to contain 
and be supported by the same 
identifying information and position 
information, including SOC code, 
provided in the selected registration. 
See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(1). Such petition will be required to 
include a proffered wage that equals or 
exceeds the prevailing wage for the 
corresponding OEWS wage level in the 
registration for the SOC code in the 
area(s) of intended employment as 
indicated on the LCA used to support 
the petition. Id. Petitioners will be required to submit evidence of the basis 
of the wage level selected on the 
registration as of the date that the 
registration underlying the petition was 
submitted. Id. This change will add additional 
questions for petitioners for both the 
Form I–129 and the H–1B and H–1B1 
Data Collection and Filing Fee 
Exemption Supplement (paper and 
online e-file). DHS estimates that these 
additional questions will increase the 
time burden by 15 minutes for each 
petition (0.25 hours) for all H–1B 
petitions, not just H–1B cap-subject 
petitions, because these questions will 
be on the forms completed and 
submitted by all H–1B petitioners. The 
change will offer qualitative benefits. 
Specifically, submission of additional 
information on the petition form 
(including wage level information and 
the SOC code), and evidence of the basis 
of the wage level selected will allow 
USCIS to further improve the integrity 
of the H–1B cap selection and 
adjudication processes. 
Based on a 5-year annual average, 
between FY 2020 and FY 2024 from 
Table 16, DHS estimates the annual 
average H–1B petition receipts are 
422,759. The 5-year annual average of 
Form I–129 H–1B receipts with Form G– 
28 is 336,023.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260955 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations DHS does not know the exact number 
of petitioners who will choose an in- 
house or an outsourced lawyer but 
assumes it may be a 50/50 split and 
therefore provides an average. Table 17 
shows the additional annual average 
cost for a lawyer to complete the 
petition on behalf of a petitioner. The 
additional opportunity cost of time for 
completing and submitting an H–1B 
petition using an attorney or other 
representative is estimated to range from 
$10,334,387 to $17,817,620 with an 
average of $14,076,004. 
To estimate the current remaining 
opportunity cost of time for an HR 
specialist submitting an H–1B petition 
without a lawyer, DHS applies the 
estimated increased public reporting 
time burden 15 minutes (0.25 hours) to 
the compensation rate of an HR 
specialist. Table 18 estimates the 
current total annual opportunity cost of 
time to HR specialists completing and 
submitting an H–1B petition will be 
approximately $1,149,903.

annual cost for attorneys and HR 
specialists to complete and submit an 
H–1B petition will be $15,225,907 as 
shown in Table 19. 
d. Process Integrity 
DHS is revising 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(ii) 
to clarify that a valid registration must 
represent a bona fide job offer. The final 
rule will also require an H–1B petition 
filed after registration selection to 
contain and be supported by the same 
identifying information and position 
information, including SOC code, 
provided in the selected registration and 
indicated on the LCA used to support 
the petition. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(D)(1). Such petition must 
also include a proffered wage that 
equals or exceeds the prevailing wage 
for the corresponding OEWS wage level 
in the registration for the SOC code in 
the area(s) of intended employment as 
described in 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(8)(iii)(A)(4)(i). Id. The final rule will allow USCIS to 
deny a subsequent new or amended 
petition filed by the petitioner, or a 
related entity, on behalf of the same 
beneficiary if USCIS were to determine 
that the filing of the new or amended 
petition was part of the petitioner’s 
attempt to unfairly increase the odds of 
selection during the registration (or 
petition, if applicable) selection process, 
such as by reducing the proffered wage 
to an amount that will be equivalent to 
a lower wage level than that indicated 
on the original registration or petition. 
See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iii). In this context, attempting to ‘‘unfairly increase 
the odds of selection’’ generally refers to 
attempting to derive the benefit from the 
increased chance of selection associated 
with a higher corresponding wage level 
without having a bona fide job offer at 
the corresponding wage level attested to 
during registration. Additionally, a new 
or amended petition containing a 
proffered wage equivalent to a lower 
wage level than that indicated on the 
original registration or petition may 
reveal an attempt to ‘‘unfairly increase 
the odds of selection’’ or indicate that 
the registration or petition did not in 
fact represent a bona fide job offer, 
which will violate the requirement that 
a valid registration represents a bona 
fide job offer. 
As is currently required, the entity 
submitting a registration or petition will 
be required to certify the veracity of the 
contents of such submissions. DHS 
estimates that the final rule could lead 
to an increase in the number of denials 
or revocations of H–1B petitions. DHS 
cannot quantify this impact. The 
changes in process integrity will lead to 
improved program integrity for USCIS. 
5. Alternatives Considered 
DHS considered proposing the 
methodology from the 2020 H–1B 
Selection NPRM (85 FR 69236 (Nov. 2, 
2020)) and the 2021 H–1B Selection 
Final Rule (86 FR 1676 (Jan. 8, 2021)). 
Under the 2021 H–1B Selection Final 
Rule, USCIS would have ranked and 
selected registrations generally based on 
the highest prevailing wage level that 
the proffered wage equals or exceeds for 
the relevant SOC code and area(s) of 
intended employment. The rule was 
expected to result in the likelihood that 
registrations for level I wages would not 
be selected, as well as a reduced 
likelihood that registrations for level II 
would be selected. As discussed earlier 
in this preamble, DHS believes the 
selection process finalized under the 
2021 H–1B Selection Final Rule was a 
reasonable approach to facilitate the 
admission of higher-skilled or higher- 
paid workers. However, DHS believes 
that rule did not capture the optimal 
approach because it effectively left little 
or no opportunity for the selection of 
lower wage level or entry level workers, 
some of whom may still be highly 
skilled. DHS also considered various 
alternatives suggested by commenters, 
such as weighted selection by various 
factors (occupational preferences, 
industry preferences, preferences for 
certain educational degrees, etc.), but 
declined to adopt those suggested 
alternatives for the reasons previously 
explained in the comment responses.

Accordingly, DHS is instead finalizing

that initial H–1B visas and status grants 
would more likely go to the highest 
skilled or highest paid beneficiaries, 
while not effectively precluding those at 
lower wage levels. 
6. Total Quantified Costs, Benefits, and 
Transfers of Regulatory Changes 
In this section, DHS presents the total 
annual costs, benefits, and transfers 
annualized over a 10-year period of 
analysis. DHS summarizes the annual 
costs, benefits, and transfers 
(undiscounted) of this final rule in 
Table 20. DHS estimates the total annual 
cost will be $30,362,120 for FY 2026 
through FY 2035. In Table 20, DHS 
estimates the total annual benefit will be 
$502,080,486 in FY2026, $1,004,160,972 
in FY2027, $1,506,241,458 in FY2028, 
$2,008,321,944 in FY2029, and 
$2,510,402,430 in each year from 
FY2030 through FY2035. DHS estimates 
annual transfers (undiscounted) will be 
$858,470,298 in FY2026, $1,716,940,595 
in FY2027, $2,575,410,893 in FY2028, 
$3,433,881,191 in FY2029, and 
$4,292,351,489 in each year from 
FY2030 through FY2035. The net 
benefit will be calculated by subtracting 
the cost from the benefit each year. 10- 
Year undiscounted total net benefits to 
the public of $19,779,598,238 are the 
total benefits minus total costs.

In Aeronautical Repair Station Association, Inc. v. FAA, the D.C. Circuit made clear that an entity is not ‘‘subject to’’ a regulation unless the regulation 
‘‘imposes responsibilities directly on’’ the entity. 
494 F.3d 161, 177 (D.C. Cir. 2007); see also Mid- 
Tex Elec. Coop., Inc. v. FERC, 773 F.2d 327, 342 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (holding that the RFA’s 
requirements apply only to ‘‘small entities that 
would be directly regulated’’ by a challenged rule). 
7. Costs to the Federal Government 
DHS is revising the regulations 
governing the selection of registrations 
for unique beneficiaries submitted by 
prospective petitioners (also referred to 
as registrants) seeking to file H–1B cap- 
subject petitions (or the selection of 
petitions, if the registration process 
were suspended). This final rule will 
require updates to USCIS IT systems 
and additional time spent by USCIS to 
review newly required information 
during the adjudication of the petition 
and maintain program integrity. 
The INA provides for the collection of 
fees at a level that will ensure recovery 
of the full costs of providing 
adjudication and naturalization services 
by DHS, including administrative costs 
and services provided without charge to 
certain applicants and petitioners.
132
 
DHS establishes USCIS fees according to 
the estimated cost of adjudication based 
on its relative adjudication burden and 
use of USCIS resources. Fees are 
established at an amount that is 
necessary to recover these assigned 
costs, such as clerical, officer, and 
managerial salaries and benefits, plus an 
amount to recover unassigned overhead 
(e.g., facility rent, IT equipment and systems) and immigration benefits 
provided without a fee charge. These 
costs will be captured in the fees 
collected for the benefit request from 
petitioners. DHS established the current 
fee for H–1B registrations and petitions 
in its FY2024 fee rule based on 
empirical cost estimates. DHS notes that 
if the final rule increases USCIS’ costs, 
then the fee schedule adjustment will be 
determined at USCIS’ next 
comprehensive biennial fee review. 
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 
(RFA), Public Law 96–354, as amended 
by the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, 
Public Law 104–121, 5 U.S.C. 601 
through 612, requires Federal agencies 
to consider the potential impact of 
regulations on small businesses, small 
governmental jurisdictions, and small 
organizations during the development of 
their rules. The term ‘‘small entities’’ 
comprises small businesses, not-for- 
profit organizations that are 
independently owned and operated and 
are not dominant in their fields, and 
governmental jurisdictions with 
populations of less than 50,000.
133
An 
‘‘individual’’ is not considered a small 
entity and costs to an individual are not 
considered a small entity impact for 
RFA purposes. In addition, the courts 
have held that the RFA requires an 
agency to perform a regulatory 
flexibility analysis of small entity 
impacts only when a rule directly 
regulates small entities.
134
 
Consequently, indirect impacts from a 
rule on a small entity are not considered 
as costs for RFA purposes. The Final 
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for this 
final rule focuses on the population of 
employers who submit H–1B petitions 
(Form I–129, Petition for a 
Nonimmigrant Worker) and H–1B 
registrations. 
DHS believes that the changes in this 
final rule will have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities that file H–1B 
cap-subject petitions.

The commenter referenced ‘‘partial weighting’’ 
whereby minimally acceptable weights might apply 
to only a portion of locations or occupations to 
correct for differences within specific subgroups, 
whereas ‘‘steep weighting’’ refers to assigning 
relatively larger weights to correct for overall 
differences. 
1. Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
a. A Statement of Need for, and 
Objectives of, This Final Rule 
DHS’s objectives and legal authority 
for this final rule are discussed earlier 
in the preamble. DHS is amending its 
regulations governing H–1B specialty 
occupation workers. The purpose of the 
changes is to better ensure that initial 
H–1B visas or grants of status are more 
likely to be awarded to petitioners 
seeking to employ higher-paid and 
higher-skilled beneficiaries, while not 
effectively precluding those at lower 
wage levels. DHS believes these changes 
will disincentivize use of the H–1B 
program to fill relatively lower paid, 
lower skilled positions, better aligning 
the H–1B program with congressional 
intent. 
b. A Statement of Significant Issues 
Raised by the Public Comments in 
Response to the Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis, a Statement of 
Assessment of Any Changes Made in the 
Proposed Rule as a Result of Such 
Comments 
Comment: Some commenters stated that the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
(RFA) conducted by DHS is both flawed 
and incomplete and makes it difficult to 
assess the rule’s effects. Some 
commenters stated that while DHS 
acknowledged that a substantial 
majority of H–1B petitioning entities are 
small businesses and that a significant 
portion would be economically affected, 
the analysis does not examine the 
distributional effects across industry 
sectors, geographic regions, and 
business models reliant on entry- or 
mid-level professional workers. 
Furthermore, the commenters stated 
that the analysis did not adequately 
quantify the magnitude and scope of 
these impacts, nor did it present 
alternative frameworks as required by 
statute. Another commenter stated that 
the IRFA failed to adequately quantify 
the impact on small entities in terms of 
lost growth opportunities, higher 
recruitment and training costs, and 
increased turnover for small businesses. 
Further, another commenter stated 
that despite acknowledging the negative 
impacts for small businesses, DHS did 
not propose exemptions, transitional 
relief, or offsetting mechanisms that 5 
U.S.C. 603 requires for small entities. 
Some commenters recommended what 
analyses would be needed to ensure a 
rigorous cost-benefit analysis. A 
commenter stated that the analysis 
should incorporate empirical data by 
industry and firm size, model 
cumulative costs and opportunity 
losses, and explicitly consider flexible 
approaches that preserve program 
integrity while mitigating 
disproportionate harm to small U.S. 
employers. Another commenter stated 
that DHS should ‘‘prepare a 
supplemental regulatory analysis under 
E.O. 12866 and OMB Circular A–4 that: 
(a) quantifies the distributional effects 
and transfers produced by weighting 
across firm sizes, regions, and 
occupations; (b) rigorously evaluates 
reasonable alternatives (including 
keeping a beneficiary-centric random 
selection, partial weighting, geographic/ 
occupation-adjusted weighting, and 
small-entity safeguards); and (c) 
explains why the chosen approach best 
meets the stated objectives at least cost.’’ 
Furthermore, the commenter suggested 
the need for an IRFA, including a robust 
analysis of significant alternatives to 
minimize small entity impacts. Finally, 
a commenter stated that the DHS 
analysis should have accounted for 
other major costs, such as reduced 
competitiveness for U.S. businesses in 
terms of lost market share and 
innovation, weakened research 
institutions, the strategic advantage 
gained by competitor nations that attract 
the excluded talent, inefficiencies from 
wage inflation, barriers to 
entrepreneurship for small businesses, 
and reduced innovation and business 
formation. 
Response: DHS relied on the best available empirical data and analyzed 
potential effects on small entities and 
industries through the RIA and the 
IRFA. In these analyses, DHS quantified 
a projected decrease of 10,099 level I 
workers under the new selection system 
and found that 61 percent of petitions 
filed by small entities were at wage level 
I. DHS estimated the value of lost output 
using the average wage of affected 
workers ($85,006) and discussed 
additional costs to identify or train 
replacement workers (estimated at 
$4,398). 
The RIA quantifies transfers and 
evaluates distributional effects across 
SOC codes, and the IRFA presents 
impacts by firm size. With respect to 
geography, the weighted selection 
process generally relies on prevailing 
wage levels by occupation and 5. area of 
intended employment, which 
normalizes for local labor markets and 
mitigates any systematic advantage for 
higher-cost regions. 
DHS considered reasonable 
alternatives against the rule’s 
objectives—increasing the chance of 
selection for higher-paid, higher skilled 
aliens while maintaining program 
integrity and administrative efficiency— 
and explained why other options were 
not adopted (see 5. Alternatives 
Considered). Retaining a purely random 
selection process (with or without 
additional anti-fraud measures) does not 
advance the policy allocation objective 
and preserves incentives for mass 
registration at lower wage levels. Anti- 
fraud tools are complementary to, not 
substitutes for, an allocation 
mechanism. Partial weighting does not 
materially improve the status quo, while 
very steep weighting would overly favor 
high-wage cases and likely crowd out 
lower wage levels entirely.
135
 
Geographic- or occupation-adjusted 
weighting is unnecessary because the 
weighted selection process 
implemented by this final rule will 
normalize by local labor markets via 
prevailing wage levels for the 
occupation and area of intended 
employment. Adding explicit regional 
or occupational carveouts would 
introduce unnecessary complexity, 
subjectivity, and greater susceptibility to 
gaming. Any alternative that provides 
preferential weighting—including for 
small entities—would undermine the 
rule’s objective to efficiently and 
effectively administer a cap selection 
process that generally favors allocation 
to higher-skilled and higher-paid 
workers across industries, occupations, 
and geographic areas. 
DHS acknowledges that the rule is 
likely to have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. Under the new rule, employers 
or industries with higher share of wage 
level III or IV may see improved 
selection outcomes. In contrast, those 
with a higher share of wage level I may 
experience lower relative selection 
outcomes. However, DHS does not 
believe it would be fair, effective, and 
administratively efficient or practical 
within the H–1B cap selection process 
to create carveouts for specific 
employers, industries, or occupations. 
Accordingly, DHS is finalizing the 
weighted cap selection process as 
proposed to ensure that all employers— 
including small entities and those in 
essential occupations—retain 
meaningful opportunities for selection. 
DHS appreciates the commenter’s 
concerns regarding the potential 
negative impact U.S. competitiveness, 
innovation, research, entrepreneurship, 
and business growth on small 
businesses and their role in creating 
barriers to small business 
entrepreneurship. However, the RFA

indirect or secondary effects, such as 
broader economic impacts or 
downstream consequences on the 
economy as a whole. The IRFA and 
Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
(FRFA) prepared for this rule focus on 
the direct economic impacts on small 
entities that are subject to the proposed 
selection process. While DHS recognizes 
the importance of small businesses to 
the U.S. economy and innovation, the 
broader economic considerations raised 
by the commenter are not part of the 
RFA’s requirements. 
Comment: Some commenters expressed concerns associated with the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act portion of the 
proposed rule since the proposed 
weighted selection process would 
significantly disadvantage small 
entities. A commenter referenced DHS 
data that stated that 44 percent of cap- 
subject petitions filed by small entities 
fall within the level I wage category, 
while only 3 percent are at level IV; in 
contrast, larger entities have a lower 
proportion at level I (25 percent) and a 
higher proportion at level IV (6 percent). 
This disparity means the proposed 
process has an outsized, negative impact 
on small entities and rural regions, 
reducing their ability to secure skilled 
workers through the H–1B program. 
Another commenter referenced DHS 
data that showed that 76 percent of H– 
1B petitioners are small business 
owners, and text in the preamble that 
stated that ‘‘2,665 small businesses 
would experience a cost increase that is 
greater than 5 percent of its revenue[,]’’ 
and that ‘‘5,193 small entities would 
experience a cost increase that is greater 
than 1 percent of its revenue.’’ Another 
commenter referenced additional data 
related to the fact that small entities are 
much more likely to submit H–1B 
petitions at lower wage levels (levels I 
and II) compared to larger firms; citing 
that 61 percent of wage level I petitions 
in FY2024 came from small businesses, 
compared to 47 percent for all cap- 
subject petitions. Under the proposed 
rule, the share of H–1B visas awarded to 
small businesses would fall from almost 
68 percent in recent years to 65 percent, 
which would have a negative impact on 
small businesses and the 
competitiveness of the U.S. economy 
overall. 
Response: DHS acknowledges the commenters’ concern regarding impacts 
on small entities. However, any 
alternative process that provides a 
different, preferential weighting scheme 
especially for small entities would 
undermine the overall utility of this 
rule, which is to generally favor the 
allocation of H–1B visas to higher- 
skilled and higher-paid aliens. This rule 
will benefit those small entities that are 
applying for relatively higher-wage 
employees, as they will have a greater 
chance of their employees being 
selected compared to the current 
random selection process. If a small- 
sized entity is unable to pay a 
beneficiary a wage that corresponds to 
a higher wage level for a greater chance 
of selection, they could try to find a 
substitute U.S. worker. DHS selected a 
nationally consistent approach that 
advances program integrity and 
administrability while ensuring all 
employers, including small entities and 
those in rural regions, retain meaningful 
opportunities for selection under the 
same criteria.

Administration in Response to the Rule,

d. A Description of and an Estimate of 
the Number of Small Entities to Which 
This Final Rule Will Apply or an 
Explanation of Why No Such Estimate 
Is Available 
For this analysis, DHS used internal 
data for employers filing H–1B cap- 
subject petitions for FY 2024 merged 
with LCA data.
136
DHS merged the 
internal employer data with the U.S. 
Small Business Administration (SBA)’s 
table of size standards
137
to identify 
small entities and with LCA data
138
to 
identify wage levels for the petitions. 
To determine whether an entity is 
small for purposes of the RFA, DHS first 
identified the entity’s NAICS code and 
then used SBA guidelines to classify the 
revenue or employee count threshold 
for each entity. Some entities were 
classified as small based on their annual 
revenue, and some by their number of 
employees. Approximately 20 percent of 
petitions were not matched using SBA’s 
table of size standards. These 
unmatched employers were considered 
small entities if their number of 
employees was less than 500. 
Using FY 2024 internal data on actual 
filings of H–1B cap-subject petitions, 
there were 94,873 petitions filed. DHS 
recognized 23,452 unique entities and 
was able to classify 22,453 as either 
small entities or not small entities. DHS 
determined that 76 percent of the total 
22,453 unique entities that filed Form I– 
129 under the H–1B classification and 
cap-subject were small entities. See 
Table 22. The estimated annual number 
of small entities impacted by this final 
rule is 17,069.

NAICS codes three are related to the 
computer industry, and two are related 
to manufacturing. The remaining five

Table 24 shows the number of H–1B 
cap-subject petitions filed by small 
entities for FY 2024 by wage level. Out 
of 94,873 H–1B petitions filed, DHS was 
able to classify the petitioners of 82,204 
H–1B petitions as either small entities 
or not small entities and identify the 
number of petitions filed by such 
petitioners by wage level, as well as the 
percentage of petitions filed at each 
wage level by small entities. As shown 
in Table 24, more small entities filed 
petitions at wage levels I and II (61 
percent and 47 percent) than at wage 
levels III and IV (25 percent and 29 
percent). 
BILLING CODE 9111–97–C 
The quantifiable economic impact, 
represented as a percentage, for each 
small entity is the total quantified costs 
of the changes divided by the entity’s 
sales revenue. There are two sources of 
quantifiable costs. One is the 
opportunity cost of time to submit H–1B 
registrations or to file H–1B petitions, or 
both. This cost is relatively small, so it 
is not considered in this analysis. The 
other cost is the loss of output for 
employers who registered with wage 
level I but are not selected due to the 
change in the selection process by the 
final rule and thus are unable to file an 
H–1B petition. DHS estimates the loss of 
output as a transfer, $858,470,298, from 
the lost wages of wage level I workers 
to those higher wage level workers. The 
loss of output from the loss of labor is 
considered as a cost to employers 
because less output means less profit. 
The loss of output from the loss of labor 
is estimated using the wage of the lost 
labor, which is the wage level I average 
annual salary, $85,006 (Table 15). 
Therefore, DHS projects in the final rule 
that some small entities who filed H–1B 
petitions at wage level I will incur costs 
of approximately $85,006.
139
This 
assumes, solely for purposes of the RFA, 
that the employer will be unable to 
otherwise fill the position or perform 
the work. Internal data show that there

DHS divides $85,006 by the revenue 
for each entity then finds that 5,193 
small entities will experience a cost 
increase that is greater than 1 percent of 
its revenue and 2,665 will experience a 
cost increase that is greater than 5 
percent of its revenue.
141
DHS considers 
an impact greater than 1 percent of a 
small entity’s revenue as significant for 
purposes of the RFA. As such, DHS 
estimates that the final rule will result 
in a significant impact on 5,193 small 
entities, or 30 percent of the 17,069 
small entities affected by the final rule. 
DHS considers 30 percent as a 
substantial number. This final rule will 
also benefit small entities that are 
applying for higher-earning employees 
as they will have a greater chance of 
their employees being selected 
compared to the current purely random 
selection process. 
Based on this analysis, DHS believes 
that the changes in this final rule will 
have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities 
that file H–1B cap-subject petitions.

Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other 
Compliance Requirements of the Final 
Rule, Including an Estimate of the 
Classes of Small Entities That Will Be 
Subject to the Requirement and the 
Types of Professional Skills Necessary 
for Preparation of the Report or Record 
The selection process in the final rule 
will result in an additional burden to 
employers reporting additional 
information, including a beneficiary’s 
appropriate wage level, SOC code, and 
area of intended employment in the 
registration system, on the Form I–129 
petition, and on the H–1B and H–1B1 
Data Collection and Filing Fee 
Exemption Supplement to Form I–129. 
DHS estimates the increased burden to 
submit an H–1B registration is 20 
minutes and the increased burden to file 
the Form I–129, Petition for 
Nonimmigrant Worker, to request H–1B 
classification is 15 minutes. DHS 
believes this will be completed by an 
HR specialist, in-house lawyer, or 
outsourced lawyer. 
f. Description of the Steps the Agency 
Has Taken To Minimize the Significant 
Economic Impact on Small Entities 
Consistent With the Stated Objectives of 
the Applicable Statues, Including a 
Statement of Factual, Policy, and Legal 
Reasons for Selecting the Alternative 
Adopted in the Final Rule and Why 
Each One of the Other Significant 
Alternatives to the Rule Considered by 
the Agency Which Affect the Impact on 
Small Entities Was Rejected 
DHS considered alternative solutions 
that are described in further detail in the 
section on Executive Orders 12866 and 
13563 earlier in the preamble of this 
rule, as well as in the comment 
summaries and responses. While the 
collection of additional information and 
the change to a weighted selection 
process will impose a burden on some 
prospective small employers, USCIS 
found no other alternatives that 
achieved the stated objectives with less 
burden to small entities. 
Under the 2021 H–1B Selection Final 
Rule, USCIS would have ranked and 
selected registrations generally based on 
the highest prevailing wage level. The 
rule was expected to result in the 
likelihood that registrations for level I 
wages would not be selected, as well as 
a reduced likelihood that registrations 
for level II would be selected. Compared 
to this final rule, DHS believes that the 
2021 H–1B Selection Final Rule 
approach would have an even greater 
negative effect on small businesses 
hiring lower wage level or entry level 
workers. 
As stated earlier in this analysis, this 
final rule will also benefit small entities 
that are applying for higher-earning 
employees who will be weighted at 
level III or level IV as they will have a 
greater chance of their employees being 
selected compared to the current 
random selection process. Thus, it is 
possible that any alternative that 
imposes a lower burden on small 
entities generally could also reduce 
those employers’ chance of selection for 
higher wage level workers. For example, 
if USCIS were to artificially elevate the 
corresponding wage level for small 
businesses compared to other 
businesses, such an alternative could 
actually decrease the likelihood that 
those small entities’ registrations with a 
level IV wage will be selected, relative 
to the selection process under the final 
rule, if other small businesses are 
artificially elevated to level IV 
equivalency based on factors other than 
the corresponding wage amount. 
Furthermore, given that 76 percent of 
unique cap-subject H–1B filers are small 
entities, and 47 percent of H–1B cap 
petitions in FY 2024 were filed by small 
entities, any alternative process that 
provides a different, preferential 
weighting scheme especially for small 
entities would undermine the overall 
utility of this final rule, which is to 
generally favor the allocation of H–1B 
visas to higher-skilled and higher-paid 
aliens. 
C. Congressional Review Act 
The Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs has determined that 
this final rule is a major rule, as defined 
in 5 U.S.C. 804, also known as the 
‘‘Congressional Review Act’’ (CRA), as 
enacted in section 251 of the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996, Public Law 104– 
121, sec. 251, 110 Stat. 868, 873, and 
codified at 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq. 
Therefore, the rule requires at least a 60- 
day delayed effective date. DHS has 
complied with the CRA’s reporting 
requirements and has sent this final rule 
to Congress and to the Comptroller 
General as required by 5 U.S.C. 
801(a)(1). 
D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 
1995 
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
of 1995 (UMRA) is intended, among 
other things, to curb the practice of 
imposing unfunded Federal mandates 
on State, local, and Tribal governments. 
Title II of UMRA requires each Federal 
agency to prepare a written statement 
assessing the effects of any Federal 
mandate in a final rule that includes any 
Federal mandate that may result in a 
$100 million or more expenditure 
(adjusted annually for inflation) in any 
one year by State, local, and Tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector. See 2 U.S.C. 1532(a). The inflation adjusted value of $100 
million in 1995 is approximately $206 
million in 2024 based on the Consumer 
Price Index for All Urban Consumers 
(CPI–U).

The term ‘‘Federal mandate’’ means a Federal 
intergovernmental mandate or a Federal private 
sector mandate. See 2 U.S.C. 1502(1) and 658(6). 144

DHS’s procedures for implementing NEPA, was

of respondents. For PRA purposes, DHS uses the 
currently approved volume for OMB Control 
number 1615–0144 of 20,950. See https://

contain a Federal mandate as the term 
is defined under UMRA.
143
The 
requirements of title II of UMRA, 
therefore, do not apply, and DHS has 
not prepared a statement under UMRA. 
E. Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) 
This final rule will not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, 
on the relationship between the 
National Government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 6 of Executive 
Order 13132, it is determined that this 
final rule does not have sufficient 
federalism implications to warrant the 
preparation of a federalism summary 
impact statement. 
F. Executive Order 12988 (Civil Justice 
Reform) 
This final rule was drafted and 
reviewed in accordance with E.O. 
12988, Civil Justice Reform. This final 
rule was written to provide a clear legal 
standard for affected conduct and was 
carefully reviewed to eliminate drafting 
errors and ambiguities, so as to 
minimize litigation and undue burden 
on the Federal court system. DHS has 
determined that this final rule meets the 
applicable standards provided in 
section 3 of E.O. 12988. 
G. Executive Order 13175 (Consultation 
and Coordination With Indian Tribal 
Governments) 
This final rule does not have ‘‘tribal 
implications’’ because it will not have 
substantial direct effects on one or more 
Indian Tribes, on the relationship 
between the Federal Government and 
Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of 
power and responsibilities between the 
Federal Government and Indian Tribes. 
Accordingly, E.O. 13175, Consultation 
and Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments, requires no further 
agency action or analysis. 
H. National Environmental Policy Act 
DHS and its components analyze 
regulatory actions to determine whether 
the National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., applies 
to them and, if so, what degree of 
analysis is required. DHS Directive 023– 
01 Rev. 01 ‘‘Implementing the National 
Environmental Policy Act’’ (Dir. 023–01 
Rev. 01) and Instruction Manual 023– 
01–001–01 Rev. 01 (Instruction 
Manual)
144
establish the policies and 
procedures that DHS and its 
components use to comply with NEPA. 
NEPA allows Federal agencies to 
establish, in their NEPA implementing 
procedures, categories of actions 
(‘‘categorical exclusions’’) that 
experience has shown do not, 
individually or cumulatively, have a 
significant effect on the human 
environment and, therefore, do not 
require an environmental assessment or 
environmental impact statement. See 42 U.S.C. 4336(a)(2), 4336e(1). The 
Instruction Manual, Appendix A lists 
the DHS Categorical Exclusions.
145
 
Under DHS NEPA implementing 
procedures, for an action to be 
categorically excluded, it must satisfy 
each of the following three conditions: 
(1) the entire action clearly fits within 
one or more of the categorical 
exclusions; (2) the action is not a piece 
of a larger action; and (3) no 
extraordinary circumstances exist that 
create the potential for a significant 
environmental effect.
146
 
This final rule is limited to amending 
DHS’s existing regulations at 8 CFR 
214.2(h)(8), (10), and (11) to provide for 
the selection of unique beneficiaries 
toward the H–1B annual numerical 
limitations and the advanced degree 
exemption in a weighted manner based 
on the wage level listed in each H–1B 
registration that corresponds to the 
prospective petitioner’s proffered wage. 
DHS has reviewed this final rule and 
finds that no significant impact on the 
environment, or any change in 
environmental effect, will result from 
the amendments being promulgated in 
this final rule. 
Accordingly, DHS finds that the 
promulgation of this final rule’s 
amendments to current regulations 
clearly fits within categorical exclusion 
A3 established in DHS’s NEPA 
implementing procedures as an 
administrative change with no change 
in environmental effect, is not part of a 
larger Federal action, and does not 
present extraordinary circumstances 
that create the potential for a significant 
environmental effect.

(3) Initial registration period. The annual initial registration period will 
last a minimum of 14 calendar days and 
will start at least 14 calendar days 
before the earliest date on which H–1B 
cap-subject petitions may be filed for a 
particular fiscal year, consistent with 
paragraph (h)(2)(i)(J) of this section. 
USCIS will announce the start and end 
dates of the initial registration period on 
the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov for each fiscal year. USCIS will announce 
the start of the initial registration period 
at least 30 calendar days in advance of 
such date. 
(4) Selecting registrations based on unique beneficiaries. Registrations will 
be counted based on the number of 
unique beneficiaries who are registered. 
The selection will be made via 
computer-generated selection based on 
unique beneficiary. Each unique 
beneficiary will only be counted once 
toward the numerical allocation 
projections, regardless of how many 
registrations were submitted for that 
beneficiary or how many times the 
beneficiary is entered in the selection 
pool as provided in paragraph 
(h)(8)(iii)(A)(4)(ii) of this section. USCIS 
will separately notify each registrant 
that its registration on behalf of a 
beneficiary has been selected, and that 
the petitioner(s) may file a petition(s) for 
that beneficiary. A petitioner may file an 
H–1B cap-subject petition on behalf of 
a registered beneficiary only after the 
petitioner’s properly submitted 
registration for that beneficiary has been 
selected for that fiscal year.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES260965 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Rules and Regulations the highest Occupational Employment 
and Wage Statistics (OEWS) wage level 
that the beneficiary’s proffered wage 
equals or exceeds for the relevant 
Standard Occupational Classification 
(SOC) code in the area(s) of intended 
employment. If the beneficiary’s 
proffered wage is lower than OEWS 
wage level I, because it is based on a 
prevailing wage from another legitimate 
source (other than OEWS) or an 
independent authoritative source, the 
registrant must select ‘‘wage level I.’’ If 
the beneficiary will work in multiple 
locations, or in multiple positions if the 
registrant is an agent, the registrant must 
select the lowest corresponding OEWS 
wage level that the beneficiary’s 
proffered wage will equal or exceed. If 
the beneficiary’s proffered wage is 
expressed as a range, the registrant must 
select the OEWS wage level that the 
lowest wage in the range will equal or 
exceed. Where there is no current 
OEWS prevailing wage information for 
the beneficiary’s proffered position, the 
registrant must select the OEWS wage 
level that corresponds to the 
requirements of the beneficiary’s 
proffered position using the Department 
of Labor’s prevailing wage guidance. 
The registrant must also provide the 
SOC code of the proffered position, the 
area of intended employment that 
served as the basis of the wage level 
selected on the registration, the 
beneficiary’s valid passport or travel 
document information, and all other 
requested information, as well as make 
the necessary certifications, as specified 
on the registration form and 
instructions. Each beneficiary must only 
be registered under one valid passport 
or travel document, and if or when the 
beneficiary is abroad, the passport 
information or travel document 
information must correspond to the 
passport or travel document the 
beneficiary intends to use to enter the 
United States. 
(ii) Weighted selection. If a random selection is necessary, USCIS will assign 
each unique beneficiary to the lowest 
OEWS wage level among all 
registrations submitted on the 
beneficiary’s behalf and will enter each 
unique beneficiary into the selection 
pool in a weighted manner as follows: 
a beneficiary assigned wage level IV will 
be entered into the selection pool four 
times, a beneficiary assigned wage level 
III will be entered into the selection 
pool three times, a beneficiary assigned 
wage level II will be entered into the 
selection pool two times, and a 
beneficiary assigned wage level I will be 
entered into the selection pool one time. 
(5) *** 
(i) Fewer registrations than needed to meet the H–1B regular cap. At the end 
of the annual initial registration period, 
if USCIS determines that there are fewer 
unique beneficiaries on whose behalf 
registrations were properly submitted 
than needed to meet the H–1B regular 
cap, USCIS will notify all petitioners 
that have properly registered that their 
registrations have been selected. USCIS 
will keep the registration period open 
beyond the initial registration period, 
until it determines that it has received 
a sufficient number of registrations for 
unique beneficiaries to meet the H–1B 
regular cap. Once USCIS determines 
there is a sufficient number of properly 
registered unique beneficiaries to meet 
the H–1B regular cap, USCIS will no 
longer accept registrations for petitions 
subject to the H–1B regular cap under 
section 214(g)(1)(A) of the Act. USCIS 
will monitor the number of unique 
beneficiaries with properly submitted 
registrations and will notify the public 
of the date that USCIS has received the 
necessary number of registrations for 
unique beneficiaries (the ‘‘final 
registration date’’). The day the public is 
notified will not control the applicable 
final registration date. If USCIS has 
received more registrations for unique 
beneficiaries on the final registration 
date than necessary to meet the H–1B 
regular cap under section 214(g)(1)(A) of 
the Act, USCIS will weight each unique 
beneficiary as described in paragraph 
(h)(8)(iii)(A)(4)(ii) of this section and 
randomly select the number of unique 
beneficiaries deemed necessary to meet 
the H–1B regular cap. 
(ii) Sufficient registrations to meet the H–1B regular cap during initial 
registration period. At the end of the 
initial registration period, if USCIS 
determines that there is more than a 
sufficient number of unique 
beneficiaries on whose behalf 
registrations were properly submitted to 
meet the H–1B regular cap, USCIS will 
no longer accept registrations under 
section 214(g)(1)(A) of the Act and will 
notify the public of the final registration 
date. USCIS will weight each unique 
beneficiary as described in paragraph 
(h)(8)(iii)(A)(4)(ii) of this section and 
randomly select the number of unique 
beneficiaries deemed necessary to meet 
the H–1B regular cap. 
(6) *** 
(i) Fewer registrations than needed to meet the H–1B advanced degree 
exemption numerical limitation. If 
USCIS determines that there are fewer 
unique beneficiaries on whose behalf 
registrations were properly submitted 
than needed to meet the H–1B advanced 
degree exemption numerical limitation, 
USCIS will notify all petitioners that 
have properly registered that their 
registrations have been selected. USCIS 
will continue to accept registrations to 
file petitions for beneficiaries who may 
be eligible for the H–1B advanced 
degree exemption under section 
214(g)(5)(C) of the Act until USCIS 
determines that there is a sufficient 
number of properly registered unique 
beneficiaries to meet the H–1B 
advanced degree exemption numerical 
limitation. USCIS will monitor the 
number of unique beneficiaries with 
properly submitted registrations and 
will notify the public of the date that 
USCIS has received the necessary 
number of registrations for unique 
beneficiaries (the ‘‘final registration 
date’’). The day the public is notified 
will not control the applicable final 
registration date. If USCIS has received 
more registrations for unique 
beneficiaries on the final registration 
date than necessary to meet the H–1B 
advanced degree exemption numerical 
limitation under section 214(g)(1)(A) 
and 214(g)(5)(C) of the Act, USCIS will 
weight each unique beneficiary as 
described in paragraph 
(h)(8)(iii)(A)(4)(ii) of this section and 
randomly select the number of unique 
beneficiaries deemed necessary to meet 
the H–1B advanced degree exemption 
numerical limitation. 
(ii) Sufficient registrations to meet the H–1B advanced degree exemption 
numerical limitation. If USCIS 
determines that there is more than a 
sufficient number of unique 
beneficiaries on whose behalf 
registrations were properly submitted to 
meet the H–1B advanced degree 
exemption numerical limitation, USCIS 
will no longer accept registrations that 
may be eligible for exemption under 
section 214(g)(5)(C) of the Act and will 
notify the public of the final registration 
date. USCIS will weight each unique 
beneficiary as described in paragraph 
(h)(8)(iii)(A)(4)(ii) of this section and 
randomly select the number of unique 
beneficiaries deemed necessary to meet 
the H–1B advanced degree exemption 
numerical limitation. 
(7) Increase to the number of beneficiaries projected to meet the H–1B 
regular cap or advanced degree 
exemption allocations in a fiscal year. 
Unselected properly submitted 
registrations for unique beneficiaries 
will remain on reserve for the applicable 
fiscal year. If USCIS determines that it 
needs to increase the number of 
registrations for unique beneficiaries 
projected to meet the H–1B regular cap 
or advanced degree exemption 
allocation, and select additional unique 
beneficiaries, USCIS will select from 
among the unique beneficiaries with

on reserve a sufficient number to meet 
the H–1B regular cap or advanced 
degree exemption numerical limitation, 
as applicable. If all of the unique 
beneficiaries on reserve are selected and 
there are still fewer unique beneficiaries 
than needed to meet the H–1B regular 
cap or advanced degree exemption 
numerical limitation, as applicable, 
USCIS may reopen the applicable 
registration period until USCIS 
determines that it has received a 
sufficient number of registrations for 
unique beneficiaries projected as 
needed to meet the H–1B regular cap or 
advanced degree exemption numerical 
limitation. USCIS will monitor the 
number of properly registered unique 
beneficiaries and will notify the public 
of the date that USCIS has received the 
necessary number of registrations (the 
new ‘‘final registration date’’). The day 
the public is notified will not control 
the applicable final registration date. 
When selecting additional unique 
beneficiaries under this paragraph 
(h)(8)(iii)(A)(7), USCIS will select 
unique beneficiaries with properly 
submitted registrations in accordance 
with paragraphs (h)(8)(iii)(A)(4) through 
(6) of this section. If the registration 
period will be reopened, USCIS will 
announce the start of the re-opened 
registration period on the USCIS 
website at www.uscis.gov.

(1) Filing procedures. In addition to any other applicable requirements, a 
petitioner may file an H–1B petition for 
a beneficiary who may be counted 
under section 214(g)(1)(A) of the Act or 
eligible for exemption under section 
214(g)(5)(C) of the Act only if the 
petition is based on a valid registration, 
which means that the registration was 
properly submitted in accordance with 
§ 103.2(a)(1) of this chapter, paragraph 
(h)(8)(iii) of this section, and the 
registration tool instructions; and was 
submitted by the petitioner, or its 
designated representative, on behalf of 
the beneficiary who was selected for 
that cap season by USCIS. A petitioner 
may not substitute the beneficiary 
named in the original registration or 
transfer the registration to another 
petitioner. An H–1B petition filed on 
behalf of a beneficiary must contain and 
be supported by the same identifying 
information and position information, 
including SOC code, provided in the 
selected registration and indicated on 
the labor condition application used to 
support the petition, and must include 
a proffered wage that equals or exceeds 
the prevailing wage for the 
corresponding OEWS wage level in the 
registration for the SOC code in the 
area(s) of intended employment as 
described in paragraph (h)(8)(iii)(A)(4)(i) 
of this section. Petitioners must submit 
evidence of the basis of the wage level 
selected on the registration as of the 
date that the registration underlying the 
petition was submitted. Petitioners must 
also submit evidence of the passport or 
travel document used at the time of 
registration to identify the beneficiary. 
In its discretion, USCIS may find that a 
change in the beneficiary’s identifying 
information in some circumstances 
would be permissible. Such 
circumstances could include, but are 
not limited to, a legal name change due 
to marriage or a change in passport 
number or expiration date due to 
renewal or replacement of a stolen 
passport, in between the time of 
registration submission and petition 
filing. In its discretion, USCIS may find 
that a change in the area(s) of intended 
employment would be permissible, 
provided such change is consistent with 
the requirement of a bona fide job offer 
at the time of registration as stated in 
paragraph (h)(10)(ii) of this section. 
USCIS may deny or revoke the approval 
of an H–1B petition that does not meet 
these requirements. 
* * * * * 
(iv) * * * 
(B) Petition-based cap-subject selections in event of suspended 
registration process. In any year in 
which USCIS suspends the H–1B 
registration process for cap-subject 
petitions, USCIS will allow for the 
submission of H–1B petitions 
notwithstanding paragraph (h)(8)(iii) of 
this section and conduct a cap-subject 
selection process based on the petitions 
that are received. Each petitioner must 
select the highest OEWS wage level that 
the beneficiary’s proffered wage equals 
or exceeds for the relevant SOC code in 
the area(s) of intended employment. If 
the beneficiary’s proffered wage is lower 
than OEWS wage level I, because it is 
based on a prevailing wage from another 
legitimate source (other than OEWS) or 
an independent authoritative source, the 
petitioner must select ‘‘wage level I.’’ If 
the beneficiary will work in multiple 
locations, or in multiple positions if the 
petitioner is an agent, the petitioner 
must select the lowest corresponding 
OEWS wage level that the beneficiary’s 
proffered wage will equal or exceed. 
Where there is no current OEWS 
prevailing wage information for the 
beneficiary’s proffered position, the 
petitioner must select the appropriate 
wage level that corresponds to the 
requirements of the beneficiary’s 
proffered position using the Department 
of Labor’s prevailing wage guidance. If 
a random selection is necessary, each 
petition will be assigned the OEWS 
wage level selected in accordance with 
form instructions and will be entered 
into the selection pool in a weighted 
manner as follows: a petition assigned 
wage level IV will be entered into the 
selection pool four times, a petition 
assigned wage level III will be entered 
into the selection pool three times, a 
petition assigned wage level II will be 
entered into the selection pool two 
times, and a petition assigned wage 
level I will be entered into the selection 
pool one time. The selection will be 
made via computer-generated selection. 
Petitioners must submit evidence of the 
basis of the selected wage level as of the 
date the petition is submitted. USCIS 
will deny petitions indicating that they 
are exempt from the H–1B regular cap 
and the H–1B advanced degree 
exemption if USCIS determines, after 
the final receipt date, that they are not 
eligible for the exemption sought. If 
USCIS determines, on or before the final 
receipt date, that the petition is not 
eligible for the exemption sought, 
USCIS may consider the petition under 
the applicable numerical allocation and

(1) H–1B regular cap selection in event of suspended registration process. 
In determining whether there are 
enough H–1B cap-subject petitions to 
meet the H–1B regular cap, USCIS will 
consider all petitions properly 
submitted in accordance with § 103.2 of 
this chapter relating to beneficiaries 
who may be counted under section 
214(g)(1)(A) of the Act, including those 
who may be eligible for exemption 
under section 214(g)(5)(C) of the Act. 
When calculating the number of 
petitions needed to meet the H–1B 
regular cap, USCIS will take into 
account historical data related to 
approvals, denials, revocations, and 
other relevant factors. USCIS will 
monitor the number of petitions 
received and will announce on its 
website the date that it receives the 
number of petitions projected as needed 
to meet the H–1B regular cap (the ‘‘final 
receipt date’’). The date the 
announcement is posted will not control 
the final receipt date. If the final receipt 
date is any of the first five business days 
on which petitions subject to the H–1B 
regular cap may be received (in other 
words, if the numerical limitation is 
reached on any one of the first five 
business days that filings can be made),

described in paragraph (h)(8)(iv)(B) of 
this section and randomly select the 
number of petitions properly submitted 
during the first five business days 
deemed necessary to meet the H–1B

(2) Advanced degree exemption selection in event of suspended 
registration process. After USCIS has 
received a sufficient number of petitions 
to meet the H–1B regular cap and, as 
applicable, completed the random 
selection process of petitions for the H– 
1B regular cap, USCIS will determine 
whether there is a sufficient number of 
remaining petitions to meet the H–1B 
advanced degree exemption numerical 
limitation. When calculating the 
number of petitions needed to meet the 
H–1B advanced degree exemption 
numerical limitation, USCIS will take 
into account historical data related to 
approvals, denials, revocations, and 
other relevant factors. USCIS will

one of the first five business days that 
filings can be made), USCIS will weight 
each petition as described in paragraph

(ii) Denial for statement of facts on the petition, H–1B registration, 
temporary labor certification, or labor 
condition application, or invalid H–1B 
registration. The petition will be denied if it is determined that the statements on 
the petition, the H–1B registration (if 
applicable), the application for a 
temporary labor certification, or the 
labor condition application were 
inaccurate, fraudulent, or 
misrepresented a material fact, 
including if the certifications on the 
registration are determined to be false. 
An H–1B cap-subject petition also will 
be denied if it is not based on a valid 
registration submitted by the petitioner 
(or its designated representative), or a 
successor in interest, for the beneficiary 
named or identified in the petition. A 
valid registration must represent a bona 
fide job offer. 
(iii) Denial for attempt to unfairly increase the chance of selection. USCIS 
may deny a subsequent new or amended 
petition filed by the petitioner, or a 
related entity, on behalf of the same 
beneficiary, if USCIS determines that 
the filing of the new or amended 
petition is part of the petitioner’s 
attempt to unfairly increase the chance 
of selection during the registration or 
petition selection process, as applicable, 
such as by changing the proffered wage 
in a subsequent new or amended 
petition to an amount that would be 
equivalent to a lower wage level than 
that indicated on the registration, or the

I. Executive Summary 
A. Purpose of Deregulatory Action 
1. Administration Deregulatory 
Priorities 
On January 31, 2025, President Trump 
issued Executive Order (E.O.) 14192 
‘‘Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation,’’
1
which states that it is 
the policy of the Administration to 
significantly reduce the private 
expenditures required to comply with 
Federal regulations to secure America’s 
economic prosperity and national 
security and the highest possible quality 
of life for each citizen. ASTP/ONC is 
issuing this proposed rule in an effort to 
streamline and reduce administrative 
burdens on health care providers, health 
information technology (IT) developers, 
and the health IT community overall. 
This proposed rule would also improve 
patient and health care provider access 
to electronic health information (EHI) 
and promote health IT and health care 
market competition with proposals to 
revise the information blocking 
regulations. 
In order to implement the President’s 
deregulatory initiatives, and to better 
promote the health and well-being of 
the American people, HHS intends to 
dramatically expand its deregulatory 
efforts. An important component of 
Making America Healthy Again is 
making sure that health care providers 
and caretakers can focus on preventing 
and treating chronic diseases. By 
proposing to remove duplicative and 
unnecessary requirements of the ONC 
Health IT Certification Program 
(Certification Program), we will support 
providers in caring for their patients. 
Developers of certified health IT will 
have more time to support providers’ 
specific technological needs. Providers 
may also have more health IT choices to 
meet their needs through increased 
competition in the certified health IT 
market that may come from reduced 
barriers to entry for the certification of 
health IT. Further, proposed revisions to 
the information blocking regulations 
would support health care providers in 
using innovative third-party software 
with their EHRs as well as their access, 
exchange, and use of patients’ EHI. 
2. ASTP/ONC Implementation 
a. Certification Program and Information 
Blocking 
Since the inception of the 
Certification Program, ASTP/ONC has 
aimed to implement and administer the 
Certification Program in the least 
burdensome manner that supports an 
administration’s policy goals. 
Throughout the years, we have worked 
to improve the Certification Program 
with a focus on ways to reduce burden, 
offer flexibility to both developers and 
providers, and support innovation. Over 
the past 15 years, we have established 
a set of regulatory requirements that 
have provided a foundation for our 
voluntary Certification Program. As we 
look to the future, there is an 
opportunity to review the existing 
requirements and make updates as 
needed. Through both formal notice and 
comment rulemaking and informal 
engagements, we have received 
suggestions on how to update the 
Certification Program to meet current 
market needs. This proposed rule 
proposes deregulatory actions that: take 
into consideration these suggestions; 
account for the current and future state 
of technology; reduce burden by 
eliminating redundant requirements; 
and promote innovation for health IT 
developers, providers, and other 
interested parties. We have also 
evaluated the information blocking 
regulations and propose the removal of 
one exception, removal and revisions of 
conditions of other exceptions, and 
revisions of definitions to better 
promote EHI access, exchange, and use. 
Together, these efforts directly align 
with Administration goals as outlined in 
E.O. 14192 (Unleashing Prosperity 
through Deregulation)
2
and E.O. 14267 
(Reducing Anti-Competitive Regulatory 
Barriers).

standard. FHIR aimed to build on prior 
HL7 work, including well-established 
messaging and document standards 
(e.g., HL7 Version 2, Clinical Document Architecture (CDA)). It also sought to 
improve developer usability and ease of 
implementation by leveraging 
internet-scale tooling common to 
modern web services. Rooted in a 
RESTful architectural style,

FHIR 
organizes data into granular ‘‘resources’’

MedicationRequest) that can be created, 
read, updated, or deleted through 
standard HTTP operations and 
expressed in formats such as JSON. 
FHIR was designed to help reduce 
implementer variation, allow for 
widespread web security conventions to 
be layered in (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and TLS), and facilitate more 
incremental adoption through 
modularity. 
Since FHIR Draft Standard for Trial 
Use (DSTU) 1 was officially published 
in September 2014, HL7 has iteratively 
advanced FHIR through a 
comprehensive ballot process that 
combines industry pilots, 
Connectathons, and formal community 
review. In 2015, ONC released the 
‘‘2015 Edition Health Information 
Technology (Health IT) Certification 
Criteria, 2015 Edition Base Electronic 
Health Record (EHR) Definition, and 
ONC Health IT Certification Program 
Modifications’’ Final Rule (2015 Edition 
Final Rule) (80 FR 62602), which among 
other requirements, adopted non- 
standards-based, functional application 
programming interface (API) 
certification criteria (45 CFR 
170.315(g)(7), (8), and (9)). The adoption 
of these certification criteria combined 
with the data elements specified in the 
‘‘common clinical data set’’ (CCDS) 
helped catalyze the industry to focus on 
developing a consistent implementation 
guide for FHIR-based API deployment 
in the United States (US). This industry- 
led effort resulted in the ‘‘Argonaut Data 
Query Implementation Guide’’ based on 
FHIR DSTU 2, which became commonly 
deployed in production and used as the 
basis to build early versions of patient 
access applications with the potential 
for nationwide scale.
6
 
In parallel to this wave of standards 
development and industry 
implementation, API-focused 
interoperability policy also advanced. 
The 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) 
(Pub. L. 114–255) was signed into law 
at the end of 2016 and ASTP/ONC 
subsequently engaged in rulemaking to 
implement its provisions. This 
included, among other new policies, the 
adoption of a FHIR-based API 
certification criterion (45 CFR 
170.315(g)(10)) and the establishment of 
an API Condition of Certification, which 
focused on the publication of APIs that 
would allow EHI ‘‘to be accessed, 
exchanged, and used without special 
effort . . . including providing access to 
all data elements of a patient’s 
electronic health record . . .’’. On May 
1, 2020, ONC published the ‘‘21st 
Century Cures Act: Interoperability, 
Information Blocking, and the ONC 
Health IT Certification Program’’ Final 
Rule (Cures Act Final Rule) (85 FR 
25642), which adopted a suite of FHIR- 
based requirements in the Certification 
Program. This final rule required 
support for HL7’s FHIR US Core 
Implementation Guide (IG) (based on 
FHIR Release 4 and consistent with 
United States Core Data for 
Interoperability (USCDI) v1 data 
elements), FHIR Bulk Data Access 
Implementation Guide, and HL7

 
SMART Application Launch Framework 
Implementation Guide. We stated that 
developers of certified health IT 
certified to the applicable criteria were 
required to upgrade certified health IT 
to these FHIR API standards and 
provide them to their customers by no 
later than May 2, 2022, in the Cures Act 
Final Rule (85 FR 25948). We then 
extended the compliance date to 
December 31, 2022, in the ‘‘Information 
Blocking and the ONC Health IT 
Certification Program: Extension of 
Compliance Dates and Timeframes in 
Response to the COVID–19 Public 
Health Emergency Interim’’ Final Rule 
(85 FR 70072). 
In the years since the Cures Act Final 
Rule, ASTP/ONC and industry 
established an iterative, annual cycle 
whereby a new USCDI version is 
released that then helps inform further 
data element constraints for a new 
version of the FHIR-based US Core IG. 
This predictable, consistent, and 
collaborative approach has been 
transformative for standards 
development and FHIR-based policy 
making. It has also positioned the US as 
a world leader in FHIR adoption and 
use. Other federal agencies, such as the 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services (CMS), Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), Health 
Resources and Services Administration 
(HRSA), and National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) have also pursued FHIR- 
oriented regulatory policy and program 
implementations based on this 
foundation. 
Resetting the Certification Program for a 
FHIR-Enabled Future 
America’s interoperability arc in 
health care has bent decisively toward 
FHIR-based APIs. An open, 
interoperable health data ecosystem 
invites entrepreneurship, drives 
innovation, and cements American 
leadership and competitiveness in the 
expanding digital health marketplace. 
As discussed in this deregulatory 
proposed rule, we propose to 
aggressively reduce and remove long- 
standing functionality-oriented and 
non-FHIR-based certification criteria 
from the Certification Program. While 
this approach would directly and 
rapidly reduce compliance burdens for 
health IT developers that participate in 
the Certification Program, more broadly, 
it enables ASTP/ONC to reset the 
Certification Program’s regulatory scope 
and establish a new foundation on 
which to build FHIR-based API 
requirements in the future. This would 
allow more creative artificial 
intelligence (AI)-enabled 
interoperability solutions that combine 
FHIR with newer standards to emerge, 
such as Model Context Protocol (MCP) 
which ‘‘standardizes how applications 
provide context to Large Language 
Models (LLMs)’’,

and further embrace 
the Cures Act’s reference to ‘‘. . . 
successor technology or standards . . .’’ 
in the API Condition of Certification.

While FHIR provides the potential for 
better, faster, and more consistent ways 
to address emerging market needs and 
policy imperatives, more work is 
needed for certain use cases. We intend 
to continue to fully engage industry and 
our federal partners, such as CMS, to 
rapidly advance FHIR specifications for 
regulatory readiness. We also intend to 
sharpen the Certification Program’s 
future focus to prioritize FHIR-based 
APIs that: (1) enhance automation and 
API performance; (2) move beyond read- 
only interactions; and (3) expand the 
scope of data available to support 
clinical efficiency, patient-centered 
care, and timely reporting (e.g., public health, quality, government programs) 
use cases. 
The transition to a FHIR-based API 
ecosystem is a strategic imperative and 
an investment in the US’s 
interoperability future. To execute this 
vision, it will require a collective 
commitment from policymakers, 
software developers, clinicians, payers, 
and patients alike. Together, we can 
build interoperable solutions that meet 
today’s challenges and anticipate 
tomorrow’s opportunities. 
In this proposed rule, our proposals 
remove or revise certain certification 
criteria that are consistent with our 
drive toward and our support for the 
FHIR standard, as discussed above. The 
push toward universal adoption of FHIR 
is not just important for secure, 
streamlined data access, it is a critical 
step toward modernizing our health care 
system with the ultimate goal of Making 
America Healthy Again.

B. Summary of Major Provisions 
1. Health Information Technology 
Standards, Implementation 
Specifications, and Certification Criteria 
and Certification Programs for Health 
Information Technology (Part 170) 
a. Certification Criteria for Health 
Information Technology 
We have identified certification 
criteria for proposed removal or 
revision. The removal or revision of the 
identified certification criteria would 
reduce burden and costs for health IT 
developers and clinicians, for reasons 
including but not limited to, eliminating 
the need to design and meet specific 
certification functionalities; prepare, 
test, and certify health IT in certain 
instances; and maintain conformance to 
certification requirements. We do not 
anticipate that the proposed removals or 
revisions would alter behavior across 
product implementations by health IT 
developers for the capabilities that have 
thus far been included as part of 
certification criteria in the Certification 
Program. We have observed over time 
that certification is likely no longer a 
primary factor driving improvements or 
compliance in particular areas, such as 
with respect to privacy and security. 
Generally, at the time of certification, 
developers have (in some cases for over 
a decade) consistently demonstrated for 
many certification criteria that their 
certified health IT can perform required 
functionalities in a conformant 
manner.
9
Throughout this proposed 
rule, we have included proposed 
revisions and removals of certification 
criteria that, among other factors, we 
believe are no longer necessary to 
advance interoperability and no longer 
provide a strong market driver for initial 
adoption and implementation of the 
certified functionalities. 
In total, out of the 60 certification 
criteria that are currently in effect, we 
propose to remove 34 and revise seven. 
Of the revised criteria, one of the 
proposed revisions would reduce the 
scope of the ‘‘decision support 
interventions’’ certification criterion to 
fully remove the artificial intelligence 
(AI) ‘‘model card’’ requirements. We 
intend to retain and make no changes to 
19 certification criteria, which include 
new and revised certification criteria 
that were adopted in the Health Data, 
Technology, and Interoperability: 
Electronic Prior Authorization and Real- 
Time Prescription Benefit (HTI–4) Final 
Rule (90 FR 37130). This final rule was 
published as a part of the ‘‘Medicare 
Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective 
Payment Systems for Acute Care 
Hospitals (IPPS) and the Long-Term 
Care Hospital Prospective Payment 
System and Policy Changes and Fiscal 
Year (FY) 2026 Rates; Changes to the FY 
2025 IPPS Rates Due to Court Decision; 
Requirements for Quality Programs; and 
Other Policy Changes; Health Data, 
Technology, and Interoperability: 
Electronic Prescribing, Real-Time 
Prescription Benefit and Electronic Prior 
Authorization’’ (FY2026 IPPS/LTCH 
PPS) Final Rule, which was published 
by CMS on August 4, 2025 (90 FR 
36536). 
b. Standards and Implementation 
Specifications for Health Information 
Technology 
In some instances where we propose 
to remove or revise a certain 
certification criterion, we also propose 
to remove the standard(s) that is 
referenced by the certification criterion. 
In some cases, we propose to remove 
standards consistent with a certification 
criterion transition period until January 
1, 2027. In very limited circumstances, 
we retain a standard referenced in a 
certification criterion proposed for 
removal for purposes of health IT 
interoperability alignment.
10
We also 
propose to remove standards that are 
outdated and no longer referenced in 
the Certification Program. Lastly, we 
propose to adopt USCDI v3.1 in 
§ 170.213. 
c. Terms and Definitions 
Because of the proposed removal of 
certain certification criteria as discussed 
above, we propose to make conforming 
edits to the terms and definitions in 
§ 170.102. We propose to revise the 
definition of ‘‘Base EHR’’ to remove 
references to criteria that we have 
proposed to remove from the Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR). We also 
propose to remove the definitions of 
‘‘Common Clinical Data Set,’’ ‘‘Global 
Unique Device Identification Database 
(GUDID),’’ and ‘‘Production Identifier’’ 
because these terms are no longer 
referenced in 45 CFR part 170. 
d. Conditions and Maintenance of 
Certification Requirements for Health IT 
Developers 
We propose to make conforming edits 
for several Conditions and Maintenance 
of Certification requirements, including 
the ‘‘Assurances’’ (§ 170.402), 
‘‘Application Programming Interfaces’’ 
(§ 170.404), and ‘‘Attestations’’ 
(§ 170.406) Conditions and Maintenance 
of Certification requirements. In 
addition to conforming edits, we also 
propose to descope the ‘‘Real World 
Testing’’ Condition and Maintenance of 
Certification requirements (§ 170.405) 
with deregulatory actions related to real 
world testing plans, results, and the use 
of the standards version advancement 
process (SVAP). These proposals are 
consistent with the enforcement 
discretion notice we issued on June 30, 
2025.
11
Lastly, we propose to remove 
and descope measures associated with 
the ‘‘Insights’’ Condition and 
Maintenance of Certification 
requirements (§ 170.407), consistent 
with the enforcement discretion we 
issued on April 29, 2025,
12
to limit 
reporting requirements only to the ‘‘use 
of FHIR in apps through certified health 
IT’’ measure. 
e. ONC Health IT Certification Program 
Administrative Requirements 
We propose to make conforming edits, 
to remove references to certification 
criteria that we propose to remove in 
this proposed rule, in subpart E of 45 
CFR part 170. Specifically, in 
§§ 170.523, 170.550, 170.555, and 
170.570. 
2. Information Blocking (Part 171) 
We propose to revise the § 171.102 
‘‘access’’ and ‘‘use’’ definitions to 
emphasize that the definitions include 
automated means of access, exchange, 
or use of EHI—including, without 
limitation, autonomous AI systems. As 
an alternative proposal, we propose, in 
addition to updating the ‘‘access’’ and 
‘‘use’’ definitions, to revise the 
‘‘exchange’’ definition in a similar 
manner. 
We propose to remove the third party 
seeking modification use condition from 
the Infeasibility Exception 
(§ 171.204(a)(3)). This condition is 
susceptible to misuse by actors 
withholding EHI to unnecessarily 
inhibit access, exchange, and use of EHI 
by third parties that patients and health 
care providers want. Where any 
requested access, exchange, or use of 
EHI poses concerns such as specific 
threats to the confidentiality, integrity, 
or availability of the EHI involved, this 
condition is unnecessary. Activities 
reasonable and necessary to address 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:47 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\29DEP2.SGM 29DEP2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260974 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Proposed Rules those concerns are covered by other 
exceptions. 
We propose to revise or, in the 
alternative, remove the manner 
exception exhausted condition 
(§ 171.204(a)(4)) from the Infeasibility 
Exception. Similar to the third party 
seeking modification use condition 
(§ 171.204(a)(3)), we believe this 
condition as currently codified is 
susceptible to misuse by actors holding 
EHI to unnecessarily inhibit access, 
exchange, and use of EHI. The revisions 
we propose to the manner exception 
exhausted condition (§ 171.204(a)(4)) would narrow its application to better 
align with our intent for this condition 
and reduce the risk of an actor misusing 
it. In the alternative, we propose to 
remove the entire condition to address 
our concerns. 
We propose to revise the Manner 
Exception’s manner requested condition (§ 171.301(a)) to ensure that it is clear 
that the Manner Exception cannot be 
met with contracts that are not market 
rate, are contracts of adhesion, or are 
contracts containing unconscionable 
terms. 
We propose to remove subpart D from 
45 CFR part 171, which includes the 
Trusted Exchange Framework and 
Common Agreement
TM
(TEFCA
TM
) 
Manner Exception (§ 171.403) and 
associated definitions. Based on 
TEFCA’s continued implementation, 
maturation, and public comments 
received—including those received in 
response to the CMS–ASTP/ONC 
Request for Information; Health 
Technology Ecosystem (90 FR 21034) 
(CMS–ASTP/ONC RFI)—we believe the 
removal of the TEFCA Manner 
Exception (§ 171.403) is appropriate. 
C. Severability 
It is our intent that if any provision of 
this rule were, if or when finalized, held 
to be invalid or unenforceable facially, 
or as applied to any person, plaintiff, or 
stayed pending further judicial or 
agency action, such provision shall be 
severable from other provisions of this 
rule, and from rules and regulations 
currently in effect, and not affect the 
remainder of this rule. It is also our 
intent that, unless such provision shall 
be held to be utterly invalid or 
unenforceable, it be construed to give 
the provision maximum effect permitted 
by law including in the application of 
the provision to other persons not 
similarly situated or to other, dissimilar 
circumstances from those where the 
provision may be held to be invalid or 
unenforceable. 
In this rule, we propose provisions 
that are intended to and will operate 
independently of each other, even if 
multiple of them serve the same or 
similar general purpose(s) or policy 
goal(s). Where a provision is necessarily 
dependent on another, the context 
generally makes that clear (such as by 
cross-reference to a particular standard, 
requirement, condition, or pre- 
requisite). Where a provision that is 
dependent on one that is stayed or held 
invalid or unenforceable (as described 
in the preceding paragraph) is included 
in a subparagraph, paragraph, or section 
within part 170 or 171 of 45 CFR, we 
intend that other provisions of such 
subparagraph(s), paragraph(s), or 
section(s) that operate independently of 
said provision would remain in effect. 
For example, if any proposed revision 
of any section or paragraph of part 170, 
if finalized, were stayed or held utterly 
invalid or unenforceable, we would 
intend for all other finalized revisions in 
part 170 that do not depend upon the 
stayed or invalidated revision to remain 
in full effect. To illustrate, if a removal 
of a certification criterion were to be 
finalized and then held to be entirely 
invalid or unenforceable, any 
corresponding removal of a cross- 
reference to that provision would 
depend on that revision and would be 
affected by the holding of invalidity or 
unenforceability. But in direct contrast, 
any revision to any other certification 
criterion or other Certification Program 
requirement or provision codified in 
part 170 that is not made based 
specifically on the removal of the 
certification criterion for which removal 
was held invalid or unenforceable, is 
intended to remain in full effect even if 
both revisions were proposed in this 
same proposed rule and were to be 
finalized in a single final rule. 
To provide another example, if we 
were to finalize the proposed removal of 
paragraph (a)(3) from § 171.204 (the 
Infeasibility Exception), and the 
removal of this paragraph was stayed or 
held facially invalid or unenforceable in 
whole or in part, we would intend for 
other finalized revisions in part 171, 
including without limitation the 
proposed revision or, in the alternative, 
removal of paragraph (a)(4) from 
§ 171.204 (the Infeasibility Exception) to 
continue in effect. Each of the 
conditions (subparagraphs) within 
§ 171.204(a) is designed to stand 
independent of any and every other 
subparagraph in § 171.204(a). Moreover, 
each information blocking exception is 
intended and designed to stand 
independent of any and every other 
exception unless any specific provision 
of an exception might explicitly 
reference another exception. Likewise, 
any dependency on cross-referenced 
provision(s) is intended to be limited to 
the exact provision, or function of such 
provision, that relies upon the cross- 
reference. For example, paragraph (a)(4) 
in § 171.204 cross-references 
subparagraphs (1)(i) and (1)(ii) in 
§ 171.301(b) (the Manner Exception’s 
alternative manner condition). If either 
§ 171.301(b)(1)(i) or (ii) were to be held 
facially invalid or unenforceable, 
paragraph (a)(4) in § 171.204 as 
currently codified is intended to remain 
in effect, including with respect to its 
cross-references to § 171.301(b) as a 
whole and to whichever of the cross- 
referenced paragraphs ((i) or (ii)) in 
§ 171.301(b)(1) was not held facially 
invalid or unenforceable. 
If any revision to any provision of part 
170 or 171 (such as the removal or 
revision of a specific condition within 
one information blocking exception in 
part 171 or a revision to a certification 
criterion in part 170) were stayed or 
held to be invalid or unenforceable as 
applied to any person, plaintiff, or 
circumstance, it is our intent that such 
provision—and any section or 
paragraph of part 171 or 170 that may 
reference such provision—be construed 
to give the provision maximum effect 
permitted by law including in the 
application of the provision to other 
persons not similarly situated or to 
other, dissimilar circumstances from 
those where the provision may be held 
to be invalid or unenforceable. 
D. Costs and Benefits 
The Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) 
includes an updated analysis of the 
costs and benefits associated with the 
proposals in this proposed rule. The 
proposed deregulatory actions provide 
substantial relief for developers of 
certified health IT and significant cost 
savings realized from the revision and 
removal of certain Certification Program 
requirements. The cost savings have 
been estimated using the best available 
data and modeled on the costs estimated 
and finalized in prior ASTP/ONC 
rulemakings. The proposed deregulatory 
actions reduce the effort of developers 
of certified health IT to meet ongoing 
Certification Program requirements and 
reduce entry barriers for new 
Certification Program participants. The 
proposed actions, importantly, return 
effort back to developers of certified 
health IT to innovate with their 
technology, improve interoperability 
and third-party integration, and focus 
on the needs of their customers. We do 
not expect costs to be associated with 
these deregulatory proposals. We expect 
the proposed deregulatory actions to 
result in significant benefits for health 
IT developers, providers, ONC- 
Authorized Certification Bodies (ONC– 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:47 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\29DEP2.SGM 29DEP2
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260975 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Proposed Rules ACBs), ONC-Authorized Testing 
Laboratories (ONC–ATLs), and ASTP/ 
ONC. Generally, these benefits are in the 
form of cost and time savings and 
reductions in administrative burden to 
comply with Certification Program 
requirements. The proposed actions 
reduce the scope and breadth of 
Certification Program requirements. 
The analysis included in this 
proposed rule indicates that the 
proposed updates to the Certification 
Program would result in $0 in 
implementation costs on developers of 
certified health IT. However, we do 
estimate some costs for reviewers who 
review this proposed rule. We estimate 
those costs to be $284,132 in total for an 
estimated 644 reviewers, which include 
developers and medical associations. 
We do not quantify benefits for this 
proposed rule and instead rely on our 
calculation of cost savings to developers 
of certified health IT to quantify in 
dollars the time and effort developers 
would have expended had these 
requirements remained in effect in 
perpetuity. In total, this proposed 
rulemaking would result in a present 
value of cost savings of $1.53 billion in 
2024 dollars and discounted at a rate of 
7%, beginning in 2027 and in 
perpetuity. 
II. Background 
A. Statutory Basis 
The Health Information Technology 
for Economic and Clinical Health Act 
(HITECH Act), Title XIII of Division A 
and Title IV of Division B of the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111–5), was enacted 
on February 17, 2009. The HITECH Act 
amended the Public Health Service Act 
(PHSA) and created ‘‘Title XXX—Health 
Information Technology and Quality’’ 
(Title XXX) to improve health care 
quality, safety, and efficiency through 
the promotion of health IT and 
electronic health information (EHI) 
exchange. 
The 21st Century Cures Act (Pub. L. 
114–255) (Cures Act) was enacted on 
December 13, 2016, to accelerate the 
discovery, development, and delivery of 
21st century cures, and for other 
purposes. The Cures Act, through Title 
IV—Delivery, amended the HITECH Act 
by modifying or adding certain 
provisions to the PHSA relating to 
health IT. 
1. Standards, Implementation 
Specifications, and Certification Criteria 
The HITECH Act established two 
Federal advisory committees, the Health 
IT Policy Committee (HITPC) and the 
Health IT Standards Committee 
(HITSC). Each was responsible for 
advising the National Coordinator for 
Health Information Technology 
(National Coordinator) on different 
aspects of standards, implementation 
specifications, and certification criteria. 
Section 4003(e) of the Cures Act 
amended sections 3002 and 3003 of the 
PHSA by replacing, in an amended 
section 3002, the HITPC and HITSC 
with one committee named the Health 
Information Technology Advisory 
Committee (Health IT Advisory 
Committee or HITAC). Section 3002(a) 
of the PHSA, as added by the Cures Act, 
establishes that the HITAC recommends 
to the National Coordinator policies and 
standards, implementation 
specifications, and certification criteria, 
relating to the implementation of a 
health information technology 
infrastructure, nationally and locally, 
that advances the electronic access, 
exchange, and use of health 
information. Further described in 
section 3002(b)(1) of the PHSA, this 
includes recommending to the National 
Coordinator a policy framework to 
advance interoperable health 
information technology infrastructure, 
updating recommendations to the policy 
framework, and making new 
recommendations, as appropriate. 
Section 3002(b)(2)(A) of the PHSA 
specifies that in general, the HITAC 
shall recommend to the National 
Coordinator for purposes of adoption 
under section 3004, standards, 
implementation specifications, and 
certification criteria and an order of 
priority for the development, 
harmonization, and recognition of such 
standards, specifications, and 
certification criteria. Like the process 
previously required of the former HITPC 
and HITSC, section 3002(b)(5) of the 
PHSA requires the HITAC to develop a 
schedule, updated annually, for the 
assessment of policy recommendations, 
which the Secretary publishes in the 
Federal Register. 
Section 3004 of the PHSA establishes 
a process for the adoption of health IT 
standards, implementation 
specifications, and certification criteria 
and authorizes the Secretary to adopt 
such standards, implementation 
specifications, and certification criteria. 
As specified in section 3004(a)(1), the 
Secretary is required, in consultation 
with representatives of other relevant 
federal agencies, to jointly review 
standards, implementation 
specifications, and certification criteria 
endorsed by the National Coordinator in 
section 3001(c) and subsequently 
determine whether to propose the 
adoption of such standards, 
implementation specifications, or 
certification criteria. Section 3004(a)(3) 
requires the Secretary to publish all 
such determinations in the Federal 
Register. 
Section 3004(b)(3) of the PHSA, titled, 
Subsequent Standards Activity, 
provides that the Secretary shall adopt 
additional standards, implementation 
specifications, and certification criteria 
as necessary and consistent with the 
schedule published by the HITAC. We 
consider this provision in the broader 
context of the HITECH Act and Cures 
Act to grant the Secretary the authority 
and discretion to adopt standards, 
implementation specifications, and 
certification criteria that have been 
recommended by the HITAC and 
endorsed by the National Coordinator, 
as well as other appropriate and 
necessary health IT standards, 
implementation specifications, and 
certification criteria. 
2. Health IT Certification Program 
Section 3001(c)(5) of the PHSA 
provides the National Coordinator with 
the authority to establish a certification 
program or programs for the voluntary 
certification of health IT. Section 
3001(c)(5)(A) specifies that the National 
Coordinator, in consultation with the 
Director of the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST), shall 
keep or recognize a program or 
programs for the voluntary certification 
of health IT that is in compliance with 
applicable certification criteria adopted 
in section 3004 of the PHSA. 
The certification program(s) must also 
include, as appropriate, testing of the 
technology in accordance with section 
13201(b) of the HITECH Act. Overall, 
section 13201(b) of the HITECH Act 
requires that, with respect to the 
development of standards and 
implementation specifications, the 
Director of NIST shall support the 
establishment of a conformance testing 
infrastructure, including the 
development of technical test beds. The 
HITECH Act also indicates that the 
development of this conformance 
testing infrastructure may include a 
program to accredit independent, non- 
federal laboratories to perform testing. 
Section 4002(a) of the Cures Act 
amended section 3001(c)(5) of the PHSA 
by adding section 3001(c)(5)(D), which 
requires the Secretary, through notice 
and comment rulemaking, to require 
conditions of certification and 
maintenance of certification for the 
Certification Program. Specifically, the 
health IT developers or entities with 
technology certified under the 
Certification Program must, in order to 
maintain such certification status, 
adhere to certain conditions and

B. Regulatory History 
The Secretary issued an interim final 
rule with request for comments on 
January 13, 2010, ‘‘Health Information 
Technology: Initial Set of Standards, 
Implementation Specifications, and 
Certification Criteria for Electronic 
Health Record Technology’’ (the ‘‘S&CC 
January 2010 Interim Final Rule’’) (75 
FR 2014), which adopted an initial set 
of standards, implementation 
specifications, and certification criteria. 
On March 10, 2010, the Secretary issued 
a proposed rule, ‘‘Proposed 
Establishment of Certification Programs 
for Health Information Technology’’ (75 
FR 11328), that proposed both 
temporary and permanent certification 
programs for the purposes of testing and 
certifying health IT. A final rule 
establishing the temporary certification 
program was published on June 24, 
2010, ‘‘Establishment of the Temporary 
Certification Program for Health 
Information Technology’’ (75 FR 36158), 
and a final rule establishing the 
permanent certification program was 
published on January 7, 2011, 
‘‘Establishment of the Permanent 
Certification Program for Health 
Information Technology’’ (76 FR 1262). 
After consideration of the comments 
received on the S&CC January 2010 
Interim Final Rule, a final rule was 
issued to complete the adoption of the 
initial set of standards, implementation 
specifications, and certification criteria 
and realign them with the final 
objectives and measures established for 
the EHR Incentive Programs Stage 1, 
titled ‘‘Health Information Technology: 
Initial Set of Standards, Implementation 
Specifications, and Certification Criteria 
for Electronic Health Record 
Technology’’ (75 FR 44590, July 28, 
2010) (2011 Edition Final Rule). The 
2011 Edition Final Rule also established 
the first version of the certified 
electronic health record technology 
(CEHRT) definition. Subsequent to the 
2011 Edition Final Rule, on October 13, 
2010, we issued an interim final rule 
‘‘Health Information Technology: 
Revisions to Initial Set of Standards, 
Implementation Specifications, and 
Certification Criteria for Electronic 
Health Record Technology’’ with a 
request for comment to remove certain 
implementation specifications related to 
public health surveillance that had been 
previously adopted in the 2011 Edition 
Final Rule (75 FR 62686). 
The standards, implementation 
specifications, and certification criteria 
adopted by the Secretary in the 2011 
Edition Final Rule established the 
capabilities that CEHRT must include in 
order to, at a minimum, support the 
achievement of EHR Incentive Programs 
Stage 1 by eligible professionals (EPs), 
eligible hospitals, and critical access 
hospitals (CAHs) under the ‘‘Medicare 
and Medicaid Programs; Electronic 
Health Record Incentive Program’’ final 
rule (75 FR 44314, July 28, 2010) (EHR 
Incentive Programs Stage 1 Final Rule). 
On March 7, 2012, the Secretary 
issued a proposed rule with request for 
comments titled ‘‘Health Information 
Technology: Standards, Implementation 
Specifications, and Certification Criteria 
for Electronic Health Record 
Technology, 2014 Edition; Revisions to 
the Permanent Certification Program for 
Health Information Technology’’ (77 FR 
13832) (2014 Edition Proposed Rule), 
which proposed new and revised 
standards, implementation 
specifications, and certification criteria. 
After consideration of the comments 
received on the 2014 Edition Proposed 
Rule, a final rule titled ‘‘Health 
Information Technology: Standards, 
Implementation Specifications, and 
Certification Criteria for Electronic 
Health Record Technology, 2014 
Edition; Revisions to the Permanent 
Certification Program for Health 
Information Technology’’ (77 FR 54163) 
(2014 Edition Final Rule) was issued on 
September 4, 2012, to adopt the 2014 
Edition set of standards, 
implementation specifications, and 
certification criteria and realign them 
with the final objectives and measures 
established for the EHR Incentive 
Programs Stage 2, as well as Stage 1 
revisions. The 2014 Edition Final Rule 
adopted a proposal to change the 
Permanent Certification Program’s name 
to the ‘‘ONC HIT Certification Program,’’ 
revised the process for permitting the 
use of newer versions of ‘‘minimum 
standard’’ code sets, modified the 
certification processes ONC–ACBs need 
to follow for certifying EHR Modules in 
a manner that provides clear 
implementation direction and 
compliance with the new certification 
criteria, and eliminated the certification 
requirement that every EHR Module be 
certified to the ‘‘privacy and security’’ 
certification criteria. 
The standards, implementation 
specifications, and certification criteria 
adopted by the Secretary in the 2014 
Edition Final Rule established the 
capabilities that CEHRT must include in 
order to, at a minimum, support the 
achievement of the EHR Incentive 
Programs Stage 2 by EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs under the 
‘‘Medicare and Medicaid Programs; 
Electronic Health Record Incentive 
Program—Stage 2’’ final rule (77 FR 
53968, September 4, 2012) (EHR 
Incentive Programs Stage 2 Final Rule). 
On December 7, 2012, an interim final 
rule with a request for comment, titled 
‘‘Health Information Technology: 
Revisions to the 2014 Edition Electronic 
Health Record Certification Criteria; and 
Medicare and Medicaid Programs; 
Revisions to the Electronic Health 
Record Incentive Program’’ (77 FR 
72985), was jointly issued and 
published by ONC and CMS to update 
certain standards that had been 
previously adopted in the 2014 Edition 
Final Rule. The interim final rule also 
revised the EHR Incentive Programs by 
adding an alternative measure for the 
Stage 2 objective for hospitals to provide 
structured electronic laboratory results 
to ambulatory providers, corrected the 
regulation text for the measures 
associated with the objective for 
hospitals to provide patients the ability 
to view online, download, and transmit 
information about a hospital admission, 
and made the case number threshold 
exemption policy for clinical quality 
measure (CQM) reporting applicable for 
eligible hospitals and CAHs beginning 
with FY 2013. In addition, the interim 
final rule provided notice of CMS’s 
intent to issue technical corrections to 
the electronic specifications for CQMs 
released on October 25, 2012. On 
September 4, 2014, a final rule 
‘‘Medicare and Medicaid Programs; 
Modifications to the Medicare and 
Medicaid Electronic Health Record 
(EHR) Incentive Program for 2014 and 
Other Changes to the EHR Incentive

published adopting these proposals. 
On November 4, 2013, the Secretary 
published an interim final rule with a 
request for comment titled ‘‘2014

testing and certification. 
On February 26, 2014, the Secretary 
published a proposed rule titled 
‘‘Voluntary 2015 Edition Electronic 
Health Record (EHR) Certification 
Criteria; Interoperability Updates and 
Regulatory Improvements’’ (79 FR 
10880) (‘‘Voluntary Edition Proposed 
Rule’’). The proposed rule proposed a 
voluntary edition of certification criteria 
that was designed to enhance 
interoperability, promote innovation, 
and incorporate ‘‘bug fixes’’ to improve 
upon the 2014 Edition. The Voluntary 
Edition Proposed Rule also included 
proposals that focused on improving 
regulatory clarity, simplifying the 
certification of EHR Modules that are 
designed for purposes other than 
meeting requirements of the EHR 
Incentive Programs, and discontinuing 
the use of the Complete EHR definition. 
A correction notice was published for 
the Voluntary Edition Proposed Rule on 
March 19, 2014, entitled ‘‘Voluntary 
2015 Edition Electronic Health Record 
(EHR) Certification Criteria; 
Interoperability Updates and Regulatory 
Improvements; Correction’’ (79 FR 
15282). This correction notice corrected 
the preamble text and gap certification 
table for four certification criteria that 
were omitted from the list of 
certification criteria eligible for gap 
certification for the 2015 Edition EHR 
certification criteria. On September 11, 
2014, a final rule was published titled 
‘‘2014 Edition Release 2 Electronic 
Health Record (EHR) Certification 
Criteria and the ONC HIT Certification 
Program; Regulatory Flexibilities, 
Improvements, and Enhanced Health 
Information Exchange’’ (79 FR 54430) 
(2014 Edition Release 2 Final Rule). The 
final rule adopted a small subset of the 
original proposals in the Voluntary 
Edition Proposed Rule as optional and 
revised 2014 Edition EHR certification 
criteria that provide flexibility, clarity, 
and enhance health information 
exchange. It also finalized 
administrative proposals (i.e., removal of regulatory text from the CFR) and 
proposals for the ONC HIT Certification 
Program that provide improvements. We 
issued the 2014 Edition Release 2 Final 
Rule to complete the rulemaking for the 
Voluntary Edition Proposed Rule. The 
2014 Edition Release 2 Final Rule 
discontinued the ‘‘Complete EHR’’ 
certification concept beginning with the 
proposed 2015 Edition, adopted an 
updated standard (ISO/IEC 17065) for 
the accreditation of ONC–ACBs, and 
adopted the ‘‘ONC Certified HIT’’ 
certification and design mark for 
required use by ONC–ACBs under the 
Certification Program. 
On May 23, 2014, CMS and ONC 
jointly published a proposed rule titled 
‘‘Medicare and Medicaid Programs; 
Modifications to the Medicare and 
Medicaid Electronic Health Record 
Incentive Programs for 2014; and Health 
Information Technology: Revisions to 
the Certified EHR Technology 
Definition’’ (79 FR 29732). The 
proposed rule proposed to update the 
EHR Incentive Programs Stage 2 and 
Stage 3 participation timeline. It 
proposed to revise the CEHRT definition 
to permit the use of EHR technology 
certified to the 2011 Edition to meet the 
CEHRT definition for FY/CY 2014. It 
also proposed to allow EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs that could not fully 
implement EHR technology certified to 
the 2014 Edition for an EHR reporting 
period in 2014 due to delays in the 
availability of such technology to 
continue to use EHR technology 
certified to the 2011 Edition or a 
combination of EHR technology 
certified to the 2011 Edition and 2014 
Edition for the EHR reporting periods in 
CY 2014 and FY 2014. On September 4, 
2014, a final rule titled ‘‘Medicare and 
Medicaid Programs; Modifications to 
the Medicare and Medicaid Electronic 
Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program 
for 2014 and Other Changes to the EHR 
Incentive Program; and Health 
Information Technology: Revisions to 
the Certified EHR Technology Definition 
and EHR Certification Changes Related 
to Standards’’ (CEHRT Flexibility Final 
Rule) was published (79 FR 52910) 
adopting these proposals. 
On March 30, 2015, the Secretary 
published a proposed rule titled ‘‘2015 
Edition Health Information Technology 
(Health IT) Certification Criteria, 2015 
Edition Base Electronic Health Record 
(EHR) Definition, and ONC Health IT 
Certification Program Modifications’’ 
(80 FR 16804) (2015 Edition Proposed 
Rule). The 2015 Edition Proposed Rule 
proposed revisions to the Certification 
Program with a revised edition of 
certification criteria that was designed 
to enhance interoperability. 
On October 16, 2015, the Secretary 
published a final rule titled ‘‘2015 
Edition Health Information (Health IT) 
Certification Criteria, 2015 Edition Base 
Electronic Health Record (EHR) 
Definition, and ONC Health IT 
Certification Program Modifications’’ 
(80 FR 62602) (2015 Edition Final Rule). 
The 2015 Edition Final Rule established 
a new edition of certification criteria 
(2015 Edition) and a new 2015 Edition 
Base EHR definition. CMS subsequently 
established the 2015 Edition Base EHR 
definition as encompassing the 
minimum capabilities and the related 
minimum standards and 
implementation specifications that 
CEHRT would need to include to 
support the achievement of ‘‘meaningful 
use’’ by eligible clinicians, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs under the Medicare 
and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs 
(the predecessors to the Medicare 
Promoting Interoperability Program and 
the Promoting Interoperability 
performance category under the Merit- 
based Incentive Payment System 
(MIPS)). The final rule also adopted a 
proposal to change the Certification 
Program’s name to the ‘‘ONC Health IT 
Certification Program’’ from the ONC 
HIT Certification Program, modified the 
Certification Program to make it more 
accessible to other types of health IT 
beyond EHR technology and for health 
IT that supports care and practice 
settings beyond the ambulatory and 
inpatient settings, and adopted new and 
revised Principles of Proper Conduct 
(PoPC) for ONC–ACBs. A final rule 
making corrections and clarifications 
was published for the 2015 Edition 
Final Rule (80 FR 76868) on December 
11, 2015, to correct preamble and 
regulatory text errors and clarify 
requirements of the CCDS, the 2015 
Edition privacy and security 
certification framework, and the 
mandatory disclosures for health IT 
developers. 
After issuing a proposed rule on 
March 2, 2016, ‘‘ONC Health IT 
Certification Program: Enhanced 
Oversight and Accountability’’ (81 FR 
11056), we published a final rule by the 
same title (81 FR 72404) (EOA Final 
Rule) on October 19, 2016. The EOA 
Final Rule finalized modifications and 
new requirements under the 
Certification Program, including 
provisions related to our role in the 
Certification Program. The EOA Final 
Rule created a regulatory framework for 
our direct review of health IT certified 
under the Certification Program, 
including, when necessary, requiring 
the correction of non-conformities 
found in health IT certified under the 
Certification Program and suspending 
and terminating certifications issued to 
Complete EHRs and Health IT Modules. 
The final rule also set forth processes for 
us to authorize and oversee accredited 
testing laboratories under the 
Certification Program. In addition, it 
included provisions for expanded 
public availability of certified health IT 
surveillance results. 
On March 4, 2019, the Secretary 
published a proposed rule titled ‘‘21st 
Century Cures Act: Interoperability, 
Information Blocking, and the ONC 
Health IT Certification Program’’ (84 FR

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS260978 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Proposed Rules 7424) (Cures Act Proposed Rule). The 
proposed rule proposed to implement 
certain provisions of the 21st Century 
Cures Act (Cures Act) that would 
advance interoperability and support 
the access, exchange, and use of 
electronic health information. 
On May 1, 2020, the Cures Act Final 
Rule was published in the Federal 
Register (85 FR 25642). The final rule implemented certain provisions of the 
Cures Act, including Conditions and 
Maintenance of Certification 
requirements for health IT developers, 
the voluntary certification of health IT 
for use by pediatric health providers, 
and reasonable and necessary activities 
that do not constitute information 
blocking. The final rule also 
implemented certain parts of the Cures 
Act to support patients’ access to their 
electronic health information (EHI), and 
the implementation of information 
blocking policies that support patient 
electronic access. Additionally, the final 
rule modified the 2015 Edition health IT 
certification criteria and Certification 
Program in other ways to advance 
interoperability, enhance health IT 
certification, and reduce burden and 
costs, as well as to improve patient and 
health care provider access to EHI and 
promote competition. On November 4, 
2020, the Secretary published an 
interim final rule with comment period 
titled ‘‘Information Blocking and the 
ONC Health IT Certification Program: 
Extension of Compliance Dates and 
Timeframes in Response to the COVID– 
19 Public Health Emergency’’ (85 FR 
70064) (Cures Act Interim Final Rule). 
The interim final rule extended certain 
compliance dates and timeframes 
adopted in the Cures Act Final Rule to 
offer the health care system additional 
flexibilities in furnishing services to 
combat the COVID–19 pandemic, 
including extending the applicability 
date for information blocking provisions 
to April 5, 2021. 
On April 18, 2023, the Secretary 
published a proposed rule titled ‘‘Health 
Data, Technology, and Interoperability: 
Certification Program Updates, 
Algorithm Transparency, and 
Information Sharing’’ (88 FR 23746) 
(HTI–1 Proposed Rule). The HTI–1 
Proposed Rule proposed to implement 
the EHR Reporting Program provision of 
the Cures Act by establishing new 
Conditions and Maintenance of 
Certification requirements for health IT 
developers under the Certification 
Program. The HTI–1 Proposed Rule also 
proposed several updates to certification 
criteria and implementation 
specifications recognized by the 
Certification Program, including revised 
certification criteria for: ‘‘clinical 
decision support,’’ ‘‘patient 
demographics and observations,’’ and 
‘‘electronic case reporting.’’ The HTI–1 
Proposed Rule also proposed to 
establish a new baseline version of the 
USCDI. Additionally, the HTI–1 
Proposed Rule also proposed 
enhancements to support information 
sharing under the information blocking 
regulations. 
On January 9, 2024, the Secretary 
issued the ‘‘Health Data, Technology, 
and Interoperability: Certification 
Program Updates, Algorithm 
Transparency, and Information Sharing’’ 
final rule (HTI–1 Final Rule), which 
implemented the EHR Reporting 
Program provision of the 21st Century 
Cures Act and established new 
Conditions and Maintenance of 
Certification requirements for health IT 
developers under the Certification 
Program (89 FR 1192). The HTI–1 Final 
Rule also made several updates to 
certification criteria and standards 
recognized by the Certification Program. 
The Certification Program updates 
included revised certification criteria for 
‘‘decision support interventions’’ (DSIs), 
‘‘patient demographics and 
observations,’’ and ‘‘electronic case 
reporting,’’ as well as adopted a new 
baseline version of the USCDI standard, 
USCDI Version 3 (v3). Additionally, the 
HTI–1 Final Rule provided 
enhancements to support information 
sharing under the information blocking 
regulations. Through these provisions, 
we sought to advance interoperability, 
improve algorithm transparency, and 
support the access, exchange, and use of 
EHI. The HTI–1 Final Rule also updated 
numerous technical standards in the 
Certification Program to advance 
interoperability, enhance health IT 
certification, and reduce burden and 
costs for health IT developers and users 
of health IT. 
On August 5, 2024, the Secretary 
published a proposed rule titled ‘‘Health 
Data, Technology, and Interoperability: 
Patient Engagement, Information 
Sharing, and Public Health 
Interoperability’’ (89 FR 63498) (HTI–2 
Proposed Rule). The HTI–2 Proposed 
Rule sought to advance interoperability, 
improve transparency, and support the 
access, exchange, and use of EHI 
through proposals for: standards 
adoption; adoption of certification 
criteria to advance public health data 
exchange; expanded uses of certified 
APIs, such as for electronic prior 
authorization, patient access, care 
management, and care coordination; 
and information sharing under the 
information blocking regulations. 
Additionally, the HTI–2 Proposed Rule 
proposed to establish a new baseline 
version of the USCDI standard and 
proposed to update the Certification 
Program to enhance interoperability and 
optimize certification processes to 
reduce burden and costs. The HTI–2 
Proposed Rule also proposed to 
implement certain provisions related to 
TEFCA, which would support the 
reliability, privacy, security, and trust 
within TEFCA. 
On December 16, 2024, the Secretary 
issued the ‘‘Health Data, Technology, 
and Interoperability: Trusted Exchange 
Framework and Common Agreement 
(TEFCA)’’ final rule (89 FR 101772) 
(HTI–2 Final Rule) which implemented 
advancements to interoperability, 
improved transparency, and supported 
the access, exchange, and use of 
electronic health information. The HTI– 
2 Final Rule codified definitions of 
certain TEFCA terms in § 171.401 of the 
information blocking regulations and 
finalized the 45 CFR part 172 TEFCA 
provisions. 
On December 17, 2024, the Secretary 
issued the ‘‘Health Data, Technology, 
and Interoperability: Protecting Care 
Access’’ final rule (89 FR 102512) (HTI– 
3 Final Rule). The HTI–3 Final Rule 
finalized certain proposals from the 
HTI–2 Proposed Rule to support the 
access, exchange, and use of EHI. The 
final rule amended the information 
blocking regulations to revise two 
existing information blocking 
exceptions and established an 
additional reasonable and necessary 
activity that does not constitute 
information blocking referred to as the 
Protecting Care Access Exception. 
On July 31, 2025, ASTP/ONC 
finalized the ‘‘Health Data, Technology, 
and Interoperability: Electronic 
Prescribing, Real-Time Prescription 
Benefit and Electronic Prior 
Authorization’’ final rule (90 FR 37130) 
(HTI–4 Final Rule), as a part of the 
FY2026 IPPS/LTCH PPS Final Rule, 
published by CMS on August 4, 2025 
(90 FR 36536). The HTI–4 Final Rule 
finalized a limited subset of the 
proposals in the HTI–2 Proposed Rule 
(89 FR 63498) and focused on 
improving care delivery and reducing 
administrative burden through the 
exchange of clinical and administrative 
information. The HTI–4 Final Rule 
updated the ONC Health IT Certification 
Program to add several new certification 
criteria that advance health care 
providers’ ability to engage in electronic 
prescribing, real-time prescription 
benefit checks, and electronic prior 
authorization.

III. Health Information Technology 
Standards, Implementation 
Specifications, and Certification 
Criteria and Certification Programs for 
Health Information Technology (Part 
170) 
Reading This Proposed Rule 
In this preamble, we present our 
proposals in an order that begins with 
the certification criteria we propose to 
remove and subsequently the standards, 
definitions, and other related 
Certification Program provisions 
proposed for removal or revision. This 
approach should make it easier for 
readers to follow our proposed 
Certification Program removals, in part, 
due to the natural cascading effects of 
proposing to remove or revise a 
certification criterion. For example, we 
propose to remove the ‘‘application 
access—all data request’’ certification 
criterion in 45 CFR 170.315(g)(9), the 
referenced HL7 CDA R2 Implementation 
Guide: C–CDA Templates for Clinical 
Notes R2.1 Companion guide, Release 
2–US Realm, October 2019 (45 CFR 
170.205(a)(5)), and the ‘‘application 
access—all data request’’ certification 
criterion from the Base EHR definition. 
In some cases, we propose to remove a 
standard consistent with a certification 
criterion transition period until January 
1, 2027. In very limited circumstances, 
we retain a standard that is cross- 
referenced in a certification criterion 
that we propose to remove. We do this 
because the standard is cross-referenced 
in another criterion and/or supports 
health IT interoperability alignment. For 
example, although we propose to 
remove the ‘‘transport methods and 
other protocols’’ certification criteria in 
§ 170.315(h), we propose to retain the 
Direct Project transport standard 
adopted in § 170.202(a)(2) because we 
believe keeping the primary Direct 
Project standard would acknowledge the 
current utilization of the Direct 
standard, while removing the 
certification criteria in § 170.315(h) 
recognizes the ongoing technological 
advancements related to transport, 
including movement toward FHIR-based 
standards, and would encourage and 
provide space for further innovation and 
market competition in this area. We also 
propose to remove the certification 
criteria in § 170.315(h) from the ‘‘Base 
EHR’’ definition. Additionally, we 
solely propose to remove standards 
when they are no longer referenced by 
existing certification criteria. Further, as 
noted above, we propose to remove 
certain Conditions and Maintenance of 
Certification requirements and other 
Certification Program requirements. 
RFI Feedback 
Recently, the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB), the Department, and 
CMS–ASTP/ONC issued requests for 
information (RFIs) related to 
deregulation. We reviewed comments 
related to ASTP/ONC. In response to the 
CMS–ASTP/ONC Request for 
Information; Health Technology 
Ecosystem (90 FR 21034) (CMS–ASTP/ 
ONC RFI), commenters expressed a 
strong desire to modernize the 
Certification Program to be more 
modular, API-focused, and less centered 
on specific EHR functionalities. 
Commenters recommended simplifying 
the process, reducing costs, and 
expanding certification requirements to 
ensure payers and other health IT 
systems adhere to the same 
interoperability standards. There was an 
overwhelming demand to strengthen, 
expand, and mandate the use of FHIR- 
based APIs. Commenters strongly 
advocated for retiring outdated, less 
efficient standards to reduce 
complexity. A central theme from 
commenters was the need for regulatory 
modernization to reduce administrative 
and financial burdens on providers and 
technology developers. Commenters 
also expressed concern that existing 
certification requirements are often too 
rigid, costly, and not aligned with 
emerging care models like value-based 
care or specialized technologies such as 
AI and remote monitoring. A 
commenter that responded to the HHS 
RFI expressed concerns with the Real 
World Testing and Insights Conditions 
of Certification, stating that the 
requirements are overly burdensome 
and offer limited value to providers or 
patients. The commenter also 
recommended retiring low-value 
certification criteria requirements that 
add complexity without improving care. 
A commenter that responded to the 
OMB RFI suggested that revisions could 
be made to the Conditions and 
Maintenance of Certification 
requirements that focus on streamlined 
and meaningful oversight without 
placing undue demands on developers, 
especially where those demands offer 
limited direct benefit to health care 
provider customers or their patients. 
The commenter also suggested the 
removal of ‘‘non-interoperability- 
focused, redundant, or valueless’’ 
criteria and focus on promoting 
standardized and scalable 
interoperability. ASTP/ONC addresses a 
number of these comments in the 
proposals below, specifically the 
suggestions to remove non- 
interoperability-focused and redundant 
certification criteria. Commenters were 
strongly supportive of our focus on 
FHIR-based standards. Some 
commenters, however, included 
suggestions related to new regulatory 
actions. These suggestions are out of 
scope for this proposed deregulatory 
rule, but we may consider the 
suggestions for a future rulemaking. 
A. Certification Criteria for Health 
Information Technology 
In this proposed rule we have 
identified certification criteria for 
removal or revision. For some of the 
criteria below, we justify removing the 
certification criteria because they have 
been ‘‘widely adopted’’ or ‘‘widely 
implemented.’’ To determine if the 
certification criterion is ‘‘widely 
adopted’’ or ‘‘widely implemented,’’ we 
considered whether and for how long 
the certification criterion has been 
included in the Base EHR definition in 
§ 170.102, or the Certified Electronic 
Health Record Technology (CEHRT) 
definitions established by CMS in 42 
CFR 495.4 and 414.1305. The CEHRT 
definitions incorporate the Base EHR 
definition and may also incorporate 
certification criteria necessary to report 
applicable objectives and measures 
under the Medicare Promoting 
Interoperability (PI) Program or the 
Promoting Interoperability performance 
category in the Merit-based Incentive 
Payment System (MIPS), certification 
criteria determined applicable for an 
Alternative Payment Model (APM), and 
other certification criteria as specified. 
To participate in the Promoting 
Interoperability Program and the MIPS 
Promoting Interoperability performance 
category, eligible hospitals, CAHs, and 
eligible clinicians must use CEHRT as 
specified by the applicable definition. In 
addition, CEHRT is required for the 
purposes of determinations under 42 
CFR 414.1415 and 414.1420 regarding 
Advanced APM status. ASTP/ONC 
tracks and publishes data on the 
adoption and use of health IT, including 
CEHRT, by US hospitals and office- 
based physicians. Our most recent 
survey data from 2021 shows that 96 
percent of hospitals and 78 percent of 
physicians reported having a certified 
EHR.
13
As discussed in more detail 
below, we provide this analysis and 
consider certain certification criteria as 
‘‘widely adopted’’ or ‘‘widely 
implemented’’ because they are 
included in the Base EHR or CEHRT 
definitions and adopted by 96 and 78

1. Clinical Certification Criteria 
a. Patient Demographics 
In the 2014 Edition Final Rule, we 
included ‘‘demographics’’ in the Base 
EHR definition in § 170.102 (77 FR 
54265). We noted that including 
demographics in the Base EHR 
definition aligns with the statutory 
‘‘Qualified EHR’’ definition and is 
intended to facilitate the recording, 
capture, and access to a patient’s 
demographic data. In the 2015 Edition 
Final Rule (80 FR 62602), we added the 
requirement to record, capture, and 
access a patient’s sex, sexual 
orientation, and gender identity for 
Health IT Modules certified to the 
demographics’ certification criterion 
(§ 170.315(a)(5)) (80 FR 62747). The 
2015 Edition Final Rule also defined a 
required set of standardized terminology 
to represent each of these data elements 
(80 FR 62618 through 62620). 
In the HTI–1 Final Rule (89 FR 1428), 
we adopted USCDI v3, which includes 
data elements for Sex, Sexual 
Orientation, and Gender Identity. To 
ensure consistent capture of these data 
elements across health IT, we made 
updates to the data elements in 
§ 170.315(a)(5) to incorporate the newly 
adopted data elements in USCDI v3. 
Specifically, these same data elements 
were adopted as ‘‘sex’’ 
(§ 170.315(a)(5)(i)(C)), ‘‘sexual 
orientation’’ (§ 170.315(a)(5)(i)(D)), and 
‘‘gender identity’’ (§ 170.315(a)(5)(i)(E)). 
To ensure consistency with our 
adoption of USCDI v3, we finalized the 
name change of the certification 
criterion in § 170.315(a)(5) from 
‘‘demographics’’ to ‘‘patient 
demographics and observations’’ due to 
the inclusion of data elements based on 
clinical observations. 
Additionally, in the HTI–1 Final Rule, 
we finalized the replacement of the 
specific concepts referenced in 
§ 170.315(a)(5)(i)(D) and (E), sexual 
orientation and gender identity, 
respectively, with the SNOMED Clinical 
Terms U.S. Edition (SNOMED CT

§ 170.315(a)(5)(C), sex, we finalized 
adoption that a Health IT Module enable 
sex to be recorded in accordance with 
the standard specified in § 170.207(n)(1) 
for the period up to and including 
December 31, 2025; or § 170.207(n)(2). 
The standards specified in 
§ 170.207(n)(1) (sex) require that birth 
sex must be coded in accordance with 
HL7

Version 3 Standard, Value Sets for 
AdministrativeGender and NullFlavor, 
up until the adoption of this standard 
expires January 1, 2026, attributed as 
follows: (i) Male. M; (ii) Female. F; (iii) 
Unknown. NullFlavor UNK. The code 
sets referenced in § 170.207(n)(1), as 
cross-referenced in § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(C), 
would expire on January 1, 2026, but we 
also stated that health IT developers 
could continue to use the specific codes 
referenced in § 170.207(n)(1) through 
December 31, 2025, to provide adequate 
time for Health IT Modules certified to 
the relevant certification criteria to 
transition to the updated terminology 
standards. Lastly, we finalized the 
addition of ‘‘sex parameter for clinical 
use’’ as a new data element in 
§ 170.315(a)(5)(i)(F), ‘‘name to use’’ in 
§ 170.315(a)(5)(i)(G), and ‘‘pronouns’’ in 
§ 170.315(a)(5)(i)(H). 
After publication of the HTI–1 Final 
Rule and our adoption of the revisions 
in § 170.315(a)(5), we began exercising 
enforcement discretion and issued 
certification guidance for the 
Certification Program regarding Health 
IT Module conformance with certain 
data elements in the patient 
demographics and observations 
certification criterion.
14
In our 
enforcement discretion notice, we 
explained that § 170.550 requires an 
ONC–ACB, when certifying Health IT 
Modules, to certify in accordance with 
the applicable certification criteria 
adopted in regulation. Under this 
enforcement discretion and certification 
guidance, we noted that ASTP/ONC will 
not take any enforcement action under 
§ 170.565 against an ONC–ACB based 
on non-compliance with § 170.550 for 
certifying a Health IT Module that is 
presented for certification to the patient 
demographics and observations 
certification criterion (§ 170.315(a)(5)) 
where the Health IT Module does not 
demonstrate conformance with any or 
all of the following data and 
observations in paragraph (a)(5)(i): sex 
parameter for clinical use, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, name to 
use, and pronouns; or does not 
demonstrate conformance with any or 
all of data and observations in 
§ 170.315(a)(5)(i)(D) through (H). We 
also stated that ASTP/ONC will not take 
action against Health IT Modules 
certifying or currently certified to the 
patient demographics and observations 
certification criterion in § 170.315(a)(5) 
that only demonstrate, for conformance 
with paragraph (a)(5)(i)(C) (sex), that it 
can record sex in accordance with either 
the standard specified in § 170.207(n)(1) 
for the period up to and including 
December 31, 2025, or the SNOMED 
CT

U.S. Edition codes found in the 
standard specified in § 170.207(n)(2): 
248152002 Female (finding) and 
248153007 Male (finding).
15
We noted 
that we would not exercise our direct 
review authority under § 170.580 for 
any non-conformity, potential or actual, 
that arises solely from a Health IT 
Module not demonstrating the 
capabilities specified in our 
enforcement discretion notice. We 
stated that the enforcement discretion 
and certification guidance will remain 
in effect for 12 months from the date of 
the notice or until the Department 
completes a regulatory action to revise 
the applicable regulations, whichever 
comes first. 
We have reviewed the requirements 
in § 170.315(a)(5)(i) and have 
determined that removal of certain 
requirements in § 170.315(a)(5)(i) would 
result in burden reduction for health IT 
developers and cost savings associated 
with the (1) enforcement discretion and 
(2) ongoing maintenance costs affected 
by the proposed updates to the 
certification criterion. Accordingly, for 
these reasons and reasons discussed 
below, we propose the following 
revisions to § 170.315(a)(5)(i). 
We propose to revise 
§ 170.315(a)(5)(i)(C) to remove the 
reference to the standard in 
§ 170.207(n)(1) (HL7 Administrative 
Gender and NullFlavor). As discussed 
above, in the HTI–1 Final Rule, we 
finalized that the adoption of the code 
sets referenced in § 170.207(n)(1) will 
expire on January 1, 2026. Beginning 
January 1, 2026, a Health IT Module 
certified to § 170.315(a)(5) is required to 
demonstrate, for conformance with 
paragraph (a)(5)(i)(C), that it can record 
sex in accordance with the SNOMED 
CT

U.S. Edition codes found in the 
standard specified in § 170.207(n)(2). 
Given the timing of publication of this 
proposed rule, the reference to 
§ 170.207(n)(1) in § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(C) is 
outdated and no longer relevant. 
Therefore, we propose to remove the 
cross-reference to § 170.207(n)(1) in 
§ 170.315(a)(5)(i)(C) because retaining 
the reference may cause confusion for 
interested parties. Our proposed 
revision would keep the cross-reference 
to § 170.207(n)(2) in 
§ 170.315(a)(5)(i)(C). We propose that to 
demonstrate conformance with 
§ 170.315(a)(5), a Health IT Module 
would only need to demonstrate that it 
can record sex in accordance with either 
the 248152002 Female (finding) or 
248153007 Male (finding) SNOMED 
CT

U.S. Edition codes found in the 
standard specified in § 170.207(n)(2). A 
Health IT Module would not need to 
demonstrate that it can record sex with 
any other code found in SNOMED CT

 
U.S. Edition. 
We have reviewed and evaluated the 
data elements in § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(D) 
through (H) for consistency with our 
overall deregulatory approach, and we 
have determined that it is no longer 
necessary to include the paragraphs 
specified in § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(D) through 
(H) (i.e., patient observations data) as part of the Certification Program. As 
part of this evaluation, we considered 
the general statutory requirement of the 
Qualified EHR definition (further 
implemented with the ‘‘Base EHR’’ 
definition in § 170.102) to capture 
patient demographics, which neither 
identifies demographic data elements 
nor requires certain demographic 
elements to be included in the 
definition. The removal of these 
elements would reduce burden by 
narrowing how many data elements are 
required for purposes of certification to 
the criterion and for meeting the Base 
EHR definition. This would produce 
cost savings for developers regulated 
under the Certification Program. Health 
IT developers would no longer need to 
support these data elements as part of 
the voluntary certification process 
including not only for initial 
certification but also for ongoing 
maintenance requirements over time. In 
this regard, we invite readers to review 
section VIII (Regulatory Impact 
Analysis) for a detailed discussion of 
our estimated impacts and cost savings 
associated with our proposed revisions 
in § 170.315(a)(5)(i). In addition, the 
observational data elements proposed 
for removal do not support the meeting 
of specific measures under the Medicare 
Promoting Interoperability Program and 
the MIPS Promoting Interoperability 
performance category, and therefore, are 
not essential for inclusion in certified 
health IT that is used to meet the 
CEHRT definitions and support meeting 
measures under those programs. Lastly, 
we note that the proposed removal of 
the data elements in § 170.315(a)(5)(i)(D) 
through (H) aligns with our proposal

related to the removal of data elements 
from USCDI v3 and reflected in 
proposed USCDI v3.1 (see section 
III.B.1). 
We propose a conforming name 
change of the certification criterion from 
‘‘patient demographics and 
observations’’ to ‘‘patient 
demographics.’’ This revision is not a 
substantive change to certification 
requirements, but would return the 
certification criterion’s naming 
convention to as it was prior to the HTI– 
1 Final Rule, as well as acknowledge 
that the data described in § 170.315(a)(5) 
is understood to be demographic 
information. We note that our proposed 
revisions are limited to 
§ 170.315(a)(5)(i), and we do not 
propose to revise the ‘‘inpatient setting 
only’’ requirements in 
§ 170.315(a)(5)(ii). We welcome 
comments on these proposals. 
b. Clinical Decision Support 
We propose to remove the ‘‘clinical 
decision support’’ (CDS) certification 
criterion and reserve § 170.315(a)(9). 
In 2012, we established a new set of 
requirements for Health IT Modules to 
support CDS. These requirements 
included capabilities to support 
evidence-based CDS based on a defined 
set of data elements; CDS configuration 
for both inpatient and ambulatory 
settings; and the display of source 
attribute or bibliographic citation of 
CDS (77 FR 54212). In the 2015 Edition 
Final Rule, we finalized an updated 
CDS certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(a)(9) (80 FR 62622). In the 
HTI–1 Proposed Rule, we noted our 
belief that the continued evolution of 
decision support software, especially as 
it relates to AI or machine learning- 
driven Predictive DSIs, necessitates new 
requirements for the Certification 
Program’s CDS certification criterion (88 
FR 23781). 
In the HTI–1 Final Rule, we finalized 
an expiration date of January 1, 2025, 
for the CDS certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(a)(9) and incorporate certain 
policies with modifications in the 
‘‘decision support intervention’’ 
certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(11) 
(89 FR 1237). We finalized a conforming 
expiration date for the CDS certification 
criterion in the Base EHR definition in 
§ 170.102. We noted that no action is 
required for developers relating to the 
expiration of § 170.315(a)(9) in the Base 
EHR. However, we also noted that 
developers with Health IT Modules 
certified to § 170.315(a)(9) wishing to 
maintain certification to the Base EHR 
definition, needed to update to the DSI 
certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(11) 
by December 31, 2024. 
As of January 1, 2025, the CDS 
certification criterion in § 170.315(a)(9) 
is no longer available in the 
Certification Program. Therefore, we 
propose to remove and reserve 
§ 170.315(a)(9). This proposal would be 
effective upon the effective date of a 
subsequent final rule. We welcome 
feedback on this proposal. 
c. Family Health History 
We propose to remove the ‘‘family 
health history’’ certification criterion 
and reserve § 170.315(a)(12). Health IT 
Modules certified to § 170.315(a)(12) 
must enable a user to record, change, 
and access a patient’s family health 
history in accordance with the familial 
concepts or expressions included in, at 
a minimum, the version of the standard 
in § 170.207(a)(1) (SNOMED CT

, U.S. 
Edition, March 2022 Release). This 
certification criterion is not included in 
the Base EHR definition but is included 
in the CEHRT definitions established by 
CMS for the Medicare Promoting 
Interoperability Program (42 CFR 495.4) 
and the MIPS Promoting 
Interoperability performance category 
(42 CFR 414.1305). 
We adopted the family health history 
certification criterion in the 2015 
Edition Final Rule as a revised iteration 
of the 2014 Edition family health history 
certification criterion adopted in 
§ 170.314(a)(13) (80 FR 62624). In the 
2014 Edition Proposed Rule, we 
proposed the first iteration of the family 
health history certification criterion to 
align with a Meaningful Use Stage 2 
proposal (77 FR 13838). We solicited 
comment on whether we should adopt 
the HL7 Pedigree standard and/or the 
Systematized Nomenclature of 
Medicine—Clinical Terms (SNOMED 
CT

U.S. Edition) terms for familial 
conditions. We also sought comment on 
a tool produced by the HHS Office of 
the Surgeon General for capturing 
family health histories. In the 2014 
Edition Final Rule, we finalized a 
certification criterion that required, at a 
minimum, that health IT must enable a 
user to record, change, and access 
information about a patient’s first degree 
relative within the said patient’s record 
(see also 77 FR 54174). We also 
finalized that health IT certified to 
§ 170.314(a)(13) could meet this 
certification criterion by either being 
able to capture a patient’s family health 
history in SNOMED CT

U.S. Edition or 
in the HL7 Pedigree standard. We noted 
that because the use of SNOMED CT

 
U.S. Edition was required for meeting 
several other certification criteria, it 
would not be a challenge to meet the 
certification criterion. In the 2015 
Edition Proposed Rule, we proposed 
two separate certification criteria for 
family health history—one based on 
functionality according to the SNOMED 
CT

U.S. Edition standard and one 
based on functionality according to the 
HL7 Pedigree standard (80 FR 16822 
through 16823). However, we only 
adopted the family health history 
certification criterion (§ 170.315(a)(12)) 
based on SNOMED CT

U.S. Edition, 
stating that the functionality should be 
available to providers for more 
comprehensive patient care (80 FR 
62624). 
In light of our overall deregulatory 
approach, we have determined that we 
should remove the family health history 
certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(a)(12). The functionality of 
this certification criterion has been part 
of the Certification Program and 
associated with the Medicare Promoting 
Interoperability Program and the MIPS 
Promoting Interoperability performance 
category (including prior iterations such 
as the EHR Incentives Programs and the 
CEHRT definitions) for over 12 years. As 
such, the functionality is embedded in 
certified health IT and has been widely 
adopted by hospitals and physicians 
due to participation in those 
programs.
16
Further, similar to what we 
stated when we adopted the 
certification criterion, the ability to code 
to SNOMED

CT U.S. Edition 
(including the entire adopted version) is 
required to meet many of the remaining 
certification criteria, including those 
referencing the USCDI v3 and those 
criteria that would include the proposed 
USCDI v3.1 standard.
17
These 
certification criteria included criteria 
that are in the Base EHR definition and 
not proposed for removal in this 
proposed rule. Therefore, we expect that 
many developers of certified health IT 
will still conform to the SNOMED CT

 
U.S. Edition and the functionality to 
code family health history with 
SNOMED CT

U.S. Edition will remain 
in certified health IT adopted by 
hospitals and physicians. Moreover, 
USCDI v6 includes a new Family Health 
History data element.
18
We note that 
health IT developers can use the SVAP 
to voluntarily implement and become 
certified using the most recent National 
Coordinator-approved version of USCDI 
without waiting for ASTP/ONC to 
require that newer version via 
rulemaking (85 FR 25669). While USCDI 
v6 has not been adopted in regulation at

this time, our expectations, as with 
every prior version of USCDI, are that 
USCDI v6 would go through the SVAP 
approval process and be approved for 
SVAP certification in 2026. 
As noted above, the family health 
history certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(a)(12) is included in the 
CEHRT definitions. Therefore, to 
provide sufficient time for CMS to 
update the CEHRT definitions to remove 
reference to the certification criterion, 
we propose a January 1, 2027, effective 
date for the removal of this certification 
criterion. We welcome comments on 
these proposals. 
d. Implantable Device List 
We propose to remove and reserve the 
‘‘implantable device list’’ certification 
criterion in § 170.315(a)(14). The 
implantable device list certification 
criterion requires Health IT Modules 
certified to § 170.315(a)(14) to exchange, 
record, and allow a user to access a list 
of Unique Device Identifiers 
(UDIs) associated with a patient’s 
implantable devices. There is no 
adopted standard or implementation 
guide associated with this functionality. 
However, the implantable device list 
certification criterion is included in the 
Base EHR definition, and we propose a 
conforming revision in § 170.102 to 
remove § 170.315(a)(14) from the Base 
EHR definition (please see section 
III.C.1 of this proposed rule). 
In the 2015 Edition Final Rule, we 
adopted § 170.315(a)(14) with the 
purpose of establishing a baseline 
functionality to support the exchange 
and use of UDIs in certified health IT 
(80 FR 62748). We explained that the 
need to exchange and have access to 
this information wherever patients seek 
care is broadly relevant to all clinical 
users of health IT, regardless of setting 
or specialty, so that they may know 
what devices their patients are using (or 
have used) and thereby prevent device- 
related adverse events and deliver safe 
and effective care (80 FR 62625 through 
62627). We also stated that this need is 
most acute for implantable devices, 
which by their nature are difficult to 
detect and identify in the absence of 
reliable clinical documentation. 
We acknowledged the challenges of 
fully implementing UDIs in health IT in 
the 2015 Edition Final Rule, yet 
believed our adoption of the 
certification criterion, as well as 
including the certification criterion in 
the 2015 Base EHR definition and a UDI 
data element in the 2015 CCDS 
definition, were important steps to 
support electronic exchange and use of 
UDIs (80 FR 62625 through 62626). In 
responding to comments on the 2015 
Edition Proposed Rule, we recognized 
that fully implementing UDIs in health 
IT will take time and require addressing 
a number of challenges, so we adopted 
a certification criterion that focused 
narrowly on baseline health IT 
capabilities that developers could 
feasibly implement. We stated that these 
capabilities would provide the 
foundation for broader adoption and 
more advanced capabilities and use 
cases. This approach minimized the 
potential burden while maximizing the 
impact of this certification criterion for 
all stakeholders. 
We have reviewed the implantable 
device list certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(a)(14) and, as explained 
below, have determined that we have 
achieved our policy goals associated 
with the exchange and use of UDIs. In 
consideration of this outcome and our 
overall regulatory goals to reduce 
burden and offer flexibility to both 
health IT developers and health care 
providers, we propose to remove the 
implantable device list certification 
criterion and reserve § 170.315(a)(14). 
First, we have achieved our stated 
policy goal of broad adoption of 
§ 170.315(a)(14). As we explained in 
prior rulemakings, we believe in a 
foundational approach as the first step 
to broader adoption of health IT 
capabilities (80 FR 16824, 80 FR 62626). 
We added the implantable device list 
certification criterion to the 2015 
Edition Base EHR definition in the 2015 
Edition Final Rule. The Base EHR 
definition (2015 Edition and subsequent 
versions) is part of the CEHRT 
definitions under the Medicare 
Promoting Interoperability Program and 
the MIPS Promoting Interoperability 
performance category.
19
As such, health 
care providers participating in these 
programs are required to adopt health IT 
certified to the implantable device list 
certification criterion. As discussed 
earlier in this preamble, survey data 
indicates widespread adoption by 
hospitals and physicians of certified 
health IT products meeting the Base 
EHR definition, which includes Health 
IT Modules certified to the implantable 
device list certification criterion.
20
The 
widespread adoption of the implantable 
device list functionality is now well- 
established in health IT products, and 
we do not believe that removing the 
certification criterion from the 
Certification Program will result in 
health IT developers removing the 
functionality from their products, which 
would likely be both a costly endeavor 
and counter to the interests of their 
customers (i.e., hospitals and physicians). 
Second, our proposed removal of the 
implantable device list certification 
criterion would reduce burden and 
costs. We have historically, where 
feasible and appropriate, taken 
measures to reduce burden within the 
Certification Program and make the 
Certification Program more effective, 
flexible, and streamlined. We believe 
our proposal to remove the implantable 
device list certification criterion would 
result in reduced burden, increased 
flexibility, and cost savings. Developers 
of certified heath IT would have the 
flexibility to implement those 
functionalities supporting the exchange 
and use of UDIs that best meet the needs 
of their clients without additional 
regulatory burden, which could also 
lead to innovations in these and related 
functionalities. 
Third, support for UDIs within 
certified health IT is incorporated into 
other Certification Program elements 
besides the implantable device list 
certification criterion. For example, 
UDIs are a required data element in 
USCDI v3, and the proposed USCDI v3.1 
standard, as the ‘‘Unique Device 
Identifier(s) for a patient’s implantable 
device(s)’’ data element. We believe 
retaining a functional data capture 
certification criterion that requires the 
same information as the USCDI v3 
standard supports (as part of key criteria 
enabling health information exchange) 
would be duplicative and unnecessary 
(we refer readers to section III.B.1 of this 
proposed rule for a discussion on the 
proposed USCDI v3.1). 
We also note that in USCDI v6, 
published in July 2025, we adopted a 
significantly modified definition of the 
UDI data element to include non- 
implantable devices.
21
Health IT 
developers can use SVAP to voluntarily 
implement and become certified using 
the most recent National Coordinator- 
approved version of USCDI without 
waiting for ONC to require that newer 
version via rulemaking (85 FR 25669). 
While USCDI v6 has not been adopted 
in regulation at this time, our 
expectations, as with every prior version 
of USCDI, are that USCDI v6 would go 
through the SVAP approval process and 
be approved for SVAP certification in 
2026. 
Therefore, we believe that some 
health IT developers may choose to 
voluntarily update relevant certified 
Health IT Modules to utilize USCDI v6

data element. Such actions would 
provide for new data exchange 
capabilities to expand beyond the 
baseline functionality in 
§ 170.315(a)(14). This proposal, if 
finalized, would be effective as of the 
effective date of a subsequent final rule. 
We welcome comments on this 
proposal. 
2. Care Coordination Certification 
Criteria 
a. Transitions of Care 
We propose to revise the ‘‘transitions 
of care’’ certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(b)(1) to simplify its 
requirements, with an effective date of 
January 1, 2027. We propose to reduce 
the scope of the criterion to focus on 
enabling the receipt of a Consolidated 
CDA (C–CDA) document as a way to 
position this criterion for a future 
evolution to receipt of FHIR-formatted 
data. The transitions of care criterion 
supports the structured transition of 
care summaries and referral summaries 
that help ensure continuity and care 
coordination as patients move between 
providers. In the 2014 Edition Final 
Rule, we finalized adoption of the C– 
CDA standard for this criterion because 
it accommodated formatting of a 
summary care record that included all 
of the data elements that CMS proposed 
be available for inclusion in a summary 
care record (77 FR 54217). We also 
stressed that an EHR technology’s 
ability to incorporate data for 
medications, medication allergies, and 
problems in structured form from a C– 
CDA document was the minimum 
necessary to meet this certification 
criterion and encouraged EHR 
technology developers to go beyond this 
minimum (77 FR 54219). Additionally, 
in the 2014 Edition Final Rule we 
included § 170.315(b)(1) in the Base 
EHR definition (77 FR 54265). 
In the Cures Act Final Rule, we 
updated the transitions of care 
criterion’s data requirements to include 
USCDI v1 (85 FR 25667), and in the 
HTI–1 Final Rule we updated the data 
requirements to include USCDI v3 (89 
FR 1298). We note that the certification 
criterion in § 170.315(b)(1) is currently 
associated with several measures under 
the Health Information Exchange 
Objective of the Medicare Promoting 
Interoperability Program and the MIPS 
Promoting Interoperability performance 
category. Specifically, the certification 
criterion in § 170.315(b)(1) is specified 
as required for the Support Electronic 
Referral Loops by Sending Health 
Information and Support Electronic 
Referral Loops by Receiving and 
Reconciling Health Information 
measures and specified as an example of 
a criterion that may be used to support 
the actions of the Health Information 
Exchange (HIE) Bi-directional Exchange 
and Enabling Exchange under TEFCA 
measures.
22
 
We have reviewed and evaluated the 
transitions of care certification criterion 
in § 170.315(b)(1) in order to identify 
ways to reduce burden while still 
supporting our policy goals. As we 
noted in the S&CC January 2010 Interim 
Final Rule, we take an iterative 
approach to addressing the 
interoperability of health IT and 
consider factors such as maturity, 
market prevalence, and complexity of 
implementation to inform our adoption 
of standards and certification criteria 
(75 FR 2020). Our approach then and 
now is intended to be ‘‘pragmatic, but 
forward looking’’ and involves 
sustainable and incremental steps to 
harmonize current and future standards, 
as well as phase out standards and 
certification criteria when needed (75 
FR 2021). 
Several industry trends have led us to 
propose revising this certification 
criterion. First, FHIR supports the 
functionalities of a contemporary web- 
based architecture, using technologies 
such as RESTful APIs, JSON, and XML, 
making the standard more approachable 
to software developers and enabling 
easier integration with web-based and 
mobile applications than the C–CDA 
standard. Second, FHIR is a more 
granular data standard, enabling 
exchange of more discrete data concepts 
rather than entire documents. C–CDA is 
a document-centric standard that does 
not support retrieval of information at 
the data element level, which can lead 
to information overload during 
transitions of care. Finally, we believe 
that FHIR supports easier scalability to 
support real-time data exchange, which 
will support a broader ecosystem of 
health IT tools than C–CDA. Various 
capabilities, such as CDS Hooks, 
Subscriptions, and SMART Health 
Links, support new interoperability 
paradigms that are much more difficult 
to do using C–CDA. These trends 
notwithstanding, we remain cognizant 
that the C–CDA standard is widely 
adopted, and we anticipate its 
continued use over the near-term, 
especially for transitions of care among 
health care delivery settings, such as in- 
patient and long-term and post-acute 
care. 
In detail, we propose to revise the 
transitions of care certification criterion 
in § 170.315(b)(1) as of January 1, 2027. 
We propose to remove the requirements 
in § 170.315(b)(1)(i) ‘‘send and receive 
via edge protocol’’ and in 
§ 170.315(b)(1)(iii) ‘‘create’’ and to 
simplify the requirements in 
§ 170.315(b)(1)(ii) ‘‘validate and 
display’’ to focus on the ability to 
receive and validate C–CDA documents. 
We propose to remove the requirements 
in § 170.315(b)(1)(ii)(B) and (C). We also 
propose to move the requirements in 
§ 170.315(b)(1)(ii)(A) ‘‘validate C–CDA 
conformance—system performance’’ to 
§ 170.315(b)(1)(i) and to rename 
§ 170.315(b)(1) to read ‘‘transitions of 
care—receive and validate.’’ 
Additionally, in § 170.315(b)(1)(ii)(A) 
we propose to remove the references to 
§ 170.205(a)(3) and to replace the 
references to § 170.205(a)(5), which 
expires on January 1, 2026, with 
references to § 170.205(a)(6). We 
welcome feedback on these proposals. 
b. Clinical Information Reconciliation 
and Incorporation 
We propose to remove the ‘‘clinical 
information reconciliation and 
incorporation’’ certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(b)(2) with an effective date of 
January 1, 2027, and to reserve that 
section. The clinical information 
reconciliation and incorporation (CIRI) 
certification criterion allows health care 
providers to reconcile and incorporate 
patient health information sent from 
external sources to maintain a more 
accurate and up-to-date patient record. 
The CIRI certification criterion is not 
currently included in the Base EHR 
definition; however, the criterion is 
required for the Support Electronic 
Referral Loops by Receiving and 
Reconciling Health Information measure 
and specified as an example of a 
criterion that may be used to support 
the actions of the HIE Bi-Directional 
Exchange and Enabling Exchange under 
TEFCA measures in the Medicare 
Promoting Interoperability Program and 
the MIPS Promoting Interoperability 
performance category.

Real World Testing results (accessible via 
https://chpl.healthit.gov/) for 2024 from three large 
EHR developers with significant market share in the 
United States attest to routine clinician use of 
Clinical Information Reconciliation and 
Incorporation (§ 170.315(b)(2)): Epic customers 
reconciled 66 million medications, 7 million 
allergies, and 40 million problems out of 135 
million transition of care CCDs received; Oracle 
Health clinicians added 491 k and rejected 2.69 
million external medications per month, evidencing 
active review; and MEDITECH’s Expanse product 
processed 17 million CCD Retrieve Document Set 
exchanges with a 99.67% success rate. Given that 
Epic, Oracle (Cerner), and MEDITECH together 
provide the majority of EHR systems used in the 
U.S., these findings indicate that CIRI capabilities 
are broadly adopted and meaningfully used in 
clinical care.

electronically complete medication 
reconciliation of two or more 
medication lists (75 FR 2046). In the 
2011 Edition Final Rule, we revised the 
certification criterion to require that 
Certified EHR Technology be capable of 
providing a user with the ability to 
electronically compare two or more 
medication lists (75 FR 44613). We 
expanded these requirements in the 
2014 Edition Final Rule to require 
clinical information reconciliation for 
problems, medications, and medication 
allergies (77 FR 54289). In the 2014 
Edition Release 2 Final Rule, we added 
incorporation requirements and adopted 
the updated CIRI certification criterion 
as an optional 2014 Edition certification 
criterion in § 170.314(b)(9) (79 FR 
54438). In the 2015 Edition Final Rule, 
we finalized a revised 2015 Edition CIRI 
certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(2) 
(80 FR 62749), and we updated the 
related C–CDA standards for the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(2) 
in both the Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 
25677) and the HTI–1 Final Rule (89 FR 
1224). 
We have reviewed and evaluated the 
CIRI certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(b)(2), seeking to identify ways 
to reduce burden while still supporting 
our policy goals. As we have stressed in 
prior rulemaking, we take an 
incremental approach to improving 
health IT interoperability and 
performance, relying on factors such as 
market prevalence and industry 
readiness to harmonize current and 
future standards and phase out 
standards and certification criteria as 
needed (75 FR 2020). Our review of 
industry adoption of the CIRI 
certification criterion indicates 
widespread adoption. Review also 
indicates that its capabilities are widely 
implemented and used in health IT at 
this time and thus not likely to go away 
as supported capabilities by developers 
of certified health IT solely on the basis 
of removal of the criterion from the 
Certification Program
24
(see section 
III.A for a discussion on ‘‘widely 
adopted’’ and ‘‘widely implemented’’). 
We also have seen indications that 
removing the certification criterion from 
the Certification Program could spur 
greater development and innovation in 
this area. In conversations with 
developers and implementers, we have 
seen technology that innovates on CIRI, 
providing functionality beyond 
Certification Program requirements that 
supports direct incorporation of 
information received from trusted 
sources. 
We have concluded that removing the 
CIRI certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(b)(2) would reduce burden for 
health IT developers, such as testing 
and other burden associated with 
certification to this criterion, while still 
allowing ASTP/ONC to achieve our 
policy goals of supporting 
interoperability and access to quality 
EHI at the point of care. Additionally, 
we believe that removing this C–CDA- 
based certification criterion from the 
Certification Program would encourage 
movement toward FHIR-based standards 
which can further spur innovation and 
development in this area, improving 
interoperability and patient care. 
Because the certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(b)(2) is a requirement for 
Promoting Interoperability measures, we 
believe a transition date for removal is 
needed. We propose a January 1, 2027, 
effective date for the removal of the CIRI 
certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(2). 
We welcome feedback on these 
proposals. 
c. Security Tags—Summary of Care 
We propose to remove the ‘‘security 
tags—summary of care—send’’ 
certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(7) 
and the ‘‘security tags—summary of 
care—receive’’ certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(b)(8) and reserve those 
sections. Together, these certification 
criteria support the application and 
persistence of security labels for 
document-based exchange. The security 
tags—summary of care—send 
certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(7) 
enables a user to create a summary 
record that is tagged as restricted and 
subject to restrictions on re-disclosure, 
while the security tags—summary of 
care—receive certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(b)(8) enables a user to receive 
a summary record that is tagged as 
restricted and subject to restrictions on 
re-disclosure. These criteria are not 
currently included in the Base EHR 
definition. 
The certification criteria in 
§ 170.315(b)(7) and (b)(8) were 
originally adopted in the 2015 Edition 
Final Rule as ‘‘data segmentation for 
privacy’’ (DS4P) certification criteria 
and only required security tagging of C– 
CDA documents at the document level 
(80 FR 62646 and 62647). In the Cures 
Act Final Rule, we updated the 
requirements to support security tagging 
of C–CDA documents at the document, 
section, and entry levels (85 FR 25646). 
We have reviewed the security tags— 
summary of care—send certification 
criterion in § 170.315(b)(7) and the 
security tags—summary of care—receive 
certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(8), 
evaluating how to reduce burden while 
still addressing policy priorities to 
support privacy protections in 
information exchange. As we have 
stated previously in this proposed rule, 
we consider factors such as market 
prevalence and the uptake in 
implementation of criteria by 
developers of health IT when making 
revisions to Certification Program 
certification criteria. Currently, 35 
unique Health IT Modules are certified 
to the criterion in § 170.315(b)(7), and 
36 unique Health IT Modules are 
certified to the criterion in 
§ 170.315(b)(8), out of a total of 707 
active and non-suspended certifications 
listed on the Certified Health IT Product 
List (CHPL), a comprehensive listing of 
all certified health IT successfully tested 
and certified under the Certification 
Program.
25
We believe that in this case 
the low number of Health IT Modules 
certified to these criteria indicate that 
the criteria may not be of sufficient 
value to health IT developers to warrant 
continued inclusion in the Certification 
Program. Additionally, as the industry 
moves toward greater use of FHIR-based 
standards, the removal of these C–CDA- 
based criteria in the Certification 
Program would help spur further 
innovation and advancement in this 
area. 
We have concluded that removing the 
certification criteria in § 170.315(b)(7) 
and (8) would reduce burden for health 
IT developers and health care providers 
while still supporting our policy goals 
to support privacy protections in 
information exchange. We propose to 
remove the security tags—summary of 
care—send certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(b)(7) and the security tags— 
summary of care—receive certification 
criterion in § 170.315(b)(8) as of the 
effective date of a final rule. We 
welcome feedback on these proposals. 
d. Care Plan

certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(9) 
and reserve that section. This criterion

criterion is not currently included in the 
Base EHR definition. The certification 
criterion in § 170.315(b)(9) was first 
adopted in the 2015 Edition Final Rule 
and required a Health IT Module to 
enable a user to record, change, access, 
create, and receive care plan 
information in accordance with the C– 
CDA Release 2.1 standard in 
§ 170.205(a)(4) (80 FR 62648). We 
updated the criterion in the Cures Act 
Final Rule to also require the HL7 CDA

the C–CDA Companion Guide Release 
4.1 standard in § 170.205(a)(6) (89 FR 
1224). 
We have evaluated the care plan 
certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(9) 
with a goal of reducing burden on 
health IT developers and health care 
providers while still achieving our 
policy priorities. Currently, 54 unique 
Health IT Modules are certified to the 
criterion in § 170.315(b)(9) out of a total 
of 707 active and non-suspended 
certifications listed on the CHPL. We 
believe this may indicate low interest by 
health IT developers in certifying to this 
criterion.
26
As discussed previously in 
this proposed rule, the industry is 
moving away from C–CDA-based 
standards to the use of FHIR-based 
standards that offer greater flexibility 
and potential for innovation. ASTP/ 
ONC recently highlighted the 
development of FHIR-based care plan 
IGs, including the Multiple Chronic 
Condition eCare Plan and the Electronic 
Long Term Services & Support Care 
Plan IGs, in a January 2025 standards 
bulletin.
27
Additionally, input from 
industry has indicated that the care plan 
document type is less frequently 
adopted than other C–CDA document 
types, and where it is utilized, health IT 
developers are not likely to cease 
supporting the functionality if the 
criterion is removed from the 
Certification Program. 
We have concluded that removing the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(9) 
would reduce burden for health IT 
developers and health care providers 
while still supporting our goals. 
Additionally, as discussed previously, 
moving away from C–CDA-based 
requirements in the Certification 
Program would help promote greater 
innovation and advancement in this 
area. We propose to remove the care 
plan certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(b)(9) as of the effective date of 
a final rule. We welcome feedback on 
these proposals. 
e. Decision Support Interventions 
We propose to revise the ‘‘decision 
support interventions’’ (DSI) 
certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(b)(11). The DSI certification 
criterion ensures that users can leverage 
health IT for clinical decision-making 
by supporting their selection of both 
evidence-based and predictive DSIs and 
enabling users’ access to transparent 
information on DSI performance and 
quality. In the HTI–1 Final Rule, we 
adopted the DSI certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(b)(11) as both an update and 
replacement criterion for the CDS 
certification criterion in § 170.315(a)(9) 
(89 FR 1236). We also added 
§ 170.315(b)(11) to the Base EHR 
definition in the HTI–1 Final Rule (89 
FR 1197). When we finalized the DSI 
certification criterion in the HTI–1 Final 
Rule, we cited E.O. 14091 on Further 
Advancing Racial Equity and Support 
for Underserved Communities Through 
the Federal Government (February 16, 
2023), which addressed bias in AI, and 
E.O. 14110 on Safe, Secure, and 
Trustworthy Development and Use of 
Artificial Intelligence (October 30, 
2023), which addressed the risks of AI 
(89 FR 1232). These EOs were revoked 
in E.O. 14148 on Initial Rescissions of 
Harmful Executive Orders and Actions 
(January 20, 2025). 
We have reviewed and evaluated the 
DSI certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(b)(11), focusing on ways to 
reduce burden while still supporting 
our policy priorities. As we have noted 
previously in this proposed rule and in 
prior rulemakings, we consider factors 
such as standards maturity, market 
adoption, and complexity of 
implementation when adopting, 
revising, or phasing out standards and 
certification criteria (75 FR 2020). 
Currently, the requirements in 
§ 170.315(b)(11) reference data 
expressed in the USCDI standards in 
§ 170.213. We have received feedback 
from developers of certified health IT 
that requiring support of predictive DSIs 
that use any data element in one of the USCDI standards in § 170.213 has 
proven burdensome and costly to 
implement, with questionable value. 
While many USCDI data elements are 
routinely used in decision support and 
would be important inputs to predictive 
DSI, other USCDI data elements, such as 
phone number and phone number type 
data elements, are not likely to be used 
as inputs. 
We propose to revise the DSI 
certification criterion in § 170.315(b)(11) 
as detailed below as of the effective date 
of a subsequent final rule. We propose 
to remove the requirement in 
§ 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B) to enable 
interventions when a patient’s 
medications, allergies and intolerance, 
and problems are incorporated from a 
transition of care or referral summary 
received and pursuant to paragraph 
§ 170.315(b)(2)(iii)(D). As described 
above in section III.A.2.b, we propose to 
remove § 170.315(b)(2), which is a C– 
CDA-based criterion, from the 
Certification Program completely as of 
January 1, 2027. Thus, we propose to 
remove the requirement in 
§ 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B), which references 
§ 170.315(b)(2), as well. We also propose 
to redesignate the certification criterion 
currently in § 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(C) as 
§ 170.315(b)(11)(ii)(B). 
We propose to remove the 
parenthetical reference in 
§ 170.315(b)(11)(iii) to ‘‘drug-drug and 
drug-allergy contraindication checking’’ 
upon the effective date of a final rule. 
We have retained the ‘‘drug-drug, drug- 
allergy interaction checks for CPOE’’ 
certification criterion in § 170.315(a)(4), 
and in order to simplify overall 
Certification Program requirements, we 
do not believe it is necessary to 
reference this capability as part of 
decision support functionality in 
§ 170.315(b)(11)(iii). We note that this 
reference was initially included as part 
of the revisions made to the 
Certification Program’s decision support 
certification criterion (then referenced 
in § 170.314(a)(8)) in 2012 (see 77 FR 
54215). Since this time, the Certification 
Program has taken deliberate actions to 
support a more modular marketplace for 
health IT (see 84 FR 7428, 89 FR 63567 
through 63568, and 90 FR 37158). 
Removal of this specified capability 
within § 170.315(b)(11) to support drug- 
drug and drug-allergy contraindication 
checking furthers this goal of 
modularity without precluding support 
for such interaction checks, due to the 
retention of requirements in 
§ 170.315(b)(11)(iii)(A)(2) and (3) 
regarding enabling evidence-based DSIs 
that include ‘‘Medications’’ and

‘‘Allergies and Intolerances,’’ 
respectively, as data types. 
Additionally, we propose to revise the 
requirements in § 170.315(b)(11)(iii)(B), 
which currently relate to enabling 
predictive DSIs that use any data 
expressed in the standards in § 170.213, 
to limit the application of the 
certification criterion to just data 
expressed in § 170.315(b)(11)(iii)(A) as 
well as data expressed in the Clinical 
Notes and the Assessment and Plan of 
Treatment data classes in the standards 
in § 170.213. While we originally 
wanted to apply the requirements of this 
certification criterion to any data 
expressed in the standards in § 170.213 
in order to reflect our focus on the 
USCDI and the variety of data for which 
DSIs may be enabled, we believe a 
number of USCDI data elements are not 
likely to be used as inputs, as 
mentioned above. We believe that 
revising the requirements to focus on 
fewer data elements would significantly 
reduce burden for health IT developers 
without diminishing users’ ability to 
select (i.e., activate) a wide variety of predictive DSIs that use remaining 
USCDI data elements as inputs. 
Finally, we propose to remove the 
requirements in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv) and 
(v) regarding source attribute support, 
access, and modification and in 
§ 170.315(b)(11)(vi) regarding 
intervention risk management for 
predictive DSIs. In addition to reducing 
burden, removal of these requirements 
would comply with E.O. 14179 on 
Removing Barriers to American 
Leadership in Artificial Intelligence 
(January 23, 2025). E.O. 14179 calls for 
the review of regulations and other 
actions taken pursuant to revoked E.O. 
14110, and any actions taken that are 
inconsistent with the policy set forth in 
E.O. 14179 to ‘‘sustain and enhance 
America’s global AI dominance in order 
to promote human flourishing, 
economic competitiveness, and national 
security’’
28
shall be suspended, revised, 
or rescinded as appropriate and 
consistent with applicable law.
29
 
Despite proposing source attribute 
information transparency and 
intervention risk management more 
than six months prior to issuance of 
E.O. 14110,
30
we note that many of our 
fundamental assumptions and 
objectives were aligned with the stated 
goals of E.O. 14110 to advance ‘‘safe, 
secure, and trustworthy development 
and use of artificial intelligence.’’ 
Additionally, we note several factors 
supporting the proposal to modify the 
DSI certification criterion. First, 
developers of certified health IT have 
reported that during care delivery, most 
clinical users lack the time or technical 
background to engage with source 
attribute information for either 
evidence-based DSIs or predictive DSIs 
supplied by the developer of certified 
health IT.
31
Despite having access to 
source attribute information since the 
beginning of 2025, when Health IT 
Modules certified to § 170.315(b)(11) 
began to be first deployed, we have no 
publicly available evidence indicating 
that a single doctor, nurse, or 
administrator has accessed, recorded, or 
modified a single source attribute. 
Further, we have no publicly available 
evidence that transparency 
requirements in § 170.315(b)(11) have 
led to positive impacts on patient care, 
such as removing deficient or untested 
algorithms, or testing a deployed 
algorithm on local data. We believe that 
the underlying assumption that source 
attribute information would be valuable 
to health care delivery organizations 
and health care professionals when 
deciding whether to implement or use a 
DSI (as stated in the HTI–1 Final 
Rule)
32
was incorrect. 
Second, transparency regarding how a 
predictive or generative AI application 
was designed, developed, tested, 
evaluated, and should be used may not 
have the savings and benefits we 
anticipated. As described in the 
regulatory impact analysis (RIA) to the 
HTI–1 Final Rule, we estimated 
considerable benefits from this policy 
(89 FR 1411), noting that transparency 
into AI applications would result in 
health care delivery organizations 
selecting and using more accurate AI 
applications. We quantified associated 
benefits for two illustrative cases, sepsis 
detection and ambulatory care sensitive 
admissions (89 FR 1412 through 1414), 
estimating that our policies would result 
in a 10-year savings of up to $3 billion 
for the sepsis use case through increased 
application of more sensitive predictive 
models for this condition. We have not 
encountered supporting evidence or 
published research indicating that 
source attribute transparency 
requirements in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv) 
have improved health care delivery 
organizations’ evaluation and effective 
use of AI. We understand that the 
benefits articulated in the HTI–1 Final 
Rule impact analysis are not being 
realized. 
Third, developers of certified health 
IT have reported an inconsistent 
approach to oversight of other parties 
producing similar, health-based AI 
systems.
33
They note that ‘‘[t]he current 
model of imposing rigorous 
requirements [(i.e., algorithmic transparency and risk management)] on 
certified health IT but not the many 
other tech companies working in this 
space is simply unacceptable and needs 
to be remedied.’’
34
While we attempted 
to encourage more consistent and 
ubiquitous transparency requirements 
across similar applications in our April 
2023 proposals for predictive DSI in the 
HTI–1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23782), 
and have worked with federal partners 
on alignment with similar policy 
objectives since finalization of the HTI– 
1 Final Rule in January 2024,
35 36
we 
acknowledge that our authorities have 
limitations that inhibit our collective 
efforts to treat similar technologies 
similarly under a single Department- 
wide policy. 
Finally, in order to promote 
innovation of AI in health care, we 
propose to remove transparency and 
risk management requirements 
established in the HTI–1 Final Rule. 
Additionally, we have heard from 
health IT developers that the 
requirements are burdensome and 
detrimental to such innovation and 
growth, which is the opposite of our 
stated policy intent to optimize the 
ubiquitous use of high-quality AI in 
health care. 
For these and the aforementioned 
reasons, we propose to remove all 
requirements related to source attributes 
in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv), their access in 
§ 170.315(b)(11)(v)(A), and their 
modification in § 170.315(b)(11)(v)(B), 
as well as requirements to manage risks 
related to the development and 
deployment of predictive DSIs supplied 
by health IT developers as part of their 
product in § 170.315(b)(11)(vi). We 
welcome comments on these proposals.

3. Clinical Quality Measures 
Certification Criteria 
a. Clinical Quality Measures—Report 
We propose to revise the ‘‘clinical 
quality measures—report’’ certification 
criterion in § 170.315(c)(3) as of the 
effective date of a final rule. We propose 
to remove the requirement in 
§ 170.315(c)(3)(ii), as this provision may 
no longer be used to support 
certification to the criterion. In the 
Cures Act Interim Final Rule, we 
revised § 170.315(c)(3) to include a 
corrected compliance transition 
timeline for the criterion in 
§ 170.315(c)(3)(ii), which specified the 
use of standards in § 170.205(h)(2) and 
in § 170.205(k)(1) and (2), for the period 
before December 31, 2022 (85 FR 70075, 
70083). We propose to remove 
paragraph § 170.315(c)(3)(ii) because 
that transition time period has elapsed. 
We also propose to move the 
requirements in § 170.315(c)(3)(i) to 
§ 170.315(c)(3), thus removing all 
subparagraphs and including all 
criterion requirements in the main 
paragraph for § 170.315(c)(3). We 
welcome comments on our proposal. 
b. Clinical Quality Measures—Filter 
We propose to remove the ‘‘clinical 
quality measures—filter’’ certification 
criterion in § 170.315(c)(4) with an 
effective date of January 1, 2027. This 
certification criterion assesses whether a 
Health IT Module can filter quality data 
based on a set of standardized data 
elements for electronic clinical quality 
measures (eCQM) calculated using 
certified health IT. 
In the Voluntary Edition Proposed 
Rule, we proposed a new certification 
criterion in § 170.315(c)(4) that would 
require health IT to record structured 
data allowing CQM results to be 
grouped by patient characteristics (79 
FR 10903 and 10904).
37
We proposed 
this capability to support eCQM 
reporting by group practice or 
accountable care organization (ACO). 
We also proposed capturing patient 
characteristics that support 
identification of health disparities, that 
help providers identify gaps in quality, 
and that support delivery of specialized 
care to needful patient subgroups. We 
did not adopt this certification criterion 
in the 2014 Edition Release 2 Final Rule 
as we received comments 
recommending refinement of the use 
cases and performance of more analysis 
on which data elements are being 
captured in standardized ways (79 FR 
54462). 
In the 2015 Edition Proposed Rule (80 
FR 16844) we proposed to add 
§ 170.315(c)(4) as a new certification 
criterion for CQM filtering based on the 
rationale that health IT should support 
an organization’s ability to filter 
individual and aggregate eCQM results 
in ways that support administrative 
reporting, identification of health 
disparities, and identification of gaps in 
care. 
In the 2015 Edition Final Rule, we 
adopted the ‘‘CQMs—filter’’ 
certification criterion in § 170.315(c)(4), 
along with three other CQM certification 
criteria: ‘‘CQMs—record and export’’ 
(§ 170.315(c)(1)), ‘‘CQMs—import and 
calculate’’ (§ 170.315(c)(2)), and 
‘‘CQMs—report’’ (§ 170.315(c)(3)) (80 FR 
62649 through 62655). Together, these 
four criteria were adopted to support 
providers’ quality improvement 
activities and to support reporting to 
programs such as the EHR Incentive 
Programs, Quality Payment Program, 
and Comprehensive Primary Care plus 
initiative. 
The 2015 Edition Final Rule adopted 
§ 170.315(c)(4) as a new 2015 Edition 
certification criterion that supports the 
capability of a clinician to filter eCQM 
results using data captured for quality 
improvement and quality reporting 
purposes. We finalized that Health IT 
Modules certified to § 170.315(c)(4) 
must be able to: record data and filter 
CQM results at both patient and 
aggregate levels; filter by any 
combination of the data elements 
established as part of the criterion with 
associated vocabulary standards; create 
a data file of the filtered data in 
accordance with the QRDA Category I 
and Category III standards; and display 
the filtered data in a human readable 
format. 
This certification criterion is not 
included in the Base EHR definition in 
§ 170.102 but is included in the CEHRT 
definition for MIPS in 42 CFR 414.1305 
as an optional criterion. While we 
recognize the value of this functionality, 
we propose to remove this criterion for 
multiple reasons. We reviewed and 
evaluated existing regulations to 
identify deregulatory actions that would 
reduce administrative burden, and the 
private expenditures required for 
compliance with federal regulations. We 
have identified that the administrative 
costs of certification for the CQMs— 
filter certification criterion are no longer 
offset by the benefits of advancing the 
specific functionality supported by the 
criterion. Further, we do not believe that 
quality measure filtering functionality 
would be removed from health IT 
systems because of our proposal to 
remove this criterion. 
Quality reporting programs, such as 
those required by states and CMS 
programs, require broader supplemental 
data and capabilities beyond what we 
currently require for certification. In 
addition, health IT developers have 
widely implemented technology 
solutions that expand beyond the 
baseline requirements of the 
certification criterion (see section III.A 
for a discussion on ‘‘widely 
implemented’’). Through listening 
sessions with a wide range of health 
care provider types and sites of service, 
public correspondence, and CHPL data, 
we understand that the use of the 
CQMs—filter certified functionality is 
fairly low relative to the other 
certification criteria that support 
clinical quality measure capabilities. 
According to CHPL data, as of August 
2025, there are 340 active Health IT 
Modules certified to § 170.315(c)(1), (2), 
or (3), but only 71 active Health IT 
Modules certified to § 170.315(c)(4). 
Among the feedback we have received, 
health care providers participating in 
CMS alternative payment models, as 
well as health IT developers supporting 
quality initiatives, have reported that 
they have different options to filter 
eCQM results, including using 
customized systems and/or the support 
of third parties to support innovative, 
specialty-specific quality measurement 
and reporting tailored to their particular 
needs. We therefore believe the value of 
maintaining this certification criterion is 
minimal as health IT developer time 
and resources would be better spent on 
quality data system modernization 
efforts leveraging FHIR-based APIs for 
quality data exchange. 
We therefore propose to remove the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(c)(4) 
as of January 1, 2027. 
4. Privacy and Security Certification 
Criteria 
We propose to remove all the privacy 
and security certification criteria in 
§ 170.315(d) and the associated Privacy 
and Security Certification Framework 
under § 170.550(h) as of the effective 
date of a subsequent final rule. 
We first adopted a version of the 
privacy and security certification 
criteria currently found in § 170.315(d) 
(and associated standards) in the 2011 
Edition through an interim final rule (75 
FR 2033 through 2035). These 
certification criteria originated from HIT 
Policy Committee and HIT Standards 
Committee recommendations. The

information’’).

42 U.S.C. 17935(c), sec. 13405(c) of the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, 
Public Law 111–5, 123 Stat. 265 (Feb. 17, 2009); 45 
CFR 164.528. 
criteria generally focused on basic 
technical capabilities that could be 
included in the development of Health 
IT Modules that would be certified. We 
used the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) 
Security Rule (45 CFR 164 parts 160 and 
164, subparts A and C) as the starting 
point for the Certification Program’s 
privacy and security certification 
criteria, with the intent of ensuring that 
Certified EHR Technology (now referred 
to as ‘‘certified health IT’’) included at 
least one capability to assist a HIPAA 
covered entity with complying with 
HIPAA Security Rule requirements. The 
initial criteria also included a 
certification criterion (‘‘accounting of 
disclosures’’) to support entities 
regulated under HIPAA that must 
provide an accounting of disclosures of 
protected health information
38
made in 
certain circumstances.
39
We noted, 
however, that the interim final rule 
strictly focused on the capabilities of 
Certified EHR Technology and did not 
change existing HIPAA Privacy Rule or 
Security Rule requirements, guarantee 
compliance with those requirements, or 
absolve an eligible professional, eligible 
hospital or other health care provider 
from having to comply with any 
applicable provision of the HIPAA 
Privacy or Security Rules. In addition, 
we stated that, while the capabilities 
provided by Certified EHR Technology 
may assist an eligible professional, 
eligible hospital in improving their 
technical safeguards, the use of Certified 
EHR Technology alone does not equate 
to compliance with the HIPAA Privacy 
or Security Rules. We stated that the 
capabilities provided by Certified EHR 
Technology do not in any way affect the 
analysis that an entity regulated by 
HIPAA is required to perform by 45 CFR 
164.306(b) and (d) (75 FR 2035). 
With the 2014 Edition, we included 
the privacy and security certification 
criteria in the Base EHR definition in an 
attempt to provide both developers and 
health care providers more flexibility in 
meeting Certification Program 
requirements, while still providing 
health care providers with basic 
technical options that could support 
compliance with parts of the HIPAA 
Privacy and Security Rules (77 FR 
54265). Based on recommendations 
from the HIT Standards Committee, we 
established a third privacy and security 
certification approach under 
§ 170.550(h) for the new 2015 Edition so 
that each certification criterion also had 
a set of separate privacy and security 
certification criteria attributed to them 
that were applicable to the criterion’s 
functionality (80 FR 62705 through 
62707). In doing so, we established the 
current Privacy and Security 
Certification Framework, which has 
been in place for the past 10 years. 
Under this framework, health IT 
developers have two options for meeting 
requirements: build the capabilities 
themselves natively into their certified 
health IT; or provide system 
documentation to demonstrate that the 
certified health IT could integrate (via 
service interfaces) with required privacy 
and security capabilities (80 FR 62707). 
We have come to the conclusion that, 
despite the Certification Program 
providing various certification 
flexibilities and approaches to 
accommodate the privacy and security 
certification criteria (i.e., different approaches for the 2011, 2014 and 2015 
Editions), the costs and burden of these 
Certification Program requirements far 
exceed their intended purpose and 
benefits. 
First, we have found that health IT 
developers have changed their 
development processes to build in 
privacy and security capabilities to meet 
these certification requirements rather 
than attempting to demonstrate that 
their technology could interface with 
other health IT that provides these 
capabilities. This has led to negative 
experiences for health care providers 
who have sought to use a best-of-breed, 
non-certified security technology to 
work across their deployed enterprise 
(e.g., a third-party audit log). Second, as certified health IT (which 
is generally EHR-focused technology) is 
often implemented in enterprise-wide 
settings (e.g., group practices, large health care systems, multi-provider 
cloud-supported services), such 
certified health IT cannot in isolation, or 
independently, provide the necessary 
privacy and security capabilities for 
HIPAA Security Rule compliance across 
all relevant technologies of the 
enterprise-wide setting. 
Third, while certified health IT has 
always been ‘‘linked’’ to the Medicare 
Promoting Interoperability Program and 
the MIPS Promoting Interoperability 
performance category, those programs 
have not required participating health 
care providers to use or implement the 
privacy and security capabilities 
included in certified health IT for 
purposes of meeting the security risk 
analysis measure. Rather, the health 
care providers must ‘‘have’’ such 
certified health IT. As such and as 
discussed in more detail below, health 
care providers participating in the 
Medicare Promoting Interoperability 
Program or the MIPS Promoting 
Interoperability performance category 
are required to adopt certified 
capabilities that they may not use 
because, for example, they may prefer a 
non-certified security health IT product 
to meet their overall security needs 
under relevant HIPAA Security Rule 
requirements. 
Fourth, many stakeholders have 
overinterpreted the Certification 
Program’s limited scope and policy 
purpose with respect to health IT 
security and instead assumed that the 
Certification Program assessed discrete 
specific security capabilities at 
significant depths, such as when and 
how the capabilities are implemented in 
health care provider or system settings. 
For example, stakeholders have 
expressed incorrect expectations of 
certified health IT and developers, such 
as expectations that the Certification 
Program required health IT developers 
of certified health IT to implement and 
conduct penetration testing of certified 
health IT or ensure that certified 
authentication and authorization 
capabilities protect against known or 
unknown vulnerabilities. In contrast, 
and to allow for significant scalable 
deployment flexibility, certified heath 
IT must only, for example, demonstrate 
support for basic authentication and 
role-based access control. 
Finally, there remains a disconnect 
between health IT certified to the 
privacy and security certification 
criteria under the Certification Program 
and the implementation and compliance 
responsibilities of most purchasers and 
users of certified health IT with the 
HIPAA Privacy and Security Rule 
requirements. This disconnect has led to 
the introduction of unnecessary 
regulatory burden and duplication, as 
well as unwarranted opportunity costs 
for innovation. As we noted above and 
in our rulemakings related to the 
privacy and security certification 
criteria, the adoption of health IT 
certified to the privacy and security 
certification criteria does not guarantee 
compliance with the HIPAA Privacy 
and Security Rule requirements. 
Further, the adoption of health IT 
certified to the privacy and security 
certification criteria does not serve as an 
affirmative defense, has not been 
identified as a mitigating factor in 
assessing HIPAA civil money penalties, 
and does not exempt a HIPAA-regulated 
entity from having to comply with any 
applicable provision of the HIPAA 
Privacy or Security Rules. These facts 
alone have created unnecessary burden 
for health care providers that adopt

HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules.
40
In 
fact, we have heard from stakeholders 
both arguing that our certification 
requirements go beyond the HIPAA 
Security Rule requirements (75 FR 
44619, 80 FR 62707) or do not go far 
enough in meeting HIPAA Privacy Rule 
and Security Rule requirements (80 FR 
62691, 62706). As such, our 
Certification Program requirements are 
diverting financial resources and efforts 
from innovative, agile, and 
comprehensive solutions that can 
address the threats faced by health care 
providers and meet their regulatory 
obligations under the HIPAA Privacy 
and Security Rules. By removing the 
privacy and security certification 
requirements under the Certification 
Program, we will provide health IT 
developers with the flexibility to 
innovate in this area and to develop 
new solutions to address the needs of 
their customers. Such an approach 
should also spur competition and give 
health care providers, including small 
practices, the opportunity to choose the 
best privacy and security technologies 
that fit their needs at the best price 
versus being forced to accept those 
capabilities included in certified health 
IT that may not fit their health 
information privacy and security needs 
for various reasons. 
We will continue to collaborate with 
our colleagues in HHS to promote 
privacy and security and to strengthen 
the nation’s critical health care 
infrastructure. Equally, we are not 
completely foregoing the adoption of 
privacy and security capabilities within 
the Certification Program. Instead, going 
forward, we intend to prioritize the 
adoption of privacy and security 
capabilities that are fit for purpose, use 
case specific, and deliver much needed 
technical consistency in the market 
when paired with specific conformance 
requirements. For example, as we 
pursue more API-focused certification 
criteria, if the standards and 
implementation guides adopted for 
them do not specify or leave optional 
specific security requirements, we may 
look to add further constraints (e.g., 
multi-factor authentication support). 
But in all cases, we intend to make 
security capability conformance a built- 
in part of a certification criterion’s 
conformance and not the separate and 
stand-alone conformance assessment 
that it is today. With this planned 
approach in mind, we also request 
comment on an alternative proposal as 
discussed below. 
In lieu of removing, on the effective 
date of a subsequent final rule, all of the 
privacy and security certification 
criteria in § 170.315(d) and the 
associated Privacy and Security 
Certification Framework under 
§ 170.550(h), we would retain the 
‘‘auditable events and tamper 
resistance’’ (§ 170.315(d)(2)), ‘‘audit 
report(s)’’ (§ 170.315(d)(2)), and 
‘‘auditing actions on health 
information’’ (§ 170.315(d)(10)) 
certification criteria and associated 
Privacy and Security Certification 
Framework certification requirements. 
These certification criteria and included 
functionality may serve to help identify 
fraud and abuse. The functionality may 
also support health care provider 
compliance obligations and 
investigations by relevant entities, 
including both civil and criminal 
matters at the federal and state levels. 
Identifying and addressing fraud and 
abuse increases confidence in the 
nation’s health care system, reduces 
inappropriate and wasteful spending, 
and protects taxpayer dollars when it 
comes to government spending on 
health care. 
We welcome feedback on these 
proposals. 
5. Patient Engagement Certification 
Criteria 
a. View, Download, and Transmit to a 
3rd Party 
We propose to revise the ‘‘view, 
download, and transmit to 3rd party’’ 
(VDT) certification criterion in three 
ways as described below. These 
proposed revisions, if finalized, would 
be effective as of the effective date of a 
subsequent final rule. 
We first included the Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) 
standard as a requirement of the view, 
download, and transmit to 3rd party 
(VDT) certification criterion 
(§ 170.315(e)(1)) in the 2014 Edition. 
Specifically, the VDT certification 
criterion viewing capability required 
conformance to WCAG Level A (77 FR 
54179). This provided an accessibility 
baseline for health IT certified to the 
criterion. With the 2015 Edition, we 
proposed compliance with WCAG Level 
AA (as we did for the 2014 Edition) but 
finalized a policy that gave developers 
the option of demonstrating 
conformance with either Level A or 
Level AA to meet the certification 
requirements (80 FR 62660). 
We now propose to remove the 
WCAG conformance requirement from 
the certification criterion (found in 
§ 170.315(e)(1)(i)). As noted above, the 
WCAG baseline certification standard of 
Level A was adopted with the 2014 
Edition in 2012 and has been part of the 
VDT certification criterion since that 
time. The functionality is now 
sufficiently widespread among certified 
health IT and health care providers who 
adopt such technology. This is true 
because the VDT certification criterion 
has been part of the CEHRT definitions 
and specifically supports the patient 
access measure under the Medicare 
Promoting Interoperability Program and 
MIPS Promoting Interoperability 
performance category since the 2014 
Edition. By removing the WCAG 
certification requirement, health IT 
developers of health IT currently 
certified to § 170.315(e)(1) will have the 
opportunity to consider other 
innovative ways to provide patients 
with the viewing functionality. To this 
point, commenters noted in response to 
the 2014 Edition WCAG proposals that 
most patients want functions and 
content provided in a more visually 
appealing manner than the WCAG 
standard allows. Further, as we noted in 
the 2011 Edition Interim Final Rule and 
again in response to comments on the 
2011 Edition Interim Final Rule, in 
providing patients with access to their 
online health information, the 
accessibility requirements of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 
and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation 
Act of 1973 still apply to entities 
covered by these federal civil rights 
laws (75 FR 2036, 75 FR 44643). In 
addition, Section 1557 of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act 
(Affordable Care Act) prohibits covered 
entities from subjecting individuals to 
certain forms of discrimination, 
including on the grounds prohibited by 
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, in 
any health program or activity.
41
Health 
IT developers and other health programs 
or activities who receive Federal 
financial assistance under the 
Certification Program or other federal 
programs likely qualify as covered 
entities
42
under Section 1557 and 
would be required to comply with 
applicable accessibility requirements. 
Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation 
Act, recipients of financial assistance 
from HHS must conform to certain 
accessibility requirements, including 
but not limited to using the WCAG 2.1

mobile applications, as detailed in 45 
CFR 84.82 through 84.89. Additionally, 
under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation 
Act (Pub. L. 93–112; Sep. 26, 1973), 
HHS must ensure the information and 
communication technology it develops, 
procures, maintains, or uses, allows 
comparable access and use for people 
with disabilities, including by 
conforming to the success criteria of 
WCAG 2.0 AA. See 29 U.S.C. 794d; 36 
CFR part 1194. As such, we expect 
health IT developers will continue to 
meet these requirements and provide 
the necessary accessibility within their 
products certified to the VDT 
certification criterion. 
We also propose to remove the VDT 
requirement in § 170.315(e)(1)(ii)(A)(2) 
to conform with any Network Time 
Protocol (NTP) standard for purposes of 
‘‘date and time each action occurred’’ 
under the activity log. In the HTI–1 
Final Rule, we revised the requirement 
from conformance with the Network 
Time Protocol v4 of the RFC 5905 
standard to compliance with any 
Network Time Protocol standard (89 FR 
1283; § 170.210(g)). As a result, health 
IT could be certified by demonstrating 
that it could use any NTP to 
synchronize clocks for time accuracy. 
However, we have received feedback 
over the years from developers stating 
that the requirement should not be part 
of certification because the functionality 
was not native to the EHR technology 
(rather part of the operating system 
within which the EHR technology runs) 
and was unnecessary for certification 
because EHRs use of underlying 
operating system clocks is 
commonplace (88 FR 23811). Consistent 
with our overall goal to reduce 
regulatory burden, we agree that there is 
currently little value, and unnecessary 
burden, in maintaining the conformance 
requirement as part of certification. We 
do not expect that developers will stop 
using NTP with their certified health IT. 
Rather, we expect that developers will 
continue to use NTPs, such as 
Microsoft’s MS–SNTP, due to ongoing 
evolution in the industry. 
We propose to remove and reserve 
§ 170.315(e)(1)(i)(A)(1) because the 
requirement has an expiration date of 
December 31, 2025, which expires by 
the time a subsequent final rule will be 
issued. Additionally, we similarly 
propose to revise § 170.315(e)(1)(i)(B)(1) 
and (2) to remove references to 
§ 170.205(a)(5) because the standard 
codified in this paragraph also has an 
expiration date of December 31, 2025. 
Finally, we propose to provide a 
heading for the paragraph at 
§ 170.315(e)(1)(i), which would be 
‘‘general.’’ This would align the 
paragraph with similar level paragraphs 
that have headings (§ 170.315(e)(1)(ii) 
and (iii)) and would be compliant with 
the Office of the Federal Register 
Drafting Handbook. 
We welcome comments on these 
proposals. 
b. Patient Health Information Capture 
We propose to remove the ‘‘patient 
health information capture’’ 
certification criterion in § 170.315(e)(3) 
with an effective date of January 1, 
2027, and to reserve that section. The 
patient health information capture 
certification criterion allows health care 
providers to incorporate unstructured 
patient generated health data or data 
from a non-clinical setting into a patient 
record. The criterion is not currently 
included in the Base EHR definition; 
however, the criterion is included in 
CEHRT definitions established by CMS 
for the Medicare Promoting 
Interoperability Program (42 CFR 495.4) 
and the MIPS Promoting 
Interoperability performance category 
(42 CFR 414.1305). 
The patient health information 
capture certification criterion was first 
adopted in the 2015 Edition Health IT 
Certification Criteria, 2015 Edition Base 
Electronic Health Record (EHR) 
Definition, and ONC Health IT 
Certification Program Modifications 
Final Rule (80 FR 62602). The criterion 
replaced the § 170.314(a)(17) advance 
directives and applied to various patient 
health information documents (80 FR 
62661). In the 2015 Edition Final Rule, 
we stated that a Health IT Module 
would need to enable a user to: (1) 
identify (e.g., label health information documents as advance directives and 
birth plans), record (capture and store) 
and access (ability to examine or 
review) patient health information 
documents; (2) reference and link to 
patient health information documents; 
and (3) record and access information 
directly and electronically shared by a 
patient. This criterion was specifically 
included in the CEHRTdefinition to 
ensure, at a minimum, providers 
participating in the EHR Incentive 
Programs (now the Medicare Promoting 
Interoperability Program and the MIPS 
Promoting Interoperability performance 
category) had this capability. 
The intent of the criterion is to 
establish at least one means for 
accepting patient health information 
directly and electronically from patients 
in the most flexible manner possible (80 
FR 62662). The criterion did not define 
the types of health information that 
could be accepted as we believed it 
should be as broad as possible and 
could be documents or health 
information from devices or 
applications. The devices and 
applications could include home health 
or personal health monitoring devices, 
fitness and nutrition applications, or a 
variety of other devices and 
applications. In addition, patient health 
information could be accepted directly 
and electronically through a patient 
portal, an API, or even email (80 FR 
62662). As adopted, we anticipated 
health IT developers would develop 
innovative and efficient ways to meet 
this criterion and simultaneously 
support providers accepting health 
information from patients. 
We have reviewed and evaluated the 
patient health information capture 
certification criterion in § 170.315(e)(3), 
seeking to identify ways to reduce 
burden while still supporting our policy 
goals. As we have stressed in prior 
rulemaking, we take an incremental 
approach to improving health IT 
interoperability and performance, 
relying on factors such as market 
prevalence and industry readiness to 
harmonize current and future standards 
and phase out standards and 
certification criteria as needed (75 FR 
2021). Our review of industry adoption 
of the patient health information 
capture certification criterion has found 
that the capabilities described in the 
criterion are widely implemented (as 
discussed above in section III.A) and 
used in health IT at this time, suggesting 
that these capabilities will remain in 
health IT products even if the 
corresponding criterion is removed from 
the Certification Program. We also have 
seen indications that removing the 
criterion from the Certification Program 
could spur greater development and 
innovation in this area. 
We have concluded that removing the 
patient health information capture 
certification criterion in § 170.315(e)(3) 
on January 1, 2027, would reduce 
administrative burden as well as burden 
for health IT developers of certified 
health IT and health care providers 
while still allowing us to achieve our 
policy goals. There are other 
certification criteria that support patient 
engagement, such as the 2015 Edition 
view, download, and transmit to 3rd 
party and ‘‘API’’ certification criteria. 
We have seen developers integrate the 
functionality in the patient health 
information capture certification 
criterion as part of other patient 
engagement features, such as patient 
portals. With these considerations in 
mind, we believe removing this 
criterion from the Certification Program 
will help reduce burden and costs, 
while also spurring further innovations

in patient engagement. Because the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(e)(3) 
is a requirement for CEHRT definitions 
established by CMS, we believe a 
transition date is needed. Therefore, we 
propose to remove the patient health 
information capture certification 
criterion in § 170.315(e)(3) effective 
January 1, 2027. We welcome feedback 
on this proposal. 
6. Public Health Certification Criteria 
a. Transmission to Cancer Registries 
We propose to remove the 
‘‘transmission to cancer registries’’ 
certification criterion in § 170.315(f)(4) 
with an effective date of January 1, 
2027, and reserve that section. This 
criterion assesses whether a Health IT 
Module can properly create and format 
cancer case information for electronic 
transmission according to a CDA-based 
implementation specification for 
reporting to public health agencies. In 
the 2014 Edition Final Rule, we 
expanded the public health-related 
standards and certification criteria to 
include a criterion for transmission to 
cancer registries in § 170.314(f)(6) that 
we designated as optional for Complete 
EHR certification (77 FR 54195). We 
stated that we proposed this criterion to 
support a new meaningful use objective 
and measure for reporting cancer cases 
to cancer registries (77 FR 54194). In the 
2015 Edition Final Rule, we finalized a 
revised transmission to cancer registries 
criterion in § 170.315(f)(4) which was no 
longer labeled as optional and required 
updated standards (80 FR 62666), and in 
the HTI–1 Final Rule we further 
updated the associated vocabulary 
standards (89 FR 1208). The standards 
currently referenced in the criterion 
include the Health Level 7 (HL7

) 
Implementation Guide for CDA

Release 2: Reporting to Public Health 
Cancer Registries from Ambulatory 
Healthcare Providers, Release 1, DSTU 
Release 1.1, April 2015 in 
§ 170.205(i)(2), the SNOMED CT

Observation Identifiers Names and 
Codes (LOINC

) Database Version 2.72, 
February 16, 2022 in § 170.207(c)(1). In 
the Meaningful Use Stage 3 Final Rule, 
the transmission to cancer registries 
certification criterion was identified as 
one of the criteria that eligible 
professionals could utilize to report the 
Public Health Registry measure in the 
EHR Incentive Programs (80 FR 62882). 
Subsequently, CMS stated that this 
criterion could be used to report on the 
Public Health Registry measure that was 
included in the MIPS Advancing Care 
Information performance category (later 
renamed the MIPS Promoting 
Interoperability performance category) 
(81 FR 77236). Currently, MIPS eligible 
clinicians that report on the Public 
Health Registry measure may earn 
optional bonus points for submitting 
this data.
43
 
We have reviewed and evaluated the 
transmission to cancer registries 
certification criterion in § 170.315(f)(4), 
seeking to identify ways to reduce 
burden while still supporting our policy 
goals. We recognize trends within the 
industry that support removal of this 
criterion. Of note, there is specific work 
being done to move cancer registry 
reporting from CDA to FHIR through the 
Helios FHIR Accelerator and updates to 
the Central Cancer Registry Reporting IG 
in support of more efficient tumor 
abstract completion and supportive 
harmonization and standardization of 
data elements through USCDI+ 
Cancer.
44
Given the movement toward 
these promising modernization efforts 
that rely on FHIR rather than CDA, we 
anticipate health IT developers will find 
maintaining CDA development support 
to be both duplicative and a significant 
burden. 
We believe that removing the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(f)(4) 
would reduce burden and encourage the 
ongoing evolution in cancer registry 
reporting by offering health IT 
developers space to move toward FHIR 
standards and modern reporting 
solutions, further encouraging 
innovation. We propose a January 1, 
2027, effective date for the removal of 
the transmission to cancer registries 
certification criterion in § 170.315(f)(4). 
We welcome feedback on these 
proposals. 
b. Transmission to Public Health 
Agencies—Electronic Case Reporting 
We propose to revise the 
‘‘transmission to public health 
agencies—electronic case reporting’’ 
(eCR) certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(f)(5). This criterion enables a 
user to create case reports that can be 
transmitted electronically to public 
health agencies. In the 2015 Edition 
Final Rule, we included a new 
certification criterion in § 170.315(f)(5) 
with functional requirements to support 
the electronic transmission of case 
reporting information to public health 
agencies (80 FR 62667). When we 
originally proposed this criterion, we 
highlighted several goals, including 
linking EHR data with other data in a 
structured way in order to improve 
quality, safety, population health, and 
research, as well as making case 
reporting from providers to public 
health agencies more efficient (80 FR 
16855). In the 2015 Edition Final Rule, 
we noted commenter concerns with the 
proposed standards and 
recommendations that case reporting 
continue as a public health reporting 
option for the EHR Incentive Programs, 
but without a requirement to use a 
particular standard (80 FR 62667). We 
further noted ongoing advancements in 
FHIR standards and stated that in order 
to permit flexibility and accommodate 
evolution, we would not finalize a 
required standard (80 FR 62667). 
In the HTI–1 Final Rule, we finalized 
a policy to require support for either a 
FHIR or CDA standard in order to 
provide technical design flexibility 
while still supporting the existing CDA- 
based landscape, and we established a 
transition period from functional 
requirements to standards-based 
requirements (89 FR 1227). Specifically, 
we finalized requirements in 
§ 170.315(f)(5)(ii) to create case reports 
consistent with either the HL7 FHIR 
eCR IG in § 170.205(t)(1) or the HL7 
CDA eICR IG in § 170.205(t)(2), and to 
receive, consume, and process a case 
report response formatted to either the 
HL7 FHIR eCR IG in § 170.205(t)(1) or 
the HL7 CDA RR IG in § 170.205(t)(3) 
(89 FR 1227). We stated that we would 
continue monitoring the development of 
standards for case reporting, and that as 
FHIR-based standards advanced we 
intended to transition solely to a FHIR- 
based approach for case reporting in 
future rulemaking (89 FR 1227). We also 
stated in the HTI–1 Final Rule, in 
response to comments that technology 
used by public health agencies may not 
be able to accept incoming FHIR-based 
reports, that we understood 
commenters’ ‘‘concerns related to 
performance, scalability, and 
maintenance, and will monitor 
standards development and 
implementation to inform future 
rulemaking’’ (89 FR 1229). 
Consistent with E.O. 14192, ASTP/ 
ONC published the ‘‘Electronic Case 
Reporting Certification Criterion 
Enforcement Discretion Notice’’ on July 
31, 2025.

The enforcement discretion

remains conformant with either 
§ 170.315(f)(5)(i) or with requirements 
in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii) as specified in the 
notice. The requirements in 
§ 170.315(f)(5)(ii) specified in the 
enforcement discretion notice include 
requirements to: consume and process 
case reporting trigger codes and identify 
a reportable patient visit or encounter 
based on a match with a trigger code 
value set (e.g., table); create a case report; receive, consume, and process a 
case report response; and, transmit a 
case report electronically to a system 
capable of receiving a case report. 
Additionally, the enforcement 
discretion notice stated that for calendar 
year 2025, ASTP/ONC will not take any 
enforcement action against an ONC– 
ACB for certifying a Health IT Module 
that is presented for certification to 
§ 170.315(f)(5) where the Health IT 
Module demonstrates and maintains 
conformance with § 170.315(f)(5)(i) or 
the requirements in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii) as 
specified above. For calendar year 2026, 
the enforcement discretion notice stated 
that ASTP/ONC will not exercise its 
direct review authority for any non- 
conformity arising solely from certified 
health IT not complying with the 
standards in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii) as long as 
the health IT remains conformant with 
the requirements in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii) as 
specified above. The enforcement 
discretion notice also stated that for 
calendar year 2026, ASTP/ONC will not 
take any enforcement action against an 
ONC–ACB for certifying a Health IT 
Module that is presented for 
certification to § 170.315(f)(5) where the 
Health IT Module demonstrates and 
maintains conformance to the 
requirements in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii) as 
specified above. The enforcement 
discretion notice stated that it remains 
in effect until December 31, 2026, or 
until the Department completes a 
deregulatory action to revise 
§ 170.315(f)(5). 
We have reviewed and evaluated the 
transmission to public health agencies— 
electronic case reporting certification 
criterion in § 170.315(f)(5) with a focus 
on reducing burden while still 
supporting our policy priorities. We 
understand from developers of certified 
health IT that there may be issues with 
readiness to adopt these standards as 
well as concerns regarding the 
performance, scalability, or 
maintenance of these standards. We also 
note that the § 170.315(f)(5) certification 
criterion is required to complete the 
Electronic Case Reporting measure in 
the MIPS Promoting Interoperability 
performance category and the Medicare 
Promoting Interoperability Program.
46
 
We note that in the CY 2026 PFS Final 
Rule, CMS finalized a policy to suppress 
the measure for performance for MIPS 
eligible clinicians meeting the 
requirements of the MIPS Promoting 
Interoperability performance category 
for the CY 2025 performance period, 
and eligible hospitals and CAHs 
participating in the Medicare Promoting 
Interoperability Program for the EHR 
reporting period in CY 2025 (90 FR 
49892). 
We propose to revise the eCR 
certification criterion to be a functional 
requirement in order to reduce burden 
and allow for industry innovation. In 
particular, we propose to rescind the 
expiration date for the functional 
requirements defined in § 170.315(f)(5) 
as of the effective date of a subsequent 
final rule. We propose to revise the 
introductory text of the criterion to 
enable a user to create a case report for 
electronic transmission meeting the 
functional requirements described in 
paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section. 
Additionally, we propose to remove the 
standards-based requirements defined 
in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii) as of the effective 
date of a subsequent final rule and 
reserve that section. We welcome 
feedback on these proposals. 
c. Transmission to Public Health 
Agencies—Antimicrobial Use and 
Resistance Reporting 
We propose to revise the 
‘‘transmission to public health 
agencies—antimicrobial use and 
resistance reporting’’ certification 
criterion in § 170.315(f)(6). This 
criterion assesses whether Health IT 
Modules can create and properly format 
an antimicrobial use and resistance 
report for electronic transmission, 
following specified sections of a CDA- 
based implementation guide. In the 
2015 Edition Final Rule, we expanded 
the public health-related standards and 
certification criteria to include a new 
criterion for transmission of 
antimicrobial use and resistance 
reporting data to public health registries 
(80 FR 62668). We stated in the 2015 
Edition Final Rule that the antimicrobial 
use and resistance reporting data is only 
collected by CDC rather than at the 
jurisdictional level (80 FR 62668). The 
transmission to public health agencies— 
antimicrobial use and resistance 
reporting certification criterion 
currently references the Health Level 7 
(HL7

) Implementation Guide for CDA

 
Release 2—Level 3: Healthcare 
Associated Infection (HAI) Reports, 
Release 1, U.S. Realm, August 2013 
standard in § 170.205(r)(1) and only 
requires conformance to certain sections 
of the implementation guide. The 
§ 170.315(f)(6) certification criterion is 
required for completing the 
Antimicrobial Use Surveillance and 
Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance 
measures in the Medicare Promoting 
Interoperability Program for eligible 
hospitals and CAHs.
47
 
We have reviewed and evaluated the 
transmission to public health agencies— 
antimicrobial use and resistance 
reporting certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(f)(6) with a focus on achieving 
burden reduction while still supporting 
our policy goals. We have identified 
trends within the industry regarding a 
shift in reporting approach that supports 
revision of this criterion.
48
As CDC 
works to move reporting to FHIR-based 
standards,
49
we believe maintaining an 
outdated CDA-based standard in the 
criterion would impose regulatory 
burden on health IT developers that are 
seeking to support FHIR-based 
approaches to reporting. We propose to 
revise the criterion requirements to be 
functional only and remove the 
reference to the standard in 
§ 170.205(r)(1) as of the effective date of 
a subsequent final rule. This would 
reduce administrative and development 
burden by allowing progress in line 
with other use cases, the use of more 
recent standards, and modern 
approaches to reporting. We note that, 
as with other criteria that include solely 
functional requirements, use of a 
specific standard would not be required 
to meet the proposed requirements of 
the criterion. 
We believe that revising the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(f)(6) 
to functional requirements only would 
reduce burden and allow for standards 
advancement and adoption of FHIR- 
based reporting to move more quickly. 
We welcome feedback on these 
proposals. 
d. Transmission to Public Health 
Agencies—Health Care Surveys 
We propose to remove the 
‘‘transmission to public health 
agencies—health care surveys’’

certification criterion in § 170.315(f)(7) 
with an effective date of January 1, 
2027. This criterion supports the 
transmission of health care surveys 
directly to the CDC. In the 2015 Edition 
Final Rule, we expanded the public 
health-related standards and 
certification criteria to include a new 
criterion for transmission of health care 
surveys to public health agencies (80 FR 
62669). We clarified in the 2015 Edition 
Final Rule that the finalized 
implementation guide for this criterion 
is intended for the transmission of 
survey data for both the National 
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 
(NAMCS) and the National Hospital 
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 
(NHAMCS) (80 FR 62668). We also 
clarified that templates included in the 
implementation guide align with the 
CDA standard (80 FR 62668). We stated 
in the 2015 Edition Final Rule that data 
covered by this criterion will only be 
collected by the CDC rather than at the 
jurisdictional level (80 FR 62669). The 
certification criterion in § 170.315(f)(7) 
currently references the Health Level 7 
(HL7

) Implementation Guide for CDA

 
Release 2: National Health Care Surveys 
(NHCS), Release 1—US Realm, Draft 
Standard for Trial Use, December 2014 
standard in § 170.205(s)(1). We note that 
the § 170.315(f)(7) certification criterion 
is optional to complete the Public 
Health Registry measures in the MIPS 
Promoting Interoperability performance 
category and the Medicare Promoting 
Interoperability Program.
50
 
We have reviewed and evaluated the 
transmission to public health agencies— 
health care surveys certification 
criterion in § 170.315(f)(7) with a goal of 
reducing burden while still supporting 
our policy priorities. We are also 
seeking to align with CDC priorities 
around data modernization and 
encouraging the use of FHIR-based 
approaches. The removal of this 
criterion would encourage industry to 
modernize and scale their reporting 
approach alongside CDC’s efforts. 
We believe that removing the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(f)(7) 
would reduce burden while at the same 
time honor our policy goals to ensure 
health IT interoperability and 
functionality. Hospitals and clinicians 
have been actively submitting these 
surveys for over a decade and continue 
to meet the technical requirements set 
by CDC, even when these requirements 
outpace the certification criteria.
51
We 
propose a January 1, 2027, effective date 
for the removal of the transmission to 
public health agencies—health care 
surveys criterion in § 170.315(f)(7). We 
welcome feedback on these proposals. 
7. Design and Performance Certification 
Criteria 
a. Automated Numerator Recording 
In the 2015 Edition Final Rule (80 FR 
62669), we adopted a certification 
criterion in § 170.315(g)(1) that requires 
the capability to create a report or file 
that enables a user to review the 
patients or actions that would make the 
patient or action eligible to be included 
in the numerator of a percentage-based 
measure in the MIPS Promoting 
Interoperability performance category 
and the Medicare Promoting 
Interoperability Program. We first 
adopted this capability for the 2014 
edition in § 170.314(g)(1) to complement 
the ‘‘automated measure calculation’’ 
certification criterion to support the 
associated meaningful use objectives in 
the EHR Incentive Programs. In the 
Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25708), we 
updated the references to the EHR 
Incentive Programs in the criterion to 
reflect CMS’ updates to the name of the 
Programs, which are now the Medicare 
Promoting Interoperability Program and 
the MIPS Promoting Interoperability 
performance category. 
We propose to remove the ‘‘automated 
numerator recording’’ certification 
criterion and reserve § 170.315(g)(1). We 
have reviewed and evaluated the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(1), 
seeking to identify ways to reduce 
burden while still supporting our policy 
goals. Health IT developers that 
facilitate customer participation in the 
Medicare Promoting Interoperability 
Program and the MIPS Promoting 
Interoperability performance category 
have been supporting the recording of 
numerator data associated with the 
measures and its previous iterations for 
many years. CMS establishes the 
measures and provides any additional 
information about how the numerator 
should be recorded through rulemaking 
and subsequent communications. 
ASTP/ONC uses the measure 
specifications established by CMS to 
develop testing procedures for health IT 
developers to certify their products to 
the automated numerator recording 
certification criterion. Certification of 
health IT to record the actions of the 
numerator has played an important role 
in ensuring health IT developers 
consistently implemented the measures 
established by CMS. However, we 
believe that developers now have 
significant experience with 
implementing CMS requirements, and 
they will continue to ensure that the 
measures are recorded in a fashion that 
meets CMS requirements to ensure that 
their customers can successfully 
participate in the absence of additional 
testing requirements under the ONC 
Health IT Certification Program. If our 
removal of the automated numerator 
recording certification criterion is 
finalized as proposed, we will work 
with CMS to ensure relevant guidance 
and materials for existing measures is 
consolidated as part of the informational 
materials that CMS maintains regarding 
measures in the Medicare Promoting 
Interoperability Program and MIPS 
Promoting Interoperability performance 
category. 
We believe that removing the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(1) 
will reduce administrative burden, as 
well as burden for health IT developers 
and health care providers while still 
allowing us to achieve our policy goals. 
Because the certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(g)(1) is specified in the 
definitions of CEHRT established by 
CMS for the Medicare Promoting 
Interoperability Program (42 CFR 495.4) 
and the MIPS Promoting 
Interoperability performance category 
(42 CFR 414.1305), we believe that a 
transition date is needed. Therefore, we 
propose to remove the automated 
numerator recording certification 
criterion as of January 1, 2027, and 
reserve § 170.315(g)(1). We welcome 
comments on this proposal. 
b. Automated Measure Calculation 
In the 2015 Edition Final Rule (80 FR 
62669 through 62670), we adopted the 
‘‘automated measure calculation’’ 
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(2) 
that requires the capability to record the 
numerator and denominator and create 
a report including the numerator, 
denominator, and resulting percentage 
associated with each applicable measure 
in the Medicare Promoting 
Interoperability Program and the MIPS 
Promoting Interoperability performance 
category. This capability was first 
adopted as a 2011 Edition certification 
criterion to support the associated 
meaningful use stage 1 objectives and 
subsequently adopted in the 2014 
Edition in § 170.314(g)(2) (77 FR 54184). 
In the Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 
25708), we updated the references to the 
EHR Incentive Programs in the 
certification criterion to reflect CMS’ 
updated names for the Medicare 
Promoting Interoperability Program and 
the MIPS Promoting Interoperability

http://www.nist.gov/manuscript-publication- 
search.cfm?pub_id=907312. performance category. In the HTI–2 
Final Rule (89 FR 101809), we 
inadvertently removed and reserved 
§ 170.315(g)(2) due to an amendatory 
instruction drafting error. We corrected 
this error through a technical correction 
in the HTI–4 Final Rule published on 
August 4, 2025, which was included in 
the CY26 CMS IPPS/LTCH PPS Final 
Rule as a rider (90 FR 37182). 
We now propose to remove the 
‘‘automated measure calculation’’ 
certification criterion and reserve 
§ 170.315(g)(2) with an effective date of 
January 1, 2027. We have reviewed and 
evaluated the certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(g)(2), seeking to identify ways 
to reduce burden while still supporting 
our policy goals. As with the automated 
numerator recording certification 
criterion discussed above, health IT 
developers that facilitate customer 
participation in the Medicare Promoting 
Interoperability Program and the MIPS 
Promoting Interoperability performance 
category have been supporting the 
calculation of measures in the program 
and its previous iterations for many 
years. CMS establishes these measures 
and provides any additional information 
about how the measures should be 
calculated through rulemaking and 
subsequent program communications. 
ASTP/ONC uses the measure 
specifications established by CMS to 
develop testing procedures for health IT 
developers to certify their products to 
the automated measure calculation 
certification criterion. Certification of 
health IT for measure calculation has 
played an important role in ensuring 
health IT developers consistently 
implemented the measures established 
by CMS. However, we believe that 
developers now have significant 
experience with implementing CMS 
requirements, and that they will 
continue to ensure that the measures are 
calculated in a fashion that meets CMS 
requirements to ensure that their 
customers can successfully participate 
in the absence of additional testing 
requirements under the Certification 
Program. If our removal of the 
automated measure calculation 
certification criterion is finalized as 
proposed, we will work with CMS to 
ensure relevant guidance and materials 
for existing measures is consolidated as 
part of the informational materials that 
CMS maintains regarding measures in 
the Medicare Promoting Interoperability 
Program and MIPS Promoting 
Interoperability performance category. 
We believe that removing the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(2) 
will reduce administrative burden for 
health IT developers that support 
customer participation in the Medicare 
Promoting Interoperability Program and 
MIPS Promoting Interoperability 
performance category. Because the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(2) 
is specified in the definitions of CEHRT 
in 42 CFR 414.1305 and 495.4 and 
currently required for reporting of 
Promoting Interoperability measures, we 
believe that a transition date is needed. 
Therefore, we propose to remove and 
reserve the automated measure 
calculation certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(g)(2) as of January 1, 2027. We 
welcome comments on this proposal. 
c. Safety Enhanced Design 
We propose to remove the ‘‘safety- 
enhanced design’’ certification criterion 
in § 170.315(g)(3) and the reference to 
this certification criterion in 
§ 170.550(g)(1) as of the effective date of 
a final rule for this proposed rule. The 
safety-enhanced design certification 
criterion specifies the user-centered 
design (UCD) testing that must be 
applied to certain health IT capabilities 
submitted for certification. Certification 
to this certification criterion is 
conditional as its scope and 
applicability depends on the other 
certification criteria for which a Health 
IT Module is presented for certification. 
Section 170.315(g)(3) prescribes specific 
requirements for how certified 
capabilities are designed or made 
available to users. For example, during 
the design and development of certified 
health IT, developers are required to 
apply UCD processes to the capabilities 
reference in § 170.315(g)(3). This 
certification criterion is not included in 
the Base EHR definition in § 170.102 or 
the definition of CEHRT established by 
CMS in 42 CFR 414.1305 and 42 CFR 
495.4. 
In the 2014 Edition Proposed Rule (77 
FR 13842), we provided an overview of 
the International Organization for 
Standardization’s (ISO) definition of 
usability and outlined that EHR 
technology certification could introduce 
some improvements that we believed 
would enhance both the safety and 
efficiency of CEHRT. This position 
mirrored statements made by interested 
parties regarding a gap between optimal 
usability and the usability offered by 
some EHR technologies at that time. In 
November 2011, the Institute of 
Medicine (IOM) called on the Secretary 
of HHS to specify the quality and risk 
management process requirements that 
health IT vendors must adopt, with a 
particular focus on human factors, 
safety culture, and usability. In the 2014 
Edition Proposed Rule, we proposed to 
focus on the process of UCD to improve 
overall usability. We prioritized eight 
certification criteria
52
and associated 
capabilities to which the proposed 
certification criterion would require 
UCD to be applied. We chose these eight 
because we believed they posed the 
greatest risk for patient harm, and 
therefore, the greatest opportunity for 
error prevention. We also noted that the 
methods for how an EHR technology 
developer could employ UCD are well 
defined in documents and requirements 
such as ISO 9241–11, ISO 13407, ISO 
16982, and NISTIR 7741. Our proposed 
approach sought to enable EHR 
technology developers to choose their 
UCD approach and not to prescribe 
specific UCD processes that would be 
required to meet this certification 
criterion. We also proposed in the 2014 
Edition Proposed Rule (77 FR 13843), 
that testing to this certification criterion 
would require EHR technology 
developers to document that their UCD 
incorporates all the data elements 
defined in the Customized Common 
Industry Format Template for EHR 
Usability Testing (NISTIR 7742).
53
We 
noted that with respect to demonstrating 
compliance with this certification 
criterion that this information would 
need to be available to an ONC–ACB for 
review. Finally, we indicated that this 
documentation would become a 
component of the publicly available 
testing results on which a certification 
is based. 
In the 2014 Edition Final Rule (77 FR 
54187 through 54190), we adopted 
§ 170.314(g)(3) as proposed, specifying 
that UCD must be applied to each 
capability of an EHR technology that is 
associated with the eight certification 
criteria named in the safety-enhanced 
design certification criterion. In 
addition, we finalized that the 
information from the NISTIR 7742 was 
required to be submitted for each of the 
criteria specified in the 2014 Edition 
safety-enhanced design certification 
criterion. 
In the 2014 Edition Release 2 Final 
Rule, we revised the safety-enhanced 
design certification criterion in to 
include three CPOE certification criteria 
(79 FR 54436) and the clinical 
information reconciliation and 
incorporation (CIRI) certification 
criterion (79 FR 54439). 
In the 2015 Edition Proposed Rule (80 
FR 16856), we proposed to adopt a 2015 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:47 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\29DEP2.SGM 29DEP2

Edition safety-enhanced design 
certification criterion that reflected 
updates to the 2014 Edition safety- 
enhanced design criterion. We proposed 
to include 17 certification criteria (seven 
of which were new) in the 2015 Edition 
safety-enhanced design certification 
criterion. For each of the referenced 
certification criteria and their 
corresponding capabilities presented for 
certification, we proposed to require 
that UCD processes must be applied to 
satisfy the certification criterion. For the 
2015 Edition safety-enhanced design 
criterion, we further proposed to add 
more specificity around requirements 
for the information that must be 
provided to demonstrate compliance 
with this certification criterion. For 
instance, we proposed in 
§ 170.315(g)(3)(ii) that information must 
be submitted on the specific UCD 
processes used. We further proposed in 
§ 170.315(g)(3)(iii) that a health IT 
developer must submit information 
about and findings of the UCD testing 
conducted for each of the criteria 
specified in the 2015 Edition safety- 
enhanced design certification criterion. 
We proposed that this information 
would become part of the test results 
publicly available on CHPL. 
In the 2015 Edition Final Rule (80 FR 
62670), we adopted the proposed safety- 
enhanced design certification criterion 
with modifications. Modifications 
included adopting a reduced list of 
criteria for inclusion in the safety- 
enhanced design certification 
criterion
54
and adopting the 
requirement that ONC–ACBs certify 
Health IT Modules to § 170.315(g)(3) 
consistent with the requirements 
included in the certification criterion. 
We anticipate the removal of this 
criterion would reduce costs and burden 
for health IT developers and health care 
providers. For example, when pursuing 
certification, health IT developers must 
recruit a minimum of ten participants, 
conduct the necessary testing, and 
submit metrics for each certification 
criterion, for which they seek 
certification, that is refenced within 
§ 170.315(g)(3). We refer readers to 
section VIII (Regulatory Impact 
Analysis) of this proposed rule for more 
detailed information on cost estimates 
of safety-enhanced design and potential 
cost savings. In addition to reducing 
costs and burden for health IT 
developers, we anticipate that removing 
this certification criterion would allow 
health IT developers to redirect time 
and resources towards more innovative 
approaches to support and improve 
safety-enhanced design in their 
products. Additionally, we no longer 
believe that this certification criterion 
provides the same benefit to the 
regulatory burden profile that it did 
when first adopted over ten years ago. 
In contrast, its presence in the 
Certification Program has led to 
instances where administrative 
processes to fulfill its requirements have 
delayed health IT developers from 
achieving product certifications without 
added improvements in user-centered 
design. In short, this certification 
criterion’s impact has diminished since 
it was first adopted. Moreover, 
compared to its burden, we have seen 
little use of the transparent reporting 
associated with this certification 
criterion (§ 170.523(f)(1)(xix)). 
Consistent with E.O. 14192, 
‘‘Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation,’’ and the reasons we 
stated above, we believe it is 
appropriate to remove this certification 
criterion. Therefore, we propose to 
remove the safety-enhanced design 
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(3) 
and the reference to this certification 
criteria in § 170.550(g)(1) as of the 
effective date of a subsequent final rule. 
We welcome comments on our 
proposal. 
d. Quality Management System 
We propose to remove the ‘‘quality 
management system’’ (QMS) 
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(4) 
and the reference to this certification 
criteria in § 170.550(g)(2) as of the 
effective date of a final rule for this 
proposed rule. The QMS certification 
criterion states for each capability that 
a technology includes and for which 
that capability’s certification is sought, 
the use of a QMS in the development, 
testing, implementation, and 
maintenance of that capability must be 
identified and satisfied in one of the 
following ways: either the QMS used is 
established by the Federal government 
or a standards developing organization 
(SDO) or the QMS used is mapped to 
one or more QMS established by the 
Federal government or SDOs. Per 
§ 170.550(g), this certification criterion 
is mandatory for all certified Health IT 
Modules. 
The 2014 Edition Proposed Rule (77 
FR 13842) referenced a report by the 
Institute of Medicine (IOM) in which 
IOM recommended that we ‘‘[establish] 
quality management principles and 
processes in health IT.’’ Accordingly, 
we stated that we were considering 
including in the final rule an additional 
certification criterion that would require 
an EHR technology developer to 
document how their EHR technology 
development processes either align 
with, or deviate from, certain quality 
management principles and processes 
(77 FR 13843). 
In the 2014 Edition Final Rule, we 
adopted a new quality management 
system certification criterion in 
§ 170.314(g)(4) that was intended as a 
first step to focus on QMS and build on 
it in an incremental fashion (77 FR 
54191). We finalized that all EHR 
technology certified to the 2014 Edition 
certification criteria would need to be 
certified to this certification criterion. In 
addition, we revised § 170.550 to 
require that, when certifying EHR 
Modules to the 2014 Edition EHR 
certification criteria, ONC–ACBs must 
certify EHR Modules to this certification 
criterion. 
In the 2015 Edition Proposed Rule (80 
FR 16858), we proposed a revised 
version of the QMS certification 
criterion in § 170.315(g)(4). We 
proposed to require the identification of 
the QMS used in the development, 
testing, implementation, and 
maintenance of capabilities certified 
under the Certification Program. We 
proposed that for a Health IT Module to 
be certified, the identified QMS must be 
compliant with a quality management 
system established by the Federal 
government or an SDO, or mapped to 
one or more quality management 
systems established by the Federal 
government or SDOs. In the 2015 
Edition Final Rule (80 FR 62672), we 
adopted the proposed version of the 
QMS certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(g)(4). In addition, we revised 
§ 170.550 to require ONC–ACBs to 
certify Health IT Modules to the new 
criterion in § 170.315(g)(4) when 
certifying to the 2015 Edition. 
When we initially proposed this 
certification criterion in the 2014 
Edition Proposed Rule, we understood 
that some EHR technology developers 
already had quality management 
principles and processes in place, but 
we did not believe, especially 
considering the IOM recommendation, 
that the EHR technology industry 
consistently followed such processes. 
Since the adoption of the QMS 
certification criterion, we find that 
industry and other interested parties 
now widely employ quality 
management principles. As an example,

an ISO 9001-certified quality 
management system provides a 
structured set of requirements designed 
to support quality-focused business 
operations.
55
The ISO Survey 2023
56
 
showed that 26,833 ISO 9001 
certificates were issued in the U.S., 
demonstrating widespread adoption 
across diverse industries. Given these 
advances across industry, we have 
determined that this certification 
criterion, and program requirements 
that all Health IT Modules be certified 
to the criterion, have become 
duplicative. Therefore, we propose to 
remove the criterion in § 170.315(g)(4) 
and the reference to this certification 
criterion in § 170.550(g)(2) as of the 
effective date of a subsequent final rule. 
We welcome comments on our 
proposal. 
e. Accessibility-Centered Design 
We propose to remove the 
‘‘accessibility-centered design’’ (ACD) 
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(5) 
and the reference to this certification 
criteria in § 170.550(g)(3) as of the 
effective date of a final rule for this 
proposed rule. This certification 
criterion requires that all developers of 
Health IT Modules identify and use a 
health IT accessibility-centered design 
standard or law in the development, 
testing, implementation and 
maintenance of each capability for 
which certification is sought. The 
removal of this certification criterion, if 
finalized, would not exempt health IT 
developers and providers from their 
independent obligations under 
applicable federal civil rights laws, 
including Section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act, Section 1557 of the 
Affordable Care Act, and the Americans 
with Disabilities Act. The requirements 
of these civil rights laws include, but are 
not limited to, providing individuals 
with disabilities equal access to 
information and appropriate auxiliary 
aids and services as provided in the 
applicable statutes and regulations. 
In the 2015 Edition Proposed Rule, we 
proposed a new accessibility-centered 
design certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(g)(8) (80 FR 16861). We 
proposed that this criterion would 
require the identification of user- 
centered design standard(s) or laws for 
accessibility that were applied, or 
complied with, in the development of 
specific capabilities included in a 
Health IT Module or, alternatively, the 
lack of such application or compliance. 
We proposed to require that for each 
capability that a Health IT Module 
includes, and for which that capability’s 
certification is sought, the use of a 
health IT accessibility-centered design 
standard or compliance with a health IT 
accessibility law in the development, 
testing, implementation, and 
maintenance of that capability must be 
identified. We also proposed that the 
method(s) used to meet this proposed 
certification criterion would be reported 
through the open data CHPL and we 
proposed to revise § 170.550 to require 
ONC–ACBs to certify all Health IT 
Modules certified to the 2015 Edition to 
the accessibility-centered design 
certification criterion. 
The 2015 Edition Final Rule adopted 
the accessibility-centered design (ACD) 
certification criterion as proposed, 
moving it to § 170.315(g)(5) (80 FR 
62673). Additionally, we finalized in 
§ 170.550 that ONC–ACBs must certify 
all 2015 Edition Health IT Modules to 
the criterion in § 170.315(g)(5). 
In the 2015 Edition Proposed Rule we 
explained that the proposed 
certification criterion would serve to 
increase transparency around the 
application of user-centered design 
standards for accessibility to health IT 
and the compliance of health IT with 
accessibility laws (80 FR 16861). We 
stated that this transparency would 
benefit health care providers, 
consumers, government entities, and 
other stakeholders, and would 
encourage health IT developers to 
pursue the application of more 
accessibility standards and laws in 
product development that could lead to 
improved usability for health care 
providers with disabilities and health 
care outcomes for patients with 
disabilities. Since the adoption of this 
certification criterion, we find that 
industry and other interested parties 
have readily adopted this application of 
user-centered design as an industry 
standard. For instance, according to 
CHPL data, as of August 2025, every 
single active Certified Health IT Module 
(721 total) was certified to 
§ 170.315(g)(5). The proposed removal 
of this certification criterion would 
reduce the effort of health IT developers 
to meet ongoing program requirements 
that duplicate widely adopted 
accessibility-centered design practices, 
allowing developers to refocus these 
resources on innovation and meeting 
the needs of their clients and end users 
in other areas. 
Therefore, we propose to remove the 
accessibility-center design certification 
criterion in § 170.315(g)(5) and the 
reference to this certification criterion in 
§ 170.550(g)(3) as of the effective date of 
a final rule for this proposed rule. As 
stated earlier, the removal of this 
certification criterion, if finalized as 
proposed, would not exempt health IT 
developers and providers from their 
independent obligations under 
applicable federal civil rights laws, 
including but not limited to, providing 
individuals with disabilities equal 
access to information and appropriate 
auxiliary aids and services. We welcome 
comments on our proposal. 
f. Consolidated CDA Creation 
Performance 
We propose to remove the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(6) 
and reserve that section. We also 
propose to remove § 170.550(g)(4) which 
references the criterion, as described 
elsewhere in this proposed rule. The 
‘‘Consolidated CDA creation 
performance’’ certification criterion 
helps to ensure the proper conformance 
of Consolidated CDAs (C–CDAs) for 
transition of care and referral summaries 
that are sent to and received from 
external organizations. In the 2015 
Edition Final Rule, we adopted a new 
Consolidated CDA creation performance 
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(6) 
that assesses a product’s C–CDA 
creation performance if the Health IT 
Module is presented for certification 
with C–CDA creation capabilities within 
its scope (80 FR 62674). In the HTI–1 
Final Rule, we updated the associated 
standards (89 FR 1224). 
We have stated elsewhere in this 
proposed rule that while C–CDA-based 
standards are still in use, the industry 
is shifting toward adoption of FHIR- 
based standards, which are designed to 
enable greater interoperability and 
innovation. We believe that maintaining 
the current level of support for this and 
other C–CDA-based criteria, including 
putting effort and resources toward 
testing and certification, can detract 
from industry efforts to move toward 
FHIR-based solutions. We believe that 
removing the Consolidated CDA 
creation performance certification 
criterion in § 170.315(g)(6) would 
contribute to reducing the effort health 
IT developers and health care providers 
are focusing on C–CDA support and 
allow for redirection of efforts toward 
greater use of FHIR-based standards in 
health IT. We propose to remove the 
Consolidated CDA creation performance 
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(6) 
as of the effective date of a subsequent 
final rule. We welcome feedback on 
these proposals. 
g. Application Access—Patient 
Selection

See the CY 2026 PFS Proposed Rule Table 62, available at https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2025- 
13271/p-3055 and the FY2026 IPPS/LTCH PPS Final Rule Table X.F.–05 available at https://
www.federalregister.gov/d/2025-14681/p-4161. 
access—patient selection’’ certification 
criterion in § 170.315(g)(7) that includes 
the capability to receive a request with 
sufficient information to uniquely 
identify a patient and return an ID or 
other token that can be used by an 
application to subsequently execute 
requests for that patient’s data. 
We propose to remove the application 
access—patient selection criterion and 
reserve § 170.315(g)(7) as of January 1, 
2027. We have reviewed and evaluated 
the certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(g)(7), seeking to identify ways 
to reduce burden while still supporting 
our policy goals. We refer readers to 
section I.A.2.b for detailed discussion 
on ‘‘America’s FHIR-Forward Future.’’ 
Given our increased focus on standards- 
based APIs in the Certification Program, 
we believe it is appropriate to remove 
this functional API criterion at this time. 
Specifically, since adoption of the 
SMART App Launch Implementation 
Guide in § 170.215(c) all Health IT 
Modules certified to the standardized 
API for patient and population services 
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(10) 
must support the functional 
requirement described in 
§ 170.315(g)(7)(i) according to the 
SMART App Launch Implementation 
Guide. Further, we are also proposing 
elsewhere in this proposed rule to 
remove a corresponding certification 
criterion in § 170.315(g)(9). Should we 
finalize removal of the certification 
criterion in § 170.315(g)(9), the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(7) 
would lose its intended utility. We 
believe that reducing compliance 
burdens for health IT developers that 
participate in the Certification Program 
would foster industry innovation and 
encourage the development of more 
creative interoperability solutions. We 
have similarly also removed the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(8) 
via a technical correction in the HTI–4 
Final Rule (90 FR 37182), which was 
published in tandem with the FY2026 
IPPS/LTCH PPS Final Rule (90 FR 
36536). We had intended to remove 
§ 170.315(g)(8) in the HTI–2 Final Rule, 
but mistakenly removed § 170.315(g)(2) 
instead due to an amendatory 
instruction drafting instruction error. 
We corrected this error in the HTI–4 
Final Rule. 
The application access—patient 
selection certification criterion is 
included in the Base EHR definition in 
§ 170.102. The criterion is also 
associated with measures under the 
Provider to Patient Exchange and Health 
Information Exchange objectives of the 
Medicare Promoting Interoperability 
Program and the MIPS Promoting 
Interoperability performance category. 
Accordingly, we believe that a transition 
date is needed for the removal of this 
measure, if our proposal is finalized, 
that would allow CMS to make 
appropriate program adjustments. 
Therefore, we propose to remove the 
application access—all data request 
certification criterion as of January 1, 
2027, and reserve § 170.315(g)(7). 
We believe that removing the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(7) 
will reduce administrative burden as 
well as burden for health IT developers 
and health care providers while still 
allowing us to achieve our policy goals. 
We welcome comments on this 
proposal. 
h. Application Access—All Data 
Request 
In the 2015 Edition Final Rule (80 FR 
62602), we established the ‘‘application 
access—all data request’’ certification 
criterion at § 170.315(g)(9) that requires 
the capability to respond to requests for 
patient data for all of the data classes 
expressed in the standards in § 170.213. 
In the Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 
25642), we revised § 170.315(g)(9) to 
add requirements for the USCDI and 
remove support for the CCDS by a 
specified date. In the HTI–1 Final Rule 
(89 FR 1192), we made revisions to 
support USCDI v2 and v3 updates and 
changes to data classes and constituent 
data elements for C–CDA and C–CDA 
2.1 Companion Guide. 
We propose to remove the application 
access—all data request certification 
criterion in § 170.315(g)(9) as of January 
1, 2027. We have reviewed and 
evaluated the certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(g)(9), seeking to identify ways 
to reduce burden for health IT 
developers and health care providers 
while still supporting our policy goals. 
As we have stated in the above section 
on our proposal to remove 
§ 170.315(g)(7) and in section I.A.2.b of 
this rule, we are increasing focus on 
standards-based APIs, and we believe it 
is appropriate to remove this functional 
API criterion at this time. We believe 
the functionality of the criterion has 
been widely adopted (as discussed in 
section III.A) among health IT 
developers and is not likely to go away 
as a supported functionality solely 
because of removal from the 
Certification Program. We also believe 
that removing this certification criterion 
could spur further industry innovation 
and support the development of more 
creative interoperability solutions. 
We believe that removing the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(9) 
will reduce administrative burden as 
well as burden for health IT developers 
and health care providers by eliminating 
the need for developers of certified 
health IT to certify to the certification 
criterion in § 170.315(g)(9). Because the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(9) 
is associated with measures under the 
Provider to Patient Exchange and Health 
Information Exchange objectives of the 
Medicare Promoting Interoperability 
Program and the MIPS Promoting 
Interoperability performance category, 
we believe that a transition date is 
needed.
57
Therefore, we propose to 
remove the application access—all data 
request certification criterion as of 
January 1, 2027 and reserve 
§ 170.315(g)(9). We welcome comments 
on this proposal. 
8. Transport Methods and Other 
Protocols Certification Criteria 
a. Direct Project 
In the 2015 Edition Final Rule (80 FR 
62602), we adopted a revised 
certification criterion in § 170.315(h)(1) 
that includes the capability to send and 
receive according to the Applicability 
Statement for Secure Health Transport 
(the primary Direct Project 
specification). We previously adopted 
this capability across different 
certification criteria as the 2014 Edition 
EHR Certification Criteria were 
maintained at § 170.314(b)(1), (b)(2), and 
(h)(1). 
We propose to remove the ‘‘transport 
methods and other protocols—direct 
project’’ certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(h)(1) as of the effective date of 
a final rule. We have reviewed and 
evaluated the certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(h)(1), seeking to identify ways 
to reduce burden while still supporting 
our policy goals. We believe that 
because this certification criterion was 
included as part of the 2014 Base EHR 
definition, the 2015 Base EHR definition 
(subsequently renamed the Base EHR 
definition), the functionality of this 
certification criterion has been widely 
adopted (as discussed in section III.A) 
among health IT developers and is not 
likely to go away as a supported 
functionality solely because of removal 
from the Certification Program. We no 
longer believe there is added benefit to 
include conformance testing for this 
functionality in the Certification 
Program as it is widely relied on and 
supported in the health care industry 
and would be incorporated in health IT 
absent the certification criterion. We 
further believe that removing this 
certification criterion could spur further

USCDI-Version-3-1_2025_508.pdf. industry innovation by enabling health 
IT developers to redirect investment in 
certification and testing for this criterion 
to new areas. 
We believe the removal of this 
certification criterion will reduce 
administrative burden and costs 
associated with certification for health 
IT developers and health care providers 
by eliminating the need for developers 
of certified health IT to certify to the 
certification criterion in § 170.315(h)(1) 
without substantially impacting our 
broader policy goals around 
interoperability and exchange and will 
allow for further innovation and 
development. Therefore, we propose to 
remove the transport methods and other 
protocols—direct project certification 
criterion in § 170.315(h)(1) as of the 
effective date of a subsequent final rule. 
We welcome comments on this 
proposal. 
b. Direct Project, Edge Protocol, and 
XDR/XDM 
In the 2015 Edition final rule we 
adopted a variation of the 
§ 170.315(h)(1) certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(h)(2) to accommodate 
implementation differences. This 
certification criterion combined three 
standards conformance requirements 
(the primary Direct standard, the edge 
protocol, and XDR/XDM handling). We 
propose to remove the ‘‘transport 
methods and other protocols—Direct 
Project, Edge Protocol, and XDR/XDM’’ 
certification criterion in § 170.315(h)(2) 
as of the effective date of a subsequent 
final rule. We have reviewed and 
evaluated the certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(h)(2), seeking to identify ways 
to reduce burden while still supporting 
our policy goals. Similar to 
§ 170.315(h)(1), we believe the 
functionality of this certification 
criterion has been widely adopted (as 
discussed in section III.A) among health 
IT developers and is not likely to go 
away as a supported functionality solely 
because of removal from the 
Certification Program, since it has been 
part of the 2014 Edition Base EHR 
definition, and 2015 Edition Base EHR 
definition (renamed the Base EHR 
definition), and the current criterion has 
not substantively changed since it was 
adopted in the 2015 Edition Final Rule. 
We further believe that removing this 
criterion could spur further industry 
innovation in this area by allowing for 
greater flexibility and reduced burden 
and costs from the need to certify to the 
certification criterion. Because removing 
§§ 170.315(h)(1)–(2) would remove all of 
the certification criteria under 
§ 170.315(h), we propose to remove and 
reserve § 170.315(h) in its entirety. We 
welcome comments on this proposal. 
B. Standards and Implementation 
Specifications for Health Information 
Technology 
1. United States Core Data for 
Interoperability Version 3.1 Update 
(USCDI v3.1) 
The USCDI standard in § 170.213 is a 
baseline set of data that can be 
commonly exchanged across care 
settings for a wide range of uses. Certain 
certification criteria in the Certification 
Program currently require the use of one 
of the versions of the USCDI standard in 
§ 170.213. We established USCDI as a 
standard in the Cures Act Final Rule (85 
FR 25670), adopting USCDI Version 1 
(USCDI v1) in § 170.213 and 
incorporating it by reference in 
§ 170.299. USCDI is also referenced by 
HHS programs and used by the health 
care community to align interoperability 
requirements and national priorities for 
health IT across industry initiatives. For 
the overall structure and organization of 
USCDI, including data classes and data 
elements, please see www.healthIT.gov/ 
USCDI. 
We published the ‘‘USCDI v3 Data 
Elements Enforcement Discretion 
Notice,’’
58
on March 21, 2025, which 
stated that ASTP/ONC is exercising 
enforcement discretion, and issued 
certification guidance for the 
Certification Program. Specifically, 
under this enforcement discretion 
notice and certification guidance, we 
stated that ASTP/ONC will not take any 
enforcement action under 45 CFR 
170.565 against an ONC–ACB based on 
non-compliance with 45 CFR 170.550 
for certifying a Health IT Module that is 
presented for certification to a 
certification criterion or criteria in 45 
CFR 170.315 that cross-references 
USCDI v3, where the Health IT Module: 
1. Does not demonstrate the capability 
to categorize data on individuals based 
on either or both of the following data 
elements: 
€Sexual orientation; and €Gender identity; or 2. Only demonstrates the capability to 
categorize data on individuals for the 
sex data element in accordance with the 
following SNOMED CT

codes: 
€248152002 | Female (finding) |; and €248153007 | Male (finding) |. Additionally, under this enforcement 
discretion notice and certification 
guidance, we stated that ASTP/ONC 
will not take any enforcement action 
under 45 CFR 170.565 against an ONC– 
ACB based on non-compliance with 45 
CFR 170.550 for certifying a Health IT 
Module that is presented for 
certification to the ‘‘patient 
demographics and observations’’ 
certification criterion (45 CFR 
170.315(a)(5)), where the Health IT 
Module: 
1. Does not demonstrate conformance 
with any or all of the following data and 
observations in paragraph (a)(5)(i): sex 
parameter for clinical use, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, name to 
use, and pronouns; or 
2. Does not demonstrate conformance 
with any or all of the following 
paragraphs of (a)(5)(i): (D) (‘‘sexual 
orientation’’), (E) (‘‘gender identity’’), (F) 
(‘‘sex parameter for clinical use’’), (G) 
(‘‘name to use’’), and (H) (‘‘pronouns’’); 
or 
3. Only demonstrates, for 
conformance with paragraph (a)(5)(i)(C) 
(‘‘sex’’), that it can record sex in 
accordance with either the standard 
specified in § 170.207(n)(1) for the 
period up to and including December 
31, 2025, or the following SNOMED 
CT

codes found in the standard 
specified in § 170.207(n)(2): 
€248152002 | Female (finding) |; and €248153007 | Male (finding) |. We stated that ASTP/ONC will not 
exercise its direct review authority 
under 45 CFR 170.580 for any non- 
conformity, potential or actual, that 
arises solely from a Health IT Module 
not demonstrating the capabilities 
specified above or for only 
demonstrating the limited specified 
capabilities above, as applicable, for the 
relevant certification criteria 
requirements. 
We also stated that this enforcement 
discretion notice, and certification 
guidance will remain in effect for twelve 
(12) months from the date of this notice 
or until HHS completes a regulatory 
action to revise the applicable 
regulations, whichever comes first. 
In June 2025, we published the USCDI 
v3.1,
59
which removes or updates from 
USCDI v3 the data elements for Sex, 
Sexual Orientation, and Gender Identity 
in the Patient Demographics/ 
Information Data Class. We propose to 
adopt USCDI v3.1 in § 170.213(a) and 
incorporate it by reference in § 170.299. 
The removal of data elements from 
USCDI v3 reflected in USCDI v3.1 aligns 
with our other proposals related to 
§ 170.315(a)(5) (see section III.A.1.a), 
resulting in burden reduction for health 
IT developers and cost savings 
associated with the enforcement 
discretion and ongoing maintenance 
requirements over time. In addition,

uploads/2020/07/revised_circular_a-119_as_of_1_22.pdf. 
these data elements (e.g., sexual orientation and gender identity) do not 
support the meeting of specific 
measures under the Medicare Promoting 
Interoperability Program or the MIPS 
Promoting Interoperability performance 
category, and are therefore not essential 
for inclusion in certified health IT that 
is used to meet the CEHRT definitions 
and support meeting measures under 
those programs. Therefore, we propose 
to remove USCDI v3 in § 170.213(b) and 
USCDI v1 in § 170.213(a) which expires 
on January 1, 2026. The effect of these 
proposals, if finalized in a subsequent 
final rule, would be that USCDI v3.1 
would be the only version of USCDI in 
§ 170.213. In other words, all Health IT 
Modules that cross-reference § 170.213 
would need to conform to USCDI v3.1 
as of the effective date of a subsequent 
final rule. Given that USCDI v3.1 is a 
reduction, rather than expansion, of 
required support for data elements, we 
do not anticipate that Health IT 
Modules that cross-reference § 170.213 
would require further development to 
conform to USCDI v3.1. 
We welcome comments on our 
proposals. 
a. National Technology Transfer and 
Advancement Act 
The National Technology Transfer 
and Advancement Act (NTTAA) of 1995 
(15 U.S.C. 3701 et. seq.) and the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) 
Circular A–119
60
require the use of, 
wherever practical, technical standards 
that are developed or adopted by 
voluntary consensus standards bodies to 
carry out policy objectives or activities, 
with certain exceptions. The NTTAA 
and OMB Circular A–119 provide 
exceptions to this general rule, namely 
when doing so would be inconsistent 
with applicable law or otherwise 
impractical. Agencies have the 
discretion to decline the use of existing 
voluntary consensus standards if it is 
determined that such standards are 
inconsistent with applicable law or 
otherwise impractical, and instead use a 
government-unique standard or other 
standard. In addition to the 
consideration of voluntary consensus 
standards, the OMB Circular A–119 
recognizes the contributions of 
standardization activities that take place 
outside of the voluntary consensus 
standards process. Therefore, in 
instances where use of voluntary 
consensus standards would be 
inconsistent with applicable law or 
otherwise impracticable, other 
standards should be considered that: 
meet the agency’s regulatory, 
procurement or program needs; deliver 
favorable technical and economic 
outcomes; and are widely utilized in the 
marketplace. In this proposed rule, we 
propose to use a government-unique 
standard which is the USCDI v3.1 
standard that we propose to adopt in 
§ 170.213. This standard is a hybrid of 
government policy (i.e., determining which data to include in the USCDI) 
and voluntary consensus standards (i.e., 
the vocabulary and code set standards 
attributed to USCDI data elements). 
We are not aware of any voluntary 
consensus standard that could serve as 
an alternative for the purposes we 
describe in further detail throughout 
this proposed rule, including for 
establishing a baseline set of data that 
can be commonly exchanged across care 
settings for a wide range of uses. 
b. ‘‘Reasonably Available’’ to Interested 
Parties 
The Office of the Federal Register has 
established requirements for materials 
(e.g., standards and implementation specifications) that agencies propose to 
incorporate by reference in the CFR (79 
FR 66267: 1 CFR 51.5(a)). To comply 
with these requirements, in section V 
(‘‘Incorporation by Reference’’) of this 
preamble, we provide a summary of, 
and a uniform resource location (URL) 
to, the USCDI standard we propose to 
adopt and subsequently incorporate by 
reference in the Code of Federal 
Regulations. To note, we also provide 
relevant information about the standard 
throughout the relevant sections of the 
proposed rule. 
2. Standards and Implementation 
Specifications 
As discussed above, we have 
proposed to remove or revise certain 
certification criteria in the Certification 
Program in an effort to reduce burden, 
offer flexibility to both developers and 
health care providers, as well as to 
support innovation. Included in certain 
certification criteria are references to 
standards. In those instances where we 
have proposed to remove the criterion, 
we also generally propose to remove the 
standard that is referenced from the 
CFR. Where the certification criterion is 
not removed as of the effective date of 
a final rule but allows time for transition 
until January 1, 2027, we generally 
propose to also remove those referenced 
standards on January 1, 2027. Only in 
limited circumstances do we retain a 
standard that is referenced in a 
certification criterion proposed for 
removal. 
We propose to remove the following 
standards as of the effective date of a 
subsequent final rule because they 
would no longer be referenced in 
certification criteria in the CFR: 
transport standards in § 170.202(b) 
through (e); functional standards in 
§ 170.204; content exchange standards 
in § 170.205(a)(3) and (5); vocabulary 
standards for representing electronic 
health information in § 170.207(r) and 
(s); and standards for health information 
technology to protect electronic health 
information created, maintained, and 
exchanged in § 170.210. We note that 
certain standards in § 170.210 may not 
be removed contingent on whether we 
finalize the alternative privacy and 
security proposal (see section III.A.4). 
We also propose to remove the 
following standards as of the effective 
date of a final rule since we propose to 
revise the associated certification 
criterion requirements to no longer 
reference the given standard: the 
content and exchange standard in 
§ 170.205(r)(1), including the specific 
document templates in § 170.205(r)(1)(i) 
through (iii). 
We propose to remove content 
exchange standards and implementation 
specifications referenced in certification 
criteria requirements that have expired 
in § 170.205(k)(1) and (2) from the CFR. 
We propose to remove API standards 
that expire on January 1, 2026, in 
§ 170.215(b)(1)(i) and (c)(1), and we also 
propose to remove and reserve outdated 
vocabulary standards in § 170.207(f)(2) 
and (m)(1). 
Where we propose to remove certain 
certification criteria after a transition 
period until January 1, 2027, we also 
propose to remove those standards from 
the CFR effective on January 1, 2027. 
Standards referenced in a certification 
criterion proposed for removal with a 
transition date of January 1, 2027, 
include content exchange standards in 
§ 170.205(i)(2), (t)(1) through (4), and 
(s)(1). We also propose to remove 
certain vocabulary standards in order to 
eliminate outdated standards that are no 
longer referenced or have expired. 
Therefore, we propose to remove 
vocabulary standards in § 170.207(a)(4), 
(c)(3), (e)(3) and (4). We also propose to 
remove vocabulary standards in 
§ 170.207(d)(1)(ii), (d)(1)(iii), (n)(1) and 
(3), and (o) from the CFR and reserve 
these subsections. 
We welcome comments on our 
proposals. Specifically, we request 
comment on whether we should retain 
any of the standards and 
implementation specifications proposed 
for removal because the standard or 
implementation specification should be 
required for purposes of health IT

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS261001 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Proposed Rules alignment, for instance, when acquiring, 
implementing or upgrading health IT 
systems and products consistent with 
sections 13111 and 13112 of the 
HITECH Act. 
In certain instances, we have not 
proposed to remove a standard even 
though we propose to remove the 
certification criterion where the 
standard is referenced. As noted, under 
section 3004 of the PHSA, we may 
adopt standards independently of 
associated criteria in the Certification 
Program. Standards adopted in 45 CFR 
170 subpart B may be referenced by 
other HHS programs and policies 
besides the Certification Program. For 
example, standards adopted in 45 CFR 
170 subpart B, regardless of whether 
they are associated with health IT 
certification criteria, are also required 
for use under sections 13111 and 13112 
of the HITECH Act when acquiring, 
implementing or upgrading health IT 
systems and products in certain 
instances. 
We do not propose to remove the 
standard in § 170.205(o), data 
segmentation for privacy, because some 
developers still rely on these standards, 
which allow health care providers to tag 
health care documents with privacy 
metadata. We also do not propose to 
remove the Direct Project transport 
standard in § 170.202(a)(2). We realize 
that the Direct Project standards are 
widely utilized in various use cases and 
emphasize that developers may still use 
these standards even if they are 
removed from certification criteria. We 
welcome comments on these proposals. 
We believe that keeping the primary 
Direct Project standard in 
§ 170.202(a)(2) but removing the other 
related standards and protocols in 
§ 170.202(b) through (e) from the 
Certification Program would 
acknowledge the current utilization of 
the Direct Project standard while 
recognizing the ongoing technological 
advancements related to transport, 
including movement toward FHIR-based 
standards, and would encourage and 
provide space for further innovation and 
market competition in this area. We 
propose a minor revision to 
§ 170.205(d)(2) to add the full name of 
the HL7 Messaging Standard Version 
2.5.1 standard. Lastly, we request 
comments on retaining the 
‘‘Applicability Statement for Secure 
Health Transport’’ requirement found in 
§ 170.315(h)(1)(i). 
C. Terms and Definitions 
Because of the proposed removal of 
certain certification criteria from 
§ 170.315 discussed above, we propose 
to make conforming edits to the terms 
and definitions in § 170.102. 
1. Base EHR 
We propose to make conforming 
revisions to the Base EHR definition in 
§ 170.102 based on our proposals to 
remove certification criteria from the 
CFR that are currently referenced in 
§ 170.102. The Base EHR definition 
provides a baseline assurance that 
certified health IT has been developed 
to possess, at a minimum, a key set of 
capabilities. We note the Base EHR 
definition is based on the ‘‘Qualified 
EHR’’ definition in section 3000(13) of 
the PHSA (77 FR 54262). As we noted 
recently, we have generally sought to 
limit the Base EHR definition to 
elements required for the Qualified EHR 
definition in PHSA section 3000 (90 FR 
37145). In section (3)(i) of the Base EHR 
definition, we propose to remove 
references to § 170.315(a)(14), (g)(7) and 
(9), and (h)(1) and (2). We propose to 
remove these certification criteria from 
the Base EHR definition because we 
have proposed to remove those 
certification criteria from the CFR. We 
also propose to move § 170.315(b)(11) to 
section (3)(i) of the definition and 
remove and reserve section (3)(ii) and 
remove section (3)(iii) because the 
transition date has passed. We welcome 
feedback on these proposals. 
2. Common Clinical Data Set 
We finalized in the Cures Act Final 
Rule that the CCDS would no longer be 
applicable for certified Health IT 
Modules 24 months after the 
publication date of the Cures Act Final 
Rule (85 FR 25671), and then extended 
that date to December 31, 2022, in the 
interim final rule titled ‘‘Information 
Blocking and the ONC Health IT 
Certification Program: Extension of 
Compliance Dates and Timeframes in 
Response to the COVID–19 Public 
Health Emergency’’ (85 FR 70073). 
Because § 170.315(b)(6)(ii)(A), which 
also referenced CCDS, was available for 
the period before December 31, 2023, 
we did not propose to remove the 
definition of CCDS in § 170.102 at that 
time. However, now that the date of 
December 31, 2023, has passed and we 
finalized the removal § 170.315(b)(6) in 
the HTI–2 Final Rule (89 FR 101776) 
and there are no longer any references 
to CCDS in 45 CFR part 170, we propose 
to remove the term Common Clinical 
Data Set in § 170.102. We welcome 
comments on these proposals. 
3. Global Unique Device Identification 
Database and Production Identifier 
In section III.A.1.d, we propose to 
remove the ‘‘implantable device list’’ 
certification criterion in § 170.315(a)(14) 
and reserve § 170.315(a)(14). The 
implantable device list certification 
criterion requires Health IT Modules 
certified to § 170.315(a)(14) to exchange, 
record, and allow a user to access a list 
of Unique Device Identifiers 
(UDIs) associated with a patient’s 
implantable devices. The only 
references to the Global Unique Device 
Identification Database and Production 
Identifier in 45 CFR part 170 are in 
§ 170.315(a)(14). Because we propose to 
remove § 170.315(a)(14), we propose to 
remove the definitions of Global Unique 
Device Identification Database and 
Production Identifier in § 170.102 too as 
the terms would no longer be referenced 
in any other section of 45 CFR part 170. 
We welcome comments on these 
proposals. 
D. Conditions and Maintenance of 
Certification Requirements for Health IT 
Developers 
1. Assurances 
Section 3001(c)(5) of the PHSA (42 
U.S.C. 300jj–11) (section 4002 of the 
Cures Act) requires that a health IT 
developer, as a Condition of 
Certification requirement under the 
Certification Program, provide 
assurances to the Secretary that, unless 
for legitimate purpose(s) as specified by 
the Secretary, the developer will not 
take any action that constitutes 
information blocking as defined in 
section 3022(a) of the PHSA or any 
other action that may inhibit the 
appropriate exchange, access, and use of 
EHI. In the Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 
25718), we implemented this provision 
through several Conditions of 
Certification and accompanying 
Maintenance of Certification 
requirements, which are set forth in 
§ 170.402. Because the transition dates 
in § 170.402(b)(2)(i) and (ii) have 
passed, we propose to revise the 
Maintenance of Certification 
requirements in § 170.402(b)(2) to 
remove the transition dates and only 
include that a health IT developer that 
must comply with the requirements of 
§ 170.402(a)(4) must provide all of its 
customers of certified health IT with the 
health IT certified to the certification 
criterion in § 170.315(b)(10). 
We also propose to make additional 
conforming edits to § 170.402(b). 
Because we propose to remove the 
requirements in § 170.315(b)(11)(iv) and 
(v) regarding source attribute support, 
access, and modification and in 
§ 170.315(b)(11)(vi) regarding 
intervention risk management for 
predictive DSIs, we also propose to 
remove § 170.402(b)(4), which requires

requirements-enforcement. 
health IT developers to review and 
update as necessary source attribute 
information and intervention risk 
management practices. We welcome 
feedback on these proposals. 
2. Application Programming Interfaces 
As a Condition of Certification 
requirement in section 3001(c)(5) of the 
PHSA (42 U.S.C. 300jj–11) (section 4002 
of the Cures Act), health IT developers 
are required to publish APIs that allow 
‘‘health information from such 
technology to be accessed, exchanged, 
and used without special effort through 
the use of application programming 
interfaces or successor technology or 
standards, as provided for under 
applicable law.’’ Section 4002 of the 
Cures Act also states that a developer 
must, through an API, ‘‘provid[e] access 
to all data elements of a patient’s 
electronic health record to the extent 
permissible under applicable privacy 
laws.’’ The Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 
25642) captured both the technical 
functionality and behaviors necessary to 
implement the Cures Act API Condition 
of Certification requirement. 
Specifically, we adopted new standards, 
new implementation specifications, a 
new certification criterion, and 
modified the Base EHR definition. In 
addition, we finalized detailed 
Condition and Maintenance of 
Certification requirements for health IT 
developers of certified health IT in 
§ 170.404. Because the transition dates 
in § 170.404(b)(2), (3), and (4) have 
passed, we propose to revise the 
Maintenance of Certification 
requirements in § 170.404(b). We 
propose to revise § 170.404(b)(2) to 
remove the date, and we propose to 
remove paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) 
entirely as they are outdated and, in the 
case of (b)(4) because it refers to 
certification criteria that we are 
proposing to remove. We also propose 
to revise § 170.404(c) to update 
certification criteria referenced in the 
‘‘Certified API technology’’ definition. 
We propose to remove the reference to 
‘‘§ 170.315(g)(7) through’’ and only keep 
§ 170.315(g)(10) in the ‘‘Certified API 
technology’’ definition because we are 
proposing to remove § 170.315(g)(7) 
through (9). We welcome feedback on 
these proposals. 
3. Real World Testing 
Section 3001(c)(5) of the PHSA (42 
U.S.C. 300jj–11) (section 4002 of the 
Cures Act) requires, as a Condition and 
Maintenance of Certification under the 
Certification Program, that health IT 
developers have successfully tested the 
real world use of the technology for 
interoperability in the type of setting in 
which such technology would be 
marketed. Section 4003(a)(2) of the 
Cures Act defines interoperability as 
health information technology that 
enables the secure exchange of 
electronic health information with, and 
use of electronic health information 
from, other health information 
technology without special effort on the 
part of the user; allows for complete 
access, exchange, and use of all 
electronically accessible health 
information for authorized use under 
applicable state or federal law; and does 
not constitute information blocking as 
defined in section 3022(a) of the Cures 
Act. This definition for interoperability 
was codified in 45 CFR 170.102. 
In the Cures Act Final Rule, through 
the Real World Testing Condition and 
Maintenance of Certification 
requirements, we finalized the 
implementation of the statute’s real 
world testing requirements in 45 CFR 
170.405 for health IT certified to the 
following certification criteria: 
€The ‘‘care coordination’’ certification criteria in § 170.315(b); 
€The ‘‘clinical quality measures’’ certification criteria in § 170.315(c)(1) 
through (c)(3); 
€The ‘‘view, download, and transmit to 3rd party’’ certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(e)(1); 
€The ‘‘public health’’ certification criteria in § 170.315(f); 
€The certification criteria related to APIs in § 170.315(g)(7) through (g)(10); 
and 
€The ‘‘transport methods and other protocols’’ certification criteria in 
§ 170.315(h). 
However, in that same final rule we 
replaced the ‘‘application access—data 
category request’’ certification criterion 
(§ 170.315(g)(8)) with the ‘‘standardized 
API for patient and population services’’ 
certification criterion (§ 170.315(g)(10)). 
The ‘‘application access—data category 
request’’ certification criterion was only 
available for certification until 
December 31, 2022, and we eventually 
removed the certification criterion from 
the CFR (89 FR 101776). In the HTI–4 
Final Rule, we finalized six new 
certification criteria. We clarified that 
because § 170.405(a) cross references 
§ 170.315(b), the new § 170.315(b)(4) 
‘‘real-time prescription benefit’’ 
certification criterion finalized in HTI– 
4 would be automatically included 
within real world testing requirements. 
Similarly, we included five API-focused 
certification criteria: § 170.315(g)(31) 
‘‘provider prior authorization API— 
coverage requirements discovery’’; 
§ 170.315(g)(32) ‘‘provider prior 
authorization API—documentation 
templates and rules’’; § 170.315(g)(33) 
‘‘provider prior authorization API— 
prior authorization support’’; 
§ 170.315(j)(20) ‘‘workflow triggers for 
decision support interventions— 
clients’’; and § 170.315(j)(21) 
‘‘subscriptions—client’’ in scope for real 
world testing. Health IT certified to the 
identified real world testing certification 
criteria are eligible for the SVAP under 
§ 170.405(b)(8) and (9). 
Consistent with the ‘‘Real World 
Testing Condition and Maintenance of 
Certification Requirements Enforcement 
Discretion Notice’’
61
we issued on June 
30, 2025, we now propose the following 
deregulatory actions: (1) removing the 
requirement to submit real world testing 
plans for all real world testing 
certification criteria (§ 170.405(b)(1)); (2) 
limiting full real world testing results 
reporting (§ 170.405(b)(2)) to only 
Health IT Modules that are certified to 
the API certification criteria identified 
below; and (3) permitting the use of 
SVAP for the remaining non-API real 
world testing certification criteria with 
minimal reporting requirements. 
We note that certain certification 
criteria would be fully removed from 
real world testing requirements by 
virtue of their proposed removal from 
the Certification Program. We have 
included such an outcome in our 
proposed revised Real World Testing 
Condition of Certification (45 CFR 
170.405(a)). If, in a subsequent final 
rule, we determine to keep any of the 
criteria proposed for removal and they 
are currently identified in the Real 
World Testing Condition of Certification 
(45 CFR 170.405(a)), they would also 
remain part of the Real World Testing 
Condition of Certification. Examples of 
such criteria would be the public health 
criteria proposed for removal 
(‘‘transmission to cancer registries’’ 
(§ 170.315(f)(4)) and ‘‘transmission to 
public health agencies—health care 
surveys’’ (§ 170.315(f)(7)). 
First, we propose to remove the real 
world testing plan submission 
requirement from the Real World 
Testing Maintenance of Certification 
requirements (§ 170.405(b)). Second, we 
propose to revise the results reporting 
requirements under § 170.405(b)(2) to 
make clear what health IT developers 
must include in their real world testing 
results reporting. Specifically, 
developers will be expected to report on 
all health IT certified to any of the 
certification criteria in § 170.315(g) 
certification criteria as of January 1 of 
the year in which they must complete 
real world testing. Developers must also

report on all health IT certified to any 
of the certification criteria in 
§ 170.315(g) that undergo updates via 
Inherited Certified Status during the real 
world testing year. This is consistent 
with current requirements to conduct a 
full calendar year of real world testing 
(§ 170.405(b)(2)(ii)). 
We propose to limit real world testing 
reporting (§ 170.405(b)(2)) to API- 
focused certification criteria which are, 
at this time: ‘‘standardized API for 
patient and population services’’ 
(§ 170.315(g)(10)); ‘‘provider prior 
authorization API—coverage 
requirements discovery’’ 
(§ 170.315(g)(31)); ‘‘provider prior 
authorization API—documentation 
templates and rules’’ (§ 170.315(g)(32)); 
and ‘‘provider prior authorization API— 
prior authorization support’’ 
(§ 170.315(g)(33)). This approach aligns 
with our overall move to focus the 
Certification Program on APIs (see 
discussion in section I.A.2) with a 
particular focus on FHIR-based APIs. 
SVAP will remain available for all 
certified health IT subject to the Real 
World Testing Condition of Certification 
and Maintenance of Certification 
requirements. For the API-focused 
certification criteria identified above, 
the real world testing SVAP reporting 
requirements will not change. However, 
for health IT certified to the remaining 
real world testing certification criteria 
identified in § 170.405(a), developers 
will only need to identify in their real 
world testing results their voluntary 
updates (health IT products, 
certification criteria, and standards/ 
implementation specifications) to 
standards and implementation 
specifications that the National 
Coordinator has approved through 
SVAP, which is consistent with current 
requirements under 45 CFR 
170.405(b)(2)(ii)(C). This approach will 
allow developers to continue to 
voluntarily update to newer versions of 
standards once approved by the 
National Coordinator, which supports 
advancing interoperability. For clarity, 
we have captured this SVAP 
requirement separately in proposed 45 
CFR 170.405(b)(2)(iv). We also propose 
a revision to § 170.405(b)(8) to cross- 
reference paragraph (a) of § 170.405 
instead of paragraph (b) due to our 
proposed revisions. 
4. Attestations 
Section 4002(a) of the Cures Act 
requires that a health IT developer, as a 
Condition and Maintenance of 
Certification requirement under the 
Certification Program, provide to the 
Secretary an attestation to the 
Conditions of Certification required in 
section 3001(c)(5)(D) of the PHSA. In 
the Cures Act Final Rule, we adopted 
regulation text implementing the Cures 
Act’s ‘‘Attestations’’ Condition of 
Certification requirement in § 170.406 
(85 FR 25781). Under § 170.406, health 
IT developers attest twice a year to 
compliance with the Conditions and 
Maintenance of Certification 
requirements. A health IT developer of 
certified health IT must provide the 
Secretary an attestation of compliance 
with § 170.404, the API Conditions and 
Maintenance of Certification 
requirements, according to 
§ 170.406(a)(4). Because we discuss the 
proposal to remove § 170.315(g)(7) 
through (9) in section III.A.7 of this 
proposed rule, we also propose to 
remove the reference to § 170.315(g)(7) 
through (9) in § 170.406(a)(4). In 
§ 170.406(a)(5), we also propose to 
remove the reference to § 170.315(g)(7) 
through (9). Additionally, we propose to 
remove the reference to § 170.315(h) in 
§ 170.406(a)(5) because, as we discussed 
in section III.A.8, we propose to remove 
§ 170.315(h)(1) and (2), in effect 
removing the entirety of § 170.315(h). 
5. Insights 
The Cures Act specified requirements 
in section 4002(c) to establish an EHR 
Reporting Program to provide 
transparent reporting on certified health 
IT in the categories of interoperability, 
usability and user-centered design, 
security, conformance to certification 
testing, and other categories, as 
appropriate to measure the performance 
of EHR technology. In the HTI–1 Final 
Rule (89 FR 1311), we established the 
EHR Reporting Program as the ‘‘Insights 
Condition and Maintenance of 
Certification’’ (also referred to as the 
‘‘Insights Condition’’) and finalized in 
§ 170.407 the first set of measures to 
reflect the interoperability category 
required by section 3009A(a)(3)(A)(iii) 
of the PHSA. The Insights Condition 
includes seven measures on which 
health IT developers under the 
Certification Program must annually 
report consistent with specified 
timelines. We refer readers to the HTI– 
1 Proposed Rule (88 FR 23831) for 
detailed background on how we 
engaged with the health IT community 
for the purpose of identifying measures 
that developers of certified health IT 
would be required to report on as a 
Condition and Maintenance of 
Certification under the Certification 
Program. 
Consistent with E.O. 14192, 
‘‘Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation,’’
62
we identified certain 
regulatory requirements for which the 
exercise of enforcement discretion may 
prevent or mitigate the accrual of sunk 
costs by regulated entities. On April 29, 
2025, we published the ‘‘Insights 
Condition and Maintenance of 
Certification Enforcement Discretion 
Notice,’’
63
in which we stated we had 
exercised the following enforcement 
discretion: 
€ASTP/ONC will not exercise its direct review authority under 45 CFR 
170.580 for any non-conformity, 
potential or actual, that arises solely 
from a health IT developer not 
complying with 45 CFR 170.407(b) 
except for reporting requirements 
related to the ‘‘use of FHIR in apps 
through certified health IT’’ measure (45 
CFR 170.407(a)(3)(iv)). Stated another 
way, ASTP/ONC only expects that 
health IT developers will report on the 
‘‘use of FHIR in apps through certified 
health IT’’ measure 
(§ 170.407(a)(3)(iv)(A) and (B) beginning 
in July of 2027 and (a)(3)(iv)(C) 
beginning in July 2028). 
€ASTP/ONC will not conclude that an ONC–ACB has failed to adhere to 45 
CFR 170.523(u), find a violation of 45 
CFR 170.560(a), or take any enforcement 
action under 45 CFR 170.565 against an 
ONC–ACB if an ONC–ACB confirms 
that the only measure under 45 CFR 
170.407(b) for which a health IT 
developer submits responses is the ‘‘use 
of FHIR in apps through certified health 
IT’’ measure (45 CFR 170.407(a)(3)(iv)). 
We stated that this enforcement 
discretion will be in effect beginning on 
July 1, 2027, and will remain in effect 
until HHS completes a deregulatory 
action to remove or revise 45 CFR 
170.407 and 170.523(u). Therefore, in 
this proposed rule, we propose to 
remove the following measures in 
§ 170.407(a)(3): 
€§ 170.407(a)(3)(i), Individuals’ access to electronic health information 
through certified health IT; 
€§ 170.407(a)(3)(ii), Consolidated clinical document architecture (C–CDA) 
problems, medications, and allergies 
reconciliation and incorporation 
through certified health IT; 
€§ 170.407(a)(3)(iii), Applications supported through certified health IT; 
€§ 170.407(a)(3)(v), Use of FHIR bulk data access through certified health IT; 
€§ 170.407(a)(3)(vi), Immunization administrations electronically submitted

page/2025-05/insights_measure_spec_sheet_4_fact_sheet_v03.2_508.pdf. to immunization information systems 
through certified health IT; and 
€§ 170.407(a)(3)(vii), Immunization history and forecasts through certified 
health IT. 
Note, given this proposal, we propose 
to make conforming edits to the list 
structure in § 170.407(a)(3) to revise the 
‘‘use of FHIR in apps through certified 
health IT’’ as paragraph (i) instead of 
(iv). In addition, we propose to remove 
corresponding references to the 
removed measures in § 170.407(b) as we 
only expect that health IT developers 
would report on the ‘‘use of FHIR in 
apps through certified health IT’’ 
measure in the newly designated 
§ 170.407(a)(3)(i), specifically, 
paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A) and (B) beginning 
July of 2027 and (a)(3)(i)(C) beginning in 
July 2028. We believe our proposal to 
remove the measures listed above 
reduces cost and burden to the public. 
Our proposals ensure that the Insights 
Condition is aligned with other 
proposed policies and changes to the 
Certification Program that prioritize 
exchange using FHIR-based APIs. 
Among the measures that related to 
FHIR-based APIs, the ‘‘use of FHIR in 
apps through certified health IT’’ 
provides the most valuable insights 
related to implementation and use of 
FHIR. We welcome comments on these 
proposals. 
In the HTI–1 Final Rule (89 FR 1346), 
we finalized the Insights Condition 
reporting frequency to annually for any 
Health IT Module that has or has had an 
active certification to § 170.407(b)(1) 
during the prior six months. We propose 
to revise § 170.407(b)(1) to clarify that a 
developer must provide an annual 
response to the Insights Condition of 
Certification if they had at least one 
actively certified Health IT Module as of 
January 1 of the reporting period (i.e., 
start of the data collection year) and 
remain certified under the Certification 
Program at the time of submission (i.e., 
July of the following year). We 
understand that Health IT Modules can 
be certified and withdrawn in cycles; 
however, this proposal would make 
clear that we expect health IT 
developers of certified health IT to be 
accountable for any data collected 
during the calendar-year (CY) data 
collection period, which begins January 
1, regardless of how many months the 
certification remained active. For 
example, a developer of certified health 
IT that has a Health IT Module certified 
to § 170.315(g)(10) for only the first 
three months of CY 2026 would report 
data reflecting use during this three- 
month period even though their Health 
IT Module was withdrawn or otherwise 
no longer certified for the remaining 
nine months of CY 2026. 
This also applies to newer versions of 
certified health IT leveraging inherited 
certified status (ICS). We expect that 
developers of certified health IT 
requesting ICS for newer versions would 
include data for all applicable certified 
health IT, including newer versions in 
scope of the Insights Condition 
requirements as of January 1, at the start 
of the data collection reporting period. 
We note that developers of certified 
health IT would not be expected to 
separate their certified health IT, in 
scope of ICS, by versions when 
submitting their response. This has 
always been the expectation from what 
we finalized in the HTI–1 Final Rule (89 
FR 1348). 
We propose to revise the name of 
§ 170.407 (Insights Condition and 
Maintenance of Certification) to simply 
‘‘Insights.’’ This proposed change is 
intended to ensure consistency and 
uniformity across all the Conditions and 
Maintenance of Certification in subpart 
D of 45 CFR part 170. We welcome 
comments on our proposals. 
Technical Updates in Measure 
Specification Sheets 
In the HTI–1 Final Rule (89 FR 1313), 
we stated that while the substantive 
requirements for each measure are 
defined in rulemaking, we determined 
that measure specification sheets are a 
logical and accessible method for the 
public to also view the technical 
specification that supports those 
requirements, and that this is consistent 
with the approach used by other HHS 
programs related to measure 
specifications (e.g., CMS Electronic Clinical Quality Measures (CMS 
eCQMs)). Additionally, the measure 
specification sheets provide granular 
definitions and other information 
needed to operationalize the metrics to 
ensure they are implemented in a 
consistent manner across health IT 
developers. 
We also stated that we intend to 
provide up to date measure 
specification sheets to assist with the 
regulated community’s understanding of 
the finalized measures and metric 
calculations (89 FR 1313). In January 
2025, we provided developers of 
certified health IT updated measure 
specification sheets for certain measures 
finalized in the HTI–1 Final Rule, with 
the flexibility to implement either 
version 2 or version 4 of the measure 
specification sheets for the first year of 
reporting.
64
We note that this flexibility 
is only for the first year of reporting 
(until July 2027) and that we expect 
developers to comply with the most up 
to date version of the measure 
specification sheets provided at 
www.healthIT.gov in subsequent years. E. ONC Health IT Certification Program 
Administrative Requirements 
1. Principles of Proper Conduct for 
ONC–ACBs 
Under the ‘‘principles of proper 
conduct (PoPCs) for ONC–ACBs’’ in 
§ 170.523, we require ONC–ACBs to 
provide ASTP/ONC a ‘‘certified product 
listing’’ in § 170.523(f) which is a 
current list of Health IT Modules that 
have been certified. We propose to 
revise § 170.523(f)(1)(viii) to no longer 
require ONC–ACBs to provide test data 
versions used and whether any test data 
was altered for the certification criterion 
or criteria to which the Health IT 
Module has been certified. With this 
proposed revision, we would still 
require the test procedure and test tool 
version used. Through our CHPL, we 
have tracked user access to the test data 
versions used and have found 
engagement to be very infrequent. In 
addition, an analysis of Health IT 
Modules in the CHPL indicates that the 
majority of developers do not employ 
custom data when conducting 
certification testing but instead utilize 
the ASTP/ONC-provided test data. Due 
to low user engagement and little 
variance from the use of ASTP/ONC- 
provided test data, we believe 
documenting the test data provides little 
value to the public and represents 
additional administrative burden for 
both health IT developers and ONC– 
ACBs. We believe this proposed 
revision to remove this requirement 
aligns with our goals to reduce burden 
for both health IT developers and ONC– 
ACBs. 
We propose to make conforming 
revisions to the PoPCs for ONC–ACBs in 
§ 170.523 by removing cross-references 
to certain certification criteria that we 
propose to remove in this proposed rule. 
Specifically, we propose to remove and 
reserve § 170.523(f)(1)(ix) through (xi) 
which reference the ‘‘privacy and 
security’’ certification criteria 
(§ 170.315(d)), the ‘‘quality management 
system’’ certification criterion 
(§ 170.315(g)(4)), and the ‘‘accessibility- 
centered design’’ certification criterion 
(§ 170.315(g)(5)). We also propose to 
remove and reserve § 170.523(f)(1)(xix), 
which references the ‘‘safety enhanced

Robotic process automation is software 
technology in which software ‘‘bots’’ mimic human 
actions to accomplish computer-based activities, 
automating otherwise-manual tasks or processes 
that are structured, repetitive, and follow a set of 
established rules. Illustrative types of tasks include, 
without limitation, data retrieval, data entry, and 
transaction processing (e.g., customer returns of products, appointment scheduling). See, e.g., 
Moore, Sara, 2018, ‘‘The bots are coming: robotic 
process automation saves DLA time, money’’ 
(https://www.dla.mil/About-DLA/News/News- 
Article-View/Article/1704350/the-bots-are-coming- 
robotic-process-automation-saves-dla-time- 
money/). 
66
Autonomous artificial intelligence systems that 
are designed to execute complex tasks 
autonomously or with little human involvement to 
accomplish pre-determined goals is often referred to 
a ‘‘agentic AI’’ because these systems’ capabilities 
involve them acting independently or having ability 
or means (‘‘agency’’) to act independently 
(analogous to a human ‘‘having agency’’ or power 
to do something) or function as an agent of its user. 
See, e.g., Merriam-Webster ‘‘agentic’’ (https://
www.merriam-webster.com/slang/agentic
#::text=What%20does%20agentic%20mean?,
(%E2%80%9Chaving%20agency%22)). See also, e.g., Acharya, et al, 2025, ‘‘Agentic AI: Autonomous Intelligence for Complex Goals—A Comprehensive 
Survey,’’ IEEEAccess, Digital Object Identifier Continued 
design’’ certification criterion 
(§ 170.315(g)(3)). We also propose to 
remove and reserve § 170.523(f)(1)(xxi) 
because this section includes a reference 
to § 170.315(b)(11)(vi) related to 
intervention risk management practices 
and we propose to remove 
§ 170.315(b)(11)(vi) earlier in this 
proposed rule. 
Consistent with the proposals related 
to the Real World Testing Condition and 
Maintenance of Certification in 
§ 170.405, we propose to remove the 
ONC–ACB review and confirmation 
process for real world testing plans in 
§ 170.523(p)(1) and the reference to 
submit real world testing plans in 
§ 170.523(p)(3). We welcome comments 
on our proposals. 
2. Health IT Module Certification 
We propose to revise the ‘‘Health IT 
Module dependent criteria’’ in 
§ 170.550(g) by removing § 170.550(g)(1) 
through (4) to conform with our 
proposals to remove certain certification 
criteria related to privacy and security, 
and design and performance. We also 
propose to renumber the remaining 
paragraphs in § 170.550(g)(5) and (g)(6) 
to (g)(1) and (g)(2), respectively. We 
propose to remove § 170.550(h) ‘‘privacy 
and security certification framework’’ 
and § 170.550(j) ‘‘direct project transport 
method’’ to also conform with our 
proposals to remove certification criteria 
in § 170.315(d) and § 170.315(h). 
Lastly, we propose to revise 
§ 170.550(e) ‘‘standards updates’’ to 
correct a cross-reference from 
‘‘§ 171.405(b)(7) or (8)’’ to 
‘‘§ 170.405(b)(7) or (8).’’ In the Cures Act 
Final Rule, we adopted § 170.550(e) 
‘‘standards updates’’ requiring ONC– 
ACBs to provide an option for 
certification of Health IT Modules 
consistent with SVAP to one or more of 
the certification criteria referenced in 
real world testing requirements in 
§ 170.405(a) based on newer versions of 
standards (85 FR 25952). However, in 
the regulatory text we erroneously 
amended § 170.550(e) to require ONC– 
ACBs provide an option for certification 
of Health IT Modules consistent with 
§ 171.405(b)(7) or (8). We intended, as 
indicated by the preamble, to adopt the 
reference to the real world testing 
requirements in 45 CFR part 170 instead 
of 45 CFR part 171 Information 
Blocking. Therefore, we propose to 
revise § 170.550(e) to reference the 
SVAP requirements in § 170.405(b)(7) 
and (8). We welcome comments on our 
proposals. 
3. Certification to Newer Versions of 
Certain Standards 
We propose to revise the 
‘‘certification to newer versions of 
certain standards’’ in § 170.555 by 
removing references to the term 
‘‘Complete EHR’’ as it is no longer 
relevant in our Certification Program. 
Retaining the references may cause 
confusion for the public because the 
ability to maintain ‘‘Complete EHR’’ 
certification was only permitted with 
health IT certified to the 2014 Edition 
certification criteria, and the ‘‘Complete 
EHR’’ concept was discontinued for the 
2015 Edition (80 FR 62719). The Cures 
Act Final Rule removed the 2014 
Edition certification criteria in § 170.314 
and references to ‘‘Complete EHR’’, and 
in the HTI–1 Final Rule, we removed 
the ‘‘Complete EHR’’ language from all 
reference points in §§ 170.523 and 
170.524 (89 FR 1209 through 1210). We 
continued to remove the remaining 
references to ‘‘Complete EHR’’ in the 
HTI–2 TEFCA Final Rule (89 FR 
101775) within subpart E of 45 CFR part 
170, and we finalized our proposal to 
remove the term ‘‘Complete EHR’’ 
including in § 170.555(b)(2). However, 
we inadvertently excluded amendatory 
instructions to revise § 170.555(b)(2) in 
the final rule. Therefore, we propose to 
revise § 170.555(b)(2) to remove the 
reference to ‘‘Complete EHR.’’ We 
welcome comments on our proposal. 
4. Effect of Revocation on the 
Certifications Issued to Health IT 
Module(s) 
We propose to revise the title of 
§ 170.570 from ‘‘Effect of revocation on 
the certifications issued to Complete 
EHRs and EHR Module(s)’’ to ‘‘Effect of 
revocation on the certifications issued to 
Health IT Module(s).’’ As discussed 
above, the term ‘‘Complete EHRs’’ is no 
longer a relevant term in our 
Certification Program and retaining it 
may cause confusion for the public. 
Therefore, we propose to revise the title 
of § 170.570 to further align with our 
removals of the outdated ‘‘Complete 
EHR’’ terminology. We welcome 
comments on our proposal. 
IV. Information Blocking (Part 171) 
Comments received in response to the 
CMS–ASTP/ONC Request for 
Information; Health Technology 
Ecosystem (90 FR 21034) (CMS–ASTP/ 
ONC RFI) and other RFIs, such as the 
Federal Trade Commission’s Request for 
Public Comment Regarding Reducing 
Anti-Competitive Regulatory Barriers 
(FTC–2025–0028), expressed concerns 
about several exceptions to the 
information blocking rule as well as 
general concerns about the exceptions. 
Innovators and patient advocates 
indicated that some of the exceptions as 
currently codified may be too broad or 
are being misused in an anti- 
competitive or obstructive way. For 
example, some commenters suggested 
narrowing or eliminating the exceptions 
for infeasibility, security, and fees. This 
proposed rule aims to address several 
prominent themes among the concerns 
raised by commenters through proposals 
below. Each of these proposed revisions 
to the information blocking regulations 
would be effective, if finalized, on the 
effective date of a subsequent final rule. 
We are also considering further actions 
such as future rulemaking, guidance, 
and educational outreach in response to 
other RFI comments and feedback from 
stakeholders. 
A. ‘‘Access’’ and ‘‘Use’’ Definitions In the Cures Act Final Rule, we 
finalized definitions of ‘‘access,’’ 
‘‘exchange,’’ and ‘‘use’’ (85 FR 25805). 
We explained that the concepts of 
access, exchange, and use are closely 
related, and noted that EHI cannot be 
used unless it can be accessed, and that 
this often requires that EHI be 
exchanged among different individuals 
or entities and through various 
technological means (85 FR 25805). Our 
references to various technological 
means always included access via 
automated means, such as robotic 
process automation (commonly referred 
to as the use of ‘‘bots’’)
65
and 
autonomous artificial intelligence 
systems (‘‘agentic artificial intelligence’’ 
or ‘‘agentic AI’’),
66
but it has come to

We believe ‘‘artificial intelligence’’ is 
commonly and generally understood to mean a 
machine-based system that can, for a given set of 
human-defined objectives, make predictions, 
recommendations, or decisions influencing real or 
virtual environments as well as the capability of a 
computer, computer system, or set of algorithms to 
imitate intelligent human behavior. See, e.g., 
National Institute of Standards and Technology 
Computer Security Research Center glossary entries

Moore, Sara, 2018, ‘‘The bots are coming: 
robotic process automation saves DLA time, 
money’’ (https://www.dla.mil/About-DLA/News/ 
News-Article-View/Article/1704350/the-bots-are- 
coming-robotic-process-automation-saves-dla-time- 
money/). 
our attention through RFI comments, 
our own market observations, and 
stakeholder interactions that both actors 
and those who seek to access, exchange, 
or use EHI would appreciate explicit 
clarity regarding automated means of 
access, exchange, or use of EHI, 
particularly with such means as robotic 
process automation (commonly 
referenced as ‘‘RPA’’ or ‘‘bots’’) and 
autonomous artificial intelligence 
systems (commonly referenced in the 
field as ‘‘agentic AI’’).
67
Therefore, we 
propose to add language to the ‘‘access’’ 
and ‘‘use’’ definitions at 45 CFR 
171.102. We propose to explicitly codify 
that access means the ability or means 
necessary to make EHI available for 
exchange or use, including by 
automation technologies such as robotic 
process automation and autonomous 
artificial intelligence systems. Similarly, 
we propose to explicitly codify that 
‘‘use’’ means the ability for EHI, once 
accessed or exchanged through 
whatever technological means, to be 
understood and acted upon, including, 
without limitation, by automation 
technologies such as autonomous 
artificial intelligence systems and 
robotic process automation. 
In addition to the discussion in the 
Cures Act Final Rule regarding 
individuals or entities accessing, 
exchanging, and using EHI (85 FR 
25805), we also discussed the concept of 
automated access in the HTI–1 Final 
Rule. Specifically, we noted that some 
entities may provide data services and 
that such actions are considered access, 
exchange, or use regardless of the route 
used to request, access, or receive data 
(89 FR 1363). The heterogeneity in how 
individuals and entities may access, 
exchange, or use EHI as well as the 
potential for significantly increased use 
of automated means to improve 
efficiency
68
further contributes to a 
conclusion that actors and those who 
interact with them would benefit from 
explicit regulatory text specifying that 
the access, exchange, and use 
definitions are not limited to manual 
processes but apply equally to access, 
exchange and use of EHI that occurs via 
automated means including, without 
limitation, autonomous artificial 
intelligence systems and that an actor 
interfering with such access, exchange, 
or use may implicate the information 
blocking definition. 
We are also considering to similarly 
revise the ‘‘exchange’’ definition in 
§ 171.102. We propose to revise the 
‘‘exchange’’ definition in addition to the 
proposed revisions to the ‘‘access’’ and 
‘‘use’’ definitions, as an alternative 
proposal to only revising the ‘‘access’’ 
and ‘‘use’’ definitions. Under this 
alternative proposal, we propose that 
the meaning of ‘‘exchange’’ includes, 
without limitation, the ability for EHI to 
be transmitted, through use of 
automation technologies (e.g., robotic process automation, autonomous 
artificial intelligence systems) or 
otherwise, between and among different 
technologies, systems, platforms, or 
networks. We seek comments on these 
proposals, including perspectives on 
whether actors and those who interact 
with actors would find these explicit 
regulatory updates helpful. 
We remind readers that, as we have 
explained in prior rules, the information 
blocking regulations are designed to 
operate in a manner consistent with the 
framework of the HIPAA Privacy Rule 
and other laws providing privacy rights 
for patients (85 FR 25812). Any actor (as 
defined in 45 CFR 171.102) that is also 
subject to any provision(s) in 45 CFR 
parts 160, 162, or 164 must continue to 
comply with such provision(s) when 
and to the extent such provisions of the 
HIPAA Rules are applicable to the 
actor’s conduct (89 FR 1380), such as 
with providing access, exchange, or use 
of protected EHI. 
B. Infeasibility Exception Revisions 
We propose and seek comments on 
revisions to two separate conditions of 
the Infeasibility Exception (45 CFR 
171.204). Specifically, we propose to 
remove the ‘‘third party seeking 
modification use’’ condition 
(§ 171.204(a)(3)) and to revise or remove 
the ‘‘manner exception exhausted’’ 
condition (§ 171.204(a)(4)). 
1. Third Party Seeking Modification Use 
Condition 
In the HTI–1 Final Rule, we finalized 
the ‘‘third party seeking modification 
use’’ condition of the Infeasibility 
Exception (§ 171.204(a)(3)). We 
explained that when this condition 
applies and the overall exception is met, 
an actor’s practice of not fulfilling a 
request for use of EHI in order to modify 
EHI, including but not limited to 
creation and deletion functionality, will 
not be considered information blocking 
(89 FR 1200 and 89 FR 1376 through 
1380). As finalized by the HTI–1 Final 
Rule and currently codified, 
§ 171.204(a)(3) applies to a request to 
enable use of EHI in order to modify 
EHI, provided that the request for such 
use is not from a health care provider 
that is a HIPAA covered entity (as 
defined in 45 CFR 160.103) requesting 
such use from an actor that is its 
business associate (as defined in 45 CFR 
160.103). Thus, the condition is not 
available when a health care provider 
that is also a HIPAA covered entity 
requests (directly, or through another 
business associate of the health care 
provider) such use of EHI from an actor 
who is the health care provider’s 
business associate (88 FR 23866, 89 FR 
1380). 
HTI–1 Proposed Rule commenters 
expressed concern that certain actors, 
such as health IT developers of certified 
health IT, may seek to misuse the 
proposal to restrict access to EHI in an 
overly broad manner (89 FR 1377). Of 
these commenters, some expressed 
concern that the proposal could 
potentially inhibit care coordination by 
making it too easy for an actor holding 
EHI to simply refuse modification use 
requests from third parties who also 
furnish services to the same patient(s) 
(89 FR 1377). 
Commenters on the HTI–1 Proposed 
Rule stated that the limitation to this 
condition is not broad enough, and that 
ASTP/ONC should expand the 
limitation of this condition to also apply 
when the actor’s customers are not 
HIPAA covered entities; or are not 
health care providers, but are 
maintaining EHI in systems licensed by 
an actor (89 FR 1379). For reasons stated 
in response to these comments in the 
HTI–1 Final Rule (89 FR 1379), we did 
not expand the finalized exclusion from 
applicability of the condition but noted 
that we may consider amending the 
condition in the future (89 FR 1379). 
In the HTI–2 Proposed Rule, we 
proposed two revisions to narrow the 
application and use of the third party 
seeking modification use condition. 
First, we proposed to narrow the

See 89 FR 1380 discussion of flexibility for actors to structure communications and operating 
procedures as well as our statement that, for 
purposes of § 171.204(a)(3), an actor may choose to 
verify that the modification use request came from 
the health care provider themselves or accept the 
third party’s representation of a request as coming 
from a health care provider of which the actor is 
a business associate. 
applicability of the condition by 
changing the words ‘‘health care 
provider’’ to ‘‘covered entity as defined 
in 45 CFR 160.103’’ (89 FR 63625), 
which would expand the circumstances 
in which the condition could not be used. We noted that this proposed 
expansion of the exclusion would 
encompass requests from all covered 
entities to their business associates (89 
FR 63625). Second, we also proposed to 
exclude from applicability of the 
condition requests from any health care 
provider (as defined in § 171.102) who 
is not a HIPAA covered entity (as 
defined in 45 CFR 160.103) but who is 
requesting modification use from an 
actor whose activities would make the 
actor a business associate of that same 
health care provider if that health care 
provider were a HIPAA covered entity (89 FR 63625). This was to align with 
the definition of ‘‘actor’’ under the 
information blocking regulations. 
Although comments on the HTI–2 
Proposed Rule’s potential revisions to 
the Infeasibility Exception, including 
but not limited to the third party seeking 
modification use condition, were 
generally supportive, some commenters 
once again raised concerns about the 
potential for actors to misuse the 
Infeasibility Exception and 
recommended that we implement 
measures to mitigate misuse. For 
example, one commenter suggested 
requiring an independent review and 
appeals process for actors’ claims of 
infeasibility as well as the mandated 
public reporting of all infeasibility 
claims to hold actors accountable. 
We received a relatively small number 
of comments specific to the proposed 
narrowing of the third party seeking 
modification use condition 
(§ 171.204(a)(3)). These comments 
indicate a much more mixed response to 
this specific proposal than to the 
Infeasibility Exception. Several 
commenters supported the proposed 
narrowing of the third party seeking 
modification use condition’s 
application. Several commenters 
discussed the proposal as an expansion 
rather than a contraction of the 
condition’s application, indicating a 
misunderstanding of the proposal. 
Several other commenters requested 
additional clarification to understand 
the revised condition or even to fully 
comment on the proposal. For example, 
one commenter stated that the proposal 
was vague, and asked ASTP/ONC to 
clarify the proposal’s intended function 
and scope. Another commenter asked 
for examples of specific types of 
scenarios so that they could fully 
understand the proposal. Several other 
commenters, both supportive of the 
proposal’s intent and critical of it for 
various reasons, suggested actors would 
need extensive guidance to properly 
implement the third party seeking 
modification use condition. 
We have evaluated not only our 
previously proposed revisions to the 
condition but also the third party 
seeking modification use condition 
(§ 171.204(a)(3)) in light of: the 
comments we received in response to 
the proposal in the HTI–2 Proposed 
Rule; our observation of the health 
information ecosystem and health IT 
market as they stand today; the intent of 
the information blocking regulations, 
including what are reasonable and 
necessary practices for not sharing EHI; 
and current HHS policy priorities. We 
now believe the condition as a whole is 
unnecessary and that removing it will 
better support the access, exchange, and 
use of EHI and the goals we set out in 
the Cures Act Final Rule to unleash 
innovation and competition for the 
improvement of health outcomes and 
lower health care costs for all 
Americans. 
In the HTI–1 Proposed Rule, we 
solicited comment on whether the 
(then-proposed) third party seeking modification use condition should be of 
limited duration (88 FR 23867). We 
specifically requested comment on 
whether ASTP/ONC should consider 
proposing, in the future, that the 
condition be eliminated if, at some 
point, health IT is capable of supporting 
third-party modification use of EHI by 
any party with a legal right to do so (or no legal prohibition against it), with no 
or minimal infeasibility or other 
concerns (88 FR 23867). While the 
majority of comments on this subject 
stated either that the proposal should 
not have a sunset date, or that it would 
be premature to establish a sunset date 
at that time, two commenters stated that 
the condition should or could be 
eliminated in the future if technology is 
capable of supporting the 
aforementioned modification use of EHI, 
with no or minimal infeasibility or other 
concerns (89 FR 1378). 
We agreed in the HTI–1 Final Rule 
with those commenters who had 
indicated that it would be premature to 
establish at that time a sunset date for 
§ 171.204(a)(3) because the 
appropriateness of eliminating it 
depended on the continued 
development of health IT’s capability to 
support lawful third-party modification 
use of EHI by any party and with no or 
minimal infeasibility or other concerns 
(89 FR 1378). However, we also said 
that if advances in health IT capabilities 
or other changes in the interoperability 
and information sharing environment 
indicated to us that the condition 
should be modified or sunset, we would 
anticipate proposing such a change in a 
future rulemaking (89 FR 1378). 
We have observed substantial growth 
in technical approaches that enable 
efficient, appropriately secure 
modification use as well as two-way 
exchange interactions between different 
developers’ systems to support 
modification use of EHI since HHS 
announced the HTI–1 Final Rule in 
December, 2023.
69
These approaches 
appear to be rapidly maturing. As we 
increasingly observe modern, innovative 
approaches efficiently achieving two- 
way interoperability, we no longer 
believe it is reasonable or necessary for 
an actor to dismiss as ‘‘infeasible’’ a 
request for such use from any requestor without engaging in information 
gathering or analysis to work through 
the available alternative manners. Thus, 
we now believe the time is ripe to 
propose to retire the third party seeking 
modification use condition. Removing 
the condition in its entirety is also the 
most efficient option to resolve concerns 
we have developed from public 
comments, market observations, and 
stakeholder interactions. As noted 
previously, we are concerned that some 
actors may be misapplying the 
condition or intentionally abusing 
customers’ and third parties’ 
misunderstandings of the condition or, 
in the case of business associates, the 
flexibility we provided for them to 
confirm whether a third-party 
modification use request is actually 
from their HIPAA-regulated health care 
provider customer.
70
In particular, we 
are concerned that this condition is 
being abused by EHR developers to limit 
third parties, including other actual or 
potential business associates of the EHR 
developer’s health care provider 
customer, from accessing or using a 
health care provider’s EHR and relevant

EHI. This concern is extremely acute for 
us in that the ability for health care 
providers to use other innovative health 
IT to access and use the EHR has been 
a fundamental goal for Congress and 
HHS since we first proposed the 
information blocking regulations. 
We are aware that actors may have 
concerns about third-party 
modifications relating to the 
confidentiality, integrity, or availability 
of EHI, or to the potential risks to 
patient safety arising from corrupt or 
misidentified patient data. We remind 
health care providers, other actors, 
patients, and others who may have such 
concerns that we have established 
exceptions designed for those types of 
concerns. For example, an actor may 
choose to satisfy the Security Exception 
(§ 171.203) where an actor has identified 
a specific threat that a request for 
access, exchange, or use poses to the 
confidentiality, integrity, or availability 
of EHI in an actor’s systems. Similarly, 
an actor may choose to satisfy the 
Preventing Harm Exception (§ 171.201) 
if the actor knows or reasonably 
suspects specific data a third party seeks 
to write into the EHI the actor maintains 
to be misidentified or mismatched, 
corrupt due to technical failure, or 
erroneous for another reason. Actors 
may choose to satisfy other exceptions, 
where applicable, regardless of whether 
we finalize retirement of the third party 
seeking modification use condition of 
the Infeasibility Exception. We refer 
readers to subparts B, C, and D of 45 
CFR part 171 for the full conditions of 
each established information blocking 
exception as currently codified. 
However, we remind readers that for 
reasons discussed in Section IV.A.2 of 
this proposed rule, we propose to revise 
or remove the manner exception 
exhausted condition from the Infeasibility Exception (§ 171.204) and 
for reasons discussed in Section IV.D of 
this proposed rule, we propose to 
remove subpart D of 45 CFR 171: 
Exceptions That Involve Practices 
Related to Actors’ Participation in The 
Trusted Exchange Framework and 
Common Agreement (TEFCA
SM.
). 
We also remind actors that, if we were 
to finalize this proposal to remove the 
third party seeking modification use 
condition, other conditions of the 
Infeasibility Exception, including the 
infeasible under the circumstances 
condition would continue to be 
available to actors. For example, the 
infeasible under the circumstances 
condition may apply to scenarios where 
enabling a third party to ‘‘write’’ data to 
an EHR system would be unduly 
burdensome on a health IT developer of 
certified health IT and its health care 
provider customers. As always, for any 
practice to be considered information 
blocking, it must be examined on a case- 
by-case basis in order to assess the 
specific facts and circumstances and 
determine whether the practice meets 
the information blocking definition (see 
§ 171.103, see also IB.FAQ46.1.2022FEB).
71
 
We note again, as we did in the HTI– 
1 Final Rule, that the third party seeking 
modification use condition does not 
imply or indicate any change to the 
HIPAA Rules (89 FR 1380). Any actor 
that is subject to any provision(s) in 45 
CFR parts 160, 162, or 164 must 
continue to comply with such 
provision(s) when and to the extent 
such provisions of the HIPAA Rules are 
applicable to the actor’s conduct (89 FR 
1380). 
To preserve accuracy of references in 
existing information blocking 
educational materials to specific 
conditions of the Infeasibility Exception 
by CFR citation, we propose to remove 
and reserve subparagraph (3) within 
§ 171.204(a). We are not proposing at 
this time to redesignate any of the other 
conditions currently codified within 
§ 171.204(a), nor are we proposing to 
make any other changes to any of these 
conditions or the responding to requests 
condition in § 171.204(b). We welcome 
comments on our proposal to remove 
the third party seeking modification use condition of the Infeasibility Exception. 
2. Manner Exception Exhausted 
Condition 
In the HTI–1 Proposed Rule, we 
proposed to re-number the ‘‘infeasible 
under the circumstances’’ condition of 
the Infeasibility Exception (45 CFR 
171.204) and to codify at (a)(4) a new 
manner exception exhausted condition. 
We stated the proposed manner 
exception exhausted condition would 
apply where an actor is unable to fulfill 
a request for access, exchange, or use of 
EHI despite having exhausted the 
Manner Exception in § 171.301 by 
offering all alternative manners in 
accordance with § 171.301(b), so long as 
the actor does not currently provide to 
a substantial number of individuals or 
entities similarly situated to the 
requestor the same requested access, 
exchange, or use of the requested EHI 
(88 FR 23867). We noted that actors 
expressed concern about circumstances 
where the actor’s inability to satisfy the 
Manner Exception’s conditions rests 
solely on the requestor refusing to 
accept access, exchange, or use in any 
manner consistent with § 171.301 and 
that fulfilling the request in the manner 
requested would require substantial 
technical or financial resources, or both, 
in the view of the actor, including 
significant opportunity costs (88 FR 
23868). We noted that actors may have 
been experiencing a problematic level of 
uncertainty about whether they will be 
engaging in information blocking if they 
decline demands from requestors for 
non-standard, non-scalable solutions 
that they do not currently support. We 
noted that an actor might have 
experienced such uncertainty even after 
that actor had offered to provide access, 
exchange, or use of EHI in the same 
manner(s) the actor makes the EHI 
generally available to its customers or 
affiliates, and through other standards- based manners, consistent with 
§ 171.301—including offering terms for 
such manners that are consistent with 
the Fees (§ 171.302) and Licensing 
(§ 171.303) Exceptions (88 FR 23868). 
We indicated observing such 
uncertainty among actors with 
substantial skills and other resources to 
develop new, unique or unusual 
manners of supporting access, exchange, 
or use of EHI (88 FR 23868). 
We explained that the proposed 
manner exception exhausted condition 
would provide actors the option of 
satisfying the Infeasibility Exception 
without needing to assess whether they 
could theoretically or technically meet the requestor’s particularized demands 
regarding the manner and/or the terms 
in which to achieve access, exchange, or 
use of requested EHI. We proposed that 
an actor could satisfy the Infeasibility 
Exception when the actor met the 
requirements of the § 171.204(b) 
responding to requests condition and 
the three factors of manner exception 
exhausted condition were true: (i) The actor could not reach 
agreement with a requestor in 
accordance with § 171.301(a) manner 
requested condition (as we have proposed it in this proposed rule) or 
was technically unable to fulfill a 
request for electronic health information 
in the manner requested; 
(ii) The actor offered all alternative 
manners ‘‘in accordance with’’ 
§ 171.301(b) alternative manner condition (as we have proposed it in 
this proposed rule) for the electronic 
health information requested but could 
not reach agreement with the requestor; 
and 
(iii) The actor does not provide the 
same access, exchange, or use of the 
requested electronic health information 
to a substantial number of individuals 
or entities that are similarly situated to 
the requester (88 FR 23869).

Here we are referring to § 171.301(b)(2) as it

published; re-designation of paragraphs within

in the HTI–1 Final Rule (89 FR 1437, see also 89 FR 1372). 
73
https://healthit.gov/feedback. 
We requested comments on all 
aspects of the proposal. In particular, in 
regards to the second factor, we asked 
whether an actor should have to offer 
access, exchange, or use in manners that 
would satisfy all three of the alternative 
manners in § 171.301(b)(1)
72
or if it 
should be sufficient for an actor to offer 
to fulfill the request in two manners that 
use content and transport standards 
published by the Federal Government or 
a standards-developing organization 
accredited by the American National 
Standards Institute; or by offering 
fulfillment in at least one such manner 
and an alternative machine-readable format consistent with 
§ 171.301(b)(1)(iii) (88 FR 23869). 
Regarding the third factor, we asked 
whether the language provided adequate 
assurance that actors would not be able 
to misuse the § 171.204(a)(4) manner 
exception exhausted condition to avoid 
supplying some particular requestor(s) 
with manner(s) of access, exchange, or 
use of the requested EHI that would be 
more accurately characterized as 
generally available than as new, unique, 
or unusual (88 FR 23870). In particular, 
we noted that the third factor is 
intended to ensure the condition cannot 
be satisfied where a manner 
(mechanisms, interoperability elements) 
is currently supported for a substantial 
number of individuals or entities but the 
responding actor wants to deny that 
mechanism to particular requestor(s) for 
inappropriate reasons, such as to 
discriminate against competitors, 
potential competitors, or those the 
responding actor may be concerned 
could use the resultant access, 
exchange, or use of EHI to furnish, 
develop, or facilitate development of 
products or services that could compete 
with those of the actor (88 FR 23870). 
We asked if the flexibility of the 
‘‘substantial number’’ factor would 
better recognize variations in actors’ 
operational contexts, including their 
organization sizes, as compared to the 
clarity provided by a simple fixed 
threshold of ‘‘more than one,’’ or even 
just one other entity. We also sought 
comment on whether we should include 
‘‘similarly situated’’ requestors or if 
such a phrase risked allowing actors to 
discriminate based on requestor size or 
type (88 FR 23870). 
In the HTI–1 Final Rule, we finalized 
the manner exception exhausted condition of the Infeasibility Exception 
(§ 171.204(a)(4)). In finalizing the 
manner exception exhausted condition, 
we explained that when an actor either 
technically cannot provide the access, 
exchange, or use of EHI in the manner 
requested, or the actor and requestor 
cannot reach agreeable terms on the 
manner requested, the actor must 
attempt to fulfill the request using the 
alternative manners in § 171.301(b) in 
order to exhaust the Manner Exception 
(89 FR 1381). Under the Manner 
Exception, for any alternative manner, 
the requestor must either specify the 
manner they would accept 
(§ 171.301(b)(1)(i) and (ii)) or 
specifically agree with the machine- 
readable format that they would accept 
(§ 171.301(b)(1)(iii)). We stated that in 
situations where an actor offers at least 
two alternative manners and the 
requestor does not specify or agree to 
receive the EHI via the offered 
alternative manners (as may be the case 
if the requestor does not want to receive 
the EHI in such a manner or cannot 
receive the EHI in such a manner), an 
actor may seek to satisfy the manner 
exception exhausted condition of the 
Infeasibility Exception (89 FR 1381). In 
other words, under the manner 
exception exhausted condition, it would 
not matter whether the requestor 
specified the alternative manner, which 
is a requirement to meet the Manner 
Exception under § 171.301(b)(1)(i) and 
(ii). And the manner exception 
exhausted condition of the Infeasibility Exception could be met if the requestor 
did not agree with the actor upon an 
offered alternative machine-readable 
format, which is a requirement to meet 
the Manner Exception under 
§ 171.301(b)(1)(iii). 
The manner exception exhausted condition of the Infeasibility Exception, 
as finalized in the HTI–1 Final Rule, 
considers three factors. First, it requires 
that the actor could not reach agreement 
with a requestor in accordance with 
§ 171.301(a) or was technically unable 
to fulfill a request for EHI in the manner 
requested (§ 171.204(a)(4)(i), 89 FR 1384 
through 85). Second, the condition 
requires that the actor offered at least 
two alternative manners in accordance 
with § 171.301(b) (whether or not the 
requestor identified the alternative 
manner and/or agreed to it), one of 
which must use either technology 
certified to standard(s) adopted in part 
170 (§ 171.301(b)(1)(i)) or published 
content and transport standards 
consistent with § 171.301(b)(1)(ii) (see 
§ 171.204(a)(4)(ii)). The third factor 
requires that the actor does not provide 
the same access, exchange, or use of the 
requested EHI to a substantial number of 
individuals or entities that are similarly 
situated to the requester 
(§ 171.204(a)(4)(iii), 89 FR 1385 through 
86). We explained what ‘‘provide’’ 
means in this context (89 FR 1385 
through 86), as well as ‘‘substantial 
number’’ (89 FR 1384 through 85) and 
‘‘similarly situated’’ (89 FR 1386). 
Specifically, we noted that ‘‘similarly 
situated’’ would serve to indicate that 
different specific individuals or entities 
within a class of such individuals or 
entities who are similarly situated to 
one another should be treated in a 
consistent and non-discriminatory 
manner, and that it is not our intent for 
the ‘‘individuals or entities that are 
similarly situated to the requester’’ 
criterion of the condition to be used in 
a way that differentiates the same access 
to EHI simply based on the requestor’s 
status, such as an individual (e.g., a patient) or entity (e.g., a healthcare system) (89 FR 1386). We explained 
that, in determining whether a requestor 
is similarly situated, an actor shall not 
discriminate based on certain factors, 
including whether the requestor is an 
individual as defined in § 171.202(a)(2), 
the health care provider type and size, 
and whether the requestor is a 
competitor of the actor or whether 
providing such access, exchange, or use, 
would facilitate competition with the 
actor (89 FR 1386). We finalized these 
factors in § 171.204(a)(4)(iv). 
The manner exception exhausted condition of the Infeasibility Exception 
was intended to provide clarity and 
flexibility for actors. We did not intend 
for it to cover any unreasonable or 
unnecessary practice that would allow 
an actor to avoid providing the access, 
exchange, or use of EHI in a manner 
already supported by that actor. 
Based on comments received in 
response to the CMS–ASTP/ONC RFI, 
questions received through the ASTP/ 
ONC Health IT Feedback and Inquiry 
Portal,
73
and other stakeholder 
feedback, we are concerned that actors 
may be abusing the exception in various 
ways, including claiming to requestors 
that the manner exception exhausted 
condition applies when the actor has 
not, in fact, explored whether they 
could reach agreeable terms to fulfill a request in the manner requested, or has 
not attempted to fulfill the request in at 
least two other manners consistent with 
the § 171.301(b) alternative manner, or 
both. Additionally, we are concerned 
that certain terms and criteria of the 
condition (i.e., ‘‘same,’’ ‘‘substantial number’’ and ‘‘similarly situated’’) are 
being misused to deny requestors access 
to existing APIs and other manners of access, exchange, and use that have

Where applicable law prohibits an actor from 
fulfilling a requestor’s requested access, exchange, 
or use of requested EHI, the actor need not satisfy 
an exception to have certainty that complying with 
the law to which they are subject will not be 
considered ‘‘information blocking.’’ Where 
applicable law, such as the HIPAA Privacy Rule, 
permits use or disclosure (access, exchange, or use) 
of the requested EHI only when certain requirements (‘‘preconditions’’) are met, the 
Precondition Not Satisfied (45 CFR 171.202(b)) sub- 
exception of the Privacy Exception outlines a 
framework for actors to follow so that the actors’ 
practices of not fulfilling requests to access, 
exchange, or use EHI would not constitute 
information blocking when a precondition of 
applicable law has not been satisfied. 
75
‘‘Interoperability element’’ is defined in 
§ 171.102. Additional information about this 
definition is available in the preamble of the Cures 
Act Final Rule at 85 FR 25806 through 25808.

Please see section IV.A of this preamble, above, 
for descriptions of robotic process automation and 
agentic AI. 
been granted to other parties. To address 
these concerns, we now propose to 
modify the condition to eliminate the 
potential for misuse and abuse. 
Specifically, we propose (in 
§ 171.204(a)(4)(ii)) to increase the 
minimum number of alternative 
manners required to be considered to 
have ‘‘exhausted’’ the Manner Exception 
from two to ‘‘all,’’ in line with the 
original (HTI–1 Proposed Rule) proposal 
for the condition. In referring to ‘‘all 
alternative manners,’’ we do not mean 
all possible manners of exchange other 
than the manner requested. Rather, we 
specifically mean those manners that 
are set forth in subparagraph (i), (ii), or 
(iii) of § 171.301(b)(1). We seek 
comment on whether, and to what 
extent, actors and those who request 
EHI access, exchange, or use from actors 
would find useful a further reiteration 
in the text of the condition that each 
alternative manner must be attempted 
consistent with § 171.301(b) (the 
alternative manner condition of the 
Manner Exception) in order to satisfy 
the manner exception exhausted condition of the Infeasibility Exception 
(§ 171.204(a)(4)). This addition would 
further reiterate what the regulation text 
says at present and what has been stated 
in the preamble of the HTI–1 Final Rule 
(see, e.g., 89 FR 1383). Further, we 
remind actors that a manner that meets 
any sub-paragraph within 
§ 171.301(b)(1) must be consistent with 
the entirety of § 171.302(b), which 
includes § 171.301(b)(2), under which 
any fees that would be charged by the 
actor in relation to fulfilling the request 
must satisfy the Fees Exception 
(§ 171.302), and § 171.301(b)(3), under 
which any license of interoperability 
elements granted by the actor in relation 
to fulfilling the request satisfy the 
Licensing Exception (§ 171.303). 
We also welcome comment on 
whether revisions to the wording of 
§ 171.204(a)(4)(ii) would help ensure an 
actor can only claim to a requestor that 
fulfilling the request is ‘‘infeasible’’ 
under the manner exception exhausted 
condition when the actor has exhausted 
the Manner Exception, as we intend. We 
welcome comment on whether any such 
revisions could also discourage actors 
from attempting to abuse the condition. 
We also propose to incorporate language 
into the regulation text consistent with 
the preamble of the HTI–1 Final Rule, 
as discussed above, to emphasize a 
distinction between the Manner 
Exception (§ 171.301) and the manner 
exception exhausted condition 
(§ 171.204(a)(4)): satisfying the manner 
exception exhausted condition does not 
require that the requestor identify the 
alternative manner or agree to it, which 
is required for actors to be able to fully 
meet the Manner Exception. 
In § 171.204(a)(4)(iii), we propose 
three revisions. First, we proposed to 
replace ‘‘same’’ with ‘‘analogous’’ as it 
refers to the access, exchange, or use of 
EHI. We discussed in the HTI–1 Final 
Rule how ‘‘same’’ meant the same 
requested access, exchange, or use, 
including the ‘‘same’’ manners of EHI 
access, exchange, or use, as provided to 
others. We still intend to include the 
concept of ‘‘the same’’ access, exchange, 
or use of EHI in consideration of 
whether the provision is met, but we 
believe the more expansive term 
‘‘analogous’’ is more appropriate. We 
believe using ‘‘analogous’’ access, 
exchange, or use in comparison to what 
the actor provides to other individual(s) 
or entity(ies) is a basis less subject to 
manipulation than ‘‘same,’’ which some 
actors may argue equates to ‘‘identical’’ 
access, exchange, or use of EHI. We do 
not intend for ‘‘same’’ to be interpreted 
in a way that could be limiting and 
potentially manipulated to deny access, 
exchange, or use. For example, this 
condition would not be available to an 
actor when a requestor requests API 
access with certain features, such as 
‘‘write’’ capabilities or filtering 
functionality, that the actor provides to 
other entities. Assuming for the sake of 
this example that the actor is not 
prohibited by applicable law from 
providing the requested access, 
exchange, or use of the requested EHI to 
the requestor,
74
the request is not 
infeasible under any other condition in 
§ 171.204 (e.g., § 171.204(a)(1) uncontrollable events) and that no other 
exception in subpart B of part 171 (e.g., 
the Privacy Exception) applies to the 
particular facts and circumstances, we 
would expect such access would be 
provided to the requestor without 
unnecessary delay. In providing such 
access, exchange, or use, an actor who 
seeks certainty that their practices in 
fulfilling the requested access, 
exchange, or use of EHI via the API with 
certain features will not be considered 
information blocking can align their 
practices with other relevant 
exception(s), such as the Fees Exception 
and, as necessary, the Licensing 
Exception.
75
 
Similarly, the manner exception 
exhausted condition (as § 171.204(a)(4) is currently codified or as we propose in 
this proposed rule to modify it) would 
not be available to an actor if the actor 
makes an API available to entities or 
individuals and a requestor attempts to 
access the API through automated 
means (such as robotic process 
automation and agentic AI).
76
In such 
cases, the access achieved by automated 
means would be the same and 
analogous to an entity or individual 
accessing the API using more manual 
means. Accordingly, we believe 
replacing ‘‘the same’’ with ‘‘analogous’’ 
is a better basis for comparing the 
request with what the actor provides to 
other individuals or entities, including 
those who may use different automated 
means, or may use manual means. We 
believe this revision aligns more with 
the intent of the statutory information 
blocking definition (PHSA section 
3022(a)(1)), which focuses on practices 
‘‘likely to interfere with, prevent, or 
materially discourage access, exchange, 
or use of electronic health information’’ 
without any specification of, or 
limitation to, access, exchange, or use of 
EHI through particular mechanisms, 
technologies, or workflows. 
Second and third, we propose: 
changing the ‘‘substantial number’’ 
element to ‘‘any,’’ by which we mean at 
least one individual or entity; and 
removing consideration of whether such 
individual or entity is similarly situated 
to the requestor. The proposed revisions 
to § 171.204(a)(4)(iii) would explicitly 
exclude from application of the 
condition any situation where the actor 
offers at least one individual or entity 
the requested access, exchange, or use. 
These revisions would alleviate 
concerns that the terms ‘‘substantial’’ 
and ‘‘similarly situated’’ are being 
manipulated to deny access, exchange, 
or use. Further, we do not believe that 
removal of the terms would undermine 
the stated overall objective of the 
condition when it was proposed, which 
was to provide certainty to actors when 
they were faced with situations where 
the request would involve building ‘‘one 
off’’ access, exchange, or use interfaces. 
Rather, the condition could still be met 
if the actor does not provide analogous

In the Cures Act Final Rule preamble 
discussion of alternative manners using content and 
transport standards specified by the requestor under 
what is now codified at § 171.301(b)(1)(ii), such an 
alternative ‘‘manner’’ includes two distinct 
components: (1) content standard; and (2) transport 
standard (85 FR 25878). 
79
Manners of access, exchange, and use would 
include, without limitation and where applicable, 
modification use of EHI that may be maintained by the actor (for example, where an actor maintains 
Continued 
access, exchange, or use of the requested 
EHI to any other individual or entity. 
If we finalize the proposal to retain 
the § 171.204(a)(4) condition with 
removal of the ‘‘similarly situated’’ 
element from § 171.204(a)(4)(iii), instead 
of our alternative proposal (below) to 
remove § 171.204(a)(4) in its entirety, 
we also propose to remove 
§ 171.204(a)(4)(iv). Specifying bases an 
actor shall not use in determining 
whether a requestor is ‘‘similarly 
situated’’ under § 171.204(a)(4)(iii) 
would be moot upon removal of 
‘‘substantially similar’’ from 
§ 171.204(a)(4)(iii). 
In the alternative to our proposed 
revisions to the condition above, we 
propose to remove the § 171.204(a)(4) 
manner exception exhausted condition 
entirely if public comments we receive 
on this proposed rule indicate that our 
proposed revisions would not be 
sufficient to eliminate or substantially 
mitigate the misuse or abuse of the 
condition. We seek comments on this 
alternative approach. 
If we were to finalize the alternative 
proposal to remove the § 171.204(a)(4) 
manner exception exhausted condition, 
we would reserve subparagraph (4) 
within § 171.204(a) to preserve accuracy 
of references in existing information 
blocking education materials to specific 
conditions of the Infeasibility Exception 
by CFR citation. We are not proposing 
at this time to redesignate any of the 
conditions currently codified within 
§ 171.204(a) that would remain in the 
event we finalize the alternative 
proposal to remove subparagraph (4), 
the proposal discussed in section IV.A.1 
of this preamble to remove 
subparagraph (3) of § 171.204(a), or 
both. 
C. Manner Exception 
In the Cures Act Final Rule, we 
established the Manner Exception (then 
referred to as the ‘‘Content and Manner’’ 
Exception) in § 171.301 (85 FR 25959, 
see also 85 FR 25875 through 25879). In 
finalizing the exception, we stated our 
belief that it addressed comments 
received regarding the breadth of the 
EHI definition and flexibility in the 
manner an actor fulfills a request to 
access, exchange, or use EHI, while 
providing market participants the ability 
to reach and maintain market negotiated 
terms (85 FR 25876). As finalized in the 
Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25642) and 
the Cures Act Interim Final Rule (85 FR 
70085), the information blocking 
definition (§ 171.103) and the Content 
and Manner Exception (§ 171.301) were 
limited for a period of time to a subset 
of EHI that was narrower than the EHI 
definition finalized in the Cures Act 
Final Rule in § 171.102. The narrower 
subset included only the EHI identified 
by the data elements represented in 
USCDI version 1 for the first 18 months 
(until May 2, 2022) after the 
applicability date for 45 CFR part 171 
(November 2, 2020) (85 FR 25792). The 
Cures Act Interim Final Rule extended 
the applicability date of 45 CFR part 171 
to April 5, 2021 (85 FR 70069). This 
extension moved the end of the first 18 
months of applicability of 45 CFR part 
171 to October 5, 2022 (85 FR 70069). 
In the HTI–1 Final Rule (effective 
April 8, 2024), we revised § 171.301 to 
remove reference to the content 
condition, which had been moot as of 
October 6, 2022 (89 FR 1372). We also 
accordingly renumbered the remaining 
provisions in § 171.301 and simplified 
the name to the ‘‘Manner’’ Exception (89 
FR 1372). 
Based on comments received in 
response to the CMS–ASTP/ONC RFI, 
questions received through the ASTP/ 
ONC Health IT Feedback and Inquiry 
Portal,
77
and other stakeholder 
feedback, we are concerned that some 
actors may be attempting to abuse the 
exception, and that all participants in 
the health information ecosystem would 
benefit from greater certainty that the 
manner requested condition does not 
apply to any contracts, agreements, or 
licenses that are for the purposes of 
accomplishing access, exchange, or use 
of EHI in the manner requested, but 
that: (1) are not at ‘‘market’’ rate (85 FR 
25877); (2) are contracts of adhesion; or 
(3) contain unconscionable terms (as 
defined below). Specifically, we are 
concerned that some actors may be 
incorrectly citing the manner requested 
condition to persuade requestors that 
the exception applies to agreements and 
terms to which it has never applied. 
In both the Cures Act Proposed Rule 
and the Cures Act Final Rule, we 
recognized the inherent power inequity 
between EHR developers and various 
types of requestors (see 84 FR 7520, noting that EHR developers are in a 
unique position to block access to EHI 
for use in competing systems or 
applications). We also specifically 
address this concept of inequity and 
how it could impact terms of contracts 
in the Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 
25812). Foremost, we stated that a 
contract may implicate the information 
blocking provision if it included 
unconscionable terms for the access, 
exchange, or use of EHI or licensing of 
an interoperability element, which 
could include, but not be limited to, 
requiring a software company that 
produced a patient access application to 
relinquish all IP rights to the actor or 
agreeing to indemnify the actor for acts 
beyond standard practice, such as gross 
negligence on the part of the actor. 
Further, we noted that such terms may 
be problematic with regard to 
information blocking in situations 
involving unequal bargaining power 
related to accessing, exchanging, and 
using EHI (85 FR 25812). 
As currently codified, the Manner 
Exception’s manner requested condition (§ 171.301(a)) applies when an actor 
fulfills a request for EHI in any manner 
requested that the actor is technically 
able to fulfill and for which the actor is 
able to reach agreeable terms with the 
requestor. As set forth in the Cures Act 
Final Rule, if the actor fulfills a request 
to access, exchange, or use EHI in any 
manner requested, the fees or licensing 
agreements associated with fulfilling 
such requests will not be limited by the 
conditions in the Fees Exception 
(§ 171.302) or Licensing Exception 
(§ 171.303). Our rationale was that 
actors would first attempt to negotiate 
agreements in any manner requested 
with terms the actor chooses at the 
‘‘market’’ rate—which supports 
innovation and competition (85 FR 
25877). If the actor could not reach 
agreeable terms by negotiation at the 
market rate, actors could still fulfill the 
request in an alternative manner (85 FR 
25877). Given the language in the Cures 
Act Final Rule, we understood 
‘‘agreeable terms’’ were those terms 
agreed upon by actors through arms- 
length negotiation at market rate (85 FR 
25877). Agreeable terms did not 
incorporate contracts of adhesion or 
contracts with unconscionable terms. 
These types of agreements, by their very 
nature, are either not agreed upon 
through arm’s length negotiation or at 
market rate. 
Further, the manner requested 
condition allows the negotiation of 
market rates and terms for the manner 
of access, exchange, or use only—that is, 
the requested combination of content 
and transport standard(s),
78
ability to 
use an API or portal, or any other 
requested health IT functionality or 
technological mechanism that otherwise 
achieves the requested access, exchange, 
or use of the requested EHI.

80
Any individual or entity can be a requestor, 
including without limitation an individual or entity 
that happens to meet the § 171.102 ‘‘actor’’ 
definition. For example, a health care provider is 
often also a requestor seeking access, exchange, or 
use of EHI from health IT developers of certified 
health IT, HIN/HIEs, and other health care 
providers. 
Manner Exception does not apply to an 
actor’s practices in negotiating any 
aspect of a contract with a requestor 
other than the manner in which access, 
exchange, or use of requested EHI is 
achieved and, if the request is fulfilled in the manner requested, to market fees 
for items and services provided and 
market terms for any licensing of 
interoperability elements needed to 
fulfill the requested access, exchange, 
and use of EHI in that manner. 
We reiterate the plain language of the 
Manner Exception, and particularly the 
manner requested condition, in that the 
Manner Exception only covers the 
technical manner of exchange of the 
requested EHI, and not any other term(s) 
in any contract or agreement entered or 
reached between the actor and 
requestor. Further, such contracts or 
agreements for access, exchange, and 
use of EHI cannot be contracts of 
adhesion or contracts containing 
unconscionable terms. These types of 
contracts are not covered by the Manner 
Exception even if these agreements were 
styled as, or in fact were, achieving 
access, exchange, or use of the requested 
EHI in the requested manner. These 
types of contracts would also likely 
constitute an interference (85 FR 25813) 
under the information blocking 
regulations. 
To further explicate the applicability 
of the Manner Exception where the 
actor has the technical capability and is 
able to reach agreement with the 
requestor to fulfill access, exchange, or 
use of requested EHI in a manner 
requested by the requestor, we offer two 
proposals. First, we propose to revise 
§ 171.301(a)(2) to add a new 
subparagraph (iii) to incorporate in 
regulation text and explicitly state that 
any contract or agreement related to the 
access, exchange, or use of EHI: (1) must 
be at market rate; (2) must not be a 
contract of adhesion; and (3) must not 
contain unconscionable terms. As stated 
in the Cures Act Final Rule, agreements 
must be negotiated at market rate (85 FR 
25877). We propose to define, in 
§ 171.102, ‘‘market rate’’ using 
paragraph (1) of the definition of ‘‘fair 
market value’’ found in the Stark Law 
regulations at 42 CFR 411.351: ‘‘(1) 
General. The value in an arm’s-length transaction, consistent with the general 
market value of the subject transaction’’ 
(42 CFR 411.351). We propose to define, 
in § 171.102, ‘‘contract of adhesion’’ as 
a contract provided on a standardized 
form, or on a ‘‘take it or leave it basis’’ 
without a realistic opportunity to 
bargain where the desired product, 
services, access, use, or exchange cannot 
be provided except by acquiescing to 
the form contract. We propose to 
incorporate the Merriam Webster 
dictionary’s definition of 
‘‘unconscionable’’ to define, in 
§ 171.102, ‘‘unconscionable terms’’ as 
those terms that are excessive, 
unreasonable, or shockingly unfair or 
unjust. We further explain 
unconscionable terms by way of 
examples in this preamble as well as by 
the examples found in the preamble to 
the Cures Act Final Rule (85 FR 25811 
through 25812). Examples of 
unconscionable terms related to the 
access, exchange, or use of EHI would 
include indemnification waivers, 
waivers of rights to file claims of 
wrongdoing with state or Federal 
authorities, terms that specify 
unreasonable revenue sharing beyond 
fair market value (as already prohibited 
by the Fees Exception), or terms that 
require surrendering intellectual 
property rights without fair 
compensation. 
An actor’s practice that meets the 
manner requested condition of the 
Manner Exception does not currently, 
and would not under the first proposed 
revision, have to also satisfy the Fees 
Exception (§ 171.302) or the Licensing 
Exception (§ 171.303) in order for the 
actor to have certainty the actor’s 
practice specific to charging a fee or 
licensing interoperability elements for 
fulfilling the requested EHI access, 
exchange, or use in the manner 
requested would not be considered information blocking. 
This proposed approach offers both 
benefits and some potential challenges. 
We believe this proposal to define new 
terms and emphasize the parameters of 
the condition would offer more 
certainty to responding actors and to 
requestors
80
about what types, terms, or 
provisions of agreements could be 
covered by the Manner Exception under 
the manner requested condition (§ 171.301(a)). However, we also 
recognize that actors would not have the 
same degree of certainty that any fees 
and licensing terms the actor may seek 
to institute are covered by an exception 
under the proposed revision of 
§ 171.301(a) as they would have under 
the Fees Exception and the Licensing 
Exception. Similarly, a requestor would 
not have the clarity and certainty 
provided by the Fees Exception’s 
(§ 171.302) specifications for the fees it 
covers, including its exclusion of certain 
bases for fees (e.g., § 171.302(b)(3) and (4)), or the requirements in the 
Licensing Exception (§ 171.303) for an 
actor’s practices in licensing 
interoperability elements in relation to 
fulfilling access, exchange, or use of 
requested EHI in the manner requested. 
Therefore, we offer another proposal 
discussed in more detail below. As to 
this proposal, we seek comments on the 
proposed provision and proposed 
definitions, suggestions for alternative 
definitions, and any missing 
components that would more explicitly 
describe excluded contractual terms. 
For example, should we instead, or in 
addition, include the definition of 
‘‘general market value’’ at 42 CFR 
411.351—‘‘with respect to the purchase 
of an asset, the price that an asset would 
bring on the date of acquisition of the 
asset as the result of bona fide 
bargaining between a well-informed 
buyer and seller that are not otherwise 
in a position to generate business for 
each other.’’? 
We recognize the first proposed 
approach of adding explicit language to 
§ 171.301(a) to ensure fair market rates 
and exclude certain types of contracts 
and contractual terms may not fully 
address all concerns about the misuse of 
the Manner Exception and may add 
complexity or ambiguity with new 
terms. Therefore, we also propose in the 
alternative to remove paragraph (a)(2) 
from the manner requested condition of 
the Manner Exception, and explicitly 
apply the conditions of both the Fees 
Exception (§ 171.302) and the Licensing 
Exception (§ 171.303) to any agreement 
an actor makes with a requestor related 
to fulfilling the request for access, 
exchange, or use of EHI in any manner 
requested. Paragraph (a)(2) is where the 
manner requested condition currently 
states that if an actor fulfills a request 
for EHI in any manner requested, any 
fees charged by the actor in relation to 
fulfilling the request are not required to 
satisfy the Fees Exception 
(subparagraph (i) of paragraph (a)(2)), 
and any license of interoperability 
elements granted by the actor in relation 
to fulfilling the request are not required 
to satisfy the Licensing Exception 
(subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a)(2)). 
Under this alternative proposal, we 
propose that the agreement would need 
to satisfy the Fees Exception and the 
Licensing Exception, even when 
fulfilling the request in any manner 
requested. This approach would mean

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS261013 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 245 / Monday, December 29, 2025 / Proposed Rules that, while the actor and requestor 
retain flexibility to reach mutually 
agreeable terms for the actor to fulfill 
access, exchange, or use of the requested 
EHI in the manner requested, any fees 
charged by the actor and any licensing 
terms for interoperability elements from 
the actor to the requestor related to 
fulfilling the request must meet all of 
the requirements of the Fees Exception 
and the Licensing Exception for the 
actor to have certainty that their practice 
of charging fees or licensing 
interoperability elements would not 
constitute information blocking. In 
addition to simplifying the Manner 
Exception, this alternative proposal to 
revise the Manner Exception could 
promote greater consistency in actors’ 
practices specific to fees and licensing 
terms for fulfilling EHI access, 
exchange, and use requests by following 
specified provisions of regulatory 
exceptions. 
Removing paragraph (2) from 
§ 171.301(a) and applying the Fees and 
Licensing Exceptions also specifically 
addresses the concerns related to 
indemnification terms in contracts, as 
well as revenue-sharing agreements. 
Under this alternative proposal, the 
actor and requestor would retain the 
flexibility to negotiate and execute 
specific details related to the requested 
manner of access, exchange, or use of 
the requested EHI. This proposal also 
ensures there is no mistaken belief that 
the Manner Exception would apply to 
any other practice of the actor related to 
fulfilling the request, including any 
contract or agreement on fees, licensing 
terms, or any matter other than the 
specific technical details of what EHI is 
requested, and how the request to 
access, exchange, or use the requested 
EHI will be fulfilled. As noted above, we 
have heard that actors may be abusing 
the manner requested conditions to convince requestors to accept 
disagreeable terms that would be 
considered an interference and likely 
information blocking. Removing 
paragraph (2) from § 171.301(a) and 
applying the Fees Exception and 
Licensing Exception would address 
these issues. 
We welcome comments on our 
proposed revisions to the Manner 
Exception, including each of our 
proposals. 
D. Removal of Subpart D Exception and 
Other Provisions Specific to TEFCA 
In the HTI–1 Final Rule, we finalized 
a new TEFCA Manner Exception in 45 
CFR 171.403, explaining that an actor’s 
practice of limiting the manner in which 
it fulfills a request for access, exchange, 
or use of EHI to providing such access, 
exchange, or use only via TEFCA would 
not be considered information blocking 
when the practice follows certain 
conditions (89 FR 1387). The conditions 
include that the actor and requestor are 
both part of TEFCA, that the requestor 
is capable of such access, exchange, or 
use of the requested EHI from the actor 
via TEFCA, that the request is not made 
via the standards adopted in 45 CFR 
170.215 or version approved pursuant to 
45 CFR 170.405(b)(8), and that any fees 
charged by the actor and the terms for 
any license of interoperability elements 
granted by the actor in relation to 
fulfilling the request satisfy, 
respectively, the Fees Exception (45 
CFR 171.302) and the Licensing 
Exception (§ 171.303) (89 FR 1388). 
In the HTI–2 Proposed Rule, we 
requested further comment on the 
TEFCA Manner Exception. We noted 
that the finalized exception differed in 
two ways from the proposal in the HTI– 
1 Proposed Rule: by applying the Fees 
Exception and the Licensing Exception 
to the TEFCA Manner Exception, and by 
including the limitation that carves out 
requests made for access, exchange, or 
use of EHI via FHIR API standards (89 
FR 63643). We also solicited comment 
on the ‘‘FHIR’’ carve out, specifically for 
options for revising or sunsetting the 
condition (89 FR 63643). Having 
considered comments received, we 
finalized the exception without changes 
in the HTI–2 Final Rule (89 FR 101778 
through 80). We also proposed in the 
HTI–2 Proposed Rule (89 FR 63642) and 
finalized in the HTI–2 Final Rule (89 FR 
101777 through 78) the addition of a 
definitions section (§ 171.401) to 
Subpart D of part 171: ‘‘Exceptions That 
Involve Practices Related to Actors’ 
Participation in The Trusted Exchange 
Framework and Common Agreement 
(TEFCA
TM
)’’. 
We now propose to remove the 
TEFCA Manner Exception (§ 171.403) 
from 45 CFR part 171. Based on 
TEFCA’s continued implementation and 
maturation and public comments 
received, including those received in 
response to the CMS–ASTP/ONC 
Request for Information; Health 
Technology Ecosystem (90 FR 21034) 
(CMS–ASTP/ONC RFI), the removal of 
the TEFCA Manner Exception 
(§ 171.403) is appropriate for multiple 
reasons. 
The exception was intended to 
incentivize participation in TEFCA. 
However, many of the Qualified Health 
Information Networks (QHINs)—who 
already participate in TEFCA—were 
critical of the exception when it was 
proposed and presumably did not find 
the exception to be an incentive. 
Further, we have observed that there is 
significant private sector investment 
being made toward TEFCA participation 
in the health information ecosystem. In 
comments on the CMS–ASTP RFI, 
stakeholders representing health care 
providers, technology innovators, and 
other perspectives, in addition to 
QHINs, advocated for continued use and 
advancement of TEFCA. We therefore 
believe that it is unnecessary to sustain 
the TEFCA Manner Exception to 
incentivize participation in TEFCA. 
We also believe the TEFCA Exception 
may be negatively impacting 
participants in the health information 
ecosystem due to some entities’ 
potential misunderstanding regarding 
its purpose and applicability. For 
example, although we stated when we 
finalized the exception that an actor 
responding to a request from an 
individual (e.g., a patient or the patient’s personal representative) would 
not be able to make use of this 
exception, we have observed some 
ongoing misunderstanding of this 
exception as shielding actors who are 
part of TEFCA from information 
blocking penalties for practices that 
interfere with individual-access use 
cases. 
The exception is also now 
unnecessary because it describes 
activities that are, given the robust 
TEFCA participation we are seeing, still 
covered by the Manner Exception 
(§ 171.301) or Infeasibility Exception 
(§ 171.204). The Manner Exception 
encourages active negotiation between a 
requestor and actor toward getting 
requestors the EHI access, exchange, 
and use they seek in a manner to which 
the requestor agrees. Conversely, the 
TEFCA Manner Exception allows for 
responding actors to limit a requestor 
who also participates in TEFCA to 
receiving EHI only via TEFCA when 
certain conditions are met by the actor, 
potentially slowing adoption of more 
innovative manners of access, exchange, 
or use than may be generally supported 
by TEFCA participants at any given 
point in time. Further, if an actor is 
unable to provide access, exchange, or 
use of EHI in the manner requested, the 
actor may find the Infeasibility 
Exception applicable to their 
circumstances, including the ‘‘manner 
exception exhausted’’ condition. 
With consideration of comments 
received in response to the CMS–ASTP/ 
ONC RFI and other RFIs, such as the 
Federal Trade Commission’s Request for 
Public Comment Regarding Reducing 
Anti-Competitive Regulatory Barriers 
(FTC–2025–0028), we have become 
concerned that the narrow TEFCA 
Manner Exception (applicable only to 
certain types of exchange) may create an 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  18:47 Dec 23, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\29DEP2.SGM 29DEP2

unintended ceiling on future growth of 
TEFCA by discouraging participation by 
new entrants for whom other manners 
of access, exchange, or use of EHI will 
more efficiently support their 
innovative products and services. 
Instead, TEFCA’s future growth will be 
supported by competition-oriented 
policies, compliance with applicable 
laws, and the continual advancement of 
efficient, interoperable manners of EHI 
access, exchange, and use of EHI that 
TEFCA supports. 
We note that removing the TEFCA 
Manner Exception would not remove 
any obligations an actor may have as a 
QHIN, Participant, or Sub-participant in 
TEFCA to fulfill TEFCA requirements. 
The TEFCA Manner Exception does not 
create, reduce, or otherwise affect any 
obligations any actor may have as a 
QHIN, Participant, or Sub-participant in 
TEFCA to fulfill TEFCA requirements. 
Finally, we remind readers that 
removing this exception would not 
mean that a practice that would have 
been covered by the TEFCA Manner 
Exception would automatically be 
considered information blocking. As 
always, for any practice to be 
considered information blocking, it 
must be examined on a case-by-case 
basis in order to assess the specific facts 
and circumstances and determine 
whether the practice meets the 
information blocking definition (see 
§ 171.103, see also IB.FAQ46.1.2022FEB: How would any 
claim or report of information blocking 
be evaluated).
81
 
Because the TEFCA Manner 
Exception (§ 171.403) is the only 
exception codified in subpart D of part 
171, we also propose to remove the 
entire subpart (subpart D). As currently 
codified, subpart D includes only three 
sections: § 171.400; § 171.401; and 
§ 171.403. The removal of § 171.403 
would render the remaining two 
sections unnecessary. Section 171.400, 
‘‘Availability and effect of exceptions,’’ 
mirrors §§ 171.200 and 171.300, stating 
that a practice shall not be treated as 
information blocking if the actor 
satisfies an exception to the information 
blocking provision as set forth in 
subpart D by meeting all applicable 
requirements and conditions of the 
exception at all relevant times (89 FR 
1388). Without any exceptions specific 
to practices related to an actor’s 
participation in TEFCA, § 171.400 
would serve no purpose. Similarly, 
§ 171.401 would serve no purpose 
because it only includes definitions for 
the subpart via cross-reference to the 
TEFCA definitions included 45 CFR 
part 172, ‘‘Trusted Exchange Framework 
and Common Agreement.’’ 
We welcome comments on these 
proposals. 
V. Incorporation by Reference 
The Office of the Federal Register has 
established requirements for materials 
(e.g., standards and implementation specifications) that agencies propose to 
incorporate by reference in the Code of 
Federal Regulations (79 FR 66267; 1 
CFR 51.5). Specifically, 1 CFR 51.5(a) 
requires agencies to discuss, in the 
preamble of a proposed rule, the ways 
that the materials they propose to 
incorporate by reference are reasonably 
available to interested parties and how 
interested parties can obtain the 
materials, and to summarize, in the 
preamble of the proposed rule, the 
material it proposes to incorporate by 
reference. 
To make the material we intend to 
incorporate by reference reasonably 
available, we provide a uniform 
resource locator (URL) for the standard. 
This standard is directly accessible 
through the URL provided. As an 
alternative, a copy of the standard may 
be viewed for free at the U.S.

Services, Office of the National 
Coordinator for Health Information 
Technology, 330 C Street SW, 
Washington, DC 20201. Please call (202) 
690–7171 in advance to arrange 
inspection. 
The NTTAA and the OMB Circular 
A–119 require the use of, wherever 
practical, technical standards that are 
developed or adopted by voluntary 
consensus standards bodies to carry out 
policy objectives or activities, with 
certain exceptions. The NTTAA and 
OMB Circular A–119 provide 
exceptions to selecting only standards 
developed or adopted by voluntary 
consensus standards bodies, namely 
when doing so would be inconsistent 
with applicable law or otherwise 
impractical. As discussed in section 
III.B.1.a of this preamble, we have 
followed the NTTAA and OMB Circular 
A–119 in proposing a standard for 
adoption, including describing any 
exceptions in the adoption of the 
standard. 
As required by 1 CFR 51.5(a), we 
provide a summary of the standard we 
propose to adopt and subsequently 
incorporate by reference in the CFR. We 
also provide relevant information about 
the standard throughout the preamble.

VII. Collection of Information 
Requirements 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (PRA), codified as amended at 
44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., agencies are 
required to provide notice in the 
Federal Register and solicit public 
comment on a proposed collection of 
information before it is submitted to the 
Office of Management and Budget for 
review and approval. In order to fairly 
evaluate whether an information 
collection should be approved by the 
OMB, section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA 
requires that we solicit comment on the 
following issues: 
1. Whether the information collection 
is necessary and useful to carry out the 
proper functions of the agency; 
2. The accuracy of the agency’s 
estimate of the information collection 
burden; 
3. The quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected; and 
4. Recommendations to minimize the 
information collection burden on the 
affected public, including automated 
collection techniques. 
Under the PRA, the time, effort, and 
financial resources necessary to meet 
the information collection requirements 
referenced in this section are to be 
considered. We explicitly seek, and will 
consider, public comment on our 
assumptions as they relate to the PRA 
requirements summarized in this 
section. 
A. ONC–ACBs 
We propose to descope the ‘‘Real 
World Testing’’ Condition and 
Maintenance of Certification 
requirements in § 170.405 with 
deregulatory actions related to real 
world testing plans, results, and the use 
of the standards version advancement 
process (SVAP). Consistent with these 
proposals to descope the Real World 
Testing Condition and Maintenance of 
Certification requirements, we propose 
to make conforming edits in 
§ 170.523(p) to remove the ONC–ACB 
review and confirmation process for real 
world testing plans in § 170.523(p)(1), 
and the submission of real world testing 
plans in § 170.523(p)(3) which requires 
ONC–ACBs to collect and report certain 
information to ONC related to real 
world testing plans (e.g., verify that the health IT developer submits an annual, 
publicly available real world testing 
plan and perform a completeness 
check). Our proposals in this proposed 
rule would not add any new collection 
of information burden and would 
instead reduce reporting burden 
associated with the proposed 
deregulatory actions. 
In the 2015 Edition proposed rule (80 
FR 16894), we estimated fewer than ten 
annual respondents for all of the 
regulatory ‘‘collection of information’’ 
requirements that apply to the ONC- 
Approved Accreditor (ONC–AA) and 
ONC–ACBs, including those previously 
approved by OMB. In the 2015 Edition 
Final Rule (80 FR 62733), we concluded 
that the regulatory ‘‘collection of 
information’’ requirements for the ONC– 
AA and the ONC–ACBs were not subject 
to the PRA under 5 CFR 1320.3(c). We 
continue to estimate less than ten 
annual respondents for all of the 
proposed regulatory ‘‘collection of 
information’’ requirements for ONC– 
ACBs under part 170 of title 45, 
including those previously approved by 
OMB and proposed in this proposed 
rule. Accordingly, the regulatory 
‘‘collection of information’’ 
requirements under the Program 
described in this section are not subject 
to the PRA under 5 CFR 1320.3(c). We 
welcome comments on these 
conclusions and the supporting 
rationale on which they are based. For 
the cost and burden reduction estimates 
related to these proposed deregulatory 
actions, we refer readers to section VIII 
(Regulatory Impact Analysis) of this 
proposed rule. 
B. Health IT Developers 
The ‘‘Insights’’ Condition and 
Maintenance of Certification 
requirements in § 170.407 include seven 
measures that health IT developers 
under the ONC Health IT Certification 
Program must annually report on 
consistent with specified regulatory 
compliance timelines. In the HTI–1 
Final Rule (89 FR 1399), we estimated 
the total crude upper bound burden to 
be 1,767,692 hours. In this proposed 
rule, we propose to remove and descope 
measures associated in § 170.407 to 
limit reporting requirements only to the 
‘‘use of FHIR in apps through certified 
health IT’’ measure, which would 
reduce reporting burden for health IT 
developers reporting under the 
Certification Program. In other words, 
we propose to reduce reporting burden 
associated with the Insights Condition 
and Maintenance of Certification 
requirements, and do not propose any 
new requirements that would add 
information collection burden. For more 
detailed discussion of burden reduction 
estimates of these deregulatory actions 
associated with the Insights Condition 
and Maintenance of Certification, we 
refer readers to section VIII (Regulatory 
Impact Analysis) of this proposed rule. 
VIII. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
A. Statement of Need 
E.O. 14192 on Unleashing Prosperity 
Through Deregulation, issued January 
31, 2025, sets the policy to ‘‘to 
significantly reduce the private 
expenditures required to comply with 
Federal regulations to secure America’s 
economic prosperity and national 
security and the highest possible quality 
of life for each citizen.’’
82
To that end, 
E.O. 14192 requires that ‘‘any new 
incremental costs associated with new 
regulations shall, to the extent permitted 
by law, be offset by the elimination of 
existing costs associated with at least 10 
prior regulations.’’
83
This proposed 
rule, if finalized as proposed, is 
expected to be an E.O. 14192 
deregulatory action and includes 
regulations and policies ASTP/ONC 
proposes to remove and revise to 
unleash prosperity. We believe the 
proposed changes will reduce burden 
on developers of certified health IT, 
returning time and effort to them, and 
in turn, enhancing competition, 
entrepreneurship, and innovation. 
These proposed deregulatory actions 
will reduce barriers to entry for novel 
technologies and digital health 
solutions, give time back to developers 
of certified health IT to focus on the 
needs and requests of their customers, 
and, overall, advance progress toward 
nationwide interoperability and 
universal patient access to their 
electronic health information. 
B. Overall Impact 
We have examined the impacts of this 
proposed rule as required by E.O. 
12866, ‘‘Regulatory Planning and 
Review’’; E.O. 13132, ‘‘Federalism’’; 
E.O. 13563, ‘‘Improving Regulation and 
Regulatory Review’’; E.O. 14192, 
‘‘Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation’’; section 202 of the 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(2 U.S.C. 1532); and the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (RFA) (Pub. L. 96–354). 
1. Regulatory Planning and Review 
Analysis 
This proposed rule implements 
relevant policy priorities outlined in 
E.O.s 12866, 13563, and 14192. E.O. 
12866 and 13563 direct agencies to 
assess all costs and benefits of available 
regulatory alternatives and, if regulation 
is necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, 
environmental, public health and safety

14192 directs agencies to repeal ten 
existing regulations for each new 
regulation issued in 2025 and thereafter 
and to account for cost savings 
associated with deregulatory actions. 
This proposed rulemaking, if finalized 
as proposed, is expected to be an E.O.

therefore prepared an RIA that to the 
best of our ability presents the expected 
significant cost savings to regulated 
entities generated by the proposed 
actions. 
a. Costs and Benefits 
These proposed deregulatory actions 
provide substantial relief for developers 
of certified health IT and significant cost 
savings realized from the revision and 
removal of certain program 
requirements. For the purpose of 
estimating the cost savings of this 
proposed rulemaking, we have 
determined that these policies would 
continue absent this regulatory action. 
The cost savings have been estimated 
using the best available data and 
modeled on the costs estimated and 
finalized in prior ASTP/ONC 
rulemakings. As articulated in the 
preamble, these proposed deregulatory 
actions reduce the effort of developers 
of certified health IT to meet ongoing 
program requirements and reduce 
barriers to entry for new program 
participants. The proposed actions, 
importantly, return effort back to 
developers of certified health IT to 
innovate their technology and focus on 
the needs of their clients and end users. 
Employee Assumptions and Hourly 
Wage 
We have made employee assumptions 
about the level of expertise needed to 
complete the requirements that are 
affected by this proposed rule. Unless 
indicated otherwise, for wage 
calculations for Federal employees and 
ONC–ACBs, we have correlated the 
employee’s expertise with the 
corresponding grade and step of an 
employee classified under the General 
Schedule (GS) Federal Salary 
Classification, relying on the associated 
employee hourly rates for the 
Washington, DC, locality pay area as 
published by the OPM for 2025.
84
We 
have assumed that other indirect costs 
(including benefits) are equal to 100% 
of pre-tax wages. Therefore, we have 
doubled the employee’s hourly wage to 
account for other indirect costs. We 
have concluded that a 100% 
expenditure on benefits and overhead is 
an appropriate estimate based on 
research conducted by HHS.
85
 
Unless otherwise noted, we have 
consistently used the May 2024 
National Occupational Employment and 
Wage Estimates reported by the U.S. 
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to 
calculate private sector employee wage 
estimates (e.g., health IT developers, health care providers, HINs, attorneys, 
etc.), as we believe BLS provides the 
most accurate and comprehensive wage 
data for private sector positions.
86
These 
wage estimates are a national average 
and we do not consider regional wage 
variation in our estimates. We also do 
not consider possible variation in the 
average wages for software developers 
in health care IT positions versus IT 
positions, more generally, which the 
BLS wage estimate is based upon. Just 
as with the General Schedule Federal 
Salary Classification calculations, we 
have assumed that other indirect costs 
(including benefits) are equal to 100% 
of pre-tax wages. We welcome 
comments on our methodology for 
estimating labor costs, including the 
effects of any regional or IT sector wage 
variation on our estimates. 
According to the May 2024 BLS 
occupational employment statistics, the 
mean hourly wage for a ‘‘Software 
Developer’’ is $69.50. As noted 
previously, we have assumed that other 
indirect costs (including benefits) are 
equal to 100% of pre-tax wages, so the 
hourly wage including other indirect 
costs for Software Developers is 
$139.00. 
Quantifying the Estimated Number of 
Health IT Developers and Products 
Given the wide range of proposed 
deregulatory actions, we have not 
adopted a single, over-arching approach 
to calculate the number of health IT 
developers and products affected by this 
rulemaking. We believe, however, that 
each current developer of certified 
health IT and participant in the 
Certification Program will be affected by 
these proposed actions, but that impact 
will vary, given the breadth and scope 
of each developer’s participation in the 
Certification Program. For each set of 
proposed actions, we describe our 
methodology for calculating the current 
number of health IT developers and 
products affected, and, where 
applicable, model estimated future 
counts of developers and products 
affected. 
Number of End Users That Might Be 
Impacted by ASTP/ONC’s Proposed 
Regulations 
The breadth and scope of the 
proposed deregulatory actions create 
immediate and significant cost savings 
for developers of certified health IT. As 
we have finalized in prior ASTP/ONC 
rulemakings—Cures Act Final Rule (85 
FR 25642) and HTI–1 Final Rule (89 FR 
1192)—we assume the regulatory costs 
imposed by those rules on developers 
may be passed on to end users of their 
technology in the form of increased fees 
and other costs. These deregulatory 
actions, though scoped to provide 
immediate relief and reduce ongoing 
burden on developers of certified health 
IT, may have downstream impacts on 
technology end users who may benefit 
from lower marginal costs to license and 
update their software; focused 
developers efforts on emerging end user 
needs; and other forms of innovation 
that may lead to unquantified benefits 
and savings for end users. We assume 
developers of certified health IT will use 
the cost savings to invest in innovation 
and emerging technology, rather than 
directly reduce costs on their end users, 
but, overall, believe the cost savings will 
create a net benefit to end users, if not 
directly as an immediate financial 
savings. 
Costs 
We do not expect costs to be 
associated with the deregulatory action 
proposals. We do, however, estimate the 
costs to review the rule. 
All entities affected by this proposed 
rule, if finalized, would spend time to 
read and understand the final rule, 
resulting in a one-time cost. The current 
Preamble and proposed regulatory text 
together contain approximately 64,727 
words; we use this as a proxy for the 
length of the final rule. Consistent with 
HHS guidelines, we assume that 
industry reviewers read at the average 
adult reading speed of approximately 
288 (64,727/225) words per minute, so 
the time to read and understand the 
regulation would be about 4 hours per 
person (288*60=17,280) (64,727/ 
17,280=3.75). We estimate the total 
number of reviewers by taking the 
number of estimated developers and 
adding an estimated number of medical 
associations that represent health care 
providers and health information 
networks, etc. The counts of developers 
included in Table R–1 were calculated 
using publicly available Certification 
Program data available through the

CHPL.
87
We took the estimated number 
of developers from Table R–1, which is 
444 developers and estimated 200 
medical associations.
88
We then 
determined that there would likely be 
644 individuals to review the proposed 
rule. As mentioned above, we used the 
May 2024 National Occupational 
Employment and Wage Estimates 
reported by the BLS to calculate private 
sector employee wage estimates.
89
We 
identified the ‘‘Management Analyst’’ 
position as comparable to a position that 
would review the rule. According to the 
May 2024 BLS occupational 
employment statistics, the mean hourly 
wage for a ‘‘Management Analyst’’ is 
$55.15. As noted previously, we have 
assumed that other indirect costs 
(including benefits) are equal to 100% 
of pre-tax wages, so the hourly wage 
including other indirect costs for a 
Management Analyst is $110.30. We 
estimate it will take four hours to review 
the proposed rule. Therefore, the total 
cost to review the rule for one reviewer 
would be $441.20 ($110.30*4). We took 
the estimated number of individuals to 
review the rule which is 644 and then 
multiplied that by $441.20 and 
calculated the estimated total cost to 
review the rule to be $284,132 
($441.20*644). 
Benefits 
We expect the proposed deregulatory 
actions to result in significant benefits 
for health IT developers, providers, 
ONC–ACBs, ONC–ATLs, and ASTP/ 
ONC. These expected benefits are 
detailed below. Generally, these benefits 
are in the form of cost and time savings 
and reductions in administrative burden 
to comply with Certification Program 
requirements. The proposed actions 
reduce the scope and breadth of 
program requirements. The proposed 
program revisions provide direct cost 
savings (quantified, below) to 
developers of certified health IT and 
their users (i.e., providers) through fewer program requirements and lower 
regulatory barriers, freeing up time for 
more innovation and meeting customer 
needs. In turn, the revised program 
requirements may reduce the 
implementation effort on ONC–ACBs, 
ONC–ATLs, and ASTP/ONC, who 
works with ACBs and ATLs to 
implement program requirements. 
These savings in time and effort to 
ONC–ACBs, ONC–ATLs, and ASTP/ 
ONC can be used toward remaining 
program improvement and 
implementation efforts, enhancing the 
operation and management of the 
program. 
1. Removal 
1.1 Removal of Certification Criteria 
We propose to remove 34 certification 
criteria. Of these, we propose to remove 
24 criteria as of the effective date of any 
final rule and the remaining ten criteria 
as of January 1, 2027. We developed a 
common model for estimating cost 
savings associated with the removal of 
all but one certification criterion, 
described below. For all criteria we 
assume that the cost savings from these 
criteria would begin January 1, 2027. 
Table R–1, below, provides criterion- 
level results of our model for 32 of the 
proposed criteria removals. For each 
certification criterion we identified the 
original costs to certify to the 
functionality from prior rules (the lower 
and upper bounds of ‘‘Total Hours’’ in 
Table R–1.)
90 91 92
We then assumed that 
the annual cost to maintain certification 
was a small fraction of the initial costs. 
We are not aware of any published 
evidence that would directly inform this 
calculation, and, therefore, developed a 
novel approach using various 
information sources. We defined this 
fraction (‘‘Final Effort Multiplier’’ in 
Table R–1) based on five factors: (1) 
‘‘Test’’: the criterion’s certification 
conformance method, assuming that 
criteria with a test procedure had 
additional maintenance costs while 
those with a conformance method of 
attestation had no additional cost 
beyond what was initially incurred; (2) 
‘‘Stakeholder feedback’’: stakeholder 
feedback received by ASTP/ONC 
through meetings, informal 
conversations, and letters from 
impacted parties on effort involved in 
certifying and updating the specific 
certification criterion; (3) ‘‘Complexity 
of standard’’: whether the criterion 
referenced a standard and an assessment 
of the complexity involved in 
maintaining and updating conformance 
to that standard over time, including 
through future regulatory requirements 
to update criteria to support new 
versions of the USCDI; (4) ‘‘Complexity 
of test procedure’’: an assessment of the 
complexity of the test procedure or 
evaluative work to support attestation 
when it was necessary to undertake the 
certification process; and (5) ‘‘General 
complexity’’: an overall assessment of 
the complexity of maintaining the 
certification criterion and underlying 
functionality. 
The ‘‘Final Effort Multiplier’’ is a sum 
of the five factors listed in the table and 
described above. We then used this 
multiplier to determine the annual costs 
of meeting and maintaining the 
individual criteria by taking the product 
of the lower and upper bound ‘‘Total 
Hours’’, described above, and this 
multiplier. We then estimated the lower 
and upper bounds of ‘‘Hours saved’’ by 
multiplying the ‘‘Annual’’ hours by the 
number of products that certify each 
criterion. The counts of developers and 
products included in Table R–1 are 
current as of May 1, 2025. The counts 
were calculated using publicly available 
Certification Program data available 
through the CHPL.
93
Although we 
primarily use the count of products to 
estimate ‘‘Hours saved’’, the count of 
developers is included for reference and 
comparison.

range from 272,344 to 456,052, among 
444 developers of certified health IT and 
589 certified products (Table R–1).

described above, we estimate the total 
undiscounted annual cost savings to 
range from $37,855,816 to $63,391,228. 
We welcome comments on the proposed 
methodology and the accuracy and 
validity of the model’s estimates. 
1.2 Removal of Safety-Enhanced 
Design 
Cost savings from the proposed 
removal of § 170.315(g)(3) safety- 
enhanced design (SED) is estimated 
separately from non-SED removed 
criteria. In the 2015 Edition Final Rule, 
we estimated that developers would 
spend 300 to 400 hours implementing 
the SED criterion at a cost of $63 per 
hour and that 266 developers would 
certify to SED. This resulted in a final 
cost estimate ranging from $5,027,400 to 
$6,703,200 in 2014 dollars. Since the 
finalization of that policy, we have 
received substantial input from 
developers of certified health IT that the 
cost estimates specified in that rule 
were an under-estimate of the initial 
and recurring costs associated with the 
SED certification criterion. In contrast to 
those estimates, we understand that 
individual developers of certified health 
IT incur recurring costs greater than 
$200,000 to recruit participants and 
conduct testing specified by the SED 
certification criterion. In response to 
input from the impacted community, we 
have revised our estimates of the costs 
of SED and potential cost savings that 
can be realized from the proposed 
removal of the SED certification 
criterion in this proposed rule. 
The SED certification criterion is 
required for all developers seeking 
certification to § 170.315(a)(1) through 
(5), (9) (until the certification criterion’s 
expiration date), (a)(14), (b)(2), (b)(3) or 
(b)(11). Developers must recruit at least 
ten participants, conduct testing, and 
submit metrics for each of the criterion 
for which they seek certification that is 
referenced within § 170.315(g)(3). Thus, 
we believe cost savings from the 
removal of SED are incremental per the 
number of dependent criteria certified 
because there are additional costs per 
product associated with SED testing and 
data reporting. Based on stakeholder 
input and because developers can 
certify multiple products each with up 
to ten criteria that requires SED, we 
believe an estimated annual cost of 
between $8,000 and $12,000 per 
product per certification criterion that 
requires SED testing is appropriate. This 
estimate represents the effort to design 
tests, recruit participants, conduct 
testing, document that testing, and 
report results to the ONC–ACB in the 
required format. 
To estimate the total costs of SED, we 
estimated the number of products that 
will be certified to SED and the number 
of SED criteria each product will certify. 
We report those costs in Table R–2. The 
count of products that are certified to 
SED and number of SED criteria each 
product certifies in the table are current 
as of May 1, 2025. The counts were 
calculated using publicly available 
Certification Program data available 
through the CHPL.

In total, 373 products are certified to 
SED and at least one SED certification 
criterion. Based on Table R–2, we 
estimate the total undiscounted annual 
cost savings from removing the SED 
certification criteria to be between 
$22,080,000 and $33,120,000. We 
welcome comments on the proposed 
methodology and the accuracy and 
validity of the estimates. 
2. Revisions 
2.1 Revision of Certification Criteria 
We propose to revise seven 
certification criteria. For each revised 
certification criterion, we have 
estimated the annual savings generated 
by the proposed revisions. 
2.1.1 § 170.315(a)(5) Patient 
Demographics and Observations 
We propose to codify certification 
guidance for the Certification Program 
exercising our enforcement discretion— 
specifically, for the ‘‘patient 
demographics and observations’’ 
certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(a)(5).
95
We expect this 
proposed revision to reduce the effort 
associated with meeting the 
requirements in § 170.315(a)(5) in the 
form of reduced maintenance costs. 
Using the approach described for 
removed criteria, we estimate that the 
removal of these requirements will 
reduce the annual effort of maintaining 
certification by 5% of the projected 
development costs estimated in the 
HTI–1 Final Rule. We note that 288 
developers have certified 352 products 
to § 170.315(a)(5) and that the initial 
developer hours estimated to implement 
updates to the criterion in the HTI–1 
Final Rule had a lower bound of 720 
hours and an upper bound of 1,860 
hours. We therefore estimate that the 
revision of this criterion will reduce 
effort by between 36 and 93 hours per 
product and 12,672 to 32,736 hours 
across all products. We estimate the 
total undiscounted annual cost savings 
for reduced maintenance to range from 
$1,761,408 to $4,550,304. 
2.1.2 § 170.315(b)(1) Transitions of 
Care 
We propose to revise the certification 
criterion in § 170.315(b)(1) to reduce 
burden on developers of health IT by 
removing the ‘‘send and receive via edge 
protocol’’ C–CDA requirement and 
‘‘create’’ C–CDA requirement in the 
criterion and by simplifying the 
remaining criterion requirements to 
focus solely on validating receipt of C– 
CDA documents. We believe that these 
revisions remove a substantial 
proportion of the ongoing effort required 
to maintain and update the functional 
requirement of the certification 
criterion, but we acknowledge that it 
does not remove requirements to 
support the C–CDA standard or to 
update functionality to receive C–CDA 
documents. We assume that this reduces 
the overall ongoing cost for this 
criterion by 60%. Following the 
methodology described for removed 
criterion, we considered annual 
maintenance of § 170.315(b)(1) to 
represent high complexity equivalent to 
15% of the initial development costs 
annually. We note from an analysis of 
current Certification Program data that 
256 developers have certified 300 
products to § 170.315(b)(1) and that the 
initial developer hours estimated to 
implement the criterion had a lower 
bound of 3,000 hours and an upper 
bound of 4,000 hours in the 2015 
Edition Final Rule (80 FR 62602).
96
We 
therefore estimate that the revision of 
this criterion will reduce effort to 
maintain the criterion annually by 9% 
annually or between 270 and 360 hours 
per product and 81,000 to 108,000 hours 
across all products. We estimate the 
total undiscounted annual cost savings 
to range from $11,259,000 to 
$15,012,000. 
2.1.3 § 170.315(b)(11) Decision 
Support Interventions 
We propose to remove all 
requirements related to source 
attributes, their access, and modification 
and requirements to manage risks 
related to the development of predictive 
DSIs. 
In the HTI–1 Final Rule, we indicated 
that the costs to implement 
§ 170.315(b)(11) ranged from 2,200 
hours to 4,600 hours, that updating 
source attribute information annually 
would cost an additional 0 to 1085 
hours annually, depending on the 
number of DSIs the developer supplied, 
and that engaging in risk management 
and updating information would result 
in an additional 0 to 285 hours 
annually. Without this revision, we 
estimate that annual maintenance costs 
for this criterion would represent 12% 
of initial development costs. We believe 
these changes reduce these costs by 
80% and would eliminate annual costs 
to update information for source 
attributes and risk management. 
In total, we estimate that the revision 
will reduce maintenance costs by 211 to 
1,812 hours per product. We note that 
232 products developed by 183 
developers were certified to 
§ 170.315(b)(11) resulting in an annual 
reduction of 48,952 to 420,384 labor 
hours. We estimate the total 
undiscounted annual cost savings to 
range from $6,804,328 to $58,433,376.

reporting-certification-criterion-enforcement- 
discretion-notice. 
2.1.4 § 170.315(c)(3) Clinical Quality 
Measures (CQMs)—Report 
We propose revisions to 
§ 170.315(c)(3) to remove expired 
standards references. These proposed 
revisions are considered de minimis and 
do not create net new cost savings. 
2.1.5 § 170.315(e)(1) View, Download 
and Transmit to a 3rd Party 
We propose to revise § 170.315(e)(1) 
to remove the standards referenced in 
§ 170.315(e)(1)(i), Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, 
and § 170.315(e)(1)(ii), Network Time 
Protocol (NTP) standard. We believe 
that the requirement to demonstrate 
conformance to the WCAG standard 
creates substantial burden for 
developers. We received feedback from 
developers that licensing a tool for 
WCAG assessments costs thousands of 
dollars annually. We acknowledge that 
the current referenced standards are old 
and do not easily work with newer 
versions of both the standard itself as 
well as testing tools to determine 
compliance. Thus, we expect these 
changes will reduce unnecessary burden 
associated with maintaining current 
conformance requirements as part of 
certification. In total, we estimate that 
the annual maintenance burden 
associated with the WCAG standard 
represented 2% of the initial 
development costs of the VDT criterion. 
We note that 215 developers have 
certified 255 products to § 170.315(e)(1) 
and that the initial developer hours 
estimated to implement the criterion 
had a lower bound of 1,300 hours and 
an upper bound of 2,000 hours in the 
2015 Edition Final Rule which included 
the updated WCAG requirement. We 
therefore estimate that the revision of 
this criterion will reduce effort to 
maintain the criterion annually by 2% 
annually or between 26 and 40 hours 
per product and 6,630 to 10,200 hours 
across all products. We estimate the 
total undiscounted annual cost savings 
to range from $921,570 to $1,417,800. 
2.1.6 § 170.315(f)(5) Transmission to 
Public Health Agencies—Electronic 
Case Reporting 
We propose to codify certification 
guidance for the Certification Program 
exercising our enforcement discretion 
for—specifically, the ‘‘Transmission to 
public health agencies—electronic case 
reporting’’ certification criterion in 
§ 170.315(f)(5).
97
We expect this 
proposed revision to reduce the burden 
associated with meeting the 
requirements in the eCR certification 
criterion in the form of reduced 
maintenance costs. Following the 
methodology described for removed 
criterion, we considered annual 
maintenance of § 170.315(f)(5), as 
finalized in the HTI–1 Final Rule and 
becoming effective on December 31, 
2025, to represent high complexity 
equivalent to 27% of the initial 
development costs annually. We 
estimate that removal of standards- 
based requirements will reduce annual 
maintenance costs to 10% of initial 
development costs, a 63% reduction in 
effort. 
Currently, 94 developers and 127 
products are certified to § 170.315(f)(5). 
Eighty-six developers and 112 products 
are certified to the ‘‘functional’’ 
requirements in § 170.315(f)(5)(i) alone, 
while 10 developers and 15 products are 
certified to the standards-based 
requirements in § 170.315(f)(5)(ii). The 
initial developer hours estimated to 
implement the criterion had a lower 
bound of 0 hours and an upper bound 
of 2,160 in the HTI–1 Final Rule. We 
therefore estimate that the revision of 
this criterion will reduce annual effort 
to maintain the criterion by between 0 
and 367 labor hours per product and 0 
to 46,609 labor hours across all 127 
products. We estimate the total 
undiscounted annual cost savings for 
reduced maintenance to range from $0 
to $6,478,651. 
2.1.7 § 170.315(f)(6) Transmission to 
Public Health Agencies—Antimicrobial 
Use and Resistance Reporting 
We propose to remove the standards- 
based requirements in § 170.315(f)(6) 
that were adopted in the 2015 Edition 
Final Rule and revise this criterion to be 
a functional requirement. We received 
stakeholder feedback that the CDA- 
based standards cited in this criterion 
are not required for users to submit 
antimicrobial use and resistance (AUR) 
data to the CDC’s National Healthcare 
Safety Network (NHSN), creating a 
disconnect between the criterion and 
what is used in practice. We expect the 
removal of standards-based 
requirements to better align with the 
NHSN’s goals for reporting and reduce 
the burden on developers to meet this 
requirement. Following the 
methodology described for removed 
criteria, we considered annual 
maintenance of § 170.315(f)(6) to 
represent medium complexity 
equivalent to 20% of the initial 
development costs annually. We 
estimate that removal of standards- 
based requirements will reduce annual 
maintenance costs to 6% of initial 
development costs, resulting in a 70% 
reduction in effort. 
Currently, 28 developers and 47 
products are certified to § 170.315(f)(6). 
The initial developer hours estimated to 
implement the criterion had a lower 
bound of 1,000 hours and an upper 
bound of 1,400 hours in the 2015 
Edition. We therefore estimate that the 
revision of this criterion will reduce 
effort to maintain the criterion annually 
by 14% or between 140 to 196 hours per 
product and 6,580 to 9,212 hours across 
all products. We estimate the total 
undiscounted annual cost savings to 
range from $914,620 to $1,280,468. 
In Table R–3, we estimate the total 
annual hours saved from the proposed 
criteria revisions to range from 155,834 
to 627,141 among 328 developers of 
certified health IT and 418 certified 
products. Using the labor rate of $139, 
described above, we estimate the total 
undiscounted annual cost savings to 
range from $21,660,9326 to $87,172,599. 
We welcome comments on the proposed 
methodology and the accuracy and 
validity of the estimates.

2.2 Revisions to Standards and 
Implementation Specifications for 
Health Information Technology 
2.2.1 Revisions to the United States 
Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) 
v3 
We propose to codify certification 
guidance for the Certification Program 
exercising our enforcement discretion— 
specifically, for the United States Core 
Data for Interoperability (USCDI) v3 
standard.
98
The action removed or 
revised data elements from USCDI v3, as 
finalized in the HTI–1 Final Rule (89 FR 
1192). 
As finalized in the HTI–1 Final Rule, 
developers of certified health IT were 
required to update and certify their 
Health IT Modules to adopt USCDI v3 
by January 1, 2026. This proposal 
reduces the effort for developers of 
certified health IT to adopt the USCDI 
v3 via the removal or revision of two 
data elements: sexual orientation and 
gender identity. We do not estimate 
reduced effort from ongoing 
maintenance of these requirements, as 
the effort is considered part of activities 
that occurred prior to the effective date 
of any final rule. We request comments 
on this approach. 
2.3 Revisions to the ONC Health IT 
Certification Program Administration 
Unless noted differently, proposed 
revisions to Certification Program 
administration conform to revisions 
proposed elsewhere related to 
Certification Program requirements. We 
do not assess net new cost savings or 
costs to program administration for 
these conforming revisions. We 
welcome comments on whether these 
conforming revisions create net new 
cost savings or costs. 
2.3.1 Principles of Proper Conduct for 
ONC–ACBs 
Under the principles of proper 
conduct for ONC–ACBs, we propose to 
revise the ‘‘certified product listing’’ 
principle in § 170.523(f)(1)(viii) to 
remove requirements on ONC–ACBs to 
include the test data version used and 
whether any test data was altered for the 
certification criterion or criteria to 
which the Health IT Module has been 
certified. This proposed revision is 
meant to reduce the overall effort for 
ONC–ACBs for this principle, as our 
analysis shows that these data elements 
for the ‘‘certified product listing’’ are 
low value. We determined that the cost 
savings to ONC–ACBs are de minimis, 
and welcome comments on this 
analysis. In addition, we propose 
conforming revisions to the principles 
of proper conduct for ONC–ACBs. These 
conforming revisions do not create net 
new cost savings to developers of 
certified health IT, ASTP/ONC, or ONC– 
ACBs. These conform to revisions made 
elsewhere to Certification Program 
requirements, and cost savings, if 
applicable, are assessed elsewhere in 
this impact analysis. 
2.3.2 Principles of Proper Conduct for 
ONC–ATLs 
We propose conforming revisions to 
the principles of proper conduct for 
ONC–ATLs. These conforming revisions 
do not create net new cost savings to 
developers of certified health IT, ASTP/ 
ONC, or ONC–ATLs. These conform to 
revisions made elsewhere to 
Certification Program requirements, and 
cost savings, if applicable, are assessed 
elsewhere in this impact analysis. 
2.3.3 Health IT Module Certification 
We propose conforming revisions to 
Health IT Module certification. These 
conforming revisions do not create net 
new cost savings to developers of 
certified health IT, ASTP/ONC, or ONC– 
ACBs. These conform to revisions made 
elsewhere to Certification Program 
requirements, and cost savings, if 
applicable, are assessed elsewhere in 
this impact analysis. 
2.3.4 Certification to Newer Versions 
of Certain Standards 
We propose conforming revisions to 
certification to newer versions of certain 
standards. These conforming revisions 
do not create net new cost savings to 
developers of certified health IT, ASTP/ 
ONC, or ONC–ACBs. These conform to 
revisions made elsewhere to 
Certification Program requirements, and 
cost savings, if applicable, are assessed 
elsewhere in this impact analysis. 
2.3.5 Effect of Revocation on the 
Certifications Issued to Health IT 
Module(s) 
We propose conforming revisions that 
do not create net new cost savings. 
2.4 Revisions to Conditions and 
Maintenance of Certification 
Requirements for Health IT Developers 
(Subpart D) 
2.4.1 Assurances Condition of 
Certification 
We propose updates to the Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR) that do not 
create net new cost savings. 
2.4.2 Application Programming 
Interfaces Condition of Certification 
We propose updates to the CFR that 
do not create net new cost savings. 
2.4.3 Real World Testing Condition of 
Certification 
We propose revisions to the Real 
World Testing Condition of Certification 
that de-scope reporting requirements 
and codify certification guidance for the 
Certification Program exercising our 
enforcement discretion for the 
Condition of Certification.
99
As

applicable for specific criteria—at the 
time of finalization, 23 criteria in all. 
This deregulatory action revises the Real 
World Testing Condition of Certification 
to apply reporting to only the API 
criteria adopted by the Certification 
Program. This revision creates cost 
savings to developers of certified health 
IT, as developers would no longer be 
required to plan, collect, and report on 
real world testing results for the full 
originally finalized set of criteria. We 
explain below the rationale and 
methodology that informed the cost 
savings for these proposed revisions to 
real world testing. 
The proposed revisions to real world 
testing would take effect beginning in 
2027. Cost savings to developers for 
ongoing compliance are, therefore, 
estimated beginning in 2027. Any costs 
for 2024 and 2025 are considered sunk. 
Beginning in the 2026 reporting year, as 
permitted in the real world testing 
enforcement discretion, only developers 
of certified APIs would be required to 
report for real world testing, specifically 
developers who certify to the 
standardized API for patient and 
population services certification 
criterion, § 170.315(g)(10).
100
Cost 
savings calculations beginning in 2027 
reflect the decreased burden on 
developers of certified health IT to 
comply with the condition of 
certification minus requirements that 
remain in place for developers who 
certify to the applicable API-based 
criteria. 
As of the end of 2024, using publicly 
available Certification Program data, we 
calculated that 336 developers had 
submitted real world testing plans for 
2025 collection and 2026 reporting.
101
 
That is 93 fewer developers required to 
report for real world testing than 
estimated in the Cures Act Final Rule— 
a decrease of about 19 developers per 
year.
102
Calculating developer exits 
during this time period, after the Cures 
Act Final Rule took effect and prior to 
this proposed rule’s effective date, is 
important to assess the estimated 
number of developers expected to 
comply with the remaining real world 
testing requirements, as proposed. 
Beginning in 2026, we calculated an 
expected count of developers who we 
estimated would be required to report 
for real world testing in 2026 and 
beyond. This count assumes attrition 
from the original count of developers 
required to report for real world testing 
as finalized in the Cures Act Final Rule, 
as we described above for years prior to 
2026. But given the changed program 
dynamics, in that real world testing 
would be required only for developers 
of certified APIs, the attrition rate 
beyond 2026 is harder to estimate. 
Given that current requirements are 
applicable for over 20 criteria adopted 
in the Certification Program and our 
attrition rate is based on participant 
exits from the Certification Program (for 
developers who certify for any of these 
criteria), we assume that attrition rate is 
likely more profound than exits for 
developers of certified APIs alone. We 
therefore estimate a new rate of 
developers who would be required to 
report for real world testing in total 
(n=320), beginning in 2026. 
In our RIA for the HTI–4 Final Rule 
(included in the FY2026 IPPS/LTHC 
PPS Final Rule (90 FR 36536) as an 
ancillary provision), we estimated that 
beginning in 2027, approximately 189 
developers would certify an electronic 
prior authorization API. The 189 count 
is a proxy measure, representing our 
estimation of the number of developers 
that would certify the § 170.315(g)(10) 
certification criterion in 2027. 
Given that the revised Real World 
Testing Condition of Certification would 
only be associated with developers of 
certified APIs, we estimate beginning in 
2026 that approximately 189 developers 
would be subject to the revised real 
world testing requirements. We used 
this count (189) to determine the net 
number of developers who would have 
been required to report for real world 
testing under the original requirements 
(inclusive of those who would have 
reported § 170.315(g)(10) testing results 
under the original requirements.) 
At the end of 2024, of the 336 
developers required to report for real 
world testing, 198 developers certified 
to the § 170.315(g)(10) certification 
criterion or 59% of all developers. Using 
this rate, we estimate that beginning in 
2026, approximately 320 developers 
would be subject to real world testing 
requirements, as finalized by the Cures 
Act Final Rule.
103
In 2026, however, 
only 189 developers would be subject to 
revised real world testing 
requirements—our estimate of the 
number of developers who would be 
subject to revised real world testing 
requirements (API only.) This considers 
some attrition but at a different rate than 
used for years prior to 2026, as 
explained above. 
Total savings beginning in 2027 are 
considered consistent and do not 
decrease due to future unknown 
attrition; however, we consider these 
cost savings to be realized by developers 
when the revised requirements take 
effect. If they were to exit the program 
in a year beyond 2027, these are still 
cost savings to be realized today from 
requirements they do not need to meet 
in all future years. 
Beginning in 2027, cost savings are 
calculated by totaling the cost to all 
developers who certify real world 
testing applicable criteria to meet 
current real world testing requirements 
as finalized in the Cures Act Final Rule 
and revised in subsequent rulemakings 
(the HTI–1 Final Rule and the HTI–4 
Final Rule) and subtracting the 
remaining cost for developers of 
certified APIs to comply with revised 
real world testing requirements. We 
estimate that, per developer, the cost of 
collecting and reporting real world 
testing data on § 170.315(g)(10) would 
be on average $4,400 annually. We 
estimate this by calculating the average 
cost per criterion to meet real world 
testing requirements as finalized by the 
Cures Act Final Rule ($109,557/23 = 
$4,763) and decrease that by the 
proposed eliminated effort to submit 
annual testing plans (estimated to be 8% 
of total annual testing effort.)
104
This is 
congruent with our methodology 
finalized in the HTI–4 Final Rule about 
the average per criterion cost to plan, 
collect, and report for real world 
testing.
105
The total cost of the 
remaining requirement to test for 
§ 170.315(g)(10) would be subtracted 
from the total original program cost, as 
finalized by the Cures Act Final Rule, to 
estimate this deregulatory action’s 
annual cost savings. 
Beginning in 2027, we also assume 
that developers of certified APIs would 
need to meet requirements for 
§ 170.315(g)(10), as well as for 
§ 170.315(g)(31), (g)(32), and (g)(33), as 
finalized in the HTI–4 Final Rule.
106
 
Real world testing requirements for the 
certification criteria adopted in 
§ 170.315(g)(31), (g)(32), and (g)(33) 
were finalized in the HTI–4 Final Rule 
and would be a net new cost minus 
revisions to real world testing for 
developers not to submit annual testing 
plans. Furthermore, we also updated 
real world testing requirements in the 
HTI–4 Final Rule to include the new

§ 170.315(b)(4) certification criterion, 
which created net new costs to 
developers for real world testing. This 
deregulatory action now removes the 
§ 170.315(b)(4) real world testing 
requirement and so we also assess the 
cost savings from that revision 
beginning in 2027 as well. 
We estimate cost savings for reduced 
upfront effort in 2027 to be (original real 
world testing costs + § 170.315(b)(4) 
planning costs) minus (§ 170.315(g)(10) 
revised costs), which equal $35.1 
million in undiscounted cost savings for 
2026. For costs savings, beginning in 
2027 and in perpetuity, we estimate that 
together, (original real world testing 
costs + § 170.315(b)(4) costs) minus 
((g)(10)+(g)(31)+(g)(32)+(g)(33) revised 
costs) equal the estimated annual 
undiscounted cost savings of $33.6 
million. 
2.4.4 Attestations 
We propose updates to the CFR that 
do not create net new cost savings. 
2.4.5 Insights Condition of 
Certification 
In the HTI–1 Final Rule (89 FR 1192), 
we finalized requirements for 
developers to report on the Insights 
Condition of Certification, a set of 
uniform measures collected and 
reported by developers of certified 
health IT about the performance of their 
certified technology.
107
Applicable 
developers would be required to begin 
data collection January 1, 2026, for 
‘‘Year 1’’ measures, with results 
reported in July 2027 and with ‘‘Year 2’’ 
measures set to begin collection January 
1, 2027. Effort to plan and develop 
capabilities for these finalized measures 
was estimated to begin after the effective 
date of the HTI–1 Final Rule in January 
2024. Effort to plan and develop the 
measurement capabilities for measures 
required to be collected in 2026 (‘‘Year 
1’’) would be completed by January 1, 
2026, and effort to plan and develop the 
measurement capabilities for measures 
required to be collected for the first time 
in 2027 (‘‘Year 2’’) would be completed 
by January 1, 2027, etc. We estimated 
developers would face annual data 
collection and reporting costs beginning 
in 2026 and in perpetuity. As we 
finalized in the HTI–1 Final Rule, the 
large majority of costs to developers of 
certified health IT would be costs to 
plan and develop for initial data 
collection of the finalized measures 
(effort largely expended from 2024–2026 
in our original analysis). 
ASTP/ONC issued enforcement 
discretion in April 2025 that effectively 
de-scoped Insights requirements on 
developers to a single measure—‘‘Use of 
FHIR’’—a ‘‘Year 1’’ measure.
108
The 
enforcement discretion effectively 
paused development and planning 
efforts to collect all Insights measures 
but one (‘‘Use of FHIR’’), reducing sunk 
costs and creating cost savings to 
developers by reducing the upfront 
effort to plan and report for Insights. We 
propose to codify certification guidance 
for the Certification Program exercising 
our enforcement discretion for the 
Insights Condition of Certification. We 
explain below the rationale and 
methodology that informed the cost 
savings for these proposed revisions to 
Insights. 
To calculate cost savings associated 
with the proposed revisions to the 
Insights Condition of Certification, we 
subtracted the estimated amount for 
developers to report for the remaining 
Insights measure (‘‘Use of FHIR’’) from 
the estimated cost for developers to 
meet the Insights Condition of 
Certification, as finalized in the HTI–1 
Final Rule. In Table 35 of the HTI–1 
Final Rule, we estimated that the upper 
bound cost for all developers to report 
on the ‘‘Use of FHIR’’ measure over a 
ten-year period was $36.3 million.
109
 
The total upper bound cost to report on 
all measures for all developers over a 
ten-year period was $218.7 million. 
Therefore, we estimate the ‘‘Use of 
FHIR’’ measure to be 17% of all 
estimated Insights costs. 
In Table R–4 we show the 
undiscounted revised costs for the 
Insights Condition of Certification. We 
estimated, on average, that the HTI–1 
Final Rule costs for Insights would be 
$137.9 million. We estimated that the 
cost for developers to begin 
implementing Insights in 2024 (toward 
effort to collect and report on measures 
in 2026 and 2027) would on average, 
total $46.4 million. This included initial 
planning and development costs for all 
measures with more assumed effort 
toward completing work to prepare for 
‘‘Year 1’’ measures set to begin 
collection January 1, 2026. We consider 
these costs as sunk. The Insights 
enforcement discretion, however, 
reduced effort for ongoing planning and 
development work for 2025 and after. 
We consider this reduced effort in 2025 
and 2026 and reduced effort to meet this 
requirements in years 2027 and after to 
be a net cost savings to developers, as 
Table R–4 shows. 
Cost savings in 2027 and thereafter 
are considered tied to the reduced effort 
associated with ongoing planning and 
reporting for the proposed revised 
requirements. The total undiscounted 
cost savings for this reduced ongoing 
effort, beginning in 2027, are $12.7 
million (Table R–4).

$284,132 in total for an estimated 644 
reviewers, which include developers 
and medical associations. As articulated 
in the preamble, these proposed 
deregulatory actions reduce the effort of 
developers of certified health IT to meet 
ongoing program requirements and 
reduce barriers to entry for new program 
participants, generating benefits to 
developers of certified health IT in the 
form of time back to them to innovate 
their technology and focus on the needs 
of their clients and end users. We do 
not, however, quantify these benefits, 
and instead rely on our calculation of 
cost savings to developers of certified 
health IT to quantify in dollars the time 
and effort developers would have 
expended had these requirements 
remained in effect in perpetuity. We 
estimate that these proposals do 
generate significant cost savings for 
developers of certified health IT. 
To calculate the cost savings 
associated with this proposed 
rulemaking, we replicate the analysis of 
prior finalized rulemakings and align 
those with current data, adopting, where 
necessary, novel methodologies and 
models to assess the current costs to 
developers of certified health IT of the 
proposed revisions to the Certification 
Program. As shown in Table R–5, we 
present the undiscounted cost savings 
over ten years and in Table R–6 we 
present the discounted cost savings 
associated with these proposals. In 
Table R–6, we adopt a 3% and 7% 
discount rate consistent with Circular 
A–4 (2003).
110
Cost savings for this 
proposed rulemaking include savings 
from reduced ongoing effort to comply 
with finalized requirements, as shown 
in Tables R–5 and R–6. In total, this 
proposed rulemaking would result in a 
present value of cost savings of $1.53 
billion in 2024 dollars and discounted 
at a rate of 7%, beginning in 2027 and 
in perpetuity, consistent with analytic 
guidance on E.O. 14192, as shown in 
Table R–7.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
requires agencies to analyze options for 
regulatory relief of small businesses if a 
rule has a significant impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
The Small Business Administration 
(SBA) establishes the size of small 
businesses for Federal Government 
programs based on average annual 
receipts or the average employment of a 
firm.
112
 
The entities that are likely to be 
directly affected by the requirements in 
this proposed rule are health IT 
developers. We note that the reasonable 
and necessary activities identified by 
the Secretary as not constituting 
information blocking are themselves 
exceptions to compliance with the 
information blocking definition and

provide relief for those entities subject 
to the information blocking regulations. 
We refer readers to section IV for our 
information blocking-related proposals 
and welcome comments on their 
impacts on small entities. 
While health IT developers that 
pursue certification of their health IT 
under the Certification Program 
represent a small segment of the overall 
information technology industry, we 
believe that many health IT developers 
impacted by the requirements proposed 
in this proposed rule most likely fall 
under the North American Industry 
Classification System (NAICS) code 
541511 ‘‘Custom Computer 
Programming Services.’’ 
OMB advised that the Federal 
statistical establishment data published 
for reference years beginning on or after 
January 1, 2022, should be published 
using the 2022 NAICS United States 
codes.
113
The SBA size standard 
associated with this NAICS code is set 
at $34 million annual receipts or less. 
There is enough data generally available 
to establish that between 75% and 90% 
of entities that are categorized under the 
NAICS code 541511 are under the SBA 
size standard. We also note that with the 
exception of aggregate business 
information available through the U.S. 
Census Bureau and the SBA related to 
NAICS code 541511, it appears that 
many health IT developers that pursue 
certification of their health IT under the 
Certification Program are privately held 
or owned and do not regularly, if at all, 
make their specific annual receipts 
publicly available. As a result, it is 
difficult to locate empirical data related 
to many of these health IT developers to 
correlate to the SBA size standard. 
However, although not perfectly 
correlated to the size standard for 
NAICS code 541511, we do have 
information indicating that over 60% of 
health IT developers that have had 
Complete EHRs and/or Health IT 
Modules certified to the 2011 Edition 
have less than 51 employees. 
With the exception of rule review 
costs, this proposed rulemaking is 
deregulatory and does not create new 
requirements on developers of certified 
health IT, including small businesses. 
We believe the proposed deregulatory 
actions will create net cost savings for 
developers and would not create a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
Additionally, the Secretary proposes to 
certify that this proposed rule would not 
have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities. 
However, we request comments on 
whether: there are (and how many) 
small entities that currently pursue 
certification of health IT under the 
Certification Program; what products 
they certify; whether there are any 
negative or unintended costs for small 
entities from the proposals included in 
this proposed rule; and whether small 
entities will significantly benefit from 
the proposals include in this proposed 
rule. 
D. Executive Order 13132—Federalism 
E.O. 13132 establishes certain 
requirements that an agency must meet 
when it promulgates a proposed rule 
(and subsequent final rule) that imposes 
substantial direct requirement costs on 
State and local governments, preempts 
State law, or otherwise has federalism 
implications. Nothing in this proposed 
rule imposes substantial direct 
compliance costs on State and local 
governments, preempts State law, or 
otherwise has federalism implications. 
We are not aware of any State laws or 
regulations that are contradicted or 
impeded by any of the proposals in this 
proposed rule. We welcome comments 
on this assessment. 
E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 
1995 
Section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 requires 
that agencies assess anticipated costs 
and benefits before issuing any rule that 
imposes unfunded mandates on State, 
local, and Tribal governments or the 
private sector requiring spending in any 
one year of $100 million in 1995 dollars, 
updated annually for inflation. The 
current inflation-adjusted statutory 
threshold is approximately $187 million 
in 2025. This proposed rule is 
deregulatory, and, therefore, the 
estimated potential cost effects of this 
proposed rule do not reach the statutory
